: A Quarter Ahead1THERE WAS A YOUNGMAN I HAD seen often around Times Square . Like me , he was there almost every night ; and like me , too , he was , I knew , hustling . I would learn later his name is Pete . Althougheach of us had noticed the other  --  and it was obvious  --  we avoided pointedly more than glancing at each other whenever we met : He was very cocky , a wiseass ; and , I figured , I struck him much the same way . One night I saw him by the subway entrance on 42nd Street talking to an older man dressed in black . It was a warm night . After a series of wintry ones , the warmth returned miraculously and the street is crowded tonight , each person clutching for one last taste of a springlike night . . . . Theyre glancing at me , Pete and the older man . They talk some more , the older man nods yes , and Pete swaggers up to me . He said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said sport like that : " spote. " ) "  --  he 'll lay ten bucks on you  --  and itll be like cuhrazy , " rolling his eyes . Pete 's in his early 20s , not tall , very well built , dark ; knowing eyes , sometimes moody , dreamy . I Ies wearing an army fatigue cap rakishly almost over his eyes , so that he has to hold his chin up to look at you ... . I turned and looked at the black-dressed man , and he smiled broadly at me , walked toward us . If he had worn a white collar , he would have looked like a priest . Pete says to me : " This is Al , " indicating the older man , pats my shoulder  --  " Later , spote "  --  and disappears jauntily into the street , almost bouncing into the crowd . " I havent seen you before  --  youre new ? " the man in black was saying . He did nt wait for an answer : If he asks too many quesCityof Night 41tions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get an entirely different answer from the one he wants to hear and it will shatter his sexdream . I went around the corner with the black-dressed Al , down from 42nd Street  --  wordlessly  --  to a large room in an apartment house . " I do nt live here , " he explained as he opened the door into an almost-bare room : a bed , a table , two chairs . " I just keep this place  --  well  --  as a Convenience . " He asked me to take my clothes off , but , " Not the pants , theyll do , " he tells me . He went to a large closet , and brought out some clothes . Theres a black leather jacket with stars like a general , eagled motorcycle cap , engineerboots with gleaming polished buckles . He left the closet door open , and I could see , hanging neatly , other similar clothes  --  different sizes , I knew . On the floor were at least seven pairs of engineer boots , all different sizes . " Ive reached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell the exact size by just glancing at the person , on the street . . . . Here , put these on . " I did , and they fitted . " Fine ! " he said . " Now lets go . " Im startled . " Where ? " I asked him . " Outside , " the man says , then noticing me hesitating suspiciously : " I just want us to take a little walk . Do nt worry  --  I 'll pay you . " That night , for about an hour , I walked with him through Times Square , from block to block in that area , into the park , silently  --  just walked . A couple of times I was tempted to leave , walk away with his clothes  --  but Im curious and I need the money . At the end of the hour we returned to the room , I removed the clothes . He did nt touch me once . He hands me $10.00 . I looked at him surprised . I thought somehow I had disappointed him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said ; he smiles . " You were fine , just fine , " he says , sensing whats troubling me . " But , you see , " he said , rather wistfully , " thats all I want ; to be seen along Times Square with a youngman in those clothes . " A few minutes later , I was back on 42nd Street , and Pete was still there , slouched outside the spaghetti place . He smiled at me . " Some scene , huh ? " he said . " Did he give you anything for it ? " I ask him . " What do you think , spote ? He gives me five bucks for everyoneI get him . I meet him once every two , three weeks . He spots someone he digs , I introduce him . He s too shy to talk to anyone , 42 JOHN RECHYso I do it for him , and he lays some bread on me  --  and I do nt have to do nothing , " he says smartly . " Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , sure ! " He laughed . " And thats all he digs , spote . He dresses everyone he goes with in that motorcycle drag  --  and it bugs him for me to call it that . Then he walks around with them . Hardly anybody ever walks away with his clothes  --  theyre too curious . He s hung up on that drag , thats how he gets his Kicks . ... Oh , sure , I been with him . " Then proudly  --  his gaze shifting back and forth from me to the street , pegging people  --  he adds : " Im the only cat he walked around with two nights  --  in a row ! " 2Pete was a familiar figure in that world of Times Square . With his slouched army fatigue cap and his thick shaggy army jacket which he had dyed brown , his bouncing walk  --  it was easy to spot him in any crowd . After that first night , I would meet him often , never by arrangement , but always at about the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together for a while , and then , compulsively , we 'd split . Often , minutes later , we would meet again standing in the same place . Although he was n't much older than I  --  but because , as he told me , he 'd been hustling the streets since he was 16  --  Pete liked to play the jaded , all-knowing street hustler , explaining to me how to make out . He had a series of rules : Walk up to people , do nt wait to be asked ; if you do , you may wait all day . Forget about the vice squad , and youll never get caught . A quick score in a toilet for a few bucks can be worth more than a big one that takes all day . Stand at the urinal long after youre through pissing . At the slightest indication of interest from someone in one of the cubicles , go up to him quickly before he gets any free ideas and say : " I 'll make it with you for twenty . " But go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat in Bickford 's in the cold light , he told me without embarrassment that once he 'd gone for 75  --  . " It was a slow day , " he explained , " and I had only four bits , just enough to make the flix . I thought , I ) o I buy a Hotdog or make the flux and try to score ? It was raining  --  no one on the streets . So I made the flix . City of Night 43No scores . Then someone wants to give me 75  --  , and Im in the balcony anyway , so I let him . Hell , man , " he adds pragmatically , " I was a quarter ahead  --  I could still have that Hotdog . " And he goes on : " Youll learn ; sometimes youll stand around all day and wait for a 15-buck score , a 10-buck score , even a deuce  --  all day  --  so , hell , take what comes , spote  --  so long as it do nt louse up all your time  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That way they think they got a Bargain . " Part of Pete 's technique as a hustler was to tell the men he 'd been with that he knew other youngmen like himself , and if they wanted , he would fix them up . Like a social secretary , he kept mental dates when he 'd meet certain people . If he still did nt have someone for the score , they would walk around Times Square until the man spotted someone he wanted . Pete would make the introductions  --  as he had that night with me and the blackdressedAl  --  and would get a few bucks for it . . . . There was one problem , Pete explained : As the score got to know more and more people , he 'd dispense with Pete 's services . Occasionally , we sat in the automat , talking for a long time , Bragging , exaggerating last night 's Big Score . Soon it would turn bitter cold , he warned me ( and , already , the wind raked the streets savagely ) , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets keener . " You can shack up with someone permanent , though , " he told me , looking at me curiouslyas if he were trying to find out something about me ; " but me , " he added hurriedly , " I do nt dig that scene  --  I guess Im too Restless . " He made it , instead , from place to place , week to week , night to night . Or , he told me , he 'd stay in one of the all-night movies . Sometimes he would rent a room off Seventh Avenue where they knew him . " And if you ai nt got a pad any time , spote , " he said , " you can pad there too . " Then he changed the subject quickly . " I dig feeling Free all the time , " he said suddenly , stretching his arms . And I could understand those feelings . Alone , I , too , felt that Enormous freedom . Yet . . . there was always a persistent sensation of guilt : a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOHN RECHYI still lived in that building on 34th Street , its mirrored lobby a ghost of its former elegance . I paid $8.50 a week for the room . Opposite my window , in another wing of the same building , lived an old man who coughed all night . Sometimes he kept me awake . Sometimes it was the old , old woman who staggered up and down the hallway whistling , checking to see that no one had left the water running in the bathrooms or the gas burning in the community kitchen . At times it was Gene de Lancey  --  the woman with the demented eyes I had met the first day in the hallway  --  who kept me up . Once she had been Beautiful  --  she had sighingly shown me pictures of herself , then !  --  now she was sadly faded , and her eyes burned with the knowledge . She seldom went out , although I did see her on the street one late afternoon , shielding her face with her hand . She 'd knock on my door sometimes early in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would wonder if she listened for me to come in . I would open the door , and shes standing there in a Japanese kimono . " Lambie-pie , " she 'd say in a childish whimper , " I just couldnt sleep , I just got ta have a cigarette and talk  --  Steve 's asleep  --  " That was her present husband . "  --  and I knew you wouldnt mind , sweetie . " She would sit and talk into the morning , with such passion , such lonesomeness , that I couldnt bring myself to ask her to leave . She would tell me about how everyone she had ever loved had left her : her mother , dead  --  her father , constantly sending her to boarding schools as a girl  --  her two previous husbands , Gone  --  her son , disappeared . " Theres no love in this harsh world , " she lamented . " Everybody 's hunting for Something  --  but what ? " When , finally , she would get up , she would kiss me on the cheek and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he says : " Great , man , she sounds like a swinging nympho  --  lets make it with her together some-time ! " Like the rest of us on that street  --  who played the male role with other men  --  fete was touchy about one subject : his masculinity . In Bickford 's one afternoon , a goodlooking masculine youngman walked in , looked at us , walked out again hurriedly . " That cat 's queer , " Pete says , glaring at him . " I used to see him and I thought he was hustling , and one day he tried to put themake on me in the flix . It bugged me , him thinking I was queer or something . I told him fuck off , I wasnt gon na make it for free . " He was moodily silent for a long while , and then he said almost belligerently : " Whatever a guy does with other guys , if he does it for money , that do nt make him queer . Youre still straight . It 's when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that you start growing wings . " .. . And because this is such a big thing in That life , youll hear untrue stories from almost everyone whos paid someone about the person he s paid . It 's a kind of petty vindication , to put down the hustler 's masculinity  --  whether correctly or not  --  at the same time that they seek it out . Standing on the street , Pete would always come on about the young girls that would breeze by like flowers , the wind lapping at their skirts coyly ... . I found out Pete can be vengeful . I saw him in Bryant Park and he was fuming . The manager of a moviehouse one block away had refused to let him in . ( I had seen the manager  --  a skinny , tall , nervous , gaunt , pale-faced man . The theater is one of the gayest in New York . Late at night men stand leaning along the stairways , waiting . ) " He s a queer , " Pete said angrily , " he do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it do nt go on for money  --  thats why he wouldnt let me in . " Later , Pete tells everyonethe place is crawling with plainclothes vice squad , ready to raid it : Stay Away ! And the theater balcony was almost empty for weeks . He also told me that another hustler had taken a score from right under his nose in the park , and Pete went around telling people the other hustler had the clap .... " Make it anyway you can , " he said when he finished telling me that , " and when you cant make it , get even . " He knew almost everyone on the street who paid . He would point them out to me . " See that blond pale kid ? He pimps for this old guy : real swank pad , too . And , man , what a weirdo that old guy is . Dig : he pays by the hour , and talks , talks , talks !  --  he s a teacher or something  --  laid up in bed from an accident . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and he never knew the difference , just kept on talking .... " 46 JOHN RECHYAt least once I regretted not listening to Pete 's advice . " See that one over there ? " he said , pointing to a **26;4571;TOOLONG man in a raincoat . " Stay away from him , spote , he s psycho . " But remembering what he had told everyone about the theater whose manager wouldnt let him in , and remembering what he 'd done to the hustler whod taken his score in the park , I figured this may be some kind of revenge on the man for whatever reason . The man looked entirely harmless , and I went with him . After we had made a very ordinary scene  --  and I still had nt got any money from him  --  his composure changed suddenly into savage rage . Before I knew it , he had pulled a knife on me . I dashed out , down the creaking steps . Like a demon  --  his shadow flung grotesquely down the stairs  --  he stands at the landing shouting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of you ! " 3I also learned not always to trust Pete . One sharply cold windy Sunday afternoon  --  the clouds sweepingthe newyork sky like sheets  --  I saw him coming toward me where I was standing . " You wan na score ? " he says . " See that old cat over there ? " He pointed to a small mousy man a few feet away . " He wants us both to come over to his house . He s only good for five , " he explained , adding quickly when he saw me hesitating : " but most of the time he 'll lay more if he digs you .. . . Cummon , man , " he coaxed me . " Lets go with him . It 's a draggy day anyhow . And anyway , we get to eat there real good . " He adds , smiling secretly : " And we do nt have to do much . Oh , he s Special ! " Remembering the man I had walked around Times Square with , wearing a jacket and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , " Pete says , " we wont be walking around Times Square in leather . " Without going to him , Pete motions yes to the man , who goes down the steps , into the subway . Pete and I follow . I was walking fast , to catch up with Hie man . " Cool it , " Pete explains . " I know where we get off . " Without glancing back , the man gets in one of the cars , and we got in another . " He does nt want anyone to see him leaving with guys , " Pete said . I had been through this before : Unlike the black-dressed Al , who walked you around for an hourCity of Night 47through Times Square , some scores do nt want to be seen leaving the street with a younger man . " He lives in  --  hold on  --  Queens ! " Pete laughed . " And dig this , spote : I think he teaches at Queens College . They even got a school now , " he says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and followed the man to a large apartment house . We waited at the corner for a few minutes , and then we walked into the lobby . It 's a moderate-priced apartment house , very quiet , softly lighted . We reached the second floor , and along the hallway , a door was open slightly . There stood the little man beaming at us sweetly . He had taken off his coat , and he was wearing a gayly colored apron now . " Hello , hello , hello ! " he chirped merrily . " Im so glad you boys could come . I was hardly expecting  --  " Pete whispered to me ( I couldnt see how the man could help but hear him , but possibly neither cared ) : " Play it Cool and go along with it . " At times Pete seemed to have an enormous tolerance for the quirks of the people he knew : a tolerance which could instantly turn into intolerance when he felt he 'd been had . " Itll be just a few minutes , boys , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a Lovely dinner . You boys must be famished , and I just happen to have some Very Nice Steaks . Now , " he says , and his voice trembles slightly , " you boys get  --  uh  --  Comfortable . " He stood watching us intently . I glanced at Pete , and he had begun to unbutton his shirt . " Do what I do , " he told me , but I was strangely embarrassed suddenly , because by then Pete was taking off all his clothes . " Come on , man , " he says to me , annoyed . " You wan na score or do nt you ? " ( Again , I knew the man , his gaze nailed on us , could hear him , and I realized conclusively this did nt matter . ) " This cat 's pretty swinging people if he digs you , " Pete goes on , " and we can come back and have ' dinner . ' " He laughed again . " Come on . " I finally did . Pete sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was completely unembarrassed . I sat on a chair looking at a magazine . The man returned to the kitchen , humming gayly . " It 'll be just a few more minutes , now , boys  --  " He turned at the door and looks fondly at Pete . " Petey-boy , " he said , " I do believe youve been gaining a few pounds  --  you should have more salads , less starches . . . . You boys do nt know how to care for yourselves , 48 JOHN RECHYbut we 'll fix that . . . . And you , my boy  --  " turning now to me like a doting mother "  --  you could stand a bit more weight  --  just a few more pounds , not much  --  and we 'll fix that too . " He disappeared into the kitchen , and I could hear dishes rattle . I glanced up abruptly , and Pete is looking at me over the comic book . He smiles broadly . Soon , the meal was served , on a small , carefully set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tinkling little bell which the man jingled . I had never eaten like this before , and I start to put my pants on . Pete said no , emphatically , reminding me we 're in the presence of " cool people " and I should play along . We sat at the table  --  just Pete and myself , facing each other . The man flutters in and out of the kitchen like a butterfly , returning , serving us lovingly , rearranging the silver , the glasses  --  standing back to see that they were Just Right . There was no place for him . He brought a chair and set it away from the table . He sat there , staring raptly as we ate . Completely unself-consciously Pete ate his food . I dropped my fork a couple of times , and the man rushed into the kitchen to get me a clean one . Finally we had finished , and the man places a cake before us , gives us a large portion . " And there 's ice cream ! " he announced joyously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Chocolate . " I took vanilla . " All boys love cake and ice cream , " the man said knowingly , and by then I was enjoyingit . I even ate more cake . " Now a nice rest , " the man said . His voice shook slightly , as when he asked us to get " Comfortable . " We went into the bedroom , where there were twin beds . Pete lay in one , I lay in the other . The man came in with a chair , which he stations between the two beds . " Now take a long rest , " he said . Pete is looking at me steadily , as if to remind me to play along ; winks  --  then pretendsto fall asleep immediately . He even snored a couple of times . I lay iu bed , my eyes supposedly closed , but I was glancing at the man : Ile sat on the chair , his chin propped on his hands : staring fixedly from one to the other ; occasionally his face would brighten up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After about 15 minutes , he " woke " us , and we sat in the bedroom , on one bed , Pete and I , and played checkers , while the man watched us with the fascinated attention of a child enjoyingCity of Night 49a cartoon . Pete couldnt play checkers , and we sat there merely moving them back and forth . " We 'll have to go now , Mom , " Pete said finally . I looked at him startled . Had he called him " Mom " ? Pete nods at me , indicatingI must do the same . I couldnt bring myself to call him " Mom . " The old man looked at me with a hurt look . " We 'll have to go now , Mom , " Pete repeated . He gives me an exasperated look . " Oh , must you ? " the man said . " Im so sorry you cant stay longer . " He removed the apron , rubbed his hands on it , folded it neatly , and he went into the kitchen . Pete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns , hands me $5.00 . " You fucked up , spote , " he told me , shaking his head . " You did nt call him Mom . Just five bucks . When he s real happy , he lays ten . " He shook his head regretfully . " But we can come again , and if youre cool we 'll score more . Why  --  didnya  --  call  --  him  --  Mom ? " A week later , alone , I ran into the same man . This time he knew me and he came and talked to me . " Do you have a young friend whod like to come up and have dinner with us ? " he asked me . " I havent seen Petey-boy here today , " he said , glancing around for him . " If you find another nice youngman , we 'll have a lovely dinner , and youll each be $10.00 richer . " " Ten ? " I said . " Why , child , " he said somewhat indignantly , " I always give ten . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That Pete ! " he said , and I thought he was going to stamp his foot . " He s done it to me again . Why , I bet he only gave you five . " I felt embarrassed to admit I 'd been taken , and I said , no , he 'd given me ten . " Well , Im relieved ! " the man said . " He s done that before , you know  --  gives his young friend only five , and keeps fifteen . But what can I do ? It embarrasses me so , when Ive first met a youngman , to give him the money . Idont reallyknow whattodo . " Then he smiles Tolerantly . " But Petey is a lovely youngman  --  only  --  only  --  " He frowns slightly . "  --  only I wish he would n't call me Mom . " When I saw Pete again , one night in Bryant Park , I mentioned the money to him . He looked at his feet , pretending  --  I was sure he was pretending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust no one too much , " he mumbled . Then he reached for his wallet , 50 JOHN RECHYbrought out three dollars . " Thats all I got now , " he said , sighing ( " What Am I Going To Do Now ? ! " ) . " Here , take em , " he said . I did , and he stared at me in surprise . " Youre learning , spote , " he said . A few days later I got even with him . I told him I knew a girl who wanted to be a stripper . I had met her not too long ago in the lobby of an apartment house I had just scored in . Her name was Flip , and she asked me to come up with her  --  just like that . She shows me sexy pictures of herself , turning me on . She was very pretty , very young . To the groaning sounds of " Night Train " she began to do a strip  --  then stopped coquettishly ; tells me poutingly shes sorry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , zoll  --  " ( Thats how she said doll. ) "  --  little Flip 's got the mean rag on . " Suddenly I realized without doubt that Flip was a man . She was the first dragqueen I had ever been with . I did nt let her know I had found out , and she went ahead and did what she told me she liked anyway . . . . When it was over , she says : " If you know any other cute zolls , tell them about me . Im always Ready , zoll . " When I told Pete about Flip ( leaving out that she was actually a dragqueen ) , she too sounded like a nympho to him . " I got ta meet that chick , " he told me  --  and later , I took him to her apartment . " We 'll all three make it together , " he said enthusiastically , " it 's Sexier that way . " And although he kept insisting as we stood outside Flip 's door that I should stay , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring the bell , " I told him . " She wont even ask who you are . She ' ! l just let you in . " I waited on the steps until I saw him ring the bell . The door opened . I heard Flip squeal : " Ooo , you are a zoll ! " ' L'hat night I expected perversely to see an indignant Pete . But when I saw him , he said : " Mani  --  what a great Lay that chick is ! " ... I felt very smug  --  and very surprised. 4Then , one day  --  in the midst of that cold bitter winter , when the snow cut across the streets like an icy knife and the wind shrieked like something from Hell  --  one day , the memory of myMother  --  accentuated by the long painfully written three-times-aweekletters without punctuation asking when I would be Back , asking me to promise not to get into trouble  --  that memory seized me with a racking violence  --  and I decided to put down Times Square again  --  a pattern of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a Foundation dedicated to Spreading The Greatness of The American Way of Life . And I kept away from The Streets . At night I would stay home or go to the movies -- but not on 42nd Street or The Others . But  --  again  --  that job lasted only briefly , and impulsively , I quit . The cold air outside struck me like my lost freedom , regained . That very night I was back on Times Square . " Where you been , spote ? " Pete said . " I thought you got busted or something , I looked around for you . Do nt split like that again , hear ? " For the first time since I had known him , we shook hands . After that , I saw him more and more often . Sometimeshavingscored  --  we would meet afterwards and sit in the automat at 42nd and Park Avenue ( this appealed to him as Classier ) . He told me he was staying in the room which the black-dressed Al rented to keep his motorcycle clothes in . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " but I finally conned him into letting me . " Yet , although I saw Pete at least once a day now , there was still the urgency , on both our parts , to split abruptly  --  to get away from each other . Occasionally , we would go see " Mom . " And the initial embarrassmentI had felt was completely gone : It was always the same scene , the man never touched either of us , he merely sat staring . Once he even took a picture of us at the table . By now Pete had learned how to play checkers . And one afternoon , strangely  --  as Pete and I sat on the bed playing checkers for much longer than we ever had before , as if there had been no third party , no " performance , " actually enjoying it  --  with startlingsuddenness " Mom " abandoned his role as watcher , as doting mother , and nervously , claiming A Huge Headache , he ' sked us to leave . He folded the board hurriedly and abruptly dumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he almost slammed the door . " What bugged him ? " Pete asked ; then , shrugging , dismissing52 JOHN RECHY it , " I guess he did have a bad headache  --  shes kinda weird , any- way . . . . Fuck-im . " We did nt go back . 5 Now the nights began to warm up . It 's that magnificent inter- lude in New York between winter and spring , when you feel the warmth stirring , and you remember that the dreadful naked trees will inevitably sprout tiny green buds , soon . Everyone rushes into the parks , the streets  --  and you even forget that , very soon , sum- mer will come scorchingly , dropping from the sky like a blanket of steam .... " I do nt feel like fuckin around today , " Pete told me one afternoon . He seemed pensive . " Lets just make the flix , spote  --  and forget all about trying to score . " We saw a double feature  --  one , a French movie about Lesbians in a girls ' school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky beaded wondrously with spring stars . " You really believe two chicks could dig each other that tough ? " Pete asked me . I an- swer , " Sure . " I was wondering what had prompted such amaz- ing , for him , naivete . " It sure seems strange , " he went on . " Dig : I can see guys making it with each other  --  sure  --  for money  --  but  --  ... Well , it sure seems strange , just digging each other like that  --  and those two chicks , man , they were both beautiful . " We were standing outside . Even the lights on the signs seemed livelier in the warm air . I did nt have any place to go , but I said , " Later , " to Pete . This is how it had always been before . " No , wait , " he says , " do nt split  --  unless you got something to do . " " Nothing , " I said . " Lets stick together , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around tonight , " he said moodily . We went to a cafeteria on the same block and ate . The drifting youngmen were in there , sitting at the tables sipping coffee , star- ing at the older men who walked in . " Sometimes this whole scene bugs me , " Pete said . " I guess maybe I should split  --  leave New York  --  go somewhere else : L.A. , maybe . You wan na know some- thing ? I been in the East all my life  --  New Jersey  --  New York . . . . " He stared dreamily out the window . " Lets go to Washington Square ! " he said abruptly . In a few minutes , by subway , we were there . In Washington Square there were many people . In the center , around the fountain , the young painters and their girlfriends clustered ; some had baby carriages . They seemed very happy . And I felt the same . I was sure it was the approaching warm weather . . . . One youngman with a beard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I sat by the fountain , listening . Soon , we got up , walked around the west side  --  toward the " meat rack "  --  the gay part of the park . There , it was as if someone had hung a line of marionettes on the railing : the lonesome young homosexuals , legs dangling , looking , waiting for that onenight'ssexual connection .... " This wouldnt be a good place for scoring tonight anyway , " Pete says , " theres too many out for free fun . " But we sit there too , silently . Next to us , a Negro queen has nervously stationed herself-a screamingly effeminate youngman in a candy-striped shirt : twisting her neck haughtily , looking around her in pretended disdain . Soon a couple of her white " sisters " swish by , two equally effeminate youngmen . They stand talking to the Negro queen , gossiping breathlessly . Now theyre talking about gowns .

" says one of the white queens , a fiercely blond one , affecting a thick Southern accent . The Negro queen 's eyes open Wide . " Are you trying to dish me , Mary ? " she says angrily . " Money , " said the blond one , " all Ah asked was a simple question : Wasnt thuh Queen of Shayba White ? For all Ah know , you painted yuhself White . " " Mary , " says the Negro queen , ready to spring from the railing , " I may not be the Queen of Sheba , exactly , but I am The Queen of This Meat Rack  --  and I 'll prove it to any nellyassed queen that wants to try me . " " Youretoomuch , " says the blond one airily . " Why ! whoevuh heard of a nigguh Queen ? " In one instant , the Negro queen jumps off the railing , grabs the blond one by her thin shoulders and shakes her back and forth until she begins to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Negro queen . Finally , the Negro queen lets go , and the blond one rushes off wailing : " Mothuh-fuckuh , if we wuz in The South , Ahd show you whos Queen of thuh Meat Rack ! " .. . Pete said moodily : " She shouldnuh called her a nigger . " A fat zero-policeman comes by swinging his stick like a baton : " Move on , move on , " he says . " Yes , sir , officer , sir , " Pete says , raising his middle finger up at the cop as he passes by . . . . We move on , and it was beginning to get cool  --  the hint of spring withdrawing teasingly . We walk again through Washington Square . The guitarist with the beard has left , and we sit on a bench . Sitting there with Pete , a great Loneliness overwhelmed me . Was it the sky ? So like a Texas sky at night  --  the stars flung prodigiously in the expansive blackness . Or the sudden breathtakingmemory of my Mother miles away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me .... Or was it the sudden change in the park ? The youngmen and girls had left  --  the older people were gone from the benches too . Now there remain only the hunting young homosexuals looking for a partner . They sit momentarily on benches , move away , stand restlessly . One sat near us . " You figure he thinks we 're queer ? " Pete asked me indignantly  --  and then he stared him away . . . . I wondered if the franticness of their search was overwhelming Pete as it was me ; he was strangely silent ... . Two youngmen walked by . Previously I had seen them standing a few feet apart , on the walk , moving slowly closer to each other . Then they had talked briefly  --  now they walked away together , speaking softly . They were both young , both goodlooking . I saw them smile at each other : For them , this night 's search was over  --  not for money  --  but for a mutual , if fleeting , sharing . Staring after them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even . They look like hustlers , do nt they ? And I bet theyre gon na make it with each other . " We move along Fifth Avenue , past a dimlit bar in a hotel . Through the windows we see a woman playing the piano . A man is leaning over her , her lips move in a song , she slides closer to him .... We pause for a while , and then we continue walking  --  into Union Square now , where we stand listening to a man in aCity - of Night 55tight suit heatedly hollering about what a blight Union Square is . " Perverts and tramps ! " he yells . And a little old tramp stag- ' gers up to him , he reeks of wine , his nose like a red lightbulbandhe shakes his old finger unsteadily at the man yelling out damnation and says : clearly : " Listenere , you  --  you jes listenere : ' I'heres gon na be hobos ! homos ! and momos ! in Our Park long after youve grown deaf and dumb ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " whats a momo ? " " I do nt know , I guess he just made it up . " " Thats cute , " says Pete . " Homos , hobos and  --  and  --  what ? " " Momos , " I said . " Yeah : Momos . Hey ! Maybe we 're momos ! " he laughs . Weve reached 34th Street , the corner of the Armory on Park Avenue . " Heres where I live , " I told Pete now . " Can I come up and talk a while ? " he asked me , rushing the words together . " Im tired , " I said quickly . " Cummon , " he insisted , " it 's early yet  --  or you can come up with me . Im still staying at Al 's with all the motorcycle jackets . Come up there , I got a pint of juice , we 'll kill it . " " It 's too far , " I told him . He looked hurt . " Okay . Lets go to my place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorman in the building where I lived : a Negro from Jamaica : a clinging relic , like the mirrored lobby , of its sadly gone elegance : Beyond the lobby and the doorman  --  who sits in a little room , nodding asleep through the night  --  the buildingis seedy two-room apartments and gray rooms  --  layers of wallpaper make the walls soft like quilts ; the plumbing rattles ; steam gives out on the coldest days . . . . We went up in the complainingelevator , into the apartment , broken up , in turn , into smaller apartments , tiny rooms . I turned on the light . " This is nice , " Pete said , looking at the dingy room . One thing was colorful : a Mexican blanket which my mother had sent me . . . . " I wish I had a place of my own , " Pete says . " You know , I actually been thinking of getting a small apartment  --  with someone , maybe  --  you know , split the rent  --  it wouldnt be much that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spote ? " 56 JOHN RECHYI pretended I had nt heard him . . . . But long before that night when I had resolved to explore this world not with one person but with many , I had become aware that there was something about someone getting too close to me which suffocated me ... . " Maybe , " Pete says , going on , " maybe  --  you know  --  I was just thinking  --  shacking up with another guy for a while  --  we could hustle together , really make the scores . It wouldnt be hard : I know lots of scores . Theyd stop digging me ; dig you ; so on  --  I mean , whoever it was , we would keep going like that . . . . I was even thinking  --  Christ  --  well  --  that fuckin street  --  it bugs me  --  sometimes I get nightmares about those toilets  --  I mean , all those fags  --  and  --  well , if I got a job , even  --  and split the rent with someone  --  well  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For a long while there seems to be nothing to say . Im aware of a smothering self-consciousness between us . I wanted him to leave . It was the first time anyone other than the curious men and women in the other rooms had been in this room with me . " Can I stay here tonight ? " I heard him ask clearly . In a kind of panic , I want to say no . " Yes , " I answered . The lights are out now . The darkness seems very real , like a third person waiting . I lay on the very edge of one side of the bed , and he lay on the very edge of the other . A long time passed . Hours . " Are you asleep ? " he asked me . " No  --  I cant sleep . " " Me neither , " he says . " Maybe I should go . " But he did nt move . More silence . And then I felt his hand , lightly , on mine . Neither of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand closes over mine , tightly . And that was all that happened . The man in the other wing of the building , on the other side of my window , began to cough very early , and I got up hurriedly and dressed . " I have to go out , " I told Pete . " Me , too , " he said . " I have to see someone . " We avoided looking at each other . " I 'll see you around TheCity of Night 57Street , " he said at the door . " Man , " he says  --  but his voice was forced , as mine was , " I got a real tough score lined up todayhesworth Twenty . " " Later , " I said . " Later  --  spote , " he said . I saw him again , many times  --  in the movie theaters , in Bryant Park , on Times Square . We would say hello to each other , stop , talk casually : He would exaggerate his scores , I would exaggerate mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I have to score , " one of us would say , and we 'd split . Soon we wouldnt stop to talk to each other when we met . We would say hello , rush on . . . . And then one day , one stifling summer day , I saw him bouncing along the street in my direction . I turned sharply , pretended to be looking at some movie posters ; and glancing back once , briefly , I noticed that he  --  for the same reason I had turned away , to avoid meeting  --  had crossed to the other side of the street . CITY OF NIGHTHTE WORLD OF TIMES SQUARE was a world which I was certainI had sought out willingly  --  not a world which had summonedme . And because I believed that , its lure , for me , was much more powerful . I flung myself into it . Summer had come angrily into New York with the impact of a panting animal . Relentless hot nights follow scorching afternoons . Trains grinding along the purgatorial subway tunnels ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lurching cars , a crew of Negro urchins dance appropriately to the junglerhythmcdbongoes ) expel the crowds  --  From All Points  --  at the Times Square stop .... And the streets are jammed with sweating faces . The chilled hustling of winter now becomes the easy hustling of summer . At the beginning of the warm days , the corps of newyork cops feels the impending surge of street-activity , and for a few days the newspapers are full of reports of raids : UNDESIRABLES NABBED. ' f'hc cobs scour Times Square . But as the summerdays proceed in sweltering intensity , the cops relent , as if themselves bogged down by the heat . Then they merely walk up and down the streets telling you to move on , move on . Inevitably yours hack in the same spot . For me , a pattern which would guide my life on the streets had already emerged clearly . I would never talk to anyone first . I would merely wait at the pick-up places for someone to talk to me  --  while , about me , I would see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My inability to talk first was an aspectCity of Night 59of that same hunger for attention whose effects I had felt even in El Paso  --  the motive which had sent me away from that girl who had climbed Cristo Rey , long ago , with me : I had sensed her yetunspokendemands for the very attention which I needed , and she had sensed them in me too , I am certain . . . . And so , in the world of males , on the streets , it was I who would be the desired in those furtive relationships , without desiring back . Sex for me became the mechanical reaction of This on one side , That on the other . And the boundary must not be crossed . Of course there were times when a score would indicate he expectedmore of me . Those times , inordinately depressed , I would walk out on him instantly . Immediately , I must find others who would accept me on my own terms . From the beginning , I had become aware of overtones of defensivederision aimed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very masculinity they would later disparage  --  as if convinced , or needfully proclaiming their conviction , that the more masculine a hustler , the more his masculinity is a subterfuge : " And when we got into bed , that tough butch.numberheturned over on his stomach and I  --  . . . " a score had told me about a very masculine youngman I had seen on the streets . Later , I would hear that story more and more often . Whether that was true or not of the others , with me , there were things which categorically I would not  --  must not  --  do to score . To reciprocate in any way for the money would have violated the craving for the manifestation of desire toward me . It would have compromised my needs .... The money which I got in exchange for sex was a token indication of one-way desire : that I was wanted enough to be paid for , on my own terms . Yet with that childhood-tampered ego poised flimsily on a structure as wavering and ephemeral as that of the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here that I could be surfeited , if anywhere ) , it needed more and more reassurance , in numbers : a search for reassurance which at times would backfire sharply  --  insidiously wounding that devouring narcissism . In a bar with two men from out of town who have come to explore , on vacation , this make-out world of Times Square , I agree to meet them later at their hotel room in the East 20s . When I got there that night  --  and after I had knocked loudly60 JOHN RECHYseveral times  --  the door opened cautiously on a dark room . One of the men peeked out , said , hurriedly in order to close the door quickly : " Im sorry but weve got someone else now ; lets make it tomorrow . " But there were others to feed that quickly starved craving . In theater balconies ; the act sometimes executed in the last rows , or along the dark stairways . . . . In movie heads  --  while someone watched out for an intruder ; body fusing with mouth hurriedly  --  momentarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each desperate moment of the day  --  and which only the liberation of Orgasm seemed then to be able to vanquish , if only momentarily . . . . Behind the statue in Bryant park ; figures silhouetted uncaringly in the unstoppable moments ... . Still , for me , there were those days of returning to what had once constituted periods of relative calmness , in my earlier years , when  --  to Escape !  --  I would read greedily . . . . Now , at that library on Fifth Avenue , I would try often to shut my ears to the echoes of that world roaring outside , immediately beyond these very walls . Again , I would read for hours . And this would be a part of the recurring pattern , when impulsively I would get a job , leave the streets , return to those books to which I had fled as a child . But because there would always be , too , that boiling excitement to be in that world which had brought me here  --  and , equally , the powerful childhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  emotionally I was constantly on a seesaw . And I began to sense that this journey away from a remote childhood window was a kind of rebellion against an innocence which nothing in the world justified . In the library one night as I sit in the reading room surrounded by serene-masked people like relics from a distant world , a handsomeyoungman said hello to me . He sat at the same table . Noticing that he kept smiling and looking at me  --  at the same time that I felt his leg sliding against mine  --  I left . Sharply , I resented that youngman . His gesture had an implied attraction within the world of mutually interested men . While I could easily hang out with other youngmen hustling the same streetsCity of Night 61 ( although , since Pete , I seldom did for more than a few minutes , preferring to be alone ) , with them there was a knowledge  --  verbally proclaimed  --  that we were hunting scores , not each other . With this youngman just now , there had been the indication that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he had been attracted to me ... . The youngman followed me outside . As I cut across Bryant Park , I heard his steps quicken to approach me . " I 'd  --  like to meet you , " he said , the last words hurried as if he had rehearsed the sentence in order to be able to speak it . " Im going to go eat now , " I said , avoiding even looking at him . " All right if I sit with you and just talk ? " he asked me . He was masculine in appearance , in actions . He could not have been over 20 . But already there was a steady , revealing gaze in his eyes . We went to a cafeteria . As we sat there , he told me he was a student at a college , he lived with his parents . On weekends he worked at the library . . . . Throughout his conversation , there were subtle references to the homosexual scene , which I did nt acknowledge . . . . Afterwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked along the river . " I 'd like to go to bed with you , " he said bluntly . " We could rent a room somewhere . " Remembering Pete with a sense of utter helplessness , and surprisingmyself because of the gentleness with which I answered this youngman , I said : " Youve got me all wrong . " In the following days ( on this unfloating island with that life that never sleeps  --  in this city that seems to generate its energy from all the small , sleepy towns of America , sapped by this huge lodestone : the fugitives lured here by an emotional insomnia : gathered into like or complementary groups : in this dazzling disdainfully heaven-piercing city ) , in those following days , I discovered Third Avenue , the East 50s , in the early morning , where figures camped flagrantly in the streets in a parody stagline ; the languid " Hi " floating into the dark , the feigned unconcern of the subsequent shrug when you do nt stop .... 62 JOHN RECHYAnd there was Howard Thomson 's restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then for the one last opportunity before the rising sun expelled them , bringing the Sunday families out for breakfast . I discovered the bars : on the west side , the east side , in the Village ; one in Queens  --  appropriately  --  where males danced with males , holding each other intimately , male leading , male following  --  and it was in that bar that I first saw flagrantly painted men congregate and where a queen boy-girl camped openly with a cop . . . . But because most of those bars attracted large numbers of youngmen who went there to meet others like themselves for a mutual , nightlong , unpaid , sexsharing  --  or for the prospect of an " affair "  --  the bars made me nervous , then ; and , largely , I avoided them . The restlessness welled insatiable inside me . I discovered the jungle of Central Park  --  between the 60s and 70s , on the west side . In the afternoons , Sundays especially , a parade of hunters prowled that area  --  or they would sit or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even in the brilliant white blaze of newyork sun , it was possible to make it , right there , in the tree-secluded areas . At night they sat along the benches , in the fringes of the park . Or they strolled with their leashed dogs along the walks . . . . The more courageous ones penetrated the park , around the lake , near a little hill : hoods , hobos , hustlers , homosexuals . Hunting . Young teenage gangs lurk threatening among the trees . Occasionallythe cops come by , almost timidly , in pairs , flashing their lights ; and the rustling of bushes precedes the quick scurrying of feet along the paths . Unexpectedly at night you may come upon scenes of crushed intimacy along the dark twisting lanes . In the eery mottled light of a distant lamp , a shadow lies on his stomach on the grasspatchedground , another straddles him : ignoring the danger of detection in the last moments of exiled excitement ... . In Central Park  --  as a rainstorm approached ( the dark clouds crashing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the lightning )  --  once , one night in that park , aware of an unbearable exploding excitement within me mixedCity of Night 63with unexplainable sudden panic , I stood against a tree and in frantic succession let seven night figures go down on me . And when , finally , the rain came pouring , I walked in it , soaked , as if the water would wash away whatever had caused the desperate night-experience . THE PROFESSOR : The Flight of the Angels1THE MAN IN BED  --  STARING AT me appraisingly  --  was enormous . In one hand he held a pastel-blue cigarette  --  poised , daintily between two puffed fingers . He brings the cigarette studiedly to his mouth and blows out a shapeless cloud of uninhaled smoke . He looks crazily like a pink-faced genie emerging from the smoke . The other hand held a tape-measure , which is partly wrapped about his sagging fat neck . . . . He s somewhere in his 60s . His head is shaved completely . Huge dark eyes bulge behind thick glasses , like the crazy eyes painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in this well-furnished apartment , stands a young malenurse , who has brought me here from Times Square . He is perhaps 28 , coldly blond , with a very pale face  --  a premature Oldness , a bitter knowingness . He acts like a haughty movie butler who feels superior to the guests . Even on the street when he approached me , he had looked at me with unconcealed contempt ; lighting a cigarette as we walked here , not offering me one . Scattered about the floor are manuscripts , books , magazines . The room is cluttered with statues , unhung paintings , vases with withered flowers . There was a large ugly German beer mug on a mantle . Now the malenurse is looking at the old man  --  waiting , I knew , for some sign of approbation or displeasure from him . After long moments of staring at me , unwinding the tapemeasure , winding it again , puffing elegantly on the pastel-blue cigarette , the old man , propped halfway up in the hospital bed , said finally : City of Night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face shaped a smile  --  molded as if on pink clay . " Im not one bit disappointed , " he announced grandly . " But then I never am  --  thanks to Larry here , " acknowledging the malenurse . " Larry knows my subtlest moods , my changing ( oh , so changing ! ) tastes  --  and he s only been with me  --  how long , Larry ? " The malenurse answers quickly : " Four months , Professor . " " Ah , yes , of course , four months ! " The man in bed goes on : " It 's unfortunate that the world does nt recognize talent like Larry 's openly . Larry would be an Enormous Success . But then there are many things the world does nt recognize . Yes . . . . Fine , Larry , now , if youll excuse us  --  " The malenurse walks out , almostbrushing my shoulder , without looking at me . " My dear youngman , " the old man announces , " you are about to join the ranks of : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " he said . " Yes , do bring that chair over . Not that one : the other one , it 's more comfortable , and I want you to be Comfortable .... Careful , now  --  my manuscripts . Push them aside , child  --  neatly , neatly  --  I was looking through some things before you came . " Sighing deeply , he waves a chubby hand over the room , indicating the books and manuscripts litteringthe floor . " They are : Relics  --  from another life ! . . . Now , first of all , let me explain some exterior situations : You see me here , now , in this hospital bed , where Ive been for months and months : Suffice it to say : an Eternity ! An automobile struck me  --  and it would have been Poetic justice , yes , if I could say I had been hit by a gigantic truck  --  driven by a young handsome truckdriver , who knelt to gather my shattered heap of flesh ( you see : I say ' shattered heap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Life wrecks all illusions  --  but you will find that out later ) , and to whom  --  had it been just such a handsome young truckdriver , though the very instrument of my infirmity  --  I would owe my life : There would have been something extravagantly Sexual  --  " He affected a slight tremor . "  --  about being struck by a truck -- -ummm  --  Well ! . . . But , oh , the perversity of life : no such magnificent luck . It was no such earthangel who ran into nu  --  : but  --  ah , perversity , dear boy , keep it in mind : Perversity ! - I66 JOHN RECHYwas hit by a nervous , highstrung , skinny , homely , ineffectual , simpering oldmaid from Oklahoma , vainly trying to compete with our own glorious system of cabs ! Not that I have anything against Oklahomans . As you will learn , I have some fond memories of  --  But that comes later . . . . And so it has taken all those months . This frail mechanism ( if I may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ha , ha  --  but I speak only relatively )  --  this frail mechanism called the body has refused to heal . In other words , the hip bone is no longer connected to the  --  How does that song go ? . . . Anyway , you see me now rigged up in a 20th-century torture  --  not entirely unlike those used by the Inquisitors of old . . . . But do bring your chair closer , youngman  --  I want to hear every word you say , every phrase ... . You will notice I have a hearing aid  --  which at times I feel must indeed be connected to an electronic god , who whispers all kinds of naughty electronic gossip to me . And , sometimes , alas ! falls deadly silent . . . . But you see , I am a bit of a poet , and you will understand  --  later , because I hope you will become my angel . ( Robbie , forgive me , forgive me ! ) " He entreated Heaven . He draped the tape-measure loosely about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie limp along his body . I noticed a little red wire clamp marking a certain spot on the measure . " My dear boy , " he explained , " Robbie is my Guardian Angel  --  about whom you must hear  --  but later  --  perhaps in another interview , a precious interview  --  because I am also a philosopher . The poet stands in awe of life , and the philosopher penetrates it  --  and I do both . And life , my dear , dear young angel , is a long series of Interviews . And so : On With The Terms , to plunge , as in epic poetry , in rnedias res . . . . Lets dispense with the  --  uh  --  matter of  --  funds . Larry , I can suppose  --  uh  --  met you on one of our numerous streets , and so I take it you are  --  uh  --  seeking  --  ( how did one street angel put it to me not too long ago ? Oh , yes : )  --  bread : a fitting designation for funds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Essential : ... bread . I will give you ( this is always a rather touchy subject , and so I have established a fixed fee )  --  $7.50 an hour , and if a fraction of an hour , the full amount . All right ? ... Very good , thats Marvelous ! And you will come to see me as often as  --  " His voice broke , he stares at the red mark on the tape-measure . "  --  as often , " he finished sighingly , City of Night 67 " as the interviews shall last .... " He reaches for a Kleenex , also pastel-colored , and touches his nose delicately . " Very well , then . ... Im looking forward to knowing All About You , my novice angel . Angel ! " He puckered his lips and threw me a kiss . " I am all love , my dear boy  --  every inch ( and there are , oh , so many ! ) , every thought , every sigh  --  all Love : Love , dear child , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move closer . Yes . Now on with our First Interview !  --  the most important , really  --  in which we will get to know each other  --  in which we will turn a searchlight on the wonder of our mutual lives  --  ignoring momentarily the ugliness , of which  --  " he said sadly "  --  of which  --  there is  --  so much . . . . Ah , life  --  that vast plain of  --  what ? . . . Like a cold card dealer , God deals out our destinies : It was mine to be born ugly . . . . But let me , now  --  by way of establishing an Important Contact with you  --  let me tell you , now , about The Angels .... " He leaned back on the bed like a puffed-up balloon . I imagined him in a Macy Thanksgiving parade , wobbling from side to side with enormous eyes . . . . He reaches now for another cigarette  --  retrieves a lavender one , studies it , sets it back in the box . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " is for later : at the last of our interview . Now  --  lets see  --  " He finds a pink one , chooses it . " Pink  --  the color of a young flower .... " I was staring fascinated at the enormous buttonround eyes in the incredibly childlike flesh of his face . " I always like to know my angels  --  intimately , " he went on . " It is so necessary . And I tell them about the others who have preceded them , so that , through them , they may learn to know me  --  and then , too , they form an angelic fraternity  --  a kind of angel-crown swirling about me , I like to think in my more poetic moments . " The tape-measure hypnotized me . He kept winding it about his neck , his stomach , he tossed it toward his feet , brought it back , draped it about his shoulders , and he continued to talk , the bulging eyes staring  --  his voice tumbling on and on , piling words on words , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now the rules , " he says . " Yes , there are always rules : Let me tell you , first , what I  --  uh  --  Like  --  To  --  Do  --  and what we will do at the last of each interview . " He giggled coyly , like a young embarrassed girl . " Come here , dear child . 1 mustI. 68 JOHN RECHYwhisper it to you  --  not because Im ashamed but because it is so Dear to me that I must keep it close to me by whispering  --  " I got up from the chair and stood next to the bed . He whispered in my ear , his rubbery lips brushing it . " I like to  --  " He studied my expression as he said it . " And do you know why ? Because  --  " He puckered his lips again . "  --  because it is : So Nice ! ... And so you see I ask for very little of My Angels . " I sat back down again . " Now to get to know you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthplace . Im good at this . You do nt talk like an Easterner . Now where would it be likely you would have been raised ? Your descent first ? " he asked me .... " Oh , yes . . . . The Southwest ! Thats it ! . . . Texas ! " And then he blurted the name of the city where I was born . I was tempted to say no , he was so smug , he had embarked on his game with such cocksureness . Lying there like an enormous doll , he almost appears to me like what God would look like . I nodded , yes . " You see , " he went on with childish pride , " I told you I would guess . Now your age  --  " He guessed that too . " Your weight  --  " He was almost exactly right . " Your height  --  " He hit it . " Now the physical dimensions are over , " he went on . " Except for one . Let me see your hand  --  no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger down as far as it will go . Mark it with another finger . Thats it . Now raise the middle finger and show me . . . . Fine . . . . A whore taught me that trick , and it is almost one hundred per cent accurate ... . And now , " he said , " I want to tell you about the angels .... But first a word about myself . I am a Professor , child  --  I am one of that fading breed that belongs to the school of thinking . ( And let inc add here , parenthetically , that for all I know you are a Brilliant Angel -- 1 never take anything for granted when it comes to that  --  but then again you might be a  --  what ?  --  a native angel , " he said tactfully , " who knows only what he needs to know . And I have periods for all kinds , and ( luring our interviews I shall discover what kind of angel you are . ) But I was telling you about myself : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , variously , other appointments . I went to Yale . . . . And from there  --  where ?  --  oh , yes , Mexico ! I spent a great deal of time there . I met the most adorable people , and it was the famous painter Alfredo Sanchez who gave me the nickname that all myCity of Night 69angels have called me in fondness at one time or another : The nickname is  --  " It sounded like " Tante Goulu . " " It is the name of a fictional madam , " he continues , " or , as you might say , the head whore of a House , ha , ha . And she was a bundle of love  --  like me . Ah , love . I have been in love many times  --  but let me tell you , without canceling out the possibility ( oh , the infinite possibilities ! ) of something Magnificent between us ( I am quite loyal ) , that throughout my life there has been but one Great Love : Robbie . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Oh , Robbie , Robbie ! Forgive me : Your place is taken by the hundreds of angels who drift into my life . " He . invokes someone beyond the room . ) " Anyway , child , I am a P-H-D  --  that is , a doctor , child  --  a Doctor of Learning : I do nt cut up people ; I dig into their minds to find , perhaps , a latent jewel ! Like a deep-sea diver , I stand breathless before the unopened oyster ! . . . And Alfredo ( you see , I spent some time in Mexico , as I have told you , with the American embassy )  --  and , oh , yes , I must tell you about the actress Lola del Rey : a Magnificent woman  --  the most beautiful in the world  --  . . . . I must explain that although my preference is for youngmen  --  as you may  --  have  --  gathered , " he laughed , " I can still admire beauty even in the other , less fair sex . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I must also tell you about the mistress of the President , at the time  --  oh , it was a scandal !  --  she was a movie actress , and then his wife  --  oh , later ! ... Now I must hear all about you . " He repeated the facts of my age , weight , height . " And then , of course  --  " He indicated on his palm what he had previously determined on mine . Then he went on : " There are three chief categories of angels  --  though their areas are sometimes not so well defined : earthbound , seafaring , ethereal . . . . The first , child , are the truckdrivers , the marines . One of my finest loves was an All-American . The day he learned he 'd been chosen , he came to me , he was my student , and he said : ' Tante Goulu , I want you to be the first to know . ' He autographed a football for me . I detested football , but I adored him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be on The Team  --  I helped him along , with his grades  --  Why , had it not been for my fondness for him , the world might have been deprived of one of its  --  What was he now ? Oh , yes , a tackle ! The world would have been deprived of one of its great tackles ! 70 JOHN RECHY ... And the next category of angels is the seafaring : the sailors . I suppose perhaps they are the original angels . I would watch them in San Diego  --  one summer I spent at La Jolla  --  as they invaded our streets , descending , all white , as if just arrived from Heaven , scattering themselves among the rest of us , unworthy , mortals ! ... I knew one , once , a young sailor who stayed with me . He was a very small boy , like a golden child . Outside of his uniform , he would have been an ethereal angel . He was the boyfriend of a very famous writer  --  who later used one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . Shall I amuse you , child ? ( Our interviews must have comic relief : The porter must come humorously to the castle door to admit the murderer . ) ... Anyway , the writer asked the sailor : ' Where would you like to go tomorrow ? ' It was here in New York , on a weekend , and the charming golden angel answered : ' I would like to see the sunrise on Wall Street . ' And that became the title of the writer 's next book : The Sunrise on Wall Street . Anyway , this sailor , this child , this golden angel , came to live with me  --  he had an argument with the writer . I thought he was on leave  --  but it turned out he was : Absent . . . Without . . . Leave . And they came for him  --  two other angels with arm bands : SPs  --  Storm Patrols  --  Shore Patrols  --  Something Patrol . It broke my heart . And , later , Alfredo himself  --  who I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is similarly inclined  --  . . . . Not that I am ashamed of my own inclinations  --  not at all  --  but just as I would resent being thought heterosexual , so I must assume he would resent the opposite . . . . And I have had friends of all sexes ! My life has flung itself wide , Wide ; like a windshield wiper I have covered my allotted area , fully . . . . But perhaps that is a bad allusion : the windshield wiper being so slender ! . . . Alfredo told me later : ' ! ' ante Goulu , you let the emotions rule you . ' Yes , that is true . I can conceive of no more beautiful world than one ruled by the emotions  --  what . a lovely world ! One would not push through the subway , thinking one might crush someone lovely . Oh , it would be a lovely world  --  ruled by the positive emotions . But then , child , the world is All Wrong . You see , it is backwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we been brought up on the idea that God is evil ? Why , it would make the world completely good . But , alas , they insist God is good ( and ICity of Night 71am not talking about the God which is Love  --  I am talking about the Other One , the one they pray to ! )  --  and all around us , cruelty , hunger , perversity  --  oh , perversity ( like why was I run over by a weak old woman when  --  ? . . . but Ive already told you that story , and the time of our interviews is too precious to retrace our footsteps ) . Yes , all around us , evil  --  about which , perhaps , you might be able to tell me something . Larry met you on Times Square ; that is a world of its own . . . . Now , Larry  --  he is not an angel . " He made a face . " He serves another function : he brings meangels ; he is loyal . " With a shrug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had mentioned Times Square . Lately , I have been intrigued by street angels . Larry brings them to me , I interview them . One , a lovely child , fell asleep during our interviews . He thought I wouldnt notice it behind the sunglasses he wore  --  the dear child ! And I pretended not to . I kept on narrating my commentson life . It seemed fitting to lull him thus to sleep . . . . And so you must tell me all about Times Square , child , all , all . I want you to tell me all about yourself , too , I want to know you , I want to hear you tell me about your life . Was your childhood happy ? You see , these interviews are For You  --  and once I said this to a young Frenchman , who believed it  --  as I would have you  --  and wanted him  --  to believe it . But ! He believed it differently . He robbed me ! . . . You wont rob me , will you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have a doorman  --  ha , ha  --  and  --  thetelephone  --  is  --  within  --  my  --  reach . . . . Enough of that : It was merely a feeble attempt at humor , child . . . . And thinking of a doorman  --  his uniform only  --  I remember Robbie . I met him at a costume ball  --  it was a New Year , and Robbie was there : He was dressed in an elegant uniform  --  I do nt know what kind : It was definitely military : sword , gloves , boots to his hips .... Frankly , I do nt think it was anything definite , really  --  he had just improvisedit , the dear child . But he looked Magnificent ! Like a prince ! An Angel ! . . . Gold brocade . Purple coat . White tights . Ah ! So slender ! ... The only other person I have ever seen look quite as Elegant  --  in my long , long , spent life  --  is Lola  --  Lola del Rey : She is like a queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in exasperation : those insipid comedies , as if a goddesshad been cast as a maid ! It was blasphemy . . . . An outrage72 JOHN RECHYagainst Beauty is the only blasphemy . . . . But to pick up the thread of my story : I asked a friend of mine , Who is that magnificentyoungman in the white tights ? ' And he answered the magic name  --  Robbie ! My Angel !  --  my love  --  the first , really , of the Angels : The Angel . Robbie . . . . And that child with the face of purity  --  that child , I was to learn , was a call boy . . . . But I anticipate my story . There is still another category of angels : The Ethereal Angels  --  these are the artists , the poets , the dancers . ... Which will you be ? Ah , but we 'll find out later . . . . I knew an ice-skater , who glided across my heart as if it were ice  --  at first  --  at first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . I have a weak heart , child  --  at times I stop and listen to it , listen to its beating , I cling to that sound  --  can it be , I wonder at times , that it has stopped , and am I now suspended between life and death ?  --  but that would be impossiblebecause no such stage exists : Death is merely the absence of life , and all philosophy that goes further goes on superfluously . It must stop There . . . . So this ice-skater warmed later , but then , as is the way of angels , he flew away  --  skated away to someone he had met  --  through me  --  an investor in a bigger show . . . . So you see , Life  --  my life  --  is the delving into the mysteries of the heart : ' The heart is deceitful above all things . . . . Who can know it ? ' We can try ! Try , by sharing our mutual space of time together , to fuse the secrets  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must go on to explain why I think we should believe in an evil God . Why , the belief in a good God , child , is belied all around us , we do nt understand , we turn from Him  --  and so turn toward the opposite : Evil . How much more logical if we were taught that God is evil ? Life would not belie that . We would believe in Him , implicitly  --  and again , we would turn from Him  --  rebelling  --  but this time we would be turning toward Good , the opposite of the evil God , whose existence we couldnt possibly doubt .... Which leads me somehow to the conclusion , " he chuckled , " that God , like Hamlet , is a woman : She changes Ilcr makeup constantly , She primps , She flirts with us . In other words : She cant make up Her holy mind . . . . ( A severely inelegant form , I must add , of unGodlyHigh camp ! ) . . . . And , good , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the All-American .

" He snuffed out the cigarette he had been smoking , looked through the box by the bed , found the lavender one . Held it up toward me . " Now comes the time for the lavender , " he said . He lit it , inhaled it deeply , deeply , this time , placed it on the ashtray ; said : " Now , Angel , come here , stand near me  --  but first , lower the bed for Tante Goulu please . Thats it . Now come closer , you see I have great difficulty moving . There , thats nice , thats fine  --  stand a little this way  --  thats  --  just  --  fine . Youre a good boy , an angel ....

" Then to me : " Do you have a telephone where you can be reached ? " There was one in the hallway , but I said no . " A permanent address , then ? " he asked me . " Yes ? Marvelous . Please leave it with me , " he said , " and let me give you my number ( we must observe the rules of Society ) .... I will see you tomorrow , then  --  tomorrow at this time . Please , please come  --  I will look forward to it . I shall listen to my heart until you come . And you must listen to yours and not deprive Tante Goulu of your company . . . .

" The man in bed turned his bulging eyes toward me and smiled , the flesh spreading as if he were getting larger by the moment , as if the balloon shape was being inflated . " Child  --  do nt stand me up  --  I couldnt take it . Tomorrow  --  tomorrow  --  And remember  --  " He waved his fat hand in an airy benediction , his face rolling to one side like a stone , the tape-measure dropping toward the floor . He reached for it quickly , wound it securely about his hand .... " And remember , " he finished , " remember : God Is Love .... " 3I had been home only a few minutes that night when I received a telegram : ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THAT YOU COMMUNICATEWITH ME TOMORROW . I KNOW YOU WILL NOT DENY ME THIS HELP ASKED OF YOU IN ALL HUMILITY . I BANK UPON YOUR GOOD WILL AND THE SENSE OF SUPPORT THIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AS YOU CAN . REMEMBER G IS L. " Who is it from , sweetie ? " said Gene de Lancey , following me into the room . ( " I cant sleep , " she had explained in the hallway . " I just got ta have one little cigarette with you , lambie . " ) She peered at the telegram . " It 's from someone I just met , " I told her . I knew it would be a very long time now before I got to sleep . " Everyone 's so Lonesome , " Gene de Lancey sighed . Early the next morning I went for my second " interview " with the Professor . The malenurse opened the door . " The Professor is asleep right now , " he said , eyeing me coldly . " He had a very bad night . ... Youll have to wait out here , " he said . I was about to sit down when I heard the Professor 's voice from the half-opened door leading to his room . " Larry ? Larry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , goes to the room . He returned : " He s awake now ; go in . " I had expected , because of the urgency of the telegram , to find the Professor in a state of desperation . He wasnt : He lay smiling on the bed . " Ali , child , child , you did come . . . . No , I wasnt asleep  --  I had just adjusted my hearing aid  --  I do nt want to miss out on any of its fitful morning gossip ! ... I am Delighted you came . Not that I did nt expect you to show up . I can tell sincerityjust as I can guess weights , ages , heights  --  you see , I have not lived these sixty-odd years without learning something  --  and I must pass on to you some of the things I have learned of this ambiguous existence we call life . Now bring your chair and sit near me . " He reaches for a pastel cigarette  --  feels with theCity of Night 75other hand about his back , touching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Larry ! " And when the malenurse appeared , the Professor pleaded breathlessly : " Where is my tape-measure ? " I saw it lying on the floor , beside the bed . I picked it up and started to hand it to him . Before the Professor could take it , the malenurse snatched it from me , and gave it to him himself . " Ah , thank you , child , " the Professor says , to me , ignoring the malenurse , " you have saved- . . . My Life  --  and I will explain how  --  soon  --  during one of our future interviews  --  . . . You may go now , Larry , I have to interview this young  --  angel ! " Now he drapes the tape-measure familiarly about himself , and I notice the chubby fingers searching out a certain place on it . His eyes are nailed to it momentarily  --  he moves the red marker . " Ah1 " He held his fingers on the mark , as if he were praying a rosary ... . " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his jeweled watch , " we will hear all about you . " Again , as if reciting a litany , he repeated the statistics he had determined yesterdaylovingly . " And there remains one important thing to determine : What kind of angel are you ? That is the question . The anticipationof finding out is the thing , dear child . . . . The French actress , Odette , said to me once : Professor , you play at life as if it were a mystery novel , and you the detective . ' And I answered , ' If so , my dear , you have provided the all-important clue . ' ... I am a student of life , my child , and my subjects are the angels who fly into my life . . . . Notre vie est un voyage , dans l'hiver et dans la nuit ; nous cherchons notre passage Bans le ciel , oie rien ne luit , ' " he recites , glancing toward Heaven . " A chanson suisse : A dark voyage , through winter and night  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But let me contradict that : For me something does indeed shine : the wings of the angels  --  briefly , but clearly . Angels are all I see when I glance heavenward , and that is Enough . And I never know how I shall meet those angels  --  it was not always as it is now  --  when Larry chooses them for me . You see , I am bedridden . . . . Sometimes he brings me demiangels ; they last only one interview . But sometimesthere are jewels in the streets . . . . There was a lovely child , in Paris , a youngman who followed me out of the W.C.  --  and we played a game , all through St-Germain-des-Pres . I would stop , he would stop . He was almost barefoot , his shoes were badly76 JOHN RECHY City of Night 77ripped . Each time I stopped , he would look at his shoes , wistfully , glance at me , smile  --  oh , charming , charming . And when I stopped at a cafe and sat down , he stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move on : oh , the insolent arbitrariness ! And I protested , But that child is with me . ' And I invited him to sit with me . An earthangel . A streetangel . I bought him pairs of shoes ! And Paris , that magnificent city of statues , glowed for me as if lighted by heaven itself . Alas , he was a robbing angel , " he sighed , feeling absently for his wristwatch . " But what I had gotten from him ! Ah ! " He turned heavenward . " My friend , the playwright  --  " He mentioned a French writer . "  --  was fond of saying , ' We take when we must take , and we give when we must give . ' Oh , he was chic ! . . . Now about you . What is the appeal that the streets hold for you ? What do you look for ? And , mainly , what do you find ? The streets : where one can find a glorious child without shoes  --  or someone to buy them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Paris , another vivid angel : with his father and mother . He was perhaps sixteen ; he wore a tiny cross around his neck , and it fell on his chest , the shirt open almost to his lovely navel . And the mother and father saw me and said good day . They invited me to their drab home  --  too drab to house such an angel as their child  --  and so , understanding that , they let me have him : He lived with me  --  for a space of time , a glorious space of time . And for that glorious time , in gratitude , I saw that the father and mother had glorious wine on their table  --  daily ... . The mother looked like a witch , Oh , yes ! I believe in witches ! There is much in the occult , you know . How is it possible for our time to believe in the fairytale of God and not in the other dark powers ? Which is more difficult to believe ? I have seen witches , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... I knew a woman in California who practiced witchcraft : Her power was Awesome . ( She had a medium , a youngman . . . another affair ! ) . . . And when she discovered  --  brutally -- that people came to her as one goes to see a clever fraud  --  not really believing in her Powers  --  when she discovered that , she willed herself to death . Yes  --  she announced she would die , and she did : trying futilely to prove by dying what she realized suddenly she had not proved by living : that she believed what she said . . . . People  --  people  --  " he started almost painfully : " people  --  die  --  when they see lifeat last  --  without  --  Illusions  --  For some , it takes many , many years ; for others , much less . And so each of us commits suicide : when we will our own deaths : That is the only Death .. : . " He paused , studying the tape-measure . " But enough about the dark powers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . On to more pleasant things ! . . . A friend of mine  --  a director  --  said : ' You are a talent scout , Professor . ' And indeed , I always search out Talent , dear , dear , child  --  angel  --  uncategorized angel . ( Am I being unfaithful to you , Robbie ? Robbie ! Guard me , watch over me ! ) . . . After I met Robbie , at that party , I learned he was a call boy . In other days he would have been referred to as a court favorite . But our unbudging standards of morality impose certain ugly names : The only immorality is ' morality '  --  which has restricted us , shoved into the dark the most beautiful things that should glow in the light , not be stifled by darkwords , darklights , darkwhispers . Why is what I do Immoral , when it hurts no one ?  --  no one ! an expression of : . . . Love . . . . Yet this unreasoningworld ignores the true obscenities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty and sensitivity  --  vide , the sneaky machinations of our own storm troopers  --  the vice squad ! " He exhaled loudly after the impassioned asseveration ; went on : " Another youngman , Smitty , a charming young angel himself , had brought Robbie along to that party . That night , I went to the restroom , as one does in the course of an evening  --  and happily , miraculously , who followed me in ? It was Robbie . .. . That was during another one of my periods in New York . Things were not going too well  --  uh -- financially . ( I must explain : Im much better off now  --  much better  --  and whatever funds I have will be expended to finish my research into : The Lives of The Angels ! . . . But , then , that time in New York , it was sadly different . ) I was completing , on my own , a study on  --  of all things  --  the angels as they appear in literature : Blake , Milton , Dante . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Archangel . . . . And what is there about angels that has so fascinated me ? The fact , perhaps , that like birds they have wings : That , to paraphrase Pope : angels rush in where fools fear to tread . . . . They are the true rebels . . . . And am I exaggerating this world of winged fleeing creatures ? Remember it was such a creature who brought about The Fall : But God , Who had given them wings , was a78 JOHN RECHYjealous God . . . . He denied them the existence He had created for them : The Flight . Out of spite , He created Adam and Eve  --  and voyeur-like , in His aged impotence , He watched them ... . And it was that rebellious angel , now Satan , who won them over to his way  --  a rebellious life  --  who made them taste of the Tree of Truth , which God , in His petty omniscience , would deprive them of . . . . In each of my angels I find something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : they all have wings . It is their nature to fly away , leaving an emptiness  --  but a glowing emptiness !  --  in my heart . . . . At the house of Dona Mercedes , in Mexico ( she was a grand Spanish woman , with a bosom which expanded yearly , to house , I told her , her gigantic Heart )  --  at her house , where I stayed briefly , there was a charming houseboy . Very beautiful : and the blades of his back were like sproutingwings when he crouched . Dona Mercedes said : ' He looks more like a featherless bird to me . ' Of course she could not see with my Clarity . This was one of the fallen breed , who rebelled , but was caught , put in servitude .... My Robbie had established his own heaven in the admiring eyes of others . He was at the time one of Smitty 's boys  --  that is , Smitty was Robbie 's ' Madam '  --  or , should I call him , his ' Monsieur ' ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night , when he walked into the restroom after me , Robbie groped me !  --  yes ! he groped me ! Dear child , I said naively to him , What Are You Doing ? I would have suspected he was following Smitty 's instructions had he not groped me so  --  so Sincerely ! . . . Smitty , you might say , had risen from the ranks : from gas station attendant , in Los Angeles ; thats where he began  --  right in the station restroom . Then he became a bartender , a famous call boy ; acquired some other boys  --  five or six  --  which he sent out on assignments . Robbie was one of them ... . I met Smitty when a friend gave him to me , for a night , for a long-ago birthday . Smitty could have been my guardian angel , if sex had been tlhe only consideration . But he belonged to everyoneat the same time . . . . I asked my host : How much do these boys get ? Ile told me  --  $15.00 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there for a long while , unable to do anything , dreamily prolonging , I suppose , the anticipation of what $15.00 would get me : a taste of Heaven  --  promised  --  for that small sum . Less than I paid in Munich for that beer mug you see there : That beerCity of Night 79mug is me , it has no beauty , no wings  --  it is ugly , it can break . The shattered pieces will be remembered . . . . And Robbie made the first move  --  that enchanted night in bed . . . . We were together two brief hours ( much longer , he assured me , than he had ever spend with his other clients )  --  $7.50 an hour : and that is how I have arrived at that figure : You see , I told you , I am Loyal ! . . . I remember the American heiress stranded by her young lover at the train station in Frankfurt . And all she could say was : ' God damn ! ' A more fitting eulogy would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is gone . And she should have remembered that wings that can take away can also bring  --  and so I said to her , as she looked one last frantic time about the station , ' Look around , this is a world of angels . ' ... " Now the malenurse entered with a tray . " Youve fixed a tray for my guest , of course ? " the Professor asked him . " I did nt know he 'd be here , " said the malenurse . He left , returned with a tray for me . " Larry is not an angel , " the Professor said again . " There is even , wouldnt you say ? something Uncomfortable about him . I distrust him sometimes . Do you suppose  --  " he asked , lowering his voice , "  --  that Larry is a misplaced agent for the FBI  --  in the wrong cell ? " He laughed , pleased with himself . " Perhaps , " he whispered in posed secrecy , " he is writing a book about me  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been between covers ! " He proceeded to eat , talking between mouthfuls . When he had finished , he placed the tray on the table . " We have talked enough , " he said . " Come over here , uncategorized angel . Stand next to me now . We have looked into the Soul long enough for today  --  now : Now let us look in the other , equally sacred , direction .... " Later as I walked out the door of his bedroom , I heard him call after me : " God Is Love .... " Ir the outside room , the malenurse sat reading a thick book . He rose , walking swiftly toward me as if I would escape . Ile thrust the book at me : " The Professor wrote this ! " he said . " He s written many great things ! " I reached for the book ; but before I could even read the title , he withdrew it from mc , not allowing me to touch it . " Heres the check , " he said. 80 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : VITAL UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE TO THE CONTRARYTHAT YOU MAINTAIN DAILY CONTACT WITH ME . I NEED THIS CONTACT VERY BADLY NOW FOR THE REASSURANCE IT GIVES ME IN MOMENTS OF VARIOUS CONFUSIONS AND DANGERS TO MY PEACE OF MIND . CAN EXPLAIN ALL WHEN YOU COME TO SEE ME . G IS L.When I saw the Professor , again there was no mention of the telegram . The tape-measure was on the bed . . . . The " interview " proceeded : the mountainous anarchy of the facts of his life piling higher and higher . Occasionally , I stopped listening , the drumming of his voice lulling me . There were episodes begun , interrupted , picked up , sometimes not finished  --  the story of Robbie winding through it like a wayward river . " I spent that first delirious night with Robbie , " the Professor was saying , " and it was Glorious ! He knew his calling  --  unlike  --  " he says , looking at me accusingly , "  --  unlike others who merely play at this life . And I would say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me , " yes , I would say : You sit and listen to me , you stand and let me at the end of our interview  --  but you do nt really Give . ' . . . There are painters who paint without heart , poets who write without compassion  --  they are cold . " ! ' here is too much coldness in this world : Alas ! the Ice Age of the heart has not left us . Here and there , a flicker of compassion arises courageously to thaw out the icy blanket  --  but it is just that : a valiant flicker , soon snuffed out by the very ice it sought to melt ! . . . Smitty gave his body , in any fashion at all , without question , without terms : His profession was to please , and one got what one paid for . Robbie gave his body and his soul . . . . Ile was like a saint who gives himself completelyfor his cause hat first night , " he said , the accusing gaze relenting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the $15.00 , and then , when he was already outside , I called him back . I gave him $10.00 more  --  all I had . And my friend , the author , Martin St Dennis  --  the Notorious American writer , child : an enfant  --  if now an aging enfant  --  terrible  --  . . . It got backCity of Night 81to him that I had given Robbie $25.00 , and Martin told me indignantly : Absolutely not , Professor ! You will ruin those boys ! Their fee is $15.00  --  not a cent more ! ' He couldnt understand what I had received from Robbie , my Robbie . But Martin is not a very perceptive person : His books are searchlights on the facts of our world  --  but cold , too , like searchlights . And where his heart should be , there is a novel . . . . I wish that were original but it is not : A psychiatrist said that to him once , who , incidentlyhowshall I say it and be modest ?  --  was intrigued by me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give me the Rorschach test  --  to test my subconscious !  --  and I let him  --  on a lark . I looked at one of the inkblots , and he said , What do you see ? ' I answered , I see you , trying to see me ! ' ... And that reminds me of a young assistant to the good Dr Kinsey . The assistant did nt fool me a second ; he was a professional voyeur . Do you know what that is , my dear young angel ? A watcher ! Science  --  oh , yes  --  truly  --  he was most dedicated to the science of Sexology ... . Countess von Braun was fond of saying : If Sex is a science , its only laboratory is the Bedroom ! ' . . . I introduced the young assistant to two charming youngmen I knew ( one of them gained a certain notoriety by playing the naked sailor in the musical Island Paradise ) , and the assistant Expressed An Interest in seeingone of their wild parties '  --  for The Research . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well ! These boys were not that kind  --  they were very quiet lovers  --  and I do not mean any trace of contempt when I say that kind '  --  it is a most extraordinary kind , that kind . Anyway , the assistant was so insistent ( The Insistent Assistant ! ) that they decided to stage ' a wild party for him . And they did . It was incredible ! The good assistant kept moving from room to room , watching  --  and , child , it was more than the glimmer of scientific discovery that shone in the good assistant 's eyes ! .. . He asked to interview me , for The Book , but I told him my affairs with the angels are too precious to reduce them to lines on a graph ! For example , how could he have indicated on a graph what Joe Jones ( it was part of his distinction that he had such a common name  --  at first )  --  what Joe Jones meant to me ? He was definitely an earthangel  --  and is there a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oklahoma cowboy , discovered on the range  --  who came to the newyork Rodeo ( I am not referring to the one82 JOHN RECHY City of Night 83in Madison Square Garden : Im referring to the Rodeo of this city itself ) , and whom I was able  --  my lucky star was shining  --  to corralin my own small patio  --  sadly not large enough for him who was used to The Plains  --  but briefly , briefly , I had that earthangel , but the bronco god called him , and off he galloped : to the vaster plains of Broadway  --  and I heard later he changed his name to Cam Rider  --  rather , the agent who Sponsored him changed it ; the agent was fond of saying : ' He jes cam ' ridin into my life . ' .. . How could the good assistant , with all his science , have indicated Cam Rider , rte Joe Jones , on his graph ? Impossible ! . . . And at the party which these two youngmen gave to entertain the assistant ( although he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always Material ! Research ! Study ! Science ! )  --  at that party , he would ask for specific performances . I must say the boys in the group had never had such a marvelous time  --  with no fear of a raid , since the assistant was well protected : And thus , in the future , you will see life imitating science ! . . . It was after Robbie had left that I went to that party . I saw Robbie after that magic first night , at different places , but I could not afford him . Once I had given him $25.00 , I couldnt give him less . I wasnt  --  let me again remind you  --  doing well  --  uh  --  ' breadwise , ' then : It was a dry period : And I thought that Heaven had allowed me only that brief time with Robbie . And then one day he called me : My Robbie ! ' Professor , ' he said , ' can I come up ? ' My heart died to speak the next words : ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford you at the moment  --  in fact , the memory of you is so precious to me , that I can not even afford that  --  but it is one of those rare prizes of life that memories have no price ! ' And then , after a brief wordless interlude in which my heart refused to budge , my guardian Angel sighed into the telephone : ' Professor , havens you ever heard of love ? ' . . . I had never dared to hope  --  me , a mountain of spent flesh  --  and that supple magnificentyoungman . ... And yet there it was : The Word : The Magic Word : Love . . . . I called up a friend of mine  --  for once , I was not too proud . I needed money badly , I told him . That afternoon , when Robbie came over , I gave him $100.00 . He looked hurt when I gave it to him . ' This was for love , ' he told me . ' Child , ' I told him , ' Robbie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my Love . ' And I pressed it into hishand . . . . Ah ! if indeed it were possible to shatter this sorry scheme of things  --  I would begin by replacing that first sharp slap which brings us howling into life  --  I would replace it .. . with a Kiss . . . . I would breathe Love into each child . . . . But my Robbie 's wings began to feel for the breeze , wings are meant for flying , and before I knew it he was Gone . He wrote me , he was in Europe  --  stranded briefly . I sent him funds . Then it was South America . By then things were much better for me , and I sent him money  --  a long-distance bond between us  --  but what I sent was but a meager expression of my Love  --  but what else could I do ? And always he would write back , endearingly , endearingly !  --  the dear child  --  that he should send it right back to me , but he needed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had from me was Greater . But he knew it pleased me to give him things . . . . And then , suddenly , no more letters  --  " He broke off abruptly , reached for a Kleenex , touched his cheeks . " Can I accuse him for the emptiness he left in my heart ? No ! It was his nature  --  the very nature which made me love him  --  his nature , to occupy my heart forever and my life only fleetingly : He had wings ; he had to fly away . . . . Or perhaps , " he said cautiously , almost in a whisper , " could it be that Love had indeed touched him powerfully  --  Love for me  --  and that that Love , at war with his angel 's love of flight  --  had  --  lost out ? . . . I do nt know . " He went on dully now : " I have heard he s now in Los Angeles  --  Im not sure  --  Ive heard he works in a bar  --  ... It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has soared to Heaven to bring Beauty to that drab place .... " He paused  --  a rare , long pause . Then , with a flourish of his cigarette , he continued more enthusiastically : " The Countess Sabrisky once asked me if I believed in Heaven , and I answered : ' Of course I believe  --  I have had it on earth ! ' . . . I was referring to the angels  --  my angels  --  why , even Milton , the poet , in his epic poem , was on the side of the rebellious angels . He makes us sympathize with them against God : They are as heroic as American colonists rebelling against extra taxation ! . . . But listen to me , I have gone on and on , and I must interview you , my new angel . . . . And , child , there is a favor I have to ask you : I must have a photograph of you , to put in my Album . . . . I84 JOHN RECHYhave pictures of most of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that shelf  --  that album  --  please bring it to me .... " I rose from the chair , mesmerized by the words which came almost like an endless song . I saw an album . On top of the album was a book : a thick , important-looking volume  --  much like the one the malenurse had thrust at me that day , but a different color . I glanced at the author 's name . It was the Professor 's . I brought the album to him . " Now move over here . No , you can bring your chair this time . The other is for the closing moments of our Interview  --  ha , ha  --  our momentary close farewell . First we establish emotional contact , by speaking to each other , by telling each other , as we have been doing , about each other 's lives : And then : . . . sex , " he said bluntly , strangely flatly . He begins turning the pages of the album , holding it over so that both of us can look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of different youngmen : some are large , others almost frail  --  some goodlooking , some harsh . The Professor is saying : " This is my All-American angel . I still have his football  --  somewhere  --  " He glanced about the room . " I must get rid of that beer mug , " he said absently ; going on , showing me the picture of a squarefaced youngman : " When he got married , " the Professor explains , " I gave him the money for the wedding ring . lie insisted he would pay me back , but I refused : I said : ' Somehowthis will be our wedding ring . ' And he said to me , ' Tante Goulu , thats why I asked you for the money  --  and not someone else . ' " ( I looked at the large blank bulldog face in the picture . I wondered how much the ring had cost . ) . . . " And look here , this is the Oklahoma cowboy . If I had been able to , I would have bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he sighed . ( I saw a studiedly masculine face mounted on a long lean body  --  the smile on his face like a stamp . ) " And this  --  this is the Mexican child with shoulderblades like sprouting wings : He had never been inside the Hellas Artes . I Iis eyes were more brilliant than the theater ! He wanted to come to America , he would speak about it to me glowingly , and I would describe it to him equally glowingly : It was his dream . Would I bring him here ? Alas , he got into trouble with the police . " ( The face of the dark youngman had stared at the camera with an obviously forced anxiety to please . ) City of Night 85 " Here is the young French boy  --  and with him are his mother and father  --  they insisted on being photographed with the adorablechild . " ( The picture showed a tall starkly pompous older man and a fat goodhumored-looking woman . Between them was a very young , handsome boy , his shirt open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was draped proudly about the boy- ' s shoulders ; the other hand held a bottle of wine toward the camera . ) ... " This is for the last , " the Professor said , skipping a page , bringing the book to his chest momentarily ; goes on : " And this is the most poetic of my poetic angels  --  he wrote the Most Divine , sensitive poems  --  crystals !  --  I helped him to get a grant  --  not through any foundation , mind you , but part of mine : My life 's source at that time thus contributing to his . " ( The youngmanin the picture wore his hair poetically over his forehead ) " He was a beautiful poet  --  " the Professor sighed , " and when I told him I would help him , he told me , passionately , that he would dedicate his first volume to me . Ive wondered if it came out . . . . Danny , the ice-skater : He glided across my not-so-icy heart . . . . And this one !  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the photograph gleamed coldly as if chiseled out of ice . ) .. . There were other photographs  --  youngmen in Spain , France , Italy , Germany , Mexico , America . . . several sailors , servicemen , various youngmen in trunks : all staring at the world with a look strangely in common : a look which at first I thought was a coldness behind the smile and then realized must be a kind of muted despair , a franticness to get what the world had offered others and not extended readily to them ... . And now the Professor turns back to the page he had skipped . I knew whom the picture would be of : " This  --  Is  --  Robbie , " he announced . ( I saw a handsome youngman sitting on a foreign car , squinting at the sun , smiling widely as if someday he would own the world ; as if the world for him was a mirror . But even in the picture he seemed to resent the brightness of the sun , greater than his own . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hugging the album closely again , " the indefinable shape of love  --  to which , dear child , you must not deny my adding your photograph .... " ( I wondered suddenly if I would photograph with the same hard look . . . . I remember Mr King : " Pictures in a fuckedup album . " ) " Yes , 86 JOHN RECHY Love , indeed , " the Professor said , " which has many forms . Who loved the most ? I ? They ? Who was the taker , who the giver ? Who can tell ? Someday  --  at the last of my Research  --  I shall know .... Now , " he said , " take away the chair and come stand near me  --  please .... " I placed the album under the heavy book with the Professor 's name on the cover . I could feel the bulging eyes on me as I lifted the book , slipped the album under it on the shelf . I went and stood by the bed . When I was ready to leave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me : " God Is Love ! " Outside , the malenurse stared frozenly at me. 5 The next day I received a third telegram : " NECESSARY " had become " VITAL , " and now " VITAL " was replaced by " UR- GENT . " The implied desperation of the telegrams , by now , did nt surprise me , and when I saw the Professor the next day , I ex- petted he would be as composed as I had left him . I was wrong . Now he seemed very tired . During the " interview " he reached incessantly for a glass of water , swallowed pills . I noticed that the red mark on the tape-measure had been discarded , or it had fallen oil ' . . . The words still tumbled on anarchically : He strung a necklace on which the beads were his love affairs : de- scribing them intimately . Suddenly  --  at the end of the interview , as I stood by the bed , his huge arms hugged me to him . The smooth rubbery flesh of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him away  --  moved back quickly . Front a distance of about two feet his great eyes stared at me , very long . ' ' Then , after many moments of such intense wordless relentless staring , he gasped at me : " Those papers !  --  under the album !  --  get them ! " Responding quickly to his sudden urgency , I brought the papers to him . He went through them feverishly , and then he brought out three closely printed sheets bound together . He flung them at me . " Read it if you can read ! " he shouted viciously . At the top of the sheet was his name  --  and then : " RESUME , " was printed beneath it : It listed his years at Yale , his many degrees  --  including honorary ones . " Read it all ! " he shouted at me ; he trembles . " Go on ! " . . . The list continued : foreign , service appointments , honorary titles , publications in scholarly reviews , foreign publications , books he had written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list and saw the man who had accomplishedall this : And the balloon face , pitiably tilted like a sad dog 's , is staring at me with something that could be only racking pain ... . " That is me , too ! " he shouts at me . " I am Respected , Admired , listened to , read !  --  but what do you care about that ? You see only the ridiculous man who made you stand by the bed with your pants down . But do you know the rest ? " The transformation was sudden and incredible . His great head was thrust forward toward me , almost beseechingly , like that of a great wounded animal , the eyes almost popping from his face behind the glasses . " The angels who drained my life ! " he said contemptuously . I watch his eyes in fascination , wondering if the tears that may emerge will be giant tears coming from the giant eyes in the giant face . " The angels ! The voracious angels ! " he shouts . " The ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never respected Me . Love ? Bought ! Bought for the prospect of a trip to America , a wedding ring which I would never wear , pairs of shoes and bottles of wine  --  bought ! Bought for $7.50 an hour ! Bought ! .. . for a hundred dollars . . . which was . . . cunningly . . . expected ... when the word . . . Love . . . was spoken .... " There were no tears , the eyes had already run dry . The malenurse rushes in . " Professor ! " he calls urgently , reaching for pills , water . The Professor continues sobbing . The malenursehugs him to him , closely , tenderly , sheltering him , rocking his head in his arms like a baby , soothing him  --  his lips kissing the shaved head . . . . The malenurse glares at me suddenly , eyes brimming with hatred . " What Did You Do To Him ? " He shoots the words at me like bullets . " Leave him alone , " the Professor sighs , freeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marches out . " Larry  --  " the Professor says , the sobs slowly subsiding , "  --  Larry is not  --  . . . an angel .... " And now , spent , he leans back in the propped-up bed . He reaches for a cigarette , shuffling through the box ; he finds a black gold-banded one , puts it into his mouth ; sighs calmly now : " Forgive me , child . My nerves . It 's lying here so long . I spoke rashly . We all do at times . I had no right to  --  ... And actually , " he said sadly , " actually I do nt  --  really like  --  . . . to kiss . . . . And after all  --  the terms  --  were made  --  at the beginning  --  of the interviews . . . . They were , in fact , made long , long ago . . . . Now , child , stand near me again , please . . . . Let me  --  let me  --  express  --  " He stopped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and me , he finishes : " Let me express  --  My Love ... . When he was through , he said : " God bless you , darling angel . Yes  --  " he sighed wearily "  --  God Bless All of You  --  . . . And me .... " He waved his fat hand in the familiar airy benediction , his eyes drooping . For the first time since I had known him , I see him remove the glasses now . The eyes look at me intently . The huge eyes behind the glasses were actually tiny ... . " Now go  --  " he sighed "  --  yes  --  fly away  --  join that endlessendless !  --  flightof angels .... " The eyes closed . His hand moves to the very tip of the tape-measure . I received no more telegrams . After a week , I telephoned the apartment , and the malenurse answered . " The Professor is dead , " he said . his voice was shaken ; controlling tears . " The interviews are over , " he said , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But before I could hear the inevitable sobs , he had hung up . CITY OF NIGHTND THEN THE DAY CAME IN NEW YORK when , standing on a street or in a park , I would see someone and wonder whether I had been with him  --  or just talked . . . one night . . . somewhere . Briefly , I went to Southampton with someone I had just met . I lay on the beach all day turning brown , trying in idleness to squelch the recurring panic , longing for something still vastly undefined . And briefly , with the same person , I went to Vermont , to a cool , cool summer interlude in a house set in the midst of the green mountains . As we drove back into the islandcity  --  into the jungle of knifegleamingbuildings  --  I knew suddenly I would n't stay much longer in New York . I would return to El Paso . And once again I got a job  --  determined that the money I would go home with would not be street money . I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had met her , as she had drifted out of the dark corridor of that enormousbuilding . Of all the faces that I would remember from that time in New York  --  hers , branded with years-long loneliness , was the only one that was around to say to me : " I hate to see you go . I 'll miss you , lambie-pie  --  much , much more than I can say ! " I walked west to the Greyhound station on 34th Street . I would leave this city unmissed except by Gene de Lancey , even my absence undiscovered . New people would replace me on Times Square and in the park . . . . As I remembered those short , short , short interludes with the streetpeople ( sometimes remembered with wryness , sometimes with huge sadness for something undis-90 JOHN RECHYcovered within them ) , would they also remember me ?  --  as someoneof a long line who had expelled , with them , momentarily , the loneliness : yet , ironically , increased it perhaps in the instantsfollowing the vagrant soon-to-recur contacts  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incompleteness intrinsic in sharing in another 's life . You touch those other lives , barely  --  however intimately it may be sexually  --  you may sense things roiling in them . Yet the climax in your immediate relationship with them is merely an interlude . Their lives will continue , youll merely step out . A series of encounters multiplying geometrically . . . . A prismatic network of . . . ( I remember the Professor , I see the tiny eyes behind the thick glasses ) " interviews . " Like mechanical dolls , people around me along the blocks proceed doggedly to their various morning destinations ; wait , mobbed , at the stoplights , restlessly pausing before rushing at each other , meeting in a melee in the middle of the street . They will brush shoulders , unaware , stumble , move on : each person enclosed by his own immediate world . Suddenly , unexplainably , I wanted to laugh . The grinding journey to  --  . . . Where ? In a few days , by the beginning of autumn , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my mother 's house , I saw her standing there waiting for me . She hugged me fiercely to her , and I glanced beyond her at the fragile case with the glass angels ... . Now there were steps to retrace . I called the girl I had climbed Cristo Rey with . Her father answered : She was gone ; married ; she had a baby ... . Alone , I returned to climb that mountain . Here , on holy clays , I had seen long processions of people from El Paso , Ysleta , Canutillo , Smeltertown , Juarez , as they marched up chanting devout prayers  --  kneeling at intervals , shawled ladies gripping rosaries . The priests leading the procession ; men carrying sadfaced saints . . . . Under the hot white sun , I had wanted to be . . . then . . . a part of that belief that transfixedthose faces as they climbed . And at the top of that mountain  --  now , years later  --  I wonderedsuddenly if emotionally I had really ever left this city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I could feel those very mountains which awesomely rim the city crushing me as in that childhood dream . But of course it was something else : the memories of that childhood which I had tried to bandage by fleeing the spurious innocence . Returning here again , I felt how easily I could regress to those early attitudes . The memory of the guarded isolation of that window ( in that house which we had vacated , that house where my dog had died ) drew me again to a craving for a powerful symbolic window away from the world . If I was to resist these lulling echoes , within this very city I had to usurp those memories ... . Once , years ago , El Paso had been a crossroads , between the Eastcoast and the Westcoast , for the stray fairies leaving other cities for whatever restless reason . As a young boy , crossing San Jacinto Plaza ( sleepy crocodiles in a round pond , then , so tired and sleepy they wouldnt even wake up when little kids grabbed them by their tails and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the giggling groups of birls camping with the soldiers . I had walked quickly past that park . . . . Now the inevitable smalltimecityroundup had come . The cops had swooped jealously on the fairies and to jail they went  --  and from jail : Away Again . Still , in this plaza , stray hunters turn up . But I couldnt remain there long . I went to a movie theater in South El Paso  --  resolved , that night , to slaughter those seducing memories in this way : The man followed me to the head , propositioned me there . I pretended I was a transient , reverting to the poses learned in New York . I told him I needed money . He agreed . In a parked car , in a dark section of this childhood city , I made it . Crushing into my pocket the ten-dollar bill he had given me : rather than feeling liberated as I had expected , I felt a scorching horrendous guilt . And I knew that no matter how long I would be in El Paso , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York to touch me here . The next day , with my mother , I went to the cemetery where my father was buried . There was only a tiny weather-faded92 JOHN RECHYmarker over his grave . Memories of his pride at having once been so widely recognized swarmed over me . ( And when he had died , as if the world had chosen belatedly to nod once more to him , his picture had appeared with the notice of his death on the front page of the newspaper , and my mother had received telegramsfrom as far as Mexico City . ) . . . But that tiny marker over his grave seemed to acknowledge what life had done to him . When we left the cemetery , we went across the street , and we chose a marble stone for his grave . A few days later , I returned to the cemetery , alone . The tiny marker had been replaced by the marble stone . Within that ground , his body had decayed . He lived only in my thoughts of him . I looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I had seen him alive . To a great extent , for me , it was all that was left of him . Now I drove around the city in my brother 's car , still retracing those early years . I stopped before the house where Winnie had died , where I had grown up . The porch no longer slanted . The skeleton vine was gone . The walls had been painted white . A dark shade was pulled over the window where I had looked out at the cactus garden , the street . . . my dead dog in the wind . . . . I tried from the sidewalk to look into the backyard . . . . My mother 's white sheets had hung on a line there , and I had watched her in unfocusedfascination . Those remembered clean , clean sheets in the Texas wind . . . . Now a new fence blocked my view . But without seeing it , I knew the yard had changed too . About that house there remained no trace of those angry years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely calm . The sun looks down blindly at me . Part Two " They 've been so long on lonely street They never will go back ....

Anywhere ! 96 JOHN RECHYAlong the coast , beaches stretch indifferently . You can rot here without feeling it . All that , I would see and realize later . Now it 's the Greyhound station in the midst of the Westcoast Times Square , the area about Los Angeles Street , Main Street , Spring , Broadway , Hill  --  between about 4th and 7th streets . ( From El Paso  --  knowing that my journey had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Again to the sexual anarchy . . . . In a period of about a month , I lived on East 16th Street , then 70th Street , finally Riverside Drive , in a oncemansionconverted now into rooms-for-rent : From a large window I could see the trees along the strip of park  --  the river gray beyond it  --  and as those trees turned bare , sighingly releasing their leaves , I knew New York for me had been exhausted . I must find another city . ) I walk along Main Street , Los Angeles , now . The jukeboxes blare their welcome . Dingy bars stretch along the blocks  --  threefeaturemoviehouses , burlesque joints , army and navy stores ; gray rooming houses squeezed tightly hotly protesting against each other ; colored lights along the street : arcades , magazine stores with hundreds of photographs for sale of chesty unattainable never-to-be-touched tempest-storm leggy women in black sheer underwear , hot shoeshine clipstands , counter restaurants . . . the air stagnant with the odor of onions and cheap greasy food . Instantly , I recognize the vagrant youngmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cowboys without horses , awol servicemen or on leave . . . . And I know that momentsafter arriving here , I have found an extension , in the warm if smoggy sun , of the world I had just left . As I stand on the corner of 6th and Main , a girlish Negro youngman with round eyes swishes up : " Honey , " she says  --  just like that and shrilly loudly , enormous gestures punctuating her words , " you look like you jest got into town . If you ai nt gottaplace , I got a real nice pad .... " I only stare at her . " Why , baby , " she says , " do nt you look so startled  --  this is L.A. !  --  and thank God for that ! Even queens like me got certain rights ! . . . Well , " she sighs , " I guess you wan na look around first . So I 'll jest give you my number . " She handed me a card , with her name , teleCityof Night 97phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call me  --  anytime ! " she said . And the spadequeen breezed away , turned back sharply catchingsight of another youngman , with a small suitcase . I heard her say just as loudly and shrilly : " Dear , you look like you jest got into town , and I  --  . . . " I turn the engraved card over , and on it there is written in ink : WELCOME TO LOS ANGELES ! I walk into a bar by the corner , next to the loan shop . I IARRY 'S BAR .... It 's a long bar with accusing mirrors lining its back . A canvas hanging across the ceiling from wall to wall makes the bar resemble an elongated circus tent . . . . Althoughit is early afternoon , there are many people here . I realize immediately that this is a malehustling bar . Behind the counter a gay young waiter flutters back and forth , all airy birdgestures . The scores sit eyeing the drifters who are stationed idly about the bar , by the jukebox , leaning against the booths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draft beer . The fluttering bartenderwinks . WELCOME ! his eyes beam . . . . Now the man next to me says : " You shouldnt be spending your money . " He slurs the words , he s very drunk . He pushes my money back toward me , replaces it with a dollarbill of his own on the counter . " Wottayadrinkin ? " he asks me . I change from draft to bourbon . He s a slender not-yet middle-aged man  --  well dressed  --  although in his juiced-up state , his clothes are slightly disheveled . He is not effeminate , but from the way he s looking at me calculatingly , I know he s a score . I sit there next to him for long minutes , and he does nt say anything . I begin to think he s lost interest . I go to the head , through the swinging door . The odor of urine and disinfectantchokes me . There are puddles of dirty water on the floor . Over the streaky urinal , crude obscene drawings , pleading messagesjump at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , appearance , size . Beneath the self-glorifying description , anotherhas added : " Yes , but are you of good family ? " Another scrawled note  --  a series : " Candy is a queen . " " No she isnt . " " Yes I am ....

I wasnt ; I said yes . " Wan na come with me ? " he said . We leave the bar  --  the bartender calls after us : " Have a good time ! " . . . Outside , we turn left , past the burlesque house with the fullblown tantalizing pictures of busty women . We enter the hotel next door . A ratty-looking man with a cigar barely glances at us , opens a splotchy old register book , we scribble phony names . " Three dollars , " the man behind the counter says . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He counts out three . The man behind the desk says : " That room 's open , you can lock it from the inside . " He does nt give us a key . . . . We go up the long grumbling stairway . Along the hall a door is half-open , a youngishman sat alone on a bed , in shorts , rubbing the inside of his thighs . We move along the maze of . . . lost . . . rooms , until we reach ours . Inside , the room is almost bare . For an ashtray theres a tin can . No towels . The walls are greasy , sweaty plaster peeling in horrendous childhood-nightmare lepershapes snapping at you  --  no window-screens . Paper curtains with ripped edges like saws hang dismally over the window : a room crushed in by the brief recurring lonesomeness that inhabits it throughout the days , the nights . The bed is slightly rumpled  --  as if only a hurried attempt had been made to straighten it after its previous occupancy . The man almost reels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wallet ; some bills flutter carelessly on the rumpled bed . I take them . He stuffs the other bills clumsily back into the wallet . " You gon na rob me , boy ? " he asks me suddenly . Then he grins drunkenly . " Hell , " he says , " Idon-givfuckhappens  --  happened  --  manytime . . . . Don-givfuck . " His look sobered momentarily . His eyes , which are incredibly deep , incrediblysad , look at me pleadingly . " Gon na rob me ? " Im thinking : Ile wants to be robbed , thats why he came up here with me , lies asking me to rob him . . . . I feel a sudden surge of excitement  --  as if lm being tested . He pushes the wallet loosely into his back pocket . After a few frantic moments during which I did nt even take off my clothes but merely lay in bed with him touching me , he sighed : " Whew ! "  --  closed his eyes . He turned over on his stomachCity of Night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost sliding out . With an excitement that was almost Sexual , I reach for it . It slips out easily . He did nt move . . . . I stand over the bed looking steadily e t him , very long , fixing the scene in my mind , experiencing the same exploding fusion of guilt and liberation I had felt that first time , with Mr King . I hear the man almost-sob : " Gon na rob me ? " The monotonous beat from the jukebox outside invades the room persistently . I replace the money I had just removed from his wallet . I lay the wallet  --  intact  --  beside him . And I walk out , past the unconcernedglance of the man at the desk . Outside , in the rancid air , I stand looking at the carnival street . Through the grayish haze of the smoggy afternoon , the sun shines warmly but feebly  --  the great myopic eye of Heaven .... Somehow  --  I knew  --  in that room just now  --  I had failed the world I had sought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I walk about the teeming park for the first time  --  past the statues of soldiers , one on each corner of the Hill Street side  --  past an ominous cannon on Olive , aimed defiantly at the slick wide-gleaming-windowed buildings across the streets : the banks , the travel agencies ( representations of The Other World , to which I will flee recurrently in guilt and feel just as guilty for having abandoned , if never completely , the world of the parks , the streets )  --  past the statue of Beethoven with a stick , turning his back fiercely on the Pershing Square menagerie . Throughout the park , preachers and prophets dash out Damnation ! in a disharmony of sounds  --  like phonographs gone mad : locked in a block-square sunny asylum among the flowers and the palmtrees , fountains gushing gaily : 011ie , all wiry white hair , punctuating his pronouncements with threats of a citizen 's arrest aimed at the hecklers . . . Holy Moses , his hair Christlike to his shoulders , singing soulfully . . . the bucktoothed spiritualsingingJenny Lu howling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seed The Light ( praise the Lord-uh ! ) on the frontporch to Hell ( holy holy Halleluj-uh ! ) , grinding , bumping at each uh ! in a frenzied kind of jazz ; and a Negro woman , sweating , quivers100 JOHN RECHYin coming-Lord-type ecstasy : " Lawd , Ahs dribben out da Debil ! Ah has cast him back to Hell ! Lawd , fill me wid Yuh Presence ! "  --  uh ! - ing in a long religious orgasm .... Gone preachers wailing receiving God : Saint Tex , who got The Word in Beaumont scorched one wined-up morning on the white horizon : BRING THE WORD TO SINNING CALIFORNIA ! ... And five young girls , all in white , the oldest about 16 , stand like white candles waxing in the sun , all white satin ( forgive my uncommitted sins ! ) , holding in turn a picture of Christ Crucified , and where the blood was coming , it was wax , which caught the light and shimmered like thick ketchup ; and the five white angelsisters stand while their old man preaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the cutest of the angelsisters , with paradoxically Alive freckles snapping orange in the sun , and alive red sparkling hair , is giggling in the warm Los Angeles smog afternoon among the palmtrees  --  but the oldest is quivering and wailing , and one day , oh , I think , the little angelsister will see theres nothing to giggle about , Truly  --  her old man having come across with the rough Message , and of course she 'll start to quiver and wail where once she smiled , freckles popping in the sun . . . . And an epileptic youngman thanks God for his infirmity  --  his ponderous , beloved Cross To Bear ... . Among the roses . And while the preachers dash out their damning messages , the winos storm Heaven on cheap wine ; hungry-eyed scores with money ( or merely with a place to offer the homeless youngmen they desire ) gather about the head hunting the malehustlers and wondering will they get robbed if  --  . . . Pickpockets station themselves strategically among the crowds as if listening in rapt attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " / " studhustlers " : the various names for the masculine young vagrants ) like flitting birds move restlessly about the parkfugitivehustlers looking for lonely fruits to score from , anythingfront the legendary $20-up to a pad at night and breakfast in the morning and whatever you can clinch or clip . . . . And the heat in their holy cop uniforms , holy because of the Almighty Stick and the Almightier Vagrancy Law ; the scattered junkies , the smalltime pushers , the teaheads , the sad panhandlers , the occasional lonely exiled nymphos haunting the entrance to theCity of Night 101men 's head ; more fruits with hungry eyes  --  the young ones searchingfor a mutual , unpaid-for partner ; the tough teenage girls making it with the lost hustlers . . . . And  --  but mostly later at night , youll find , when the shadows will shelter them  --  queens in colorful shirt-blouses  --  dressed as much like women as The Law allows that particular moment  --  will dish each other like jealous bitchy women , commenting on the desirability or otherwiseof the stray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And they giggle constantly in pretended happiness . And on the benches along the inside ledges , the pensioned old men and women sit serenely daily in the sun like retired judges separated now stoically from the world they once judged . . . . All !  --  all amid the incongruous music of the WelkianLombardianschool of corn , piped periodically from somewhere along the ledges ! All amid the flowers !  --  the twin fountains which will gush rainbowcolored verypretty at night . . . . The world of Lonely-Outcast America squeezed into Pershing Square , of the Cities of Terrible Night , downtown now trapped in the City of Lost Angels ... . And the trees hang over it all like some apathetic fate . MISS DESTINY : The Fabulous Wedding1THE FIRST TIME I SAW MISS DESTINY was of course in PershingSquare , on the cool , almost cold , moist evening of a warm smoggy day . Im sitting in the park with Chuck the cowboy on the railing facing 5th Street . " Oh oh , here comes Miss Destinee , " says Chuck , a cowboy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course very slow , with sideburns of course almost to his chin , and a giant tattoo on his arm that says : DEATH BEFORE DISHONOR . " Destinee 's last husband jes got busted pushing hard stuff , man , " Chuck is going on , " an she is hot for a new one , so watch out , man  --  but if you ain got a pad , you can always make it at Destinee 's  --  it 's like a gone mission , man ! " Indeed , indeed ! here comes Miss Destiny ! fluttering out of the shadows into the dimlights along the ledges like a giant firefly  --  flirting , calling out to everyone : " Hello , darling , I love you  --  I love you too , dear  --  so very much  --  ummmm ! " Kisses flung recklesslyinto the wind .... " What oh what did Chuck say to you , darling ? " to me , coming on breathlessly rushing words . " You must understand right here and now that Chuck still loves me , like all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or I would certainly have seen you before , and do you have a place to stay ?  --  I live on Spring Street and there is a ' Welcome !

And do nt let her scare you , clear  --  and Im sure you wont  --  why , Miss Lorelei  --  I mean , Sergeant Morgan  --  is as much a lady as I am : I saw her in the mensroom one time , and she ran everybody out  --  except this cute young boy  --  and  --  . . . " )  --  looking alternately coyly and coldly at Chuck then me seductively : all of which you will recognize as the queen 's technique to make you feel like such an irresistible so masculine so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than most real girls , queens being Uninhibited . Now Miss Destiny is a youngman possibly 20 but quite as possibly18 and very probably 25 , with false I.D . like everyone else if she is underage : a slim young queen with masses and masses of curly red hair ( which she fondly calls her " hair " ) , oh , and it tumblesgaily over a pale skinny face almost smothering it at times . Unpredictably occasionally she comes on with crazy Southern sounds cultivated , you will learn , all the way from northern Pennsylvania . " Oh my dear ! " she exclaims now , fluffing out her " hair , " " here I am talking all about my Sex life , and we have not been Properly Introduced ! . . . Im Miss Destiny , dear  --  and let me hasten to tell you before you hear it wrong from othuh sources that I am famous even in Los gay Angeles  --  why , I went to this straight party in High Drag ( and I mean High , honey  --  gown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and  --  " " An you know who she was dancing with ?

" " Masquerading , dear . . . . But how was I to know the repressedqueer was the vice squad  --  tell me ? . . . " And she goes onbreathlessly conjuring up the Extravagant Scene ... . ( Oh shes dancing like Cinderella at the magic ball in this Other World shes longingly invading , and her prince-charming turns out to be : the vice squad . And oh Miss Destiny gathers her skirts and tries to run like in the fairytale , but the vice grabs her roughly and off she goes in a very real coach to the glasshouse , the feathers trembling now nervously . Miss Destiny insists she is a real woman leave her alone . ( But oh , oh ! how can she hide That Thing between his legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ? ) . . . All lonesome tears and Humiliation , Miss Destiny ends up in the sex tank : a wayward Cinderella .... ) " Now , honey , " she says with real indignation , " I can see them bustin me for Impersonating a man  --  but a woman !  --  really ! ... " And you will notice that Miss Destiny like all the other swinging queens in the world considers herself every bit a Lady . " But nevuh mind , " she went on , " I learned things in the countyfawm I did nt know before  --  like how to make eyeshadow out of spit and bluejeans  --  and oh my dear the kites I flew !  --  I mean to say , no one can say I did nt send my share of invitations out ! . . .

Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have him on the couch !  --  but now  --  " turning her attention to me fullblast , because , you will understand , Miss Destiny scouts at night among the drifting youngmen , and at the same time you can tell shes out to bug Chuck : and when she asked me would I go to the flix with her now ( " across the street , where it is Divine but you mustnt be seen there too often , " she explains , " because they will think youre free trade  --  . . . " ) , Chuck said : " It would not do you no good , Destinee , they will not let you in the men 's head . " " Miss Destiny , Mister Chuck , " she corrects him airily . And went on : " Did nt I tell you all my exhusbands are jealous of me ? Chuck lived with me , dear , " she explains , " as just about every other studhustler has at one time or another , I must add modestly . But , baby , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stormy , dear ) . Why , I just couldnt drag Chuck from the window  --  he  --  " " Oh , man , " interrupts Chuck . " Next to Miss Destinee 's pad theres this real swell cunt an she walks aroun all day in her brassiere  --  standin by the window , an she  --  " " But I fixed that ! " Miss Destiny says triumphantly . " I nailed the damn windowshades so no one can look out at that cunt anymore ! . . . Oh ! " she sighed , her hand at her forehead , " those days were trying days . Chuck 's a good hustler  --  but he s too lazy even to try to score sometimes . And , honey , my unemployment check went just so far : You see , I took a job just long enough to qualify for unemployment , and then I turned up all madeup and they let me go  --  and everytime they call me up for a job , why I turn up in drag and they wont have me ! ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Destiny  --  as she rushes on now about the Turbulent Times  --  I know the scene : Chuck the masculinecowboy and Miss Destiny the femme queen : making it from day to park to bar to day like all the others in that ratty world of downtown L.A. which I will make my own : the world of queens and malehustlers and what they thrive on , the queens being technically men but no one thinks of them that way  --  always " she "  --  their " husbands " being the masculine vagrants  --  fleetingly and often out of convenience sharing the queens ' pads  --  never considering theyre involved with another man ( the queen ) , and as long as the hustler goes only with queens  --  and with other men only for scoring ( which is making or taking sexmoney , getting a meal , making a pad )  --  he is himself not considered " queer "  --  he remains , in the vocabulary of that world , " trade . " " Yes , " Miss Destiny is going on , " those were stormy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , God bless him , Chuck believes every Big story : like when Pauline told him she 'd really set him up  --  " " Man , " Chuck explained , laughing , " Pauline is this queen thats got more bull than Texas !

But nevuhmind , let him be gullible ( thats someone who believes untrue stories ) . And , besides , " she says with a toss of her head , " I flipped over Sandy , a106 JOHN RECHYbad new stud . . . . But Chuck 's still jealous of me  --  he knows Im looking for a new husband  --  now that poor Sandy ( my most recent ex , dear ) got busted , and I know he did nt have any hard narcotics on him like they say he did  --  they planted them in his car  --  . . .

The quality of muhcee is mighty strained indeed  --  as the dear Portia said ( from Shakespeare , my dears  --  a very Great writer who wrote ladies ' roles for dragqueens in his time ) . And it breaks my heart to think of my poor Sandy in the joint away from women all that time , him so redhot he might turn queer , but oh no not my Sandy , he s all stud . If I know him , he 'll come out of the joint rich , hustling the guards . . . . And I tried to be faithful  --  but the years will be so long  --  and what can a girl do , and restless the way I am ?  --  restless and crying muhself to sleep night aftuh night , missing him  --  missing him . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On  --  he would want it that way . Well , queens have died eaten by the ah worm of ah love , as the Lovely Cleopatra said  --  she was The Queen of Ancient Egypt  --  " ( quoting , misquoting Shakespeare  --  saying it was a lovely he-roine who said it in the play  --  taking it for granted  --  a safe assumption in her world  --  that no one will understand her anyway ) . " Then Miss Thing said to me ( Miss Thing is a fairy perched on my back like some people have a monkey or a conscience ) , " she explained , " well , Miss Thing said to me , ' Miss Destiny dear , do nt be a fool , fix your lovely hair and find you a new husband  --  make it permanent this time by really getting Married  --  and even if you have to stretch your unemployment , do nt allow him to push or hustle ' ( which breaks up a marriage )  --  and Miss Thing said , ' Miss Destiny dear , have a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding , " Miss Destiny sighed wistfully , " Like every young girl should have at least once . . . . And when it happens oh it will be the most simpuhlee Fabulous wedding the Westcoast has evuh seen ! with oh the most beautiful queens as bridesmaids ! and the handsomest studs as ushers ! ( and you will absolutely have to remove those boots , Chuck )  --  and Me ! .. .

And there will be champagne ! cake ! a real priest to puhfawn the Ceremony !  --  " She broke off abruptly , shutting her eyes deliriously as if to visualize the scene better . Then she opened them again , onto the frantic teeming world of Pershing Square ... . " They will bust you again for sure if you have that wedding , Miss Destinee , " said Chuck gravely . " It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , it would be worth it . " Then we noticed a welldressed man standing a few feet from us in the shadows , staring at us intently until he saw us looking back and he shifted his gaze , began to smoke , looked up furtively again . Miss Destiny smiled brightly at him , but he did nt smile back at her , and Miss Destiny said obviously he is a queer and so he must want a man . " So darlings , I will leave you to him and him to whomevuh eenie-meenie-miney he wants . But let me tell you , my dear  --  " me  --  confidentially "  --  that when they dress that elegantly around here , why , they will make all kinds of promises and give you oh two bucks , " and Chuck said oh no the score was worth at least twenty , and Miss Destiny laughs like Tallulah Bankhead , who is the Idol of all queens , and says in a husky voice , " Dalling , this is not your young inexperienced sistuh you are talkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a-round ... . Why , Miss Thing told me about this sweet stud kid going for a dollar !  --  . . . Ah , well , as my beloved sweet Juliet said , Parting is : such  --  sweet  --  sorrow  --  ... " And she sighed now , being Juliet , then whispered to me loud enough for Chuck to hear , " There will be other times , my dear  --  when you are not Working . " And she moved away with peals of queenly laughter , flirting again , fluttering again , flamboyantly swishing , just as she had come on , saying hello to everyone : " Good evening , Miss Saint Moses , dear  --  . . . " spreading love , throwing kisses , bringing her delicate hands to her face , sighing , " Too Much ! " after some goodlooking youngman she digs , glancing back at Chuck and me as the man moved out of the shadows , closer to us , jingling money. 108 JOHN RECHYSo there goes Miss Destiny leaving Pershing Square , all gayety , all happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear , ummmm , so much .... " 2Those first days in Los Angeles , I was newly dazzled by the world into which my compulsive journey through submerged lives had led me  --  newly hypnotized by the life of the streets . I had rented a room in a hotel on Hope Street  --  on the fringes of that world but still outside of it ( in order always to have a place where I could be completely alone when I must be ) . Thus the duality of my existence was marked by a definite boundary : Pershing Square : east of there when the desire to be with people churned within me ; west of there to the hotel when I had to be alone .... At times , after having combed the bars , the streets , the park , I would flee as if for protection to that hotel room . Yet other times I needed people fiercely  --  needed the anarchy of the streets ... . And Main Street in Los Angeles is such an anarchy . This is clip street , hustle street  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls ; smoking , peering anxiously to spot the bulls before they spot you ; the rushing in and out of Wally 's and Harry 's : long crowded malehustling bars . And here too are the fairyqueens  --  the queens from Everywhere , America  --  the queenly exiles looking for new " husbands " restlessly among the vagrant hustlers with no place to stay , and the hustlers will often clip the queens ( if there is anything to clip ) , and the queens will go on looking for their own legendary permanent " Daddies " among the older men who dig the queens ' special brand of gone sexplay , seldom finding those permanent connections , and living in Main and Spring Street holes : sometimesmaking it ( employed and unemployed , taking their daddies and being taken by the hustlers )  --  sometimes hardly , sometimes not at all . And the malehustlers live with them off and on , making it from bar to lonesome room , bragging about the $50 score with the fruit from Bel Air who has two swimming pools , jack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did nt show , you do nt say that ) , and youre clinching a dime and a nickel for draft beerCity of Night 109at Wally 's or Harry 's or the 1-2-3 or Ji-Ji 's so you can go inside and score early , and make it with one of the vagrant young girls to prove to yourself youre still All Right . And so Main Street is an anarchy where the only rule is Make It ! . . . And the only reminders of the world beyond its boundaries are the policewagons that cruise the streets  --  the cops that pick you at random out of Hooper 's all-night coffee shop after 2:00 in the morning . . . . The free jammed ride to the glasshouse for fingerprints .. . Rock-n-roll sounds fill the rancid air . This was the world I joined . A couple of blocks away from Main Street , on Springsquashedon either side by gray apartment buildings ( walls greasy from days of cheap cooking , cobwebbed lightbulbs feebly hiding in opaque darkness , windowscreens if any smooth as velvet with grime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  just beyond the hobo cafeteria where panhandlers hang dismally outside in the cruel neonlight ( fugitives from the owlfaces of the Salvation Army fighting Evil with no help from God or the cops ; fugitives from Uplifting missionwords and lambstew )  --  isthe 1-2-3 . Outside , a cluster of pushers gather like nervous caged monkeys , openly offering pills and maryjane thrills , and you see them scurrying antlike to consult with Dad-o , the Negro king of downtown smalltime pushers  --  and Dad-o , sitting royally at the bar like a heap of very black shiny dough , says yes or no arbitrarily . And that is the way it is . I saw Miss Destiny again one Saturday night at the 1-2-3 . And that is when it swings . " Oooee ... " she squealed . " I wondered where you were , baby , and I have thought about you  --  and thought , why he s gone already  --  Escaped !  --  andoh Im so glad youre not , and come here , I want you to meet my dear sistuhs and their boyfriends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hustlers who are Miss Destiny 's friends . And squeezing expertly through the thick crowd , Miss Destiny1 1 0 JOHN RECHY City of Night 1 11led me into a cavern of trapped exiles  --  of painted sallowfacedyoungmen , artificial manikin faces like masks ; of toughlookingmasculine hustlers , young fugitives from everywhere and everything , young lean faces already proclaiming Doom ; of jaded old and middle-aged men seeking the former and all-aged homosexuals seeking the latter  --  all crowded into this long narrow , ugly bar , plaster crumbling in chunks as if it had gnawed its own way into the wall ; long benches behind the tables , splintered , decaying ; mirrors streaked yellow  --  a bar without visible windows ; cigarette smoke tinged occasionally with the unmistakableodor of maryjane hovering over us almost unmoving like an ominous hand . . . . And the faces emerge from the thick smoke like in those dark moody photographs which give you die feeling that the subjects have been imprisoned by the camera . " This is Trudi , " Miss Destiny was saying , and Trudi is probably the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be completely queer not to dig her . Her hair is long enough for a woman , short enough for a man . Her eyelashes were painted arched over round blue coquettish eyes , and of all the queens I will meet in L.A. , Trudi has most accurately been able to duplicate the female stance so that , unlike most other queens , she has not become the mere parody of a woman . " Hi , baby , " she says , pursing her lips cutely , " welcome to the snakepit . " She indicates the scene about her as if she had been born to reign over it . " And this is Skipper , " Miss Destiny continues , and as if presentinghis credentials adds , in a lower tone for me only  --  and I can barely hear her over the blasting music : " He used to be a physique model , baby , and he became quite famous in Hollywoodonce  --  he s even hustled Officer Morgan  --  and that 's the truth  --  but he 'll tell you all about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the familiar scene ; almost  --  it seems at times  --  in bewilderment  --  as if looking around him each moment , he is newly aware of where he is . Often he squinted as if to cloud the scene from his mind . He is now  --  and it will turn out is usually  --  talking about a plan to hit the Bigtime again . " Hi , jack ! " he says , and his eyes rake the bar . . . . And all at once he does nt look nearly as young as he first appeared . " And my dear , Dear sistuh Lola  --  " Miss Destiny is saying ( queens calling each other sisters ) ; and Lola is quite possibly " dear , Dear " because undoubtedly shes the ugliest queen in the world , with painted eyes like a silent moviestar , and a black turtleneck sweater running into her coarse shiny black hair so that it seems shes wearing a hood  --  and has a husky meanman 's voice and looks like nothing but an ugly man in semidrag . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " And you have of course already met Mistuh Chuck , " Miss Destiny says sighingly , and Chuck tipped his wide hat in salutation : " Howdee . " " And this is Tiguh  --  " Miss Destiny went on . And Tiger ( names , you will notice , as obviously emphatically masculine as the queens ' are emphatically obviously feminine and for the same reason : to emphasize the roles they will play ) is a heavily tattooed youngman who has precisely that quality you sense in caged tigers glowering savagely through iron bars . " And Darling Dolly  --  " Miss Destiny said . And Darling Dolly corrects Miss Destiny : " Darling Dolly Dane , Destiny dear . " And Destiny corrects her : " Miss Destiny , Darling Dolly Dane , dear . " Truly , you will admit , Darling Dolly Dane is cute in the dimlight and smokeshadows , with softlooking creamskin and dancing eyes and a loose sweater tonight and slacks  --  acting like a flirt teenage girl out to get laid . " And Buddy  --  " Miss Destiny finishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , I would say 19  --  at whom , as Miss Destiny and I sit at the already-crowded table , Darling Dolly Dane is glaring . Miss Destiny tells me confidentially , to explain the cool looks between Darling Dolly and Buddy , that Buddy had been living with Darling Dolly Dane until last night when she found he hocked some of her drag clothes and she locked him out and he had to sleep in his brokendown Mercury , which may not even be his . . . . Now a score at the bar is ostentatiously turning us on to free drinks  --  and cokes for Darling Dolly , who is making such a thing about her Not Drinking . On a small balcony over the head , the rock-n-roll spades are going , perched like a nest of restless112 JOHN RECHYblackbirds . A queen , obviously drunk , has climbed on it and has started to do an imitation strip , and Ada , who runs the bar and is a real woman  --  a mean , tough blonde like a movie madam  --  climbs after her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unsnapping her imaginary brassiere , saying : " Ssssssssssssu fferrrrrrrrrrr ... . At the table , everyone is talking , eyes constantly searching the bar . The beat of the music somehow matches the movements , the stares , the muted desperation all around ; the smothered moans of the spade now blaring words from the balcony is like a compositemoan , a wail emanating in unison from everyone crushed into this dirty bar . . . . Darling Dolly is breathlessly explaining the Severe Jolt she got when she got home and found her best drag clothes gone : " My lovely lace negligee  --  my studded shoes ! " Buddy shakes his head and says to the table : " I needed the bread . " Darling Dolly stabs him with a look . Chuck says he s heard of a malehouse in Hollywood where he can make hundreds of dollars a day : " But I don know where it is so I cain apply . " Miss Destiny says , " Chuck , my dear , you are just too lazy to get ahead  --  remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " ... Trudi is wondering wheres her daddy , and Miss Destiny explainsto me that Trudi 's " daddy " is an old man whos been " keeping Trudi for ages  --  and keeps Skipper , too , sometimes  --  but indirectly " : Skipper living off and on with Trudi and hitting it big occasionally  --  " after being Really Big in Hollywood once "  --  and going away , coming back to Trudi 's . . . . Nearby , an emaciated man with devouring deep-buried eyes is pretending to read the titles on the jukebox , but it 's obvious that he is fascinatedlystudying Tiger 's tattoos  --  and Tiger , noticing this , glances at him with huge undisguised contempt , which sends the emaciated man into an ecstasy of sick smiles . Now the queens at the table are wondering aloud who the score buying the juice is digging : the queens or otherwise , and which one . And which does it turn out he s digging ? The queens . And which one ? Darling Dolly Dane . And when this became known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dolly skips over to him , perches on the stool next to him at the bar , and says , " Another tall cool Coca-Cola please , honey , and make itCity of Night 113straight . " Miss Destiny sighed , " Well , lordee , Tara is saved tonight . " Immediately Skipper had a plan to clip the score , and Trudi says philosophically , " Do nt get nervous , youll shake the beads "  --  ( the beads being life  --  fate  --  chance  --  anything )  --  " and besides , Darling Dolly saw him first . " Miss Destiny says theyre all Too Much . Suddenly shes becoming depressed  --  and the obvious reasonis that the score who it turned out dug queens did nt dig her . " Oh , Im really depressed now ! " Miss Destiny said . Someone had mentioned that Pauline had just walked in . I looked , and theres Pauline  --  a heavily painted queen who thinks she looks like Sophia Loren  --  with a collar like the wicked queen 's in Snow White . Miss Destiny said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . prosti-tute . " Trudi : " A cheap whore . " Lola , in her husky man 's voice and glowering nearsightedly : " A slut . " Trudi : " A common streetwalker . " Lola : " A chippy . " Miss Destiny  --  conclusively , viciously : " A cocksucker ! " Chuck gagged on his beer . " She ain got nothin on you , Destinee ! " Then quickly , diverting attention from Pauline and putting Chuck down with a look , Miss Destiny asked me abruptly do I know anyone in Hollywood who has a beautiful home with a beautiful Winding Staircase where she can come down  --  " to marry , " she explains , " my new husband and spend my life blissfully ( thats very happily , dear ) on unemployment with him forever . " Darling Dolly Dane returned suddenly very angrily lisping the man had offered her two bucks , after such a show of buying drinks . " And do you know what the sonuvabitch wants for two miserable goddam bucks ? " " To marry you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clip the score . " I do nt have my husband picked out yet , " Miss Destiny went on as if there had been no interruption . " That part isnt too importantyet  --  I 'll wait until I fall in love again ( do nt look at114 JOHN RECHY City of Night 115Pauline , shes looking over here )  --  the important thing now is the Winding Staircase . " Darling Dolly Dane : " Two miserable bucks ! " Lola : " Youve gone for less , dear . " Darling Dolly Dane , wiggling : " This ai nt no change-machine , Mae . " Chuck : " Hey , sweetie , you light up with a nickel ? " Skipper : " Darling Dolly , you go with the cholly , and I 'll cool it by the parking lot  --  " Tiger : " Stomp the shit out of him . " Trudi , sighing as if no one but she really understands : " My dears , I tell you it 's the goddam beads . " Buddy : " Darling Dolly , tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hock . " Miss Destiny sighs : " Oh ! this ! is ! too ! depressing !  --  really , my dears , you talk like common thieves and muggers  --  and what am I doing here ? . . . Now as I was saying  --  what ?  --  oh , yes  --  ... " Now the score  --  checking the looks and mean sounds  --  starts to leave , and Darling Dolly rushes after him , leaving Skipper plotting , and she whispers something to the score ( on tiptoes ; she is very short ) , and as they went out together , Buddy laughs and laughs : " Two bucks ! " And Lola said , " Youve gone for less , dear . " I promised Destiny to tell her if I met anyone with a beautiful home and a winding staircase . " Baby , " she said abruptly , unexpectedly moodily , " do nt you think I look real ? " And before anyone can answer , possibly afraid of the answer , she went on hurriedly , " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . " " Here it comes , clears , the goddam Miss Destiny beads , " said Trudi , recognizing Miss Destiny 's cue and looking over the crowd for her " daddy , " who is to meet her here tonight and take her  --  she says  --  to Chasen 's  --  Beverly Hills ' exclusive restaurant . And indeed , just like that , Miss Destiny  --  on  --  has begun to tell me about when she first came out and how she became Miss Destiny . Soon , Im the only one listening to her , the others moving away restlessly , having heard it or portions of it or a version of it : Trudi finds her " daddy "  --  a fat middle-aged manand Chuck goes to the bar and is now talking to a flashily dressed fruit in a redcheckered vest . Skipper is playing the shuffleboard , ramming the disk vengefully into the pins . . . . Wordlessly entranced , the emaciated man is standing next to Tiger where he s leaning against the peeling wall . Buddy has left the bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Lola is sitting alone at the bar , elbows propping her ugly face dejectedly . Lookingat her from the distance , I realized how much she looks like a lesbian . " Before I flipped , " Miss Destiny was saying , rushing , as if the hurried flow of her words would keep me with her , " I was very Innocent , " and I could sense the huge depression suddenly , perhapsthat one rejection just now echoing into the very depths of her consciousness setting off a thousand other rejections . " Of course , " she went on , " Miss Thing had told me , ' Why how ridiculous !  --  that petuh between your legs simpuhlee does not belong , dear . ' And oh , once , when I was a kid , I asked my father for paperdolls , and he brought me some Superman comicbooks instead  --  and then , oh ! I asked him for Superman paperdolls . ... And they were always so ashamed of me when I wanted to dress up  --  and my father threw me out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took my doll with me that I slept with since I was little  --  and I had to quit college ( where I studied Dramatics , dear , but not for long , because they wouldnt let me play the girl 's part ) , and I went to Philadelphia . And the first thing I did , why , I bought myself a flaming-red dress and highheeled sequined shoes and everyone thought I was Real , and Miss Thing said , ' Hurray , honey ! youve done it  --  stick to it , ' and I met a rich daddy , who thought I was Real , and he flipped over me and took me to a straight cocktail party .... " And so , with Eminent contradictions ( I must warn you ) , the wayward saga of Miss Destiny unfolds  --  that night at the 1-2-3 , in the ocean of searching faces : " Naturally , " she continued , " I got into the Finest circles . Philadelphia society and all that  --  and Im sippin muh cocktail at this party when in walks the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stares at me ! Walked away from the hostess  --  who was a real lady ( a society model , baby , and later she became a Moviestar and married that king  --  you know ) 116 JOHN RECHY City of Night 117  --  " muttering bitch after Pauline who just then passed brushing my shoulder purposely to bug Miss Destiny "  --  and this gorgeous youngman , why , he comes to me and says  --  just like that  --  ' You Are My Destiny ! ' and I thought he said , ' You are Miss Destiny , ' mistaking me you know for some other girl , and when the hostess says Im the most beautiful fish shes evuh seen , what is my name , Im terrified the gorgeous youngman will drop me if Im not who I think he thinks I am , so I say , ' I am Miss Destiny , ' and he thinks I said , ' I am his destiny ' ( he told me later ) , and he says , ' Yes oh yes she is , ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh they go home that night and Miss Destiny must confess she is not a real woman , but , oh , oh , he does nt care , having of course flipped over her , and he takes her to his country estate , his family naturally being Fabulously rich , and they simply Idolize Miss Destiny . . . . ) " His name was Duke , " Miss Destiny sighed , " and when I met him , oh I remember , they were playing La Varsouviana ( thats ' Put Your Little Foot , ' dear )  --  you see , although it was a cocktail party , it was so Elegant that they had an orchestra  --  and how I loved him , and I know thats a strange name  --  Duke  --  but it was his real name , not a nickname  --  but he would be a wild rose by any other name and smell as sweet ! . . . Being aristocrats , all his family had strange names : his mother 's name was ah Alexandria , just like the ah queen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mythology ( those are very old stories , dear )  --  " Suddenly here is Darling Dolly Dane back gasping tugging at Miss Destiny , who of course resents the intrusion in the middle of her autobiography . " Destiny , Destiny , quick , " Darling Dolly pleads , " Ive got to have the key to your pad right away quick hurry ! " I notice Darling Dolly is carrying a small bundle that looks suspiciously like a pair of pants . All right , all right  --  and what does Darling Dolly want the key for ? Darling Dolly Dane says she just clipped the score she went with who promised her the deuce , remember ? She told him do nt bother getting a room , give the extra bread to her , honey , and : " I know a swinging head in an apartment house right around here , " Darling Dolly told the score , who was pretty juiced anyhow . So they go up to the head , and the score is thinking this is really getting Saturday-nightkicks : gone sex ! with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took off his pants cooing and his shorts cooing and ran out with both pants and shorts  --  and wallet . " And look ! " she said now , pulling out the wallet , which was green , green like a tree . " So Ive got to go to your pad in case he comes back looking for me . " " Without pants ? " Destiny asked , and adds : " And why my pad ? why not yours ? " Darling Dolly explains it 's too far and too early . Miss Destiny tilted her head , consulting her gay fairy . " Miss Thing says do nt give you the key , " Miss Destiny said , " but then Miss Thing ai nt nevuh been busted  --  so here  --  " Darling Dolly dashed out with the key . Miss Destiny sighed Darling Dolly was positively Too Much , and I noticed Chuck going out , widehat over his eyes , with the flashy fruit .... Lola is still sitting very much alone glowering at her madeup face in the mirror behind the bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had interruptedher story : " And then , before I knew it , Duke was dead . . . . He was a truckdriver , and sometimes we were so poor we couldnt even make it : I had to hustle in drag in order to keep us going  --  of course , he did nt know this  --  " And then remembering The Wealth and the country estate : " Well , you see his family disinheritedhim , they couldnt stand me . " And then remembering the way his family Idolized her : " Well , you see they loved me at first , until they Found Out  --  " ( Now Duke the Aristocrat is Duke the Truckdriver , disinheritedbut oh so in love with Miss Destiny , and on a cold murky damp foggy day his truck turns over on the highway , the brakes screech shrilly , the wheels are turning round , round , round ... . The sirens wail : **31;4599;TOOLONG . And When They Came To Tell Miss Destiny , she senses it before they say anything and says : I Want To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to .... ) " You see I was an orphan , " and then remembering her father who threw her out : " I had lived with my aunt and uncle and called them my father and mother  --  and it was my uncle who threw me out , the same uncle who Raped me when I was eight years old and I screamed it hurt so and my aunt said forget it , it would go away ( she was a degenerate ) . . . . And each time 1 close118 JOHN RECHYmy eyes , I see those goddam wheels going round , round , round  --  and I hear that tune they were playing when I met him . ( Put your little foot ' ) , " she hummed .... " And it wont stop until I hear the crash ! ... Oh ! " ( So Miss Destiny lones it to Washington D.C. where she makes it with men who think shes Real . And when they reach That Point in the cramped car she must insist on , she will say no honey not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course be welltaped . " But thats no reason why we cant have a swinging time anyway . " And if not she will say shes underage and threaten to scream rape . ( And do nt ask how , Or If , she always got away with it . ) But a jealous bartender , who Knows , tells three sailors who want to make it with her that shes not a fish , sties a fruit , and the sailorboyswait outside for her , mean , and start to tear off her beautiful dress and say , If youre a girl wow the world is yours honey , but if youre a goddam queer start praying . . . . And oh Miss Destiny runs as you will begin to think she is always doing , and they grab her roughly as you will begin to think they are always doing , and she rushes into the street and into a taxi passing by luckily and the driver says have you been clipped or raped lady ?  --  and : I will take you to the heat station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and goes back to Philadelphia to place a Wreath on Duke 's grave , and comes to Los Angeles with a Southern Accent .... ) " And 1 became what you see now : a wild restless woman with countless of exhusbands , " Miss Destiny said . " But do you know , baby , that I have never been Really Married ? I mean in White , coming down a Winding Staircase . . . . And I will ! I will fall in love again soon  --  I can feel it  --  and when I do , I will have my Fabulous Wedding , in a pearlwhite gown  --  " and she went on delightedly until she caught sight of Pauline 's reflection in the panel of mirrors behind the bar , and something about the way Pauline was looking in our direction clearly threatened she would come right over and introduce herself and bug Miss Destiny . " Goddam queer , " Miss Destiny murmured , and she was fiercely depressed 3I left the 1-2-3 and went to Ji-Ji 's bar  --  another malehustling and queen bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Night 119awning into a dark cavelike room . Beyond the dark , through a uunel-like opening , the bar leads into a small narrow lunch- ( ounter , where malehustlers and queens sit eating . And Ji-Ji , the old , haggard queen who owns this bar , reigns over it adoringly as if it were a wayward mission  --  a hidden underground shelteringthose rebels from the life that spat her out . . . . Dad-o , the Negro pusher , is here now , huddled at one end of the bar , almost eaten up by the darkness , except where the light from under the bar gleams in shiny eery highlights on his sweaty skin ; he s talking to a skinny boy next to him  --  obviously a pusher . It is much more quiet here than at the 1-2-3  --  the superficial gayety is absent , there is a brooding silence : an undisguised purposefulness to make it . Even the scores who haunt Ji-Ji 's are colder . They stand appraising the young malehustlers as if they were up for auction . As I walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmurs : " Lets get out of here and go to my place , boy  --  I got a bar there myself . " His assurance bugs me strangely . The guilt seizes me powerfully . I feel an overwhelming shame suddenly for looking so easily available . " Youre taking a lot for granted , " I said . He shrugs his shoulders . " It 's Ji-Ji 's , isnt it ? " he says  --  butnotso sure of himself any more  --  he walks away hurriedly ... . I leave the bar immediately , the sudden inexplicable shame scorching me inside . The youngman who had been with Dad-o is now outside . The night is brighter than the bar . . . . The youngmanasks me furtively if I want to turn on . He opens his hand , tiny joints of marijuana squirm in his palm . He looks strangely like a biblical prophet  --  with a beard , infinitely sorrowful eyes . I say no . When I came back to the 1-2-3 , Chuck was back too . He asked me to go outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , " you wan na blast ? " ( I remember the prophet-faced youngman only moments earlier . ) . . . I walk with Chuck along Spring Street , left , across Broadway , then Hill , beyond the tunnel , around the area with all the trees . Chuck says : " I don really dig this stuff , man  --  too much of a hassle to hold any , an I don dig hasslin it noway  --  but somebody turned me on free  --  so might jes as well .... " We squatted there among the shadows , shut in by the trees , smoking120 JOHN RECHY City of Night 121like Indians  --  or maybe , more like children forbiddenly in a garage . We went to Main Street , and Im feeling an intensified sense of perception  --  as if suddenly I can see clearly . Now Main Street is writhing with the frantic nothing-activity in the late hours . We walked into Wally 's , exploding with smoke . Then to Harry 's bar and more smoke , more streaky mirrors , more hungry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house with the winking lights and the pictures of nude women , we saw three girls , and Chuck went casually and talked to them and they said yes . They belonged obviously to that breed of young girls with whom the hustlers periodically prove their masculinity . Like the malehustlers , they live the best they can from day to day . . . . We went back to the 1-2-3 to look for Skipper or Buddy to come along with us . Miss Destiny was standing outside with Lola , and when she saw the girls with us , she stomped angrily inside the bar . We found Skipper , and we got into Buddy 's car and Skipper made it run , and since no one had a place to go , we drove to Echo Park . And the night was miraculously clear as it rarely is in Los Angeles , and the moon hung sadly in the sky as unconcerned as the world , as we sexhuddled in the car with the three lost girls .... We left the girls at Silverlake and came back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at us shrieking , " You know whats the crazy matter with you , all of you ? youre so dam gone on your own damselves you have to hang around queens to prove youre such fine dam studs , and the first dam cunt that shows , you go lapping after her like hot dam dawgs ! " Then she cooled off right away and said drive her to Bixel Street , where someone ( shes playing it mysterious like someone is turning her on free because shes such a gone queen ) is laying all kinds of stuff on her . When we got to Bixel , it turns out Truth 's daddy has paid for the stuff , including a tin of maryjane and rolls of bees , and he s asked Miss Destiny to take it to her place and Bring Everybody and theyll be up later and we 'll have a party . We rode back , and on Broadway the cop-patrol is driving meanly . Skipper put on his dark shades , Chuck lowered his wide hat , I sank into the seat ( the junk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the cops  --  " Yoohoo , girls "  --  shes flying out of her gay head . Luckily they did nt hear her and they already had someone in back , so they went by with everyone-hating faces . Just as Skipper parked , Trudi 's daddy drives up in his tough stationwagon with Trudi behind him wrapped in  --  I swear  --  a fur stole  --  " Like Mae West , " she cooed . And we all went up to Miss Destiny's. 4Destiny 's place is two ugly tight rooms with naileddown windowshadesand a head . You climb two narrow stairways and then make your way through a maze of cramped halls lighted just enough by greasy lightbulbs to reveal the cobwebs and the dirt  --  long narrow corridors like in the movie-serial when we were kids : And the Dragon Lady put Terry and the Pirates in a narrow hallwayand she punched a button and the walls kept coming closer ... threatening to crrrrrrush ! everyone to . . . death ! ! Miss Destiny opened the door and turned on the light . The light screamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceiling into long nooselike shadows . Darling Dolly Dane was curled up on a couch , and Lola and a seedy-looking soldier were carrying on on another  --  this is the kitchen but it has two bedcouches . Lola hollers in her ugly man 's voice turn the fucking lights off . " Put out thy own dam lights , as the stunning Desdemonasaid , " Miss Destiny answered . Both the soldier and Lola started adjusting their clothes , and Miss Destiny says are nt they Too Much ?  --  everyone here has seen boys and girls , and besides , all the world is a swinging stage ! Now Lola goes into the other room , and in a few minutes , lo and behold ! here she is back , in Japanese drag ! posing at the door : kimono with beautiful colored butterflies  --  sandalsslantedeyes ! and she is saying something like teeny-vosey which she says means kiss in Chinese  --  but the soldier ( he playing the stud with her when we walked in ) isnt paying her any more attention , and it 's obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a godownfruit serviceman  --  a not very attractive butch fruit whom Lola thought was a stud ( and queens are fooled more often than they admit ) . Pissed off , Lola grabs the soldier 's cap , pushes it122 JOHN RECHY City of Night 123over his head , and very much like a rough man shoves him through the door : " You got ta make reveille , dear ! " And while we 're turning on juice and joints and pills  --  Trudi 's fat daddy saying , " Come on boys , come on turn on "  --  palming all of us excitedly  --  the queens are changing into high drag in the other room  --  much more successfully than Lola . Now Trudi minces out in blacklace negligee , panties and brassiere ( her chest taped to give her real-appearing cleavage under the falsies )  --  looking I have to say disturbingly real like one of those girls in the back pages of the scandal magazines that advertise those slinky gowns and underclothes with crazy names like tigerlily nightie and heaven-in-the-boudoir panties and French-frivolity brassiere  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Miss Destiny ( being more modest and more the regal type anyway ) makes her entrance , last of course , in green satin eveningdress and fluffed out rair with golden sequins ... . Right after that , Buddy came in with a score . Miss Destiny says shes sorry but theyll have to use the head . The score is obviouslydisappointed . A few minutes later and we hear the score coughing spitting . Lola says acidly she despises amateurs and queers . Now they come out , and the score is not only disappointed but nervous , afraid of the scene . As he started toward the door , Trudi calls out , " Do nt be nervous , dear  --  blame the beads ! "  --  and Skipper is going to Talk to him  --  but Buddy said no he got all the bread himself  --  and : " Did you hear the square spitting , man ? did you ?  --  " indignantly "  --  Christ , and I only pretended to shoot ! " Darling Dolly is doing an imitation strip , proud of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the queen at the 1-2-3 earlier ) , she says , " Sssssssssssufferrrrrrrrr .... " Trudi 's daddy is giggling almost hysterically now , opening drinks , passing pills , joints . Suddenly theres a racket outside the window , like someone throwing a bottle , and Miss Destiny says , " It 's that psycho bitch ! " and pulls the shades from the nails and theres the sexhungry nympho in the next building hanging out the window in her halfslip and brassiere ( and she isnt badlooking ) saying whats going on we 're disturbing the peace . Her piece , giggles Trudi , smothering herself cozily in her stole . And Miss Destiny coos , " Come on over , dear , come on over , " to placate her , and the sexhungrywoman almost jumps through the window  --  " I 'll be right over , hear ? " " Hoddawg ! " said Chuck , and this puts Miss Destiny on . In just a few minutes heres the nympho and says it 's so warm she 'll take off her blouse if you do nt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Appalled at such uncouth effrontery , Darling Dolly Dane , smoking elegantly , inhaled accidentally and almost choked . To top it all off for Miss Destiny , who was becoming Most Depressed , heres another queen at the door : Miss Bobbi , with a drunk who tries to sober up immediately , rejects the scene , turns to leave  --  but Skipper gets a chance to Talk to him . " Cool it , cholly , " is all Skipper said , and the man reached for his wallet nervously , hands the money to Skipper , and stumbles out hurriedly . Miss Bobbi says icily hand over the bread which rightly belongs to her . Skipper gave her a nofooling ? look . Miss Bobbi says she brought the score here , after all ! Skipper says who got it ? Miss Bobbi says she was going to until Skipper came on so bigassedly . Skipper says the score would have clipped her , and you saw it , jack , the score gave the bread to him . Miss Bobbi swished out in a huff . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying oh no , " Miss Thing , what are we doing here ? "  --  clinging to a Poor Pitiful Pearl doll on the couch  --  a sadeyed orphan doll  --  but everyone was talking and moving and no one paid her any attention . So she freshened up her makeup peering into a tiny stonestudded compact saying shes a mess , and please , to me , sit beside her , please ! Then she imagined she saw Darling Dolly in the mirror making sexeyes at me , and Miss Destiny says Well That Is The Limit ! " Darling Dolly Dane is a common whore ! " Miss Destiny almost-shouted at me and no one hears her but me , the radio turned on to one of those California nightstationswith the smothered rock-n-roll sexmoans , " and all of you ! especially you ! are just bums ! nogood lowlife hobos ! who will end up ! on Thunderbird ! or worse than hobos : hypes ! hopelesslyhung up and cant get it ! " and shes going on very unlike the gay Miss swinging Destiny . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iamdoing ! here ! amongst all this : tuh-rash ! I ! Went ! ! To College ! ! ! And Read Shakespeare ! ! ! ! " 124 JOHN RECHYI whispered do nt tell anyone , but me too . " Next youll be the Prince of Wales , " she says bitchily , gloweringat Chuck and Buddy making up to the nympho , who was fanning herself with her slip now . And Miss Destiny goes on haughtily  --  sure of her ground : " Then  --  tell  --  me : if you read Shakespeare , Who Is Desdemona ? " doubting it superiorly , giving me The Supreme Test : Shakespeare and his queenly he-roines who were first , remember , played by men . I answered ( and remember the pills , the liquor , the maryjane ) : " Desdemona was a swinging queen in the French Quarter who married a spadestud who dug her until a jealous pusher turned him on that his queen was making it with a studsailor , and the spade smothered the queen Desdemona and the heat came for him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long while  --  not speaking . And as she was staring at me like that , Lola  --  who had gone to the head outside , Destiny 's being occupied  --  returned howling theres a man in the head outside and he ai nt got no pants ! Miss Destiny sprang up , rushed at Darling Dolly Dane : " You dizzy silly cunt ! you brought him here did nt you ? " " Where else , Miss Destiny ? " Darling Dolly Dane pleads helplessly , covering her face dramatically . " Go give him his pants ! " " Flow can I , Destiny ? I do nt know where I left them ! " " Miss Destiny ! " Miss Destiny screamed . " Miss Destiny dammit ! " Darling Dolly Dane shrieked back . " Here ! " Miss Destiny rushes into the other room , comes back with a pair of pants ( which turn out later to be Buddy 's , who is with the nympho in the other room ) , empties the pockets on the floor , tosses the pants at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transom ! " Darling Dolly rushes out whimpering . " Silly bitch , " says Miss Destiny , glaring at her when she returnsgiggling now the man must have thought the pants came from Heaven . Now Miss Destiny sat on the floor next to me . " You do know who Desdemona is ! " Then again there was a long silence between us . City of Night 1251Suddenly ! Suddenly , and strangely  --  strangely then but not so now : now , inevitably and very clearly like this : Something was released insideMiss Destiny and something established between us in that moment by the simple fact of the mutual knowledge of Desdemona : that something released and that something established which she had yearned for with others from person to person in this locked world  --  and trying always futilely before , had given up . And of course too it was the liquor , and rejection earlier smashing at her stomach like a huge powerful with whom three of us had gone earlier  --  and this importantly : the loneliness churning beneath that gay facade desperately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore shared : released by something as small as this , the common knowledge of the sad sad tale of Desdemona  --  or maybe more accurately than released : say , erupting out of the depths of her consciousness , aroused by the earlier rejection , resulting in that rare fleeting contact made rarely somehow like a match struck in the dark for a breathless sputtering instant .... And so now , because of Desdemona and all this meant to Miss Destiny , and all the things set off from the knowledge , Miss Destiny blurted suddenly frantically : " Oh God ! ... Sometimes when Im very high and sitting maybe at the 1-2-3 , I imagine that an angel suddenly appears and stands on the balcony where the band is going  --  or maybe Im on Main Street or in Pershing Square  --  and the angel says , All right , boys and girls , this is it , the world is ending , and Heaven or Hell will be to spend eternity just as you are now , in the same place among the same people  --  Forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know suddenly what that means  --  and I start to run but I cant run fast enough for the evil angel , he sees me and stops me and Im Caught .... " ( Like in the game of statues long ago and someone swung you round and round and you stayed frozen as you fell , and the angel is the swinger now .... ) And Miss Destiny went on desperately : " And I know it sounds crazy but I came here believing  --  no , not really Believing  --  but hoping maybe , maybe somehow crazily126 JOHN RECHYhoping !  --  that some producer would see me , think I was Real  --  Discover me !  --  make me a Big Star ! and I would go to the dazzling premieres and Louella Hopper would interview me and we would stand in the spotlights and no one would ever know I wasnt Real  --  " ( That impossible strange something that will never hap-pen .... ) And Miss Destiny rushes on feverishly : " And at night in bed drowning in the dark , I think tomorrow will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or I come unexpectedly on myself in a mirror or a reflection in a window , and it takes my breath : Me ! ! . . . And I think about my wedding and how FabulousI 'll be  --  but I want to fly out of my skin ! jump out ! be someone else ! so I can leave Miss Destiny far , far behind .... " ( And Miss Destiny wakes up at night terrified by the knowledge of that strange impossibility , and the darkness screams Loneliness ! and impossibility , whirling around us  --  and soon youll have to face the morning and yourself  --  the same , again .... ) In the other room someone yelled , and it was the nympho . I heard Chuck shouting Wh0000000ppeeeee ! ! . . . and Darling Dolly shrieked : " Chuck , get off !  --  thats Buddy ! " And Lola came out rushing yelling at no one , " Leave me alone ! Im ugly ! Irn ugly ! "  --  her face smeared grotesquely with paint and enormoustears  --  " Im ugly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her fur stole  --  momentarily leaving Skipper , who is passed out drunk ... . " All this is going on , " Miss Destiny sighed , hugging the orphan doll , " and when tomorrow someone will maybe ask us , What did you do last night ?  --  we 'll answer , Nothing . . . . And , oh , do you believe in God ? " she asks me abruptly , and I answered it 's a cussword . " Oh , yes , my dear , " Miss Destiny said , " there is a God , and He is one hell of a joker . Just  --  look  --  " and she indicates her lovely green satin dress and then waves her hand over the entire room . " Trapped ! . . . But one day , in the most lavish drag youve evuh seen  --  heels ! and gown ! and beads ! and spangled earrings !  --  Im going to storm heaven and protest ! Here I am ! ! ! ! ! I 'll yell  --  and I 'll shake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will cringe ! " Now Miss Destiny leans toward me and I can smell the sweetCity of Night 127o t- and the sweet . . . lost . . . perfume  --  and with a frantict  --  that only abysmal loneliness can produce , she whispered : " , Marry me please , dear ! " 5I was out in the street with the jazzcat from New York wearing dark shades who had somehow turned up later at Destiny 's . And Los Angeles was dreary in the earlyhours with the sidewalks wet where theyve just watered them and the purplish haze of the early morning . And he asked me which way I was going . That way , I said . Me too , he said . And we walked through the streets . Then somewhere a bell began to sound , and I looked up instinctivelyat the sky . . . . One day that bell will sound and Miss Destiny 's evil angel will appear ! .. . I left Los Angeles without seeing Miss Destiny after that night . And I went to San Diego , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few of the people I had known were gone  --  even in that short time  --  back to the Midwest or to Times Square , or had been busted , or moved to Coffee Andy 's in Hollywood , or gone to ( : olden Miami . They had disappeared , one day : One day youre here and thats fine , and the next day youre gone and thats fine too , and someone has that very day come in to take your place whatever it might have been . Chuck was still here , boots and widehat . And Skipper ... And Trudi still blaming it on the beads .. . I asked Chuck about Miss Destiny , one night , when we were again at the 1-2-3 , but this time it was quiet . Not even the juke-box was playing . Everyone was broke . Not a single score . Even the pushers hung dismally inside the bar . Chuck said he ha.dnt seen Miss Destiny in a long time , she had just disappeared . Somewhere . " Man , she was a gone queen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of tribute to Miss Destiny . I asked him did she have her Fabulous Wedding . " Oh , sure , man , I did not go though  --  someone tole me about it , she had it out in Hollywood , man , in this real Fine pad , an I heard she akchoolly dressed like a bride , man  --  she married128 JOHN RECHYsome studhustler from See-a-dal , and it musta been a real Fine bash , if I re-call Miss Destinee right .... " Then he went on to tell me he had a job washing dishes for a few days but he quit and how some score has promised to put him in some malehouse in Hollywood where he 'll make at least $50 a day . Later I saw Pauline ( and now the jukebox was playing the song which I will always think of as part of L.A. : For Your Love  --  and the sad throaty sounds of Ed Townsend meaning it ) , whom ( Pauline ) I had met before I left , having found Miss Destiny 's warning that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Big with how she would have her own beautyshop in a few weeks and whoever she dug would have it Made and Made Big . " Let me tell you about Destiny  --  " Pauline said . " You left beforeshe got married  --  well , she had her wedding all right , she did nt invite me , but I heard , and it was Hor-ri-ble . It was A-trocee-ous . She had her winding staircase all right , too , and she stumbled on her train and ripped her veil and came face down ! Then the place was raided . And thats where Miss Destiny the college co-ed is now , busted !  --  in the joint  --  again !  --  for masquerading  --  and this is not the first time she gets knocked over so she will be cooling it there for quite a while ! And can you imagine the sight ? Miss Destiny in bridal drag sitting crying in the paddywagonthis is her wedding day ? ... " Trudi claims Miss Destiny is living in Beverly Hills with the man who sponsored the wedding ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but they did nt , and she says she wishes now she 'd been a beautiful bridesmaid like Destiny asked her , and it broke Destiny 's heart when Trudi said no but thats the beads ) . " And I hear the Destiny looked simply Fabulous in her gown and red hair , " says Trudi , " and , honey , it just goes to show you some more about those goddam beads  --  here the Destiny meets this rich daddy who wants to sec a queen get married in drag to a butch studhustler , and the Destiny says does he have a winding staircase ? and he does .... " Well , anyway , Trudi says , so far as she knows , Miss Destiny is still living in Beverly Hills ( Skipper says oh no , Bel Air , if she really made it Big ) with the rich daddy and her stud husband . " The rich cholly , " says Skipper knowingly , " I bet he digsCity of Night 129Destiny 's stud , not Destiny  --  but he gets kicks watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s queer  --  " and Skipper goes on to tell me how he s tired of the small hustling and how he s ready to push back into the Bigtime  --  and Trudi says , " Do nt be nervous , babe , youll shake the beads . " And so , of Miss Destiny 's Wedding there are many versions . No one seems to have gone to it . But everyone has heard about it . Only one thing is certain . Miss Destiny is no longer around . And I wondered if somehow she had escaped her Evil Angel . And again for a period I avoided the park and the bars  --  and when I came back , Chuck of course was still around . And now we 're sitting in Pershing Square at the same place where I first met Miss Destiny .... ( And Jenny Lu is in the park too , as if The Angel had got her number  --  woe-uh ! ... and Holy Moses . . . and Saint Tex , who outstayed The Word and was reConverted by Saint Thunderbird to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still bleeding wax . . . . ) Suddenly Chuck said : " Oh , man , did you hear about Miss Destinee ?  --  you remember her , that far-out queen with the redhair ? Well , man , some queen was saying how she got this letter from Destinee . An remember this ah this ah head doctor she was going to , man ?  --  the one she said she would have on the couch next time ? Well , he finally cured Miss Destinee , man  --  Miss Destinee wrote she ain a queen no more , she has **27;4632;TOOLONG turned stud , man !  --  an that ain all , man ! " he goes on gleefully "  --  Miss Destinee wrote she is getting married , man !  --  to a real woman ! . . . " And Chuck pushed his wide hat over his eyes as if to block his sudden vision of a world in which such crazy things can happen . I imagine Miss Destiny sitting lonesomely in Somewhere , Big City , America  --  carefully applying her makeup  --  and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nt know whats become of you , nor where you are  --  but that story Chuck just told me , as you yourself should be the first one to admit , is oh Too Much to believe ! City of Night 131whelming sadness as intense as if I were the only person in the world who had ever felt it for this life : awed by the terrifying spectacle of this outcast boiling world . And so the park became the focal point of my life , those long , long afternoons . CITY OF NIGHTFROM FACE TO FACE , FROM ROOM to rOOm , from bed to bed , the shape of the world I had chosen emerged  --  clearly but without definable meaning . Each morning the pale sun rose in the imitation-bluesky of Los Angeles , and the endless resurrection of each new day began . Like the palmtrees that lined the streets of the city , the world seemed to be shrugging indifferently . For me then there followed a period of untrammeled anarchy as I felt my life stretching toward some kind of symbolic night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With those many people  --  only in those moments when I was desired  --  the moments before we became strangers again after the intimacy  --  I felt an electric happiness , as if the relentless flow of life had stopped , poised on the very pinpoint of youth ; and for those moments , youth was suspended unmoving . Now I began to feel that world demanding even further anarchy . Often I remembered the man I had met that first afternoon in Los Angeles , when , with his money already in my hands , I had suddenly found myself unable to steal from him . It was something that remained unfinished : a test prepared by that chosen world which I had failed . . . . The man 's face dimly mysteriously haunted me . There was still , too , the narcissistic obsession with myself  --  those racked interludes in the mirror  --  the desperate strange craving to be a world within myself . And I felt somehow , then , that only the mirror could really judge me for whatever I must be judged . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would stand often in the midst of the masked turbulence of Pershing Square , watching it fascinated . At the same time , I felt an overLikea lord surveying his kingdom , Sergeant Morgan marches through the park in the afternoons , nodding condescendingly at the familiar faces of the perennial park pensioners pinned to the benches . . . . I see him stomping along the sidewalk now , imperiouslyflanked by two younger cops . They walk like soldiers , in perfect step , the two on each side like younger , if slimmer , imitations of the fat one in the middle , marching as if to the cadenced rhythm of a drum heard only by them . I had seen the fat cop often  --  but he had nt stopped me . Now , watching the determinedmarch , I think : He s after someone . As they approached me  --  and they were looking straight ahead  --  the fat one turns sharply , toward me . " Come on , you ! " he barked . Boom ! Boom ! Boom ! Along the way they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sullenfaced boy of about 18 ; the other , squarefaced , older , smiling and composed , cocky even , as if this to him is routine . Now down the escalator we go . Into the parking lot below the park , across the lot : The people getting their cars stare at us , wondering what weve done , hoping for the worst . . . . Up the steps again , into the other side of the park . Down more steps , through a door , into a room , where , ostensibly , they keep park tools  --  but hidden in typical sneak-cop fashion , it 's a place for police interrogations , like a baby joint . Inside , another policeman is sitting at a desk . There are two small rooms . On a board behind the desk are many photographs of hardened wanted faces : staring stonily into the room as they had stared into the camera and at the cop behind it  --  as they had stared defiantly at the world . On a small bench facing the desk , the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identificationscene to begin . They frisk us . They look through our wallets , our pockets , they132 JOHN RECHYask how much money we have  --  what we 're wanted for , sneering when all three of us answer : " Nothing . " They check our arms for " tattoos "  --  hypo needle marks . . . . Then they run their hands slowly down our legs , between them  --  and I am amused at how lovingly , thoroughly , slowly they do that part . Now they glare at us disappointed when they find nothing incriminating on us . The one at the desk calls the police station . We hear our names , code numbers covering certain offenses . Again theyre disappointed : none of us here is Wanted . As the cop at the desk writes out spot-interrogation cards , the fat cop stations himself before us , stands fat-legged , bull-spread , the stick like a scepter before him . He reminds me of an arbitrary general-sir . He has a round chubby face , like a soft beachball , red ; tiny mud-eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red cap , he would resemble a fierce Santa Claus . He booms : " IAmSergeant Morgan ! " As If Announcing The Second Coming Of The Lord . " Why I brought you down here , " he says , " is I never talked to none of you before  --  but I been keeping my eye on you  --  I seen you hanging around the park . " Eyes snap calculatingly from one of us to the other . " And I got ta know everyone in this park ... . Now I do nt know what youre after . But I suspect ! . . . What Im saying is : Watch out ! I wont have no wise guys in My Park ... . No pickpockets , No hypes . No heads . . . . No hustlers ! Understand ? " He studied each of us for a reaction . We look at him in deliberate blankness . " Im getting a good look at you now " ( and he was ) " and I got cards on allayou . If I keep seeingya in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I 'll do it ; and when they let you out , I 'll grabya again . This here ai nt no warning . It Is A Threat . . . . Ever-one 's hearda Pershing Square , and I figure thats why youre here  --  cause you heard what goes on . Well , it ai nt so easy as you think  --  and it ai nt gon na be , not while Im around  --  no sir ! " He swings his stick menacingly . I get the feeling one of the other cops is a rooky and the fat one is trying to impressCity of Night 133him . " Now lotta people in this park knows me and likes me , " he went on , " they tell me things I wan na know  --  so I always know wot goes on . And Im gon na let you innonna secret : We got plainclothesmen all over , watchinya . You wont get away with rruthin ! Now maybe I cain tell you stay outta the park cause it 's public  --  but I sure as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped abruptly , as if for applause . " Go on now , get out ! " he snaps like a tough cop in a movie . He turns his back on us  --  petulantly . Outside , the sullenfaced boy walks a short distance into the park with me , says : " Im beginning to think this town is nowhere , man , I ai nt scored for nothing today  --  but I get stopped by the fuzz . " Then catching sight of an obviously intrigued man-in-a-suit , he goes and sits next to him . Like all the others warned to stay out of the park , I continued to return and the fat cop did nt bother me . And this is how they do , unless youre wanted for something definite : They warn you to stay out , they leave you alone  --  and then when the heat is on ( when some robbery supposedly involving a young Pershing Square vagrant has been headlined in the papers  --  or , as I had heard Trudi describe it once at the 1-2-3 , " when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they pick you up for vagrancy . And the papers gleefully announce : RAID IN PERSHING SQUARE . Now , as the anarchy welled inside me , I went through each day on pills and marijuana . And then one afternoon , High , sitting in the park , hearing the convulsed chanting , the spiritual singing  --  in the midst of the lonesome hunting , the sexual hunger in the eyes all around  --  the franticness to fill each space of time with something !  --  I imagined  --  Suddenly ! as if in a nightmare  --  as the crowds emerged from the depths of the subterranean garage , swarmed from across the streets  --  that all the world was pouring into Pershing Square in a tidal wave of faces  --  that frantically each person would shout his Loss  --  into Eternity  --  to an uncaring Heaven ! 134 JOHN RECHYIn panic , I returned to that rented room on Hope Street . I shut the windows , drew the shades , bolted the door . Still , I could hear life shrieking at me ... . Now again there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I took a job . . . . Again the guilt . At night I found relief from the strange terror in the joints of marijuana which I smoked on the roof of that hotel . As the false clarity of the weed seized me , I would look onto the city showered by the black of the Night  --  and imagine , as if in a dumb show in which all emotion is muted , that I was separated from the world : as I had felt as a boy watching out the window , separated from life . The world was revealing its death to me by the process of slow discovery : the slowly gnawing loss of innocence ; and I found myself longing for the God in Whom , unquestioningly , I had believed as a child . But this world of loneliness and desperation belied Him . The sky was now a black cave where once it had been limitless , stretching into that Heaven of childhood angels and peace . As the doleful sounds of the bells from the church across the street mourned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direction of Pershing Square : One day , in sorrow at His own creation , God plunged into Hell .... Now the world spun dizzily like a ferric wheel out of control . CHUCK : Rope Heavenby the Neck1HEY , MAN !  --  HOW YOU MAKIN IT ? . . . Cummon over  --  jineme . " Chuck sat familiarly on the railing at Pershing Square under the statue of a World War I soldier valiantly facing the street . Wearing a new pair of cowboy boots  --  resplendently Bright ( orange , brown , traces of yellow )  --  which he s showing off by rolling his levis an extra turn  --  Chuck sits there as if on his own frontporch . " Where you been ? " he asks me . ( I did nt tell him this , but I 'll tell you : After staying away from the park as compulsively as , always , I returned , I had gone to San Diego again : to the beach at La Jolla set like a jewel in a ring of gleaming sand . I would lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the sky , at the patterns of the hastily smeared clouds : as I had lain looking into the El Paso sky when I was a kid , when I had climbed that range of mountains called Cristo Rey , to get closer to that Sky ; hugged by the jutting sandy hills : lying there  --  alone  --  looking up  --  at times at the sky itself , times at the clouds , times toward the giant statue of the peasant-faced Christ at the top of the mountain . . . . And years later I was lying on the sand at La Jolla , trying now perhaps to find in the shape of those California beach-clouds the lost patterns I had found as a kid . Vainly . . . . The idleness of the not-yet crowded beach hinting lazily of spring  --  and the keyed-up idleness of the streets in the city  --  San Diego !  --  at night swarming with aimless sailors  --  this only emphasized the formless terror and panic . . . . I returned to Los Angeles , to that same room on Hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same maryjane daze whose miraclesGG136 JOHN RECHYwere slowly diminishing . . . . And I returned , soon , to Pershing . iquare , as , before , I had returned to Times Square .... ) I only told Chuck : " Ive been away . " " Ain that somethin now ? " he said . " Me , too  --  I been away . too . I had this gig justa while ago . " He yawned as if even the memory of work tired him . " It was in this parking lot out in Hollywood . This score I met out here , he got me that job . But , hell , I figure : So I make a few bucks working , I blow them  --  jes like that ! Shoot , I get along jes as good without . Why hassle moren you got to ? " Then , squinting at the sun , he added philosophically : " Theres jes two kindsa people that don got ta work : Those that got all the money , an those that ain got none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ain got nothin . " I sat next to him on the railing . In my mind , later , Chuck , like that statue , would become a part of my memory of Pershing Square : Chuck , sitting there complacently in the lazy afternoons , in the same spot , shoulders hunched , hands holding on to the railing , balancing himself  --  long , lanky legs locked loosely under the bar by booted toes as if on a fence , on a ranch ; sandy hair jutting out from the wide hat over long sideburns  --  as he looks at the passing scene of Pershing Square with what I would usually think was amusement  --  but wonder , occasionally , Is it more like bewilderment ? . . . When something unusual  --  unusual in the sense of Pershing Square  --  happened within the area of his vision  --  or , rather , of his consciousness , since the two seemed at times to be completely separated  --  he would shout : " Yippee ! " with more energy than he would muster for anything else  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movies rooting in childexcitementfor The Rangers . Others in that restless , nervous world came and went , suddenly disappearing altogether . But Chuck seemed always to be here . And unlike the other youngmen hustling the park , he seldom even moved about hunting for scores . Not because of vanity or self-confidence , I am sure , but because he preferred to move as little as possible , he waits for someone to come to him . And , usually , they did : In that world of downtown Los Angeles , Chuck was one of its best-liked citizens  --  as much by the scores as by other hustlers  --  perhaps because , with him , everything always seemed to be going right .... He moved effortlessly from dayCity of Night 137to day as if taking a necessary journey which he must make as easily as possible . " You know what I mean about hassling a gig , don you ? " he asked me . " I mean , crazy if you dig what youre doing an thats what you want  --  but jes workin  --  ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . Hell , I made a few bucks in that there parkin lot  --  an  --  dig  --  I bought me these here boots . " He raises one gaudybootedfoot for inspection . " Tough , huh ? " he asked . " I wanted some with Red on em  --  but they didn have none . " I nodded yes on both counts : I understood about working  --  and the boots were " tough . " " So : I hang aroun here an make it jes as good , " he said . It 's that limbo-time in Los Angeles arbitrarily called " spring , " merely because , technically , summer has nt come . The weather inches toward summer , boundaryless , and the only difference you notice , in the park , is that the crowds become even thicker as the days become slowly warmer . Now , in the park  --  and it is mid-afternoon  --  there are the familiar sights of mangled American outcasts of every breed . Under the drooping palmtrees , old men and women sit on benches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ledges , the vagrants of all ages  --  the younger ones out to score and the older ones out merely to fill the necessary space of time required of that day to qualify them as being " alive "  --  sit singly or in groups , always waiting : the masklike faces of people expecting anything or nothing ... . " When I got this gig , parking cars , " Chuck was going on , " I figured theres got to be that malehouse somewhere in Hollywood I heard so much about , an someone 'll spot me , sign me up for it . " This was a familiar thing with him  --  said now half-jokingly . " This score , man , he says : ' Chuck , you jes work in my parkin lot an someone 's bound to show that knows where it is an you can go there an apply . ' But , hell , nothin happened , An I Got Tired . " He shrugs his shoulders . His hat was pushed away from his face , turned toward the sun . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very long , " an  --  uh  --  it makes me  --  unhhh  --  real-sleepy . " Directly behind us , the howling voice of the Negro woman who preaches there every day rises in a wail as she goes through a138 JOHN RECHYreligious Revelation . She clutches her throat , gasping out choked obsessed mutterings ; eyes shut deliriously , one hand dangling intimatelybetween her slightly spread arched legs  --  like a burlesque queen . " Comin , Lawd ! " she announces triumphantly . She gasped now as if shes seen Him , lurking among the California palmtrees . She greets Him with bumping hips . " Comin , Lawdee ! " and her hands are stretched out in supplication or welcome . And Chuck said happily : " Yippeee ! Man-oh-man ! She has made it !  --  I swear she has made it ! " Then he yells to her : " Grab Him , lady ! You jes grab-im while you got-im  --  an don let go ! " Now he turns to face me . He yawns again . " The best way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take it slow . " " Get where ? " He shrugged . " Wherever . . . . I mean , wherever you wan na go . Like for her  --  " indicating the Negro woman "  --  her , see , she wants to make it to Heaven . . . . Or , I mean , like , if you wan na make it to New York or Denver  --  . . . Or Nowhere , like me .... " And there it was . There was what had intrigued me about Chuck from the very beginning : His easy , happy acceptance of Nothingness . It wasnt resignation  --  it was acceptance . I look at him as he smiles into the bright glare of the sun . . . . In the midst of all the turbulence , he was always enviably cool  --  almost as if some compassionateangel had whispered a secret to him ( which must have been something like : " Rest " ) , and based on that secret , he seemed to live his life untouched by turmoil  --  yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skip , " Chuck is going on . " That stud , he is gon na bust wide open one of these days  --  I mean , he is gon na explode ! Boom ! It 's like he has got ta firecracker with a long fuse up his ass  --  an that fuse gets shorter an shorter  --  an one day : llaroom ! ! . . . An take Buddy : he is gon na end up with his picture hangin in a postofficc .... An Tiger  --  one day he is gon na kill one of them guys he makes it with  --  he hates everyone , man ... . An you too , man , " he says to me now , " hell , you always ack like youre hyped up or comin off : Always movin . Where you think you gon na go so fast ?  --  an what 's gon na be there if you get there ? ... Me , I 'll take it real slow , real cool  --  easy  --  I ' 11 last longer . " And so how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forCity of Night 139me , was Youth ? With the stark realization that I could never outrun It , I became more and more anxious to find some kind of meaning in Youth itself . . . . And so how can I explain this to Chuck ?  --  always smiling , always drifting happily , effortlessly . ... He was right about the other youngmen hustling Main Street and the park . Although they never spoke of their terror  --  and for that matter neither did I  --  it was stamped in every frantic gesture , in every empty pose of unconcern . . . . We worked at indolence from bar to park to bar . . . . Not Chuck . His idleness had an aspect of purity . Again : The world for him was a vast plain which he must occupy for a space of time , easily . . . . And yet  --  .. . Yet there was something incomplete about his easygoingness . " Now there is one thing I wouldnt mind , " he was going on good-humoredly . " I wouldnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Out in Hollywood . Wouldnt that be a gassy kick ?  --  get signed up workin there ? Even hustle chicks for a change . Man , I will tell you somethin : Usually I don get no real good buzz outta guys swinging on my joint . Most of the time , I fall asleep . When I fall asleep , I ain got no problem . I always sleep with a Harlon .... " With Chuck  --  and I knew this instinctively and without a doubt  --  there was nothing ulterior in his making it with males . It was merely easier in the world in which he found himself . That sexually he liked only girls , I never doubted . The other scene would have been too complicated for him to hassle . .. . And I had never heard even the scores and queens , who would often in bitchiness claim that " today 's trade is tomorrow 's competition , " say it about Chuck . " Not that I got anything against anyone swinging on a joint , dig ?  --  if they wan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little he condemned , little he did nt accept  --  even to being rousted by the cops . . . . Once , weeks before , sitting with him at Hooper 's coffee-and-donuts after two in the morning , we had been picked up at random from the other faces there by two cops . Chuck had remained lackadaisically cool , almost Philosophical . He told me : " Shoot , unless they really want you for something , we will be back here in jes a few minutes . On weekends , man , this late , they got too many in the joint already . . . . But we are gon na take a little trip to the glasshouse , " he **26;4661;TOOLONG 0thirst and somewhere , in a poor street , she had gone into a little brown-painted cafe where , on an oilclothed counter above the cups and tea urns , globes of orange and lemon squash turned under a celluloid orange and lemon . She asked for a lemon squash and when the woman had poured it from a stop-tap underneath , Fanny found she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat . The men in the cafe stared as she had to come out and the woman 's indignant voice sounded after her down the street . She went into a church . Somewhere in the back of her min was " a cup of cold water "  --  I suppose I was a little delirious , thought Fanny  --  but there was , of course , no water in the church , not for the public . She had knelt down in the first pew , but not to pray , her mind was too numb . Then she had felt faint and had to sit down ; her whole body was dizzy and bruised ; Rob had hurt in the fierceness of that ecstasy . She was tired , and satisfied as she had never been satisfied before and , I fell asleep again , thought Fanny . When she woke it was dark . Only the sanctuary lamp burned by the high altar and its jewel-red warmth made her think of Rob . As she came out of the church  --  and for a moment she had thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only to find it open  --  under a lamp post she looked at her watch . " Chirico 's at seven . " It was half past eight . Before 1 see him , I must tidy and wash my face , thought Fanny . There was a public lavatory in the next tube station . Having no money , she had to use the free cubicle and could not wash , only rinse her hands under the tap ; but , using a square of mirror , she took off her hat and tried to4 1re-do her hair  --  but I had n't a comb . She had been watched by the young West Indian attendant , and , " I ca n't tip you , I have n't a penny with me , " she wanted to say but she could not speak . Outside again , she took a taxi ; the doormanat Chirico 's will pay , unless Rob has given up and gone . He was there , sitting , watching , waiting . When he saw her he came quickly across the room to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in these last weeks it had become theirs , part of us , thought Fanny . He took her hat and gloves , undid her soaking coat , and gave them to the waiter , gave her her bag  --  " I found it in the flat "  --  and ordered brandy in a voice she had not heard him use before . Is it the one he uses on the set ? she wondered . " Did you think I was n't coming ? " She tried to smile but her voice was so cracked and dry it frightened her . " I knew you could n't not come now , " said Rob . He did not ask any questions , only made her drink the brandy and every now and then he took her hand and cradled it in his . " Do n't talk . Do n't think . Drink , " he said . That was the first time I had ever drunk brandy , thought Fanny . With it and the food Rob made her eat , not asking her what she wanted but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was beginning to creep into her bones , tranquillity fell upon her . " I have known joy , " she could have said , " joy complete . Not many women can say that . Rob will go away . He must . It 's in the nature of things . He has this new picture to make in Africa . I . . . " And here she flinched as she thought of Darrell . He , her husband , had turned into an intruder , almost into a thief . Poor Darrell . What had he done to deserve this ? but she would not think of42him now , not yet , thought Fanny . I do n't know what I shall do , but I have had my joy . Nothing can take that away from me . When the waiter had brought their coffee and they were left alone , Rob had put his hand in his pocket and brought out a case , twin to the one on the villa dressing-table . " I could n't go to the meeting and I had to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he opened it and held it out to her . On the white velvet she saw a deep sparkle  --  no , not a sparkle , a glow , the colour of the sanctuary lamp , deep red , Rob 's colour , as it became for Fanny . " I wanted a ruby , " said Rob and he put his hand over hers , " I would say heart 's blood but they call it pigeon 's blood ! " he said . " But Rob , what is it ? " " Your ring . " " My ring ? " Fanny was dazed . " Men usually give a ring to the woman they are going to marry . " Cliirico 's panelled walls , its prints of travellers , the pinkshadedlamps , the tables with their white cloths , carnations , plates , glasses , bottles , the black and white of waiters , the white coats of the boys , seemed to tilt together into a blur and run away from Fanny ; their table tilted and blurred , there was a loud buzzing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rob 's hand came over hers . " It has to conic to that , " said Rob , " has n't it ? " In this new bedroom at the Villa Fiorita Fanny had sat looking at the two rings in her hand until , " They are to wear , " said Rob behind her . He had come in so quietly that she had not heard him and , for once , not sensed him . " Put them on . " 43 " You mean . . . because of Celestina ? " said Fanny . " Because of us . " Rob had blazed at her so fiercely that she shrank . " I 'm sorry , " said Rob . He knelt down beside her . " But sometimes I think you will never understand . I have waited nearly a year , " said Rob . " Each day was a year . This last month was twenty , and then this interminable day . " " The day 's nearly over . " She tried to speak lightly . " Look , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want it to go now , " said Rob . " It 's just beginning . " He had his face against her hair . " Your hair smells like a child 's , honey and satin . " " It 's beginning to be grey . " " Then it is n't a child 's , thank God , " and sensing her trouble he moved to look into her face . " What is the mat-ter ? " " Rob , should n't we keep the wedding ring until . . . " " Until ? " " We really are married . " She knew he would say what she would say herself in strict reasoning : " Can some words that a little man will say over us make us any more marriedthan we are ? " They should not , but mysteriously they will , thought Fanny . Rob was laughing at her  --  because he refuses to be disturbed , thought Fanny , and she freed herself from his arm . He stood up , taking out a cigarette . " It 's a little late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said but Fanny looked up at him in the mirror , still troubled . " Would n't it be more honest ? " " No . " The laughter had gone , leaving his face and eyes purposely expressionless , a mask that she had seen him44put on for other people . " Honest ? " he asked smoothly  --  and when Rob was smooth it meant he was angry . " If you are thinking on those lines , honesty has gone . " " How gone ? " " If a public promise , before witnesses , to put it at its least , makes all that difference to you , I have to remind you , you have already given that promise to Darrell . " " This , this is my Hugh , " said Fanny , her face lit with happiness and triumph . She and Rob were on the veranda of the hotel at San Vigilio , finishing their dinner. ' i'he Nettuno was moored at the jetty and in the dusk small fishing boats were moving out , each with its searchlightshining down into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the fishes moved . A man stood in each boat moving the oars , while another knelt to cast and draw in the nets . The veranda was dimly lit , its orange-red walls seemed to glow ; they made Fanny 's skin , so much browner now , look warm , her hair a deeper bronze . She had a flush on her cheeks . Rob had never seen her look prettier . " What was Mother like ? " In the flat , Caddie , wrinkling up her forehead to try and remember , had asked that . None of them were sure , though Philippa began to embroider . " Her hair is nut-brown , " she had said . " Nuts can be all kinds of brown , " said Hugh . He did not want to discuss Fanny . " I mean red-brown . Her eyes are the colour of sherry . " " Sherry can be anything from dark brown to pale gold . " 45 " Her eyes are not pale gold , " said Caddie . Only Topaz 's eyes were gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new admiration for her mother . " She 's big and soft , " said Caddie . " You make her sound like a sofa or a pillow , " but Fanny was soft , soft to lean against , and Caddie 's eyes had stung so that she had to trace out the pattern of the chintz on the armchair , to stop tears spilling over . " Caddie is always brimming , " said Hugh . Fanny had thought she knew what she was like  --  like any of the others who lived in Whitcross , she would have said . It seemed to her now that they had been almost identical , " Peas in a pod , " she told Rob . " I , or Anthea , or Margot , or Molly Ferguson , Pam Winter , or Charmian . We dressed the same , in tweeds , a cardigan or jersey jacket , a string of pearls , cultured or very small  --  except Anthea 's ; we wore good stockings , a little thick , and flat shoes . We talked the same , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-pitched carrying voice , " objected Rob . " We lived the same , in houses a little shabby but gracious , with Regencywallpapers or panelling , chintzes , bowls of flowers . Our children went to much the same boarding schools , the younger ones to the same small private day school . We drove them there and back and those of us who had n't two cars drove our husbands to and from the station ; in fact we were perpetual chauffeurs . We all had dogs , most of our children had ponies . We had accounts at Harrods , Debenham and Freebody 's , a few of us at Fortnum 's . We gave the same parties , mostly children 's or for drinks , but46Anthea 's and Margot 's were more ambitious ; for instance I should never have thought of asking you to dinner , " Fanny told Rob . " In the holidays we were so busy we scarcely had time to exchange a word and the driving wasi really hard work . Children are supposed to keep you young , " said Fanny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holidays , I felt old , almost worn out . We were critical of each other , especially behind one another 's backs , but if any of us were ill or in trouble , we all helped as a matter of course . We were almost sisters , which is why . . . " And Fanny broke off . Then , " Anthea was the most important , " she said . " You saw that when you were shooting in the Big House park . " They always called Whitcross Park the Big House . " Anthea went to the Palace , did things the rest of us could n't . Margot was the clever one and the most sophisticated . She really knew about the theatre and films . " " God deliver me , " said Rob . " Charmian had a tongue . Pam was a darling . Everybodyloved her . " " Did n't they you ? " " I was separate , even then , " said Fanny slowly . " Quieter . Perhaps it was that I had to do things by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman out . Besides I was n't interesting . Everyone knew everything about me and I suppose I did n't think much about myself . That 's not being virtuous , " she told Rob . " It 's just that there was nothing to think about until . . . " She had lost that unconsciousness . Nowadays she was alwayslooking at herself in the mirror , but perhaps not as much with vanity , as with questioning wonder . " I am47forty-three . I have had three children , one almost grown up . My waist will never be truly slim again . I have wrinklesat the corners of my eyes "  --  she could have called them crinkles , but , " Wrinkles " said Fanny firmly , nipping off all illusions . " My eyes still look like Caddie 's and my nose is straight , and I have kept my skin , that 's from what Margot would call innocent living , but I am large , my mouth is too wide and my forehead is wide too , rather than high , which is supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I have n't any presence , " but , " I saw you in your village shop , " said Rob , " and I thought you were sweet . " If Margot had said that it would have been derogatory , but Rob meant sweet as a good apple is sweet , sweet and sound . " That 's the kind of wife I want , " said Rob . " But you could have had someone exciting . " " My work is exciting , " said Rob , " I need rest . " He loved to dine with her like this , to look at her across the table , but tonight there was a change . She was not alone with him , absorbed , content , as she had always been . There had always been other people in the room , of course , people round them , beside them  --  but not between us , thought Rob . I suppose it was too much to hope that this could last . They say a female animal changes completely when she has young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air of quiet management about Fanny that irritatedhim . Silently he poured out her wine . " It hurts that they had to do it at all , " but Fanny did not sound hurt , she sounded happy and gratified . " Darrell can never say again that Hugh has n't guts . For a boy just fourteen to plan and face all that . " 4 8 " He had Caddie with him , " Rob pointed out but Fanny was intent on Hugh . " He always took my side , " she said , triumphant again . " Did you take sides ? " asked Rob . " That strikes me as disloyal . " " Darrell did n't understand Hugh , " and Rob remembered how her eyes had shone with pride and love as she had turned Hugh towards him on the terrace . " Rob , this is Hugh . " " I knew Hugh would n't stay with him . I knew it , " said Fanny . " He has to stay with him , " said Rob . " It would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Encourage him ? " There was a distinct bristling in Fanny 's voice . " How encourage him ? " " Making them feel too welcome . I know it 's hard but " Is that why you rubbed it in about not being expected ? " The bristling was unmistakable now . " I thought that was unkind . " " Not unkind , it was sense . " " But of course I welcomed them , " said Fanny . " Childrenare always welcome , where their mother is . Always . " " At any time ? " asked Rob . " At any time . " Fanny lifted her chin at him in a way he was beginning to know . " Does that sound wrong to you ? " " It sounds false , " said Rob . " No one , however near and dear , is welcome at any time , " and he said roughly , " Be yourself , Fanny . " " I am myself . This is me . " " It 's not . It 's a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was pricking silence between49them until she began to talk about San Vigilio , its famous old hotel keeper , and the chapel that was open once a year in the count 's villa . Rob knew by the lightness of her voice that he had hurt her and presently he leant over , took her hand , and kissed it . The forced talk stopped at once , but with the coffee he had to go back to it . " You know , dear , no matter what our feelings are , they must go back . We must telegraph Darrell . It 's only fair . " " Yes , but not tonight . " " Tonight . We can call in at Malcesine . We have to , Fanny dear . " When the Nettuno turned into the small walled harbour , Fanny stayed in the boat watching the waterfront lights while Rob went to send the telegram from the little cafe that was the town 's public call office . When he came back he looked at her as if he thought she might hold this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down next to Salvatore , the young boatman who owned and drove the Nettuno , she moved closer and slid her hand insideRob 's arm . The children are not to turn into an argumentbetween us , they are not to , thought Fanny . The lake had never been more beautiful ; it was still as a pool , its mountains dark against the sky ; only their snow glimmered , as the foam glimmered in the wash behind the Nettuno . The lights in the villages and towns had been put out , only a few were strung out along the shore , or one shone here and there like a firefly on the mountain . The Nettuno 's prow broke up the reflections of the stars in the water  --  because they are only reflections ? asked Fanny and caught herself back . She would not think any more contentiousthoughts tonight . Indeed , she felt blessed more5 0than she deserved ; to have Rob and this warm triumph in her heart : " They ran away . They ran away to me . " The Nettuno @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died and in the sudden lull Salvatore sent the rope flying ; it fell neatly round the post and they came alongside . They were back at the sleeping villa . IIII T WAS N O T Rob 's villa , nor was the Nettuno his . " Great Jehoshophat , I 'm not as rich as that , " he would have said , though for Hugh and Caddie he remained immenselyrich forever . The villa belonged to Madame Menghini , Renato Menghini 's aunt . The Menghini were , it appeared , an even bigger clan than Celestina 's , whose relations peopled the village , let the camping sites , ran the kitchen of the Hotel Lydia , owned the trattoria and many of the farms up the mountain . Celestina 's cousins and uncles and aunts were in almost every shop in Malcesine , " Every shop with which we deal , " said Rob , but , " We are a cadet branch of the famousMenghini , " Madame Menghini liked to say . " They have a palace in Riva . " Renato Menghini had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Think of it , he came to Whitcross , " said Fanny . One of Renato 's uncles and his grandmother had helped to finance Haysel to Harvest and in this crisis Rob , between pictures , had asked Renato if he could find a house somewhere in Italy where he and Fanny could go . " We are better out of England for the next three months . " Renato had immediately delved among his rela-52tions and come up with this aunt . " She is French-English , " he said , which , now she was a widow , was why she liked to be called Madame Menghini , not Signora Menghini . " But . . . turn her out of her house ? " Fanny had said . " She has three , " said Renato gently . " One on Garda , one in Genoa , one in Milan . " He had driven out from Milan to see that everything was in order and to greet Rob and Fanny . His bright brown eyes slid away from Fanny and looked at her again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them both . " She often lets one or other of her houses , " he explained . The Villa Fiorita was her holiday home . All the villas on these north Italian lakes , Garda , Como , Maggiore , Iseo , had been built for holidays ; for mountain air , sailing , sun-bathing , relaxation , peace . Renato told Fanny that Garda , because of its winds , was never as sizzlingly hot as most of Italy can be ; every morning brought the tramontana , " the wind from the mountains " that the people called simply , the vento ; in the afternoon it changed to the ora , which blew from the south but in early spring could be so fierce that it was deadly to the orange and lemon blossoms . Because the lake was so far north , Garda was not as popular  --  " Thank God , " said Renato -- as the more flowery and accessible Como and Maggiore , though tourists came to it all summer long , driving down to Riva over the Brenner pass , coming in from Milan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riviera too , stretching from Gardone to Salo on the western side , and famous Sirmione 's narrow peninsula under the ruins of Catullus 's villa . Here were the big hotels . the Excelsiors , Grands , Imperials , and53Splendides with their Edwardian-sized rooms , marble pillars , and marble floors . At the north end of the lake the villas and gardens were smaller , hotels more modest with more modest names : Hotel Alpina , Primula , Claudia , Lydia . Here were campingsites in the olive groves  --  campers were far more profitablethan olives  --  with little pebbled beaches and wooden jetties ; there were canteen bars , communal washrooms , trattorias . In the villages the stands of oranges and lemons were smaller , most were sold from the road wall , by children . The steamers , so busy down the southern end , and the aliscafo , that lifted out of the water on two red wings , did not call anywhere on the eastern shore after Malcesine , but went straight to Riva at the head of the lake or across to Limone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of the fishermen wore yachting caps as they did in the tourist towns ; none of them had clubbed together to buy a Nettuno . There were no gift shops until the road reached Torbole . The villa was on this quieter shore , two kilometres above Malcesine . Madame Menghini , Renato told them , had bought the land and built the house long ago when land on Garda was cheap . Now a small camping site in a lakeside olive grove sold at four thousand pounds . Then , the roads were not built , the occidentale and orientale roads that bordered the west and east sides of the lake , cuttingless lucky villa gardens in two , running behind the little fishing towns and tunnelling under the mountains where these came down sheer to the shore . " We have no railways here , " said Renato . " Once the only way between54most towns and villages was by boat . The people were primitivethen , as they still are back in the hills . They lived off their fish , fruit and vines and olives ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Renato , his brown eyes twinkling . " We are not tourists , we are staying , " said Fanny . " All the English like to say that , " said Renato . Malcesine was one of the smaller towns , almost a fishingvillage , topped by an old red stone castle that went back to the thirteenth century . The castle was deserted now , Malcesine had grown but it had kept its small harbourand its steep cobbled streets . They were so narrow that the house roofs almost met overhead , with hardly room to hang a line of washing across , or a string of peppers , or put out a birdcage . Firewood and the wicker damigiana of wine , loads of vegetables and groceries , had to be taken up or down on wooden-runnered sleighs , drawn by mules . All the streets ran down to the lake ; its blue could be seen at every turn and they teemed with life . Besides the grocers and wine shops , the bread shops , confectioners , and the green grocers that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their potatoes and salads , there were gift shops hung with scarves and ties from the silk mills at Como ; they had copper from Toscana , Venetianglass , Austrian embroideries , model galleons carved from horn , and everywhere , in every shop , postcards . Every ferry boat brought crowds ; the cafe tables under the oleanderswere always crowded . Every half-hour a speedboat backed out of the little harbour where the fishing boats knocked against the old stone walls , and took a load of55tourists out onto the lake . Though they paid several millionlire for their boats Salvatore and his friends made a golden harvest . To the tourists , the great blue lake probably seemed a place to be looked at rather than lived in ; the villa , if they passed it on the lake , seemed a facade with its yellow walls , painted eaves , and tumbling roses . If , in the evenings , they strolled as far as the gates , all they could see were the old olives in their grove , a glimpse of flowers beyond , cypresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whitethorn . " If they were not there , " said Renato , " you would have Germans picnicking in the garden , or on the front steps . " The open back road only led to the boathouse . " Villa Fiorita , " they would read , in the gilt letters . Fiorita would have been a usual name on Como or Maggiore , where azalea and camellia bushes grew as large as trees , where every flower was lush ; here , in the Garda winds , it was a struggle to grow flowers at all but Madame Menghini , with her English strain , had been a gardener ; she had sent down as far as Naples for rare bushes and flowering trees , to England and to Paris . In the old days when she could keep the villa up and had two gardeners , not Giacomino asleep under the olives or sunninghimself on a wall , with only an occasional hand from Mario , who was boatman , handyman , chauffeur , fisher , the garden had been famous up and down the lake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown into tangles , bushes been choked and Celestina 's chickens had scratched up the beds . " But it is still Fiorita , " said Fanny . " Flowering peace and stillness . " It was strange that it should have felt so still because the5 6first few days were cold and stormy . Fanny had always thought of Italy as sun-drenched , warm , hot , lazy , but now rain and wind hurled themselves across the lake , the vento blowing all day long . " Two metres of snow on the Brenner , " said Rob , " and it 's nearly Easter ! " The villa on its point caught the full force of the wind which shrieked down the chimney ; every room was filled with the clatteringof the shutters as they shook and rattled . Though there were double doors and windows  --  " Now we know why , " said Rob draughts whistled across the floor , lifting the rugs and turning feet to ice . Outside in the garden , the flowers were dashed headlong , and lay in soaked masses ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made more silver by the rain ; rain dripped from the hedges , and the cypresses bent and twisted into such loops that Fanny thought they must snap . The mountains were hidden in cloud , and the lake as far as they could see it was white with breakers . Yet under the waves , the water still kept its blue , as mysteriously intrinsic as if the lake were a jewel that held its own colour . How , when the sky was grey ? " That is Garda fame , " Celestina told Fanny . Celestina had once spent a year in England . " When me young , " said Celestina , " come Giulietta . Very good England . Molto bella l'Inghilterra . Oxforrd Street . Peecadilly . " She spoke a little English but often German words crept in and she did not know which was which . Celestina was , she said , shamed by the weather . " A prile , Maggio , bestestmonths . Schon . Schon , " she said regretfully but , to Fanny , the tempest outside only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Giulietta were united in worrying57in case she was uncomfortable , cold , depressed . Here Fanny was first and for years she had always been last ; the last to be served  --  " Because I did the serving "  --  the last to go to bed , unless Darrell were at home , but first to get up in the morning , she thought wryly . She was last on every list and automatically the one to give up everything , to stay behind , to go without . " Well , mothers are like that , " she would have said . " Some mothers , " said Rob . Now Rob made her stay in bed for breakfast and Celestinapanted up the stairs with relays of coffee , while Giulietta , strong and nimble as a goat , carried up the breakfasttable so that Rob could eat with Fanny . In the sitting room Giulietta built a big fire of olive wood that gave out its warm incense : Rob and Fanny sat by it , reading , talking  --  ordreaming , thought Fanny , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work for three months , " Rob had said . They had drinks before lunch which always began with one of Celestina 's pastas , gnocchi , cannelloni , ravioli , or with shrimps , fresh caught in the Adriatic or the new season 's asparagus . Afterwards Fanny rested , Rob wrote letters and then in raincoats , scarves , thick shoes , they would walk down to Malcesine to buy stamps and get English papers , or up the mountain into the storm , past dripping terraces of olives and vines and steep peach orchardswhere the pink blossoms shone in the rain . The farms seemed to be of goats and bantams . " I have n't seen a sheep or a pig , scarcely any cows , " said Fanny . Perhaps the cows were not let out yet to graze in the meagre pastures . Fanny and Rob came in soaked , battered , but glowing , and Fanny made tea ; there was no kettle in the villa but she went into the kitchen and used a strange little58electric pan of Celestina 's that held only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she discovered , was fussy about tea . It had to be China , his special brand of Lapsang Souchong ; she began to appreciate its fine and smoky taste . At teatime the post came and this was a dangerous moment ; there was scarcely ever a letter for her but Rob read his aloud . " You must begin to understand , " he said . Now too they read the papers , " From a far-off world , " said Fanny . Then Fanny went up for a bath ; the hot water trickled so that she had to allow half an hour for it to run in but she would fill the tub , add the pine and balsam essenceRob had bought for her , and lie soaking . She would dress leisurely and come down to find the fire heaped up , drinks ready on a trolley and she and Rob would talk again until Giulietta , who was as sudden as Celestina , would burst open the glass doors and call , " A tavola , " and they would dine at the round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat far too much , " said Fanny . The villa had no radio , television , or telephone . " You will have absolute quiet and peace , " Renato had said , and after dinner Rob read aloud . He had bought a case of new novels and biographies but now he read Fanny a **26;4689;TOOLONG he was bewitched with , a story of Saladinthat he hoped one day to make into a picture . " I see it as a film opera , " he said  --  Margot had told Fanny he alwayswrote his own scripts . " I have been trying to get backing , and so has Renato , for three years . " It had always been Fanny who had read aloud , endlessly she thought ; now she sat idle , gazing into the olive fire , listening to his voice against the storm . The dark came early and they went early to bed , leaving59the fire burning . Its warm smell would drift up the stairs , seeming to warm the bedroom if they left the brocade door open . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only lulled the house further into sleep . The Villa Fiorita had opened a new world to Fanny with its chosen antique furniture , the tapestries and brocadeshung on the walls . " I did n't know everyday houses had them , " Fanny said as Caddie might have done . There were endless bibelots ; glass bowls , goblets , and tear bottles ; snuff boxes , family portraits , two especially that Fanny loved , a man and woman , Huguenot in their primness , with dark clothes and ruffs . There was the pair of angelsthat were to impress Caddie . Fanny 's bedroom with the gilt and brocade bed , the pink and cream furniture , was for someone feminine , loved , thought Fanny , and precious . She had never thought of herself as precious before . It was as if the frontiers of her old world had been opened , giving a bigger view of a wider world , at the same time more cultivated and more careless . " But . . . is n't there an inventory ? " she had asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , silver left to strangers . " My aunt either leaves everything or puts everything away , " Renato had explained . There was a compliment in that but he did not add that , in any case , the inventory was there , in Celestina 's head . Every article in the villa was listed there and who would dare to dispute with Celestina ? Not even the German generals who had occupied the villa in the war , not even the Egyptian prince whose servants had been light-fingered . " Twenty thousand lire compensationthey had to pay , " said Celestina . Madame Menghini 's bookshelves made Fanny feel a6 oschool girl , books in French , German , Italian , English . Many of them were written in by the authors , some of them were dedicated to Madame as well . There was a rich ; abundance of books as there was of flowers : pot plants of begonias , crimson , salmon , lemon yellow , white ; begonias by the dozen , azaleas , hydrangeas . There was a new vista , too , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace , and simplicity , thought Fanny and she thought of all the years she had spent in endless , and what seemed here needless , cooking ; porridge , bacon and eggs for breakfast  --  t hough , as she soon learned , no meal is more envied in Italy than English breakfasts  --  but all those puddings , thought Fanny , daily potatoes , cakes and scones for tea and all the other tea : early morning tea ; kitchen elevenses , tea for workmen come into the house , tea , tea , tea ; no wonder at titcbbings there was never any time ; but , though the villa was a revelation , Fanny was still Fanny and a subtle change began to come over it ; the chairs no longer stood st iflly round the centre table ; two were by the fire , a rug moved between them , a table of books pulled out beside theist . Fanny would pick up the cushions and throw them back in the chairs after Giulietta had set them in careful triangles . Papers and books were left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rows . The small gauze curtains that had been stretched across every window , shutting out the view , had come down , and the crocheted mats that Celestina felt should be under every vase , ashtray , and ornament , disappeared . It was as if Fanny had shaken the villa into comfortable living , and Rob looked round and said , " I do n't know what you have done , but it 's different  --  as I am. " 6 iThat was true . How could such a difference come in so short a time ? But it had . Rob looked as if he had been . . . crowned , thought Fanny . " Well , this is the first time I have ever had a woman of my own , " said Rob . " Someone on every picture , " Margot had said . Fanny could disregard , now , the pang that that had given her . She knew it was not true . " Most film people are very much family men , " Rob had said . " I was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , remembering that far-off girl wife , whom Rob had only talked about once , and briefly . " Lucia was a child . She made me feel guilty . " The moodiness came back , the look that had made Philippa say Rob looked melancholy and Margot declare he was unhappy , a hollow look . Then his face cleared . " I ought to feel guilty about you but I do n't . I ca n't . " The hollowness had gone ; he looked fulfilled ; his eyes had a spark , not only of amusement but of a happiness that spilled over . And I have done that , thought Fanny . They had been ten days in the villa when they woke to a new silence . For a moment they did not know what it meant ; the wind had dropped ; there was no blustering round the house ; the shutters were not rattling and from the garden came only the sound of waves lazily lapping . Fanny jumped up to open the windows ; the lake was a deep iridescent blue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; their blue and pumice heights were lit with sun , their caps of snow shone . Now , so early in the morning , the sky arched pale ; presently it , too , 6 2would be that postcard Italian blue and soon the sun was streaming across the lake . It was now , when they could have been outside all day , that Rob started to work . I t began with a telegram from Renato : " Telephone me , Milan 22306 . " " I can guess what that is , " said Rob . " A picture ? " asked Fanny . " Yes , but I ca n't do anything about it . " " But Rob , if it 's Saladin , you must . " " It wo n't be Saladin , and this time belongs to us . I deservea rest , " said Rob . " Eleven months on Haysel to Harvest , seven in Africa and Rome with Diamond Pipe , and more to come on that . It 's slavery . I am spending this time with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't if it 's something interesting . " " Indeed I can . " " You said that in your life you have to take what comes when it comes , " said Fanny . " You said one ca n't dictate to work . We are going in to Malcesine to ring up Renato . " The cafe public telephone was behind the harbour in a narrow busy street , where the traffic made it difficult to hear . The woman behind the bar dealt with the numbers ; she put Rob through , while he waited by one of the booths , patiently , but tapping his foot and talking to the cafe childrenwhile Fanny sat at one of the tables . She avoided all children : indeed she had asked Rob to tell Celestina that the trattoria children were not to play in the garden . " Proibire ai bambini di venire qui ! " said Celestina . The Signora , so kind and gentle , not to like children ! Not to want Beppino and Gianna ! But now in the cafe she could not help watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's age , proudly playing with his tiny sister . Fanny watched his rough head bent over the little dark one as he teased in a voice that squeaked suddenly on a high note and went down ; a breakingvoice always made them seem more vulnerable , thought Fanny , and hastily turned away . Even the little girl had shades : Philippa at that age had none of the meltingsweetness of this little Italian , but had been direct , fierce , with a fall of golden hair , clearly marked eyebrows and an imperious mouth . She still had them . My beautiful Flip , thought Fanny . Hugh . . . The thought of him followedthough she tried to shut it out . Often to her , Hugh was still at the fledgling stage that little boys go through when they have big downy heads , skins more delicate than a girl 's , long lashes ; but Hugh was as old as this boy now , at the thorny , unmanageable stage . She could imagine how difficult he was being and Fanny hastily turned to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less , more or less because she was in the nebulous incognito of ten to thirteen when a girl might be any age  --  or anyone , thought Fanny  --  and Caddie was surely more nebulousthan most because she was so hopelessly shy , as I was , thought Fanny . Yet Caddie was braver than her mother ; she had not been at all shy over Topaz , for instance . She was to have ridden him in Risborough Show , thought Fanny . The letters from Dartmoor had been all about that , nothing of Caddie , only of Topaz . His first show . . . Here Fanny had to tell herself to sit up straight , drink her coffee . How absurd , with all the major things she had left undone , to feel such a pang over Caddie 's pony . It was bet-64ter , much better not to think of the children , not to look at the cafe children . She got up sharply and went into the booth with Rob . She listened to the short sharp sentences . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all for three months . Damn it all , we agreed , Renato . " She could hear the loud Italian voice crackling and talking on the other end , it sounded both urgent and excited . " It is Saladin , " said Rob to Fanny . " Saladin ! Oh Rob ! " " Yes , I know , " said Rob into the receiver . " Yes I did . I have always wanted to . I went over it all with Herz last year , as you know . Does it have to be now ? Then it 's no . ' " " I am going to spend this time with you , " he said again to Fanny . " You have wanted to do this for years , and I wo n't run away . " Fanny was calm and decided . In spite of everything Rob was saying , she could feel his excitement and she took the receiver from him . " Signor Menghini . " " Yes . Is that . . . " He does n't know what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to call herself . " Yes . This is Fanny , " she said . " Signor Menghini , Rob is to do this picture . " " You say so ? " There was approval as well as amusement in his voice . " Yes , " said Fanny . " They want a breakdown by June , " said Rob . " That 's almost impossible . " " You can do it , " said Fanny and down the telephone to Renato , " He is standing beside me waiting to talk reasonablyto you , " and she gave the receiver back to Rob. 6 5The call went on . " No , I 'm not coming to them . No , of course they ca n't come here . They can wait . It will take a month at least , to get an outline . No I wo n't . Not even to Milan . " " And he went to Milan and stayed three days , " said Fanny . Rob took the small south bedroom as his study ; shut away behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cell , sunny and quiet . " Do n't you want a view ? " asked Fanny . " No , I want four walls , " said Rob . " A desk ? " Fanny had looked round Madame Menghini 's furniture . In the drawing room there was a desk of walnut inlaid with painted wood and gilt . It did not look a desk for work , but , " There is n't another , " said Fanny . " I do n't want a desk , I want a table , " Rob had said , and had taken the kitchen table that was to shock the children . It shocked Fanny too . " Because it looks incongruous ? " asked Rob . It was not that . To take the kitchen table was , for Fanny , to upset the whole order of a home . " Quite hopelesslydomestic , " Margot used often to say of Fanny . " I like being domestic , " Fanny had countered unperturbed and now , " What will Celestina do ? " she asked wide-eyed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was part of the new carelessness ; order , as Fanny knew it , had vanished . " Do n't call me for lunch , " said Rob . " But you must eat . " " I will have something when I have finished . " " You could go on after lunch . " " I could n't , " said Rob . " To start once is bad enough . To start twice would be murder . " 66 " But do n't you want to work ? " " Of course , " said Rob . " Why not ? " " You must have something to eat , all those hours . " " Giulietta can bring me a panino "  --  a panino was an Italian sandwich , a cut roll with ham or salami clapped insideit . " Giulietta , not you , " said Rob . " That 's not very flattering . " " It is . I do n't notice Giulietta . Fanny , if you love me , leave me alone . " It was the first time that Fanny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , before anything ; before eating or drinking , before sleeping . She had thought Darrell , in the Army , and as a Messenger , had worked hard ; but lie had hours , defined times , time when he left off , was free  --  though of course he had sometimes to fill in for other people , leave unexpectedly . Often Rob would work the whole day through shut in the study , though sometimes he was restless and needed to rove ; he would spend an hour standing on the point , looking into the ripples , or sending pebbles skimming across the lake ; he would pace in the garden . Fanny learned not to speak to him or notice him . She kept herself apart . " Brit what about you ? " Rob had asked when he started on the breakdown , " What will you do alone for hours ? " " What you told me to do , " said Fanny , " nothing . " She had all this time flagged behind Rob ; she could not get over her tiredness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas , " she might have said . First the children to school , packing them for the last time ; I knew that though they did n't . Then Stebbings , when only Gwyneth understoodthe reason . " Giving up Stebbings ? For a flat in Lon-67don ! Fanny , you are mad , " Margot and Anthea had cried . They knew now what lay behind Fanny 's quiet , " It will be easier for Darrell . " Then up in Scotland packing up Aunt Isabel 's cottage , the small bleak grey stone house with its dark yews . It was strange that it should all have come together , thought Fanny : Aunt Isabel 's where I had lived as a child , that was my home up to my marriage ; Stebbings , and the children . I was packing my whole life away . No wonder I am tired . Rob had been shocked by her thinness . " I was shocked at yours , " said Fanny . " I have always been thin . You should be plump , and I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he went up to work , Rob would carry out a long chair and cushions onto the terrace and Fanny would spend the morning there , lying in the sun , growing together again , thought Fanny , as one can grow no matter how one has been torn . After Renato had left them in the garden that first evening , Fanny had gone across the grass and wonderingly touched one of the old olive trees . Its roots had lifted lumps of earth in the grass ; it was split halfway up its length , twisted out of shape , the trunk showing dry and pale where it was holed , but it still bore its crown of leaves , the olive leaves that blow now green , now silver in the wind and that she would come to love . The old damagedtree would have a crop of olives , year after year , silentlyfruiting , and  --  I have been making a clamour , thought Fanny suddenly . The only sounds that came here were from the road or lake and none of them were anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took his boat out , wet clothes were slapped on wooden washboards from the villa 's own beach or from the hotel foreshore as Giulietta or the villagewomen or the hotel 's two maids did the washing . " We do n't have many laundries in Italy , " Renato had told her . There was a spluttering , now and then , from an outboard motor , the grander rush of a speedboat and , every hour or so , the distant churning of the steamers on their way from Riva to Limone , Limone to Malcesine . Sometimes greetings were called across the water ; Celestina 's voice rang out as she shouted to Giacomino or to Giulietta , or the postwoman or the butcher in his white apron with his napkin-covered basket , or to the old milkwoman who wore the black and brown striped skirt , black shawl , and kerchiefof the peasant women and brought the milk in old wine bottles , " Open to all the dust , " said Fanny . " Not very hygienic , " said Rob , " but Madame Menghini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive and well . " At Stebbings everything had concerned Fanny ; here she could not even understand what was said and she was concerned in none of it . She had not ordered the meat , or the milk . Celestina did the housekeeping . Traffic on the road made a continual hum . Rob complainedthat there were too many cars but to Fanny it was only a distant drone ; the olive grove lay between and even the maddening scooter explosions sank to a faint whine . With the advent of the little cars there were , Rob said , far fewer scooters . The bus horn made its two notes every four hours , but Fanny need never catch that bus . Morning , midday , evening , if the wind were not too fierce , she heard the bells . Each village had its fine church6gwith a turret roofed with brown tiles , a wide piazza , an interior of paintings and marbles . The churches seemed too big and grandiose for villages , but , " See them on Sundays , " said Rob . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes she heard only the one from Malcesinebut they seemed to measure off the hours into peace and stillness . When they sounded at midday , Celestina would send Giulietta out to lay Fanny 's lunch outside on the stone table . The pink stone bench was sunbaked by twelve o'clock . Often Celestina would bring the coffee herself and stay to talk in her broken English , German , in the midst of much Italian and dramatic mime . Fanny could have learned a great deal about Celestina 's family , about Celestina'slife in the war , Celestina 's marriage , but as she listened with one ear she let it slide out of the other . Celestinawas not Fanny 's business . After lunch she would sleep , often on the grass under the cypresses that made another private little garden above the villa 's beach . She would listen to the lapping of the waves until she fell asleep . " You look as if you had n't slept for months , " Rob told Fanny . " I did n't . " " You can sleep now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been so many nights spent penned in Stebbings , or pacing the floor of her narrow old room at Aunt Isabel 's , or unable to sleep because of the stuffiness of the London hotels , and Fanny slept as if she were drugged . When she woke , often she would go out in the car . It was70a new delight to drive Rob 's Mercedes after years of the old Rover . At first Rob had been anxious . " Will you remember to keep on the right ? And Italians drive fast , " but Fanny had laughed . " I have been a chauffeur more than half my life . " " Far too much of a chauffeur , " said Rob . It was a new experience for Fanny not to be allowed to drive when she was tired . In those afternoons she drove up the lake to Riva , the little town with its mountain-locked harbours where weepingwillows swept their fronds into the water , and roses even climbed up the lamp posts . It had good shops in the streets around the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tintoria where a row of young girls stood at their ironing boards , ready to press clothes while the customer waited , and the doors were kept open because of the fumes of the dry-cleaning machine , so that the chatter of voices came out into the street . She would drive down to Malcesine to buy newspapers or go into the post office for Rob , then sit outside one of the cafes on the quay side , drinking coffee or eating an orange ice and watching the steamers come in , the slow and the aliscafo with its twonotehorn . The motorboatmen , headed by Salvatore , grew to know her as they already knew Rob ; she talked to his favourite waitress , Rita , little and swarthy in her black , with a tiny immaculate apron that hid the cloth pouch of change money . Fanny knew the hotel porters , who were always outside their hotels , bowing invitingly to every car ; she knew the car-park man , whom Rob called the Bandit , as she knew the police , the carabanieri , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their71cocked hats , swords , and snow-white gloves . Now and again she would come on a procession of toddlers , little boys , pale-faced , in blue pinafores and peaked caps , from the Colonia Infantile to which children were brought from the slums of Milan ; every day they paraded solemnly down to the harbour , walking two by two , each child holdingon to the tail of the pinafore of the one in front . Fanny always walked quickly past them , as she walked past the children playing in the piazza , the babies feeding the pigeons on the steps of the church . Sometimes she would drive farther , right down the lake , past the little harboured towns with their pink stone or stuccoed houses , their olives , cypresses , and oleanders , their stalls of oranges and lemons : Torri , Bardolino with its vineyards , Lazise with another old red castle , Garda , so much smaller than one expected of the lake 's name town , right down to Peschiera . " Would n't you like to see Verona , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fanny seemed held to the lake ; she had a feeling she would break the magic of their contentmentif she went out of sight of its blue , and no matter where she had been , she was always back in time for Rob , and it was always with a quickening of her heart that she came round the last bend of the lake road and saw the villa cypresses serried above the water , the lights on in the kitchen and in Rob 's window above . She would drive in through the gates , turn behind the flowering thorns , leave the car for Mario to put away , and go silently up to her room to bathe , change , and wait in the sitting room or on the terrace until Rob came down . This was the time she loved best , to sit , or walk with72him in the twilight , when the mountains opposite grew dark , their edges sharp as black-green paper cuts against the sky . Clouds , still bright with sunset , were reflected in the lake which slowly withdrew into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There would be an occasionallight , red or green , from a passing steamer ; or a fishing boat 's headlamp would make a spark , small and lonely on the lake 's width . There was always one star , directlyopposite , as if it were hung there for the villa . " It 's the evening star , " said Fanny , but it seemed their star . It shone with such intensity that a spear of light was thrown across the water almost to their feet , but the star always dropped below the mountain with extraordinary swiftness . Then the familiar beaded lights began to appear along the shore , and in clusters on the mountain . Car headlights made white flares in and out of the tunnels on the occidentale , the lake road opposite , or came on unknowntwisted ways down from the mountains . " Time to go in , " Rob would say . " I 'm starving  --  and burning for a drink . " It was a pattern of sun , quiet , work , and slowly Fanny began to unwind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting my heart in two , thought Fanny  --  was loosening . One day I might even be whole again , almost , thought Fanny . When she lay in the garden in the sun and shut her eyes , the light shone through her lids and it was scarlet . Was that symbolical ? " But it was not like that , " she could have cried . She had only to open her eyes and the light was clear , gold , warm , " And that is reality . I ca n't go on being haunted forever , " said Fanny. 73 " Men do n't like tears . " She could imagine Madame Menghini saying that . Women , in Edwardian days , may have been hypocrites but they kept their faces and they had backbone ; " And so must you , " Fanny told herself sternly . " Now you can do this : untangle the thread of all this , follow it through for the last time . Then wind it all up in a ball that you can keep hidden in your hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more . You can tell it all out , " said Fanny , " from the beginning . " IVI T HAD BEEN the last Sunday in May  --  nearly a year ago , thought Fanny , only a year , for all this !  --  she had dropped in at the Davenants ' house in Whitcross to take back a book ; Margot had most of the new books and was generous in lending them . " Anthea 's here , " Margot had said . " She has brought some of the film people . They have a scene about a poacher and they wanted Sydney 's advice . " Sydney , Margot 's husband , was a Justice of the Peace . " They are in the garden now . Come out and you shall meet Rob Quillet . " She spoke as if she were conferring a royal favour but , from the French doors that led out from the drawing room , Fanny looked at the thin dark man talking to Sydney , and , " Is that Rob Quillet ? " she asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Where ? " and , " Where could you meet him ? " asked Anthea . The surprise was as unflattering as was the emphasis on the " you " but Fanny was used to Margot and Anthea , and , " I met him in Derrick 's shop , " she said . " You remember Geoff Derrick had his tonsils out . " " What in the world have Geoff Derrick 's tonsils to do75with Rob Quillet ? " " Everything , " Fanny could have said now . It was one of those chance winds  --  or not " chance , " thought Fanny . Geoff did the deliveries for Derrick 's shop all over Whitcross , and , " While he was in hospital , we had to fetch our groceries ourselves , " said Fanny . Hers had made two large boxes on the counter . " Can you manage ? " asked Mrs. Derrick and a stranger looking at the stands of flower seeds had turned and said , " Those are too heavy for you . Let me carry them . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fanny told Rob . " Those are too heavy for you . " She had given Rob a fleeting smile , said , " That 's very kind of you , " and led the way to the Rover . " I can remember your hand , stroking Danny , " Danny 's gold and white head where the darktippedears fell over ; it was a thin hand , olive brown , with long fingers . " Your hand and your eyes , " she could have said . Before she drove off she had looked up and met the stranger 's eyes , brown , oddly thoughtful and gentle in a face that was  --  sardonic ? asked Fanny , but that was not quite right ; it was not bitter or scornful , only aloof . " But it still did not occur to me he was Rob Quillet , " she told Margot . " With the whole village buzzing about the film for weeks ? Did n't you look at his clothes ? " " No , " said Fanny . " What about them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a suit like that and handmade shoes when you see them ? " " For a guess I was wearing a sweat shirt , jeans , and76espadrilles , " said Rob , when she told him this but , " No , " said Fanny to Margot . " I just thought he was nice . " " Nice ! He 's Rob Quillet , probably our best director . They say he will be a de Sica or a Renoir , " but , when Fanny repeated that with pride to Rob , it made him angry . " I 'm a beginner , not halfway there , nor ever will be . Renoir ! He has a humanity none of us will reach and he 's never afraid . " " Are you afraid ? " " Yes . Blast me ! " " Ask anyone , " Margot had said but Fanny did not ask anyone . She kept her usual reticence . " You were n't interested , " Rob teased her . " I was n't then . I had n't really seen you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I went straight back into the shop and asked who you were . " Most lovers , thought Fanny , ask each other , Where ? When ? Why ? I shall never know why , nor could she exactlysay when she had first known the stirrings of this strange , unreasonable , satisfying , never satisfied love . I suppose one day I shall settle down with it , it may even becomehumdrum , thought Fanny , but she knew that it never could . It was too piercing . No , she did not know why , or when , but she could , a little , trace out where ; Margotgave a dinner , thought Fanny . " Odd of Margot to ask you when Darrell is away , " Lady Candida had said . " She needs an extra woman . " " And there are no single women living in this village of single women , I suppose ? " but Fanny knew why Margot had asked her . She could be trusted not to get in the way. 77Margot had got Rob . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catching butterflies and , " I have got Rob Quillet , " she told Fanny on the telephone . " But you were unkind , " Fanny told Rob . " Margot thought you were really interested . She knew enough to know it was n't likely you would dine out when you were in the middle of a picture . " " I came because she said you would be there , " said Rob . " I wanted to look at you again . " " And you did look at me , all through dinner . " Fanny had always been ashamed of how far behind she was with books and plays and fashions , " and facts , " Darrell sometimes said , though kindly . " You dream too much . " At that dinner , Margot had talked of the new Swedish film Skiirgard , The Archipelago . " I have n't seen it , " Fanny had to say . " But Fanny , everybody 's seen it ! " " Who is everybody ? " asked Rob , but Margot did not hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that makes it so topical , " she was saying earnestly . " That superb shot of the girl racked with pain on the edge of that pretty little bed that had been hers as a child . " Fanny knew enough now to burn for Margot ; after all , we were brought up , at least Aunt Isabel brought me up , not to talk to a doctor about illnesses , to a judge about his trials , but Margot had not been worrying Rob , he had simply not been listening ; he seemed curiously abstracted and fidgety , twisting his wine glass , shamefully maltreating Sydney 's splendid ChambolleMusigny . Sydney must have been thinking that film people were vandals , and that Margot 's party was not being the success she had hoped , and Fanny had wondered what78was the matter with this dark stranger . " Dark stranger " sounded like fortune reading in a teacup , but it was as she thought of him . Why was he abstracted ? His hand had left the wine glass and was playing with the roses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suddenly interrupting Sydney , he had leaned forward across the table that Margothad arranged so carefully  --  crystal candlesticks with black shades , black porcelain salt cellars and pepper pots , black plates , the lit roses  --  and he asked , " Is there a rose called Fanny Clavering ? If there is n't , there ought to be . " " That was all over the village by the morning , " Fanny told him . " Sarah Ogilvie was in the room . We could never have a party without Sarah Ogilvie to help us . She went to each of us in turn and it was in turn , " said Fanny , " a kind of tit for tat ; I asked you . It 's your turn to ask me ' ; dinner for dinner , drinks for drinks . " " For heaven 's sake ! " said Rob . It had been all over the village . The voices could not reach Fanny in the villa ; though she had shut her ears and her mind to them for a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; not , to begin with , anyone outside , not even Anthea or Margot  --  because they did not really know , thought Fanny , until I left Stebbings for good  --  but there were important voices , intimate , that had ruled her life ; Darrell , Aunt Isabel , Lady Candida , and suddenly she thought , I shall never have to listen to Lady Candida again . There was one voice Fanny could not shut out , her own . " I know now , " said Fanny , " that people do have a voice of conscience . " It had spoken clearly , steadily , all this time ; she had not been able to stifle it , only refuse to listen as she79had not listened to it that morning after the dinner , when Rob had telephoned . " Rob Quillet here . " His voice had sounded curt , almost clipped . " Will you have dinner with me ? " " I ? " Such complete surprise had showed in Fanny 's voice that , Rob told her afterwards , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ; " I think perhaps you are confusing me with Margot Davenant , " said Fanny gently . " I most certainly am not . Will you come ? " There had been a longer pause before Fanny answered him . Clearly and insistently that voice was saying , " No . Do n't go , " and , " There will be trouble , " but instead of listening she had scolded herself : " You are being ridiculous . Are you turning into one of those middle-aged women who imagine that any man . . . It 's simply that he is bored in Whitcross , " she told herself , though that did not seem likely in the middle of Haysel to Harvest , and the voice still said , " Do n't go . " Fanny went . It had been another Sunday and , as Rob waited for her in the hall  --  she had run up for a handkerchief  --  idly he had looked at three letters ready for the post on the table . " H. D. Clavering , The School House , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Anne 's School , Bentry , Kent . " " Miss Candida Clavering , St. Anne 's School . . . " " My children , " Fanny had explained . " Do you write to them every Sunday as if you were at school too ? " Rob had asked . She had not thought of it that way , as if she too were bound by a set of rules , yet I suppose I was , thought Fanny . Even then , by that first going out with him , she felt as if she were breaking one . Children bound one into a rule , 8 othought Fanny , and , " If you had n't sent us to boarding school , this would n't have happened , " said Caddie . Rob never came to Stebbings again . " It would n't have been fair , " he said . " Though none of it was fair , of course . At least it made me feel a little less guilty when I had you on my own ground . " " But we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Fanny . " Not until you took me to Chirico 's and we made it our own . All those out-of-the-way places where we knew we should n't meet anybody . " Those little inns , restaurantswhere Rob was not known  --  I was n't known in any , thought Fanny . Cheap ones sometimes : there was one in the Fulham Road with red plastic lampshades on the tables , and a little Spanish one where the waiter thought we were married . " It had the quince jelly I liked and you did n't , " she reminded Rob . " Tasting of sour soap , " said Rob . Some of the restaurants were so exalted that they were safe too . Only Rob 's producers might have haunted them ; Fanny might possibly have met Anthea there , certainly no one else she knew . " You must have spent a fortune in those days , " she told Rob . She could not put them into chronological order , tell the dates , the days of the week , but it went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was too big for arithmetic , thought Fanny . Rob was shooting Haysel to Harvest every day of those long dry months , though dogged by the cold winds . " Tryingto work in England ! " he said . " How can anyone get a halcyon hay-making scene in a June north-easter ? " and , " We must finish here by mid-July , " he told Fanny . " We are8ibooked at the studio . " He had , too , rushes to see every day , sometimes at Technicolour  --  Whitcross was handy for West Drayton  --  sometimes at Pinewood ; now and again in WardourStreet . He had evening conferences , script changes , meetings , and all the time , behind Haysel to Harvest  --  a small picture for Rob  --  was looming the big one , Diamond Pipe , that would take him to Africa . " Why Diamond Pipe ? " asked Fanny . " Diamonds come out of pipes , not mines , " and Rob explained . " Over billions of years , the heat at the earth 's core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from deep , deep down to near the surface . No one knows how or why , but some of these vents have solidified into a sort of blue clay , and in that clay , rough stones , diamonds , are found . A pipe might be half a mile in diameter and Diamond Pipe is about one of these huge ones . " Still he found time to meet Fanny , once , twice , three times a week , though she never knew where she must go , by car , by train . Her comings and goings in the Rover were too familiar to be remarked ; Whitcross was used to her driving up to London , or to the airport , to meet Darrell . And it was my business , thought Fanny . Margot had often called Fanny an oyster  --  why is an oyster always derogatory ? wondered Fanny  --  and all that time she said not a word to anyone . She even succeeded in evading Lady Candida , who thought she was giving talks to Women 's Institutes . " She knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fanny did not know . Each time she and Rob met they grew more tense , a tenseness that became unbearable , thought Fanny . If she had come by train he would be waiting for her on the plat-82form , so many platforms , thought Fanny , and they would walk away , not touching one another , we had not touched then , and get in a taxi or Rob 's car . Sometimes I came in the Rover , thought Fanny . Cars tell no tales . " I suppose we were so furtive , " she said to Rob , " becausewe thought it would pass . " " It was never that , " said Rob , " it was just that we decided to be private . " And strangely enough we succeeded , thought Fanny , untilCharmian saw us at the theatre . Charmian , of course , told everyone , but because it was Fanny no one believed there was anything in it . " I did n't believe it myself , " said Fanny . Even in those days , her trust and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . He ca n't mean it , " but it became obvious that Rob did mean it . He was in love . Only in Margot and Anthea a small antenna lifted . Fanny , Anthea reminded Margot , had met Rob Quillet before either of them ; Margot reminded Anthea about the dinner party and they came to see Fanny . It was the day after Charmian and the theatre and Fanny had been making apple jelly . Then it must have been October , thought Fanny , puzzled . She seemed to have skipped over a hiatus of time , but , yes , the children had gone back to school , been back several weeks . Then it must have been the end of October , after Rob and I . . . Then why was I making jelly ? asked Fanny . Force of habit ? Or had it been an excuse not to think ? Now , across the villa terrace drifted the smell of Celestina'scooking , tomato , garlic , peppers , chicken , sizzling in oil . Apple jelly is very English , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batch , or was it sitting , labelled , " Stebbings , October , " on that London larder shelf ? Gwyneth would not have thrown it away , thought Fanny . Fanny had been straining the apple juice when Anthea and Margot had walked in . Gwyneth , sweeping down the front stairs , had told them where to find Fanny . Their faces were portentous . " We want to talk to you . " " Do you mind if I go on ? " Fanny had asked . " It 's something that may be . . . important , " said Anthea . " That is important , " said Margot . " I can listen while I sieve . " " Gwyneth might come in . Anyway she 's in the hall . Ca n't we go up to your room ? " And Fanny had known what was coming . Margot sat in the armchair , Anthea on the dressingtablestool , Fanny on the window sill , facing them ; Anthea had leaned over and pressed her hand . " You wo n't mind what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have said it ? " Fanny smiled at Anthea . " It 's not funny , Fanny , " said Margot . Her eyes were harder than Anthea 's . Well , Margot was piqued , thought Fanny , so piqued that she was angry . It was not that she , Margot , had been prepared to be serious with Rob , but she had undoubtedly been ready to be flattered , marked out , and , yes , perhaps ready for more . It must have been an unpleasant shock to find unintelligent ordinary Fanny preferred to herself , and it was very gently that Fanny had said , " Let me hear what it is . Say it . " 84 " Charmian saw you at the theatre last night with Rob Quillet . " " Yes , he took me , " said Fanny . She found she could keep her voice level . " We saw Charmian . " Fanny seemed to see Whitcross in a new perspective now . " She must have rung you both up this morning ? I knew she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margot again , and , " He seems really attracted to you , " said Anthea . " It was clear at my dinner , " said Margot . " That 's ages ago , " and , " In another life , " Fanny might have added . " He was attracted then . You knew it , Fanny . Everybody knew it . " " How did they ? " asked Fanny . " Unless you told them ? You or Sydney . " Margot coloured at that but she retorted , " Sarah Ogilvie was there , and then he saw you home . " " Was n't that courtesy ? " " Perhaps , but the next night . . . " " The very next night , " said Anthea . " He came here again . " " Yes , " said Fanny . " He took me out to dinner . I thought that kind . " " It may not have been kind , " said Anthea . " I took it that it was . He knew that I was lonely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear , do n't be such an innocent . " " What exactly , " asked Fanny , " are you trying to say to me ? " " This . . . " said Anthea but Margot broke in , " You are a darling , Fanny , but not very worldly wise . " 85 " You are afraid I might lose my head because a man takes me out to dinner and the theatre ? " Are we all such hypocrites when people give us advice ? thought Fanny now . " She deceived us , " Margot and Antheamust be saying now . " I did n't deceive you , " Fanny answeredsilently . " People need only be told as much of the truth as they are entitled to know . You were not entitled to know about Rob and me . " She let them talk and said nothing more . Anthea , sensitive compared to Margot , had been disturbed by Fanny 's silence . " Forgive us , Fanny dear . " " We are old friends , " said Margot . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fanny almost betrayed herself then ; it was this new vanity , she thought , but this was after Rob and I . . . Underher blouse she had been wearing Rob 's ring . It had becomefor her a jewel in the deepest sense , a talisman , the red of the sanctuary lamp that had shone in the frighteninggloom of the church , the deep red of heart 's blood as Rob had said  --  and he had bought it on that afternoon , gone straight out to buy it , never wavering as she was so piteously wavering , even at that moment . " What makes you so sure , " she had asked , " that I should be the one to get hurt ? " She saw Margot and Anthea exchange glances : so Fanny is vain after all . " Shall we , " she had said , getting up , " shall we have some coffee before I get on with my apple jelly ? " " But we did try to stop it , " said Fanny in the villa now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop . " Aunt Isabel had brought me up too thoroughly for me not to know that , " she could have said , " but I had told my-8 6self that it was to be nothing . Nothing but a little light amusement , something to while away the time for him , for me a peccadillo , and I had never had a peccadillo in my life . " To be simply a wife and mother can blot you out , thought Fanny . I had had no fun or flattery for years and I was tempted , but Aunt Isabel and the moral books are right when they tell you , you are playing with fire , tasting goblin fruit . All those cliches are true , thought Fanny . But she had tried . There was a day  --  it must have been far back in June , before these months that she had skipped  --  when she had gone up to London to lunch with Rob , and it was only lunch , thought Fanny , as defiantly as if she could have told that to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Marylebone and as they turned into the station yard , had said , " The same time on Friday ? " " No , Rob . " " No ? " " I 'm not coming again . " Ile had glanced down as he slowed the car . " Do you think that will do any good , my darling ? " " My darling . " Fanny 's heart had begun to beat in a strange suffocating way , and she looked quickly out of the window to hide the tears . " I must try , " she had said . " I nhnst try to stop now . " Rob had said nothing . " I must be frightfully busy , " said Fanny , speaking as slowly and deliberately as if she were dictating . " Too busy to think . I must do all the things I have n't been doing . That have been left , neglected . I do n't know where I have been these last few weeks but I have been neglectful . I must do things . " 87 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he stopped by the curb . " The holidays will soon be here , " Fanny tried not to let the words tremble . " Philippa is going to a family in France . I should have written to the mother again . There are things to do in the house ; the stairs to be painted . I must garden . None of my flowers are in for next year , wallflowers , pansies . " It did not sound important and she gave it up . " All the same , I must try , " and she had said desperately , " Rob , leave me alone . " " Very well . " They were two such quiet little words that Fanny felt rebuffed . " I suppose I was surprised and piqued , " she said now . The tears really came into her eyes and hastily she found the door handle and opened the door before he could get out and come round . " Good-bye , Rob . " " Good-bye . " " You might have made a show of minding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It would have been polite . " " You are not polite when you are in love . " " You did n't seem in the least perturbed or moved . " " I was n't , " said Rob . " I knew we could n't stop , but I knew , too , it was better to let you try . " " I did try . " For more than a month she had lived in a vacuum , blank , somnambulant , " And nobody noticed , except Lady Candida , " said Fanny . " You look listless , Fanny . You need waking up , " and I expect I did , thought Fanny , because I was sleep-walking ; but Lady Candida had not the power to wake her , nor8 8Darrell , nor anyone , not even Hugh . Being without Rob was like being put back to sleep when you had been awake . For the first time in my life , thought Fanny , since I was a child , I was awake . What wisdom there is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beauty "  --  only I am not a beauty , thought Fanny and Rob did not even have to kiss me to shatter me awake ; but the end of " The Sleeping Beauty " was pure fantasy ; in real life even the heroine has to go back to sleep , " And in those endless few weeks , " said Fanny , " I found out what that meant and how far I had gone . " " We had gone , " Rob would have interrupted her . " Yes , but I did n't know that about you then , " Fanny could have answered . " I was sure , for you , this was a passingthing , " and she went steadily on in her sleep-life . Oh yes , I could have stopped then , thought Fanny . Rob and I had barely touched one another , we were still finding out about each other , and ourselves , and I could have gone on with Darrell at Stebbings quite well , only asleep , only knowing with a vague and perpetual unhappiness what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was it in July ? asked Fanny . It must have been because she was sorting the children 's holidayclothes ; towards the end of July , Darrell had come in and said , " The company is leaving . " " What company ? " Fanny was feeling too dimmed to understandeven that . " The film company . The picture is finished , at least the parts they can shoot here , and they are giving a farewell . Anthea 's lending the Big House and Margot is helping to organize it all . " Anthea and Margot seemed to be the fates8gfor us , thought Fanny . " Margot caught me up at the Club House , " said Darrell . " She said she had been ringing here all afternoon . Did n't you hear the telephone ? " " Yes , " said Fanny . " Then . . . ? " " I did n't answer it , " said Fanny and Darrell stared at her . " Are you ill ? " he asked and he still looked at her . " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . Tell me about this . . . this . . . is it a party ? " " It 's a Haysel to Harvest thank you ' for all the locals . The village has been pretty good , helping and providing . The Red Lion will have a free night , and there will be supper  --  and champagne I gather  --  for invited people up at the Big House . All of them in the picture will be there : Gail Starling , Mark Bennet , and this Quillet man , the director . The producer chap 's an Italian and he 's over here . I must say it 's decent of them , " said Darrell . " I thought film people used you and forgot you as soon as they had finished . " " They must forget , " said Fanny . " It 's inevitable , " but the words seemed to stick in her throat . " Ca n't expect them to remember what happened on everypicture , " said Darrell cheerfully . " This is quite impromptu , and Margot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Fanny . " I wo n't , " she might have said . She prayed Darrell would not probe but that was a vain wish with Darrell . " Why not ? Are we doing something ? " he asked at once . " I am. " 9 0 " What have you to do ? " " Something I promised . " Fanny 's voice was near breaking . " You could n't have promised anything very important . " " Important to me . " " You can put it off . " " I ca n't . " " It would do you good , " said Darrell . " You have been in too much lately . That 's why you are looking pale . Mother says you need a good tonic . " " Is a noisy party a tonic ? " " She says you are too quiet . " " I have always been quiet . " " She says . . . " " Darrell ! Will you please ask Lady Candida to leave me alone . " Darrell stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she clenched her hands . " Please , Darrell . " " My dear Fanny ! Very well , if you feel like that , we wo n't go . " " You go . " " If you wo n't , I should rather stay with you . " " No , go ! Go ! Go ! " Fanny wanted to shout at the top of her voice but , " I sha n't be here , " she managed to say calmly . " So I think you should go . You do n't get much fun out of Whitcross . " " I must say I should rather like to see Gail Starling at close quarters , and the grounds will be floodlit when it gets dark , " said Darrell like a small boy . " If you are sure . . . " " Quite sure , " said Fanny . She had to fight the exasperationdown again . " It had come upon me suddenly , " Fanny91told Rob afterwards , " that you were to be so near . " The Big House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stebbings . " I would hear the cars drive up , voices , laughter . Darrell said it was all to be in the garden . . . . " She had thought , when the time came , she would do something onerous . When Darrell had gone , she would turn out the linen cupboard , tidy the attic , anything busy or heavy so that she should not hear or think , but as half past seven came , I could n't do it , thought Fanny . I could n't stay in so near . She had to get away . She went into the cloakroomand blindly took a coat . Gwyneth had come in  --  Fanny had forgotten to tell her Darrell was out for dinner  --  and called , " Are you going out ? " " Taking Danny for a run . " Fanny slipped out through the door at the bottom of the garden , so as not to meet anyone , and up the side lane . It had begun to spot with rain . Poor floodlighting , thought Fanny . Poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the rain was cool as it hit her hot cheeks and aching eyes . There was one walk where people seldom went , a path that led behind the park , up through the woods to the Cross that gave Whitcross its name . It was cut in the chalk of the hill and made a landmark for miles . Only lovers walked this way , to be alone , thought Fanny . She knew that they would be too shut away with themselves to notice anyone else . Her breath felt as if it were choking . Danny ran ahead . The path made a green alley , closed like a maze as it came higher up the hill . I used to tell the children not to run along it in case they might collide with someone comingthe other way , but they always ran , thought Fanny . I9 2was walking fast , my head bent , rain on my face like tears , my hands clenched in my pockets  --  and she had come round the corner full tilt into Rob . I f it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? asked Fanny like a little girl . It was absurd to bring God into it , but , " We were avoiding one another , " she said . Rob could not face the party either . " Not to meet you casually . I knew you were coming . " " Fanny Clavering with her husband , " Margot had said and had looked at him with her emerald gaze , and , " She could look , " said Rob . " Her barb was more right than she dreamed . I knew I could n't see you with another man , going away with him . I thought I would put in an appearance , I had to do that , it was Renato'sparty , and leave when you came . You did n't come  --  but I saw Darrell , " said Rob , " Margot kindly pointed him out to me and I knew I had to go . I went through the park , like a tornado , I expect , and up on the Cross , and looked down on Stebbings , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pebble down your chimneys . I wondered if you were there . I could hear the party and I thought I would go back to town . I started to walk down and you walked into my arms . " " It was literally into your arms , " said Fanny . " Almost before I saw you , you were holding me . You were kissing me . " " It had been so long , " said Rob . " I had almost taught myself not to hope , to make myself think you were right and we had succeeded in being good . I suppose it was good ' officially . After all , I did n't want to break up a home where there were children . I was resigned , or very nearly . I was going to Africa and could try and forget you . Diamond Pipe was an interesting picture , I had always93wanted to do it , then Margot pointed out your husband and I knew I was not resigned , nor ever would be . " " So we were both driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm afraid I wept . " " I thought it was rain on your face , " said Rob . " Until I tasted salt . When I knew they were tears , I knew too I could never let you go . " Fanny opened her eyes . She was not on Whitcross hill with the whitebeams blowing in the rain to show their underleaves , the smell of wet chalk and summer grass . She was in the garden of the villa ; not chilled by the wetness  --  she remembered how Rob had run his hands up her arms under her coat and said , " You 're cold . " She was warm , sunned ; not driven , tormented , but quiet and at peace . The sun , as it grew higher , was even too hot and she opened the Japanese sunshade Rob had brought her back from Milan ; every time he went he came back with presents . " I had n't anyone to buy them for before , " said Rob . The oiled paper cast a cool glow over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lavender glow lit with sun . Now , when she had balanced the sunshade and lay back again and shut her eyes , the light did not swim red through her lids . I did n't feel guilty any more , thought Fanny , not after that day . I hardened . I had tried to stop it , quell it , cut it off , be good , " Officially good " Rob had called it , and it was no good being good . It seemed meant , thought Fanny and , " Why not ? " she had said and told herself that other women had lovers  --  and Rob was not even my lover then . " We had n't consummated it , " said Rob , " if that 's what you mean , but I was your lover . I loved you , and you knew it . " 94 " I knew it , " and Fanny gave the secret satisfied smile of a woman who knows she is loved . All through that time the world had seemed to her lit , bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Caddie and Hugh were to see it that first evening in the villa garden . I have never been nicer to Darrell and the children , thought Fanny , valued Gwyneth more , been more patient with Lady Candida . She remembered Lady Candida 's " You seem very happy , Famny . Thank you . I am . " " Yet only three weeks ago I was telling Darrell you looked as if you needed a good tonic . " " Perhaps I am taking one , " said Fanny . That led to " What tonic ? " " Where did you get it ? Not one of those iron things ? You should take yeast . Brewers ' yeast , " and Fanny , without irritation , promised she would take yeast . That had been perhaps their happiest time , or " Our only absolutely happy time , " they could have said ; afterwardsshe had been too well aware of the ruin , and it was fun , thought Fanny . To her that was surprising . In the puritan mind so carefully instilled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fanny had thought an affair would be  --  in those days she still , conventionally , called this " an affair . " Passionate , yes , breath-taking , but it did not seem suitable for it to be fun . That was an unexpected gift Rob brought her . It was fun to run up to town , be taken out to lunch or dinner  --  in places she had never thought she would see , with food such as she had never tasted ; to be put into taxis , handed in and out of cars , bought flowers , taken to the theatre . No one in Whitcross noticed what she did  --  except95Gwyneth . August was a doldrum time ; most people were away but the Clavering young never wanted to stir from Stebbings , except Philippa and she was in France . Next summer we should have had Marie Jose Lefevre in exchange , thought Fanny ; poor Marie Jose , she would never come now . Hugh had been building a telescope and spent half his time going into High Wycombe or up to London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having riding lessons , beginning to school Topaz . Lady Candida was mercifully absent . She always went to Switzerland for Augustand September , to stay up in the mountains , " Far , far away , " said Fanny . Darrell came and went ; he was in South America for five weeks , she remembered , delayed . He was always being delayed . That , once upon a time had been exasperating ; it had spoiled many invitations ; often at the last minute I had to ring up and say he was not back , thought Fanny , which left me odd woman out , but now it opened the way to a halcyon time , filled only with Rob and herself and if any voice spoke or whispered in her , she stifled it at once . " It 's all harmless , " she told herself even after the warning of the sleep-walking weeks that had gone before . All harmless . What is it ? A few lunches and dinners ; a theatre , an occasional kiss . " We are friends  --  friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a friend ? " and when that was too palpably a lie  --  she had only to meet Rob 's eyes , touch his hand to know it  --  " He is going to Africa , " she would say . " Then it will be over . " Rob was at the studios now , finishing Haysel to Harvest . In the evenings he was up in London , or at Technicolour . They could only meet desultorily , but even when they did not meet . . . " Why did Darrell and the children have so little power ? " 9 6whispered Fanny aloud . " Because Rob had so much . So much , " and in spite of the sun shining down on the villa terrace , she felt as if she shivered . She was getting to the crisis . All that time , Darrell had noticed nothing . " That was n't his fault , " Fanny defended him to Rob . " He did n't notice things , often not until Lady Candida pointed them out to him . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have occurred to Darrell that his wife could fall in love with somebody else . He gave me all his trust , thought Fanny , and I was not trustworthy . Darrell would not have betrayed her , she knew that . Not even if he had fallen as much in love with a woman as she with Rob . If he had not been able to resist it , and she thought he would resist , Darrell would have been able to . . . compartment it , thought Fanny . He would never have hurt her or the children . He was steadfast , thought Fanny , as he was steadfast with his mother , though Fanny had sometimes had an idea that he did not like Lady Candidaany more than she did . Darrell was a disciplinarian  --  well , he is used to commanding a regiment ; he expected people to come up to his standard , particularly his children , but he would never have hurt them , never , thought Fanny , and he was bewildered that she could . " But what did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over again in the one time Fanny saw him . " What did I do wrong ? " " Nothing . Nothing ever . " " Then why ? " Lady Candida too , in Fanny 's last meeting with her  --  I97had to see her for old enmity 's sake  --  " You were n't on bad terms with Darrell ? " " They were n't bad , " Fanny had answered wearily . " Not bad , not good , just terms . " She could not tell Lady Candida that it had all . . . ceased , thought Fanny , if it ever had begun . She knew now that she had never been properly married to Darrell . Some couples , for instance Margot and Sydney , are apart on the surface but can not do without one another . Darrell and Fanny seemed to be of one accord , we were , yes , comfortabletogether , thought Fanny , but I did without him perfectly well . That was not his fault , she insisted again ; he was loyal , faithful , kind ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know enough to question ? " asked Fanny , yet now she saw that her happiest times had been since he was made a Queen 's Messenger and was away so much . " Clavering should n't have left her alone , " they said at the Club House . " Damn it all , if a wife ca n't be faithful while a man does his work . . . " She could imagine them saying that . " But I was faithful , technically , " Fanny might have said . That began to be the trouble . Restlessness set in . The holidaysended . The children went back to school . She remembered how Caddie begged to be a day girl again so that she could go on with Topaz 's training . If it had not been for Rob , should I have persuaded Darrell to let her ? asked Fanny . Lady Candida came back with her prick-needle eyes . " Do you have to be so fidgety , Fanny ? What 's the matter with you ? First down , then up . You ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Darrell must take you away . " " I f you worry Darrell , I shall never speak to you again . " The fierceness was so unlike Fanny , that Lady Candida was more than ever convinced that she was ill . " Something is the matter , " said Lady Candida firmly . Fanny herself did not know what it was , any more than an adolescent knows ; this strange heady excitement , at once miserable and sweet . Lady Candida was right ; Fanny could not be still . She , who had always been peaceful , seemed on jerk-strings , who had been almost selfless , " willynilly , " she might have said , thought only of herself . " I. " " I. " " I , " struggling like a moth to break its chrysalis . She worked in the house and garden , " and hated the house and garden " ; was as impatient as Hugh , silly as Philippa ; could not bear to be with Rob , could not bear to be withouthim ; rushed up to London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but tramped about the streets and came home frustrated . Then driven , thought Fanny , that clay I did telephone . We went to Chirico 's , the rain came and it happened . She sank her cheek into the long-chair cushions remembering that first time . She had said they were innocent , but was she ? Was n't I ripe ? thought Fanny . It seemed to her now she had been like a girl , thin , big-eyed , with lust . Yes , 1 ust , thought Fanny . One should call it by its ugly proper name because it creeps into love ; but it can not maim love , if it is love and , thank God , I was not a girl , thought Fanny , but a woman who can hide what she is thinking . All through that luncheon she could hardly take99her eyes off Rob . Then he had to go to his appointment , and I said I would walk in the park , thought Fanny . Walkingwas the only thing that helped , to walk into exhaustion , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again argued with God . " Why did you let it rain ? " God sends the rain , they always say , not the devil , and there was nothing devilish in what happened that afternoon ; it was more right , more tender , and beautiful than anything I had ever known , known or dreamed of , thought Fanny . Rob had driven her home that night , too tired to think . " You are too tired and so am I , " said Rob . " I will come and see Darrell in the morning , " but Darrell was still away , mercifully , thought Fanny , or I could not have gone back to Stebbings , and even then , thought Fanny now , even then in the month  --  no , it was not a month  --  in the three weeks that followed , I hung fire , shilly-shallied . Rob had argued . " I must talk to Darrell . It 's only honest to leave , Fanny . Leave now . It is n't right that you should stay there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could not bear to stay away from one another , could not have enough . There is a word " slaked , " thought Fanny , when one 's thirst is satisfied ; we were never satisfied , never slaked . Yet Rob was patient . If I had needed any telling , I found out in those weeks how much he loved me , how he could go against himself for me . I did n't know what I was waiting for , or perhaps not waiting , only trying to keep everything together , not hurt Darrell too much , not hurt the children . Perhaps I thought that somehow I could have Rob and the children and Stebbings . Perhaps I could have had them , we could have stayed as we were . No , I was livingi o 0in a fool 's dream , thought Fanny , because Darrell came home , " And he noticed me , " said Fanny . It had dawned slowly . She had heard him talking to Gwyneth . " Is Mrs. Clavering quite well ? " " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gwyneth. " 1 Jpsct ? About what ? " Darrell was honestly perplexed . " It 's been a trying summer and  --  ladies get moods . " " Moods ? " He sounded more than ever lost . " Is there anything you think I could do ? " ( : wyneth 's advice was of the nursery , she had had a great deal to do with children . " I should leave her alone , sir , and she will come out of it . " " Leave her alone . " It might be of the nursery , but it was sound . If Darrell had had the wisdom to do that , should I be here now ? asked Fanny , but Darrell did not leave her alone ; the opposite . He took more notice of me than he had since we were first married , thought Fanny and she wondered , does a woman , roused , give out an emanation , like a female moth ? It was after dinner , the third night he had been home . When Darrell was at Stebbings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Fanny met in the drawing room for a drink before dinner . That always irked the children ; they had an aloof disapproval but Darrell liked to sit , with a whiskey and soda or a gin , telling Fanny about the day , or his last journey . " And I liked it too , " said Fanny . " It was adult . A change from those very children . " Then they had dinner , which Gwyneth used to dish up for Fanny , after which they waited on themselves ; it was a three-course dinner , the table properly laid , " With all the panoply , " saidt o iHugh and the children were not allowed to leave the table for their private ploys , no matter what these were . " Probably good for them , " said Fanny , but again it was irksome . Philippa chafed while some boy who had called for her sounded his horn outside . " You can ask him to come in and have some coffee , " said Darrell . " He does n't want coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been sitting here an hour ! " Hugh had once burst out . " A whole hour , or an hour and three quarters since you started drinking , and there is an important concert I need to hear . " But Darrell had forgotten what it felt like to be young , to be passionate about things , thought Fanny . " Can jazz be so important ? " he had asked , quite kindly , but it was almost with hate that Hugh said , " This is classical jazz . " The girls washed up or , when they were not home , Fanny washed the silver and glass , the rest waited until the morning . She brought coffee into the drawing room . Darrellread the paper or watched television , while Fanny watched too or wrote letters , or mended . At ten o'clock they went tamely to bed , usually to read , thought Fanny , each putting out their own light , with a kiss , usually on the cheek or forehead , only now and then something warmer , again not passionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world , but that October night Darrell did not settle down with the paper , did not switch on a programme , he came over to her and touched her hair . " You 're looking very well tonight , Fanny . " " The same as usual . " Fanny tried to speak lightly . Presentlyshe got up and moved to the other side of the fireplace . " Why go over there ? " i O 2 " It 's too hot . " " You feel beautifully cool , " and he asked , " is n't it time for bed ? " " It 's only a quarter past nine . " " Never mind . Why not go when we want to ? " " You go . I have things to do . " " Not now . " " Yes . I have to . . . " Fanny got up . " Not now , " said Darrell . He got up too . " Damn it all . I have been away for weeks . " He put his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , Fanny , if we went away ? Just you and I , for a few days . Mother says you ought to have a change and I think we deserve it . This job is brutish . You have been alone too long . We could go up to town , do some shows , or what about Madeira ? " asked Darrell . " No , " said Fanny . " No , " but she could not get the words out . He bent his head to kiss her again . She tried not to shrink , but she shrank . He held her firmly , closer . " Darrell , please do n't . " " Why , what 's the matter ? " This , thought Fanny to herself is where you use control . Other women . . . but it was no use thinking of other women . He was holding her closer still and before she could stop herself she had cried out , " Darrell ! Please do n't touch me . " " Do n't touch you ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again to control herself . This was not Darrell 's fault and she did not want him to be hurt , any more than Danny , she thought , and caught herselfback , but there was something as simple and noble as an animal about Darrell . " Not touch you ? I 'm your hus-1 0 3band . " She tried to be still but when that possessive hold tightened , the panic came up again . " I ca n't . " Now the struggling was growing frantic . " I ca n't . Perhaps never again . " " What is all this ? " He was still holding her , but now not in his arms , holding her with his hands as he felt her struggling . " Fanny ! You are not afraid ? " I 'm your husband . Your husband . " " Then help me . " Now Fanny was clinging to him , " Help me . " " Help you ? Why ? How ? " " Just leave me for a little while . Leave me alone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Leave me . Then it may be all right . " " What may be all right ? What 's wrong ? " " Do n't watch me like that . Do n't probe . " " This is all nerves , " said Darrell . " It 's not nerves . Darrell , perhaps I should tell you . . . . " but he was too sure of himself to listen . He was not angry ; he still had not grasped what she was trying , though frantically , to tell him . " This is where , dearest , " he said , " you have to let the man know best . It 's only that somehow in the last few months we have lost one another a little , come somehow to be almost strangers . " So he had noticed , thought Fanny . " It will be all right in a little while , " said Darrell . " No ! No ! " cried Fanny , but he turned her gently towards the door and into the hall . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I knew then that I could n't , " said Fanny . " I had made love with Rob . Yes , that is what I had made , something1 0 4binding , unforgettable , and private ' is not a big enough word , a keep ' between two people , made of minutes that last a lifetime , until death , perhaps past death , and for anyone else to touch me was desecration . " It was hot under the lavender sunshade but again Fanny felt cold . Darrell had steered her to the stairs and stood in the hall , watching her go up . Then she heard him shutting up the house . In the bedroom she stayed still , listening , and as cold as this , thought Fanny , her arms goosefleshed . . . but my head and my temples felt as if they were burning , as if my heart had split and was beating there and in my throat . I heard Darrell come upstairs and go into his dressing room . I heard the sound as he threw his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he went into the bathroom . She had stolen into the dressing room , picked up the keys , and quietly closed and locked the door that led into her bedroom . That would make him pause for a minute or two , poor Darrell . Back in her room Fanny kicked off her thin shoes , pulled on street ones and took a coat and scarf ; her bag and gloves were where she had left them on her dressing table . As Darrell came back from the bathroom into the dressing room , Fanny ran downstairs , along the kitchen passage . Danny got up from his bed to join her but she hushed him peremptorily . She unlocked the back door , slipped through it , taking the key , and locked the door behind her . On the grass she ran to the garage ; it was not locked and silently she opened the doors . Thank God the gate was open , thought Fanny and , thank God , the car was warm . It started at once and she drove out . She thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5thought she heard a shout but it may not have been . She dared not look back . In a moment , she was on the road to London . In January up in Scotland , the petition was served on Fanny by post . She had to sign the " acknowledgment of service , " as her solicitor called it . " Do I need a solicitor as well as you and Darrell ? " she had asked Rob . Mr. McCrae had been Aunt Isabel 's solicitor and , for all his Scots disapproval , when Rob had said that indeed she needed a solicitor , Fanny had instinctively gone to him . Rob 's " acknowledgment of service " had to go to Africa which caused a small delay . She , the guilty one , did not have to appear in court , and it was to Aunt Isabel 's cottage that the telegram came to say that the case was on the warned list . It was heard on April the third and a decree nisi was granted . " In ten minutes flat , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to undo eighteen years . The law had disposed of the problem but it ca n't dispose of people , thought Fanny . Use them as chattels , not even children . I was going to roll it all up , roll it into a ball that I could keep hidden in my hand , or in my heart . It was to be only Rob , Rob and I , together for the rest of our lives . I had accepted that , then . . . and across every plan and thought and feeling came this new triumphant song ; " They ran away . Hugh and Caddie ran away to me . " V " B U T How ? " Fanny had not ceased to say that from the time Hugh and Caddie had arrived . " How did it happen ? How did you get here ? " She asked it again , the next morning on the terrace . " How did you come ? " " Train . Bus . Walked , " said Hugh . Breakfast was over . " If you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept round the clock , the drugged unrefreshing sleep that comes with unhappy exhaustion ; sleep crossed with dreams , nightmare faces from the journey : the portersat Calais , the French girl who had talked all night , a woman solitary on the platform at Dole , they seemed to have been cut into Caddie 's brain . When she woke , she did not at first know where she was , only that she did not like being there . This last year there had been many places where she did not like to wake ; at school where the sight of the white cubicle curtains and narrowiron bed made her feel an exile , the bedroom in the London flat that smelled stuffy and stale and that she had to share with Philippa , which meant that she was squeezed into a corner . At Stebbings she had had the old night nursery to herself and covered it with " a rash of1 0 7animals , " as Hugh said : her collection of porcelain horses ; a string of carthorse brasses , a lucky horseshoe ; photographscut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses : and endless snapshots of Topaz , framed and unframed . Caddie 's room , " Caddie 's tack room , " Hugh called it . Now she woke in what seemed a shadowed cave , filled with the sound of waves , and it was some time before she remembered what she was doing there ; she made out a high pink-washed ceiling , pink walls , bars of sunlight showing through the pull-down shutters . How strange to sleep with shutters down , closed in like a box , thought Caddie . The shape of a wardrobe loomed , a basin with a glimmer of china , a chair over which lay a shape that seemed to be a dress . Hers ? There was a dressing-table with three mirrors and gleam of gilt , and she was lying in a large bed , its posts inlaid with flowers . When she reached up and touched one of them with her finger the flower was gilt . On the bed , pushed away , was a hard bolster , the bottom sheet still tucked immovably round it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were on the floor . From outside came the sound she had thought was waves , a steady splash splash of water ; it was waves , gentle ones ; the lake , thought Caddie . Yes , there was a chugging as if a boat passed . Down below in the house someone was singing again . Caddie 's head had a dull ache . She felt numbed and stupid , and in her mouth was a sour taste . Last night both she and Hugh had drunk the wine Celestina gave them . Presentlyshe slid off the bed and padded over to the basin ; there was no tumbler but she managed to drink from thei o 8tap ; the water only trickled and had a queer strong taste ; it was iron , Fanny told her afterwards . Her eyes were accustomed to the dimness now and she saw that someone had unpacked her grip ; clean clothes were put out . They had brought only vests , socks , and pyjamas but her dress and its knickers had been washed and ironed  --  already ! thought Caddie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " Caddie fashion , " Fanny would have said  --  and brushed her hair ; her school brush and comb looked childish on the big expanse of dressing table . She did not bother to put on her shoes . Then she stood listening . Still only that splashing of water , the singing , and , now , the sound of oars . The bars of light through the shutters fell warm on the floor , warm and deep gold . It must be quite late , thought Caddie and she went to the windows to try and push the shutters up but they were too stiff for her . Then she saw there was a glass door opening from the room . It opened easily and she stepped out onto a small loggia . It was the twin to Fanny 's as Caddie found out later , its windows arched like the Annunciation pictureagain ; its tiled floor was already warm from the sun , grateful to her bare feet after the cold of the bedroom . She leaned her elbows on the loggia sill to look . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shore its blue changed to a clear green and it was here that the waves splashed their freshness against the lower garden wall . In the top garden scents were beginning to warn ; it was full of birds and even from here she could hear the shrilling of Celestina 's caged ones ; swallows flashed past the loggia ; but after a moment , Caddie saw and heard none of these things ; below on the terrace was Rob , Mr.1 o gQuillet , in shorts and singlet , his bare arms and legs lookingdeep brown . Caddie had not really been alive to Rob last night , only been aware that he had sat on the balustrade smoking , that he was dark , as Philippa said , dressed in the dark blue shirt , and white trousers  --  she had taken in the trousers because she had not seen a man wearing them in white linen before . Yet , as if she had absent-mindedly photographedhim , looking down at him now she recognized him with startling distinctness . He was walking up and down and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stuffed , thought Caddie . He was not erect , like Darrellbut he was . . . graceful ? It seemed an odd thing to say of a man . He was not exactly good-looking , his face was too thin and , he has n't very much hair , she thought . It grew far back , giving him a high forehead . Until the last ten days grown people had been to Caddie no more than shades , nothing they said or did was in the least interesting . " Your children are completely selfengrossed , " Lady Candida often told Fanny , to which Philippa , Hugh , and Caddie would have answered that of course they were ; but Philippa and Hugh had at least been conscious of what was going on about them , at any rate as far as it affected them , but Caddie had been wrapped in the snug cocoon she had woven for herself , the private world of Caddie and Topaz . She had been stripped out of it so suddenly that now she seemed to catch the slightest mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking down on Rob , she knew he was more than a little disturbed  --  becauseHugh and I have come ? she asked . " Children should keep out of grown-up affairs , " Gwyn-i i oeth had said  --  but they should n't , thought Caddie now . Already she and Hugh had made an impact and , with the bright morning , she felt filled with confidence and a selfimportanceshe had had only in her Topaz dreams . Withoutgiving herself time to think , she ran downstairs , down those marble stairs , and out onto the terrace . " Hullo , " said Rob . " Good morning , " said Caddie . She had meant it to sound as distant as Hugh 's " How do you do , " but it trailed off into uncertainty . If Rob were disturbed , he was not going to let anybody see it ; his shoulders kept their quiet droop , and his " Hullo " had been quite unperturbed . It brought back the memory of his decisive voice last night when he had put Hugh in his place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thought Caddie , and he had made Fanny go out to dinner  --  when we had just come , thought Caddie , which Darrell certainly could not have done . Caddie had not believed it herself , until she heard the speedboat start . She felt her new confidence ebbing ; perhaps he was even more formidable than he had seemed last night , and what do we call him ? she thought miserably . Mr. Quillet , or Rob ? What did people call Fanny now ? No one knew what to call anyone , thought Caddie . It was part of the uneasinessand she walked past Rob to the balustrade and stood with her elbows on it , feeling the sun on her neck . Opposite the villa , across perhaps a mile of water , a small town lay along the lake ; round it , on the mountain were strange encrustations that , from this distance , looked like pale and elongated honeycombs . " What are those ? " asked Caddie . " That 's Limone , " said Rob . " Limone , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lemon terraces . The lemons have to be grown in screened terraces because of the wind . " She and Hugh had seen lemons being sold all along the road ; inviting-looking bunches , lemons and oranges , on their branches of glossy green leaves , sold from carts , and wooden stands in the towns and villages , some piled in pyramidson the road wall , with a tattered boy to guard them , but she said nothing more . " Are you feeling better ? " asked Rob , Rob Quillet , Mr. Quillet ; Caddie nodded . " Coffee will be here in a minute . We are having it on the terrace this morning . " He stretched and lifted his face to the sun . " Smell the lilacs , " he said . He did not , she noticed , talk to her as if she were a child , but levelly ; the air in this strange garden was touched with fresh and dewy scent but all the same she was not going to give in to anything Italian . " The lilac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . If she had been watching Rob , she would have seen that she had scored a mark . His face had tightened . " I wish I had never seen Stebbings , " he had said once to Fanny . " It never ceases to make me feel guilty . " Fanny had had to try most of all not to think of Stebbingsgarden . That had been all hers , " I made it , " while the house was Lady Candida 's who had ceded it to Darrell and Fanny when they were married , " so it was never mine , " said Fanny ; but she had remade the garden , taking away the orderly laid-out gardener 's plots and making a tangle of old roses , beds so thick with flowers that there was no room for weeds . " It was n't a tidy garden , " Fanny1 1 2said , but filled with richness  --  " and intimate friends , " she could have said . She had spent hours there working . Prenticehad cut the lawns , clipped the hedges and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers were mine , " said Fanny . " The house felt comfortable , " Rob had said . " Easy and content . " " It was , " said Fanny . Stebbings had ample rooms , wide sills on which a child could sit , just as a child could sit comfortablyreading on the stairs . Lady Candida 's Edwardian furniture had given it heavy sofas and chairs , solid tables , brass beds . Its chintzes had been washed so often the patternhad faded to creams , faint pinks , and blues and browns . The bookshelves were filled with an accumulated jumble of leather editions , Penguins , books on cookery and gardening , children 's books . Nobody knew where some of the pictures had come from . " Some of them were frightful , " said Fanny . The silver was good but the china and glass often ran short , it was always being broken , and the linen cupboard was a disgrace ; but there were always log fires , bowls of flowers , plenty of food for children 's guests , plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Thomas , and Topaz , " said Fanny . It was a house that was thoroughly well lived in and Rob had said gloomily , " I can never give you that again . One ca n't buy a house like that . " " You can never buy a home , " Fanny had answered . " You have to make one . We will make one , " she said . The question was where . " Where would you like to live ? " she often asked Rob . " Live when we are . . . when we leave the villa ? " 1 1 3They had often talked of it . " Somewhere beautiful , " Rob would say . " Away but not so far that I ca n't travel backwards and forwards . " " Backwards and forwards to where ? " " Where I am working . " " But that might be anywhere , " Fanny had objected . " Look where you have worked since I have known you . Whitcross . Africa . Rome . Now , if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call it Israel or Jordan ? " " Which means we can live anywhere , " said Rob . " New England is beautiful , or California , though I think Arizona'sbetter . " " But . . . they are in America . " " One can live in America , " Rob had said gravely . " But we could live in Paris , if you want to stay in Europe , or here , in Italy . We have the whole world to choose from , " which was not the same thing , he knew when he was reminded of Stebbings , as having a world of their own and he was curt as he asked Caddie , " Is Hugh getting up ? " " I do n't know . " " Well , tell him to get up and come down . After coffee , your mother and I want to talk to you . " There was no doubt about it , though he did not hector as Darrell did , when this man Rob  --  Mr. Quillet  --  told you to do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woke Hugh . He did not want to get up . " You must . He says so , " said Caddie . Hugh said he had a headache , a pain , and a bad taste in his mouth . Caddie , remembering the taste in114hers , was sympathetic and brought him a glass of water but when he tried to drink it , he retched . " I have a hell of a pain . My inside 's all upset . " " It 's the strain , " said Caddie , quoting Gwyneth . " It is n't . I have eaten something . " ' I'liere was one thing he had eaten that Caddie had not , a piece of pork pie an English woman had given him on the bus . There had been none left for Caddie  --  unfortunately , she had thought then . The only thing that helped Caddie was eating ; she buried her sorrow in food as some people drown theirs in drink . In London she had " stuffed , " said Hugh while he had driven Gwyneth to despair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , " Ca n't Mother come up here ? " he said with a groan . " I do n't think so , " said Caddie , remembering Rob 's voice , and Hugh reluctantly got up . When Rob had said " coffee " instead of " breakfast " Caddie should have been warned , or remembered Switzerland . " Do n't you have cereal , or porridge or eggs , either ? " she asked when she saw the table . " Not in Italy , " said Fanny . " They can if they like , " said Rob . " They have only to ask Cclestina . " " When they are in Italy they should do as the Italians do . " " I do n't see why , when they are English . " Though Caddie would dearly have liked an egg , or better , egg and bacon , but did they have bacon in this barbarous country ? she was not going to take sides with Rob and she ate doggedly through two rolls , though their1 1 5crust was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing at all . " Hugh , have at least a roll . " " Do n't pester him to eat if he does n't want to . " " I 'm not pestering . " There seemed an edginess between Rob and Fanny . It had begun when Hugh at last appeared . " Hugh , you 're up ? " " I sent Caddie to call him . " " Oh , Rob , I wanted him to sleep it out . " " They ca n't do exactly as they like . There are things to arrange , " and breakfast was silent . When Giulietta had taken the tray , Rob lit a cigarette and began : " Now . . . " and , " Yes , we must hear all about it , " said Fanny , coveringHugh 's hand with her own . She meant to make up for Rob 's curtness but Hugh took his hand away . " How did you come ? " " Train . Bus . Walked . " " Yes , but . . . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How did you get away without being missed ? " " Where was  --  Father ? " asked Fanny . " He went the day before Philippa . . . " And even in the midst of his unwellness and antipathy , Hugh could not help smiling at the thought of Darrell 's face when he came home . " He should be back today . " " But Gwyneth was there , and she was always so care-ful . " " She was , " said Hugh and smiled again but Caddie felt a pang . Poor Gwyneth had not had a chance . The thoughti x 6of her left alone in the flat to face Darrell 's questions made Caddie ache . " It was all , all so dreadful , " she said . " You do n't know how dreadful it was . " The last straw had been the sandals , her school sandals . She and Hugh went to buy them the day after Philippa left for Paris , " And the flat was worse , " said Caddie . It was difficult to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had quarrelled incessantly . " It never used to be like this , " said Caddie but then Fanny had been there . She must have been more of a shock absorber and buffer than they had known . In the flat there was continual jarring ; Philippa was highhanded , even with Gwyneth ; Hugh was rude and Caddie , babyishly tearful . Another difficult thing had been that there seemed to be no room . At Stebbings Philippa had had the attic room which Fanny had converted into a bed sitting room , so that Philippa could have her friends up there . " Girls giggling , with the gramophone blaring its head off , " said Hugh . " Girls kicking off their shoes , throwing chocolate papers about , girls always in the bathroom or on the telephone . " They had been all over the flat ; Caddie was ordered out of the sitting room and had to stay in the kitchen . Hugh , disgusted , had to go out . At Stebbings he had had a workbench in the garage , his room was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big enough for setting up his telescope was on the dining-room table . No sooner had he started work than someone wanted to lay the table . " But we must have meals , " said Gwyneth . " Why ca n't we have them in the kitchen ? " " The Colonel in the kitchen ! " 117 " Yes . " Gwyneth said in that case she would have to eat off a tray in her bedroom . " Why ca n't you eat with us ? Too high and mighty , " said Hugh . Gwyneth 's eyes , that were the colour of her own Welsh peat streams , and as clear , looked hurt . " It is n't that , dear . " She had never known how to deal with Hugh . Nor did Darrell . " Darrell to rhyme with barrel , " Hugh used to say , which was palpably nonsense ; Darrell was stocky , but still , " A fine figure of a man , " Gwyneth said . " Especially in uniform , " said Hugh . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He does n't wear uniform now , " said Caddie . " Not for his Messenging . " " He does for all those dinners  --  scarlet and blue and gold , all hung with medals . Bloody handsome , " jeered Hugh . That had been too much for Gwyneth 's Welsh temper . To her Darrell was only one less than Fanny from the stars and , " I 'm ashamed of you , Hugh , " she said . " Your father 's an officer and a true gentleman . I have never known anyone more . . . more upright . " " Oh , Father 's upright , outside and in , " Hugh had to concede that even in his bad temper . Caddie , and Gwyneth , knew too that Hugh was proud of Darrell , and fond of him as they all were . " He 's us , " as Caddie would have said , and , " Yes , upright , outside and in , " Hugh had to say . So could he be when he wanted , but now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Caddie . " It would have been much , much better if Father had let Mother have Hugh , " said Philippa. ii8He was , as Darrell said once when driven to lose his temper , both precocious and abominable . " Sit up ! " Darrell would rap out at last . " Really . Really . You have just told me to sit down . " Yet Darrell had never been more kind , even indulgent . " Trying to be father and mother , " but even Hugh could not mock about that . Darrell stayed away from his club , took them out to lunch to save Gwyneth , gave them tickets for matinees , tried to show them London . " He 's trying to make up , " said Hugh . " He ca n't , " said Caddie . Darrell knew he could not , especially when Hugh chose to stay in and work on his telescope . Then Caddie 's heart ached for her father , as it had for Hugh and Philippa . She tried to do things for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given her and Philippa the largest room . Every night she turned down his bed and laid out his pyjamas . He had come upon her looking at a hole in one of his socks . " Give it to Flip , to mend , " he said , but Philippa , Caddie knew , was too busy getting ready for Paris . " I will give it to Gwyneth . " " No , do n't . She has too much to do now . " " I can try and darn it , but I 'm not very good . " " No , never mind . You have your own things . Tell you what , " said Darrell . " I will buy some new pairs , " and he had stuffed the socks into his pocket . " You ca n't go out with socks in your pocket . " " It 's only so that Gwyneth should n't see . I can drop them in a litter basket , " and Caddie had suddenly flung herself at her father and hugged him . I 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family . Day after day was bleak , angry , miserable , and empty . " She 's missing her mother , " Gwyneth said but it was not Fanny that Caddie missed . " Father , may I speak to you ? What . . . what is going to happen to Topaz ? " " Well , we ca n't keep him in London , can we ? " The false heartiness in Darrell 's voice made Caddie 's heart sink like a stone . " Do we have to live in London ? " " It 's the easiest , Caddie , for the most people . I have to come and go . Soon Philippa will start training . Besides we could n't manage Stebbings without . . . Mother . " " Could n't you . " Caddie sensed where she was treading but she had to say it . " Could n't you make her come back ? " " Because of Topaz ? " Darrell tried to make his voice light but did not succeed . " Topaz  --  and other things . Everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wish I could , Diddie , but . " He used her baby name and it was the first time Caddie had ever seen big , powerful Darrell helpless . He looked as if he , too , might cry . Father cry ? thought Caddie , stunned . Indeed he could not look at her , he seemed to have a mist in his eyes , and he drew clumsy men with sticks for arms and legs on his blotting paper . " You have done very well with that pony , " he said . " Do you know that Will Ringells says he will give you twenty-five pounds for him ? " " I do n't want twenty-five pounds , " said Caddie. 1 2 0 " Then one day , when perhaps I can arrange for you to be in the country again , you could buy an even better pony . " " I do n't want a better pony . " " I see , " said Darrell . " Well , we 'll leave him where he is with Ringells for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It 's three guineas a week , " whispered Caddie . " We can run to that for a little while , then we can see . " Darrell 's voice had been very kind but it was a knell to Caddie . " They will do it , sell Topaz , when I 'm away at school . " School was getting near , only a few days , when Darrell had had to make one of his sudden absences . " An undivulgederrand to an unknown destination , " mocked Hugh . " You ought to be proud to have a father who is a Queen 's Messenger , " said Gwyneth . They were proud , even Caddie often boasted about it , but the excitement had become familiar ; it really only meant that Darrell was away , more often than not . " Conveniently , as it turned out , " said Hugh . There had been trouble over Philippa 's going because she had wanted to travel in trousers . " Trousers ! " Lady Candida had been horrified . " Girls all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls do n't , and you most certainly will not . " In the end Philippa had to give way because Lady Candida threatened to withdraw the twenty pounds she was giving her as a parting present . All the same Lady Candida would not come up to see her off  --  " She thinks that 's a punishment , " said Philippa  --  and there were only1 2 11-Iugh and Caddie at the Paris train , " In a horde of girls , " said Hugh . " Not a horde , there were only eight , " said Caddie . " I never heard such a din in my life . " Hugh and Caddie had stood side by side at the carriage door , but Philippa had taken little notice of them , " Except to guy us , " said Hugh . " This is my little brother , Hugh . This infant with the freckles is Caddie . " " That 's what we get for coming . Let 's go , " Hugh had said but Caddie insisted on staying . " Flip 's showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Caddie , " and she must have someone to wave to . All the others have fathers or mothers , fathers and mothers , " said Caddie . They had come back to a flat that seemed darker and more desolate than ever and found Gwyneth worrying about their school clothes . " The Colonel asked me to do them but I just do n't know , " said Gwyneth helplessly . " I do n't know . Your mother has always done this . " At Stebbings , three times a year , the house had rung with : " Has anyone seen my Larousse ? " " Oh , Moth-er ! Not name tapes even on handkerchiefs . " " Those tennis balls are mine . " " Caddie , only two pounds of sweets . " Packing for the summer term was particularly elaborate : thick things , thin things : cricket flannels and boots , white sweaters , white socks . Tennis shorts . Balls in nets , bathing dresses . " Do you have to have all these things ? " asked Gwyneth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , " said Caddie . " If I could have gone for one week , " Fanny had said to1 2 2Rob , to the solicitors , finally to Darrell . " Just to get them ready . " But in his one interview with her , Darrell had treated her as a stranger . " Which is nonsense , " Fanny had cried . " Guilty , yes , but I ca n't be a stranger . " It was Darrell who was the stranger ; Fanny had not known he could look as old and drawn . Rob had said , " Do n't see him . It 's kinder . " " I ca n't be kind . I must fight for the children . " " It 's no good , Fanny . " " If he would let us have them , even half the time . " " He wo n't , " said Rob . " He must , " but Darrell was adamant . " You chose , " was all he said . " I did n't . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anything that she , this importunate stranger , might say . " My children , " said Darrell deliberately . " Philippa , Hugh , Caddie . " Being Darrell he had to be fair , **25;4717;TOOLONG the judge 's orders . " They can visit you sometimes . Short visits . " She had had a letter from Darrell , written in the midst of the proceedings , a letter she would never forget and could not answer . " If I had answered , I should have gone back , " because there was not a reproach in it , only a desperateplea . " It 's not only myself I am thinking of , it 's of the children . No , I am thinking of myself , " wrote Darrell . " You are my wife . This other man . . . " To Darrell , Rob would always be " the other man , " the intruder . " You ca n't jeopardize a whole world . " " It is n't jeopardized , " Fanny wanted to cry . " It 's gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Ca n't you ? " wrote Darrell . " I will try not to touch123you . If I had understood . . . " and the letter ended : " Please . Please . Please . " Fanny did not know what had given her the hardnessto tear it up and the hardness to carry on this fight . " Philippa 's over sixteen . You ca n't stop her , " she hadsaid . " I think Philippa will decide to stay with me . " Will she ? With Rob in films ? Fanny wondered . She knew her Philippa , and she was sure that presently Darrell would be stabbed by Philippa too . Hugh ? " Nothing  --  nothing you can do , can separate Hugh from me , " she had flung at him . That was foolish . It gave him his opportunity . " Nothing I can do , " he had said . " You forget something . They may not want to visit you . " Fanny could only try and comfort herself . " If I had died , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gwyneth is there . " Unknown to Darrell , Gwyneth had come to the airport to see Fanny off to Milan . At the last minute , Fanny had put her arms round the familiar figure , though looking unfamiliar in a London coat , grey gloves , black handbag , and black straw hat with black hatpins , her face unrelentinglystiff . " Thank God they have you , " Fanny had said as she kissed her and desperately , " Gwyneth , make Hugh take his warm pyjamas , it 's still cold at the beginning of term . Tins of sausages and ham in his tuck box , not all sweet things . Send him a cake now and then . " Tears had run down Gwyneth 's face . " I will do my best . " " Caddie 's old enough to help sew on name tapes now . Hugh ... " I24 " I will do my best . " " Write to me . " " I 'm not much hand at writing , " but Gwyneth wrote . Now , " Three regulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list . " Regulation blazer . . . " " Why does everything have to be regulation ? " Philippa had always flared . " Because girls have ideas , " said Hugh . " I have found the dresses , " Gwyneth went on , " but they will need letting down . Oh dear ! There is n't much time . " " I can wear them short , " said Caddie miserably . " And be all legs . " " Hush , Hugh . Two cotton dresses . . . " Gwyneth 's finger came down the list as she faithfully read out every word . " Own pattern for wearing in the evening . Have you those , Caddie ? " " Grown out of them , " Caddie muttered . She seemed in a state of growing out of everything . " We must get them then , " said Gwyneth . " You had better shop tomorrow . " " By myself ? " asked Caddie in terrible alarm . " We can ask Lady Candida if she could come up . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Mother to everyone . You come , " she begged Gwyneth . " I would n't be any use , not in shops like that . Philippa ought to have helped you before she went . " " Too busy with her own clothes , " said Hugh . " One thing , about Flip , she wo n't try and be a little mother to us . No fear , " and with one of his sudden turns of sweet-125ness he had said , " Do n't worry , Diddie . I will choose your clothes . " He had , and , " They were the prettiest dresses I ever had in my life , " said Caddie , " and he helped me to buy a dressing gown and a bathing dress . He was nice to everyoneand everyone was nice to us . " It had almost been happy until it came to the shoes . " Regulation summer sandals , " said the list , and , " Good Lord ! " said Hugh when they appeared . " Your feet ca n't be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the assistant in the first shop had said . " Try Daniel Neal 's . They go up to sevens there . " " I 'm not a seven , I 'm only a five , " Caddie had wanted to say but even in fives the sandals looked like boats . " Boats ? Barges ! Flats ! " said Hugh . It was not only their flatness , it was their childish shape . " Girls my age should n't be made to wear shoes like that , " she had wanted to cry passionately . If Fanny had been there she would have found a way out , a compromise between Caddieand the school , but Fanny was not there and Hugh was tiring . He certainly would not be dragged to any more shops and anyway , she , Caddie , was due at the dentist'sfor a pre-school check up . " I will drop you , " said Hugh . " You can come home by yourself , ca n't you ? I want to get on with my telescope , " and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bag . I shall have to wear them , thought Caddie . With them and the too-short uniformdresses she would be what Hugh said she was , all feet and legs , knees , elbows , and freckles . Fanny would have shed a ray of hope : " It 's only a phase . Your feet will126shrink . Philippa 's did , " and the dresses would have been let down . Fanny would have gone with Caddie to the dentistand after it they would probably have had hot chocolateor an ice , but Fanny was in Italy and suddenly , there in Daniel Neal 's , Caddie had rebelled . It was such a violent storm of rebellion that it visibly shook her . It was hatred of her sandals , of the dentist , of going back alone to the flat , of Fanny 's absence , of Mr. Quillet , Darrell , and all grown-ups ; such hatred and despair , confusion and misery that she cast her parcels on a chair and , " Let 's not have it , " said Caddie in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Refuse ? " " Absolutely refuse . " " My good child , what are you talking about ? " Hugh had looked calm and slim , leaning back in the shop chair waiting for his change , in his grey flannel suit , his hair brushed , his shoes shining . Beside him , Caddie felt shabby and tousled . It was strange that while this impact with adult life had made Philippa romance and tell lies , it had thrown Caddie into truth , and the truth was very dreary , particularly about herself . " It 's just that you are at the awkward age , " Gwyneth tried to tell her but Caddiewas convinced she was hideous . " Hideous ! " she had said in despair . Now she was so angry that she did not care . " Let 's refuse to allow Mother to go away like this . Just not have it . Refuse . " " How ? " But Hugh had sat up in his chair . " Refuse to go to school . " said Caddie . " To go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live with Fatheralone . " " You can say refuse , but . . . " began Hugh . " Not say it . Do it , " said Caddie . " But how do we do it ? " " We wo n't go back to school , " said Caddie breathlessly . " We will leave . Run away , " and then she had had her inspiration . " Let 's go to this place in Italy and fetch her . " VI " B UT How did you find out where it was ? " asked Fanny . " How did you know how to get here ? " " Asked , " said Hugh but it had not been as simple as all that . They knew the address . Darrell had given it to them ; in fact it was then that Lady Candida had really " Clinched it , " said Hugh . " You must write to your mother , " Darrell had said and printed for them : " Villa Fiorita , Malcesine-sul-Garda , Prov . Verona , Italy . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you , sir , " Hugh had said . " I 'm not going to write . " Darrell had looked astonished , even grateful , as if Hugh had given him a tribute , but he was always fair . " Do n't think too hardly of your mother . It was my fault too . She was lonely . " " I do think hardly of her , " said Hugh . " And one can understand it , " Lady Candida had put in . She tried to smooth Hugh 's hair but he jerked away at once . " It 's always the children who suffer most , " said Lady Candida . " They are the victims . " 1 2 9 " I wo n't be a victim , " Hugh had said when he was alone with Caddie . " A victim " as if it stuck in his teeth . " Then , do n't , " said Caddie . " Do n't let 's be . Let 's go . " She had had some vague and Dick Whittingtonish idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure boat , then walking again through France , though she was vague about this , cadging lifts , with their food done up in a handkerchief , Hugh carrying a bundle . She blushed now to think how childish that had been ; Hugh , once he had accepted her idea , became a master planner . " The plan was to leave the day we went to school , " he told Fanny and Rob , now , on the terrace . " Luckily it was the same date for both of us . " Piece by piece he had thought it out . " It did n't all happen in five minutes , as I say it , " he told them . Telling about it , Hugh had almost forgotten his sullenness , his headache and pain . " I tell you , it took time . " " But not the telegrams , " put in Caddie . " You thought of them in a minute . " " I think we should send telegrams , " he had told her . " Writing is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father or Gran , or even look like them , even if we had it typed . " Perhaps Hugh 's strength lay in knowing his limitations . He was seldom naive . " Yes . We will send telegrams . " " Saying what ? " Caddie had asked and Hugh had reeled it off : " Regret Candida unable return today suspected measles writing signed Clavering , ' the same for me , to Strode , " said Hugh . " Suspected ' was clever , " said Rob . " It kept them hangingabout. " 1 3 0 " Yes , I thought they would wait for news . . . . " Hugh caught himself back . He had almost called Rob " sir . " Gwyneth had played into their hands by asking Hugh to put Caddie on the train , " As you will be going off yourself , dear . She wo n't want me to see her off , " said Gwyneth . " Not in front of the other girls . " Caddie 's school train went from Victoria . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " One of the St. Anne 's girls might have seen Caddie and recognized her , even though our train left from another part . For Continental trains , one uses a different entrance , " he explained to Rob . It had , too , been tight for time . " Caddie 's school train left at a quarter past two , ours at half past . I had to run . " " Does she count you ? " he had asked Caddie . " Who ? " " The woman who takes you down to Bendry . There is a mistress with you ? " " Usually Miss Prescott . She has a list and ticks us off . " " Ilcli ! " And Hugh exploded , " Girls ' schools ! At Strode we can arrive any time , anyhow , as long as we are there for call-over in the evening . She may not have heard about the telegram and if you are not there at the station , someone might telephone . " " Could you take a note ? " Caddie had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter . " No . We will get to Victoria an hour early , " Hugh had decided . He would deposit Caddiein the refreshment room on the Continental side . In the taxi , she was to put on a head scarf to hide her hair , " It 's so ginger anyone would recognize it "  --  and hide her hat . She had to leave in her panama because of Gwyneth , 1 3 1 " And anyone could see that ghastly emerald band right across the station . " " Dark glasses , " Hugh had said , enjoyinghimself , " and you can hold up a newspaper . " He would leave her at a table  --  " You can have a drink and buy one or two sandwiches for us to eat on the train "  --  and he , himself , would arrive breathless on the schooltrainplatform . " I can say Father sent me . Too late to telephone , and we 're a bit disorganized . They are sure to know all the dirt , " said Hugh bitterly and he rehearsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my sister , is in bed . The doctor thinks it 's measles . She wo n't be travelling . " " I shall just have time to shoot back , and pick you up and get us on the train . And that 's how it was , " he told Rob and Fanny ; but Hugh did not know how it was , sitting in that refreshment room on the Continental side for half an hour . " Half an hour ! Half eternity ! " Caddie might have said . As Hugh had told her to , she held a newspaper up behind her glass of chemically brilliant orange squash , but she could neither drink nor read . She had more than a suspicion too that Hugh had overdone it ; in the head scarf and dark glasses , crouched down in the chair and peering cautiously round the newspaper , she looked far more noticeablethan a girl in a panama and school blazer , especially as the station was full of them , thought Caddie . Still , no one had looked at her or spoken ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hugh get back in time ? What would she do if he did n't ? The hands of the refreshment-room clock crept round to a quarter past two . The school train would be moving off , the girls crowding the windows to wave as they were1 3 ztaken away to their safe enclosed world , as Caddie had been for three terms past , when the only ache had been leaving Stebbings and Topaz . Now the girls , Caddie herself in those days , seemed to her like children one sees in far-off , sunny pictures , unreal . This refreshment room was real , horribly real . Where was Hugh ? Had Miss Prescott believed him , or had she snatched him off to telephone  --  hut there would not have been time . Had she turned him over to the police ? Caddie felt sick with fear ; Miss Prescott , Gwyneth , a gentle couple , had turned into hunters , enemies ; and Caddie was sick at heart ; the numbness of her loss was wearing off , as it wears off from an amputation when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amputation that left her no reason for living that she could see . " If we do get Mother back , what use will it be to me now ? " A terrible stifling lump was beginning to come in Caddie 's throat . She had to take off the dark glasses because they were blurred with wetness , and her eyes flinched from the hard white light . We shall miss the train , thought Caddie . I do n't care if we do . I shall never care about anything ever again . The lump was breaking into hurtful tearless sobs when Hugh 's impatient voice sounded across the table . " Hurry up , slow coach . I have bagged two seats . " " But how did you know where Malcesine was ? " asked Fanny . " It was obvious , " said Hugh . " We just worked backwardsfrom the address . Italy ; Verona , ' That 's a town , " he had showed it to Caddie on the map . " Its province must be round it . Malcesine-sul-Garda ; sul ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garda is that lake , see , near Verona , but Malcesine does n't seem to be big , probably almost a vil-133lage , and the railway does n't seem to go there . We shall have to ask if we go to Verona or where . " Here Caddie had been of some help . " Remember when we used to go to Hamley 's toy shop ? " she asked . " Hamley 's ? " " When you collected trains . " Like a red Indian or an elephant , she remembered every least thing Hugh had ever done and that always made him bad-tempered . " My good child , what has that to do with Italy ? " " Only that , opposite Hamley 's , there was an Italian travellingplace . " " So there was , " said Hugh . " How did you remember that ? " Caddie had remembered it because in its windows were model painted carts drawn by little wooden horses with feathers on their heads . Every time they went to Hamley'sshe used to cross over and look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " We could ask there . " " You will be travelling alone ? " They had stiffened . This is where we run into trouble , thought Hugh and Caddie'sheart beat uncomfortably , but it seemed a routine question and when Hugh said , " Yes , " in as chilly and grown-up a way as possible , the clerk had only gone on looking up the time table . There was no need , as Hugh had told her afterwards , for Caddie to say , " We are going to our mother . " " I see , " said the clerk . " For Malcesine you must go by train to Desenzano . " " Desin . . . " That was a name that even Hugh had never heard of . " Would you write it down ? " he said . " Desenzano , " the clerk wrote down and added , " It 's one134of the only two railway stations on the lake . You can take the bus or ferry on from there . " Hugh had nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew already but Caddie asked , " How do we get to Desenz . . . Desen . . . " " Desenzano ? You can go by air to Milan , the tourist fare is twenty-three pounds thirteen shillings single . Or by air to Paris , nine pounds eleven shillings , and catch the night express , ten-forty-four from the Gare de Lyon . " " Is n't there a through ? " Hugh had asked to Caddie 's admiration . " Ah , yes , but that is slow . You leave Victoria at half past two in the afternoon , change at Paris . Leave there at midnight , arrive in Milan at one-thirty next day and on by the same train to Desenzano . You get there at three o'clock . The single fare is ten pounds , four shillings . As Miss , I think , is not fourteen , she would be half . " " That will suit us , " said Hugh , and the clerk asked , " You have passports ? " " Naturally , " said Hugh . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As soon as Hugh had said that he knew it was the wrong answer , and Caddie once again had to blurt out , " Of course they are valid . They are new . " " I hey had all three been given passports when they went to Switzerland for that Christmas holiday . Most children under sixteen travelled on their mother 's , but for the reasonthat had not been divulged to them then , they were not on Fanny 's . They had had their passport photographs taken ; even one of those could not make Hugh look plain , though he was squinting , but Caddie 's face looked lumpy135and glowering . " Well , I did n't want to go to Switzerland . I wanted to stay at Stebbings and get on . " She did not have to say " get on with what . " Her hair was parted in a way that gave her an enormous forehead and she had hunched one shoulder up ; " And that passport does n't expire for anotherten years ! " said Caddie . " But did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fanny . " I thought children were not allowed to leave the coun-try . " " They go backwards and forwards so much , to schools , service families , U.N. , " said Rob , " that long ago they ceased to be remarkable . Children think nothing of it now . " " Some children , " Caddie would have corrected him but this time Hugh could not help looking at him appreciatively . Here was one person who did not treat grown-up children " as morons , " said Hugh . The passports were kept in a pigeonhole in Darrell 's desk . Here , too , were what Hugh had his eye on : envelopes in which Darrell kept the bits and pieces of foreign currencyleft over from his travels , not large sums but odd coins and small notes . " If we watched we could always know where Father was going by what money he takes , " said Hugh . When Darrell was away , he gave the key of the desk to Gwyneth , because it was here too that she kept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , money for the children 's school clothes , travelling money . Gwyneth was so afraid of losing the key , or having it stolen in this London she did not trust , that she wore the key on a cord round her neck day and night . How to get it with-1 3 6out her knowing ? The answer , with anyone as careful and staunch as Gwyneth , was nohow . " Though she would never suspect us , " said Hugh . That seemed to make it more their duty to protect Gwyneth and , " We must do it when the desk is open , " said Hugh . " After all , it 's only our passports and some currencywe want . " Dear Gwyneth ! It was a shame to trick her , " But we had to , " said Hugh . It turned out to be only too easy , which made Caddie ache for Gwyneth again . Easy and a little diabolical . " I must pay the butcher , " Gwyneth had said and went to the desk , Hugh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a small thickness of notes . " I cashed ten pounds , " she said and carefully counted out three pound notes and put down the rest on the table . " Three pounds , four shillings , " she said peering at the book . " It 's much too dear , but there it is . That 's London , " and she took up her purse to find the silver . Hugh , standingbehind Caddie , put his hand round , peeled off three more pound notes and slid them under the blotter . The next moment Caddie began to count what was left . " Did you say ten pounds ? " she asked , not very steadily  --  " You are lousy as an actor , " Hugh told her later  --  " You took three , " called Caddie , " that should leave seven . There are only four here . " " Four ! " Gwyneth 's face turned mottled , then red . She snatched the notes from Caddie . " Four ! But I 'm certain . Look ! Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Hugh , looking . " They must have fallen on the floor . " As Gwyneth bent to look , Caddie saw137him take the first envelope  --  each was labelled in Darrell 's neat writing , " French Francs , " " Pesetas , " ' Marks , " " Kronen " and so on . Caddie lifted up the blotter for Gwyneth to search the desk top and lifted the three notes with it . " Must be in my purse . " Gwyneth was almost incoherent . She rushed to the kitchen , leaving the desk open . It was only a moment before Caddie again sang out , " Gwyneth , they are here . I have found them . Look . Under the blotter . " Gwyneth came running back , her agitated steps shakingthe flat , as Hugh , his pockets heavy , two flat shapes under his jacket , walked out of the study , whistling , but there had been no Italian small money , only the tenthousand-lirenote . Darrell must have put it there by mistake . " Ten thousand lire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six pounds . " " Then why could n't they say so ? " These thousands and hundreds that whirled round them in Italy  --  two hundred lire for an apple , a hundred and fifty for a roll with ham  --  seemed part of this twopence-coloured exaggeration that Caddie distrusted , " As much as Darrell would have done , " Fanny said afterwards . Ten thousand lire , but , " It was n't stealing , " Caddie said now to Rob and Fanny . " We put our school money in to make it even . Hugh had four pounds , and I had two , which made it nearly right . " They would need , Hugh said , French and Swiss francs , Italian lire . " We had a few of our own Swiss from Christ-mas . " " How much did you have altogether ? " asked Rob now . " Nineteen new French francs . " " And sixteen centimes , " said Caddie. . . in bits and pieces . Twelve Swiss francs . " 138 " And seventy Swiss centimes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caddie was silent about the English money . " Do we go through all those countries ? " she had asked with dismay . Caddie , as Hugh said , had no sense of adventure . To her the many different countries only magnified her dread of going , and moments of that journey stayed with her forever . At Folkestone , for instance , when the long crocodile of passengers went down the covered way to the quay , it was a quarter-of-a-mile walk to the boat , they had had to pass the barrier of a man checking passports . In his tweed overcoat and string gloves , he looked to Caddie 's imagination like a detective and she flinched . Hugh gave her a sharp blow in the back . " Go on , donkey , " and , " If you look like that someone will think something is wrong and stop us . " On board the boat Hugh took Caddie to the cafeteria and gave her a cup of tea . He had a cup-cake and she had a fruit pie . It was disappointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside it were hard cherries and chips of apple . The cafeteria smelled of rubber , steam , and wet people . Its decks seemed to swell and lift . " It 's the sea , " said Caddie . " Yes . We have left . " " I wish I had n't had that horrid fruit pie , " said Caddie suddenly , and suddenly too , " Oh , I wish , wish Mother was here . " When they docked at Calais  --  which did not look very different from England  --  the loudspeaker blared : " Passengersfor train thirty-two . " " That 's us , " said Hugh appearingbeside her . He had their tickets , two pieces of pink pa-139per in a folder . " Train thirty-two , and all passengers for Paris , turn right at the bottom of the gangway , " said the loudspeaker . " For these passengers , passport 's and customs will be on the train . " " Which is where they may find us , " said Hugh . He only said it to frighten Caddie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then there were the porters , terrifyingly big men in blue blouses and black caps , pushing through the crowd , shouting in French . On the quayside French notices hung all along the big shed : " Douane , " " Passeports ici , " " Calais depart 7.40 " ; but in the train the notices were in four languages : " Do not lean out of the window . " " Ne pas se pencher en dehors . " " Pericoloso sporgersi . " " Nicht hinauslehnen . " " We shall have to say Pericoloso sporgersi , ' " Caddie whispered to Hugh , " and Vietato f urnare . ' " That was exciting , but as the evening came the journey had taken on a strange loneliness . Outside the carriage windows the light grew blue . The little lonely French farms made Caddie think of Topaz , so that for a moment she forgot she was looking at France and not at England but crepuscule , which Hugh told her was the French for twilight , seemed to suit the dusk that was creeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the villages seem far apart ; now and again there was a soli- tary spire , a chateau . Even in the carriage it was crepuscule , then a man in the corner took out his travelling radio and a raucous French voice shattered the quiet. i 4 0There was a scene in the dining car which even now made her hot to remember . A man had come down the corridor ringing a little bell . Caddie had known at once what it was , " By instinct , " said Hugh , " dinner , " and they had followed the other passengers down the long train , past couchettes where whole families had seemed to be encamped , and luxurious wagons-lits , but when Hugh saw the dining car he had stopped short , looking at the white ornamented ceiling , red carpet , red plush chairs , the white tablecloths , white-coated waiters and , " It 's terribly expensive , " he had whispered . Caddie was too hungry to care . " Ask how much it is . " " I ca n't . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head waiter had already come and motioned them to a table , whisked their napkins to their laps , handed them the menu , and vanished to the next people . " Presente par le chef de Brigade Atlas , " they read in gold letters . The rest was equally impressive : " Potage cres-soniere . " " Supreme de colinelino Eloise . . . " but they got no further . " Prix fixe , " read Hugh . " 18 N.F. " " What does that mean ? " " It means we do n't have any dinner . " " But . . . oh Hugh ! " " Eighteen new francs , eighteen hundred old . More than thirty shillings each . " " Thirty shillings for dinner ? " " Yes . Come on . I have n't got it . " " But . . . " " I have n't got it . We have n't that much French money . " i 4 i " Could n't you ask if we could just have one thing ? Even soup . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was desperate . " Could n't you say we are chil-dren ? " The look Hugh gave her was annihilating . He got up , threw down his napkin , and rushed past the head waiter from the car . Scarlet in the face , staggering against tables as the train rocked , Caddie followed him . They ate the refreshment-room sandwiches from the net bag . On the ship Caddie had laid it on the rail and the bread was sodden . Of the night Caddie remembered chiefly the long way through Paris from one station to the other ; there had been glimpses of streets , some wide with trees , once one with pave brightly lit ; high houses with lighted windows , empty stations . It was like a train journey in a film . In an eternity of slow bumping motion and whining sounds , they sat silent in their corners , lights and shadows brushing their faces . Caddie fell half asleep and woke to grinding stop . Everyone in the carriage was standing up . It was the Gare de Lyon and the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which train ? " she had asked in a panic . " It 's that one , " said Hugh , nodding opposite . " Are you sure ? " " People are going into it , but we can walk up to the front and see its number . " " Its number ? What 's its number ? " " Five-nineteen . " " How do you know ? " 142 " It 's on our tickets . " Hugh was being patient . " Come on . Then we can walk down and find the right coach . " Once again , Hugh 's resource had filled Caddie with awe . He looked almost a little boy , red-eyed , his hair on end , dirt on his cheek , his shirt collar crumpled , but he knew what to do and the train opposite was five-nineteen . It was in the early hours that regrets had begun . We should n't have come , thought Hugh . It was stupid . TypicalCaddie ! He looked at his sister on the seat opposite and almost hated her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been better even to be in the flat . " It was silly , silly , " the wheels seemed to hammer in her head . " Silly . We shall never get there . " Once she woke startled . " Hugh ! Hugh ! " " Go to sleep , " growled Hugh , but Caddie only slept in snatches . A French girl in their carriage had stayed out in the corridor all night talking , a girl in trousers . So Philippa was right ; they do travel in trousers . A woman at Dole was sitting on a bench , a pile of luggage beside her . What was she doing there at three in the morning ? They woke to a dawn of eerie daylight and snow , with the train standing still . They were at Vallorbe , which Hugh said was the frontier . " Frontier of Italy ? " Caddie had asked hopefully . " No , you clot . Switzerland . " " But we did have breakfast in Switzerland , " Caddie told Rob and Fanny . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dining car had not looked as expensive ; it had wooden and leather chairs , the tables laid with blue plates , each with a cup and saucer on it , the cups as big as143Darrell 's bumper . A man came round with a basket of rolls calling : " Deux pour chaque personne . Deux . " " Only two , " Hugh cautioned Caddie . Coffee and milk were poured into each cup and for each person , too , there was a miniature saucer of jam , two curls of butter . It was not much but it was good , and the whole world seemed curiously lighted . " They wo n't turn us back now . We have gone too far , " said Hugh . They sat side by side , breaking the crisp rolls  --  people were dipping theirs into the coffee , Caddie saw with astonishment  --  and drinking the good coffee and they felt almost happy , but the breakfast was inordinately expensive , three francs fifty for a cup of coffeeand two little rolls . " And jam and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butter , a spoon of jam . Nearly five shillings ! " Hugh had meant boldly to order another breakfast each , " but I have n't fourteen Swiss francs , " he said . The French girl left them at Brig and now people got in and out for short distances ; only I-high and Caddie had seemed to be travelling on and on . Their pink papers had been punched so many times that they were soiled and flimsy . The country people were friendly , but their cigarettessmelled , " Awful , " said Caddie . " Pestilential , " said Hugh . All the same , when a man offered him one he smoked it right through with aplomb . " I often smoke at school . " The smell clung to him . Neither of them could wash becausethe water did not run in the lavatories . At the Italian frontier Domodossola , " What a name ! " there were passports and customs but this time even Caddie was quite fearless , and , " We 're in Italy . In Italy , " 144she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was beginning to catch up with them , and the morning became a jumble . The journey seemed to be a pilgrimage of lakes ; one of them was as Caddie had imagined Italy : houses , ochre-walled , dark-tiled ; two islands in the middle of the water , flowers ; magnolias , and what Caddie thought were roses until Hugh told her they were camellia bushes , growing as high as trees . " Is it Garda ? " " No , we have n't got to Milan yet . It 's Maggiore , " and then , almost suddenly , they were in Milan under a domed roof like a hangar , crowds on the platform , shoutings , hissingof steam . It was now that Hugh failed to change the ten-thousandlirenote . On the platform were trolleys , " Selling lovely things , " said Caddie . " And the man would n't take our note . He told us to go to the ticket office , to get change . The ticket office when the train might have gone any second , and we were starving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the train bumped over a flat cultivated plain , by low mountains ; in the distance were others , not low but high and hazy blue , disappearing into cloud . They saw what must have been a monastery on a hill , its cloisters arched ; oxen were ploughingin orchards of blossom , there were little villages , then , " Tidy yourself , " said Hugh . " We 're nearly there . " In the gravelled Desenzano station courtyard edged with begonias , a blue bus had been standing , the bus Fanny had so often heard passing the villa . Beside it a yellow notice board was written in large letters . Hugh and Caddie spelled out the names : " Salo , Gardone , Limone , Riva . " " Not Malcesine ? " asked Caddie , stretched with anxiety. 1 4 5 " This goes the other way round the lake , " but Hugh 's quick eyes had seen another board laid down on top of others . " Sirmione . Garda . Malcesine . Riva . " " That 's the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it go ? " " It 's the next board , so it must be the next bus . They wo n't change ten thousand lire either . I had better take out note to the ticket office . " It seemed an hour to Caddie but in about twenty minutesa second bus rolled up and sure enough , the board went up . " Sirmione . Garda . Malcesine . " They got in . It looked more like a coach than a bus , with its armchair seats in red leather , each with a picture let into its back , its silvered racks and carpeted gangway . The conductor came round . " Malcesine , " said Hugh and held up two fingers . He pronounced it Mal-see-ziny with an accent on the " mal . " " That Teutonic bang , " said Rob . " Mal-see-ziny , " and the conductor did not understand . In the end Hugh had to show his map . " Ah , aah ! Malcesinel " said the man as if it were spelt " Malchesinay , " all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hugh , who never blushed , went red to the back of his ears . It was a long way . They both went uneasily to sleep . There were fleeting impressions of houses and harbours , of roses climbing up trees . " Can that , too , really be true ? " Of swinging away into the mountains , away from the lake , of stopping and going . People jostled and pushed into the bus ; Caddie was surprised at the black pinafores of the school children , even big girls ; Hugh winced at the gutturalGerman of the tourists , his head was hurting . Only146once did they wake right up ; when an English woman who had come nearly all the way from Desenzano with them ate the pork pie and offered Hugh , who was sitting on the outside , a piece . " I thought she was going to give you one , " he told Caddie . " Or I should n't have bolted it like that . " " You were starving too , " said Caddie feelingly . At last , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They got up , but their legs were so stiff that they almostfell ; the bus was not as comfortable as it had looked . I-Iugh lifted down the grips , Caddie brought the coats and bag , and they were left standing on a dusty road bordered with shops . " You got out at Malcesine , " said Fanny . " My poor darlings ! Why the bus goes past our gate . The villa is two kilometres from there . " " I know , " said Hugh . " We know , because we walked . " " What I do n't understand , " said Fanny when it was all told out , " what I do n't understand is where you got the money . You had a few French francs , some Swiss ones , and the notes . You say you put your school money in the desk for compensation , I think that was very honest of you , but you had to pay your fares and in English money . They must have been nearly twenty pounds . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Caddie . " Where did you get it ? " There was a silence . Hugh looked at his feet . Caddie sank lower and lower in her chair until her face was hidden . At last , " Caddie sold Topaz , " said Hugh. 147 " Sold Topaz ! " It was a cry from Fanny . " He had to be sold , " said Hugh . " She could n't keep him in the flat . " The last time he had said that had been in the flat itself . Caddie had been surprised at Hugh 's indifference to the money part of their going . Twenty-three pounds , single by air , which was forty-six pounds for the two of them ; ten pounds four shillings , for Hugh by cheap train , half for herself , at the very least fifteen pounds six shillings , and it mysteriously came to more than that . " Where shall we get so much ? " she had asked innocently , never dreaming of what was coming , until , " I know where , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail that there had been no escape . " Dear Mr. Ringells , " Caddie had written in the script that St. Anne 's enforced . " My father says you would like to buy my pony , Topaz . . . " " I ca n't Hugh . I ca n't write it . " " . . . for twenty-five pounds , " dictated Hugh , and he said , " You must  --  it must be in your writing , because Topazis yours . " " As we have to live in London now we think it would be wise . . . " There were big blots on the page , but Hugh let it go ; perfectionist though he was , even Hugh did not make Caddie write it twice . " My brother and I will come down and see you on Friday , about twelve o'clock . My fatherhas asked me to write this letter . " " Sign it , " said Hugh . " Yours sincerely , Candida Claver-ing . " " Yours sincerely , Candida Clavering , " wrote Caddie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay me1 4 8in cash as I want to buy a tennis racquet and a bicycle . " But Caddie would not write that final treachery . Hugh had to copy her script and write it himself . He had everything planned : " We will tell Gwyneth I 'm taking you down to Whitcross to say good-bye to Topaz beforeschool , " which was true , except the " before school . " It was so reasonable that Gwyneth even gave them the money for their tickets . Topaz was in a stall . Mr. Ringells had brought him in , " So your sister can see him , " he told Hugh , and he said , " Nice little pony . " Nice little pony ! " His legs are muddy , " Caddie whispered to Hugh . " They were muddy at Stebbings , " but there was no denyingTopaz was not the shining little pony he had been under her care . His coat was rough , his ears dusty . " I did n't leave a speck of dust on him . " His feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will get thrush , " she said severely to Mr. Ringells . He had water and hay and was quite plump , but , " Do you ever give him carrots ? " Her eyes searched Mr. Ringells ' face as if they would rake out of him what kind of man he was . " Apples or sugar ? " " He gets plenty of petting from the children . Never you fear , " said Mr. Ringells , but Caddie did fear . " He will be a riding-school pony , not anybody 's own , " she said . She spoke once in the train on the way back . " He 's used to being loved . What will he think ? " and Hugh gave her a piece of advice . " For people , it 's much better never to think what animals must be thinking . " Then he did somethingthat Caddie had only known him do once before ; he put his arm round her and squeezed her . Long ago , on the149day he went to that first school , suddenly turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caddie a violent wordless hug . The small far-away Caddie had been filled with love and wonder . In the Whitcross train she felt nothing at all . Now , on the villa terrace , it was Fanny who was weeping . She had jumped up . " Caddie , we must get Topaz back , make Mr. Ringells sell him back to us . Rob and I will have a house soon and probably in the country . We will buy Topaz back , wherever he is , and keep him for you . I promise , " but the figure bowed in the chair at the end of the table never moved and Rob stopped Fanny . " I should leave her alone just now . " " But you do n't know what this means , Rob . " " I can guess . " " Hugh , how could you ? How could you ? " " What do you mean , how could I ? " Hugh 's head came up . He looked fierce . " It was n't I who made Caddie sell Topaz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Precisely , " said Rob before Fanny could cry out . They were getting into a tangle of emotions and he made the words brisk . " All the same , we must n't promise what we ca n't do . By the time we find a house , Caddie may be too big for a pony and . . . " but Fanny could not bear the way Caddie sat silently bowed in the chair . She broke away from Rob , and went to Caddie , kneelingdown by her . " Perhaps we ca n't buy Topaz back , " she said . " But I shall never forget , never , what you have done to get to me . To sell Topaz . " Fanny 's voice was broken . " And that long long journey . " She held out her hand to1 5 0I high . " Oh my darlings , if you knew what it means . . that you ran away to me . " Ilugh was silent but Caddie raised an indignant face . " Wr did n't run away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fetch you . " VIITH E SILENCE that greeted Caddie 's words was like a challenge : nobody answered her , nobody commented ; Fanny got up and went back to her chair . Rob 's face was expressionless but presently he asked , " Your father should be back today ? " " He was supposed to come last night . " " Then he should have had my telegram . " Fanny turned in sudden alarm . " Rob , what did you say in it ? " " That I was putting Hugh and Caddie on the plane at Milan this evening . " " This evening ? No , Rob . " " Yes . There 's a plane that leaves Milan at six-twentyfive . It 's not that we do n't want you , " lie said to Hugh and Caddie . " Of course we do and we hope you will come back , but , you see , it has to be with permission . " " Rob ! " It was a wail . " After all that ? " " After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was so brave and enterprising . " " It was enterprising . " Hugh was glad that Rob dismissedthe bravery . " Enterprising , but wrong , legally and morally , and we must n't encourage it . " 152 " Hugh looks ill , Rob . Not fit to travel . " " One more night wo n't hurt him . It 's a short flight . " At Fanny 's unhappy face he softened . " We made a bargain , dear . " " I did n't make a bargain . " " You did when you let the divorce go through . " And he said more gently , " We must leave at three-thirty . You must have them ready . " " I ca n't . " " You must . " " I ca n't . " " Then I must . Caddie , you had better get that dress ironed again and are your shoes clean ? If not , Hugh can . . . " but Hugh had got up , his hands clasped to his stomach . He gave a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushed to the balustrade and began to retch . Before Fanny could reach him , he was violently sick , " All down the roses , " said Caddie . " Are you sure he 's not malingering ? " Darrell 's far-away voice on the telephone was curtly hostile  --  naturally , thought Rob . That the children should run away too must have been a cruel cut . Rob could imagine the chagrin was worst over Hugh ; even though he was at odds with Darrell , males should stand together . Run to his mother ! Darrell , of course , did not know the reason . " I do n't think he could malinger as seriously as this , " said Rob . " He has food pois  --  " but he was interrupted . " I am always suspicious of Hugh . " 153Rob was suspicious too , but , " The doctor says . . . " he began . " He can twist his mother round his little finger , I warn you . She is foolish about that boy . Wrap him up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He ca n't travel . " " They look after you very well on these planes ; Caddie is with him and I can meet them . " " He ca n't travel , " said Rob more loudly . " Why not ? " and Rob almost shouted . " He 's being sick . He has diarrhoea and fever . " " Are you sure ? " " You ought to be here , " said Rob . The whole Fiorita had been turned upside down . Rob and Fanny had got Hugh upstairs , Celestina and Giulietta running after with basins and towels , exclamations and confused orders , while Caddie waited , pale with fright , on the stairs . It was like convulsions ; Hugh 's light body seemed torn apart with retching , then doubled up with the spasms of diarrhoea . Fanny had been calm and efficient , and as fierce as a tiger , thought Rob . Giulietta had been told peremptorily to be quiet , Celestina to help hold Hugh , Rob to go over to the hotel and telephone the doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Doctor Isella is coming . He will be here in a few min-utes . " " Doctor Isella ? " and Fanny , to whom Italy had become all that was good , turned unexpectedly insular . " Is n't there an English doctor ? Or at least an American ? " " Italian doctors are among the best in the world , " said Rob but he could see she did not believe him. 154 " I ca n't even speak to him . " " I can . " Under her calmness , Rob could feel the tension and remorse . " Hugh will be all right , dear . " It was odd that it was his comforting that brought an edge of hysteria into her competence . " It will be my fault , my fault if he is n't . " " Nonsense , " said Rob . " It was his fault for eating that piece of pie . Caddie did n't . " " Italian food , I suppose , " Darrell had said on the telephone . " It was English actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman on the bus gave him a piece of pork pie . At least we think it must have been that . It was the only thing he ate that Caddie did n't . " Fanny had been icily furious over Darrell 's remarks . " Malingering ! How dare he say that . He has never been fair to Hugh , never . How could he put on sickness like this , a high temperature ? " " Not high , darling . Only a hundred and two . " " Only ! That is high for food poisoning . Doctor Isella . . . " and she accused Rob . " You take Darrell 's part because he 's a man . " " I do n't . Hugh 's a sick boy . " " Then how could he put it on ? " Rob did not know , nor did Caddie , yet she , like her father , was not sure . It was Hugh 's luck , of course , but how did he attract the luck ? Caddie privately thought he could do anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word . " By lunchtime Doctor Isella had stopped the sickness ; his155injections , charcoal pills , potions of weak tea were beginning to wash away the effects of the pie . " Short and sharp , " said Doctor Isella , who did speak English . Hugh was weak , still fevered , full of headache , hollow-eyed , tenderskinned , and filthy-tongued but it was over . When Caddie tiptoed into the room  --  he had been moved into the big bedroom  --  she had seen his eye peeping out from under the compress on his forehead and the eye had a glint , authenticallyHugh . " Hullo , Hugh . " " Hullo . " It was a croak . " You 're better ? " " Not dead yet , " and he whispered . " At least it 's put paid to them pushing us off back . " " You are very , very clever , " said Caddie earnestly . " Clever ! " Fanny 's voice came from behind her . " What is clever about an attack of poisoning ? What is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is diab  --  " " Devilish , " said Hugh and winked . The wink heartened Caddie , who was very much dismayed . She could not know the chaos in Fanny ; the contrition and guilt over their journey , over the selling of Topaz , Hugh 's illness , the feeling that Rob was criticizing her , and a subtle dislike of herself for feeling an echo of what Rob had said , to her , " Children are always welcome . " " At any time ? " Rob had said and though Fanny would not admit it , Hugh and Caddiewere an interruption . Caddie could not know this , it only seemed to her that Fanny was too angry , " Too angry for what I said , " and she mumbled , " I only meant . . . " 1 5 6 " Yes , what did you mean ? " " I meant , Rob  --  Mr. Quillet  --  said we had to go and now we can stay here . " " Not you , " said Fanny . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back , " Darrell had said . " Alone ? " Rob had asked . " Would n't that be rather dis-mal ? " " Dismal ? " The word was barked down the telephone . " Yes , " said Rob . " She 's unhappy as it is . " After a hesitationhe added , " You know she sold her pony , Topaz , to get here . " That produced a pause ; then , " I wondered how they got the money . " The implication seemed to sink in . " The devil they did ! What business . . . " which made Rob ask , out of sheer mischief , " Was n't it her pony ? I thought she won it , " and Darrell had said , more curtly than ever , " She must come back . She 's missing school . " Fanny 's anger could not last when she saw Caddie 's stricken face . " I 'm sorry , darling , but Father insists on it  --  he can , you know . Rob is taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car Caddie sat as far away from Rob as she could get and kept her face turned away to the window . Fanny had mistaken her frozen silence for fright . " You will be quite all right . Rob will speak to the air hostess and Father will be waiting for you at London airport . " Rob seemed to understand the silence , and respect it ; he did not try and beguile her with talk as most adults would have done , but drove in a silence as deep as her own . For Caddie the silence was partly shock . Until Rob had157issued his edict on the terrace , it had not occurred to her that they could be returned . Indeed , and childishly as she saw now , she had expected Fanny to decide straight away to come back to England with them . Expected ? Took it for granted was nearer , as if the sight of them , or at any rate of Hugh , would have been enough . Now she was beginning to see that it could not happen without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if I could have started fighting , thought Caddie in despair . " I 'm here , " Hugh would have said . " Do n't you trust me ? " but Caddie , unwillingly , did not ; if Hugh grew to like Rob , and she had to concede that would be easy , he might go over , thought Caddie . She stole a glance at Rob as he drove , looking ahead . His eyes were hidden by dark glasses so that he looked masked and he was all alien to Caddie : the darkness of his sallow skin , his head with the hair growing so far back that he was almost bald in front  --  I never knew someone bald could be attractive . People 's faces , Philippa said , were divided into horses , birds , and puddings . Rob 's , with its leannessand curved nostrils , was unmistakably a horse , which perhaps was why , in spite of herself , he appealed to Caddie . She looked at his wrists coming out from the silk shirtcuff , strong brown wrists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the wheel . They did not have the big knuckles , the thick skin she , Darrell 's daughter , had alwaysassociated with a man , yet they were a man 's hands for all their fineness , big , strong-looking , with , on the left one , a little finger ring with a dull green carved stone . She would have liked to ask what the carving was but she would not speak to Rob . There was no doubt that he was158a stronger enemy than they had dreamed and it seemed she had really sold Topaz for nothing . A tear rolled out of Caddie 's eye and slid down her nose but , with her face turned away to the window , she thought Rob did not see . He did not need to see . Disquiet had been growing in him ever since the bravado of that first hour when he had taken Fanny away to San Vigilio , disquiet and a misery against which he had to tighten his mind ; and he thought firmly , even if I am guilty I will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was , though , nothing he could do to make either of them feel better and he drove on in silence . All round them the brightness of the Venetian spring unrolled ; neither of them saw it . Rob did not comment when they swung onto the autostrada and he paid at the gate , and Caddie said nothing when the speedometer needlemoved up to eighty-five , ninety , a hundred kilometres . They by-passed towns and suburbs , came through a large factory town and then to the suburbs of Milan itself . Rob said then , " We 're nearly at the airport . Just think ! Two hours from the take-off , you will be in London . " To Caddiethis was only another proof of the way adults could blot one 's efforts out . Two hours ! To reduce that aeon of uncomfortable , dirty , hungry , and frightening travel to that ! " Then it will be all over , " said Rob . He meant it to be comforting but Caddie said nothing at all . " And you will come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holidays . " " Thank you , " said Caddie , " but that will be too late . " " Too late ? " " Mother will have married you by then . " 159After that , at the airport too , they sat far away from one another . The little temporary airport was crowded and Rob was suddenly resentful . The crowds , the stark white light , the rasping loudspeaker voices , the ashtray stands with their stale whiffs of smoke , the bins of dirtied cardboard cups , the scattered cellophane wrappings and newspapers on the floor , were hideous . Tired children staggered and cried , mothers scolded in voices like amplified hens , thought Rob ; men argued , older children played and shouted . It seemed a day-nightmare and  --  I should have been at the Fiorita , he thought , with the peace of a day 's work done : Fanny waiting for me alone on the terrace : a look at our star , a walk perhaps in the garden , a drink , dinner , and here , because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His voice was terse as he tried to be kind to Caddie . She knew he was trying to be kind and she was even terser . " Would you like some coffee ? Lemonade , before your flight ? " " No thank you . " " A sandwich ? An ice would be better  --  it 's fearsomely hot . An ice ? " " No thank you . " " A magazine ? Or would n't you like a book ? " There was a small kiosk and he said , " Look . That little silver model is Milan cathedral . You could take that home to show where you have been ? An Italian peasant doll ? One of those souvenirs ? " Caddie did not even answer . The brown eyes flicked a glance at his tactlessness and went back to their fixed look . Rob had seen that look before , on a famine child in India , 16odoomed hopelessness ; but that 's exaggerated , he thought angrily . Caddie is neither hopeless nor doomed . She is goingback to a father who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caddie still did not take that look off her face . " Listen , " he wanted to say . " This all seems dreadful now but it will be all right , " or " When you are older you will understand . " Even , " Forgive me . You see I love your mother , " but in the face of that look they were easy phrases , empty comfort . And why should n't she hate me , poor little toad , thought Rob . He ended by saying nothing but sat looking at his hands , turning them over , examining the fingers while Caddie , at the other end of the bench , looked at her feet in her brown walking shoes that were nearly as flat and large as her sandals . " British European Airways announce the departure of Flight 507 for London . Will passengers please .. . " " This is for you , " said Rob . " Come along , " and , picking up the grip Fanny had packed , he led the way to the customs barrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she heard him begin to the girl in her pale blue suit and cocked cap . " She has her passport , tickets , and five pounds in English money , " and to Caddie , " You just follow the blue lights . Here 's your grip . Good-bye . " " Good-bye , " and , " I should have left then , " said Rob to Fanny later . " Not stayed to watch her out of sight . " The corridor from the barrier to the customs and waitingrooms was long . Other passengers walked with Caddie , around her and past her , almost brushing over her : Italian businessmen in heavy suits , black hats , with opulentpigskin brief cases : women in high heels that tapped briskly , their arms laden with coats , handbags , bucket bags , 16imagazines . Two walked each side of Caddie as if she were not there , one bumping her with a bandbox . Carrying her raincoat , the grip swinging , she looked small and unprotected in the skimpy green checked frock , green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to a school where the uniform is n't so ugly ? thought Rob irritably . The irritation was no good , already his heart was betraying him ; the back of her arms looked so young , and unexpectedly thin , " Like a lamb 's bones , " he told Fanny . One of the women , turning to speak to a man , brushed Caddie in the face with the coat she carried  --  and did n't apologize , thought Rob , which made him unreasonably hot with indignation . Ca n't they see she 's only a child , and travelling alone ? But Caddie was too old , and too young , to arouse any interest and she only turned her head away and went on , though Rob saw that even her buttocks shrank from the women and once again Rob was reminded of a small bullock , but this time driven down the ramp . He seemed to have a whole menagerie of animals for Caddie . It was her helplessness , he thought irritably . At the far end of the corridor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to startle Caddie . She put the grip down between her feet  --  in case it should be stolen ? thought Rob  --  and began to search through her wallet . The ticket and passport were not there . " In your blazer pocket , " Rob wanted to shout but he was too far away . The air hostess was standing , not looking at Caddie but over her head to where two other passengers were fumbling with their papers , her hand held out ; it was automatic , Rob knew , but it looked relentless and he could see Caddie was getting in a panic . She began toi 6 2search through the raincoat pockets , holding it out . The other passengers began to chafe , a man pushed past her , " And suddenly , " Rob told Fanny afterwards , " I could n't stand it any longer . I ran back to the desk . I had signed for her as her stepfather , " he told Fanny . " Stepfather ! " Fanny sounded as if that were a shock . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I suppose that 's what we have to call me , " said Rob . " They thought I was mad , of course , but they spoke over the loudspeaker and Caddie was fished out and given back to me . " She had been stunned by being made to go , now she was shocked . " But . . . they will be very angry with you , " she said . " I expect they will , " said Rob . " I 'm a fool . " Fanny later was to probe . " But why ? " she asked bewildered . " Why ? " " God knows , " said Rob . That answer would have satisfied Caddie . This sudden intervention was in Greek-god style . The face she turned to Rob when he announced they were going back to the Villa Fiorita was still white but transformed , luminous , eyes shining . Rob did not flatter himself it was happiness ; it was only relief . He hoped that the sudden hollow feelingin himself was only hunger and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " Caddie , shall we sink our differences , just for an hour , and have dinner to-gether ? " " You took her to the Continentale ? Caddie ! " " Why not ? " i 6 3 " In those dreadful clothes ? " " The clothes did n't matter and the dining room there is good . " " But what a waste . " " I was there too , " said Rob , " and it was n't a waste . She enjoyed it . " He corrected himself . " We enjoyed it . " Caddie had not been in such a hotel before . Coming from the foyer , with its rows of desk clerks  --  they bowed to Rob as if they knew him  --  and into the immense marblepillaredlounge she had felt as if she had walked into a palace and , shaken out of herself , she was still as transformedas in that miracle moment at the airport ; like the princess in the fairy tale who shook off the frog , thought Rob . He liked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the brown eyes that were so like Fanny 's took in the room with its white arches , pale walls , great baskets of flowers . The next table had been made ready for a party with small vases of pale pink tulips , " One for every person ! " said Caddie , and iii its centre a miniaturefountain bubbled pale pink water . " A fountain on a table ! " she said . She looked a little askance at the knives , forks , and glasses arranged in front of her , the size and starchiness of the napkin the waiter unfurled and laid across her knees , but her manners were so naturally polite and modest  --  " Like yours , " Rob told Fanny . " You did very well with her there "  --  that there was none of the gaucheness of every day . " Yes , Caddie can rise to an occasion , " said Fanny . Looking across the table , Rob had seen , for the first time , some promise of beauty in this ugly duckling ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloom that had come up under the freckles , and those will fade , 1 6 the thought . Her hair , under the shaded lights , had points of gold in its ginger which looked a deep red brown , and her eyes , tonight , were astonishing ; but Rob was too hungryto look for long at Caddie and they ate , " Extraordinarythings , " as she told Hugh afterwards . " There were artichoke hearts with brains "  --  " Ugh ! " said Hugh  --  " a mixed grill of fish with squids , tiny octopus , and prawns and mussels , veal cooked in wine . " " At ten o'clock at nightl " said Fanny . " It was ten o'clock , " said Rob . " Remember I had to arrangea message to Darrell at London Airport . I tried to telephone him but could n't . That took two hours . Caddie wanted to go to the ladies ' room , that seemed perpetual , " said Rob unfairly . " Then we had to drive to Milan . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is Italy , " said Rob patiently . " In Rome we never dine before half past ten . " Dinner had just ended when something happened to Caddie that she , child of Fanny and Darrell , had not experienced before : she was forgotten . A man came into the restaurant , an Italian , she thought , looking at his small , thick-set body , his hair that was cut in a crew cut , thick and brown , his eyes black as berries in a sunburned face . They searched the room as he stood for a moment in the entrance , then lit up as he caught sight of Rob . " Rob ! They told me you were here . " " Aldo ! " Rob had jumped up . " This is wonderful ! Wonderfull " Then they sat down . " I have been sending you telegrams all afternoon . Renato says there is no telephone at that tiresome villa . " 1 6 5 " None , thank God , " said Rob . " But that 's impossible . " Rob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aldo , ringing up . " As Aldo looked at Rob , the bright eyes were very friendly . " You are happy , Rob ? " " Happier than I could have imagined , " and Aldo stretched out a hand and squeezed Rob 's arm . Then , for a brief moment , Rob did remember Caddie . " Caddie , this is Prince Brancati . " Did Rob say prince ? As a well-trained child , she had stood up ; now she wondered if she ought to curtsy , but the prince shook hands with her and that was the last time they remembered her  --  " For hours , " said Caddie . Prince Brancati was , Fanny told her afterwards , one of the many strange and floating people attached to Rob 's work . She had already learned that every picture seemed to have them . What were they ? Producers ? Associate producers ? " I do n't know but it 's something to do with the money part , " said Fanny vaguely , " which is probably why they seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But Prince Aldo "  --  Caddie could not remember Brancati  --  " saidhe had n't any money . " It . was one of the things he said . " I have no money , Rob , " and lie spread his hands out like that . " He knows the people who have , and he has big estates and a castle , " said Fanny . Now he bestowed a fleeting smile on Caddic and turned back to Rob . " Tonight is Rigolctlo and I heard today , only today at four o'clock , that Renata Scotto , the Gilda , is ill . They have flown the little Letti up from Rome . Bianca1 6 6Letti . You remember my telling you ? She is ver-y ver-y pretty . " He tapped Rob 's arm to emphasize this . " Beautiful , besides the voice . She is singing Gilda . Gildal tonight . It 's a unique chance . " He looked at his watch . " We could be in time for the third act . Guido will let us in , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " and he lapsed into Italian ; a stream of it went from him to Rob , from Rob to him , over Caddie 's head . If they must go , why do n't they ? she thought , but no , the waiter brought more coffee , brandies , a cigar for the prince and still they sat on talking , talking . Caddie feared she was growing sleepy and put her elbows on the table , stretching her eyes open with her fingers , but her eyes still seemed to have an annoying way of curling up at the corners . She suddenly and unexpectedly gave an enormous yawn . Made awake by shame , she glanced at Rob to see if he had seen but he and Prince Aldo were still talking , cigarette and cigar smoke curling between them , Rob 's fingers flickingaway the ash as if he were excited . She was forced to intrude . She was growing more and more uncomfortable , trying not to wriggle on her chair . At last , " Mr. Quillet  --  Rob , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please Rob . . . Rob , I must . " and the prince broke off . " Rob , she is asking you . . " " Rob , is there a ladies ' room here ? " She said it far too loudly and blushed but the waiter had understood and was motioning her to follow him across the floor . " Wait . " Rob fished in his pocket and brought out a note . " Give this to the signorina . " 167 " But . . . Mother gave me some pennies . " " Give the signorina this , " and he turned back to the prince . He was right . She did not need the pennies and the ladies ' room was not at all like the airport . It was as full of grandeur and marble as the lounge ; even the cubicleswere pale glossy pink and there were marble basins , hot water , immaculate small towels , a signorina in black with starched lace cuffs . Washed and feeling very much better , Caddie returned . She had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were still talking . At last the bill was brought , a pile of the outsize Italian notes put on the plate , and they stood up . The kind waiter brought her things . She had not time to pick them up properly ; if he had not whisked her past the table to the door , she was sure she would have been left : behind . The men had gone , still talking , and she , with her coat and grip trailing , ran after them through the marble lounge and hall , past all the people , out into the noisy Milanese night . The street was full of traffic , the pavements swarming , trams clanking past , as Caddie hurried after Rob and the prince , dodging people or bumping into them , coming up short at a traffic light where a roan flung out an arm to stop her , then running to catch up with them , but they had not far to walk before they turned into a big creamcolouredportico hung with theatre bills . There had been only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exhausting days , and now Caddie was so dogged with tiredness and filled with good food , that the night began to behave like a dream , in which things came nearer and then went away , swelled up into distinctness and faded , with curious blanks in be-1 6 8tween . She remembered standing in a lit space , thick carpetingunder her feet , an impression of mahogany , brass , marble , crystal , while the prince and Rob talked with a tall man in evening dress whose name seemed to be Guido . Do all Italian men 's names end in o ? asked Caddie 's tired brain  --  Aldo , Renato , Giacomino , Mario ? Women in a ? Celestina , Giulietta , and now this Bianca of whom they were all talking . Or was she a woman ? A coloratura , they said ; it sounded to Caddie like a cockatoo . Then they were in a wide corridor , cream-walled with countless little cream doors lettered in gold . They were led by another man in black , wearing a heavy silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mice , with chains around their necks " . . . but this was a man , not a mouse . Was it true ? thought Caddie , or was she dreaming ? The man opened one of the doors , someone whispered , " : Silenzio . Fate silenzio . Absolute quiet , " and she was steered into what at first seemed darkness , a red darkness and a din of sound . She felt hardness , covered in velvet against her hands , that was the rim of a box ; velvet against her legs , and found a chair into which she sank , though first she had almost sat on the floor . Then before her opened a width of light , so violently lighted that her eyes could not take it in , yet below the light , they caught what seemed to be hundreds of movements . After a moment she saw they were movements of arms working , hands holding the bows of violins , cellos , violincellos , basses , fingers working on them and on wind instruments , a hand poised over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hands held still on harpstrings where a harp frame1 6 9caught the light . It was a huge orchestra pit and , " You were in La Scala , " Fanny told her afterwards . " What is La Scala ? " " The most famous opera house in the world , " but the ignorant Caddie did not really know what opera was . " A play , stupid , " said Hugh . " When all the words , or most of the words , are sung . " " Why ? " asked Caddie and she could have said , " We did n't go to a play . We went to look at Bianca Letti and hear her sing . " That much Caddie had fathomed . Rob was looking at Bianca Letti , hearing tier , for the part of Berengaria , in something called Saladin . " Just look at her , Rob . That is all , " Prince Aldo had pleaded . " Just look at her . " At first Caddie was deafened . They were almost on top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . They were so close to the stage that when her eyes did grow accustomed , she could see the cracks in the paint of the scenery , the lines of the floorboards , the crease in the Duke 's top boots , powder on his slashed sleeves , the make-up on the singers ' faces , particularly white as flour on the hunchback 's . Guido told her he was Rigoletto though who and what Rigoletto was she did not know . While Prince Aldo and Rob whispered together , Guido did pay some attention to Caddie . " 1 ? nrico Rufini is singingRigoletto , " he whispered , which added to the confusion . On the stage was what seemed to be a hut , brightly lit , and a great stone bridge outside a wall with cypresses ; Caddie recognized those from the villa garden . Inside the 7 0but was a young man , " The Duke , " whispered Guido , and a woman in red and yellow striped skirts , a red shawl over a white blouse , red beads , a fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered again and Prince Aldo turned his head and said , quite loudly , " She is nothing . " Outside the hut , the hunchback in a long cape swung and lumberedabout the stage and with him was a girl , young , with a golden plait that hung over the shoulder of her long grey cloak . Its hood made a frame for a small face , and Caddie could see it was indeed very , very pretty . When it lifted , there was a flash from a pair of great dark eyes . " That is Gilda , Bianca Letti . " Caddie was aware now of a sea of heads below her , the auditorium , and of honeycombed tiers of boxes like the one they were in , rising up to the roof with gleams of deep rose , deep red . " On gala nights , " Guido told her in his soft whisper , " it is all carnations . On the front of every box is a wreath , carnations everywhere , but then it is not opera , " said Guido @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisper had carried and , " Ssh ! Basta ! " someone hissed from the box next door . The orchestra seemed to take a breath and as a rocket soars up and bursts into a rain of coloured stars , it burst into music , gay , pronounced , and the fat young man in the thigh boots and doublet , the Duke , began to sing . At the end , the clapping burst too , but Caddie , her hands between her knees , her face fixedly turned to the stage waited as if she were mesmerized , waited through the recitative until , once again , there was that breath . Then the four began to sing together , Gilda and Rigoletto1 7 1outside the hut , the Duke and Maddalena in . " The quartet , Bella figlia dell'amore , " said Guido . " What is dell'amore ? " Caddie 's whisper was too loud and , " Ssh ! Basta , " came even more fiercely . She shrank with shame but Rob , as if he had suddenly remembered her , put his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Gilda 's notes , " he said . Listen to Gilda . Caddie could not understand a word of what they sang , nor did she know what the opera was about , except that the hunchback and Gilda seemed in terrible distress but as she listened to those four voices , it was as if a skin parted in her mind , something tight and stretched in which she had been sealed and against which her unhappiness had boiled and seethed . For days she had been too small a Caddie for all that was in her . " I have grown too big for me , " she could have said . Now she escaped , let out on the sound of that music , sound that she could not have believed . Oddly enough , it was to do with Topaz . What could a little pony in England have to do with singing in Milan ? Yet , mysteriously , she seemed to be stroking Topaz 's neck again ; his mole warmness had vibratedand flowed under her hand , as this singing vibratedand flowed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pony but life itself . Up and up went Gilda 's voice and Caddie seemed to be going with it as if she were one of Cclestina 's birds let out of its cage . Then Rigoletto 's and the Duke 's blended with Gilda 's , Maddalena 's came up in such an orgy of sound that Caddie was lost , yet still she knew it was there ; the bigness could not be split up , not into an individual girl1 7 2and her pony , into a man 's or woman 's voice . The pony was more important than the girl , the song than the singers . Caddie sensed that  --  and how few people sense it  --  but it and they were one . It was all a oneness and  --  everything is everything , thought Caddie certainly , on the tide of that singing . It was only a few minutes , a glimpse . Afterwards it was as if , for a moment , she had laid her hand on truth , tried to grasp it and her hand was empty  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . The quartet ended , there was a thunder of clapping , and Caddie was once again a small alien girl who had somehow got into this box . Nor did she catch another glimpse again , in the rest of the singing . She was interested in the stage storm , in the way the cypresses really bent and shook but the washing on the roof did not shake enough , she thought critically but slowly emotion , dinner , and tiredness overcame her , the tide of sound on the stage seemed to sink away and she must have gone to sleep . She woke with clapping ringing in her ears , clapping and shouting . The lights had gone on and the singers were bowing in front of a vast velvet curtain , carnations were being thrown down  --  forever afterwards , carnations , for Caddie , meant Milan  --  some hit the singers ' heads , the front of the stage was strewn , but she could not stay to look . The men were leaving the box . She was just in time to stumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blinking in the brilliance of the corridor she asked , " Rob , are we going home ? " " Going round , " said Rob . She had not time to ask , " Go-1 7 3ing round what ? " because they were already walking away , one of them each side of Rob , talking , gesticulating . " We shall be quicker , " Guido was saying , " to go outside and in at the stage door . " Once more they were out on the street , threading through a cafe of little tables half hidden by trees in tubs , while the crowd milled round the Scala entrance . Then they turned down a side street into a paved courtyard where cars were waiting ; Guido spoke to a man in a grey uniform and led them up a flight of stone stairs , Caddie 's legs aching as she tried to keep up , through a great many doors and rooms until , " We 're on the stage ! " cried Caddie . It seemed to her eyes enormous . A glug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were being wheeled into position , others were going down through the floor  --  again was she dreaming or was it real ? But again too she could not stay to look ; as it was she had to scamperover the bare boards to catch the others but , I have been on a stage , a stage , thought Caddie .  --  en Philippa had never done that . They climbed another staircase , went through more doors until they came to a pair of heavy swing ones and here they stepped into quiet , a small rich corridor , with a dark red carpet  --  and two dear little chandeliers , thought Caddie . She was wide awake now . The corridor was lined with mahogany doors at one of which Guido knocked . It was opened a crack , Guido had a whispered conversation , the door was opened wide , and they all went in . It was a box of a dressing room , mahogany again , with a sofa covered in old gold velvet and gold velvet chairs to1 7 4match . Down one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman in a white overall was hanging up the doublet and cape of lavender velvet that Gilda had just worn . There were other dresses , a shelf of crowns , a cap of pearls , from which hung a plait of gold hair ; Gilda 's plait , then , did not belong to Bianca Letti . The room was full . " Who were all those people ? " Caddie asked Rob afterwards . " Bianca 's mother and grandmother , " said Rob , " and every relation she has living in Milan . " The grandmothersat in state in a chair . One of the men was eating a roll split with sausage and a little boy was playing with a carnation , perhaps one of those that had fallen on Gilda 's head . He was not more than three or four years old , and , " It must have been nearly midnight , " Caddie told Fanny . Then , from an inner room , Gilda or Bianca came out , not dressed but wearing a short little dressing gown of white nylon with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That astonished Caddie . Even Philippa would not have conic out in front of strangers like that , but the cold cream did not disguise Bianca 's beauty , " And for a prima donna to be beautiful is extremely rare , " Rob was to tell Caddie . Bianca was also shy  --  but Rob talked to her in a soothing , gentle voice . Caddie noticed how the other men , the whole room , became silent , from respect , she thought , and presently Bianca sat down with Rob and began to talk too , but all the while Rob 's eyes were examining and watching her just like the judges with a pony at a show , thought Caddie . The powder in the air made Caddie sneeze , her eyes were stinging from tiredness , but it did not seem as if the 7 5night were over yet . The voices were in full spate . There was a suitcase in the corner . She sat down on it to wait . Next morning Celestina , going out to hang her birdcagesin the magnolia tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Signora . " It was only an argument , " said Fanny . She insisted it was not a real quarrelbut it began to sound like a quarrel . " , 8 rientrato alle tre ! At three o'clock ! " said Celestina to Mario who , on his way to clean the Mercedes , paused to listen too . " Three o'clock . L'ho redito , I heard him , " said Mario . " English ladies no allow that , " said Celestina . " E chi sposerebbe una Inglese ! " said Mario , but Celestinaand Mario were not just . Fanny had not even reproachedRob  --  not about that . It was when Giulietta brought their coffee , up to their room , " The Signor was so late , " Fanny had said and , " Un altro piatto e una tazza , " she said in her halting Italian , " Another cup and plate . For Hugh , per 11 Signorino . " " A per la piccola Signorina ? " asked Giulietta . " Mees Caddie . " Fanny stared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Non e in Inghilterra , e a letto . . . in beds , " said Giuliettawith a great effort . " In bed ? " asked Fanny incredulously . " Si , si , " and Rob woke up and explained and Fanny had exploded into something like wrath . " But three o'clock in the morning , Rob , when a child was with you ! " " I had her with me , " said Rob , " and it did n't hurt her. 1 7 6She slept part of the time . Of course she had had some wine . " " You gave her wine ? " " This is Italy , where we do n't keep our children under glass . " He sat up and saw her angry face . " What is the matter ? You 're not a puritan , Fan . " He looked at her more closely . " My darling goose , you 're jealous . " " , Jealous of Caddie ? Do n't be ridiculous , " but Fanny was jealous , humiliatingly , violently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . The villa without him , even with Hugh there , had been desolate and there had been practical difficulties too . She had not known what to do about Prince Brancati 's telegram , and Celestina had gone on keeping dinner hot . At eleven o'clock Fanny had sent Mario over to the Hotel Lydia to telephone the airport . Mario came back ; Flight 507 had left on time . Then Fanny had had to sit calmly while Celestina told her of the terrible accidents there had been on the autostrada and on the lake road . " Italian driver all bad , " declared Celestina comfortingly . " Signor millet drive much fast , too fast . " She told graphically how a bus had pushed a car over the road edge . " Here , by Malcesine . Three people kill . " She held up three fingers . " All deaded . " Fanny sat through it but after Celestina had gone she paced the floor , until the villa itself seemed to check her . Its chatelaines , it seemed to suggest , should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would have kept Celestina in her place , nor would she have paced . " You can not have it all ways , " Fanny told herself . If Darrell had said he would be back at eleven , he1 7 7would have been ; that reliability was not in Rob . Well , you love his quicksilver quality , thought Fanny . He has probably met someone , or something has turned up to do with work , man 's business . " Keep to a woman 's , " Fanny told herself and made herself go upstairs , have a bath , give her hair a good brushing , look in on Hugh , then find a book and go to bed . " Then if anything has happened , you will be fit to deal with it . If it has n't , this is where Rob will want to find you . " " Never be tiresome . " Fanny felt that could have been Madame Menghini 's motto . Fanny was not tiresome  --  then . In fact she had been asleep when Rob came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Did you meet someone ? Tell me . " she murmured half asleep . " In the morning . " He kissed her . " Sleep now , " and she had gone back to sleep never dreaming . . . " But it was you who insisted that Caddie and Hugh must go at once , " she said bewildered . " I changed my mind . People do . " Rob was sitting up in bed . " Give me some coffee . " " But what made you ? " Fanny still asked . " What made you change ? " " Caddie . " He leaned over and patted her hand . " She is so like you . " " Like me ? " Fanny was touched , tlicn she could not help the jealousy coming again . " Nonsense . Except for her hair and eyes , Caddie is Darrell all over again . " " No one is anyone all over again , " said Rob . " There are always contradictions , " and yet Caddie seemed to him almostpure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him always seemed Xoung and vulnerable , X78something innocent . Fanny , for all the airs she put on over her children , would never grow out of that . " She has your smile , " Rob could have said only he would not , that shy flickering smile that had charmed him across Margot 's dinner table ; to see it repeated on a child 's face made his heart turn over with tenderness , but Fanny was in no mood now for tenderness and when they came to Hugh a quarrel began . " I did n't see , " said Rob , " why Caddie should n't go back with Hugh this evening or tomorrow . " Fanny sat up in her chair . " Hugh ca n't go back today or tomorrow . " " Fanny , he must . You say he has no fever now . It 's over . " " It may be over but he 's weak , and Darrell would send him straight back to school . " " And if he did , would that be wrong ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been delicate . He has n't any stamina . " Darrell 's " I warn you , Fanny is foolish about that boy " echoed in Rob 's ear but he tried to argue gently . " Schools have matrons , trained nurses to look after the boys . Doctor Isella said . . . " " Doctor Isella does n't know , " said Fanny , " and after all , you do n't know , Rob , because you never went to one , how tough an English public school can be . Strode is one of the toughest . I always think that 's why Darrell choseit . ) " Hugh seems to be a bone of contention , does n't he ? " said Rob . " Please give me some more coffee , " but Fanny was holding her hands together in distress . " Do n't make me send him back until he 's well . Not for1 7 9a few days . " Again there was a note almost of hysteria in her voice . " Fanny , you are not going to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not if you let me do what I want , " she said and took his cup . " That 's honest , anyhow . " Rob was feeling too contented to argue . He watched the steam going up from his filled cup , a curl of fragrant steam catching the light . Reflections of the lake rippled gently along the walls , the sun shone on Fanny 's hair , her clear skin . He was , too , full of Saladin and of Bianca Letti . She would make a ravishing Berengaria  --  ifwe can get her . She would have to be released but Aldo has influence  --  this had given him a new impetus . He wanted to get up and work , not stay here arguing , and , " I suppose a few days wo n't make any difference , " he said . " We can tell Darrell that Doctor Isella . . . " " Darrell wo n't believe an Italian doctor . " At that Rob 's temper flared . " Godl You middle-class English ! " Fanny 's tautness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by any means . Lady Candida . . . " Damn Lady Candida , " and Rob said , " His behaviour is middle class ; stuffy , conventional , prejudiced , and ig-norant . " " Like mine , I suppose ? " They were facing each other over the coffee tray . " Exactly like yours , " said Rob , " when it touches your children . " " Thank you . Stuffy , conventional , prejudiced , and ignorant . " She got up , turned her back on him and went
