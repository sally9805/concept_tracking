 | A BULLET IN THE ROCKIES Alpine ski racing is the sport in which an athlete hopes to streak down from the top of a mountain to the bottom of a cup of hot chocolate faster than a speeding bullet ? and never mind if he risks cracking his skull against a tree trunk on the way . It has nothing to do with pleasure skiing . There are no pauses for yodeling , lighting up a filter tip or conning the best dished-up bunny on the snow into thinking the old leg wo n't take it today . Ski racing is a dangerous , instinctive plunge , requiring nerve , concentration and stamina . It is also a sport in which the U.S. , despite a fierce dedication to the goal , has yet to outbrave or outstreak the powerful Austrians and French . Those Europeans , seemingly , soon after birth develop legs with sevenfoot-long slats attached in place of feet . The U.S. trailed them in third place at the 1962 World Championships in Chamonix and last year in the Innsbruck Olympics . Next week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. confronts the Austrians and French on home snow , and this time the carving skis of Billy Kidd ( see cover ) , possibly our finest racer ever , might just might ? put America over 26  | the top . The Vail events begin the biggest and most exciting invasion of American slopes by Alpine experts since handsome Austrian instructors discovered that well-heeled American bunnies were in need of handsome Austrian instruction . This happens to be an off year in international ski racing , with the next world championships not scheduled until the summer of 1966 at Portillo , Chile and the Winter Olympics in Grenoble three long winters away . Even so , the Swiss and Canadians are so provoked at not being asked to Vail that they are invading a few days later for the best of the remaining U.S. meets , including the Harriman Cup at Sun Valley and the National Championships at Crystal Mountain , Wash . Besides the Americans , they will find the French and Austrians at Sun Valley and the Austrians staying on for the Nationals . The man responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team , blustery , fast-moving , scheming , dedicated Bob Beattie ( rhymes with skibatty ) , the self-appointed savior of U.S. Alpine hopes and dreams . For years America lived in the apresski world of cocktail parties and individual training , and had trouble understanding why the Europeans raced better . Then along came Beattie , who is the University of Colorado ski coach in his spare time , with a simple and unsettling message . " We got to get off our butts and ski faster , " growled Beattie . Since 1961 his training methods , which have called for unprecedented physical and mental exertion on the part of his racers , have drawn criticism from such skiing personalities as Denver University Coach Willy Schaeffler , Beattie 's main collegiate rival ; Olympic gold medalist Andrea Mead Lawrence ; and friends of Mammoth Mountain 's Coach Dave McCoy , whose easygoing nature is preferred by the girl racers . But while his critics have nattered , Beattie has worked . " You ca n't take college kids from the framework of our society and beat the Europeans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless you work and get tough , " he says . " You ca n't go from a cocktail party to a slalom and beat Karl Schranz. " @# @# Last year Beattie , despite his pro ices of a breakthrough , almost snow plowed into obscurity before the 1 men 's race of the Olympics . But on t cold day outside Innsbruck , with the sands lining the slalom course , Bil Kidd and Jimmy Heuga , two quiet , termined , 20-year-old Beattie loyalists won silver and bronze medals . These , followers of skiing will recall , were t first men 's Olympic medals ever taken by Americans . Then one week later Garmisch at the Arlberg Kandahar , t Masters Tournament of skiing , Jim Heuga won the slalom and , another fi for the U.S. , the combined . Bob Beattie 's reaction to this last-ho success was predictable . He did not f rescued or pardoned from the wrath his critics . He simply released a Litt more energy . " We finally lit the fires . he said , sounding a bit like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's critics did him no real harm , for he was reappointed as national coach last June . The only point on which they were close to the target was that he showed harshness and impatience in handling the girl racers . Even so , Jean Saubert came very close to getting two golds at Innsbruck , and lost out only because those rowdy French girls , Marielle and Christine Goitschel , came up with superperformances . Indeed , the thing the ruling powers of the U.S. Ski Association realized , even if some of the critics did not , was that Beattie had given American racers a spirit and program they had never had . He still works 24 hours a day , arranging , persuading , cajoling , coaching , phoning , figuring , worrying , to sustain it . What Beattie has given to U.S. ski racing was expressed recently by JeanClaude Killy , France 's newest star and the best skier in Europe today . Killy , a soulful , lean , blue-eyed citizen of Vald'Isere ( his father 's hotel and sports shop is a quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend of Jimmy Heuga who attended Beattie 's early training camp at Bend , Ore . in August . " The Americans have a spirit that has made me better understand the sport , " Killy says . " They are passionate , and they have fun . Their way represents the ideal to me . And they are now formidable racers . " Beattie is a man of formidable impulses , a doer . He no sooner envisioned the three-way American International  | meet , as the Vail races are called , than he went straight to ABC-TV and sold it the network 's Wide World of Sports . Teleision money will pay for bringing Austrians and French to the U.S. Before this " off year " is over , six American - races will have been televised , thanks Beattie 's hard sell . Beattie 's coaching and private lives have long since fused into one ? one big blur of motion , unrest , gruffness , extreme pleasure and perpetual crisis . Beatie seems to believe that whatever he does a mere step toward a loftier goal that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , he was walking one day along Broadway , the campus drag in Boulder , when he saw a vacant building . He leased it with no money , called his brother Jack in Laconia , N.H. and . " We 're partners in a ski shop , come on out . " Jack came , and the Alpine Haus is now a successful business . Bob Beattie rarely sees it . On a similar impulse he bought four lots after a Sunday drive through Pine Brook Hills , a lovely ridge on a front range of the Rockies overlooking Boulder . He still has three , and on one he has built It a $27,000 home for himself , his wife Ann and his children , Suzy , 7 , and Bobby , 5 . It is a handsome design of glass , beams , rock , raw lumber and mortgages . Not long ago a man told Beattie he could have his own personal label on wine bottle . Beattie bought 24 cases . All of these acts , and numerous lesser ones , prompted Ann to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our cup runneth over . " Since Beattie 's life is dominated by his intense desire to beat the Europeans , , y his preoccupation with ski racing ? . worldwide , nationwide and Boulderwide ? everything else suffers . It is nothing for Beattie 's skiers , friends or family To be swooped up and driven at Grand ? rix speeds to a mountain and then be totally ignored for hours or even days . He has moved from one place to another so quickly that after a furious two w eeks his boots have been returned to aim from Aspen , his parka from Vail , his skis from Eldora , his Suzy from Crested Butte and his Bobby from Steamboat Springs . Chief retriever , keeper , understander , consoler , ego builder , chef , wine steward , cleaning lady , psychiatrist and Bookkeeper is , of course , Ann ( " one of the great women of our time , " says Beattie ) . @#  | It was Beattie who taught Ann to ski . He commenced by taking her to the top of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Beattie left . Ann went straight down ? and broke her leg . Nowadays she skis more cautiously but goes flatout in everything else . She teaches a full load of Spanish at Boulder 's Douglass Junior High School , shovels snow , fixes flats , repairs electrical and plumbing fixtures and laughs a lot . She is den mother to America 's best skiers as well . She can not remember a time when only Beatties lived in the house . Currently , Jimmy Heuga and Spider Sabich are sleeping on rollaways in the den , with Heuga 's Irish setter , Shamus , lavishing affection on both . Last spring Ni Orsi was the guest . This spring Billy Kidd will probably move in , and maybe Billy Marolt . With the exceptions of Middlebury Downhiller Gordy Eaton and Denver 's slalom specialist Rick Chaffee , all of the top U.S. racers are students at the University of Colorado . Well , Orsi was . A flashy but likable Californian ? " the Joe Don Looney of skiing , " jokes a friend ? Orsi has withdrawn for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of acting , surf-@# 30 ing , golf , flying , sports car racing , art , cooking or water skiing , at all of which he seems to be adept . Still on the national team , Orsi plans to return to Colorado one day . He happens to be America 's best downhill racer . Kidd and Heuga are the slalom and giant-slalom aces . Marolt and Sabich are fast improving in all three events . Spending an evening in the Beattie household , or dormitory , is like being trapped on a frantic movie set . The scene is something like this : Ann Beattie is watching 10 pounds of steak with one eye , preparing a dinner for 13 , and translating the ski news from the French sports daily L'Equipe with the other . Heuga is wrestling with Shamus . Marolt is wrestling with the children . Kidd is reading on the divan . Heuga 's girl friend , a cute blonde named Bonnie Ogilvie , is mixing the salad . Beattie , through a spray of cigar smoke , is bellowing into the telephone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If Orsi were around , he most likely would be practicing his fast-draw technique , which he hopes will land him a part in a western movie . No one present will soon forget the spectacle of Orsi arriving at Beattie 's for a date with one of the overnight boarders . He wore a white lapelless jacket , cowboy boots , sideburns , Beatle trousers and a sixshooter laced to his gun leg . Not all of Beattie 's racers are as far out as Orsi , but they are all individualists . Heuga is the coolest dancer west of Trude Heller 's in Greenwich Village , having invented the frug before anyone knew how to pronounce discotheque . Billy Kidd is an accomplished amateur photographer and an unusually conscientious student . Spider Sabich , whose name is a vivid reminder of the fact that American racers have names like movie stars ?

Marolt is the nearest thing to an average American youth ? and he is the lad who borrowed a bus in Innsbruck , creating an international incident . They are a - devoted group , devoted not only to Beattie but to each other and the goal of outskiing the Europeans by 1966 , 1968 or , when they dream a little , next week . Always close , Beattie @# and the boys were brought even closer together last April when Buddy Werner their pioneering leader , perished in avalanche at St. Moritz .

Beattie 's skiers are nu : this season in black armbands ; the races have been dedicated to Wern memory . When Buddy died and the only of U.S. veteran , Chuck Ferries , retired from racing to sell skis and coach girls ? a job Beattie enjoys describing as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team leader . There is now . his own curious way it is Billy Ki Kidd is a polite , rather wide-eyed you man from Stowe , Vt . He leads by ample ? the example of being a prideful resolute competitor and , if this seas is proof enough , a racer of truly i mense talent . A year ago Kidd gave an indicant. that he might be exactly that . A tireless worker who has a strange ability t practice slowly under total control most racers practice at top speed ? 1 not only finished second in the Olympic slalom , he was , in unofficial calculations , the third-best combined racer Innsbruck or , if you prefer , in the world .. He has done nothing but improve . In January , he swept the Roch Cup events at Aspen , something no one except Buddy Werner had done before . He became the first to win the Roch two consecutive years . In one spurt Kidd won eight straight races , which no one had ever done in major competitions in the U.S. He has actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's really something , " says the soft-voiced Heuga . " He 's got great confidence . He 's so controlled . Gee , you just ca n't see a mistake anywhere . " Says Marolt , " I 'm racing better than I 've ever raced in my life , but Billy man , he 's incredible . " Kidd himself is not that impressed . " Fm skiing well , " he admits , " but it 's just maturity , experience and Bob 's program paying off . We 're all a little better . Marolt is this close to beating me right now . Jimmy 's starting to cut loose . " " Kidd wants our other guys to beat him if they ski fantastic , " says Beattie . " But he does n't want anyone else to beat him . Naw , that 's not right . Kidd  | does n't want anyone to beat him ? ever . " The most fascinating question posed by the Vail meet is : Just how good is Kidd ? No one can be sure : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season . Clearly he will have to ski well indeed to surpass the top invaders . Take Jeann-Claude Killy . Voted the best all-round skier of the year by European reporters , Killy has been nearly as hot as Kidd and against far stiffer competition . He has won three major races , including - the Hahnenkamm slalom , and he hass had four seconds . The French men 's team will also include the reliable Guy Perillat , who won the Lauberhorn slalom , Leo Lacroix , Michel Arpin , Pierre Stamos and Jules Melquiond . The six-man Austrian team will be led by Karl Schranz who , despite his nine hard years of racing , has had a spectacular 1965 season in downhills with a victory in the Arlberg Kandahar and five finishes in the top three . Olympic Downhill Champion Egon Zimmermann was injured in a car accident and is unlikely to be fit in time for Vail . The other five Austrians are Hugo Nindl , Gerhard Nenning , Heini Mess-@# @# ner , Franz Digruber and Stefan Sodat . Team points in the American Internationals will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places in each of the three events . First comes the downhill on Saturday , a two-mile run featuring unusual , plateaued runouts and one crucial turn before the final schuss , the slalom on Sunday and the giant slalom on Monday . The format was devised by Beattie , and he carefully arranged for two team trophies to be awarded , one for the men and a separate one for women . There was a reason . The American girls will be woeful underdogs to the French , who have those Goitschels plus Annie Famose and Christine Terraillon , and to Austria 's Traudl Hecher , Christl Haas , Edith Zimmermann and Grete Digruber . Jean Saubert is not in top condition , planning , as she is , to retire before the FIS meet in Chile . Linda Meyers , Joan Hannah and Sandy Shellworth will likely complete the Vail team . Shellworth is a tall , strong girl who could emerge as our next Saubert if she begins to race consistently . There are others with potential ? Suzy Chaffee , Cathy Nagel and Wendy and Cathy Allen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 men and 10 women , will race at Vail to fill out an attractive program , but only the top six men and four girls will be in point-counting competition with the Europeans . " Our girls could surprise me , " says Beattie , mixing hope and cynicism . " They 've never done anything but surprise me , one way or another . " Beattie decided last season , even before the Olympics , that the girls should have their own coach in the future . Beattie chose Ferries ? a man he can work with . The men 's team is something else . His own personal property , in fact . " They 're great , " Beattie says . " You know why they 're great ? Because they 're college kids who can ski like hell . Anybody would want Kidd , Heuga or Marolt for a son . Marolt is thinking about becoming a dentist . If he 'll do that , I 'll put him in business . Something like that would be a greater satisfaction for me than anything . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Beattie , smiling . " There 's something to that . "
