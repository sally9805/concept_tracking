A Jules Feiffer cartoon is an act of aggression camouflaged by humor . Feiffer is a satirical sniper who drills lethal little holes in the feverish body politic . In security , hostility , urban hysteria are both his targets and his weapons , and all his cartoons are Little Murders , as he has titled his first full-length play . <P> When the play was first presented on Broadway in 1967 , it was given an inept production that erred fatally by trying to be realistic . Caricatures can not be played as people , and the jokes seemed to expire rather than explode . <P> The current off-Broadway production is breath-catchingly funny , surrealistic in tone and style and hair-trigger fast in pace . All this it owes to Director Alan Arkin . He shows such ready mas tery of comic tempo and zany action that Mike Nichols and Gene Saks might as well know that they have a competitor on their hands . <P> The central problem of Little Murders has not been , and probably can not be , resolved . It is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an organic drama . The characters do not develop ; they reiterate attitudes . One is aware of a point of view , but not of a range of life . The setting is Manhattan 's Upper West Side , the people a middle-class family . From the beginning , much of the humor revolves around an inversion of sexual roles . The men , father , son and photographer-fianc , are towers of Jello . The women , wife and daughter , are ice picks . They live in what is almost a psychotic New York milieu of impending violence and the rape of privacy . There are three locks and a burglar alarm on the front door . There is also " The Breather , " a telephonic intruder , who calls at odd , menacing hours to breathe and snort . At comic and not-so-comic war with itself , the family listens to sporadic rifle fire in the streets that betokens a city at war with itself . <P> Verbal Combat Fatigue . The plot , insofar as there is one , is to get the fiance ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpetuity , to marry the daughter and then do something or other with his life . As a photographer he has specialized in pictures of human excrement , which is presumably Feiffer 's ultimate comment on the state of contemporary society . But the fiance is catatonically passive . At one point his would-be bride ( Linda Lavin ) says with caustic distress : " See , he does n't know how to fight . That 's why I 'm not winning . " Finally , the pair gets married out of something resembling verbal combat fatigue , and the bride is arbitrarily killed by a stray bullet shortly after . At play 's end , the family is in a state of siege , with guns at the ready . <P> Feiffer obviously intended to produce the blackest of comedies , but the laughs are treacherously lighthearted . What he does achieve , with the aid of a remarkably resourceful cast , is social observation that is as sharp as a shark 's bite , and a highly contemporaneous sense of the unsettling transvaluation of all values .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
