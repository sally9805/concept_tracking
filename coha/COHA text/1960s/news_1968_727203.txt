He , like Judge Thornberry , is an old arid close personal friend of Mr. Johnson 's . Opposition to both nominations was immediate .

" The Senate majority leader , Mike Mansfield , said he hoped the nominations would ' be approved by the Senate . The nominations combined two characteristics of many ' during Mr. Johnson's.Presidency //  --  a tendency to make appointments that are historic firsts and one to place close personal associates in high office . Before this ' morning 's news conference , President Johnson had not commented on the widespread reports that Chief Justice Warren had submitted his resignation . Solely Because , of Age ' The President read the Chief Justice 's letter , which he said he received June 13 . The letter explained that the 77-year-old Justice planned ' to retire " solely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of the fifteen years I have been here , " Chief Justice Warren wrote . But he noted that when he entered public life more than a half-century ago , 150 million of the 200 million living Ameri cans had not yet been born . He said a younger man , should now take over . President Johnson released a letter from him to the Chief Justice , in which he praised the " exceptional distinction " of Mr. Warren 's service . Mr. Johnson said he would accept the resignation , effective when the new Chief Justice was sworn in . Justice Fortas , who was 58 years old on June 19 , has been a close friend of Mr. Johnson for three decades . He has served as Mr. Johnson 's personal lawyer and has advised the President on a wide range of affairs , both before and after Mr. Fortas became a justice . In the three years since Mr. Johnson appointed him to the Court , Justice Fortas has frequently lined up with Chief Justice Warren and other liberal justices .

Nixon might be elected President and that he wished to step down now so that Mr. Johnson could appoint a liberal to take his place .

Prior to his first judgeship , Mr. Thornberry served for 15 years in the Congressional seat that Mr. Johnson vacated when he was elected to the Senate in 1948 . President Johnson appointed him to the Federal District Court for the Western District of Texas in December , 1963 , and elevated him to the Court of Appeals in July , 1965 . On the fifth circuit , Judge Thornberry has generally voted on desegregation issues with the majority , which has the most liberal record on racial questions of any appeals court .

Although Justice Fortas is already a member of the Supreme Court , the office of Chief Justice is a distinct office , mentioned separately in the Constitution , and he must be confirmed again . He presumably will retain his post as Associate Justice until the Senate acts . As Chief Justice he would receive an annual salary of $40,000 ,  --  a $500 raise from his present compensation ? and would be given the use of the Supreme Court 's only chauffered limousine . Despite these prerequisites , the Chief Justice exercises the same vote as the other Justices and is said to be " first among equals .

Parker in 1930 , has failed to be confirmed . Albert E. Jenner of Chicago , chairman of the American Bar Association Committee on the Federal Judiciary , said that the 12-member panel had conferred on a conference telephone call early this morning and unanimously found both men qualified . The Government traditionally asks the bar committee to rate prospective judicial nominees for the lower Federal judiciary , and avoids appointing persons who are deemed unqualified . The hurried polling of the committee on Supreme Court appointments has also become a recent tradition but is considered no more than a formality . ? Chief Justice Warren was in San Francisco today . In a statement issued through his office here , he praised Justice Fortas as a scholar , an administrator and " a great lawyer , and I know he will be a great Chief Justice . " He also commended Judge Thornberry for his record in Congress and on the bench .
