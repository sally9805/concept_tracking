To many a Congressman , massive defense spending is essential to the nation 's prosperity . Not so , says a top-level presidential committee that has spent 18 months studying the economic impact of the defense program . The committee 's first report , issued last week , concludes : " Even general and complete disarmament would pose no insuperable problems ; instead , it would mainly afford opportunities for a better life for our citizens . " <P> <P> Even partial disarmament is a remote prospect . However , thanks to advances in weaponry and more efficient management , defense spending , which in the past decade provided the wages for one in every twelve workers , leveled off last year and thus actually declined in relation to the nation 's rising G.N.P . The economy is sufficiently resilient to cope with much sharper cuts in the military budget , by increased federal spending for civilian purposes , by tax reductions or , most likely , by a combination of both . <P> The committee , headed by Gardner Ackley , who is also Chairman of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation 's G.N.P . will rise from the 1964 level of $629 billion to $870 billion by 1970 . Thus , at current tax rates the government will have an extra $50 billion in annual revenue by 1970 , even if military spending remains constant . This is the committee 's " conservative " estimate . These funds , it recommended , should be pumped back into the economy to prevent recession . Hence the " better life . " <P> The committee acknowledged that " fiscal policies alone can not prevent problems of local distress and disruption " that accompany shifts in arms spending . Changes in strategic planning , notably the switch from bombers to missiles , have already seriously hurt many industries and localities . Aircraft companies alone abolished nearly 50,000 jobs between 1962 and 1964 , largely as a result of declining military demand . In small communities such as Port Clinton , Ohio ( pop . 7,000 ) , which stands to lose 2,000 jobs when the Erie Army Depot closes next year , such shifts can be ruinous . The committee therefore urged continued research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology . This , rather than any likelihood of widespread unemployment as a result of disarmament , is the Administration 's principal cutback worry .
