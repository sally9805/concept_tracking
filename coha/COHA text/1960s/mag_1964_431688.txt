 | Justice With a Southern Accent Do our federal courts need emancipating ? @# An effective judiciary establishment , commensurate to the legislative authority , is essential . A government without a proper executive and judiciary would be the mere trunk of a body , without arms or legs to act or move . ? James Madison , at the Federal Convention June 5 , 1787 The United States Supreme Court , speaking with rare unanimity , has declared time and again that the Fourteenth Amendment imposes upon the states a comprehensive requirement of impartiality between the races . It has applied this principle in one context after another ? public education , the franchise , travel by common carrier , municipal recreation facilities , privately owned places of public accommodation , and on and on . Yet , in the deep South , acceptance of the principle is still the exception . The most powerful government in the world seems powerless to enforce its laws against local resistance . The late Earl Long once observed to Leander Perez , the king of Louisiana 's Plaquemines Parish : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The Feds have got the A-bomb . " Governors Faubus , Barnett , and Wallace have learned that open efforts at nullification are no more effective now than when John C. Calhoun first proposed them . Naked defiance of the federal law , as at Little Rock , Oxford , and Tuscaloosa , is doomed by its candor . When the prestige and authority of the federal government are overtly challenged , there can be no compromise . But cleverer men , more interested in results than in cheap drama , have devised other defensive weapons , quieter but far more effective . Skilled legal tacticians , they know the weak points of the federal judicial system and how to take advantage of them . Their rearguard legal operations have been successful enough to cause grave concern . By hamstringing the federal mechanism for peaceable resolution of divisive issues , they have invited civil disorder and directly jeopardized the openness of our society . Local prejudices have too often been allowed to prevail over the mandates of the U. S. Supreme Court . And in too many cases , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negro father whose ten-year-old son attends the same Mississippi school that he attended , and his own father before him . The year his son was born the Supreme Court unanimously declared public-school segregation unconstitutional . Yet not a single grade school or high school in Mississippi has been integrated .  | From all appearances the child ? and even the child 's children ? will go through segregated schools . Or the Negro child in Prince Edward County , Virginia . For his parents ' boldness in demanding his rights , his education was completely interrupted for four years . Last summer a private school supported by charity was established . It will enable the child to resume his education in a segregated school while the courts ponder abstruse problems of federal-state relationships . Or the NAACP in the state of Alabama , where that organization has been prevented from operating for the past seven years . The end of the resulting federal litigation is not even in sight . Or the Negro who , ninety-four years after the adoption of the Fifteenth Amendment , wants to vote . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be denied on racial grounds . In 1957 Congress empowered the Justice Department to intervene directly in voting cases . But in 1960 professors at Tuskegee Institute in Alabama , despite their Ph.D.s , were able to register ? if at all ? only after exhausting investigations of their literacy by voting registrars who , to put it rather mildly , do not have graduate degrees . Any person who offers to instruct a Negro in the intricacies of application forms and state constitutions must also accept certain risks . He must remember the pistol-whipping administered one John Hardy two years ago by the voting registrar in the sheriff 's office in Tylertown , Mississippi , and the tear-gas attack on the registration school in the Hopewell Baptist Church last year . Nor will he forget the murder of Medgar W. Evers , whose offense was that he served an organization dedicated to firm pursuit of Negro voting rights through orderly legal channels . Figures are hardly adequate to describe this breakdown in federal law . But by the end of 1962 , the 1954 Supreme Court decision had brought four-tenths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven Southern states into schools attended by whites . The most recent re-@# port of the Civil Rights Commission showed that 32 per cent of all Negroes of voting age in tea of those states were registered , compared with 65 per cent of the whites . ( This excluded Mississippi , where figures were not available . ) Rigid Mandates to Act Our Constitution allocates to the federal courts the primary responsibility for enforcing federal law over local resistance . The need for this enforcement , in fact , was the only reason the Constitutional Convention of 1787 provided for the lower federal courts ? the eighty-nine district courts , which are trial courts , and the eleven regional courts of appeals , which can review their decisions in most , but not all , cases . The Convention readily saw the need for a supreme court to serve as final arbiter of the federal law . Two of the South Carolina delegates , however , argued that a supreme court was enough . They favored a system under which the state judges would be obligated to uphold federal law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was James Madison who argued ? properly so ? that the federal trial courts were indispensable for the effective enforcement of locally unpopular federal law ; the Convention yielded to his logic . The secret of the present Southern resistance lies in canny exploitation of weaknesses in the federal judiciary as it is now organized and manned . The U. S. Supreme Court is simply too busy to decide each of the myriad cases arising from local disobedience . It must concentrate upon a relatively few key rulings in which controlling principles can be enunciated , and rely on the lower courts to implement those principles . The federal district courts are manned by judges drawn from their localities , a necessity since much of the law they apply is the law of the state where they sit . Being human , these district judges have not remained unaffected by the entrenched social patterns of their communities , of their friends and former colleagues at the bar . These pressures do not affect the federal court of appeals judges in quite the same way . They serve multistate regions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community which is involved , for example , in jury trials . Ordinarily they act in panels of three or more rather than individually . " What the district judges need ? and what most of them want , " political scientist J. W. Peltason has written , " is not the responsibility  | for making choices , but rigid mandates that compel them to act . " It is therefore the federal courts of appeals ? particularly those for the Fourth and Fifth Judicial Circuits , sitting at Richmond and New Orleans and serving all the states of the old Confederacy except Tennessee and Arkansas ? which can best take the laboring oar in implementing the principle of racial equality . They have performed gallantly . But there are limitations upon the scope of their operations . Unless they are emancipated from these limitations , the constitutional promise will continue to be flagrantly broken . What the President Can Do The most crippling limitation lies in the unwillingness of many federal district judges to avail themselves of the services of the federal courts of appeals in the assumption of unpleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid breaking new ground by refusing to apply the equal-protection principle to situations not previously decided in the courts . It is quite another matter , and a more dangerous one , for him to use his office as a fortress of resistance to the mandates of the Constitution as interpreted by the higher courts . The President of the United States has the power ? and the obligation ? to appoint judges who , however opposed they may be to integration , however reluctant to go against local mores , will acquiesce in the discipline of the law . There have been some outstanding federal district judges in the South . Judge J. Waties Waring , a native South Carolinian appointed to the district bench at Charleston in 1942 , made clear his intention to enforce the law as he understood it . He did not shrink from admonishing Democratic party officials , in a voting case , to follow " the American way of elections . " He dissented from a three-judge district-court ruling which upheld segregation . He became the target of intense abuse , his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1952 and moved to New York , where he still lives as a reminder of judicial integrity . Despite their admittedly exposed position , other Southern district judges too have set high standards . I cite only a few . Judge Frank M. Johnson of Montgomery saw to it in 1959 that the Civil Rights Commission gained access to voting records which his friend and former classmate , Alabama Judge ( now Governor ) George C. Wallace , had taken into his personal custody . Judge William Augustus Bootle of Georgia enjoined the diehard voting registrars of Terrell County in 1959 from discriminating against Negroes . Judges J. Skelly Wright and Herbert Christenberry of Louisiana have stood firm for school integration in New Orleans . Last November , Judge Lewis R. Morgan of Georgia joined with Circuit Judge Elbert P. Tuttle in a two-toone decision enjoining the prosecution of Negro sympathizers on preposterous capital charges under the Georgia insurrection statute , which the Supreme Court had held unconstitutional in 1937 . The federal district judge can do his job , and do it well , only so long as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man is happy or sad to get a case , then he should n't get it . " For unless a judge regards himself as a servant of the law 's objectives rather than his own , he does not belong on the bench . It is absolutely crucial that a President limit his judicial appointments to men who satisfy this minimum test . There are political difficulties , but they must not be allowed to stand in the way . The anachronistic custom of " Senatorial courtesy " and the seniority rule for committee chairmen , which accords strategic Congressional positions to veteran legislators from one-party Southern states , has made the task especially hard for a Democratic President . Appointment of a Mississippi federal judge , for example , who is personally unacceptable to Senator James Eastland would not only face a rough time in Eastland 's powerful Judiciary Committee , but would encounter opposition on the Senate floor itself , where all judicial appointments must be approved . It is odd but true that Republican federal judges in the South have generally been more progressive and responsible than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If political pressures prevent him from appointing avowed integrationists , he must surely refrain from choosing men who have made known their distaste for the job the federal courts are supposed to perform . Yet such men were even among the appointees of President Kennedy , who worked more effectively for racial justice than any other recent President ; and their performance on the district bench has caused profound resentment among civil-rights groups . Judge William Harold Cox of Mississippi is an old friend and former law partner of Eastland . Judge J. Robert Elliott of Georgia once explained why he favored rural domination of Georgia politics : " I do n't want these pinks , radicals , and  | black voters to outvote those who are trying to preserve our segregation laws and traditions . " Judge E. Gordon West of Louisiana called the 1954 school ruling " one of the truly regrettable decisions of all time . " Judge Frank B. Ellis of Louisiana helped uphold the legality , in 1962 , of a state law requiring that the race of all candidates for office be printed on ballots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , went so far as to forbid integration in a school which was ready to admit Negroes , saying that the rights of white children would be violated . ( His decision was quickly reversed by the court of appeals . ) The role of the federal district judge is important because of his vast discretionary authority . Within very broad limits he has the power to decide whether quick provisional relief will be granted , by temporary restraining order or by preliminary injunction . He has the power to expedite or delay a trial . He has the power to decide what evidence goes into the record . He can decide a case quickly , or hold it for months or years . Even the court stenographer , who must transcribe court notes before an appeal can be heard , is subject to his orders on priority of work . A judge who is willing to abuse his discretionary powers can stultify the law . It is an absolute necessity for President Johnson to appoint district judges who , however they may decide cases , will decide them quickly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the higher courts have spoken , enforce their mandates ungrudgingly . What the Supreme Court Can Do I n declaring the meaning of our basic law in terms consistent with the needs , desires , and aspirations of the people as a whole , the Supreme Court has performed its primary role magnificently . But it has another responsibility : to administer the federal judicial system in a way that will obtain from the lower courts the full measure of effective law enforcement . The Supreme Court 's performance here leaves something to be desired . Its most notable error was the " deliberate speed " formula , laid down in 1955 . The Court had decided the year before , in Brown v. Board of Education and a group of similar cases , that public-school segregation is a denial of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment . Ordinarily the winning party in a lawsuit gets at least part of what he su for ; if he sues for breach of a contract to b a house and wins , for instance , the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the successful plaintiffs in the school c did not get an order directing their admissi to school . What they got was a promise that . some time in the indefinite future ( perhaps aft they themselves had finished school ) , some of Negroes would be given the rights which t Court said those plaintiffs had . Coupled with this promise was an admonition to the local sch boards to accomplish integration " with all deli erate speed , " and a direction to the federal d ' trict courts to ride herd on them . The effect w to shift the responsibility for judicial initiati in cases demanding drastic change of sett local customs , to the very sector of the fede judiciary least fit to assume it . It is time to write off the " deliberate speed ' formula as a sad mistake ; the Supreme Court . in the spring of 1963 , gave some basis for hope that this might be done ? serving notice that the conditions which originally led to the adoption of the formula no longer prevail . But this in itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district courts for relief from the primary burden of changing local mores must be recognized as a general tenet of judicial administration . A lesson bought so dearly must not be forgotten . The Supreme Court has further invited evasion of judicial responsibility by the district courts by developing the novel and curious doctrine known as " abstention . " Until 1941 , the Court had proceeded on the premise that federal courts are obligated to decide cases within their jurisdiction , even though this involved judging doubtful questions of state law . There had been no departure from the emphatic affirmation of Chief Justice Marshall in 1821 : " With whatever doubts , with whatever difficulties , a case may be attended , we must decide it , if it be brought before us . We have no more right to decline the exercise of jurisdiction which is given , than to usurp that which is not given . The one or the other would be treason to the Constitution . " But in the 1941 Pullman case , a very involved Texas public-utility case , the U. S. Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstain temporarily from exercising jurisdiction ? which it admittedly had ? until the parties in the case had obtained a ruling from the Texas Supreme Court , that is , from a state court . Justice Felix Frankfurter , speaking for the U. S. Supreme Court , tried to make it  | clear that this abstention on the part of the federal court would be appropriate only in exceedingly rare cases . But the Pandora 's Box had been opened . In recent years , despite the efforts of the Supreme Court and the federal courts of appeals ' . o confine the doctrine of abstention to narrow bounds , it has been a continuing temptation to the district courts and has been used widely in racial cases . Nearly all these cases have required interpretation of state laws of one kind or another by state courts ? segregation laws , trespass ordinances , breach-of-peace statutes ? and not a few district judges have learned the siren song : " Do n't assume that the state law means what it seems to say ; the state court may construe ' it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involves a delay of some years , and that justice delayed may be justice denied , tends to be forgotten in the amiable glow of judicious respect for sister courts , and relief at deferment of a distasteful duty . Again there is need for Supreme Court action . The abstention doctrine , if retained at all , should be so explicitly circumscribed that no federal district judge can honorably employ it as a device for avoiding locally unpopular decisions . And , again , there is a broader lesson to be learned : the federal district judges should be left with no subtle routes of escape from the unpleasant but essential task that Madison and the Convention envisioned for them . @# What Congress Can Do The creation of new legal rights against racial discrimination is needed in a number of fields : ? mployment , housing , public accommodation , federally aided activities of all kinds . A still more urgent need , however , is for effective enforcement of rights which the Supreme Court has already declared to exist . The pending civilrights bill proposes several sound provisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area ? e increased assumption of litigation by the Justice Department ? it puts more teeth into established rights . President Johnson , whose quick reaffirmation of his predecessor 's civilrights program is the more heartening because he is a Southerner , can ? without disparagement of that program ? broaden it to include at least four other vitally needed reforms. * ' For a more detailed discussion , see my article in the Columbia Law Review , November 1963. ( 1 ) The traditional reluctance of the federal courts to interfere with state judicial proceedings , which is based on a vague federal law on the books in one form or another since 1793 , should be severely qualified if not altogether abandoned . The federal statute derives from the theory , which used to be reasonably safe , that however lawless the political officials of the states may be , the state judges will not engage in wholesale defiance of the U. S. Constitution which they have been sworn to uphold . Elective state judges all over the South have bowed to the general hatred of federal law on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignore it . It is a politically profitable position . It won the Alabama governorship for Judge George C. Wallace , and brought promotion from the circuit court to the Mississippi Supreme Court for Tom P. Brady , who had written in his book , Black Monday : " The Negroid man , like the modern lizard , evolved not . He did not evolve because of his inherent limitations . " Under such circumstances the presumption of legality which has surrounded Southern state court decisions has become a fiction on racial questions . Congress must affirm the power and duty of the federal courts to prohibit by injunction any state action which frustrates the enjoyment of federal rights , and to jail any state official ? even a judge ? if he persists in violating the injunction . Many lawyers think this is already the law . But in 1962 , in the Mississippi Freedom Rider cases , the Supreme Court declined an opportunity to decide the question , and it may not do so for years . Confirmation by Congress of this crucial in- junction power would provide a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in state courts without any evidence of wrongdoing whatever . The Freedom Rider prosecutions in Jackson in 1961 , where 315 people were convicted of breach of the peace solely because they had used the " wrong " waiting rooms in interstate terminals ? which they had every right to do ? provide a perfect example of this situation . ( 2 ) Often it can be shown that Negroes are unable to get a fair and impartial trial in state courts . In such cases the remedy should be removal from the state to the federal courts for trial . Congress included this provision in civilrights legislation soon after the Civil War , and it is still formally on the books . But in 1879 the Supreme Court , evidently unwilling to believe that federal rights would systematically be denied in state courts , gave the statute a restrictive interpretation which has deprived it of most of its force . This removal statute should be restored to full vigor without delay . ( 3 ) The process of appeals to higher courts also needs to be changed . On its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal district judge refuses to accept jurisdiction of a case removed from a state court , his refusal ? which is in legal terms called a " remand order " ? can not be appealed . This means that even if the right to removal were clearly established , it might be frustrated by a weak district judge . The federal court of appeals ? which stands between the district court and the Supreme Court ? would be powerless to accept responsibility for the removal of a case . An important case now pending in the courts argues , on the basis of a careful analysis of the legislative history , that the relevant statute does not apply in civil-rights cases . But Congress should not wait . ( 4 ) In most cases appeals from the federal district courts go to the federal courts of appeals . There is one crucial area of litigation , however , in which the appeal is directly to the U. S. Supreme Court . If a party seeks to enjoin ? to stop the enforcement of ? a state statute or local ordinance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case is heard not by the usual one-judge district court , but by a specially convened district court composed of three judges . Appeals from the decisions of such courts must go directly to the Supreme Court . Hence a frightfully busy Supreme Court is deprived of the aid of the federal courts of appeals . In other cases these intermediate appeals courts perform the important function of keeping the district courts in line with principles announced by the Supreme Court , so that t Supreme Court need not take the time necessary for full review when no unsettled point of la is involved . But a direct appeal from an erroneous decision places the Supreme Court in a genui dilemma . Either it takes the case , at the cost time needed for creative decisions on other appea or it declines jurisdiction and leaves the district courts , the most conservative sector of the fede judiciary , with full responsibility . Appellate review is obviously needed to keep the difficulty of the district judge 's task within tolerable limits . But the direct-appeal procedure puts the Supreme Court under great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure to which it has sometimes succumbed . Congress should alter this process . Appeals from the decisions of all district courts , including three-judge courts , should be sent to the intermediate federal courts of appeals . The Real Meaning A bstract as some of these reforms may seem to the non-lawyer , let there be no mistaking their profound impact on racial matters in the South . The Mississippi Freedom Rider cases , which made yesterday 's headlines , have given rise to a complex series of obstructionist legal maneuvers reaching from a municipal court through the lower federal courts to the U. S. Supreme Court and back again . They offer a good illustration of the real meaning of the abstention doctrine . the reluctance of federal district judges to interfere with state court proceedings , the doubts about the right of removing a trial to a federal court , the apparent unappealability of remand orders , and the general conservatism of Southern district judges . These cases , which I know well at first hand . went to the courts in May 1961 . They show defiance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by naked power . All the Freedom Riders did was enter the white waiting rooms at the interstate terminals in Jackson , Mississippi . They were not armed . or profane , or loud , or threatening ; they were testing , in an orderly way , their rights . The federal right at issue was the right to travel unsegregated on common carriers , a relatively peripheral right when compared with education . or employment , or the franchise . The U. S. Supreme Court had held in a line of cases going back to 1946 that no state could require or permit segregation of interstate or intrastate transpor- tation by railroad , bus , or airline . In 1960 it had specifically held that this principle applies to the terminal facilities as well . If the federal law , which clearly precludes the remotest possibility of successful prosecution under local segregation statutes , could be frustrated in these circumstances , it could be frustrated in just about every case conceivable . Frustrated it was . In a campaign of attrition a criminal conviction is a valuable thing , simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . The local authorities launched a skillful , exquisitely executed legal operation . The methods they have used ? delay and technicality ? have since been successfully used in thwarting legal rights in cases all over the South involving schools , voting , and public accommodations . Some 315 Freedom Rider arrests were made throughout the spring and summer of 1961 . Of the 315 defendants , 279 appealed their convictions in Mississippi courts . It is now thirty-four months since the Freedom Rider eases first went to the courts . Because of the delays and the failure of the federal courts to act swiftly and decisively , most of these cases ? except those in which the defendants gave up for lack of bail money ? have now been processed only through the county court , the next to the lowest step on the judicial ladder . A few of the convictions have been decided , and affirmed , in the state circuit court . None has yet been decided by the Mississippi Supreme Court . If the Mississippi high court affirms the convictions , the United States Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unforeseen delay . Then the local prosecutor will have to decide whether to set the cases down for retrial and start the whole process over again , if ( in accordance with customary practice ) the Supreme Court 's mandate permits him to do it . In the federal courts themselves , the first suit against the Mississippi segregation statutes was filed by the defendants in June 1961 . Twentyseven months later the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered an injunction against future arrests , but did not interfere with the cases still pending in the Mississippi courts . Years could elapse before the United States Supreme Court finally determines the real question : whether federal courts can and should enjoin obviously groundless state court prosecutions whose purpose is to nullify federal law . The estimated outlay required for exercising clearly established federal rights in entering the white waiting rooms in Jackson has been more than $2,000 ( including $1,500 cash bail ) for each of the Freedom Riders who appealed his municipal-court conviction as high as the state circuit court . The moral damage has been incalculable . Why It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this anemic judicial performance is a lone aberration . Having begun my career as law clerk to a great federal judge . I have perhaps even more reverence for federal judges than do most lawyers . Having engaged in private practice for twenty-five years , I feel the practicing lawyer 's normal reluctance to criticize judges . As a law teacher , I must be wary of denigrating the calling which my students are approaching . But the plain fact is that the lower federal courts are not doing the job for which they were established . Unless these courts are activated , and soon , the consequences will be serious . Denial of clearly established legal rights violates the pivotal compact of the open society , whose terms are acceptance of present law in return for effective access to the processes of orderly change . Time and again , the Negro has resisted the preachments of separatism and violence . Yet who is to blame him when he feels that litigation has too often been a sham ? But while protection of minorities from invidious discrimination is a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is not the whole of it . Individual freedom is many-sided ; it must include , within limits , even the freedom to implement wrongheaded and neurotically prejudiced attitudes . The Negroes themselves would suffer , along with the whites , if racial equality had to be purchased at the price of the broader freedom . They are entitled to as good a society as the whites now enjoy ? not to a Southern police-state society . Little Rock and Oxford provide no more useful model for the future than does South Africa . That is why the lower federal courts are so important . It is up to them to reestablish the rule of law , which has been so severely impaired by the lawlessness of state officials , without depreciating the general freedom of our society . And it is up to the President , the United States Supreme Court , and Congress to provide them with the support they so desperately need to execute their mission .                    @
