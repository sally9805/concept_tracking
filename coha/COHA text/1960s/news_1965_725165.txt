txt Dame ! Myra Hess , one of the leading pianists of this century , died at her home here last night . She ! was 75 years old . Dame Myra , who had been in : ( failing health for several ; Imonths. died peacefully in her ! 130-year-old Georgian house in ; St. John 's Wood , a residential ; ' area just north of the center of London . She had been living retirement . except for occasion-I al teaching , since Oct. 31 , 1961.1 On that date she gave her ! last public performance , play-. ing at the Royal Festival Half here in a program commemorating the 21st anniversary of the ! end of the Battle of Britain in World War II . A rheumatic con- dition that began to affect her hands halted her concert career . Despite illnesses during her retirement , Dame Myra retained a lively interest in music . She followed radio concerts and would go out now and then to attend recitals by promising pianists . Dame Myra was beloved by London concertgoers to a degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began in World War II , when she organized and directed lunchtime concerts at the National Gallery . They continued for six and onehalf years , during which time Dame Myra , who contributed her services , played more than 120 solo recitals . She also participated in chamber-music programs . The concerts were heard by more than 700,000 persons , each of whom paid one shilling . The Queen Mother Elizabeth , who was then the Queen , was a frequent visitor to the concerts . She later described her visits as " some of the happiest hours of the dark times through which we have passed . " Worldwide Following On her 75th birthday this year , Dame Myra Hess was honored by a British Broadcasting Corporation program of her recordings and comments , and she was showered by birthday greetings from friends and admirers throughout the world . One of these tributes was a performance by the violinist Isaac Stern of " Happy Birthday , " in a special broadcast . Myra Hess was born in Hampstead , near London , on Feb. 25 , 1890 . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Orthodox Jew . taught them Hebrew and familiarized them with the traditional melodies of the Sabbath service . The child displayed musical aptitude at an early age . At 5. she could play bits of tunes on the piano and improvise accompaniments for them , although she had had no formal study . A local music teacher then began to give her weekly piano lessons , but within two years the pupil had surpassed the teacher as a musician . At 7 , she was sent to the Guildhall School of Music , where she studied with Julian Pascal and Robert Orlando Morgan and won the gold medal for piano-playing . In 1902 , when she was 12 , Miss Hess won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music , and for the next five years she studied with Tobias Matthay . The Turning Point Many years later , she said : " The turning point in my career . came when I began lessons with Tobias Matthay , whom I consider the greatest inspira- , tional teacher I know of . I had a startling awakenning to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamed . He taught me the habit of enjoying my music as music , and . that was the chief factor in , finally molding me into a pianist . " On Jan. 25 , 1908 , the year : after her graduation from the ; Royal Academy , Miss Hess ! made her recital debut in London . Strangely , in view of what . . was to follow , she received only , brief reviews , stating little more , than that the debut had taken ' place . In November . 1908 , Miss Hess : appeared at Queen 's Hall in . London as soloist with Sir : Thomas Beecham and the London Philharmonic Orchestra in ' Beethoven 's Piano Concerto No. : 4 . Engagements with other orchestras followed , but they did little to gain recognition for the young pianist . A partial explanation was that Miss Hess , then as later . was an unspectacular perform-. er who scorned virtuosity for its own sake . After these tentative steps toward a career , Miss Hess withdrew from the concert stage for further study and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing con-1 certs , Miss Hess was discovered ' by London audiences , and she . at once assumed a status of eminence among women pian-. ists . She was not a militant feminist , but it did annoy her to be called a woman pianist . " Why should I be called a. ' woman ' pianist ? " she once asked . " There are good and had artists . Plain ' pianist ' is good enough for me . " Miss Hess made her United States debut in New York 's Aeolian Hall on Jan. 17 , 1922 . Richard Aldrich of The New York Times said of it : " Miss Hess is a strongly individual artistic personality , ' ; self-possessed , reposeful ; but ' ! . she is one who is devoted wholly , to expounding the music she ' plays and who takes no thought , of injecting her personality into it , or of making a display of her powers as a performer . " She appeared in the United1 States almost every year thereafter except for the World War II years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last New York recital , at Hunter College . Reviewing her on one of her later tours . Richard Gilman of : The New York Herald Tribune ! wrote : " She was always a poet , sensitive and exquisite , finely ' touched and richly gifted , an . interpreter of the sacerdotal 1 kind  --  dedicated and absorbed 11 and self-effacing . But she has1 ripened from a lyric poet to an ' ' ? epical one . " In 1936 , King George V conferred on Miss Hess the rank of Commander of the Order of the British Empire . In 1941 , King George VI made her a Dame Commander for establishing the lunchtime concerts at the National Gallery . Canceled Long Tour When Britain entered the war on Sept. 3 , 1939 . Dame Myra was packing her bags for what would have been the longest tour of her career , taking her across the United States and on to Australia . To the dismay of her managers , she shut up her piano and canceled all engagements outside Britain . She joined the Women 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children to the ! country . Almost immediately she had ' , the idea that resulted in the : National Gallery concerts . The first one was on Oct. 10 , 1939,1 the last , April 10 , 1946 . By then , ; 1,698 musical events had been presented in the series . Bombs did not stop the per- ' formances . During one bad : spell of air raids , the piano was moved into the basement , and ! the concerts continued . And ' once when a time bomb hit the ! Gallery , the concerts were moved across Trafalgar Square to South Africa House for few days . " Our first ambition was to ; provide an antidote to the pre- ; wailing sense of doom and destruction . " Dame Myra once : said . " Gradually we found we1 were realizing the ideal that ' music should ' have an integral ; part in the life of the nation . " Several years after the war . ' Dame Myra was giving a recital at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania , when a hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the audience began to scream and rush for the doors . Dame Myra , who had been through zv war , was not about to be upset by a bat . She watched the confusion with some amusement for a ; while , but soon she became im- : patient . Finally , even though ; the bat was still flitting about , ' she asked coolly , " Shall we go : on ? " And , turning back to the ! piano , she did . Dame Myra was known for , carrying her own piano stool with her wherever she appeared . Her hunched figure and hairstyle were so familiar that those who did imitations of her did not even have to say whom they were mimicking . When she was younger , Dame Myra liked motoring and tennis as hobbies . In later years . her recreations , which included bridge , were quieter . Dame Myra never married . One of her closest associates over the years was Anita Gunn , her secretary and traveling companion since 1931.         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
