The six-month rule of Premier Aldo Moro 's coalition government reads like The Perils of Pauline . The experts were certain Moro would be brought down by strikes , growing inflation , the faltering economy or just the incompatibility of his coalition partners-the Socialists and the Christian Democrats . But , just like Pauline , the Moro government survived every major crisis and even began to have a look of permanence . Then , last week , as Italians put it , the coalition slipped on a " buccia di banana " - banana peel . On a minor vote on what had not even been a political issue , Moro 's government was toppled . <P> The collapse came in the Chamber of Deputies over a negligible item in the budget-the provision of $238,000 in aid to private schools , which are mostly Roman Catholic . The Socialists , led by Veteran Pietro Nenni and , as always , anticlerical , abstained . But this time they were joined in their abstention by an odd lot of Communists , Liberals , Monarchists and Neo-Fascists . Even worse for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deputies left the chamber before the roll call . As a result , the government fell four short of a majority . <P> Understandably annoyed , Moro handed his resignation to President Antonio Segni , who accepted conditionally but asked Moro and his Cabinet to remain in office until a new government could be formed . It may take some doing , since Moro has long been under fire from right-wing members of his Christian Democratic Party , who resent the " opening to the left " through which Moro brought the Socialists into the government . Socialist Nenni has been under equally sharp fire from leftists who charge that he has given in to Moro time after time on what were fundamental Socialist demands . <P> This has been the trouble all along in the Christian Democrats ' weird amalgamation with the Socialists . With one ideology clashing head on with another , there has been simple deadlock . One result : an economy in serious trouble . This might seem a domestic Italian matter , but it inevitably rubbed off on the U.S. , for it was the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make their dubious plunge into the apertura a sinistra . <P> Conceivably , President Segni could call for new national elections . What seems more likely , however , is that Moro 's caretaker Cabinet will continue its somewhat bumbling rule until it can rearrange another center-left coalition to continue nursing the inflation-weakened Italian economy , which was recently stabilized by an infusion of $1.2 billion in foreign credits .
