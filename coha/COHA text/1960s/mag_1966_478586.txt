Why honor systems rarely work . . . and why a hardhanded ( but softhearted ) policing system is the only practical remedy on most campuses . Almost everyone I know remembers having cheated in school . I am now a professor of mathematics ; time has dimmed my memory of how it feels to sit in an examination room , frightened because uncertain of what was wanted of me , anxious for a good grade to please my parents , and wondering how many of my neighbors had crib sheets . Last year I was made chairman of a faculty committee asked to recommend procedures forminimizing cheating and to establish standards for academic honesty . In some sense I was already an expert in the field , having myself been punished in 1942 for writing freshman English papers for my dormitory neighbors at the University of Michigan . ( That was my first experience in writing for money ; this is my second . ) But during the year we worked , we found there were in fact no experts . My own experience was of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitions are elusive . Our most surprising discovery , once we added reason to experience , was that a good definition of academic dishonesty already goes a long way along the road to its reduction . What is so hard about a definition " There seem to be two divisions : cheating and plagiarism , though most cheating ( e.g. , copying a neighbor 's exam ) is a sort of plagiarism . Our own English department issues to freshmen a document which begins : " Plagiarism is literary theft ? intentional or unintentional . It is the use of a unique idea or phrase which does not originate with the user without proper acknowledgment of the source . " For its length ( one page ) and its audience , it is a fairly clear and educational warning , but in a large university it falls far short of covering all academic crimes . It has , for example , nothing to say to a student in a freshman physics laboratory who may invent answers to his lab-manual questions , instead of actually doing the experiment and recording the data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is n't science , nor yet plagiarism . Suppose a student , pressed for time , has to turn in a paper on Roosevelt 's First Hundred Days . He goes to a fraternity file and finds a paper with that title . He does n't copy the paper , or even read it , but he does copy down the bibliography . Then he goes to the library , consults precisely that set of references , and puts together his report in half the time it would have taken to start from scratch . His paper doubtless turns out to resemble strongly the one he found in the files , but was it plagiarism ? A chemistry student stands with a textbook outside the auditorium where his final exam is to be given , muttering to himself a sequence of key formulas and derivations . At the gong he rushes to his desk ( no longer holding the book ) and writes down a whole page of elusive data before even looking at the questions . He could n't possibly have remembered it five more minutes . Is his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plagiarism , or laziness and plagiarism , can not possibly he drawn to cover all cases and present a clear guide to students and academic prosecutors . But there is another definition which can handle the same problem much better : it is the definition of the assignment . When asked to write on Roosevelt 's First Hundred Days , what is the student really being asked ? To teach the professor what went on in the spring of 1933 ? The chances are that the professor already knows better than the student ever will . Can the student improve on a hundred studies done by professional historians and biographers , not to mention the memoirs of the principals ? Again , certainly not . Can he condense it all to 1,000 well-chosen apt phrases never before used ? Impossible . I say the student is being asked something like this : " I want you to learn to use the library , and to learn to read and to write . In this assignment I am asking you to submit to me a document which will be partial evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have given you a topic as a focus for this exercise , and of course you 'll learn something about 1933 as you go , but that is only part of it . I want you to read at least ten different views of the era you are studying ( there are hundreds ) , and I want you to find those ten by the same method you would use to find the hundreds if you wished to , just so you 'll get used to the method . I want you to put the main points down on index cards , classify them thus and so , and to do it in such richness that the classification you make will have some bearing on the ease with which you will be able to use the material when it is time to write . Then I want you to outline your argument , put it down in good English sentences , and provide enough footnotes so that the reader will know which statements are your syntheses and evaluations ( if any ) , which are " facts " reported in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by other people . Finally , I want you to remember what you 've done , so that next time you 'll have a more practiced hand at this sort of labor . " The actual document you submit is thus only part of what I want from you . It is traditional to give you a grade on the basis of your paper , and not to follow you around the library and the fraternity house as you do your work ? more than traditional , it is convenient . This means I have to infer from your paper how well you 've done what I am asking . Please make your work of such a nature that the inferences I draw are correct . If I find I am deceived by it , I will want to explore with you the errors which led to my deception . If I find the deception was deliberate , I shall be angry . " I have here condensed the presentation of the assignment far beyond what actually should be done . Such a statement ? already more illuminating than the definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be forgotten if it is not repeated , expanded , and enforced . The enforcement should not be punitive until it has become obvious that the deception is deliberate and malicious , but enforcement must be unremitting if Ralph .4 . Raimi is associate professor of mathematics at the University of Rochester . He took B.S. , M.S. , and Ph.D . degrees at the University of Michigan ? with time out for wartime Army service and a postwar Fulbright year in Paris . His specialty is Junctional analysis , and he has had a dozen research papers published in the professional journals . 70 CHEATING IN COLLEGE it is to have any effect . It will not do for a professor to say to himself , " These are honorable students , literate and well-intentioned ; I wo n't insult them by looking for plagiarism in their work . " Such an attitude is not only sentimental ( and convenient ! ) it is destructive of an opportunity to teach . From the fifth grade on , in the schools , children are being asked to " write reports . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about termites and write a report , " the assignment goes . The kid gets out an encyclopedia , turns to Termites , finds 2,000 words , and transfers 500 of them to his teacher . If he is an articulate child , the sort who ends up in college , he pleases ? even awes ? the teacher by this performance . He is not aware of plagiarism or bad faith , and he goes on in the same way , with increasing elaboration , until he comes to us . Can we then turn our backs on him and say , " He is honest ; I trust him " ? or , worse , " He is plagiarizing ; I despise him " ? Both are an abdication of our task . We must tell him carefully and often what we want from him , and correct his errors of scholarly practice as carefully as we correct his non sequiturs and dangling participles . This means we must notice when his paper shows signs of having been put together so literally from other men 's work that not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We must call him in , asking him to bring some of his sources , and point out by the verse how he has erred . Otherwise , crime gradually grows out of the unnoticed lapses . The student who begins his career with Termites from the World Rook ends up expelled from the university for a similar use of Duns Scotus . Surely this is a preventable loss . Now let us turn to another type of student misfeasance mentioned above : the construction of a crib sheet for an exam . Professors of literature ( a field particularly subject to plagiarism ) feel more sanguine here than professors of chemistry , say , or mathematics . A crib sheet is nonsense when the examination involves , for instance , Natural Justice in Conrad 's Early Novels . The assignment ( one hour on that subject ) is sensible and clear , and cheating impossible or meaningless . If the professor of English literature were to give a multiple-choice exam , one hundred questions involving authors and characters , in a list of ten novels ( none of which actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon he as common as it is in chemistry and physics examination rooms . Is it because chemistry is " that sort of subject " ? I think we must deny it . It is true that a chemist must have a hundred , a thousand , formulas at his fingertips before he can discuss a theory of chemical equilibrium or crystal structure . But this isreally no different from the thousands of grammatical formulas one must have at an instant 's notice before one can speak sensibly of the style of Browning . As long as exams consist of word lists or canned " derivations , " crib sheets will flourish in any subject . sightly so . I studied physics in my youth , and remember questions like , " Derive the formula relating electrical and thermal conductivity . " The answer to this question was a sequence of mathematical equations which I had memorized along with forty other " derivations . " I might as well have memorized a poem in an unknown language , for all the understanding of physics the exercise gave me . Who Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shame lay in the successful memorization . Those of us with a good memory scored high . Those of us who were fond of beer the night before an exam or who were honestly contemptuous of the whole silly affair made out crib sheets . Who was the criminal there ? If my physics professors had seriously asked themselves what questions would distinguish understanding and knowledge from confusion and ignorance , they could have come up with questions which would have rendered crib sheets as meaningless as they are in the humanities exams . But they would have to face a number of unpleasantnesses : long hours of paper-grading and very likely a shocking appreciation of how little we had learned . Thus , lists of formulas engender cheating in students precisely because they represent cheating in education . Once the purpose of a course is seen by the student to be worthy of a university , it becomes a course in which only the criminals can cheat . Very well then ; what about them ? First of all , where du they come from , how did they get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academic community where scholars old and young pursue the truth with devotion , giving no thought to honors and wealth . To some degree this is true . It would be entirely true , I am sure , if there were no honor or wealth to he got from scholarly pursuits . It would also be true that under such circumstances our university population would n't be 10 per cent of what it now is . Not that honors or wealth are the only attractions by which the oth-r 90 per cent are brought to us ? only that man do-2s not live by wisdom alone . We must recognize two things her ? : first that without reward of a mundane sort almost nobody would seek knowledge ; second , that there is no shame in this state of affairs . The tradition of the community of disinterested scholars must not blind us to the memory that even the most devoted of us was set on this path by a father 's praise or the pleasure of pleasing a teacher ? some reward not intrinsic to the performance . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on rewards by that majority of our students who do not aspire to a life of scholarship at all , but who still will enter the world vastly improved by whatever contact with scholars we were able to give them . Not only is our scheme of credits and degrees useful in persuading young human beings to overcome their natural reluctance to work ; but , because these tokens represent a certain achievement to the outside world , they have a monetary value . This is a novelty in our civilization . A hundred years ago , a college graduate was no better fitted to build railroads or grow wheat than his less-educated brothers . Technology , business , farming , salesmanship , navigation , and war had little to do with what went on at Yale in 1850 . A man with a taste for learning might well have got something indirectly valuable ? like the ability to shine at a dinner party , or even perhaps a truer view of the motives of men ? but no man ever left Yale able to command thereby a high starting salary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But today knowledge is wealth , and college degrees represent knowledge . We professors are the guardians of the integrity of these degrees . We can not ignore the fact that they become devalued if some students receive them by stealth . Where Honor Codes Work It seems , therefore , strange that in some colleges the guardians are the students themselves . I refer to the various sorts of " honor codes , " whose main feature is that examinations are not policed by professors or other proctors . Students who enter such a college generally sign a pledge not to cheat , often including a pledge not to tolerate cheating in others , and occasionally an obligation to report other cheaters to a student court of some kind . The proponents of such a code believe that the assumption of honesty will almost always have moral force enough to ensure honesty . They remark that many distinguished colleges and universities have such codes ( e.g. , Princeton , Wesleyan ) , and that they work . It seems to me that the inauguration of a selfby enforced code offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If we had a community where the ideals in question were universally observed , and any violator instantly and with horror ostracized , then each new entrant would naturally and joyfully take up his proper responsibility . This appears to be the case in some of the old or small colleges which operate a successful honor system . These places have a long tradition of gentlemanly behavior , dating from a time when life and wealth did not depend on the honors bestowed by the school , and when the university code was only an extension of the aristocratic code these college men had already been bred to . Such an atmosphere has had great endurance and has infused its values into each entering class ? even when ( as today ) a substantial number of the newcomers have fought their way tip from anything but a hereditary aristocracy . Where , on the other hand , there exists a whole community outside the code , a newcomer has his choice . and self-enforcement fails . This appears to be the case in most American universities . Far from being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average student would be horrified at the suggestion that he reprimand or report such cheating when he sees it . Such an attitude held , for example , at the U. S. Air Force Academy in its 1964 scandal . Some cadets ? so their parents complained ? were forced to resign for having failed to report cheating which came to their attention . The parents of these students were angry ! They claimed that honor dictated silence . And this in a college where the code explicitly asked students neither to cheat nor to tolerate cheating in others . And where the students explicitly agreed . And where the gentlemanly ideal is written into every regulation . Not long ago an honor code was drawn up by some students at my own campus , given a great deal of publicity , and voted on in a student referendum . It failed . After talking to many students I have come to the conclusion that it lost many votes because it carried no demand that students report observed violations . On the other hand , if the proposed code had included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been lost from those honest students who would not want to subject themselves to public wrath as informers . The lesson I drew from the referendum is this ; There is evidently so much cheating that the students were asking us , the professors , to enforce the law , They approve of this law overwhelmingly , of course , but they are too close to the malefactors in age and culture and common interest to dare take the enforcement into their own hands . Now some professors take the attitude that it is beneath their dignity , or otherwise repugnant to them , to police exams . 1 must reply that no necessary task is beneath anyone 's dignity , nor should it be repugnant if it is honest and productive . However , it may nut be the best use of a violinist 's time to have him patrol the aisle of an examination room when someone else can be hired for the same job at a smaller salary . I would urge universities to provide all possible assistance from testing services , the office of the Dean of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower cost than scholars ' time , purify exam procedures and render their results more accurate . If the time ever comes when cheating on campus is carried on by so tiny a minority that the average student 's instinctive reaction to an offense is horror ? at that time , but not before , we will he able to trust a student-enforced honor code . What is needed , on my campus at least , is a period of time during which the proper tradition can be established . But first the following steps must be taken . ( 1 ) Reduce the occasions for dishonesty . Let written papers be assigned on novel and imaginative subjects , rather than on some generality on which a myriad of past student papers have been written . Let routine work , such as daily or weekly lists of mathematics exercises , or translations in elementary language courses or elementary laboratory work , go ungraded . Let the exams on which grades are given be so constructed as to favor those students who did conscientiously perform their weekly tasks . Exams should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief communications between students , or a reference to a crib sheet , should have little value . Where a multiple-choice exam must be used , neighboring students should be given different exams . ( 2 ) Make the punishment of dishonesty evenhanded and consistent . It is obviously in the interest of justice that punishments be equal for equal crimes . It is also more comfortable for the policeman to know that his action is not itself an injustice , by virtue of its rarity . If universities were to adopt the view outlined in the following paragraphs , embodying its legal aspects in appropriate legislation , professors would count their role greatly clarified and their effectiveness greatly increased . It seems to me that students and deans would benefit in the same way . A lone professor should never punish a student for academic dishonesty . In dealing with plagiarism , he should consider himself a citizen-policeman and a teacher . In dealing with cheating in exams he is entitled to delegate the role of policeman to a professional . Papers written outside of class , however , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty as a policeman in this context is clear . Having discovered evidence of exam cheating , the proctor should report the case to an agency of the Dean of Students , which alone is charged with judgments and punishments . The professor should only be asked for expert testimony and advice ; he should never bear the moral burden of a prosecution , even if he were to wish to . Any student in danger of being summarily punished by a professor who does undertake the role of judge should have the right of appeal to the Dean 's office . In cases of plagiarism , the professor should first talk to the student in the hope that a misunderstandingis involved . There should be no question of crime and punishment yet . A report of the incident should be sent to the Dean of Students . Of course the student should know such a report is being made . If the case seems serious enough . or if it is a second or third incident involving the same student , the Dean 's office should initiate a hearing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report has no idea whether further action will result , Meanwhile , as assurance to professors who fear that their reports of violations will lead to unjust punishment , we should follow a policy of light punishment ? maybe admonition only ? for first offenders . Most first offenders will not be punished at all , for a report to the Dean 's file should generally serve as sufficient warning . It should be known that the transcript of a student 's academic record ( courses taken , grades received ) will never contain a mention of such admonitions ; they are irrelevant to the purpose of the transcript and would tend to cast into doubt the validity of his real accomplishment . Where , through repeated offenses , that validity is genuinely compromised , the student should merely be expelled . Thomas Hobbes observed , in Leviathan , " Covenants without the sword are but words . " Hobbes must have said somewhere else that the use of the sword in the absence of a proper covenant is equally fruitless . We professors have a contract with our students ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be educational and clear , our examinations meaningful and relevant . Then . once we are sure our part of the code is observed , we have the right , and indeed an obligation , to insist upon theirs .
