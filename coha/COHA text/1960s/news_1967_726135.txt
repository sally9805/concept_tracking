txt " They 're the same ones who do it on their income tax and other bills , " said William T. Prendergast with a calm understanding that comes of 20 years as Chicago 's city collector . " Human nature , " he said with a wave toward the crush of persons who had waited until the 11th hour to invade the first floor of City hall to buy their 1967 city vehicle licenses . Prendergast then proceeded to prove his point . He thumbed thru a pile of applications yesterday comparing them with late ones from last year . Same Applicants Again Many of yesterday 's applications had come in one year to the date of last year . " If we extended the deadline we 'd be right up against the same crowd , " he said . Prendergast 's office will be open today from 8:30 a. m. to 4:30 p. m. to handle all stragglers . The deadline for displaying city vehicle stickers is midnight tonight . Drivers tests at the city 's three state vehicle license offices were suspended for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtain state license plates . Several thousand persons flocked to the offices in advance of the midnight deadline tonight for displaying the plates . The offices , which will be open today from 8 a. m. to 4:30 p. m. , are at 5301 Lexington ay. , 9901 South Park ay .. and 5401 Elston ay . Many of those who flocked to City hall yesterday said the record snow and a shortage of cash had prevented them from purchasing city licenses earlier . Virtually all who chose to wait in line ? there were 13 lines inside the collector 's office and one huge one around City hall ? said they did so rather than spend a dollar or two ordering their licenses at a currency exchange . He Has Excuse " I wanted to save a buck , " said Martin Zakes , a policeman . " It never occurred to me to go anywhere else but to City hall for my license . Besides , I 'm part Bohemian . " Zakes , like many other policemen in line yesterday , had worked many hours of overtime because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ license earlier . " That 's right . " said Webster Johnson , a state employe " 1 did n't have the money before and I came here to save the handling charge. - . . . At least two wives among the crowd blamed their husbands for their trek to City hall yesterday , Valentine 's day . " My husband would n't do it . so here I am. " said Mrs. Lorrie Greene , 6040 N. Tripp ay . Mrs. Mildred Moretti , 706 Cornelia ay. , concurred . " But we ca n't drive the car , anyway , ' , she said . " It 's stuck in the snow , so why hurry ? " George Korda , 1234 Bosworth ay. , a mailman , said he did n't mind traveling downtown on his day off to get a license . Besides , his wife suggested it would be a good idea ; he could do the shopping , too . An Hour in Line Getting into City hall to get the licenses meant at least an hour 's wait outside . Once in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most . " Watch the signs : they 'll tell you where to go ! " said Richard Valentino , the office 's chief license coordinator , as police admitted a dozen or two into the office at a time . The dash from the door to desks where applications could be filled in and then to the cashier resembled the television commercial where a group of shoppers tries to stuff a food basket in 30 seconds . And while the crowds at the front door were keeping Valentino busy , Patrolman Joseph O'Meara found things just as hectic at the exit , where he was under the constant siege of those who tried to enter there . Sales Are Heavy " Around the front , around the front . " O'Meara spent most of the day saying . But the doorway proved to be too large for one officer . and there were some who got by . A few even walked in backward . Prendergast announced that 587,618 vehicle licenses have been sold since the period began Dec. 15 . He said there were 913,939 passenger vehicles registered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motorists would wait until today to get the licenses . Just after the figures were given three Brink 's , Inc. , I guards stepped warily into the City hall throng and made their way into the cashier 's office . To give you an idea of how brisk the business has been there , the guards walked out with six bags containing cash and checks . " Over two million dollars in them , " said a cashier .
