In times of crisis , West Germans still rely on indestructible Chancellor Konrad Adenauer . At the height of the Berlin trouble last fall , 32% told public opinion pollsters that they wanted him in charge ; Berlin 's tough Mayor Willy Brandt was right behind him with 31% , while popular Economic Minister Ludwig Erhard carried only 6% . Since then , the picture changed , partly because things looked quieter at Berlin-at least for a while . In the latest poll . Erhard-whom der Alte usually treats like an office boy-is now the first choice for Chancellor , with 28% , while Adenauer is down to 22% , Brandt to 21% . Poorest showing is Erich Mende 's , with only 1% wanting him as Chancellor .
