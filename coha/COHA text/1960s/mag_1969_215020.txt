NOTHING , it seemed , could halt the bloody feud between the army of Lebanon and the Palestinian Al-Fatah guerrillas-not the intervention of Gamal Abdel Nasser , not the warnings of the U.S. and the Soviet Union , not the menace of an uneasy Israel . From Tripoli south to Sidon , from dusty villages on the edge of the Mount Hermon massif in the east to the fashionable sea front of Beirut in the west , violence continued as Arab fought Arab . In Tripoli alone , at least 18 were dead . <P> At issue was a question that may yet haunt other Arab governments as the guerrillas grow stronger or bolder : Where , and in what numbers , should the fedayeen be allowed to operate in their " war to the death " against Israel ? Jordan 's King Hussein confronted the guerrillas over the issue and ultimately backed down , giving them virtually a free hand in his border areas . Two weeks ago , the issue brought violence to Lebanon when the army cracked down on the fedayeen for having moved into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Minus the Trademark . Initially , Arab leaders took the fedayeen 's side . Many openly roasted Lebanon 's President Charles Helou for refusing to allow them free movement . But last week , shocked that the crisis showed no signs of letup , the Arabs grew uneasy . Nasser invited both sides to conciliatory talks . Lebanese Army Chief Emile Bustani promptly flew into Cairo with proposals for a truce . In agreeing to the meeting , Helou insisted that " Lebanon 's sovereignty should not be less than that of any other Arab state . " In other words , he still wanted final say about where the guerrillas should operate . <P> Al-Fatah Leader Yasser Arafat , on the other hand , decided to milk world opinion before attending the Cairo meeting . He first flew to Damascus , where he persuaded his compliant Syrian hosts to suspend their rule barring Lebanese and Western newsmen from the country . As a result , Arafat had a sizable EastWest audience for the first formal press conference he has ever held . Oozing confidence , the guerrilla leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth of beard but without the tinted wraparound sunglasses that have become something of a trademark . <P> Arafat breathed fiery defiance . " Arab revolutionaries have a right to fight anywhere , " he said . He insisted that " American imperialism is behind all actions hostile to the Arab nation . " Playing on the pride of the Lebanese in their business acumen , he warned that unless Israel is wiped out , " it is bound to be proved that Israelis are better businessmen than Lebanese . " <P> Customary Insouciance . There was still scattered terrorism in spite of the maneuvering in Cairo . Near Sidon , an oil-storage tank belonging to the TransArabian Pipe Line Co. , a U.S. oil subsidiary , was spectacularly set ablaze . In Beirut , dynamite charges exploded harmlessly outside the Phoenicia Hotel and on Hamra , the principal shopping street . But in cities and refugee camps , riots and sniper attacks seemed to be abating , and discussions between Helou and Lebanese Moslem leaders replaced the angry recriminations of the week before .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
