MEN POSSESSED BY GOD by Jacques Lacarrire. 237 pages . Doubleday . $4.95 . <P> In an age that jokes about masochism , the 4th century ascetics of Egypt and Syria are hard to take seriously : St. Maron , who spent eleven years in a hollowed-out tree trunk ; St. Acepsimas , who wore so many chains he had to crawl on all fours ; Macarius the Younger , who felt so guilty about swatting an insect that he sat naked in a swamp for six months until mosquito bites made him look like a leper . <P> But there was method to their masochism . Jacques Lacarrire , a French historian who spent some time in surviving desert monasteries , has written a tender , subtle account of the hermits . Their existence , as Lacarriere unfolds it , was not so strange as it seems at first glance ; and it was perhaps a reasonable alternative to the world they left behind . <P> Crabs of the Desert . Throughout the upheaval and persecutions of the late Roman Empire , Christians believed that the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practiced a life of denial . But paradoxically , it was not so much persecution as acceptance that finally drove Christians to solitary life in the desert . When Constantine established Christianity as the Roman Empire 's official religion , the faithful needed a new enemy to remain in tension with this world , and they discovered it in themselves . The martyr-saint who had been thrown to the lions was replaced by the ascetic-saint who was beset by private visions of demons . In the " barrenness and calm abstraction of the desert , " man could come to grips with his true nature , writes Lacarrire . Life 's superfluities dropped away ; the moral choices were starkly clear . Ascetics went for years without seeing or talking to another person . They hacked out inaccessible niches in cliffs or burrowed in the sand like crabs . <P> The stylites , as they were called , perched on platforms as high as 80 feet ; lived on olives ; occasionally were struck by lightning . Stylites like St. Simeon found " refuge in a tree as Noah found it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a condemned world in its last agony and lead the life of a bird in the branches and the wind , a bird possessed of God and the thought of Heaven . " <P> Society of Angels . The ascetics , Lacarrire thinks , were not really alone . By conquering temporal time , they had gained a kind of eternity . By taking to the desert , writes Lacarrire , the ascetic joined a brotherhood that " made him one with all men of the past , since Adam . There were angels and demons , then the dead with whom he frequently spoke-the saints and martyrs of early Christian times , and also the dead of a distant past , Greek , Roman and Egyptian , whispering in the darkness of the tombs . All these surrounded the ascetic and constituted his true society , his millions of unseen companions . "
