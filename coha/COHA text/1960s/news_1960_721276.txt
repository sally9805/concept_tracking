txt WASHINGTON , June ** these attitudes the Castro clique does not , in our opinion , speak for the Cuban people . " This was the concluding sentence of an editorial in this newspaper today . The " attitudes " referred to were the steady demonstrations by Premier Castro of hostility to the United States and approval of the acts of international communism . The sentence brings vividly to mind what Soviet Russia did on the basis of a similar conclusion with respect to the people of Hungary , its own " Cuba , " in 1956 , even though , unlike the judgment expressed by this newspaper , the overwhelming evidence was to the contrary . And it sharply illustrates the vital fact of the " cold war " : that the measures of self-protection international communism can and will take in the presence of a near and serious danger are unthinkable for a government and people dedicated to the ideals of democracy and the ethics of Judeo-Christianity . The Castro regime in Cuba , now gratefully awaiting Premier Khrushchev 's first personal expedition to Latin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sphere of Soviet influence , controls territory which is virtually contiguous to the United States . This control by a hostile government , and Castro 's is progressing to that status , could turn Cuba into an anti-American military base closer to the popular and industrial nexus of the United States than any American base abroad is to Soviet Russia 's . Its element of peril to our national security would be made much larger if the Castro-Khrushchev entente spreads into Latin America , and if ? as already indicated  --  the Government of Communist China is afforded Cuban facilities for anti-American operations . These dangerous potentials are fully understood in Washington . But in the present aspects of this situation of peril the United States is limited to sending notes of protest against Castro 's " campaign of slander . " Contrast what the Soviet Union , unrestrained by the ideals of democracy and the humanitarian ethics of this nation and people , did in Hungary in 1956 . Protecting ' Hungary To guard against the maturing of anti-Russian factors the Kremlin had retained occupation troops in that satellite nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was being directed by Elmo Gero , First Secretary of the Communist party . There followed a peaceful student demonstration in support of nationalist , but not antiCommunist , demands for a relaxation of these practices , including one that Imre Nagy , who had headed a moderate Communist Government 1953-55 , be recalled to power . Suddenly the demonstrators were fired on by Government troops , Gero declared martial law and called on the Russian garrison to clear the streets . These acts set off a violent revolt , and in a week the people had installed Nagy as Premier of a Government in which were representatives of the democratic parties . This Government denounced the Warsaw Pact , which had given the Russian forces the pretext to remain in Hungary , declared Hungary 's neutrality and appealed for protection to the Western powers . Immediately the Kremlin moved fifteen additional military divisions into Hungary , and its 200,000 troops and 4,000 tanks crushed the revolt . In Budapest 1,000 armored military vehicles destroyed buildings and shot down thousands of people on the streets . Meanwhile , Western powers stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its military intervention had been " invited " by a legitimate Government , representing the will of the people , and from any question of its implicit position that Russian national security rewires " friendly " ( puppet ) regimes on its borders . These things can be done for " regional security " by a bloody dictatorship , unhampered by a free political opposition , a free press , or by labor unions free to strike in a 3rucial defense industry ( as the International Association of Machinists s now striking that industry in the United States ) . These things the United States can not and would not lo against a threat to its " regional security " that now , with the subitantial encouragement of Moscow uid Peiping , is shaping up in Cuba with a more ominous direct potential of peril than Hungary 's to the Kremlin in 1956 . Those Administration critics who : omplain that United States inter  --  ational " power and prestige are waning " can discover one of the reasons in the problem posed by Cuba .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
