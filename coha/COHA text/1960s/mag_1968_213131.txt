FOR the fourth time in six years , the Pulitzer committee last week gave no prize for an American drama . The committee is correct . No American play of the 1967-68 season merited an award . While it may pique national vanity , an esthetic dry spell is no novelty in the long history of drama . The sands of mediocrity have sometimes silted over the theater for 2,000 years-for example , between the titans of Greek tragedy and the genius of Elizabethan England . The lackluster quality of contemporary U.S. playwriting and the dearth of substantial new talent are simply a gap rather than an omen . The conventional and obvious scapegoat is Broadway , but this is pure fallacy : Broadway , with all its faults , has presented , honored and sustained every major U.S. playwright . <P> The current plight of American drama reflects attrition of imagination rather than Philistine commercialism . The leading playwrights are faltering or repetitive . Films , TV and advertising have lured away young potential dramatists , thus giving volatile intellectual fashionmongers an excuse to depict the theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather is the latest work of the best U.S. playwrights . For more than two decades , Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams have dominated the American stage in much the way that Hemingway and Faulkner once dominated the novel . Miller is dramatically the descendant of Ibsen and socioeconomically the child of Marx . Williams is dramatically the descendant of Chekhov and psychologically the child of Freud . At present , they seem to have depleted their inheritance . <P> Old Dogs , Old Tricks . Miller 's latest play , The Price , is a problem drama calcified in the technique and mentality of the late 1930s . Underlying all of Miller 's thought is the conviction that if society is changed , man is redemptively altered and restored to respect , purpose and value . But the catastrophic events of 20th century history have shattered the presumptions of the problem play . Man 's ineradicable genius for evil has reduced the doctrine of social engineering to puny tinkering . Playwrights like Beckett , lonesco and Genet have abandoned admonitory Ibsenite finger-waving for a nerve-shattering look into the abyss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , innately unjust and thoroughly absurd . In the future it may be said that they held a broken mirror up to the nature of the age , but for now they have rendered Miller obsolete by altering the central focus of theater from sociology to metaphysics.
