" When you get older , you get more ambitious , " bubbled evergreen Schmalz King Rudolph Friml , who at 81 still takes a daily dip in the chilly Pacific , follows it up with five minutes of handstands and six hours at the piano . Convinced that " everyone is tired of unmelodious music , " Friml hopes that his first new operetta since 1934 , a " real Frenchie " confection called Rendezvous in Paris , will tinkle onto Broadway during the coming season . <P> <P> From his hermitage in Cornish , N.H. , publicity-proscribing Author J. D. ( The Catcher in the Rye ) Salinger , 42 , proclaimed a new declaration of independence . " It is my rather subversive opinion , " he wrote for the dustjacket of his forthcoming book , Franny and Zooey , " that a writer 's feelings of anonymity-obscurity are the second most valuable property on loan to him during his working years . " With customary obliqueness , Salinger pointedly failed to state what he considered a writer 's most valuable property , proceeded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " My wife has asked me to add , however , in a single explosion of candor , that I live in Westport with my dog . " <P> <P> Up to the library of Milwaukee 's Marquette University lumbered a truck from Washington , bearing about one-quarter of a weighty new gift : the personal and public papers of a 1935 alumnus , the late Republican Senator Joseph R. McCarthy . Donated to the university by the Senator 's widow and ex-research assistant . Jean Kerr McCarthy ( soon to become the wife of Civil Aeronautics Board Member G. Joseph Minetti ) , the first shipment of 30 packing cases contained mostly press notices of the Senator 's storm-tossed career . But the remaining material , with its dossiers on his btes rouges , would undoubtedly be more incendiary-and possibly libelous . Said an official of the Jesuit university , who assumed that Mrs. McCarthy was screening the files before she packed them : " I 'm sure she 's using her head . " <P> <P> While Cuba 's cultural commissars pondered converting Ernest Hemingway 's 13-acre Finca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hemingway , was more concerned about his literary monument . Spending what may be her last weeks at their longtime Cuban home , Mrs. Hemingway , as per her husband 's request , destroyed personal papers , culled his " hundreds of thousands of typewritten pages " for marginal notes like " burn this " or " this is pretty good " as a guide to what to publish and what to let perish . Among the manuscripts that Mary Hemingway may or may not ever release : The Dangerous Summer , a chronicle of the 1959 Spanish bullfighting season excerpted last year in LIFE ; recollections of the literary denizens of 1920s Paris ; and a novel described by Hemingway himself as " a big one all about the land , the sea and the air .
