txt BERLIN , Dec. ** a deserted street corner the melody of " Silent Night , Holy Night , " played by a one-armed organ grinder , broke the silence . The frost on the trees , the snow in gardens and the glow of candles on Christmas trees softened the ugliness of the wall that runs across this tortured city like an aching wound . The five holes the communist East German regime broke thru the wall to permit limited family reunions over the holidays tonight were deserted , too . Steady Flow Thru Day All day long , from pre-dawn until late afternoon , a steady stream of happy , expectant people had passed thru them . They carried gifts , food , delicacies , flowers and fir branches . They were on their way to spend Christmas eve , the first since 1960 , with spouses , parents , children , and other relatives from whom they have been forcibly separated by the communist border barrier . But all had to return again by midnight , when the wall again became the deadly barrier that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city apart .

He promised that the city government would do everything possible to extend the family reunion scheme beyond the Jan. 5 deadline . Churches in both parts of Berlin tonight were crowded for Christmas vespers and masses . The theme of the sermons was the same everywhere . It was one of gratitude and hope that this temporary opening of the wall was the beginning of a new era.
