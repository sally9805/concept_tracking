SIGNS AND WONDERS by Franoise Mallet-Joris. 408 pages . Farrar , Straus &; Giroux. $6.95 . <P> Franoise Mallet-Joris writes in the tradition of mile Zola . Her plots are complex and thickly populated , and her characters move up and down through the floors of French society like a gilt-and-glass Parisian elevator-and , often , at about the same speed . <P> Inexplicable Union . In this , her sixth novel , she deals with the France of the early 1960s , when De Gaulle was extricating his nation from the Algerian war and rabid rightists were murdering Arabs and detonating plastic bombs throughout France . Her protagonist , Nicolas Lclusier , is a great bearlike , brooding man . He had written a successful novel about his Russian mother , who had apparently died in a Nazi concentration camp . Now he is astounded to learn that his mother survived , is living in Germany , and is married to one of the former camp guards . <P> This inexplicable union of victim and executioner so unsettles Nicolas that he can no longer write fiction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a new magazine , which assigns him to explore France " as you would the Amazon . " He is accompanied on the quest by Marcelle Landau , a beautiful young woman who , because she had been a homely child , still thinks herself ugly . They become lovers , and since each is a grade A neurotic , the romance takes a rollercoaster course . <P> Along the way are vivid and beautifully described vignettes of rural France . The pair meets O.A.S . assassins and silky entrepreneurs , dislocated settlers and stranded Arabs . To Marcelle , these encounters are part of the breath of life , but to Nicolas they are increasing evidence that the world consists only of " mawkish absurdity and lunatic atrocity . " His crack-up is inevitable and comes with measured solemnity . Each family confrontation-with his brother , who is a worker priest , with his doting father , his enigmatic mother-erodes a bit more of Nicolas ' will to live , and so he kills himself . <P> The Demands of Love . Author Mallet-Joris , 36 , counts among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an art that is beyond many women writers . She is also a master of the trenchant phrase : a businessman has an " Easter Island head stuck on a penguin body " ; a cantankerous father " needs to see his son unhappy in order to love him . " She is one of those rare writers who can create worlds that readers instantly accept . Love , and its demands , are what her novel is about . Man 's only choice , she says , is to accept the demands or die .
