Man prides himself upon his growing mastery over nature , but in the ultimate biochemical analysis nature remains the master of man . With their most sophisticated laboratory glassware and corrosive reagents , scientists can set off any one of a few thousand bio chemical reactions in an hour or two , but they need to generate unnaturally high temperatures to do the job . Nature can instantly produce millions , or possibly billions , of such reactions at normal body temperature . The agents that effect such biological miracles are enzymes , commonly referred to as " nature 's catalysts . " They provide no nourishment to animal or man , yet they are essential to the metabolism of all creatures . They are the honest brokers or middlemen of life , mediating countless actions between living creatures and their environment and within the creatures themselves . <P> Last week , two groups of scientific researchers jointly announced that they had succeeded for the first time in synthesizing an important enzyme in the laboratory . The triumphant research teams came from Manhattan 's Rockefeller University and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Working independently from different starting points and along different routes , both of the research groups reached the same end point : synthesis of ribonuclease , an enzyme found in the pancreas ( sweetbreads ) of cattle that helps to break down ribonucleic acid . <P> How They Did It . The Rockefeller researchers , Drs . Robert B. Merrifield and Bernd Gutte , began their experiment with a tiny bead of plastic , onto which they hooked a 124-link chain of amino acids . There are 20 different amino acids , and , because all proteins , including enzymes , are made of amino-acid chains , the acids have been recognized for many years as the " building blocks of life . " The exact sequence and identity of successive acids in the ribonuclease chain were recently established , and the Rockefeller team 's job was to link them , one at a time . The painstaking process involved 369 chemical reactions and no fewer than 11,931 different laboratory steps , taking three weeks in all to complete . <P> The Merck researchers , Drs . Robert G. Denkewalter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared groups of six to 17 amino acids in linked series . They then put these groups together to form the ultimate 124-link chain . Their product turned out to be the same as the Rockefeller synthetic enzyme ; its identity was proved by the way in which it broke down ribonucleic acid . <P> Dependent Generals . Ribonucleic and deoxyribonucleic acid are the fundamental chemicals that determine the nature of living things-whether they will grow normally or abnormally , whether they will reproduce their kind or perish . The two nucleic acids are as dependent on their loyal enzymes as a general on his junior officers . The bovine ribonuclease that has been synthesized will have no immediate value as a treatment for any of the ills of animals or man . But its synthesis shows that man is coming closer to his goal of emulating nature at the most basic , biochemical level . <P> The first synthesis of an enzyme , said Merck 's Dr. Max Tishler last week , should provide much of the knowledge needed for researchers to devise and produce " the next generation " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
