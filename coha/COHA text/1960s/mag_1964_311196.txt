RADCLIFFE by David Storey . 376 pages . Coward-McCann. $4.95 . <P> <P> The love that dare not speak its name has become the neurosis that does not know when to shut up , and the reader may be forgiven for receiving glumly the news that still another fictional treatment of homosexualism has been published . And , in the case of Radcliffe , despite a fitful display of considerable writing skill by young British Novelist David Storey , the gloom is justified . <P> Radcliffe is a " big " novel of the kind which , in English literature , at least , has been turned out almost exclusively by U.S. writers since World War II . Weighty issues are mentioned weightily , and the kettledrums are almost never silent . Before Storey is through , he has confronted the reader with the alienation of the individual , the decline of the aristocratic tradition , the nastiness of the mass , the calamitous Christian duality of soul and body , and almost everything else that could be considered a factor in the decline of the West . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kingsley Amis , many British critics praised Storey wildly , some of them using the dread word " major . " <P> Leonard Radcliffe , the novel 's hero , is a frail , foul , moonstruck young man , the son of a troubled aristocrat who has taken a job as caretaker of his decaying family 's decaying mansion . From his childhood it has been clear that Leonard is brilliant and in some way blighted . For several chapters , the best of the book , it seems that Storey intends to revive that abandoned form , the psychological novel . His dry , astringent description of Leonard 's decline into adulthood is drawn from that curious middle ground between detachment and involvement that Dostoevsky used . <P> But the novelist loses control when Leonard falls under the influence of Victor Tolson , a muscular , mindless working-class homosexual who lives in the housing project that surrounds the Radcliffe mansion . Tolson lurks about the shrubbery like the hound of the Baskervilles , and sexual symbols parade through the paragraphs wearing sandwich signs . Superfluous minor characters become infected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then drift off to irresolution . The dry prose becomes dewy . There are long , dare-taking sex scenes of the kind that , in he-she form , would seem overwritten in a Frank Yerby novel . Storey 's tactic is not to ask the reader to tolerate homosexualism intellectually , but to acquiesce emotionally , thus merely increasing the reader 's impatience . <P> What is left when the scenery stops falling ? Well , the book can be seen to be an enormous , lavender metaphor : Leonard is soul , Victor is body , opposed in unnatural self-division . The most pompous piffler since Colin Wilson takes 376 pages to plumb this irrelevancy to its wuthering depths . One vote for Mailer.
