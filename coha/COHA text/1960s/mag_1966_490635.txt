THE TALK . OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment THE longer the fighting goes on in Vietnam , the clearer our impression grows that war may have been a more efficient institution in the past than it is now . We are speaking of war in a narrow military sense , and , of course , with nuclear weapons very much in mind . We doubt if before their advent any country , and particularly one the size of the United States , would have hesitated , perplexed , over how to proceed against an enemy with which it was locked in bloody combat . In pre-nuclear times , we think , a country 's only conceivable response would have been to let fly with everything it had , to empty its arsenals of their most powerful weapons . But , as has often been said , today 's most powerful weapons are too powerful , having far less to do with conquest than with extermination , including self-extermination . Such weapons do not lend themselves to quick , instinctive use ; even the most outspoken " hawks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangely silent when it comes to espousing their employment . The less limited the power of a weapon , it would appear , the more limited are its uses , and the effect of this paradox , in our opinion , is to impair the efficiency of warfare . The soldier in the field today , unlike his counterpart of the past , lives with the knowledge that his government is unlikely to accord him the maximum support of its arms . It is an apparent deprivation . No matter how well so-called conventional weapons may serve his needs , he can hardly be blamed , it seems to us , if he chooses to imagine that things might be a whole lot better for him , in the mud or the jungle , were his government of a mind to go all out on his behalf ; as far as he is concerned , he is being asked not only to fight for his Life but to do it fastidiously , taking care to overcome his would-be murderer in a certain approved manner . In our view , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether American or Communist . Because of the constant nuclear threat , he is denied the dream of conquest . The promise of that lustrous goal once sustained many a gallant heart throughout a bitter campaign , but these days the men in both armies go into battle fully aware that they are not necessarily fighting for victory . Half the time , it is difficult to tell whether they are serving as armed diplomats or as soldiers without portfolio . Repeatedly , they hear their commandersin-chief proclaim that the true purpose of the fighting is a negotiated peace . In the past , leaders refrained from such talk until after the tide of battle had unmistakably determined the victor and the vanquished . Indeed , it might be argued that this very determination was the great achievement of war , for only after the determination was made could die efficiency  --  or usefulness , or expediency  --  of war be demonstrated at the peace-conference table . Negotiation , so called , proceeded only at that table ; the victor 's brand of wisdom prevailed , for better or worse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war were settled , at least temporarily . But today , it appears , there is no such clear-cut arrangement in view . It is a draw  --  a negotiable stalemate  --  to which both sides seem to aspire . In this country , at any rate , one hears little talk of victory ( or defeat ) , although now and then an especially impassioned man may summon up a vision of this kind of outcome . The other week , one such man , the chairman of a congressional committee , declared , paraphrasing the words of a famous general , that " in war there is no substitute for victory . " He meant to exhort his listeners , but it is just possible , we suspect , that some of them may have been set to reflecting on whether there might not be a substitute for war . It is a tangled question . We ourself , for example , are n't at all clear whether a world without the availability of force would necessarily he a safe one , but we do have the sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day as an agency for settling political accounts . It concerns us deeply that people everywhere may conceivably be living through a terrible cultural lag , either unaware of the cataclysmic changes in our world or skeptical of their existence . If there is such a lag , it would be vastly preferable , to put it mildly , for it to he recognized by us , soon , rather than eventually by historians , or perhaps archeologists . Heliport WITH the official opening of the new heliport on top of the Pan American Building last week , regular commercial helicopter service between the Grand Central area and John F. Kennedy International Airport became a reality . To observe the inauguration of this new era , we abandoned our office for the better part of a day to take in the opening ceremonies . These began with a vast cocktail party and luncheon laid on at the Waldorf-Astoria by Pan American World Airways for what a Pan Am public-relations man described as " prominent leaders in the business world and the New York community " and for members of the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Press Kit . " The prevailing mood was one of glowing success following a four-year fight against various objectors to the idea of having a heliport in the Grand Central area , lest it create excessive noise and constitute a potential danger to those living or working in the Grand Central and Murray Hill areas . The people on the dais included Juan T. Trippe , chairman of the board of Pan American World Airways ; Roger M. Blough , chairman of the board of United States Steel ; His Eminence Francis Cardinal Spellman ; Keith S. McHugh , Commissioner of Commerce for the State of New York ; Alan S. Boyd , Under-Secretary of Commerce for Transportation ; Frank D. O'Connor , the president-elect of the City Council ; and Robert L. Cummings , president of New York Airways , which operates the helicopter service . Cardinal Spellman delivered an invocation that began , " Mighty Lord , Father of us all , we Thy children come together joyfully to place the new Pan American heliport under your abiding protection ; " Mr. Trippe proclaimed that " urban helicopter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking note of the efforts of the anti-heliport forces , declared , to powerful applause , that " the power of negative thinking has suffered a very real defeat ; " and Mr. O'Connor offered corroboration by emphasizing " the absolute absence of negative thinking in the approach of the pioneers in aviation . " Vigorous handclapping thereupon roiled the clouds of smoke drifting through the banquet hall . At the conclusion of the lunch , the guests were invited to proceed by limousine , in groups , to the Pan Am Building for what the Pan Am people called " a courtesy ride " in a helicopter before the heliport should be opened for regular commercial service , at six-thirty . We chose to make our way down to the Pan Am Building on foot , where , having been swept up by a crowd of hanqueters descending from limousines , we checked into a new Pan Am ticket office , near the Park Avenue ramp . There we met a tall , jovial vice-president of Pan Am named James Montgomery , who told us , " All the airlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from passengers about delays in getting to and from Kennedy Airport . As things stand , passengers can get here from Europe in six and a half hours by jet , and then they have to spend two hours clearing customs and getting into town . People coming in from Bermuda are even less happy about the de lay , since it takes them as long to get from Kennedy into midtown as it takes them to get from Bermuda to here . As for departures , if you use the East Side Airlines Terminal to get out to Kennedy for an international jet flight , you have to check in at the terminal an hour and forty-five minutes before your flight time . If you use this heliport , though , to go to Rome , say , you check in only forty-five minutes before your flight time , and your haggage is taken from you right here by Skycaps , who 'll put it on the scales , and you do n't see your baggage again until it 's delivered to you at the Rome airport . The actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And for domestic flights you save thirty-five minutes by using the heliport . The fare is seven dollars one way . A tremendous convenience . " With Mr. Montgomery , we took an elevator to the fifty-seventh floor of the Pan Am Building , where we admired pictures of two heliport lounges under construction  --  one of them nicely panelled and furnished in seventeenthcentury-inn style , the other done in more or less contemporary style  --  and then we ascended , by escalator , half a floor to a sort of staging area , a gray-tiled expanse partly submerged below the flight deck on the roof of the building . A sliding glass door afforded us a view of steps leading up to the heliport , a concrete-paved area of more than half an acre . There was no helicopter in sight at that moment , but we were aware of a chopping sound outside somewhere . We wound our way around the waiting throng and came face to face with Mr. Cummings , the president of New York Airways . " This is an unbelievably exciting day , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started out in 1960 with the idea for this heliport , and we owe its existence to the tremendous vision of Juan Trippe  --  Pan Am has agreed to cover our losses for some time . This is the largest rooftop heliport in the world and almost three times as large as the Wall Street heliport  --  and it 's approachable from all four sides , which is a very important consideration . It 's right on Park Avenue , and it 's close to Forty-second Street . The building itself has twenty thousand people working in it , and within ten minutes ' walk of it there is a population of five hundred thousand  --  greater than the population of Denver . Our object is to serve the center of the community . We 're using twin-rotor Bocing-Vcrtnl 107 helicopters , capable of seating twenty-five passengers . Every day , we 'll have eighteen trips out to Kennedy and seventeen hack . At the moment , we can cope with eight hundred and seventy-five passengers a day . " We asked Mr. Cummings what he thought of the objection raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the helicopters . " Honestly , those objections are not realistic , " Mr. Cummings said . " The signature of the blades  --  that whop-whopping sound  --  is no great probkm . We 've had very few phone calls of protest since we started high-density test flights , in October . On the other hand , we have had numerous calls for reservations on flights from this heliport  --  six hundred of them so far , two of which are for next June . " Edwin Baur , New York Airways vice-president in charge of flight operations , joined us , and we asked him about the noise problem . He did n't think it was much of a problem . " There were complaints when jets went into operation , too , " he said . " The average ambient noise on a mid-Manhattan street is higher than that of a helicopter . We 've run some studies showing that these helicopters make less noise than a six-wheel diesel truck . " With a man from the Federal Aviation Agency who was standing nearby we brought up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the area , and asked him whether a heliport on the edge of the East River in the midtown area would n't be a safer bet . " Safety is safety , " the F.A.A. man said imperturbably . " Whether one person is concerned or a million arc concerned , our safety standards arc the same . As high as we can make them . " We thanked the F.A.A. man , and THE NEW YORKER 21 " T. V. Lindsay . Right ? " the Messrs . Cummings and Baur , too . Then we mingled a hit more with the waiting crowd , and spotted Michael Quill in the thick of things . We asked him what he thought of the new helicopter service . " I have had occasion in the past to use these machines , and I think they 're a wonderful system of transportation , " Mr. Quill said emphatically . " The heeleocopter is not so suitable for mass transportation , perhaps , hut , in my opinion , it is going to be ideal for smaller cities . " The wh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the clothes of technicians nut on the roof were flapping violently . Within a min ute or so , a large blue-and-white helicopter settled on the roof . " Ladies and gentlemen , kindly hold on to your hats and other loose articles you may have with you , " a blue-suited functionary called to the waiting crowd , and when the helicopter 's passengers had debarked , we went out on the roof and boarded the machine for a trial spin around the midtown area . A Pan Am man sat down next to us and said , " The procedure is that the helicopter rises to an altitude of ten to fifteen feet , then moves simultaneously upward and backward , so that the pilot can keep the launching pad in sight , for about a hundred feet , and then goes forward with a lifting motion . The initial maneuver has the advantage of champing that feeling of acrophobia when the helicopter goes over the edge of the building . " We understood what he meant in a minute or so , when the helicopter began a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being in an elevator that had shot right through the roof of the building and continued in a trajectory that took us over the edge . Suddenly , the streets in the Grand Central area were yawning beneath us at an awesome depth , and we had a sweeping view that encompassed both the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and the George Washington Bridge . We were given a brief swing west to the Hudson , east over the middle of Central Park , down the East River , and back to the new heliport . Just before landing , we passed close by the tip of the Roxy-style spire of the Chrysler Building , which in the afternoon sun was standing in a kind of Camp glory . After a while , we found ourself back in the heliport ticket office , where champagne  --  courtesy champagne  --  was flowing and catered caviar was being handed out while squads of Pan Am public-relations men rushed here and there getting things ready for the official opening of the heliport . The ceremony took place on the concrete roof , which was illuminated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor Wagner  --  with Cardinal Spellman , a wispy figure , standing between them  --  cut a scarlet ribbon held by two stewardesses . ( Cardinal Spellman took the first commercial helicopter flight out to Kennedy Airport , where he transferred to a jet that took him on a Christmas mission to Vietnam . ) By the time the ceremony was over and the heliport was officially in business , it was pretty cold , windy , and noisy up there . 1 ? rHE Birds Eye people advertise - I-  their Selected Whole Mushrooms as coming in " small medium-size " and " large medium-size . " Peace on Earth " p EACE on Earth ' is a slogan I- that 's thrown around at Christ-mas , " said a dark-haired girl standing next to a ten-foot pyramid of cardboard boxes on whose sides appeared , in wild Pop-Op array , a photograph of Elizabeth Taylor , accompanied by two quotations from Dag Harrimarskjiild ; a medieval print ; a quotation from the Beatles ; a photograph of an Asian child ; a quotation from Adlai Stevenson ( " No preordained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft options . Neither greatness nor even freedom lies that way " ) and one from John Kennedy ( " We shall do our best to build a world of peace where the weak are safe and the strong are just " ) ; and photographs of an atomic cloud , a military figure sighting a weapon , a South American peasant , and the Watts riots , in California . " People react superficially to ' Peace on Earth , ' " the girl went on . " Store windows always have the words written in Olde English , with Nativity scenes and Santa Clauses . Our theme is ' Peace on Earth , ' too , but we want people to see what that means in 1965 . We show anguish and suffering as well as joy  --  for example , pictures of Vietnam and the Watts riots  --  as a challenge for people to change . " The girl , Mickey Myers , was a student from Immaculate Heart College , in Los Angeles , and , with a classmate , Paula McGowan , she was directing workmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Madison Avenue in setting up seven hundred and twenty-five cardboard boxes for I . B.M. 's Christmas display , which would extend a hundred and thirty-five feet , and would consist of walls , towers , and pyramids formed of a hodgepodge of boxes hearing fragments of advertisements , sections of billboards , news photographs , quotations , and  --  in a variety of styles  --  the words " Peace on Earth . " " We have a duty to put things that are around us into a new form , but cuteness and cleverness usually do n't work , " Mickey explained . " This is something there 's no formula for . " As I.B.M . computers clattered and blinked in the background , Mickey , who was wearing a brown sweater , a gray skirt , and green stockings , pointed to some quotations on a nearby tower of boxes and said , " They 're from five men we considered to be disciples of peace in our time , and who have died recently : John Kennedy , Adlai Stevenson , Dag Hamrnarskjiild , Pope John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders of a task force of twenty-two students who created the display , had already worked on it for two and a half months in California , under the direction of Sister Mary Corita Kent , head of the art department of Immaculate Heart , whose serigraphs have been shown at the Metropolitan Museum and the Museum of Modern Art , and who currently has one-man shows in a number of cities , including Boston , Washington , and New York . The boxes were completed in California , then numbered , folded up , and shipped here . Paula , who was wearing a bright-green dress , looked down the long , uneven row of boxes facing Madison Avenue . " I wanted to get a sense of continuity between the inside and the outside , " she said . " The photographs of people , for example , carry the people outside inside . We wanted people to realize that they are the ones who make the peace  --  that peace is n't a passive thing . " The girls finished setting up the show December 9th , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Immediately , it was attacked by a number of I.B.M . personnel and outsiders , some calling it " unChristmassy " and others detecting in it a protest against the Vietnam war . Certain changes were quickly made in the display . To a prominent " Peace on Earth " were added the words " To Men of Good Will  --  Luke , " and quotations from Pope Paul and President Kennedy were removed or added to so that they would not be read " out of context . " THE NEW YORKER A public-relations man explained later , " We took soundings , and found there was public feeling against it . We 're sensitive to comments such as these . Any corporation would he . " On December 13th , Mickey and Paula moved on to the Scarahaeus Gallery , at 223 East Sixtieth Street , where they set up a group show of sculpture and other works by various students of Sister Corita 's . Sister Corita herself arrived the next week  --  a one-woman aggiornameta ? , pretty , cheerful , gentle , and dynamic . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her latest serigraphs , which , like all her others , are built around quotations . " I take things out of context and play with them , " she told us when we looked her up . The show included such diverse sources as advertisements for Wonder Bread and words by Rabbi Abraham Heschel and Father Daniel Berrigan , who recently became co-chairmen of Clergy Concerned About Vietnam . An example of Sister Corita 's penchant for varied sources can he seen in a short article called " Art and Beauty in the Life of the Sister , " which she wrote for a hook called " The Changing Sister . " In it she quotes or refers to Albert Camus , Federico Fellini , John Cage , Peanuts , Cardinal Suenens , William James , an ad for Del Monte catsup , John Dewey , George Bernard Shaw , J. D. Salinger , Little Red Riding Hood , Pope Paul VI , and James Baldwin . She has taught art at Immaculate Heart College for the past sixteen years . " Charles Eames , who lives out there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sister Corita said . " Ile 's splendid . He speaks very simply but always asks the right questions , and he has honesty and enthusiasm . We use his films over and over again . " Each year , in August , Sister Corita makes a series of prints . " This year I did thirty or thirty-five , and printed about a hundred of each . 1 work very fast , and others help me mix paint and clean up . It 's a standing joke that anyone who drops in in August helps . " She added that she works without any studies or notes . " / tried making notes during the year , but I lost them when it came time to print , " she said , laughing . About her pi-inn-flak ing she said , " It seems a nice thing to do . I like the kind of connections it makes with people . I went through a formal training in which the look of the thing was all that was important , but nowadays I think I 'm just a straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quoted in many of Sister Corita 's prints . " I think there 's something very direct and refreshing about them , and something very good about the words of their songs , " she said . " A boy in our school  --  a music major  --  wrote a paper on ' The History of Salvation According to Paul , Ringo , George , and John . ' He says the whole history of man is a kind of love affair between God and man , and the words of the Beatles ' songs are often very similar in content to Scripture words ; they have a freshness in that context . In California , incidentally , some people feel that the Beatles  --  and certain nursery rhymes as well  --  are part of a Communist infiltration . " She smiled again , sadly . " That 's one of the complications you live with . " Brightening , she went on , " While I 'm in New York , I want to see Fellini 's Juliet of the Spirits , ' and a preview of Albee 's adaptation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see ' Hogan 's Goat , ' and I want to see the Jean Tinguely exhibit at the Jewish Museum . I mw the Spanish Civil War film ' To Die in Madrid ; ' it was devastating . I saw two wonderful short plays in the Judson Memorial Church  --  one by Gertrude Stein and one by Ruth Krauss . The Krauss play was a great kind of satire , done in that big , nice barn , with lots of dancing , and it was perfect  --  millions of times better than that great , lavish ' The Royal Hunt of the Sun , ' which went on and on . I 'm very much interested in the American Place Theatre , which is in St. Clement 's Church . It 's like what used to go on in churches . Theatre and service feed into each other ; they ought never to be separated . " Sister Corita spoke of the current " junk " art , of Pop Art , and of the art of the absurd . " I have a theory , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't work . It 's that there 's nothing that 's ugly . If you try this out , you find you block out fewer things than if you just go around looking for what is beautiful or great . I ca n't think of these artists as negative and despairing  --  or else they would n't be doing it . If you notice and care about things , there is tenderness . In the midst of all the screaming for help , you have a hope that someone is going to answer . " She mentioned meeting Edward Alhee at a party at Virgil Thomson 's apartment , in the Village . " I told him I thought ' Virginia Woolf ' was very tender , " she said . We asked what he said . Sister Corita laughed . " I ca n't remember , " she said . " I think he just sort of smiled . " Extras A RURAL lady we know ordered , by phone , a portable television set from a company that specializes in delivering such things . The clerk who took her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge for " de-luxing . " She asked the obvious question , which brought forth the answer " It means taking it out of the crate . "
