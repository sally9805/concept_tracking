When the Nationalist government jammed an anti-sabotage act through South Africa 's Parliament last spring , anti-apartheid Author Alan ( Cry the Beloved Country ) Paton asked , " What will be next ? To make lists of disapproved persons ? To confiscate their property and make them wear a yellow star ? " Last week a list of disapproved persons was indeed issued by the South African government , and Justice Minister Johannes Vorster explained blandly that the list merely " closes certain loopholes " of the law . <P> The 102 listed persons ( including 52 whites ) may attend no meetings , and any editor whose newspaper even quotes one of them is liable to three years ' imprisonment . If reporters were to ask Chief Albert Luthuli whether he will apply for a passport to attend the International Cultural Conference in Copenhagen , they could not print even a yes-or-no reply ; Luthuli , South Africa 's only Nobel Peace Prize winner , was the most prominent name on the disapproved list . <P> The gag applies even if the listed man lives outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer able to print articles by Party Leader Patrick Duncan , who edits it from exile in Basutoland . Actor-Playwright Cecil Williams may appear in other people 's plays-as long as he does not ad-lib-but no one can appear in his . Two Capetown city councilors are allowed to attend council meetings , but their remarks must be left out of the record . No one may publish cross-examination-or even scholarly legal briefs-by Abraham Fischer , defense counsel in South Africa 's mammoth treason trial and grandson of the Orange Free State territory 's first Prime Minister . <P> In South African newspaper offices , desk men have begun keeping the list next to their style books and headline charts . Reporting the trial of Union Leader Leon Levy , charged with attending a meeting , the Johannesburg Star said , " Magistrate H. J. Bosnian asked , ' How do you plead ? ' Levy : ( He did plead but his words can not be published ) . " <P> At week 's end , Vorster granted newspapers permission to print a listed man 's direct court testimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a forum to such persons . " Most editors were not inclined to test Vorster 's interpretation of abuse . Said Author Paton , who was still surprisingly unbanned : " What astonishes me is that a minister with so much power , more power than anyone has had since Hitler and Stalin , can take such savage action against people who have no power at all . It reveals to me the great anxiety of our rulers . "
