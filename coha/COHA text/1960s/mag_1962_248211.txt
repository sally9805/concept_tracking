The art film , long and easily identifiable by the Colombian coffee ( not popcorn ) served in the theater 's lounge ( not lobby ) has acquired a new trademark-The Walk . <P> The time is usually dusk , sometimes night , occasionally early morning . The scene is a street , somewhere on the outskirts of a large city , almost always deserted . A bird might light on a telephone wire or a tree shudder briefly by the wayside , but all else is still . The camera pans in on a woman ( Jeanne Moreau ? Monica Vitti ? Anouk Aimee ? Emmanuelle Riva ? ) . She is doing The Walk . Her hands flutter at her skirt , her hips tip from side to side , slowly , sensually . She walks past the tree , or telephone pole , or both , or a thousand of each . Occasionally , she stops , touches a fence post , a tree trunk , a street lamp , a spiny plant-should they all be construed as phallic symbols ? <P> Behind her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Marcello Mastroianni ? Alain Delon ? Eiji Okada ? ) appears . He is doing The Walk . His hands are sometimes in his pockets ; sometimes one hand is in one pocket ( curiously , two hands are never in one pocket , nor is one hand ever in two pockets ) . He may or may not be following the woman-it is almost impossible to tell because he , like she , seems in no hurry . The director ( Michelangelo Antonioni ? Alain Resnais ? Federico Fellini ? Francois Truffaut ? ) is definitely in no hurry . The movie ( La Notte ? L'Av-ventura ? La Dolce Vita ? Hiroshima , Mon Amour ? ) is 50 minutes long already , and still the woman is walking , the man is walking , and the only real involvement anywhere is occurring among people , who are not walking but sitting , scattered throughout the theater , nodding and telling each other how real , how honest , how truly artful . <P> <P> The Walk has very little to do with plot or motivation . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he walks ; she 's placid , suicidal , elated or enraged , she walks . The Walk has nothing to do with getting anywhere-no picnic , party or supermarket is ever set out for , much less reached ( in fact , when achieving a destination is of any importance , everyone slips into the nearest sports car or on any available elevator , never attempts to make it on foot ) . <P> The Walk serves no technical purpose other than , as its innovators tell it , to re-create the aimless wandering that is so much a part of Life . Asked why his characters walk so much , Director Antonioni is indignant : " Why did Joyce end Ulysses with a monologue ? Why does Bergman always talk about God ? "
