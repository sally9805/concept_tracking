HORACE WALPOLE ( 215pp. ) - Wilmarth Sheldon Lewis-Pantheon ( $6.50 ) . <P> <P> If a man is the son of a Prime Minister , he has a very fair chance of getting somewhere himself . Indeed , if he shares his father 's genius , as did the younger Pitt , he may become Prime Minister himself . But if , like Horace Walpole , he is as waspishly well-bred as his father was openhanded and bluff , he doubtless does better to observe than participate . As the great Sir Robert 's son , Horace Walpole had a ubiquitous entree as well as a tireless eye and the great world 's attentive ear . His letters , the most diverting in all English literature , provide a lasting mirror of the 18th century aristocracy that ruled Great Britain ; forged , as at times it fettered , taste ; commanded a style , established an attitude . <P> Walpole 's letters are as steeped in temperament as they are crammed with information : from an enjoyable ambivalence of attitude , Walpole must mock what he delighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain that in chronicling society , a monocle is no mere class ornament but an actual sharpener of sight . <P> The Amateur . If Walpole seems today the very voice of the ancien rgime , in his own time he had something of the avant-garde about him , even a touch of the enfant terrible . He invented his own fopperies , adapted his own fiction from the medieval , translated his own pleasures from the French . He had the ruling-class horror of being a professional , yet in his amateur way could claim with much truth that " no profession comes amiss to me . " He was a printer , an innovating builder , an M.P. , an antiquary , a historian , a novelist , a playwright , a collector of art . <P> As the supreme social chronicler of the age , he was not content merely to perambulate society himself ; he recruited an eavesdropper for every dinner table , a spy for every drawing room . In his own way Walpole ran a factory of anecdote and gossip , with duchesses doing piecework @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivery boys . But the products themselves were all personally hand-finished ; the letters proved as durably elegant as Lamerie silver or Sheraton sideboards . <P> Pain into Pleasantry . Everywhere the letters bear Walpole 's signature as well as his century 's . " The first step toward being in fashion is to lose an eye or a tooth-not that I complain-it is charming to totter into vogue , " could only beWalpole . Thus he turns pain into pleasantry , parliamentary battles into hair-pulling matches , the universe itself into a ballroom . With just as unillusioned a view , Horace 's father became the most successful of British administrators . The father was as philistine as Horace could be exquisite , but they were not too unlike -a cynical common sense governed the father , a cynical worldliness his son .
