Back and forth across the Carolinas and Virginias , where college basketball rates higher than barbecue , the schools of the Southern Conference torment each other with diabolic defenses , home-court advantages and 6-foot 11-inch carpetbaggers . A coach needs to gather not only his wits about him but four or five fine Yankee athletes as well , to get through the schedule with hide and pride intact . // This season Coach Lefty Driesell of Davidson College , Mecklenburg County , N.C. , proved himself the most adept gatherer . His Wildcats lost their second game , to St. Joseph 's in Philadelphia 's inhospitable Palestra , then reeled off 22 straight victories from Jacksonville , Fla. , to Madison Square Garden . The tiny Presbyterian school , highly rated academically for more than 125 years , was unbeaten in 12 league games and was the obvious choice to represent the conference against Providence in Philadelphia on March 8 , the first step toward a possible NCAA championship . But few things are logical in the Southern Conference , a strange assortment of public , church and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; 32 institutions have been members at one time or another since its founding in 1921. // Last week the entire season was thrown out with the leftover ham hocks . Davidson came into the Charlotte Coliseum along with seven of the conference also-rans to play it all over again in a three-day , single-elimination tournament . And as per custom since the dark ages of Dixie basketball , the tourney champion would be the conference champion . Even Virginia Military Institute , with the eighth best winning percentage , had a chance . Last year the Keydets eliminated regular-season champ Davidson in the second round , 82-81 , after Davidson Guard Barry Teague had taken what would have been the winning shot in the last seconds . The ball rolled the wrong way on the rim like a loaded die . // " It 's quite a job to get ' em up for the second night , " said Coach Driesell before the opening round last week . " I think that 's what happened last year . For the first game you 've got time to get ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do n't have a whole lot of time . We 've got the tourney plus three games before we go to Portland for the NCAA finals , but it all could be over tomorrow . That 's the frightening part of it . I think anybody in this tournament could win that gets a hot hand . " // Charlotte 's Chamber of Commerce tournament committee was packed with Davidson alumni and boosters . The city is just 20 miles south of the campus , and the Wildcats play half their home games in the Coliseum . Davidson people say Lefty Driesell has given them something to " be right proud of " at last . " I was graduated from Davidson about the same time Lefty graduated from Duke , " said one alumnus . " I recall we lost about 33 major athletic events in a row . So this team is a real treat for us . Lefty was an unknown when he came here . I saw Duke play right much when I was going to Davidson , and I do n't remember him at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , when most of the boys on this team were freshmen . Lefty did one thing . He went out and really sold boys on his product , Davidson College . " // One of the buyers was tall Fred Hetzel from Washington , D.C. , an All-America who made close to 60% of his shots this season . There was Don Davidson from Salem , Ohio , all-state in football and basketball as a prep and quick enough , even at 6 feet 5 inches , to handle opposing guards . And with them was a jumping junior from North Canton , Ohio , named Dick Snyder , who picked Davidson over 75 other schools that fancied him . In high school he was an All-America quarterback , all-state in baseball , honorable-mention all-state in basketball and a good student . Ohio State insisted on giving him a football scholarship , but Dick wanted to play basketball . Neither he nor his family had ever heard of Davidson . But Lefty , who works much faster than his native Virginia speech patterns would indicate , changed that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test , running the 100-yard dash in 10.3 and punting a football 54 yards , among other things . He plays center field and pitches for the baseball team , and the major league scouts faithfully attend every game . With scant practice he beat the school 's top triple jumper by two feet . // In basketball Snyder finished second to Hetzel in Southern Conference scoring this season and rebounded as if the floors were trampolines . Each game he guarded the best front-court man on the opposing team . In the opening round of the tournament Thursday his assignment was VMI 's all-conference Forward Charlie Schmaus . Snyder stayed closer to Schmaus 's jersey than Schmaus did himself and held him to 10 points , his lowest total of the season . Snyder scored 28 points and Hetzel 31 . Davidson won 86-73 . The nation 's longest victory string was extended to 23 , but the folks in red-dirt Mecklenburg County were edgy , especially Coach Driesell. // He entered the dressing room after the VMI game to find reporters talking to his players and growled to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He remembered the second-round upset of the year before , and so did everyone else . Waiting for Lefty the next night was West Virginia , several notches below the quality of the Jerry West , Rod Hundley and Rod Thorn days , but still dangerous . The Mountaineers , struggling through a rare losing season while a fine freshman team simmered , started shooting like Daniel Boone in their last regular game , embarrassing a good Virginia Tech team by a 54-point margin at Morgantown . In the first game of the tournament they shot a record 62% from the floor in beating George Washington . Perhaps this was the team with the " hot hand " to send Davidson 's intellectuals back to the classroom . // " We 're going to win it , " said West Virginia Coach George King before the tourney . " I 'll go on record on that . The kids think we 'll win it , and so do I. This has been an awful year for us , but now we have a new lease on life . We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winning streak and the worries of a second-round jinx , but it also had the overwhelming support of the fans , many of whom had helped fill the arena the previous year when the tournament had brought in $93,000 net and brought down the Wildcats . Guard Barry Teague 's sister Sharon , a pretty , dark-haired Charlotte student who helps lead cheers , put as much energy into the battle as he did , and Guard Charlie Marcon 's sister watched tensely from the stands . West Virginia had a chorus line of lovelies , a rooting section that strained to be heard and a red-bearded youth dressed up like a mountaineer and leaning on a long rifle . // At the start West Virginia threw up a zone defense that the CIA might have had trouble penetrating , and Don Davidson got into foul trouble , forcing Driesell to take him out . The backcourt was unable to get the ball in to Hetzel and Snyder often enough to take advantage of numerous Mountaineer ball-handling errors , and the Wildcats left at half time trailing by four points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember the comeback in Madison Square Garden against NYU . The pessimists had other arguments , one of them being John Lesher , a junior guard from Delaware who does not take a shot unless his West Virginia teammates put the long rifle to his head . After shooting only five times in the first game and making three he was under orders to be less timid . He had scored 14 in the first half . // Davidson kept its poise , as it has all year , even though West Virginia came out firing in the second half and quickly increased its margin to 13 points . Led by Teague , the Wildcats went to a pressing defense and slowly , as the scoreboard clock blinked the seconds away , sliced small pieces off West Virginia 's lead until they made it 68 all . With eight seconds remaining Davidson won a tip-off at midcourt , but Teague missed a desperation jump shot at the buzzer . A team that Davidson had beaten twice during the regular season was in overtime against the conference leader . // In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 74-70 lead . Hetzel scored on a jump shot with seven seconds to go , but it was the last basket of his college career . When Davidson got a time-out , only two seconds were left and West Virginia used them up . The next night , for the ninth time since 1954 , West Virginia won the tournament , beating William and Mary 70-67 in two more overtimes. // Mountaineer Coach King could sympathize with Lefty Driesell . The same thing had happened to him in his first year as head coach in 1961 . " They 're a fine ball club , " he said of Davidson , " but anything can happen in a three-day tournament . They tell us the tournament is necessary , but I 'd like to see some changes . I think it 's a shame that you have to play all season just for a first seeding. " // Staring at the pressroom floor after his defeat , Driesell insisted , " I still think we 're the champions . " The athletic directors of the Southern Conference , about $100,000 richer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
