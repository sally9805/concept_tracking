" I do n't want to bring on trouble , " purred Alabama 's segregationist Governor George Wallace . " I 'm a guest in Maryland . " But he was n't a guest to Maryland 's Democratic Senator Daniel Brewster . <P> Running against Wallace as Lyndon Johnson 's proxy in this week 's Maryland presidential primary , Brewster called Wallace a " trespasser , " a " stumble-bum , " and " a dangerous joke . " And as for bringing on trouble Wallace 's name might as well have been Joe Btfsplk . <P> Scheduled to speak at Cambridge ( pop . 12,500 ) , the Eastern Shore scene of bloody race riots last summer , Wallace was apprehensive . But when he was assured that besides his own small army of bodyguards , 50 state troopers and 400 Maryland National Guardsmen would be on hand to protect him , Wallace decided to keep the engagement . <P> At Cambridge 's volunteer firemen 's arena , he harangued a smaller-than-expected crowd of 1,200 . " If you 're tired of the trend in this nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to do something about it on May 19 . We shocked the liberals to their eyeteeth in Wisconsin and Indiana , and we 've got a chance to make their eyeteeth drop out here . " The crowd cheered . <P> The Other Side . Across town , 300 Cambridge Negroes were meeting at the Negro Elks Hall . For two hours they were exhorted by their local leader , gaunt , hot-eyed Mrs. Gloria Richardson , and a handful of outside speakers . But it remained for Lawrence Cundiff , 25 , a worker for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee , to really set them off . <P> " This is war ! " cried Cundiff . " Wallace is nothing but an Alabama redneck without an ounce of common sense . " Denouncing Wallace 's rally , which was going on just four blocks away , Cundiff urged : " Why do n't we see if some of us ca n't get in there ? " Out into the warm night poured the Negroes , with Gloria Richardson in the lead . <P> At Race Street , Cambridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bayonets fixed on their empty rifles , blocked the marchers ' way . " Stop this and take them back ! " Brigadier General George Gelston , commander of the Guard unit , yelled through a bullhorn to Gloria Richardson . The Wallace meeting , he told them , " is a complete flop . Do n't ruin your chances by going over there . It 's only half full . " A bottle arced out of the darkness and smashed on Gelston 's Jeep . Rocks were thrown at the Guardsmen , striking some . At length , Gloria persuaded the grumbling Negroes to retreat . <P> " Get That Man . " An hour later they were back . By now , Wallace was driving away toward Baltimore , but it made little difference to the Negroes . At Race Street they were again stopped by bayonets , and they sat down where they were . Shouted Colonel Maurice Tawes , a cousin of Maryland 's Democratic Governor J. Millard Tawes : <P> " Go back to your area or we are going to lock you up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use tear gas on them ? " Tawes demanded of Gloria Richardson . " We 'll sit here quietly , " she replied .
