 | Painted in DarknessThe remarkable story of an artist who did not discover his talent until he had gone totally blind ONE GRAY October morning , six years ago , I was lying in bed reading . Suddenly inside my head there was a brilliant flash . The book I was reading disappeared . The room itself disappeared . I found myself in a rage of darkness . I should have been prepared for this . Glaucoma had already taken the sight of one eye , and doctors had warned that the other eye was affected . But I had the irrational feeling that , if I simply ignored it , the grim thing that was stalking me would never strike . All the way to the hospital I kept telling myself it was just a momentary blackout . I clung desperately to this hope until doctors took it away . Then I went down into a pit of misery . All my life I had prided myself on my independence . Now it was gone . My work , as traveling auditor for C. W. E. Jordan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no close relatives , no established home , I was alone , lost in impenetrable blackness . For weeks , time stood still . Hands touched me , voices spoke , but they seemed far-off , unreal . Sometimes I would sit motionless for hours , silent as a stone . When the time came for me to  | leave the hospital , I was terrified . The Veterans Administration would pay me a pension for total disability . Social Security would add a little more . Otherwise , I had no funds , no place to go . I was living in a little town in West Virginia where I scarcely knew anyone . Finally I decided to go back to Savannah , Ga. , a town where I once had lived and had a few friends . In Savannah a small miracle happened . I thought I might try to do some writing , and so I advertised for a part-time secretary . I explained in the ad that I was blind and could pay very little . Even so , there were 40 applicants for the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her name was Dorothy . At first , I 'm sure , she simply pitied me . But pity turned to love . In time , we were married . So I was alone no longer . Even so , there were moments when I felt that I had simply dragged Dottie down to my own private hell . My attempts to write were a failure ; the black emptiness behind my eyes seemed to confuse my brain and sometimes when Dottie tried to comfort me I would lash out at her . One day , after such an episode , she said patiently , " I 'm going out for a while . Here 's a pad and pencil ; perhaps you 'll feel like trying to make some notes . " When she was gone , I sat there wondering what I could do to make amends . With the pencil I made a mark on the pad and drew my fingers across it lightly . My fingertips were more sensitive , now ; I could feel the indentation clearly . Too bad , I said to myself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least have tried to sketch something for her . It was true : I had never tried to draw or paint in my life . But now I remembered an etching that I had once admired , a tidewater scene with a sweep of tawny marshes backed by a dark pine forest . Well , I thought , it can do no harm to try . When Dottie returned and I handed her the pad , she was silent . " Who did this ? " she asked at last . When I told her , she said in a whis-  | per , " If anyone saw this , they 'd say you 're not blind ! " I began another sketch to show her how I had done the first one , measuring intervals and marking them with my thumbnail , drawing lines , tracing the indentations with my fingertips , filling in light and shade between two fingers laid flat against the paper . It was a strange thing : as I worked , the darkness that imprisoned me was empty no longer . I was seeing again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From that moment , I began to live once more . Day after day I worked at my drawing , sustained by the thought that perhaps I was attempting something unique . I made endless mistakes . But each one was a challenge , and it is in responding to challenge that a man knows for certain that he is alive . My technique evolved slowly and painfully . First I would concentrate on a subject for hours , sometimes days , until I could " see " the image accurately in my mind , in all its detail and color . For the basic sketch I used an ordinary soft-lead pencil . It made a wide line that was easy to feel . I always worked from the center outward . If I was attempting a still life of flowers , for example , I might center the first flower exactly . For landscapes I would start offcenter with a house or a boat or a tree , or other important object , and work outward from that . When the drawing was finished , f would tackle the coloring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with five rows of holes , six holes in each row . I asked Dorothy to put the greens in the first row , the darkest shade on the left , next darkest shade in the second hole , and so on . In the other rows she did the same with blues , browns and grays . The fifth row held miscellaneous other colors needed for a particular picture . I memorized that row each time . I could feel the lines of my drawing with the tip of the coloring pencil , and learned with practice to avoid running over . Also , I could tell what color had been applied and where . Different colors , because of the pigments they contain , have a different feel . ( Prussian blue , for example , has a harsh , grainy texture almost like sandpaper , while true blue is quite slick . ) Gradually my techniques improved , but I encountered other problems . Often when I would try to choose a subject , nothing with the necessary vividness would occur to me . Or the recollection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , I asked myself , had I been so blind before I was blind ? At times I wanted to cry out to everyone who could still see : " Use your eyes ! Be hungry , be alive , reach out for new experience . Seize upon the beauty around you ; keep it with you in your mind ; never take it for granted ! " As time went on , I devised techniques to restore the intensity of my memories . Every morning when I  | awoke I would lie quietly and command the past to present itself for review . With all my strength , I tried to select and remember images . Thus I brought back the day I stood on top of Lookout Mountain and stared down at the vast tapestry of America , no two fields the same color , no two rivers the same curve . I remembered how a cypress swamp looked in the moonlight , and the white-maned fury of the Atlantic in a northeaster . When I had recaptured enough of a scene , I would try to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it took me about eight or ten hours to sketch a scene , once I had visualized it clearly , and perhaps twice that long to color it . But on some I worked for months . Altogether I have made over 900 drawings , have sold some , and given many away . People came to see what I had done . Former President Truman came and took a picture away with him . One man from New York wanted to buy exclusive rights to all I might produce . These last few years have passed quickly . Dottie and I have a son , a two-year-old so lively and inquisitive that I have to keep my crayons on top of the piano . One day he switched them around , and I wound up with a forest of purple trees ! There are still limitations in my life , of course . Yet it is a good life and I am grateful for it . I 'm not a conventionally religious man , but I ca n't help feeling there was a purpose behind these last six years ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final as at first they seem . They may cause a man to lose heart , lose even the desire to go on . But if he can just hang on , something inside him finally stirs , reaches upward for new life ? and finds it ! @#
