A Story by Katherine Anne Porter Drawing by Henry Markowitz 0 L D Aunt Nannie had a habit of gripping with her knees to hold Miranda while she brushed her hair or buttoned her dress down the back . When Miranda wriggled , Aunt Nannie squeezed still harder , and Miranda wriggled more , but never enough to get away . Aunt Nannie gathered up Miranda 's scalp lock firmly , snapped a rubber band around it , jammed a freshly starched white chambray bonnet over her ears and forehead , fastened the crown to the lock with a large safety pin , and said : " Got to hold you still someways . Here now , do n't you take this off your head till the sun go down . " " / did n't want a bonnet , it 's too hot , I wanted a hat , " said Miranda . " You not goin to get a hat , you goin to get just what you got , " said Aunt Nannie in the bossy voice she used for washing and dressing time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sew this bonnet to your topknot . Your Daddy says if you get freckles he blame me . Now , you 're all ready to set out . " " Where are we going , Aunty ? " Miranda could never find out about anything until the last minute . She was always being surprised . Once she went to sleep in her bed with her kitten curled on the pillow purring , and woke up in a stuffy tight bed in a train , hugging a hot water bottle ; and there was Grandmother stretched out beside her in her McLeod tartan dressing gown , her eyes wide open . Miranda thought something wonderful had happened . " My goodness , Grandmother , where are we going ? " And it was only for another trip to El Paso to see Uncle Bill . Now Tom and Dick were hitched to the carryall standing outside the gate with boxes and baskets tied on everywhere . Grandmother was walking alone through the house very slowly , taking a last look at everything . Now and then she put something else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pretty bulgy . She carried a long black mohair skirt on her other arm , the one she put on over her other skirt when she rode horseback . Her son Harry , Miranda 's father , followed her saying : " I ca n't see the sense in rushing off to Halifax on Five minutes ' notice . " Grandmother said , walking on : " It 's five hours exactly . " Halifax was n't the name of Grandmother 's farm at all , it was Cedar Grove , but Father always called it Halifax . " Hot as Halifax , " he would say when he wanted to describe something very hot . Cedar Grove was very hot , but they went there every summer because Grandmother loved it . " I went to Cedar Grove for fifty summers before you were born , " she told Miranda , who remembered last summer very well , and the summer before a little . Miranda liked it for watermelons and grasshoppers and the long rows of blooming chinaberry trees where the hounds flattened themselves out and slept . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and barked faintly in their sleep , and Uncle jimbilly said it was because dogs always dreamed they were chasing something . In the middle of the day when Miranda looked down over the thick green fields toward the spring she could simply see it being hot : everything blue and sleepy and the mourning doves calling . " Are we going to Halifax , Aunty ? " " Now just ask your Dad if you wanta know so much . " " Are we going to Halifax , Dad ? " Her father twitched her bonnet straight and pulled her hair forward so it would show . " You must n't get sunburned . No , let it alone . Show the pretty curls . You 'll be wading in Whirlypool before supper this evening . " Grandmother said , " Do n't say Halifax , child , say Cedar Grove . Call things by their right names . " " Yes , Ma'am , " said Miranda . Grandmother said again , to her son , " It 's five hours , exactly , and your Aunt Eliza has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take my saddle horse . She 's been there three hours by now . I imagine she 's got the telescope already set up on 56 THE FIG TREE the hen-house roof . I hope nothing happens . " " You worry too much , Mammy , " said her son , trying to conceal his impatience . " I am not worrying , " said Grandmother , shifting her riding skirt to the arm carrying the port-money . " It will scarcely be any good taking this , " she said ; " 1 might in fact as well throw it away for this summer . " " Never mind , Mammy , we 'll send to the Black Farm for Pompey , he 's a good easy saddler . " " You may ride him yourself , " said Grandmother . " I 'll never mount Pompey while Fiddler is alive . Fiddler is my horse , and I hate having his mouth spoilt by a careless rider . Eliza never could ride , and she never will ... " M IR ANDA gave a link skip and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Miranda never got over being surprised at the way grown-up people simply did not seem able to give anyone a straight answer to any question , unless the answer was " No . " Then it popped out with no trouble at all . At a little distance , she heard her Grandmother say , " Harry , have you seen my riding crop lately ? " and her father answered , at least maybe he thought it was an answer , " Now Mammy , for God 's sake let 's get this thing over with . " That was it , exactly . Another strange way her father had of talking was calling Grandmother " Mammy . " Aunt Jane was Mammy . Sometimes he called Grandmother " Mama , " but she was n't Mama either , she was really Grandmother . Mama was dead . Dead meant gone away forever . Dying was something that happened all the time , to people and everything else . Somebody died , and there was a long string of carriages going at a slow walk over the rocky ridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tolled , and that person was never seen again by anybody . Kittens and chickens and specially little turkeys died much oftener , and sometimes calves , but hardly ever cows or horses . Lizards on rocks turned into shells , with no lizard inside at all . If caterpillars all curled up and furry did n't move when you poked them with a stick , that meant they were dead  --  it was a sure sign . When Miranda found any creature that did n't move or make a noise , or looked somehow different from the live ones , she always buried it in a little grave with flowers on top and a smooth stone at the head . Even grasshoppers . Everything dead had to be treated this way . " This way and no other ! " Grandmother always said when she was laying down the law about all kinds of things . " It must be done this way , and no other ! " Miranda went down the crooked flat-stone walk hopping zigzag between the grass tufts . First there were pomegranate and cape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shady and that was the fig grove . She went to her favorite fig tree where the deep branches bowed down level with her chin , and she could gather figs without having to climb and skin her knees . Grandmother had n't remembered to take any figs to the country the last time , she said there were plenty of them at Cedar Grove . But the ones at Cedar Grove were big soft greenish white ones , and these at home were black and sugary . It was strange that Grandmother did not seem to notice the difference . The air was sweet among the fig trees , and chickens were always getting out of the run and rushing there to eat the figs off the ground . One mother hen was scurrying around scratching and clucking . She would scratch around a fig lying there in plain sight and cluck to her children as if it was a worm and she had dug it up for them . " Old smarty , " said Miranda , " you 're just pretending . " When the little chickens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one little chicken did not move . He was spread out on his side with his eyes shut and his mouth open . He was yellow fur in spots and pin feathers in spots , and the rest of him was naked and sunburned . " Lazy , " said Miranda , poking him with her toe . Then she saw that he was dead . Oh and in no time at all they 'd be setting out for Halifax . Grandmother never went away , she always set out for somewhere . She 'd have to hurry like anything to get him buried properly . Back into the house she went on tiptoe hoping not to be seen , for Grandmother always asked : " Where are you going , child ? What are you doing ? What is that you 're carrying ? Where did you get it ? Who gave you permission ? " and after Miranda had explained all that , even if there turned out not to be anything wrong in it , nothing ever seemed so nice any more . Besides it took forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , third Katherine Anne Porter , one of America 's most distinguished storytellers , wrote " The Fig Tree " in Paris in 1934 .

" A STORY BY KATHERINE ANNE PORTER 57 down , left-hand side where her new shoes were still wrapped in tissue paper in a nice white box the right size for a chicken with pinfeathers . She pushed the rustling white folded things and the lavender bags out of the way and trembled a little . Down in front the carry-all wheels screeched and crunched on the gravel , with Old Uncle Jimbilly yelling like a foghorn , " Hiyi , thar , back up , you steeds ! Back up than , you ! " and of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they would be pointing toward Halifax . They 'd be after her , calling and hurrying her and she would n't have time for anything and they would n't listen to a word . I T WAS N'T hard work digging a hole with her little spade in the loose dry soil . Miranda wrapped the slimpsy chicken in tissue paper , trying to make it look pretty , laid it in the box carefully , and covered it up with a nice mound , just like peoples ' . She had hardly got it piled up grave shape , kneeling and leaning to smooth it over , when a strange sound came from somewhere , a very sad little crying sound . It said Weep , weep , weep , three times like that slowly , and it seemed to come from the mound of dirt . " My goodness , " Miranda asked herself aloud , " what 's that ? " She pushed her bonnet off her ears and listened hard . " Weep , weep , " said the tiny sad voice . And People began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She began to clamor , too . " Yes , Aunty , wait a minute , Aunty ! " " You come right on here this minute , we 're goinI " " You have to wait , Aunty ! " Her father was coming along the edge of the fig trees . " Hurry up , Baby , you 'll get left ! " Miranda felt she could n't bear to be left . She ran all shaking with fright . Her father gave her the annoyed look he always gave her when he said something to upset her and then saw that she was upset . His words were kind but his voice scolded : " Stop getting so excited , Baby , you know we would n't leave you for anything . " Miranda wanted to talk back : " Then why did you say so ? " but she was still listening for that tiny sound : " Weep , weep . " She lagged and pulled backward , looking over her shoulder , but her fa/her hurried her toward the carry-all . But things did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was one of the signs . Oh , but she had heard it . Her father sat in front and drove , and old Uncle Jimbilly did n't do anything but get down and open gates . Grandmother and Aunt Nannie sat in the back seat , with Miranda between them . She loved setting out somewhere , with everybody smiling and settling down and looking up at the weather , with the horses bouncing and pulling on the reins , the springs jolting and swaying with a creaky noise that made you feel sure you were traveling . That evening she would go wading with Maria and Paul and Uncle Jimbilly , and that very night she would lie nut on the grass in her nightgown to cool off , and they would all drink lemonade before going to bed . Sister Maria and Brother Paul would already be burnt like muffins because they were sent on ahead the minute school was out . Sister Maria had got freckled and Father was furious . " Keep your bonnet on , " he said to Miranda , sternly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that face ruined , too . " But oh , what had made that funny sound ? Miranda 's ears buzzed and she had a dull round pain in her just under her front rihs . She had to go back and let him out . He 'd never get out by himself , all tangled up in tissue paper and that shoebox . He 'd never get out without her . " Grandmother , I 've got to go back . Oh , I 've got got to go back ! " Grandmother turned Miranda 's face around by the chin and looked at her closely , the way grown folks did . Grandmother 's eyes were always the same . They never looked kind or sad or angry or tired or anything . They just looked , blue and still . " What is the matter with you , Miranda , what happened ? " " Oh , I 've got to go back  --  I forg-got something important . " " Stop that silly crying and tell me what you want . " Miranda could n't stop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Baby 's sick . " He reached out his handkerchief to her face . " What 's the matter with my honey ? Did you eat something ? " Miranda had to stand up to cry as hard as she wanted to . The wheels went grinding round in the road , the carry-all wobbled so that Grandmother had to take her by one arm , and her father by the other . They stared at each other over Miranda 's head with a moveless gaze that Miranda had seen often , and their eyes looked exactly alike . Miranda blinked up at them , waiting to see who would win . Then Grandmother 's hand fell away , and Miranda was banded over to her father . He gave the reins to Uncle Jimbilly , and lifted her over the top of the scat . She sprawled against his chest and knees as if he were an armchair and stopped crying at once . " We ca n't go back just for notions , " he told her in the reasoning tone he always talked in when Grandmother scolded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , blow hard . What did you forget , Honey ? We 'll find another . Was it your doll ? " Miranda hated dolls . She never played with them . She always pulled the wigs off and tied them on the kittens , like hats . The kittens pulled them off instantly . It was fun . She put the doll clothes on the kittens and it took any one of them just half a minute to get them all off again . Kittens had sense . Miranda wailed suddenly , " Oh , I want my doll ! " and cried again , trying to drown out the strange little sound , " Weep weep " " Well now , if that 's all , " said her father comfortably , " there 's a raft of dolls at Cedar Grove , and about forty fresh kittens . How 'd you like that ? " " Forty ? " asked Miranda . " About , " said Father . Old Aunt Nannie leaned and held out her hand . " Look honey , I toted you some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black and it looked like a fig upside down with a white ruffled cap . Miranda clenched her eyes tight and shook her head . " Is that a pretty way to behave when Aunt Nannie offers you something nice ? " asked Grandmother in her gentle reminding tone of voice . " No , Ma'am , " said Miranda meekly . " Thank you , Aunt Nannie . " But she did not accept the figs . G REAT-AUNT ELIZA , halfway upa stepladder pitched against the flat-roofed chicken house , was telling Hinry just how to set up her telescope . " For a fellow who never saw or heard of a telescope , " Great-Aunt Eliza said to Grandmother , who was really her sister Sophia Jane , " he does n't do so badly so long as I tell him . " " I do wish you 'd stop clambering up stepladders , Eliza , " said Grandmother , " at your time of life . " " You 're nothing but a nervous wreck , Sophia , I declare . When did you ever know me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Grandmother tardy , " there is such a thing as appropriate behavior at your time of ? " Great-Aunt Eliza seized a fold of her heavy brown pleated skirt with one hand , with the other she grasped the ladder one rung higher and ascended another step . " Now Hinry , " she called , " just swing it around facing west and leave itlevel . I 'll fix it the way I want when I 'm ready . You can come on down now . " She came down then herself , and said to her sister : " So long as you can go bouncing off on that horse of yours , Sophia Jane , I s'pose I can climb ladders . I 'm three years younger than you , and at your time of life that makes all the difference ! " Grandmother turned pink as the inside of a sea shell . the one on her sewing table that had the sound of the sea in it ; Miranda knew that she had always been the pretty one , and she was pretty still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been . Miranda . watching and listening  --  for everything in the world was strange to her and something she had to know about  --  saw two old women , who were proud of being grandmothers , who spoke to children always as if they knew best about everything and children knew nothing , and they told children all clay long to come here , go there , do this , do not do that , and they were always right and children never were except when they did anything they were told right away without a word . And here they were bickering like two little girls at school , or even the way Miranda and her sister Maria bickered and nagged and picked on each other and said things on purpose to hurt each other 's feelings . Miranda felt sad and strange and a little frightened . She began edging away . " Where are you going , Miranda ? " asked Grandmother in her everyday voice . " Just to the house , " said Miranda , her heart sinking . " Wait and walk with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale and had white hair . Beside her , Great-Aunt Eliza loomed like a mountain with her grizzled iron-colored hair like a curly wig , her steel-rimmed spectacles over her snuff-colored eyes , and snuff-colored woolen skirts billowing about her , and her smell of snuff . When she came through the door she quite filled it up . When she sat down the chair disappeared under her , and she seemed to be sitting solidly on herself from her waistband to the floor . Now with Grandmother sitting across the room rummaging in her work basket and pretending not to see anything , Great-Aunt Eliza took a small brown bottle out of her pocket , opened it , took a pinch of snuff in each nostril , sneezed loudly , wiped her nose with a big white starchy-looking handkerchief , pushed her spectacles up on her forehead , took a little twig chewed into a brush at one end , dipped and twisted it around in the little bottle , and placed it firmly between her teeth . Miranda had heard of this shameful habit in women of the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' dip snuff , " and surely not in the family . Yet here was Great-Aunt Eliza , a lady even if not a very pretty one , clipping snuff . Miranda knew how her grandmother felt about it ; she stared fascinated at Great-Aunt Eliza until her eyes watered . Great-Aunt Eliza stared back in turn . " Look here , young one , d'ye s'pose if I gave you a gumdrop you 'd get out from under foot ? " She reached in the other pocket and took out a roundish rather crushed looking pink gumdrop with the sugar coating pretty badly crackled . " Now take this , and do n't let me lay eyes on you any more today . " I RAND A hurried away , clenching the gumdrop in her palm . When she reached the kitchen it was oozing through her fingers . She went to the faucet and held her hand under the water and tried to wash off the snuffy smell . After this crime she did not really dare go near Great-Aunt Eliza again soon . " What did you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could almost hear her asking . Yet Miranda almost forgot her usual interests , such as kittens and other little animals on the place , pigs , chickens , rabbits , anything at all so it was a baby and would let her pet and feed it , for Great-Aunt Eliza 's ways and habits kept Miranda following her about , gazing , or sitting across the dining table , gazing , for when Great-Aunt Eliza was not on the roof before her telescope , always just before daylight or just after dark , she was walking about with a microscope and a burning glass , peering closely at something she saw on a tree trunk , something she found in the grass ; now and then she collected fragments that looked like dried leaves or bits of bark , brought them in the house , spread them out on a sheet of white paper , and sat there , poring , as still as if she were saying her prayers . At table she would dissect a scrap of potato peeling or anything else she might be eating , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " from time to time . Grandmother , who did not allow the children to bring anything to the table to play with and who forbade them to do anything but eat while they were there , ignored her sister 's manners as long as she could , then remarked one day , when Great-Aunt Eliza was humming like a bee to herself over what her microscope had found in a raisin , " Eliza , if it is interesting save it for me to look at after dinner . Or tell me what it is . " " You would n't know if I told you , " said Great-Aunt Eliza , coolly , putting her microscope away and finishing off her pudding . When at last , just before they were all going back to town again , Great-Aunt Eliza invited the children to climb the ladder with her and see the stars through her telescope . They were so awed they looked at each other like strangers , and did not exchange a word . Miranda saw only a great pale flaring disk of cold light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pure rapture , " Oh , it 's like another world ! " " Why of course , child , " said Great-Aunt Eliza , in her growling voice , but kindly , " other worlds , a million other worlds . " " Like this one ? " asked Miranda , timidly . " Nobody knows , child . . . " " Nobody knows , nobody knows , " Miranda sang to a tune in her head , and when the others walked on , she was so dazzled with joy she fell back by herself , walking a little distance behind Great-Aunt Eliza 's swinging lantern and her wide-swinging skirts . They took the dewy path through the fig grove , much like the one in town , with the early dew bringing out the sweet smell of the milky leaves . They passed a fig tree with low hanging branches , and Miranda reached up by habit and touched it with her fingers for luck . From the earth beneath her feet came a terrible , faint troubled sound . " Weep weep , weep weep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smothering earth , the grave . Miranda bounded like a startled pony against the back of Great-Aunt Eliza 's knees , crying out " Oh , oh , oh , wait .. . " " What on earth 's the matter , child ? " Miranda seized the warm snuffy hand held out to her and hung on hard . " Oh , there 's something saying ' weep weep ' out of the ground ! " Great-Aunt Eliza stooped , put her arm mound Miranda and listened carefully , fora moment . " Hear them ? " she said . " They 're not in the ground at all . They arc the first tree frogs , means it 's going to rain , " she said , " weep weep  --  hear them ? " Miranda took a deep trembling breath and heard them . They were in the trees . They walked on again , Miranda holding Great-Aunt Eliza 's hand . " Just think , " said Great-Aunt Eliza , in her most scientific voice , " when tree frogs shed their skins , they pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they eat them . Can you imagine ? They have the prettiest little shapes you saw  --  I 'll show you one sometime under microscope . " " Thank you , Ma'am , " Miranda remembered finally to say through her fog of bliss at hearing the tree frogs sing , " ' Weep weep . . . " FInvher " ... 54n Ref .1 , 11 , ei
