A man 's hands can tell a lot about him-the kind of work he does , his attention to personal cleanliness , the extent of his vanity . Now , in the opinion of some modern cardiologists , the hand is a valuable clue not only to a man 's occupation and habits , but also , in many cases , to the condition of his heart . <P> Dr. Mark E. Silverman and Dr. J. Willis Hurst of Atlanta 's Emory University School of Medicine presented their latest hand-and-heart findings to the American College of Cardiology last week . Although the cause and nature of a heart defect or disorder are often obscure , the doctors suggested that these may become apparent to " the cardiovascular sleuth who lingers a moment longer at the radial ( wrist ) pulse to inspect the hand closely . " <P> Simian Crease . Countless babies are born with genetic heart defects and in many of these cases the genetic defect has visible , external effects as well as internal ones . The most obvious example : mongolism , technically known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart defects along with abnormalities of the hands-flabbiness , thickness , a short fifth finger and a " simian crease " across the palm . Several other genetic , chromosomally determined defects have comparable telltale hand signs . <P> More surprising was Dr. Silverman 's report that heart disease acquired relatively late in life-including coronary occlusion-may be signaled by changes in the hand . Warm , moist hands with a fine tremor and occasionally clubbing* of the fingers , he said , suggest the possibility of an overactive thyroid with resulting inefficiency of the heart , and twitching of its upper chambers . A cold hand with coarse , puffy skin may be due to an underactive thyroid , and associated with fluid in the heart sac , a high blood-level of cholesterol , and even necrosis of part of the heart muscle from a coronary occlusion . <P> And Cancer Too . The clenched fist of a patient describing his chest pain is a vivid illustration of the discomfort at the time of an occlusion . About two weeks after an otherwise undetected occlusion , the patient may have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shiny , discolored and stiff . The stiffness comes from thickening of the fibrous layer just below the skin down the middle of the palm . It may pull the fingers together and sometimes also downward . Skin thickening and stiffness of this type may be the signs of a previous and hitherto-undetected coronary occlusion . <P> Even lung disease , including cancer , may be reflected in the hands , said Dr. Silverman . Emphysema , the currently common disease marked by inadequate oxygen intake at the lungs ' surface , may produce clubbing of the fingers . The type of cancer that occurs most commonly in long-term male cigarette smokers may eventually lead to acutely painful clubbing of the fingers and equally painful enlargement of the toe joints . <P> Typical of rheumatoid arthritis , which may have several adverse effects upon the heart , said Silverman , is an outward turning of the fingers ( with the hand viewed palm-down ) , along with thickening of the finger joints . In many hard-to-diagnose cases of heart disease , say the Atlanta doctors , the skilled physician 's careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stethoscope and even the electrocardiograph do not disclose . <P> * Thickening of the fingertip tissue .
