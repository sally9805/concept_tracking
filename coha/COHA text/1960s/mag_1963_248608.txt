Businessmen who live high on the hog irritate a Brazilian intellectual named Israel Klabin . " In an underdeveloped country , " says Klabin , " there can be no elite . " Yet Klabin himself , a businessman as well as a Sorbonne graduate , belongs to-and prizes membership in - an elite of sorts . At 36 , he is one of Brazil 's brightest young businessmen and the primus inter pares of an unusual family whose members share equally the profits and responsibilities of running a $130 million business complex . " We are , " says Israel Klabin , " something like the Rothschilds . " <P> <P> The ten brothers , sisters , cousins and nephews who are at the center of the dynastic Klabin clan completely own a group of ten companies that mine minerals , raise cattle , grow coffee and manufacture paper , tiles and textiles . They have just completed a $30 million plant expansion that will more than double their newsprint capacity to 135,000 tons , reduce Brazil 's paper imports by a third . Hoping to further Brazil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build two new plants to make paper and tile as soon as Brazil 's runaway inflation slows down a bit . <P> <P> Modest Living . Like many of Brazil 's industrial big rich , the Klabins are relative newcomers who have benefited from the country 's expanding markets , its hunger for European skills and its easy tolerance of immigrants . Four of them left Latvia for Brazil near the turn of the century and opened a plant to convert rags into paper . Gradually , the family founded or acquired other companies , and at the start of World War II were asked to build a huge paper mill by Dictator Getulio Vargas , who feared that the war would cut off Brazil 's paper imports . When the Klabins objected that a U.S. gearing for war would not export machinery for the plant , Vargas telephoned Franklin Roosevelt and got the Klabins what they wanted . <P> <P> The Klabins have built up their vast enterprises with equal measures of fierce family loyalty , business acumen , political sagacity and social awareness . They lived modestly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in new plants and won political favor by acquiring a reputation for public service . A grandson of an original Klabin , Horacio Lafer , 63 , who is an active partner in the Klabin business enterprises today , has served as Brazil 's Foreign Minister and Finance Minister , and amazed everyone in 1951 by balancing Brazil 's budget . <P> Good Night &; Goodbye . The Klabins ' no-nonsense tradition is carried on by Israel Klabin , who considers himself " a troubleshooter and a father confessor " for his family 's business . Last year , despite Brazil 's eroding currency , the business grossed well over $60 million . As to which of the many branches is the most profitable , that is a secret the family holds tightly . " I always remember what my father told me about Baron Rothschild , " says Israel Klabin . " When he was dying , Rothschild called in his sons and said : ' I have only two things to tell you . Never show your books , and good night and goodbye . ' '   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
