txt Charles Iannello , who this month began a one-year sentence for larceny in the House of Correction here , plans to run for the Massachusetts House of Representatives next month . Even though he would n't be around for much of next year 's legislative session unless paroled , local political analysts pick the 56-year-old Boston Democrat as a favorite to defeat primary opposition and go on to beat his Republican rival in November 's general election . The fact that he hails from a heavily Democratic district will simplify his task if , as expected , he reaches the final vote , and in both contests Mr. Iannello will have experience working in his favor . He served in the Massachusetts legislature from 1951 until his resignation this summer following his conviction . Mr. Iannello was charged with larceny when a construction firm he was associated with was found to have accepted state payments for work never performed . Mr. Iannello also has precedent on his side : in years past a number of Massachusetts politicians have remained in public life despite scrapes with the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison on a Federal mail fraud charge in 19.17 . He was mayor of Boston at the time and , upon release , he finished his term of office which had more than two years to run . According to the New England Citizens Crime Commission , at least eight current members of the Massachusetts legislature have criminal records . And Mr. Iannello himself was under indictment on the larceny charges when he was elected to his most recent term in the legislature in 1960 . Widespread Corruption The spectacle of a state legislator convicted of bilking the public treasury coolly making plans to run for office again , in the view of many observers of the Bay State scene , says a great deal about the level of political morality here . They contend it suggests corruption so widespread that some politicians do n't deem getting caught In the act any particular handicap to their careers . And it suggests that a sizable segment of the population , whether through inertia or dulled moral sensibilities . goes along with this casual attitude toward official wrongdoing . Massachusetts , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in payoffs. kickbacks . and other shady practices . Nor does anyone ' Imply that all politicians and govern . ment employes here are crooked : no one questions . for example . the probity of Republican Gov . John Volpe or Mayor John Collins of Boston , a Democrat . All the same , many people familiar with Massachusetts ' politics , believe the corruption found at every level of government here Is matched in few other areas . Rep. William C. Cramer of Florida . ranking Republican on the House public works subcommittee , which has been investigating fraud by state employes in the handling of Federal highway funds in Massachusetts and other states , maintains that corruption here is among the worst in the country . The president of a Massachusetts heavy construction company says his firm stopped bidding on state jobs because so many politicians had their hands out . " The iceberg analogy is the proper one for graft In Massachusetts . " he comments . " Though a tremendous amount of corruption has been uncovered , most of it is still hidden . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so ingrained and extensive here , students of political science say Massachusetts serves as an object lesson on the ways dishonest men in government can boost the costs of doing business , pad tax bills and impair the quality of government services . Thus , its troubles take on significance for citizens of other states , none of which are immune from similar epidemics of graft and self-dealing in government , if they let their guards down . The sizable amount of Federal funds channeled through Massachusetts agencies also adds to the national intporta nee of ** here : of the $670 million the state spent last year , almost $100 million came from Washington . Misuse of Federal highway money . in fact . has already produced a major scandal in Massachusetts . The dubious highway dealines came to light in 1961. when the U.S. was pou ? - ing S46 million into the state for road building . Under the Federal highway program , states are reimbursed by Washington for land they purchased for highways in the interstate system . In Massachusetts , state Department of Public Works employes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land valuations so that extra money could be collected from Uncle Sam . Some Federal officials estimate overpayments total in the millions . A typical charge : An owner willing to sell for $30,000 was persuaded to accept $60,000 . The understanding was that the extra $30,000 would he split up among the owner , the appraiser and Public Works employes . So far , ti men have been indicted for fraud in the land transactions . High Taxes While a scheme such as this affects all I7.S. taxpayers . the burden of corruption naturally falls most heavily on Massachusetts residents and on businesses operating in the stale . State and local taxei : in Massachusetts annually amount to $230 per person , sixth highest in the nation , and there 's little doubt that official corruption helps raise the total In the Bay State . Charging the state far services never rendered , after the fashion of the construction firm with which Mr. lannello was affiliated , is one of the ways men in government and their business friends clip into the public till and contribute to higher government costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state managed to recoup its loss . Marinueci Bros. b . Co. , a Boston-based construction company . recently returned $212.282 to the Department of Public Works in settlement of a court case . The firm had been indicted by a grand jury on charges of accepting payment for removal of soft peat from a highway right of way and replacing it with solid fill  - -  both of which tasks it had neglected to perform , according to the state . Though no government employes were indicted , its widely believed there must have been some collusion between the company and Public Works staff members . A Well-Maintained Car A former state official recalls how one of his subordinates and a firm which maintained state cars conspired to overcharge the state and split the profit . " During one cheek . " says the official . " we found vouchers and receipts for rotating the tires and repacking the wheel bearings on , one state car 10 times during a single month . " What could turn out to he one of the biggest fraudulent payments yet in the Bay State is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . The case involves questionable goingson in the construction of a $9.6 million park . ing garage under Boston Common by the Massachusetts Parking Authority , a quasi-public : agency . Allegedly , about $1 million of the cost went to a dummy consulting engineering firm which did no work . A former chairman of the authority , the vice chairman , the general manager of the garage and a consulting engineer are among those indicted . In some cases , graft . while not increasing government costs . may result in taxpayers ' getting less than their money 's worth . A prominent Boston architect claims it 's not at all Unusual here for architects and engineers to be required to hand over as much as a third of their fees to politicians and their associates as a prerequisite for obtaining school design jobs . The architects and engineers ca n't very well pad charges to make up for the kickbacks . since their fees are a fixed percentage of the cost of the project . Thus . asserts the Boston a , - ebitect , to trol:e a nrof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hastily . This inevitably leads to some shoddy jobs , he says . Architects and engineers are by no means the only prey of politicians and government employes on the take . Massachusetts businessmen  - -  especially proprietors of small firms -- complain they frequently must pay off local government employes . In passing out what sometimes are outright bribes , the businessmen are not without guilt themselves . But most contend that the system forces them to make payoffs or see their businesses suffer . Payoffs to Police Payoffs to police are commonplace , claim many businessmen . A Boston dealer in used and antique furniture says he Is visited " two or three times a year by a couple of detectives who expect about $25 each time . " In exchange . explains the dealer , the detectives do n't enforce a burdensome old law requiring all sales of used items to be listed and reported to the police . Many contractors assert local building inspectors routinely demand payoffs in return for approval of construction work . " In most of the larger towns in Massachusetts inspectors can tie you up for weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contractor . " I find it cheaper to slip the Inspector a few dollars than to pay a four or five man crew for doing nothing . " The contractor gives this account of a recent payoff : " I just did a job in Cambridge which called for the installation of a new toilet . We wanted to use copper pipe because it 's easier to bend for a neat job . But the inspector said we had to use iron pipe and that he could n't pass the job unless we did . Then he said . ' Why do n't you do this the easy way ? ' He walked out into the yard , I followed and we chatted about this and that for awhile . Finally I gave him S25. and he signed a card okaying the job with copper pipe . " " Appreciation Dinners " A tribal custom in Massachusetts politics which is not illegal but which costs businessmen money is the " appreciation dinner . " These affairs are staged regularly for legislators and public officials , and businesses are expected to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign funds , its generally accepted that a substantial portion of the money from ticket sales goes directly into politicians ' pockets . Pointing up the popularity of " appreciation dinners " in Massachusetts political circles , a lobbyist for a Bay State company opens his desk drawer and displays a year 's accumulation of dinner solicitations a stack six inches high . " Every one of those is from someone trying to put the bite on its to buy a batch of tickets to a dinner for some politician , " says the lobbyist . The ticket prices range from $5 to $100 , and sonic of the letters contain as many as 25 tickets . " It would cost my company thousands of dollars a year r If I bought every ticket . " observes the tobbvist . Another charge leveled against Massachusetts officials and legislators is that they frequently cut themselves in on the profits from insurance and performance bonds which must be purchased by contractors performing public works jobs . Sometimes , it 's charged , such business goes directly to insurance firms in which politicians have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that more than 70 of the 280 representatives and senators in the state legislature are insurance men . In other instances , politicians may guide business to friends in the insurance field and then take a share of the fees . Massachusetts politicians dominate this insurance and bonding business by a very simple expedient . They have the public agency awarding a public works contract designate the insurance broker with whom the contraeting , firm must deal . " To get almost any kind of public works contract in this state a contractor has to place his performance bond and insurance with a broker designated by the awarding authority . " confirms an official of a large insurance brokerage concern . " The cute boys in politics say no one is getting hurt because the fees have to be paid to somebody , " comments Allan E. Gifford , a former Republican state legislator who is now an insurance attorney . " The ' companies who pay say they do n't care - who it goes to . But it opens the path to obligations , fee splitting and favoritism. "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
