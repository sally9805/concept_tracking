He filed a petition for admission to the New York State bar only last Friday . His name is not yet on the office door , because not until next Jan. 1 will he become a full partner in the Manhattan firm of Mudge , Stern , Baldwin &; Todd . His secretarial staff numbers just two , and spends much of its time turning down invitations for the boss to make public appearances . Yet for all his insistence that he has no immediate plans for a return to national office , Richard Nixon suddenly seems to be the Republican whom everybody is talking about for his party 's 1964 presidential nomination . <P> Journalists have always taken particular satisfaction in speculating about Nixon-and most of the current Nixon talk is journalistic speculation . But it got some extra impetus through an offhand remark by the senior Republican who , according to those same journalists , for so long wanted to " dump Nixon . " Dwight Eisenhower , in a televised interview , spoke of Nixon 's chances in the event of a G.O.P. convention stalemate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those deadlocks , I would think he would be one of the likely persons to be examined and approached , because he is , after all , a very knowledgeable and a very courageous type of fellow . " <P> " Thing of the Past . " Many press accounts managed to read into Ike 's observation an endorsement of Nixon for next year 's nomination . It was , of course , a mere political truism-and no one knew it better than Nixon himself . To be sure , he said , if there was a Republican deadlock , his name would come up . But , he insisted , in practical political terms , " deadlocks are a thing of the past . " <P> Nixon had some very specific ideas about the part he should play in party affairs . Said he : " My role as I see it is to be a spokesman on great issues where I have something important to say and experience-and also to stay out of the fight within the Republican Party , which must go on until the nomination , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco . " <P> Referring to the rivalry between Barry Goldwater and Nelson Rockefeller , Nixon continued : " It 's a rugged fight . This is not unusual . We already have seen bloodletting . There 'll be some more blood spilled before it 's over . In 1960 President Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson said things far worse about each other than what has been said to this point , and they got together . <P> " I want to see the Republicans have their arguments , but settle them without burning their bridges behind them . " <P> " Who 's Letting Blood ? " One Republican who seemed to see a declaration of war in Nixon 's " bloodletting " remark was Goldwater . He called it " one of the most unfortunate statements that has been made lately . " Cried he : " It 's this type of thing that tends to tear the party apart . Who 's letting blood ? It certainly is n't me . And I 'm not going to be the one who lets blood . One of my chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have been convinced that Nixon meant it when he said repeatedly he had no designs on the nomination , but I have to discount that now . It 's obvious as the day is long that something 's on the move with Mr. Nixon . "
