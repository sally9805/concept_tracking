TRACK &; FIELD <P> The long jump has been the exclusive bag of two men for so long that the event could have been called " The Ralph &; Igor Show . " Between them since 1960 , the U.S. 's Ralph Boston , 28 , and Russia 's Igor Ter-Ovanesyan , 29 , have broken and rebroken the world indoor and outdoor records eleven times , won four Olympic medals and dominated every meet they entered . So imagine the impertinence when a slender , 21-year-old sophomore from the University of Texas at El Paso swiped all the action from his elders . <P> Eight times so far this season , Bob Beamon has jumped against Boston , and beaten him every time . Ter-Ovanesyan has been sitting it out back home . Two months ago in Kansas City , Beamon sailed 27 ft. 1 in. to break the world indoor mark of 27 ft. set by the Russian in 1966 . Two weeks ago , at the N.C.A.A. championships in Detroit , Beamon rubbed salt in the wound with a leap of 27 ft. 2 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it , really . " I just jump , " he says . Sprinting down the runway , he powers off the board , " windmilling " through the air until the last instant , when he extends his legs way out ahead of him-and sometimes plops right back down on his fanny , spoiling the jump . But most often Beamon defies gravity and thrusts himself forward . No one can explain quite how . Nor do track buffs understand much else that Beamon does . A 9.5-sec. sprinter in the 100 , he races through his approach at a speed generally considered too tiring for an all-out jump . And Beamon is still deciding how far to run before takeoff : he usually favors a run of 134 ft , but both his world records came off runs of 114 ft . Moreover , he can not be bothered counting strides or placing checkpoints along the runway with the result that while he prefers to take off from his right foot , he sometimes reaches the board with his left . <P> Love That Basketball . Son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrating on the long jump . True , he could jump better than 24 ft. when only a freshman at Jamaica High School in New York , but basketball was his love , he says . " I did n't have too much interest in track . " All that changed at Texas when Coach Wayne Vandenburg got hold of him . As a freshman at the A.A.U. championships in Oakland last March , Beamon fouled on three of his four jumps . His one legal jump , though , was a full 15 in. better than he had ever done before-26 ft. 11 in. , good enough for a new American indoor record . <P> Now that he has the world indoor record , Beamon has his sights on the outdoor record of 27 ft. 4 in. , held jointly by Boston and Ter-Ovanesyan . And why not ? After all , Bob got off a fantastic 27-ft. 7-in. jump at the N.C.A.A. championships , only to find that he had fouled by in . Ultimately , he aims for a 28-ft. jump-the distance it may take to win in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , " says he . " I have n't really started my training . "
