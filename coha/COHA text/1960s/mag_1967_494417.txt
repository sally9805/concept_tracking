THE NEW REPUBLIC When the aristrocrats fled St. Petersburg at the outbreak of the Revolution , some of the English nannies and governessess in their employ stayed on . They were not , as need hardly be said , in favor of the rising . On the con-trary , they thought it all very unnecessary and a great mistake . Now and again they wended their way through the seething mobs to the Bolshevist HQ and lodged complaints of the shocking amount of noise at night ; but As the toll mounts , their teacher is forced to ask himself whether he did his children a favor by teaching them to write and think , whether it was good to create expectations that the schools did not live up to . His answer is troubled . He will not teach again in the public school system as it stands . He hopes he can find a way to continue teaching children , but it is clear that he will be less certain that he can save them next time . What he will be able to do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the burden of being alive in the United States today . " 36 Children presents an aspect of the social tragedy now engulfing this country , but it is much more than simply another book with the same message we have heard and ignored often before . Each child has signed his teacher 's memory with a characteristic kind of wit , a way of talking or writing , a special bravado . The book is tragic , but it is its triumph to demonstrate the stubborn individuality of these children , who , with their intelligence and their promise are so much bigger than the small , mean fates stalking them . In Harlem iron traps are set and waiting for the young flesh , but there is gaiety in their lives , and there are gestures of deep courtesy , too , and these are also part of the rich , increasingly bitter truth 36 Children tells us . The - British Remnant by Honor Tracy on the whole they ignored the matter . Nonetheless , they did not propose to leave merely because a bunch of excitable foreigners were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and at their own convenience . Whether it is the nannies of St. Petersburg or the dwellers by the Amazon , with their stone-age customs and their preference for Mozart to the Beatles , human beings who go their own way regardless are always engaging . In this beautifully written book Miss Panter-Downes describes with gentle humor a notable group of the category , namely , the remnant British of Ootacamund . Ooty as the Sahibs inevitably called her ? is set in the Nilgiris or Blue Hills of southern India , seven thousand feet above the furnace heat of Mysore and Madras . She describes herself , with quiet assurance , as the " Queen of Hill Stations . " No Viceroy held his summer court there , no Kipling ever wrote her up , hundreds to whom Simla was a household name never heard of her , yet she never lacked discriminating admirers . The scenery on the way up to the pass reminded Macaulay of Windsor forest or Cumberland , while the then Bishop of Calcutta compared her to Malvern at the height of its season : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approval , and so was the Governor of Madras when he wrote of the " numberless green knolls ... smooth as the lawns in an English park . " Lord Lytton paid a short visit during the rains and was even more delighted ? " such delicious English rain , such delicious English mud " ? and a Victorian lady found to her rapture that she had a real chilblain . Their day , with all the prestige , the brilliance , the routs , the balls , is done forever . The faithful few are apt to be tweedy , suburban , hard-up and , as the author delicately puts it , with the accent on maturity . " She 's only seventy , you know , " a woman remarks to a friend , waiting while the grocer parcels up their chocolate biscuits , lime juice , marmalade . " Yes , " comes the reply , " I remember her mother . " Every year , just for April and May , things are almost what they were . Then the swells of the Nilgiris and even further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Flower Show and Dog Show , the latter of which , it seems , arouses the same formidable passion as at home . After that Ooty settles down once more as a developing Indian town . Yet there are countless monuments and relics of the English , prone as always to reconstitute an England round them wherever they go . The once famous Ooty Hunt survives , though gravely depleted . So does the Ooty Club , whose bar is decorated with mounted snarling heads of the hill jackals with which , in the absence of foxes , the Hunt must needs make do , and where three afternoons a week the same four ladies meet regularly for Bridge . There is a British cemetery , where subalterns of twenty odd lie with small children , victims of cholera or climate : now and then the ghost of an English lady putters happily and inoffensively about the garden that used to be hers . The author brings out the Indian attitude delightfully . Few , she says , regret the British apart from such as made money out of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire to obliterate all trace of the Raj or in any way to harass the pocketful of survivors . They join the Hunt and heap coals of fire by admitting Europeans to membership of their Clubs . They look with tolerant unconcern on the rich assortment of eccentrics that flourish in the heady mountain air , even to the lady who wears men 's socks , garters and brogues with her cotton frocks . No one dreams of blowing up the scarlet pillar-boxes with Queen Victoria 's initial and coat of arms . The Indian owners of formerly English houses are willing , in fact disposed , to leave them with the name of Apple Cottage or Woodcock Hall . THE NEW REPUBLIC People have said of India , that maddening as it often is , having once lived there they could not live happily anywhere else . Perhaps that is why this bizarre little colony hangs on year after year , its numbers gradually shrinking by death rather than defection . And yet it hardly seems in touch with Indian life at all . Retired colonels , widows , sturdy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breed dogs , adopt starving mongrels or sick ponies , grow delphiniums and violets , chat about the past , borrow books from the library , support the Culture Centre and attend St. Stephen 's Protestant church on Sunday , for all the world as if they were in Midhurst or Cheltenham . They have even managed to create the atmosphere of the British Sabbath , the author tells us : on that holy day a kind of flatness and deadness prevails in the very streets . Warned that a panther or hyena is prowling the neighborhood , their only reaction is to keep their pets safe indoors . It is impossible , however , by mere description to convey the quality of this little jewel of a book . Miss PanterDownes has long been known for her admirable London Letters in The New Yorker ; but even her most devoted fans will hardly be prepared for observation so exact , feeling so warm and humor so subtle . Little turns of phrase here and there suggest that she is herself an American and , if so , it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But whatever it was , Miss panter-Downes and the Queen of Hill Stations were made for each other .
