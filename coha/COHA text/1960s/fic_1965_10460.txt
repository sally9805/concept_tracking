would be pretty hard for me to tell someone what Northampton was like if they asked me  --  unless they asked me a specific question , you know , such as what is Rahar 's like . " " What is Rahar 's like ? " " Pretty crumby . " " Well , that about covers Korea , too , " he said . " What about the riots ? I 've read a lot about them in the papers and everything . Now that Rhee is gone , is it going to get any better ? " " I guess so , " he said . " I do n't know , really . . . . I guess , I guess I really do n't care . . . . No , that is n't true , really . . . . I guess I do care . But I do n't know . The whole country is in such terrible shape now that I do n't see how it can help but get better . " He looked at her helplessly . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work do you plan to do ? " " Funny you should ask me that . " P.S. smiled . " My entire family is interested in the same question . I 've been trying to figure out what I do want to do . And I pretty well decided that I 'm going to go into the government . . . . At least that 's where I thought I 'd start first looking for a job . " " I should think you 'd have had enough of that after Korea . " " Well , no , not really .... I think Korea made me aware of just how bad working for the government could be  --  but , I do n't know . A lot of it  --  the government  --  is the people , and there were some pretty terrible people in Korea . I do n't mean the Koreans , I mean the Americans there . " " Like whom ? " " Oh , well , Linda , you know . . . you read The Ugly American . . . " P.S. looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he tried to think of how long it had been since he had worn brown shoes . He looked up and suddenly realized that she had mistaken his silence for deep concern about her question , and he tried to think of an example of an " Ugly American " in Korea . " You want an example ? " She nodded . " Well , there was my commanding officer , " he said . And then he paused and started again . " In Korea , there was sort of ap101problem with  --  ahhh  --  prostitutes . Ahhh , they were cutting through the barbed-wire fence around our compound ... " " Why ? Were they trying to steal things ? " " Well , yes and no . " P.S. smiled . " Is n't there some song about a stolen kiss , a stolen embrace , a stolen moment with you-u-u-u ? Well , it was something along that line . . . " He paused , and then he suddenly assumed a mock paternal pose and placed his hand on hers . " You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barracks with the men , and this was against Army Regulations . ... Not only because the men needed their sleep , but also becausesince we were , after all , an intelligence-type unit , we had a lot of stray secrets lying around loose and if those secrets were taken , well , they would n't be secrets any more . " He had the feeling that he was wrong . He knew , he was certain that Linda thought he was making fun of her . And he was n't , and he did n't know how to make her understand that . The problem was merely that he was not yet mentally out of Korea . Even though he was physically sitting on the porch with Linda , he found it hard to take her questions seriously . " But why would the girls cut through the fences ? Why did n't they just meet the soldiers outside ? " " Well , usually , the girls knew the GIs and maybe the GIs owed them money , or had promised them a radio , or maybe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jilted her . . . . Anyway , the commanding officer decided that the only way to stop them from cutting through the fences was to shave the head of the first one caught . " " But that 's terrible ! " she said . " Why could n't he just arrest them or something ? The girl probably could n't help herself . " " Well  --  I keep saying well . ' " P.S. laughed . " What I mean is that these girls , as you call them  --  " He thought suddenly of how the major had jumped on him for referring to the prostitutesas girls . . . Am I so much like this girl , here ? Was I that naive ? " Anyway , they were n't like Dreiser 's Sister Carrie . . . And it would n't have done any good to arrest them because we would have had to turn them over to the Korean Police , and they would n't have done anything . " " Why not ? Those girls  --  prostitutes , broke the law , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a barbed-wire fence is breaking a very minor law compared to their obeying the law of survival . " " But what happened ? Did you shave the girl 's head ? " " We caught one one night , and I was supposed to shave her head , but I did n't , I could n't , " he said . " I could n't have either , " Linda said . I could n't have either ? . . . P.S. did n't know what he could tell Linda to make her understand that it was n't as simple a decision as she implied . He wanted to make her understand that it would have been far easier for him to have shaved the prostitute'shead ... Would it have been easier ? . . . He was a little angry at Linda for not realizing how difficult a decision it hadbeen . . . Had it been difficult ? Had n't I always known that I was n't going to shave the prostitute 's head ? And P.S. knew thatno matter how ugly Korea was , no matter how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow apart from the P. S. Wilkinson Linda Bates had seen with Hilary , there still remained some common bond of behavior . . . . And he began to wonder as he sat there on the porch with the pretty blonde-haired girl beside him , and the sounds of the ocean and the cocktail party all around them , he began to wonder whether or not his act of defiance in Korea had taken any courage whatsoever . There wasnever any other choice . . . was there ? He knew that to LindaBates his decision not to shave the prostitute 's head was obvious . One did n't need to spend eighteen months in Korea to understand that . He wanted somehow to make the girl feel that his decision had taken courage . P.S. knew that now he was n't sure . He was no longer sure whether he had acted out of instinct or because he had decided for himself that it was wrong . He wished for a moment that Linda could see Korea ; if she saw Korea , then she might understand the complexities of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Linda Bates than a place where the United States had fought a war ten years ago  --  when she was twelve . " Well , anyway , " P.S. said , " the head-shaving incident was just an example of how wrong some Americans can be . " " And now you 're thinking of going into the government ? "  | " Yes , " P.S. said . He felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up . " Hi , Mom . " " I think we 're going , Phil . Mr. and Mrs. Bates said you could stay as long as you like . " " I 'd better go with you and Mac , " P.S. said . " I 've got to pack up and get ready to go . " He turned back to Linda , who was now standing and smoothing her dress . " I hope I did n't talk your ear off , " P.S. said . " I wish we had more time . I think it would take more time before I could make you understand about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be living in New York . Well , maybe I 'll see you there . I 'm sorry to run off like this , but I think I 'd better start getting organized . " " Well , I hope you did n't think I was too stupid , " Linda said . " Not at all . You were n't stupid at all . It was just hard for me to be objective , that 's all . Maybe by the time I see you in New York things will be in a little better perspective . " " Good , " she said . " I hope you 'll call me . " " I will indeed , " he said . He shook hands with her , then followed his mother through the other people standing around the porch and in the living room . " Linda 's a pretty girl , " P.S. 's mother said . " I liked her , " he said . " She was very nice . " " She looks very much like her mother . " Back at his stepfather 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lit the fire . His mother said , " I heard you tell Linda that you were thinking of going into the government . " " As I remember , you were thinking about the Foreign Service , " his stepfather said . " What about your father ? " P.S. 's mother asked . " What does he think you should do ? " " I do n't know , " P.S. said . " He 's still in Europe . I have n't seen him . " " But you do think you want to work for the government ? " his mother asked . P.S. 's stepfather crossed to the fire and stood with his back to it and clasped his hands behind his back . " I know your motherp104is concerned about you , " he said , " and she does n't want to seem to push you . " P.S. smiled at the two of them . " I understand and appreciate your concern . Mac , you and Mom have been very good about not asking me a lot of embarrassing questions like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He looked at the two of them again and then laughed . " Oh , come on , you both look like some sort of old engraving where the parents are asking their son whether he might not be wise to go into the family firm . . . . I know this is a serious problem , and I have given it some serious thought , and I 've decided I want to be a dress designer . " " A what ? " his stepfather asked , and then gave a deep , throaty chuckle . " That would make your father very proud . " " Be serious , Philip , " his mother said . " Oh , all right , I will be serious . You 're right , you did overhearme tell Linda that I wanted to go into the government . But the only reason I have n't said anything to the two of you is that I 'm not sure of the best way to go about it . " " You might get a pretty good job because of your training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Photo Intelligence ? " " That and Yale . " " Well , I was thinking of something like that . " " Like what ? " his mother said . " I have some friends in most parts of the government , and you might talk to them , " his stepfather said . " Or , I could write them a letter . It does n't do anybody any harm to ask someone for help . It can save you a lot of wasted effort and sitting on your hands . " " Well , I appreciate the offer , " P.S. said , " but you have n't let me tell you what I want to do . I mean , I 've changed a lot since I listed future occupation : government ' in the Yale Class Book . " " How have you changed ? " his mother asked . " The two of you have been so nice about pretending not to notice about my missing leg . . . . Oh , all right , we 'll be absolutely serious . When I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late-night bull sessions I could sling words like create , " neces/sity , ' responsibility ' with the best of them . . . . And I think at Yale I really did want to go into the government . I had a feeling that I could be of some use . " P.S. saw his stepfather 's skepticism and added , " Mac , I knew I was n't going to shape the world , or make This World a Better Place to Live In . . . . I may have been idealistic , but I was n't entirely out of my mind . " " Fair enough , " his stepfather said . " Anyway , after eighteen months in Korea , I saw just how little difference I could make , and I learned other things  --  " " Like what ? " his mother asked . " Oh , I do n't know , Mom .... They are n't things you can describe , it 's more just a realization or an awareness of limitations . It is n't anything you can really measure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a half ; it 's more a realization of what , of how far you 'd go to keep that breath going in and out . I know this sounds sort of melodramatic , and I ca n't really help it . Korea is unbelievable . . . life in Korea is unbelievable ... the values change . This is what I was trying to explain to Linda at the cocktail party . . . . You learn that your being in Korea is no different from being an occupying force . The Koreans hate us , and why should n't they ? We get drunk all the time , we spend too much money  --  a lieutenant like myself makes more money than a Korean general  --  and , and I guess after a while we even start despising the Koreans ; but even worse , we degrade them , we humiliate them and in so doing debase ourselves even more . " " In what way ? " his mother asked . " Oh , well , Mom , you know . . . it was n't very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Circus " where the officers from Seoul would go to watch three naked Korean women perform . It meant nothing to the women , it was all rehearsed and skillfully executed , and the men spent five dollars to watch them do it . P.S. had gone and was so ashamed that he had contributed to this , and was so ashamed by the excitement on the other officers ' faces , that he had never been able to go back , or tell anyone about it , or see those other officers without loathing them for their knowing he , too , had once gone . " I guess it 's justp106not what Eisenhower had in mind with his People-to-People program . " " But , Phil , " his stepfather said , " you must realize that happenswherever armies go ... " " I know , sir , but to degrade people , to turn them into animals is such a terrible , terrible thing . Do you know what the United States and Korea have developed in the ten years of their association ? A new form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually thrives on it . And now it 's spread to Japan , Okinawa , Southeast Asia . . . and there 's no hope that any of this will change . I mean , it 's the only thing  --  this availability of the women  --  that makes Korea bearable . . . . And the thing you have to understand is that all of this  --  pardon the expression  --  all of this screwing around probably is good for Korea and the United States . After all , it helps support Korea 's economy , and it keeps the men quiet enough so that they do n't get trigger happy . The thing , the one thing that really shocked me in Korea was that we supported Syngman Rhee ... and after a while I even got used to that . And Rhee would still be there now if it had n't been for the Korean students ' rioting . They 're the ones who got rid of him , and last month , when Rhee was granted asylum in Hawaii , he took twenty-eight million dollars with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think government is terribly important , someone somehow must make sure that the United States finds better men to support than Syngman Rhee . " " Then you 'd want to go into the Foreign Service ? " his mother asked . " Well , no , not right away . " " What do you want to do ? " his stepfather asked . " In Korea I saw that even though I did n't like the Koreans I could work with them , and you can take my word for the fact that their Photo Intelligence was every bit as good and in some areas a helluva lot better than ours . What I 'm trying to say is that there has to be a new generation who see that the United States is n't the red , white , and blue answer to everybody 's prayer , other countries can do a lot of things better than we can and do it without us . . . . I ca n't seem to explain this well , " he said . " Myp107point simply is that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and politically aware of our own country 's limitations . . . . I think there has to be a realism which currently our country does n't have . . . . I am also realistic enough to think that there is n't much time . And because there is n't much time , I 've been giving serious thought to going into the CIA . " " The CIA I " his stepfather exploded . " Good God , I preferred it when you said you were going to be a dress designer . At least those fairies are out in the open . " " Why the CIA , Philip ? " his mother asked . " Well , first off , I have no intentions of staying in the CIA  --  " " Thank God for that ! " " Let him finish , dear , " his mother said . " As I said , I have no intentions of staying in the CIA , " P.S. continued , " but , as we said earlier , I do have this training . In Madison Avenue-ese , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it , and the supply is low . Therefore , I should be able to get very good money while I 'm doing it . " " But , Philip , you 're not going to do it just for the money ? " his mother asked . " No , not entirely . I like the money , but I 'm doing it because of something I think is called a lateral transfer . ' . . . I already have two years of government service behind me , the Army counts as that , and with my intelligence training I could go into the CIA as a GS-8 , GS-9 , and maybe even get a GS-10 rating in a year  --  and that 's one helluva lot higher than I would be if I started as a Foreign Service officer trainee . " " But what is this transfer ? " " I 'm getting to that , Mom . After a couple of years with the CIA I can cross-transfer into the Foreign Service  --  " " As an Intelligence officer ? " his stepfather asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm saying is why not take advantage of whatever head start I can get ? Why not let my training and my Army experience work for me instead of starting at the bottom all over again ? " " But if the Foreign Service is what you really want to do , would n't you be wiser to start right in ? " " I do n't think so , Mom . I think I can avoid an awful lot of crapp108by going in later . " He turned to his stepfather . " What do you think ? " " Well , if you 're right about what you 're saying , then I guess it makes sense . " " I 'm sure I 'm right , Mac , " P.S. said . " And anyway , it seems to me I would be better off to start doing something I know about , and while I 'm doing it I can be looking around . " " Well , I think that makes sense . . . . Look around , see what there is . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't work out then what the hell  --  I 've blown a couple of years . I 'll be only twenty-seven , twenty-eight at the most . " " God , I wish I were twenty-eight again , " his stepfather said . P.S. 's mother smiled . " What would you do , dear ? " " Call you up and ask you to dinner , " he said . " That was how many ? Twenty-three years ago . I 'd like to have known you twenty-three years ago . That would have made it 1937 . " P.S. 's mother was figuring dates in her head . " Philip was one year old , Page was four , and Carter was six . . . . Would you have still asked me for dinner ? " " Nineteen thirty-seven ... " P.S. 's stepfather was thinking . " You know , I had a Packard convertible then . Dark green , almost black ... P.S. Wilkinson called Charlie Merritt that night and said that he would be in Baltimore in time for the Groom 's Dinner and wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delighted to be the best man , and that he would provide his own cutaway , and would he need to bring a dinner jacket ? The next morning he said good-by to his stepfather , thanked him for his advice , and said he would be sure to let him know how everything turned out . Then he got into the car with his mother , and they did not speak until they reached the station . " The train wo n't be due for another five minutes , " his mother said . " I was trying to think on the way over how I could thank you and Mac , but you in particular . "  | " For what ? " " For so many things , Mom . . . . I think most of all for not pushing those first days I was back , for understanding ... " " I 've never worried about you , Philip . I feel you 've done everything any of us ever wanted you to do and now it 's your turn to do what you want for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rest . Remember , you have that three hundred dollars a month from your grandfather 's estate , and I 'll give you some to tide you over  --  " " You do n't have to do that , Mom . " " I know I do n't need to . I want to . I 'm very proud of you . We 're all very proud of you . " " Well , I appreciate it , but I think you 'd better save your pride until you see me really do something . " " You 'll do all right , whatever you do . . . Mac 's very fond of you , you know . " " He 's a wonderful man . " " He meant what he said about helping you . " " I know he did . He said something to me about it again this morning . " P.S. smiled and added , " He also mentioned that he thinks I 'd be a lot better off in something other than the CIA  --  State , for instance . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's talking about . And one thing , Philip , when he says he can help you , do n't think he 's peddling influence . He 'd never do that . And do n't be too proud to accept . " " I know , Mom . Do n't worry , if I need help I 'll ask him . But it 's as I told him , I just do n't want to waste any of his friends ' time until I 'm sure I need them . " " Whatever you say . " " Mom . . . " P.S. said . He looked at her and wished he could say all the things he wanted to say to her . He wished he could explain to her why , after the divorce , he had had to go with his father . But he knew that she understood . " It 's nice to see you again . " The train blew for the crossing and P.S. got out of the car , removed his bag from the back seat , and walked around to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For everything . I 'll let you know what happens and where I am . . . And thank Mac , too . " " Take care of yourself , Philip . " P.S. leaned through the window and kissed her cheek . " I wish I 'd known you twenty-three years ago . " His mother looked a little surprised , and for the first time that P.S. could remember , a little embarrassed . And then she smiled and said , " But you did . "  | P.S. TOOK THE TRAIN to Penn Station , then caught a cab out to La Guardia and flew directly to Washington . He got himself a room in a pleasant and inexpensive small hotel not far from DuPont Circle and went to the Central Intelligence Agency for his first interview . The personnel officer told him that he was in luck , that he could fill out the preliminary forms and take the first tests that afternoon . Wilkinson filled out the personalhistory form and when he came to the section asking why he wanted to work for the government he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work there because he had nothing better to do , so he put down instead that he had been trained by the military , that his training was valuable , that he had had actual experience in combat situations , that he thought his knowledge of North Korea could be of use , and that he thought it was the responsibility of every citizen who could afford to to work for the government . He handed in the forms and was told to report at 2:30 to begin the tests . He thanked the personnel officer and left the building , certain that a Soviet agent in the apartment building across the street was taking his photograph , so he shielded his face and went into a restaurant around the corner and had lunch . At 2:30 he was sent up to the third floor to a small classroom to take the tests . He sat down at a small desk and was given a set of forms with eight hundred questions asking such thingsp112as how much would he like to be a member of a sheriff 's posse and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scared --  Did n't care- to get cancer  --  Might like -- Wanted very muchHehanded his answer sheets to the woman who sat at the head of the classroom and she said , " Thank you very much , Mr. , uh , Wilkinson . We 'll get in touch with you . " " About when ? " " Well , we ca n't tell you that , " she said . " But , you see , I 'm staying at a hotel here in town . If it 's going to be tomorrow I can leave word at the hotel . Or would it be the beginning of this coming week ? Next week ? Two weeks from now ? Next month ? " " We 'll let you know as soon as we can . " " Miss , all I want is a rough idea so I can give you an idea of where to reach me . Today is Thursday . I 'll be in Baltimore over the weekend , then I 'll be back here in Washington on Monday . But , if I 'm not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's no point in my hanging around Washington . I was thinking of maybe going up to New York . " " Well , you should receive word early this coming week . But we ca n't count on it . " " I see , " he said . " How would it be if I called you should I change my address ? " " But you should n't call me , sir . " " Then whom do I call ? If I move I 'd like to be sure that your message gets to me . " " I 'll give you a number to call . " Wilkinson watched her tear a sheet off a blank memo pad . She wrote nothing more than a telephone number on it and handed it across the desk to Wilkinson . He half-expected her to say , " Memorize this number , then burn this piece of paper and swallow the ashes . " Wilkinson left the building , this time not caring if a Sovietp113agent photographed him . He tried to think of what he could do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could n't remember whom he knew who still lived in Washington . In the year and a half he had been away a lot of people had moved in and out of Washington , so he decided to go back to his hotel , wash up , have dinner , and go to a movie . P. S. Wilkinson slept late Friday morning . Charlie Merritt had said that he would n't have to be at the farm until the cocktails before dinner at seven , but that he was more than welcome at any time he wished to come  --  especially if he arrived in time for lunch . P.S. knew it would be the last time Charlie would have a relatively free lunch with his parents , and he did n't want to interfere . P.S. made up his mind to get to Baltimore around five , and he strolled out into Washington 's pre-summer heat wave . When he had been a freshman at the Virginia Preparatory School , he and Charlie Merritt used to sign out for Washington every chance they got . They would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they 'd go into all the Army surplus stores , the magic stores , the sports equipment stores , and then they 'd try to get into the Pix or one of the other movies showing nudist films . They would sit in the dark , sweaty theaters , smelling the drunks , their cigars , their hair grease , their awful breath and odors , and he and Charlie would try to ignore them to concentrate wild-eyed on the flickering screen , the mammoth-breasted girls who would step-stride-turn , stepstride-turnas they tossed off their sequin-encrusted gowns to the off-music sounds of the bands . And after the movie they would go from bar to bar trying to get a drink , but were , as always , told , " Get outta here , kid . You want me to lose my license ? Go home to yur mudder . " And they 'd end up at the Smithsonian Institution  --  that incredible mishmash of a museum which had the best aviation building in the world where a couple of small boys could walk right up and  --  if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's SPAD . The Aviation Buildingwas P.S. 's favorite building in Washington . Glass cases contained the most intricate and beautiful scale models of air-114planes a small boy could ever covet and hunger to touch . But even though they could not be touched , they could be seen suspendedfrom thin wires in the case , eternally bucking strong headwinds as they raced over painted landscapes into adventure . The first biplane . The first mail plane . The real hull of the NC-4 seaplane which made the first flight around the world . The real Bell jet fighter , the first jet plane America built . Bits of insignia from World War I German planes . Real uniforms used by the Lafayette Escadrille . Hundreds of photographs of pilots who were braver than God and who stood , smiling crookedly , one elbow on the lower wing of their planes , and at their feet the small mongrel mascot , its head and tail a blur of excitement . And the planes themselves : Sopwith Camels , SPADs , Fokker D-IIIs , SE-5s , Fokker Triplanes , like the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nieuports , Bleriots , the Gotha bomber , the Albatross with the wings which looked as though Leonardo da Vinci might have designed them , and Bristols . And after they left the aviation exhibits they could always cross the Mall to the National Gallery and look at the nudes . " Well , my God , why should n't we ? They 're ART , are n't they ? " And then it would be time to get back on the bus for school . P.S. and Charlie had two years of that , and then P.S. was expelled from the Virginia Preparatory School for cheating on his Latin examination . Charlie was the only person P.S. had ever been able to talk to about that . And they continued to be friends , wrote each other letters , saw each other during the summer . They roomed together freshman year on the Old Campus at Yale , and again sophomore year when they lived in Branford College . But junior and senior years they roomed alone so that they would be able to get some work done . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined the family fraternity  --  St. Anthony Hall . But that was all over with . The Charlie Merritt who had sat in the dark girly movies with P. S. Wilkinson was getting married tomorrow . And P.S. could get a drink from any bartender , could go to any movie , do anything he wanted . He took a taxi to Georgetown and spent the rest of the morning walking around the quiet streets , wanting to live there , hoping to runp115into some young woman , some girl he had known before , and when it was too hot to walk any more he entered a small French restaurant on M Street off Wisconsin Avenue which had **31;6160;TOOLONG , badly painted murals of Paris scenes , and a waiter came over to take his order . Wilkinson said he wanted a dozen snails and a bottle of ale , and the waiter answered , " Doodah , doodah ! " He finished lunch , and since it was only a little after one he thought he might catch a nap before he had to arrange for a rented car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Charlie 's place . He went back to his hotel , went up to his room and called the desk , asking the operator to wake him at three.  |p116CHARLIE  MERRITT 'S PARENTS lived on a farmjust outside of Baltimore in the Maryland Hunt Cup country of rolling hills and green grass that should only be seen in the setting sun . P.S. drove through the whitewashed brick gates , then along the long curving drive toward the main building . On either side , white post-and-rail fences and shade trees paralleled the road . One side was farmed , the other was grazing land for the horses . He pulled in behind the house and twisted the rear-view mirror to get a look at himself . He looked tired ; but the tan he had picked up from the week of nervously pacing the beach had compensated . It was 5:30 ; and P.S. got his suitcase out of the back of the rented car and walked up to the house . The Merritt house , framed on either side by oak trees , was a three-story old brick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it gave ; but it was old enough to have assumed the patina of antique velvet , as though the bricks if rubbed might be furry to the touch . P.S. stood for a moment before the house just looking at it , admiring it , remembering it from school vacation visits with Charlie . My God , it 's nice to be back , P.S. thought . He felt as though he should put his suitcase down and sit on it and just look at the house , and he smiled at the rising excitement he felt . In just a few minutes he would see Charlie Merritt , he would see Charlie 's family , he would see some old friends he had n't seen since college . He would meet the bridesmaids and maybe one of them would love him , if only for the course of the wedding.  | " P.S.

Charlie Merritt was pumping P.S. 's hand and saying , " Lord , I 'm glad you could make it ! When I got your phone call , I just could n't believe it . I did n't think you were ever going to get out of Korea , at least not in time for the wedding . I 'm so happy to see you ! " P.S. could not stop himself smiling long enough to speak . He just stood there looking at his friend , trying to see how he had changed in the year and a half , trying to see in his friend 's eyes whether he , himself , had changed . " There 's so much I want to talk to you about , " P.S. finally managed to say . " My God , it 's been a long time since we 've seen each other . How long has it been ? " " A long time , " P.S. said . " Almost two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Has it been that long ? " Charlie asked in wonderment . " Well , you look just great . Just great . The Army must have done you some good . " " I guess so , " P.S. said , the first uneasiness having touched him . There was no doubt that Charlie was happy to see him ; it was n't that . It was Charlie 's amazed " Has it been that long ? " ... You 're goddam right it was that long ! P.S. thought , and he could not help resenting Charlie 's unawareness of it and , worse , Charlie 's having avoided the service . P.S. followed Charlie into the house . They walked down the hallway with the hunting prints , the giant brass umbrella stand , the needlepoint-covered bench , P.S. wanting to pause and touch them all . Charlie 's hair is longer and his face . . . Something 's changed . . . Is it thinner ? Older ? P.S.wanted time to turn his friend around and look at him , but Charlie was hurriedly leading him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mom , Dad , look who 's here ! "  |p118Charlie  's parents were leaning over the kitchen table with a seating plan for the evening 's dinner . Mrs. Merritt was the first to speak . " Why , hello , dear P.S. , it 's so nice to see you again . It 's been such a long time . " " Hello , Mrs. Merritt , " P.S. said , wanting to kiss her , but he had his suitcase and there was no place to put it down . Charlie 's father patted P.S. on the back . " Well , gosh , boy , it 's nice to see you again . You look fine , just fine . It 's like old times having you here again ! " Charlie and his father were about the same height , 5 feet 5 , and they looked like dwarfs next to P.S. 's 6 feet 3 . At the VirginiaPreparatory School , P.S. and Charlie had been known as Mutt and Jeff . " Thank you , sir , " P.S. said . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nancy ? " Mr. Merritt asked . " Upstairs resting , " Charlie said . " She was tired , so I told her to lie down . It 's going to be a long , long night . " He turned to P.S. " You 've never met Nancy , have you ? " " I do n't think so , " P.S. said . " You were away , I guess . " You " guess " ! . . . Charlie , Charlie , it was five hundred and forty-seven days ! " How 's your father ? " Mr. Merritt asked . " Oh , he 's fine , sir . I have n't seen him yet . He 's still in Europe . " " Well , make sure you give him my best when you see him , will you ? " " I certainly will , sir . " " I 'm taking P.S. off now , Dad . I want him to get to know some of the others before he has to call on them for toasts . " " What others ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the ushers . They 're all outside playing softball . " " Fine . Anything you say . " " As a matter of fact we have a couple of young lovelies who have been waiting to meet you . " " My pleasure . " P.S. laughed . That 's more like it . Take it easy ! He followed Charlie again , this time out of the house and overp119to the field near the barn . He could see young couples playing softball  --  the males in khakis and sport shirts , the girls in Bermudashorts and sleeveless blouses . And P.S. felt terribly out of place . Not just because of his suit and cordovan shoes , but because he did n't care if he ever played softball again . P.S. suddenly looked at Charlie in his khakis , his pink button-down shirt , the bright red-and-yellow belt , the tennis shoes . And he looked at Charlie 's face , noticing new lines . . . . Do you get lines at twentyfour ? ... Charlie and P.S. sat down together on the edge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie , something important , for had n't he been looking forward to seeing Charlie again for such a long time ? But what 's the matter ? Whyca n't I  --  why ca n't we . . . It 's so strange ! Is it possible that he feels as uneasy with me as I do with him ? We 're best friends , he 's my best friend ! P.S. turned away from Charlie and stared stony-faced at the softball players as though they , and their softball game , and the Merritt house were a way of life which had become obsolete . " Got a surprise for you , " Charlie said . " Take a look at who 's playing center field . " Cheer up , Wilkinson . Make the effort ! P.S. squinted into thesetting sun . " It looks like Elsa Maxwell .... No , it 's Mamie Eisenhower . . . . No , do n't tell me , let me guess . . . Dorothy Kilgallen ? " " Sonny Tufts ! ? " Charlie laughed . " Look closely . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make out who it was . All he could see was that it was a girl . She had her back to him and she was flipping a Frisbee back and forth with the boy playing right field . There was the wet thunk of the soft ball being hit , and P.S. watched it loft lazily over the second baseman'shead . The girl turned from her Frisbee and ran in to pick up the ball . It was Hilary Farnum  --  the only girl P.S. had ever really known , who had ever loved him as much as he had loved her , the girl who had got married six weeks after his arrival in Korea , the girl who was now Mrs. Bruce Mallory , and who now had Bruce Mallory 's child . P.S. stood up . He was shocked , then embarrassed  --  as though he had been caught peeping  --  when Hilary saw him , too . She did not pick up the ball , and P.S. lookedp120away from her to Charlie , then back to her . God damn them , is this some sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He turnedback to Charlie and asked tensely , " What 's she doing here ? " " She 's a bridesmaid . " " Good God . " He watched the second baseman field the ball and Hilary went back to her position in center field , but she still glanced toward P.S. " I told you you 'd be surprised , " Charlie said . " Turns out she 's a good friend of Nancy 's . I did n't even know Nancy knew her until we were making up the list of whom we wanted in the wedding . She said she wanted Hilary Mallory ... " " Jesus Christ , " P.S. said . He sat back down on the grass next to Charlie . " " Hilary did n't know you were going to be here either . " " You wanted to surprise her , too ? " P.S. asked . " Take it easy , old buddy , take it easy , " Charlie said . " If either of you had known the other would be here , probably neither of you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , were we wrong ? " " What 's her husband like ? " " Bruce ? I only met him once . Seems like a nice guy . He 's not here , " Charlie said . " He 's in some place like Alabama looking for a factory site . " " A what ? " " Factory site . At least that 's what Hilary told me . " P.S. looked across the field at Hilary . He knew she was pretendingthat she did n't know he was watching . But he thought her motions were much too careful , too nervous , too deliberately calmed , to be real . He tried to analyze his feelings for her as he sat on the edge of the ball field watching her . And he could n't . He did n't know how he felt . There was still the shock but he sensed his feelings were n't the same as they had been before . When they were in love with each other . It was as though he were incapable of committing his feelings until she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty good , considering , does n't she ? " Charlie said . " Considering what ? "  | " I hear she and Bruce are having some sort of trouble . " " What kind of trouble ? " P.S. asked . He felt the hope flash through him , the hope that it was some terrible , irrevocable marriage problem , that they were going to get a divorce . " Oh , you know , the usual early marriage trouble . " " Well , I hope not , " P.S. lied . " I hope there 's nothing seriously wrong . . . . They have a child , now . " The inning ended and the players moved off the field . " Looks like the game 's breaking up , " Charlie said . " Umm . " Oh , my God , here she comes . . . . What can I say to her ? " When was the last time you saw Hilary ? " " Commencement . 1958 . But it was all over by then . " P.S. stood up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner jacket . If I 'm going to have to wear it tonight , I might as well try to make it look as though it had n't been slept in . " " Chicken . " " Chicken ? What 's chicken about hanging up a dinner jacket ? " " Hilary 's coming this way and you 're running . " " Oh , lay off , Charlie , there will be plenty of time for Hilary and me to see each other during the wedding . " Walking up the stairs behind Charlie , P.S. heard the front door open and Hilary talking to some of the others , then he heard her ask where Charlie had gone . " What do you bet she comes up ? " Charlie asked . " And I 'm going to be right beside you , old tennis shoe , old horse trader . I would n't miss this for all the tea in Lipton 's . " They entered the bedroom and Charlie showed P.S. which bed was to be his . He listened to the sound of footsteps climbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began rummagingaround busily . There was a light knock on their door and P.S. knew without turning that it was Hilary . He was physically aware of her standing behind him . He could feel it in his skin . " Well , hi , Hilary ! " Charlie said . " I bet you remember my best old friend in the whole wide world , P. S. Wilkinson , formerly of Korea and Yale ... " Lay off , Charlie ... just lay off it for a while.  |p122P.S.  turned slowly , preparing himself to look at her and not to show anything . " Hello , Hilary . " " Hello , " she said . She was not smiling either . P.S. did n't know what to say to her . He did n't know whether he should shake her hand or kiss her or just nod . He stood there looking at her , seeing how lovely she was , what the differences were since they had seen each other . Her hair was darker than he remembered , and of course it was worn differently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little brighter , perhaps a little more mature than they had been . She was still tall , almost 5 feet 10 , that would n't have changed , her dark hair almost black and so very fine and framing the pale skin , making her look almostthe way high-key photographs make models look . " I do n't want to be in the way , " Charlie said . " I 'm sure the two of you have a lot to talk about , " " No , stay , " Hilary said . " I only wanted to say hello . I 've got to check on Nancy . " " Well , how have you been ? " P.S. asked her , wishing to God he could think of something sensible to say . " Fine , " she said . He watched her leave , then he turned quickly and messed up his suitcase . " Well , the two of you certainly went at it like a pair of jay birds . " Charlie laughed . " I could just barely squeeze a word in edgewise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on much of a show , " P.S. said angrily . Charlie walked over to the wall mirror and went through the motions of adjusting his belt , checking his shirt , looking at his teeth . " I 'm going to go see Nancy for a few minutes . " He started out the door , smiled , and said , " You want me to send Hilary back to you ? " " Lay off , please , Charlie . " " You really are serious , are n't you ? " " Yes , " P.S. said and he was distressed by Charlie 's surprise , Charlie 's mouth silently framing " Good God ! " P.S. unpacked his dinner jacket and trousers and hung them up . He took longer than he needed to unpack , half-hoping that Hilary would return . But when it became apparent that she was n't going to , he set out his dress shirt , studs , cuff links , onp123the bed along with a pair of black silk socks , the butterfly bow tie , his vest , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduation present from Yale . P.S. finished dressing , and while he stood in front of the wall mirror adjusting his tie , fussing with his handkerchief , and waiting for Charlie , he thought again about the curious estrangementhe felt from this sort of life . The pomp , the ceremony , the pageantry of a family wedding seemed only pomp , ceremony , and pageantry . He felt no warmth over seeing Charlie .... The whole wedding had adopted a secondary emphasis in P.S. 's mind . There was only Hilary , and the confusion he felt over seeing her . And he knew he had to get over that . After all , there was Charlie and the problem of a friendship which had almost ceased to have meaning . Could they get along just pretending things had n't changed , that things would n't change if for one moment he were to step out of character and not be the groom 's best friend , but instead indicate that he no longer felt any friendship for him ? How could so much have happened since they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the years Charlie had had for his own self , the time to fall in love with a girl and to get married while P.S. had been in the Army , the time to find a job and to start working upwards in it , while P.S. had only a small wallet-sized card saying that he had served honorably in the Army of the United States . P.S. felt as though he was standing absolutely alone and was not moving , and that everyone else was on a sort of moving sidewalk which kept them hurtling through time and space and life in a fixed direction . For the time being he felt that he did not belong . And maybe Charlie sensed that , too . When Charlie was dressed , he and P.S. walked downstairs to the living room . Mr. and Mrs. Merritt were there , and Charlie and P.S. fixed themselves drinks and sat down opposite Charlie 's parents . " Well , Son , how do you feel ? " Mr. Merritt asked . " Nervous ? " " Not a bit . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun , I 'll have to get married more often  --  to Nancy , of course . ... When do we expect Mr. and Mrs. Hammond ? "  | " They 'll be here soon , " Mrs. Merritt said . She turned to P.S. " You do n't know Nancy 's parents , do you ? " " I do n't think so , " P.S. said . " I may have met him here during some Christmas vacation , but I do n't think I 've ever met her . " P.S. looked at Charlie curiously .... " Having a ball , I 'll have toget married more often ! " Christ , what kind of crap is that , Charlie ? ... Do you remember me  --  me , P.S.1 Your old friend who snuck into girly films with you , who had water pistol fights with you in the college dining hall . . . . Do you remember the time we put you in a trunk and left you outside Skull and Bones ? P.S. smiled over at Charlie and Charlie smiled back . P.S. wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or whip out a water pistol or anything that would make P.S. feel that they still had something in common . Charlie raised his glass and silently toasted P.S. ; and P.S. returned the toast feeling miserable . Then he heard the sound of high heels and his stomach tightened at the thought that it might be Hilary . P.S. turned toward the sound . But no one was there . The doorbell rang and the first guests began to enter . Mr. and Mrs. Hammond were there , and a couple of the bridesmaids . Mrs. Hammond went upstairs to check on Nancy , and P.S. found himself caught in the corner with Mr. Hammond , who had been a Marine during the Second World War and had taken part in the invasion of Okinawa . He wanted to know if Okinawa looked the same , and P.S. tried to explain that he had never been to Okinawa . He had been in Tokyo a couple of times but the rest of the time he had been in Korea . " Jesus , that place was green , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The brightest green you ever saw . " An usher P.S. had n't met came over and said that he had been in Okinawa and P.S. took the opportunity to move away . He saw Hilary standing on the other side of the living room with another bridesmaid , Wendy Potter . Mrs. Merritt was saying , " Why does n't everybody move outside ? It 's nice and cool on the terrace . " P.S. crossed to Hilary , swallowed , and asked if she 'd like a drink . Hilary shook her head , and P.S. asked the same question of Wendy.  | " Nothing for me , thanks , " Wendy said . " I 'll leave the two of you alone since I know you must have a lot to talk about . " P.S. watched her walk away and wanted to give her the finger . " My God , what 's going on here ? What is this ? Everyone seems to be  --  I do n't know what  --  setting up a scene between us or something . " " I 've been getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should n't have come . I would n't have except that I thought you were still in Korea . I guess if I 'd known for sure that you 'd be here , I would n't have come . " " I did n't know I 'd be able to come until a couple of weeks ago . Not until last week , really , " he said . Then , after a moment , his tongue black and swollen in his mouth , " You really look marvelous . How are you ? " " Fine . I 'm fine , " she said . " Just fine . " " That 's good . " He looked at her , trying to look through her dress , trying to remember . " And you . You 're looking well , too , " she said . " I feel well . I spent a week with my mother on Long Island . I just lay around on the beach for about a week , and I feel pretty good . " I feel awful . I feel stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fine . She 's fine , too . " And then he shrugged and laughed . " What the hell , everybody 's fine . How about if I get you a drink ? " " Not just yet . We can talk a little longer . " " Would you like a sip of mine ? As I remember , you used to drink bourbon . " She nodded , and P.S. handed her his glass . She took a sip and returned it . He looked at her lipstick on the rim of his glass . He suddenly had the most idiotic feeling that he should deliberately drink from where she had drunk . It was such a corny idea that he was furious at himself . Instead of drinking , he continued to hold the glass in his hand , conscious that his hand was so hot the ice was melting too fast . " You 're out of the Army for good now , are n't you ? " " So to speak . I 'm going to have to go to Reserve meetings once a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's all . "  | " What are you going to do now ? " " You mean what kind of job ? " " Something in intelligence ? Like your photo reconnaissance ? " " Something like that , " he said . " The CIA ? " " Not so loud ! " he said and forced a smile . Now , you smile , Hilary . Smile at me . Forget what you 're to smile about . Just smile once , once just for me , not for anything I said . " But is it the CIA ? " she asked again . " That depends on if they 'll give me a job . It depends on a lot of things . " " How much does that pay ? " " God , I do n't know , " P.S. said . " I had n't even thought of that . " He thought for a moment about her question . One of the reasons they had broken up after Yale was because she was so interested in how much money he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And when she found out how little he would make in the Army she had laughed at him , and he had never forgotten it . " What about the Foreign Service ? I thought you wanted to do that . " " Not yet . I just want to sit down in one place for a while . Get some roots . Some place like Georgetown . And lead a sort of Saturday Evening Post cover life . You know what I mean ? I mean a good dog , a good pipe , a good fire , a good brandy , a good woman . . . things like that . " Something like what you 're doing , Hilary . . . . Only you 're doing it with somebody else . " Fireplaces bring thirty dollars a month extra in Georgetown . " P.S. laughed and felt his lips were so dry that they would shatter . " What about yourself ? How are you doing ? " " How am I doing what ? " " I mean is everything okay with you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Was there something in her tone ? " And the baby ? I neverknew what it was . Cissie wrote me that you 'd had a baby , but she did n't say what kind . I mean , boy or girl . " " Girl . She 's fine . She 's growing up fast . She 's not a baby any more . She 's ten weeks old . She smiles now . "  | " And she 's  --  you 're living in Washington now ? " " Yes , she 's with a nurse . I have to leave tomorrow right after the wedding . " " What 's the baby 's name ? " " Hester . " " Hester ! My God , was n't that the name of the woman in The Scarlet Letter ? Hester Prynne ? And her daughter 's namewas Pearl . I did n't think anybody was called Hester any more . " " Well , it was Bruce 's mother 's name . " " Has she got a middle name ? Hester ? " " Farnum . Hester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her Farnum ? That 's not a bad name for a girl . " Hilary said , " Because we call her Hester . " She brushed at her dress  --  a gesture so familiar to P.S. whenever she was feeling stubborn . " Arid anyway , it does n't matter .... She does n't answer to anything . " " After Cissie wrote me I meant to congratulate you , but I did n't know your address . I was  --  well , anyway , I did n't think I ought to write you . " " She was born on your birthday . " " My birthday ? I 'll be damned . I do n't know anyone else who was born on my birthday . " " April twelfth . " " And yours is  --  My God , yours is tomorrow . June twentyfifth ! Will your husband be back tomorrow ? " " Bruce . " " I 'm sorry , Bruce . I knew his name . Will Bruce be back tomorrow ? " " No . " " That 's too bad . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie , I think it was  --  told me he was down in Alabama looking at plant sites . " " South Carolina . He works very hard . " " So , Hester 's birthday is the same as mine . That should be easy for me to remember . You two were married , when ? It was just after I arrived in Korea . "  | " December twenty-eighth . I was a Christmas bride . Hester was born fifteen months later , in case you want to count . " " Ahhh , Hilary , " he said gently . " I was n't going to count . I did n't mean anything , honest . I was n't sure exactly when you were married , that 's all . I wanted to get you a wedding present or something . " " There 's no need . " " But I 'd like to , " P.S. insisted . " At least let me get you a drink . " " No , thanks . Maybe I 'll just take another sip of yours . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tilted it to drink . She looked at him over the rim of the glass and P.S. felt the same almost-dizziness he used to feel whenever she looked straight at him . Then her eyes focused away from him . " Hey , you two lovebirds , break it up ! " It was Mr. Merritt , and P.S. felt himself start to burn . Charlie 's father put a hand on P.S. 's shoulder . " My gosh , boy , I 'm going to have to stand on a chair if I want to pat you on the top of your head . " " Yes , sir , " P.S. said . He had always hated jokes about his height . " Hilary 's about the right height though . " He turned to her . " All 's well with you , my dear ? " " Fine , thank you , " she said . " I 'm afraid I 'm going to have to take your beau away from you . He 's to be the toastmaster and I want him to learn some names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfair not to give the unmarried bridesmaids a chance at him . " P.S. looked quickly at Hilary and saw her anger for the moment . Then she said , " I was just leaving to talk to the others , too . " Mr. Merritt steered P.S. through the guests . " I feel I know you pretty well , my boy , so I 'm going to talk to you like an old friend . I would n't spend too much time with Hilary if I were you . People have a way of assuming the worst . They always like a chance to do some talking . " " Oh , come on , now , sir . Hilary and I have n't seen each other for almost two or three years now . We 're just old friends . My God , it is n't as though we were going to go to bed together . "  | " Well , make sure you do n't ever let that happen either . She 's a very attractive woman , but do n't ever forget the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married , Mr. Merritt . Believe me , I know that . " " Well , just a friendly word of advice from an older man . That 's all . Now . . . those two old people up ahead are Nancy 's grandparents . You 're going to have to speak loudly to him , he 's a bit deaf and wo n't admit it . " P.S. half-listened through the introductions , but all the time he was thinking about what Charlie 's father had said . Was it so wrong for him to talk to Hilary ? Hilary had had that strange look about her . He had seen that look at Yale sometimes  --  the look of someone who is lonely , a little bit lost perhaps  --  she used to remind him of a bird with a broken wing . He tried to remember their conversation and whether she had sounded bitter when she talked about Bruce . Had she sounded bitter because P.S. wanted her to be bitter ? Was it all in his imagination ? And what the hell could people have to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and talking ? What could be more natural than two people talking ? Charlie 's dinner did not start until 9:30 . And after the main course had been cleared away and the Baked Alaska was on the dessert plates , and the glasses were refilled with champagne , P.S. stood up and started the rounds of toasts . They were about what he had expected . The mother of the bride and the mother of the groom recounted how lucky their children were to find such perfect mates , then each told an anecdote which she felt would indicate how very lucky she felt the other child was to be married to hers . Then the fathers stood and told anecdotes all curiously limited to the period in the child 's life at which he or she was eight , nine , or ten  --  that period at which parents choose best to remember their children . And after the parents came the grandparents , and then the ushers in dinner jackets bought duringcollege days , and bridesmaids in demure , dull little dresses alternated stories  --  the ushers telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure Nancy was in lovep130with someone else . And the bridesmaids told how Nancy had plotted to trap Charlie , ever since she had met him at the MarylandHunt Cup in 1958 . And when it came to Hilary , she stood up and looked very scared . And perhaps a little high , and she tilted her champagne glass toward Charlie and Nancy , spilling it a little , and she said , " I hope you two  --  I just want to say , that I hope you and Charlie  --  that you , Nancy , and Charlie will both be awfully happy and that married life and everything can be such fun and . . . . And I want to say that I love you both dearly , and I just hope . . . I wish you can be happy together and love each other and for ever and ever just be so terribly happy .... " She sat down quickly , her face crimson . P.S. stood up at once and called on Nancy 's aunt to make a toast . Nancy 's aunt was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toast , and the dinner settled back to normal . P.S. felt Hilary 's toast was so unlike her , so wrong for her , and he looked at her hoping to reassure her , but Hilary was staring down at her plate . It was n't until the last of the toasts that she looked up and began again to take part in the dinner . After the toasts everyone pushed back from the table and stood up and moved into the living room where the furniture had been lined against the wall and the rug taken up for dancing . P.S. , too , had made the move into the living room . There was a rush for the bar and P.S. hung back . " Dear P.S. , " Charlie 's mother said , placing her hand on his arm , " you did such a nice job on the toasts . These stories about Charlie at V.P.S. were so delightful ! Of course I never knew you two snuck off into Washington ! " Nancy 's father thanked P.S. for calling on Nancy 's grandmother and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hammond , it was Mrs. Lee  --  but other than that , young man , you did a fine job . " Mr. Hammond was replaced by a bridesmaidwho asked P.S. which of the ushers was the one expelled from the Virginia Preparatory School for cheating . P.S. said that he had been the one and he moved back from her and edged out of the living room and around the corner to the front hall and sat down on the stairway beneath a Paul Brown drawing of a mare and foal . He was so terribly disappointed by the dinnerp131and the toasts . He remembered how much he had looked forward to being here . He remembered sitting in his BOQ room in Korea looking at the invitation , knowing what enormous fun he would be having with Charlie , the other ushers , and how there would be bridesmaids , not mooses , and how nice and good it would be to see Charlie 's parents and the other older people . He had imagined a weekend filled with friendships and conversations and humor and toasts and love and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which his memory would so thirstily absorb after the despair of the past eighteen months . He had wanted this to be a wedding that Charlie , especially , would never forget  --  a great flood of happiness which would provide such a solid base of shared joy for Nancy and Charlie that the two of them would never be able to think back on their wedding without knowing that everyone there remembered it , too . P.S. had wanted the dinner and the toasts and the interplay of friendships and love to be an evening which would warm even Mrs. Lee 's cooling memories . But instead the evening was beginning to become another Christmas with Charles Street for P.S. and not the rich , incredible cornucopia of warm thoughts , visions , asides , memories , which formed the insights , the vignettes of a family 's love . The trio was warming up , and P.S. could hear the rattle of ice cubes dropping into drinks at the bar . He could hear the busyness of conversations , the bright , Christmas-tree-ornament fragility of some girl 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other side of the wall  --  little puffy phrases popping into the gaps left between the fuller murmurings of the room . P.S. leaned forward on the step and peered around the doorframe and into the living room . Some heavy woman whose gray dress with the gold threads pressed so tightly around her rear that he could make out the seams of her girdle stood partiallyblocking his view . But beneath one dewy arm he could see all the way to the corner and the foot of the trio 's drummer tapping , tapping , tapping . Under the woman 's other arm he could see the fireplace and over her shoulder to where a **35;6193;TOOLONG through layers of dust down at the guests spilling ashes , putting wet-bottomed drinks on goodp132wood tables , laughing too loudly . In the other corner of the living room , opposite the band , was the bar and the bartenders who were just now beginning to relax after beating back the first assault from the dining room . P.S. scanned the room quickly for Hilary . He wished she would come and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him sitting alone ; but he could not see her anywhere . Couples were dancing now and there was Wally Wallace laughing with one of the bridesmaids in the middle of the floor : Wally Wallace , who had been on the Sherwood , a brandnewdestroyer-escort , which was being used all over the world to impress other nations . He had been in the Atlantic and the Pacific , sailed down the Suez and the St. Lawrence , been off Lebanonand Quemoy . The Sherwood had an exec who ran pre-dawn battle drills with all the lights on so that he could watch the men . Once , when another destroyer had blinkered , " What 's going on over there ? , " Wally had sent back , " Shuffleboard on the promenade deck . " Wally had come in while P.S. was dressing for dinner , and after the first enthusiastic back pounding and hand pumping , P.S. had felt the same uneasiness , the same shyness he had felt with Charlie . Wally had changed . He was thinner , his face had hardened , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College Weekend Beer Chug-a-Lugging Champion . P.S. had looked at him , had seen the lines around the eyes , the windburnedcheekbones , and asked him what he had been doing on the Sherwood . And Wally had n't been allowed to tell him . There had n't been time to explore and explain . It had been the same with Wally as it had with Charlie . Nobody seemed to have time , or wanted to make the time . And sitting on the stairs while the party went on around him , P.S. began to feel the familiar , insistenttug of loneliness . " Hey , you never called on me ! " a small boy protested . P.S. looked up from the stairway . The boy had the fine features of Nancy . He was wearing a clip-on bow tie with one of the clips undone so that it seemed he had a small propeller at his throat . P.S. smiled at him and said , " I never saw you . Where were you sitting ? " " I had something all prepared , " the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | " Younger or older brother ? " P.S. asked . " Younger , " he answered , obviously pleased . " Would you like me to ask the band to stop so you can give your toast now ? It would be easy to arrange . Unless you 'd rather wait . . . . Which would you prefer , Timmy ? " The boy thought for a moment . " No , I do n't think you 'd better do that . . . . Hey , listen , there 're going to be toasts tomorrow , are n't there ? At the reception and things ? " " Sure . " " Are you going to be the m.c. again ? " " You mean toastmaster ? I do n't know . " " Well , listen . I 'd probably have to make one then , too . So why do n't I just save mine for tomorrow . Would that be all right ? " " I think it would be fine . I 'll call on you first . " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get some champagne from the other toasts . " " What 's that you 've got there ? " P.S. asked . " It 's my camera . " " Are you going to be taking pictures tonight ? You any good at taking pictures ? " " Some of them turn out . Anyway , it 's fun to shoot the flash off . " " Umm . " " Hey , were you in Korea ? When you were there , did you kill anybody ? " " I do n't think so , " P.S. said . " The war was over . " " Oh . Yeah , well ... " P.S. waved good-by to the boy and then got up from the stairs and went into the living room to the edge of the dancers and cut in on Nancy . She squeezed his hand and said that she was just having the most marvelous time , that she just adored Charlie 's friends , that she was just too excited for words thinking about getting married tomorrow . P.S. did n't have to say anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would please make absolutely certain that he called them when he came to New York and would stay with them . And he said that he did n't know they were moving to New York but that she could count on his mooching a free bed every time he came in , and then he wasp134cut in on and he walked over to the bar to join Wally . " Well , whaddya say , P.S. ? " " Nothing much . " " What do you think of Nancy ? " " Very pretty little thing , is n't she ? " " Cute as a bug 's ear .... Absolutely lovely .... I told Charlie that if he should decide to chicken out I 'll smuggle that little bundle right on the Sherwood and whisk her away to enchanted isles . . . . How are you and Hilary doing ? " " Doing what ? " " Where is she ? " " I do n't know , " P.S. said . " Dancing , probably . " " I do n't see her . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . He turned around and looked into all the groups gathered at the sides of the dance floor . He did n't see her among them either , and he realized he had never seen her after the toasts . He picked up a drink for himself and a drink for her and walked out on the terrace to find her . He saw a girl standing alone out on the lawn . Her pale dress was the only thing which showed on the edge of the floodlit terrace . P.S. crossed the terrace to the lawn which was a little damp from sprinklers . He saw that it was Hilary and she had her back to him , apparently unaware of him as he approached . She continued to stand , her arms crossed , looking down at the lawn . " Hi , " P.S. said . " I brought you a drink . " " Hi , " she said . " Thanks . " He stood beside her , not speaking . Then he put his drink down on the grass and reached into his dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things ? " She nodded and took one and waited for him to light it . He lit hers and then his own . " Is there some place we can sit out of the range of these floodlights ? " " There 's a wall , " Hilary said . " A stone wall over there . " " Good . Would you like to  --  mind sitting there ? " He picked up his drink and walked with her over to the wall and sat down.  | " God , I feel so mortified , " she said . " Why ? " " Oh . . . because of my toast . . . my stupid toast ... I wanted  --  I wanted to say that I hoped they would be very happy and no matter how I tried it just did n't sound right . I mean it sounded as though Bruce and I were n't happy ... " " Are you ? " Please God , be honest . " Happy ? Yes , I suppose so . " " Well , then you 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't all that bad . My God , it was nowhere near in the same league as Nancy 's father 's toast about how Nancy wanted to know why she was n't made the same as her brothers . " " I think she and Charlie will be terribly happy . They 're absolutelyperfect for each other . " " Whatever that means . " They sat together on the stone wall in the darkness . He felt her warmth next to him , he was overwhelmingly aware of her closeness , her thigh no more than a few inches away from his , as though the air itself between them was thick with presence . He wanted to be able to talk to her , to tell her how much he had thought of her in Korea , how badly he had missed her , how much he wished she had n't married Bruce Mallory . But he did n't . He sipped his drink . Smoked his cigarette . Then he became aware that the music had stopped and he saw some people start out onto the terrace . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People are coming out and there 's no point in making them talk more than they are al-ready . " He knew that no one could see them , that they were still in the darkness , and he stood up and reached for her hand to pull her to her feet . She took his hand and started to get up , then her high heel sank into the soft grass , throwing her off balance , against him , and P.S. caught her and held her a little longer than absolutely necessary for her to regain balance , but she did n't pull away until after Nancy 's brother had taken a flash picture of them and said , " This ought a be a neat one . " " Welcome home , " Hilary said.  |p136Miss  NANCY LEE HAMMOND , daughter of Mr.and Mr. R. Taylor Hammond of Easton , Maryland , and Squam Lake , New Hampshire , was married this afternoon to Charles Merritt , son of Mr. and Mrs. Paul W. Merritt of Baltimore , Maryland . The Reverend Winthrop G. Owen , Jr. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reverend Matthew Parker III . The bride wore her mother 's wedding dress of white satin and a tulle veil fastened to an heirloom lace cap . She carried lilies of the valley , gardenias , and stephanotis . Mrs. Frazer Hempstead , the bride 's sister , was matron of honor . Other attendants were Mrs. Bruce Mallory and the Misses Alexandra Stoddard , Margaret Travers , Wendy Potter , Linda MacKenzie , and Peggy Bishop . Mr. Philip S. Wilkinson was the best man . Mrs. Merritt is a graduate of St. Timothy 's School and the ParsonsSchool of Design in New York . Her husband , a graduate of the Virginia Preparatory School , received a bachelor of arts degree in 1958 from Yale University , where he was a member of Fence Club and the Pundits . He has recently been transferred to the New York offices of Brandt &; Klein , where he is a junior account executive . The reception was held back at the Merritts ' farm , and after the rush from the church to the farm immediately following the ceremony , P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dotted with the friends of the bride and groom 's parents . And near the stone wall upon which Hilary and P.S. had sat the nightp137before , a buffet table covered with a large white linen cloth had now been set up . Two silver candelabra , at either end of the table , framed the silver serving platters of sugar-cured smoked Virginia ham , cold roast beef , slices of turkey , and salad . Flowers were set in a large silver bowl in the center of the table . The bowl had been given long ago as a wedding present to Mr. Merritt by his fellow members of Scroll and Key , the Yale secret society . P.S. looked upon it as a forceful reminder of how times had changed . Had Charlie been a member of Scroll and Key , his father would have been surprised at how much smaller the bowls given as wedding presents were now . P. S. Wilkinson , wearing his cutaway , the carnation already wilting in his lapel , saw that it would be a long , long time before Hilary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circulatedamong the guests on the lawn and carried drinks to the older women with the pale , varicose-veined legs and the floppy organdy hats , who sat beneath the oak trees on folding chairs , smiling and nodding repeatedly at nothing in particular . P.S. avoided walking up to the receiving line . He had already been kidded enough about being caught-in-the-act with Hilary . Charlie , and others , when they had come inside from the lawn and later at the rehearsal for the wedding this morning , had made sly semiserious references to the incident which indicated that even though they accepted P.S. and Hilary 's account of her heel sinkinginto the grass , they did n't entirely believe it . And after the incident , late that night in bed , P.S. had looked over at Charlie , who was asleep , who had had time for one more drink with P.S. after the party and after kidding him about Hilary had said , " Well , P.S. , how are you really ? " to which P.S. had answered , " Fine , " knowing that to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen asleep almost immediately and P.S. had wanted to talk because his earlier thoughts about the evening had changed , and he had seen that everyone was having fun , that the dinner had been a success , that all the warmth did really exist , that Charlie and his parents were so good together , and that if the chill existed , it existed only in P.S. 's mind . But that did not in any way reduce the loneliness P.S. felt ; insteadp138his despair had been intensified by the bitter truth that Hilary was , after all , married and did , after all , have a child . P.S. had lain awake that night thinking about Hilary , not understanding why she had married , why she could n't know as P.S. did that all he had needed was time . He was even a little pleased that people thought there might still be something between Hilary and himself . Had n't she held him after she slipped a little longer than necessary , or had that been just his imagination ? The receiving line was breaking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3:30 . He wondered if he would have time to see his grandmotherbefore he had to return to Washington . He knew that he damn well better make time to see his grandmother or his father would want to know why . He knew he would have to check into a hotel again , and he thought for a moment how nice it would be if he could stay just one night with Hilary . But he would not be able to leave in any case until Charlie and Nancy left the reception to catch the flight to New York and from there to Bermuda . An old lady asked him to bring her a drink , and when he returned to her she had two more friends who would like drinks also . At least it kept his mind off Hilary . When he was finally freed he strolled over to the group listening to Wally Wallace reading telegrams and he saw that he had missed seeing the cake cut . There was a telegram from Chuck Gurdey on an aircraft carrier in the Atlantic , one from Bill French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one from Fred Nelson , who was with the MAAG in Vietnam . " And here 's one from the White House . . . " Wally Wallace was saying . " It 's from the President . " The guests quieted down and looked at one another as if to say how nice it was for Mr. Eisenhower to have taken the time . " It says , Greetings . You will report no later than  --  ' " That was as far as he got before he was drowned out by laughter . P.S. looked over at Hilary . She was talking to one of the ushers . He looked at her standing there so lovely in the pale-green bridesmaid'sdress and she caught him looking at her and smiled , and he felt the effect of her smile wash over him , and he smiled back at her . Hilary excused herself from the usher and walked over to him . " Hi , " she said.  | " Hi , " P.S. answered . They stood smiling at each other for a moment . " When do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P.S. asked her . " I do n't know . Wally Wallace offered me a ride back in his car . He 's taking a couple of the bridesmaids back , but I 'm not sure when he 's leaving . " " You could drive back with me . I have a car . " " No . . . no , I do n't think I 'd better do that . " " Why ? " " Well , you know how people are .... " " Yes . Anyway , I guess I 'm beginning to find out . But I would like very much to drive you back . . . I really would . " " What time would you be leaving ? " " Well , I ca n't leave until after Charlie and Nancy leave , of course . And we 've all got to change . They wo n't be catching the plane for another hour or so . " " Nancy 's all packed . Her bags are here . I 'm sure Charlie is packed too . All they 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look nice , " he said , and then suddenly added , " Hey ! I just remembered ! Happy birthday ! " " Thank you . " " I 'd almost forgotten . Happy , happy birthday . I 'd give you a kiss on the cheek but that would just about fix us for good . " " I know . " " Listen , what are you doing about your birthday ? I mean tonight . Are you having some sort of birthday party or something ? Is there any sort of birthday celebration ? " " No . " " Well , then look . . . I know this could be kind of touchy or Not Done or whatever , but I 'd like to at least do something for your birthday . Could n't I just take you out to dinner or something some place ? We could do it here . I mean , we could go to a restauranthere in Baltimore . I 'd have to stop off and see my grandmotherfor about fifteen minutes or so , but we could do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Miller Brothers or Hausner 's . Just dinner . Nothing fancy . " He looked at her , then said ,  | " I  --  I do n't think anyone should ever be alone for the birthday . I just do n't think it 's right . " " I would n't be alone . I 'd be with the baby . " " But could n't you ask the nurse to stay longer ? I know next to nothing about babies but I do n't think I 'd want to spend a birthdaywith one even if it were mine . I think I 'd probably end up feeling terribly sorry for myself . " " No , I do n't think that would happen . " But could n't you call the nurse ? Get her to stay a little longer ? Miller Brothers is one of the great restaurants . And I 've been planning to get there for a meal ever since Korea . I used to dream about that place in Korea . We could have dinner and then drive straight to Washington . How would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten or ten-thirty and  --  and nobody would need to know . " " It 's very sweet of you , and I would like to very much . But I just do n't think we 'd better . " Sweet of me ? . . . Is that what she thinks ? " Oh , come on , Hilary . . . I 'd just like the chance to sit down and talk to you , just be with you without all these  --  all these flashbulbs and people pointing at us and thinking things or saying things . Just to be able to  --  to talk to each other . I have n't been able to talk to anyone since I 've been back . I do n't know why . But I just have n't been able to . Maybe there has n't been anyone I 've really wanted to talk to , but you . And I could talk to you . I 'd like to talk to you . It would be an enormous favor to me , and , and besides , it 's your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthday . " " I do n't know , Philip . Let me think about it , okay ? . . . Look , Charlie and Nancy have gone inside to change and I think maybe we 'd better go in there with them . " " Talk to you later ? " Hilary nodded , and they separated . P.S. went upstairs to Charlie 's bedroom . The room was filled with ushers , friends , strays , and Mr. Merritt was pouring champagne . P.S. pushed his way through to Charlie and asked him how he was feeling . " Jush terrific . . . Marvelush , " Charlie said , mock drunk.  | " I meant do you feel any different ? Do you feel married ? " P.S. had to raise his voice to make himself heard . " Not a bit . Not one iota . " " Wait until after the honeymoon , " Mr. Merritt said . " I bet you lose twenty pounds . " " Bermuda . . . God , I 'd love to go there , " P.S. said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Charlie laughed . " If I did n't have to get back to Washington , I probably would . " " Where are you staying in Washington ? " Charlie asked . " I 've got a hotel . . . " A hotel ! " Charlie said . " Why do n't you  --  Listen , I 've got a great idea . I still have my apartment in Georgetown for the next two weeks . Why do n't you stay there ? Nancy and I wo n't be back for another week and a half , and we 've both stored a lot of things in it and we 're worried about them being stolen . If you stayed there you could look out for them and have a place to stay . It would be a great relief for us . " " I do n't know what to say . . . . If you really mean that you 'd like someone to stay there it would be like a blessing from heaven . " " Of course I mean it . " Charlie rummaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address is 2908 Q Street , apartment F , can you remember that ? " P.S. wrote down the address on a scrap of paper . " You 've saved my life , old buddy . " Charlie got the key loose and handed it to him . " Well , keep out of my personal letters and underwear drawer . " " Speaking of underwear , " Mr. Merritt laughed , " you 'd better put a clean pair on . " " Oh , my God ! " Charlie said and the others laughed . Charlie put on a light summer suit and stood there suddenly looking very young and vulnerable , and then he lifted his champagne glass from on top of the bureau and said , " Thank you all very much . I want you all to know that you 've helped to make this the happiest day of my life . Thank you for coming . " Everyonesaid , " Awww ... " Charlie finished his champagne and stood beside his father and shook his father 's hand . " And you , Dad .. . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , and P.S. thought for a moment they would both cry , and he wondered whether his father and he would ever be so emotional about each other . Everyone joked and laughed and Wendy Potter came to the door and said that Nancy was ready , and Charlie went , " Gulp 1 " " Well , this is it , big fellah , " P.S. said . " We 've taken you about as far as we can . You 're on your own now . . . It 's up to the big marriage maker in the sky . " " It 's murder sending a kid out in a crate like that , " Wally said . " I talked to the squadron leader , " Charlie said . " He said everyone 's afraid their first time out . " " There goes a great guy , " P.S. said . " And his apartment . " " Get a move on , boy , " Mr. Merritt said . P.S. went downstairs and saw that the car was ready . He made it back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause at the top of the stairway . Mrs. Merritt was passing out little bags of flower petals and Mrs. Hammond was giving the guests cornflakes . P.S. could hear her saying that she was so embarrassed , she was sure she had remembered everything , but she had forgotten the rice . Nancy 's younger brother was eating the handful of cornflakes he had been given . Then Nancy threw her bouquetand Wendy Potter caught it , and Charlie threw Nancy 's blue garter , and none of the ushers made any move to catch it . It dropped to the floor and some of the older guests went " Ohhh ! " until it was explained to them that none of the ushers was particularlyeager to get married  --  at least not immediately . Then Nancy and Charlie ran down the stairs and raced out of the house under the storm of cornflakes and flower petals . Mrs. Merritt and Mrs. Hammond cried , neither attempting nor wanting to console the other , and P. S. Wilkinson went back through the covering of cornflakes and flowers , feeling sad for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went upstairs to Charlie 's bedroom to change out of his cutaway and into his suit . When he had finished with his good-bys and had assured the ushers that he would keep in touch with them he looked around for Hilary . But she was n't there and he felt a little sickp143when he realized how much he had wanted dinner with her tonight . He picked up his suitcase and carried it around the back of the house where he had parked his rented car . He opened the back door to put it in and saw Hilary sitting in the front seat . " Hi , " he said . " I thought you 'd gone . " " No . " " Thank God . I 'm so glad you did n't . " He walked around to the front of the car and slid in next to her . " Do you have everything ? Your suitcase , things like that ? " " Yes . I did n't bring much . " " Then let 's be off . " He drove around to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the driveway past the people still standing around on the lawn , Hilary slumped down in the seat so that she would n't be seen . P.S. wondered whether she had been right to do that , whether it did n't make their going off together different from what he wanted . And then they were out of the driveway , onto the road to Baltimore , and Hilary sat up again . She was silent for a while and then she said , " Look , maybe you 'd better drop me off at the railroad station . I do n't think I should have done this . " " Oh , relax , Hilary , " P.S. said . " There 's not a thing wrong with what we 're doing . It 's two old friends going to dinner together on your birthday and afterwards we 'll drive straight home to Washington . " " Do you think anyone saw me ? " " So what ? . . . Anyway , unless they saw you get in the car , no one saw you . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed thinly . " You make me feel like some sort of counterspy . " Hilary did not speak again until they came to Charles Street . Then she said , " Your family has a house here , do n't they ? " " It 's further on . We go right by it . I 'll show it to you . " They continued driving in silence until Hilary sort of twisted so that she was sitting sideways in the seat with her knees tucked beneath her and she patted his hand and said , " I 'm glad I came . "  | " So am I. So am I. We 'd better start looking for a parking space . My grandmother lives in that apartment building up ahead . " " There 's one . . . . No , that 's a hydrant . There 's one though , I think . " P.S. parked the car and turned off the ignition . " Would you like to come up with me and see my grandmother ? " " I do n't think so . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides , I 'd just get in the way . No , I think you 'd be better off if you went alone . " ' Well , maybe so .... I 'll leave the key in the ignition . If you want to listen to the radio or something just turn it on . It 's a rented car , so there 's no telling what you 'll find in the glove compartment . Probably rate cards and things to do in case of accidents . " " I 'll be fine . " " I wo n't be long . " " Good , " Hilary said . P.S. got out of the car and walked along the sidewalk toward the apartment building . On the way he wondered whether or not he should have insisted that Hilary come up . He had the feeling that he was not in control of their relationship , that somehow whatever was happening was predetermined to happen in spite of him . He knew the sensitiveness of this situation . Was she , by staying in the car , by ducking down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen , by placing this emphasis upon the furtiveness of their relationship , accepting the moral judgmentsothers had placed on their seeing each other ? And , further , was she then by staying for dinner with him admitting her willingness  --  indeed , committing herself  --  to having an af-fair ? He took the elevator up to his grandmother 's floor and rang the doorbell at her apartment . The colored maid answered the door and said , ' Why , Mr. Philip , how nice to see you again . Please . . . Come right in . . . My word , how you 've grown ! " " Hello , Francine , " he said . " How is my grandmother ? " " She 's just fine . She 'll be so pleased to see you . Is she expecting you ? "  | " I do n't think she even knows I 'm back in the country , " he said . " I 've just gotten back from a wedding and I wanted to see her before I left Baltimore . " " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandson , Mrs. Wilkinson , it 's Mr. Philip . " " Philip ? " " Yes 'm . " " Send him in here . " " Yes 'm . Please go right in , Mr. Philip . " " How is she , Francine ? Would it be all right if I stayed about ten minutes ? " " You 'll be able to tell when she gets tired . Can I bring you some milk and cookies ? " " No , thanks , " he said . " I do n't think so . " He walked into the living room and saw his grandmother sitting with her back to him in the high stuffed chair she had been sitting in for as long as he could remember . He came around the side of her chair and saw her hands , swollen with arthritis , lying half-hidden under a shawl in her lap . " Hi , Grandma , " he said . " How are you ? " He leaned forward and kissed her . " My word , Philip ! You smell like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wedding . " He pulled up a chair and sat down opposite her . " Oh , well , that 's fine then . How is that nice boy ? His parents were kind enough to invite me to the wedding , but I 'm getting just too old to go to those things any more . " " It was a nice wedding . You should have been there . You might have enjoyed it . " He smiled at her . " You 've already noticed how freely the wine flowed . " " That 's not wine on your breath . But never mind . I like it . " " So do I. Now , I want you to tell me , really . I have n't seen you in more than a year . How are you ? " " Well , I 'm not about to die , if that 's what you mean . " " That 's exactly what I meant . You promised to leave me that mahogany captain 's chest in your will , and now that I 'm about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wondering when I could collect . "  |p146The  old lady pursed her wrinkled lips and rustled her hands in her lap and pretended to tremble slightly . " I suppose I could give it to you now , " she said , then gave a prolonged sigh . " That is , if you really want it . " P.S. watched her . He loved this act of hers . She would suddenlychange into a helpless , doddering , unloved , forlorn old woman to trick him into being ashamed of himself . And as soon as she would trap him into abject apologies , she would just as swiftly burst into laughter and harass him for being so gullible . But he had been away for a long time . Could she have changed in a year ? He decided to risk her being the same and said , " Look , I 've got a car outside . I could pick up the chest now and take it out with me . " " Oh , no , you wo n't ! " She laughed . Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Philip . . . Philip , at times you 're so much like your dear grandfather that it frightens me . " " That 's a very great compliment . " " Not so great . He was a rascal , a terrible rascal . Someone who would take advantage of old ladies just like you . " P.S. waited , giving her time to remember . And then he said , " I 'm sorry I never knew him better . " " He was a fine man . He certainly never forgot you ! Do you know what you did the first time he held you ? You could n't remember , of course . I doubt that you were more than three months old at the time ... " P.S. knew the story , but he listened anyway . " He picked you up and said , My , what a fine-looking boy you are ! ' and you threw up on him . I wish you could have seen the look on your mother 's face , she was horrified . But your grandfathersaid , There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes right after his father . ' " " I 'm afraid I still do , " he said . " Well , you two look a little alike . Of course you look like your mother , too . Now , tell me . I know that Korea was dreadful , so we wo n't talk about it . Let 's talk instead about what you plan to do . " " I 'm not sure , Grandma , " he said , " I was thinking of working for the government . "  | " Yes , that would be nice . Your great-grandfather , as you know , was Ambassador to Italy . And your great-uncle Coulter was a delegate to the treaty of something or other . And , let 's see , your cousin Tucker is in the Diplomatic Corps now . " " Well , it 's a good place to work . " " It 's an honorable place to work . " " Umm . " " Have you heard from your father ? " " No , not yet . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Can I leave my address with you ? I 'll be staying at Charles Merritt 's apartment . I 'll write it down and leave it with Francine . When he gets back I know he 'll call you . Anyway , I 'm sure we 'll get in touch when he returns . " P.S. looked at his watch and stood up . " I 'm afraid I have to go now . I 've got someone waiting for me in the car . " " But why did n't you bring her up ? " " How did you know it was a her ' ? " " Now , Philip , I may be old , but I 'm not foolish . " She smiled at him . " Do I know her ? " " I do n't think so . I did n't bring her up because I had n't seenyou in such a long time , and I thought it would probably beboring for her to have to sit and listen to us talk family talk . " " But it was wrong for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You should n't have done that  --  unless you 're ashamed of her . " " Good heavens , no ! She 's a girl I knew at college and I said I would drive her back to Washington after the wedding . " " Are you interested in her ? " " You mean am I in love with her ? I just got back from Korea a week ago . I have n't had time to see anybody , much less fall in love with someone . " " Well , bring her to meet me next time . " " I will , Grandma . I will , " he said . He kissed his grandmother on the cheek again , and said , " Take care of yourself . " " Got nothing better to do , " she answered . He could see she was tired and he left the apartment quickly and rode the elevator down and walked out onto the sidewalk . He saw Hilary still sitting in the car and he waved to her , then looked away from her and at the cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he climbed in . " I 'm sorry I took so long , " he said . " The only way I could get out was to tell her that I had a lovely young lady waiting in the car for me . She told me I should have brought you up with me . That would have given Baltimore something to talk about . My grandmother loves to gossip . " " I could have slipped off my wedding ring , " Hilary said . " She never would have known the difference . " " I never would have thought of that , " P.S. said . And he felt a little stunned that it had occurred to her , and then elated . He started the engine and pulled out into the traffic and continued down Charles Street . " That 's Carter Hall up ahead . Behind the hedges . It 's the old family house . Sort of vintage Charles Addams , but not bad inside . " " It 's enormous , is n't it ? " " I wish I could take you inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be better off not seeing for the moment , and anyway , I 've got to get you some dinner if we 're to get you to Washington at the proper time . " " You do n't really have to take me to dinner , you know . I mean we could drive straight down to Washington . " " Let 's not start that again . I said I 'd take you to dinner and I meant it . " They bypassed the monument to George Washington and turned up Lafayette Street to the top of the hill , then parked in the garage opposite where they would eat . Hilary took his arm as they crossed the street , and they entered Miller Brothers ' restaurant . " I like the dining room to the left the best , " he said . " It has all these marvelous signs in it  --  signs about Baltimore Firsts , like the first statue to George Washington was erected in Baltimoreon such-and-such a date . Or the first ice-cream machine was made in Baltimore , or the first balloon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one I like best is the one that says that the first underwater ship of commerce landed in Baltimore harbor in something like 1916 . And the painting shows this German U-boat , and you know damn wellp149that that sub was there to photograph the harbor installations .... I have n't been in here since I was stationed here with the Army , I mean outside Baltimore . " The headwaiter came over and showed them to a table and took their orders for drinks . P.S. sat opposite Hilary and looked at her . " I 'm very happy you came , " he said , feeling that he had said it already a hundred times . " I 'm glad , too . " They busied themselves folding and unfolding their napkins , moving the silverware , smoothing the white tablecloth , and then their drinks came , and P.S. lifted his glass and said , " To you . " " You , too , " she said , and she smiled at him over her glass and he tried to smile but all he could think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her again . P. S. Wilkinson sipped his drink , then put it down . " You really look so lovely , Hilary . . . I guess this new life must be suiting you . " " It is . " " That 's good . . . Well , that was quite a wedding , " he said . " I thought it went very smoothly . " " It was a nice wedding . " There was a long pause and then Hilary asked , " Do you think you 'll be living in Washington ? " " I do n't know . I 'd like to . I like Washington better than any other city . But I do n't know . If , if I do this thing with the government , then I 'll have to live in Washington . But I do n't  --  if I do n't get the job , then I do n't know where I 'll live . Maybe New York . " " What do you want to do ? " " You mean what kind of job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really want to do more than anything else in the world ... . I guess maybe we 'd better order . My sister , Page , when we were little always used to say that I talked too much . She used to say to me , Babble on , little brook , babble on . ' I never knew what the hell she was talking about . I thought she was saying Babylon , that place in the Bible  --  also Long Island .. .  | " We had better order , " Hilary said . P.S. signaled to the waiter . They ordered a bucket of steamers to be split between them , pompano , a Chablis served in chilled glasses , and for dessert , Cranshaw melons . The clams arrived , a bit gritty but good , and they settled down to the ritual of dipping the clams in the broth , in the butter , biting off the necks , piling the empty shells on the plates . P.S. paused and asked , " Are you a good cook ? " " No . I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cook . But Bruce does n't care what he eats . He 's happy to eat hamburgers . " " Not me . God , I love food . I 'm grateful I 'm so thin . I can eat as much as I want . You know what ? " " What ? " " This meal we 're having . I 've had this meal planned for over a year . I ca n't tell you how many times I thought about having this meal while I was in Korea . " " You wanted what we 're having now ? " " Exactly . " Even to the point of being with you . " Then this sort of makes it a special occasion for you , too . " " I know . " He ate another clam . " What are you now , twenty-one ? " " Umm-hmm , " she nodded . She was struggling with the neck of a clam . " You always seemed so much older than me . I know that they say women mature faster than men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet I always felt like some sort of little boy with you . " But I was in love with you . " " I was in love with you , too . I 've often wondered why we did n't work out . " Oh , for God 's sake , Wilkinson ! " You mean why am I married to someone else ? " " I guess so , " he said . " No , look , that 's none of my business . I just want to say  --  let me lay a little ground rules , here . I really did love you , Hilary . . . I loved you more than anything else in the world  --  anyone in the world . We spent a lot of time together and I 'd like to think that we know each other pretty well , anyway a lot better than most people know each other . And I do n't wantp151to have to forget it , pretend that it did n't happen . Oh , God , I keep sounding like a bad movie or something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are n't we ? " " Yes . " Oh , God damn it ! Why do I sound so much like some awful , pimply-faced teen-ager whose best girl in the whole wide world has just told him that she 's terribly , terribly sorry but she 's fallen in love with the football captain , some bastard with tiny hips and a big chest , and although she thinks the debating team is terribly important , she is sure he will understand that it just is n't the same any more between them , and would he mind if they were just good friends ? ... " Hilary , all I want  --  all I want is not to lose you again  --  even lose you just as a friend . " " Okay . " " I 've got a few clams left , do you want some more ? " She shook her head , " No , thanks . " " You know what ? I 'm finally , really beginning to be able to relax . To be sort of , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you mean . I feel the same way . I 'm glad we can relax with each other , I 'm glad that other business is all over with . " It was the way she had said it that disturbed him , and he asked , " Why glad ? " " Because . . . you made me so goddam unhappy ! " she blurted . " Do you remember when we announced our engagement ? And the next week you called it off ? And I was so . . . I felt awful , so ... SO USED . And I hated it . I hated you ! I felt as though I were groveling . " " My God , Hilary , but why ? I never knew I made you feel that way . " " Oh , well , forget it , Philip , it does n't matter any more . It 's over with . " " Are you sorry ? " " Sorry it 's over ? " " No  --  oh , hell , I guess that is what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no right asking it . Forget it . " " Well , then , I 'll say this much , Philip . I 'm glad that it hap/pened , that we did love each other , and I 'm not sorry it 's over . " P.S. laughed awkwardly . " This is so awful . All I 've wanted to do this weekend is talk to you  --  and now that we 're finally alone I ca n't say what I want to say . I do n't know why  --  it 's maybe because I 'm so much like my father in some ways , but I always feel so goddam self-conscious when I 'm trying to talk to someone , to be honest about something . It 's the words themselves in a way . I ca n't seem to keep from seeing my self sitting back  --  as though I were a separate self , one of me watching the other . And when one of me says something like I want to be serious , ' the other of me always sees it as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , But seriously , ' with a comma . And then , without fail , I always bog down and become inarticulate . But the point is that I do want to be serious with you , and I ca n't help it if it 's such an awful word . " They ate silently for a few more minutes , and P.S. sipped his Chablis and cleared his throat , and then he said , " Okay , I 'm starting again . Now . First . To begin with ... I still love you . Now quick before I go any further let me explain , okay ? " He saw that she was looking at him . He took another piece of pompano , swallowed , sipped his Chablis , lined up the glass with his butter plate , straightened his knife alongside the spoon . " Oh , God , not like we were in college , I mean , I ca n't , I 'm not allowed to love you the same any more  --  no matter how much I would like to . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some way . . . I still sound like some awful teen-ager with sweaty palms . " " No , no , " she said . She reached over and touched his hand . " Anyway , " she said , " your palm is dry . Please , do n't spoil it . " " We ca n't . It 's so nice , just to have someone to talk to . I used to go batty in Korea because there was no one to talk to . I was so damn lonely because of that . In Korea I could never be myself , I always had to be  --  to pretend to be someone , something different . I had to be a soldier , an officer , a sort of professional killer and things like that , and I was always forced to behave like an officer , And all I really ever wanted to do was talk , was toready ?  --  here'sthat awful word : com-mun-i-cate . . . And then , when I got back , I could n't at home and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much to honestly talk to me and therep153just did n't seem to be time . And now , to have someone I love , sittingacross the table from me , eating this delicious meal , makes all the difference in the world , do you see what I mean ? I want to catch up with you , and find out what you 've been doing . What everybody 's been doing since I 've been away ... " " Well , I got married , and I have a child . " " That 's quite a lot , " he said gently . " Well , yes . It is . It should be the greatest thing in the world . Fulfillment of the woman 's role . But it is n't all that exciting . " " Did you ever  --  you know I thought a lot about you this past year . " " I thought about you , too . " " You know what happened once ? This is going to sound so childish . But once , one night in Korea , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korea , about three feet deep , with some step to sit on , all tile  --  anyway , I borrowed this other lieutenant 's soap , and I used it , and suddenly I felt sort of sick , because I recognized the smell . It was the soap you used to use . I never knew it was the soap that made you smell this way , I just thought that was the way you smelled . And that one smell was yours , and it should n't belong to some bar of soap . And there I was , up to my chin in this tub , smelling this bar of soap , holding it under my nose , and it was you . You know how it 's impossible to remember how someone you really know looks ? You ca n't remember what they look like , because you can never really look at them without all kinds of associations . But there in Korea , I had an absolutely crystal-clear perfect picture of you . And I missed you so terribly much right then . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I had no right to think of you at all . Anyway the next day I went to the PX and bought some of that soap , just so that I could think of you and remember you and I even  --  once I slept with a bar of that soap under my pillow so that I would dream of you . " Hilary would not look at him . She kept her face turned away and hid her eyes behind her hand . She shook her head slowly back and forth and then , when she finally uncovered her eyes and looked at him , P.S. could see the tears . " Oh , Hilary , I 'm so sorry , " he said . " I did n't mean to upset you . "  |p154She  shook her head again . " Hey , listen , this is supposed to be your birthday party ! " He picked up his glass of Chablis and tipped it toward her . " Happy birthday , Hilary , and I hope you have many , many more and that they 'll all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank you for giving me this dinner , thank you for bringing me here . " She leaned across the table toward him and brushed her hand across his and squeezed his lightly . " Thank you for giving me the nicest birthday party I 've ever had . " He opened his mouth and wanted to tell her he loved her but then she said , " This is a nice restaurant . I like it . If Bruce and I ever come up to Baltimore I 'll make him take me to dinner here . " P.S. felt the jealousy and knew she saw it . The melons came and she and P.S. ate in silence , and then P.S. looked up at her and said , " Forgive me , I 'm sorry . I ca n't seem to get away from acting stupidly . " " Do n't  --  " she said , not finishing her sentence . He put aside his melon , then drank his coffee . He drank the whole cup without stopping , then put the cup down in its saucer and placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be finished in a minute , " Hilary said . " Take your time . " " No , I 'll finish . I can remember you were always so impatient when I took a long time over my coffee . " " No , that 's changed . The Army and its endless coffee breaks has changed that . Please . Take as long as you want . It 's nice sitting back and being able to look at you . " " What time is it ? " P.S. looked at his watch , " Around a quarter to nine . " " I guess we had better get going . " " We have plenty of time . It 's only about forty-five minutes to Washington , an hour at the most . " He poured himself another cup of coffee . " See ? There 's plenty of time . No hurry . " Hilary sipped her coffee and P.S. drank his . The second cup was cool , and tasted like dirt . " I 've finished , " Hilary said.  | " Would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , nothing for me . " P.S. paid the check and got up to help Hilary out of her chair . As they left the restaurant and crossed the street Hilary again took his arm and pressed it to her , and said , " Thank you , dear Philip , for a wonderful evening . " " I love  --  " he started . " I loved having you . " The Baltimore-Washington Expressway was surprisingly uncrowdedin spite of its being a Saturday night . P. S. Wilkinson was able to keep the car at a good speed , five miles faster than the limit . It was quiet inside the car , quiet within the night , the night broken only by the sweep of his car 's headlights . Hilary sat curled up on the other side of the seat , far away from P.S. , resting her arm and her head on the back of the seat . Every now and then P.S. would look over at her , see her in the dim light of the glowing dashboard instruments , see the whiteness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lips darkened by the dim light . He liked her sitting away from him . There was no need for them to sit close together like two teen-agers racing home from the double feature horror show at the drive-in . He felt no need to touch her , speak to her . He was happy that she was with him . And he knew that this must be what marriage was like . Ahead was his favorite curve on this road , a long open parenthesis to the right , where the tall dark trees framed the road . He pretended he was a racing driver , his arms taut against the wheel , his body and the automobile fused into one perfectly functioning machine . He had thought about this curve , too , in Korea , thinking what he would be doing , whom he would be with , where he would be going when he came into this curve again . He would be back in the States . He would be on his way to Washington . He would be having a good time . Knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the speed limit slowed to show that the driver was approaching Washington . He wondered if he could explain this feeling to Hilary , could make her understand what this curve meant to him , why it was something special . And he wondered if other people had their favorite curves . Whether , when they lovedp156a place , they did not think of the place but of some part of the road leading into it like he did . He looked over at Hilary and thought she might be asleep , and he went into the curve , leaning slightly with the car , wanting to whistle or smile or laugh , and then the curve straightened out and he settled back , still very happy . He wondered what Charlie and Nancy were doing now . Maybe they were just finishing dinner and wanting to go to bed and Charlie would be nervous and saying something like , " You know , we do n't have to make love tonight , unless you want to . " And then Nancy would be put in the awkward position of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from what P.S. had seen of Nancy , he thought she would want to do very much indeed . And P.S. smiled again in the anticipation of their first night 's confusion , and tenderness , and love . He slowed the car and Hilary stirred and stretched . Her arm touched the back of M. 's neck and he jumped slightly . She moved so that her fingers could massage his neck muscles . " Scare you ? " she asked . " No , no . I guess I was about a hundred miles away . " He felt her fingers on the back of his neck and he liked them there and felt guilty and bothered and hated himself for not feeling that it was a natural gesture on her part  --  a gesture in friendship , not as a prelude to anything else , that she was massaging his neck muscles because she felt he might be tired of driving . " You were smiling to yourself a moment ago , " she said . " Why ? " " I was just very happy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of reasons . Charlie and Nancy , I was thinking about the two of them . I 'm happy for them . And I 'm happy about being out of the Army . And I 'm happy because of that curve in the road we just took . And I 'm especially happy being with you . I guess it 's just that for the first time in I do n't know how long I 'm very , very happy . " " So am I. " " Any particular reason for you ? " " I 'm just very happy . " " Good , " he said , disappointedly . They drove again in silence.  |p157And  then he thought what a horrible thing it would be if the two of them were killed in a car accident . If he and Hilary were suddenlysplashed across the road , and people would find them , and then there would be all sorts of talk . Someone would find out that they had had dinner together at Miller Brothers and one of the waiters would say something like , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He slowed the car down and tried to think about something else . " We 're almost there , " Hilary said . They could see the lights of Washington ahead . " Hilary ? ... " " Hmm ? " " Can we have lunch together in Washington sometime ? " " I do n't know . I do n't know if we should . " " I was afraid of that . " " I did n't say I did n't think we should see each other . I just said I do n't know if we should see each other . I would like to see you . " " I 'd like to see you , too . " " Well , we 'll have to wait until Bruce returns . I want you to meet Bruce . You 'll like him . " The hell I will . " Well , I 'd like to meet him , too , " he said , " but do you really think he would mind if we saw each other ? My God , I know I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit like you . You two are entirely different . I think you 'll like each other . " " I hope so . I 'm told he 's a terrific guy . " Oh , shit . " Terrific guy ' ? Yes , I suppose he is . " " When does he get back ? " " I do n't know . He 's down in South Carolina looking at a plant site . He 's with Massey-Prewitt and they 're thinking of building a new plant in South Carolina , not far from Aiken . He said it might take about a week . " " A week ? When did he leave ? " " Yesterday . He flew down to be there for the weekend . That 's the way business is these days . He spends a weekend at the country club playing golf with the people , drinking with them , smiling at their daughters , then they get around to business at the start of the week . "  | " Sounds pretty pleasant . I mean a pleasant way to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Actually I do n't know  --  oh , never mind . " " Never mind what ? " " Nothing , " she said . Then , after a moment , " Look , Philip , I 'm not fooling you any . Bruce and I are n't as wild about each other as I try to pretend . I do n't know why , but it has n't worked out . " He felt as though his stomach had exploded , as though the car should have swerved off the road , as though Hilary would have been knocked senseless by the impact of her words upon him . " In what way ? " he asked cautiously . I want to know everything ! Everything that bastard has done wrong ! " I 'm not going to bore you with it , " she said . " Sometimes these things just happen . So what if everything is n't roses ; that 's what happens sometimes . " " I guess so , " he said , wondering how she could sound so tough . " I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once he can relax a little from his work , things will be all right between you . I 'm sure he works very hard . " " He does . He 's their golden boy . ' He 'll probably be president of Massey-Prewitt by the time he 's thirty-five . " " God , I hope not ! " P.S. laughed . " I 'd hate to see anyone my age be that successful . " " Well , he 's very ambitious , " she said . " In fact , he kind of frightened me when we first met . I mean he knew exactly what he wanted to do and how long it would take him to do it . You know what he wrote his thesis on ? The importance of industrial plant sites in the relationship between labor costs and its influence in the community . It attracted quite a lot of attention . They were even thinking of publishing it . " " Who 's they ' ? " " Massey-Prewitt . That 's why he got such a good job with them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one I did on the relationshipbetween child and nature in Wordsworth . I do n't know anybody who 'd want to publish that . In fact , my English professorwrote on it , Your style is frequently barbaric . ' Maybe I could get someone to publish his comments . "  | " Massey-Prewitt might like the nature ' part of it . " " I doubt it . " P. S. Wilkinson found a parking place not far from Hilary 's house . He looked at his watch . Ten-o-seven . That 's about the time I promised , is n't it ? " " It 's fine , " she said . " And thank you , Philip . I had a lovely time . " " I did , too . " She made no move to get out of the car . " What about the nurse ? Does she have a way home ? " " She 'll sleep in tonight . " " Oh , okay . I was going to offer to drive her home , but since there 's no need . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Okay . " " I wish I could ask you in for a drink , but I 'd better not ... . There 's just myself and the nurse and Hester . " " No , do n't worry about it . It 's fine . I do n't think I could drink anything more anyway . " " Well ... " Would you like a cigarette ? " " No , thank you . I guess I 'd better be going ... " " I can walk you to the door . " " No , that 's all right . Do n't bother . " " It 's no bother . " " Then maybe you 'd just better not . " " You mean because someone might see us ? " " No , it 's not that . " " Then what is it ? " " Someone would come along and see us , " she admitted . P.S. laughed . " Oh , for God 's sake . So what ? They 'd think here is a friend walking you home . Period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bruce 's is dropping you off , that 's all . " " Well , okay . I do n't like walking around alone in the night anyway , " " God knows you 're safe in Georgetown . " " You used to be , but I just get nervous now . So let 's go . "  | " Okay . " P.S. opened his door and stepped out , then he walked around the back of the car and opened Hilary 's door and helped her out . He glanced away so that he would n't be caught looking at her legs . He walked beside her not speaking for the half block to her door , and stood slightly behind her while she fished through her pocketbook for her keys . " I hope you have n't lost them , " he said . " If I have to go around sneaking through windows , then the neighbors will have something to talk about . " " I 've got them , " she said . She pulled out a small red leather key case and opened it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the street lamp . " Here 's the one . " She pushed the key into the lock and turned it , partially opening the front door . " Well .. . Good night , Phil . " He stood there , wanting to kiss her good night . Not on the lips , but just a gentle kiss on the cheek . But she was facing the wrong way , and he knew that it would be awkward and that he 'd probably mess it up . And yet he certainly did n't want to just shake hands with her . He reached out to touch her arm and when he touched her , she jumped slightly , and laughed nervously . " The electric touch of P. S. Wilkinson ... " " I did n't mean to scare you . " " You did n't . " " Umm . " He stood there with his hands now pushed deep into his pockets . " Well ... " " Good night , Philip , I 'm glad you 're home . " " Me , too , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " She paused for a moment , then smiled . " Yes , do that . Please . " He waited for her to close the door behind her , and then he walked back up the block to his car . He sat there for a moment , smoking a cigarette , then he pulled out of the parking place and drove slowly toward her house . He could see a light on upstairs now , and wondered if that was her bedroom . Then he saw her shadow move across the shade , and he drove on past her house and across Georgetown to Charlie Merritt 's apartment.  |p161SUNDAY  MORNING P. S. Wilkinson awoke late and it took him a few moments to realize where he was . And then he got up , walked into the living room and sat down at the desk . He looked up Hilary 's number in the telephone book , and dialed . After a few moments he said , " Hilary ? Hi . It 's P.S. . . . Oh , fine , very nice . Once I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , what I 'm calling about is lunch . How about some lunch ? ... Well , you could bring her along . Put her in a box or something . . . . I see , well , I ... Oh , no , I could n't do that . It 's a lot of trouble ... . No , really . . . . Well . . . You 're sure now ? It 's not too much trouble ? Well , what about the neighbors ? . . . " P.S. laughed . " Okay , I 'll walk on over . I think I can find you again . If not , I 'll take a cab . I might take a cab anyway , it 's so hot . . . Fine , fifteen minutes . . . Sure . . . G'by  --  no , wait , Hilary ? . . . Hilary ? Is there anything you need ? Something I can bring ? . . . You 're sure ? ... Okay , ' by . " As he entered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was entering a situation of impressive and melodramatic proportions . He was fully aware of the various interpretations one might place upon his going to Hilary 's home while her husband was away . P.S. knew that during the past night 's dinner and drive back to Washington he had fallen in love with her again  --  but in the cold light of the rational morning he knew that the love he felt now was not quite so unrealistic.  |p162She  was , after all , married , and she did , after all , have a child , and he had been , after all , gone a long , long time , and he was , after all , lonely . And as he sat there in the cab he saw himself simultaneously cast in the roles of good friend of the ex-girl , the bitter ex-fiance seeking revenge , the ex-girl 's husband 's cuckold , and the nice young man with whom the good wife cheats . He was , therefore , more than willing to accept the risk of discovery and compromise and reprisal merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also knew , however , that he was not at all sure how he would behave should Hilary wish that he become more than an old friend and , rather , become  --  What does she want meto become ? he asked himself . She was certainly eager or at least willing for me to come to her place . . . . As the cab turned ontoher street , P.S. had a sudden vision of Hilary meeting him at the door clad in a near-transparent negligee . She would quickly close the door behind him saying , " I could n't wait any longer , " and he would answer " What was the number of that house again ? " the cab driver asked . " That 's the one . " P.S. pointed . " The red brick with the ivy on the right . " P.S. paid the driver and crossed to the front door and pushed the doorbell . He looked around to ' see if anyone else was on the street , and then he looked across the street at the houses on the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He heard someone walking toward the door and he checked the pocket flaps on his suit coat to make sure they were out , and the door opened . Hilary was wearing shorts and a blouse . " Hi , Hilary , " he said . " Come in quick , before the house heats up . " He stepped inside and stopped in the hallway while Hilary shut the door . " Well , how are you ? " he asked . " Fine . Hot . " " How 's Hester ? " " She 's sleeping . I just fed her . " She saw P.S. looking at her breast . " Bottle . Bottle fed her . " P.S. blushed slightly and laughed.  | " Well ... well , where would you like to sit ? The living room 's the coolest . I 'm not fixing us anything special for lunch . Bacon , lettuce and tomato . That 's all right , is n't it ? " " Fine , " P.S. said , nodding . " Perfect . " " Good . Then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch . " " Let me help you . " " There 's nothing to do . " " Well , ca n't I come into the kitchen and watch ? " " It 's a mess . I would n't want you to see it . I still have all the things from breakfast . " " Oh , for God 's sake , I 'm not running an inspection . Why do I have to sit in another room ? I 'd rather be with you . " " Okay then , come ahead . " She led him into the kitchen . " Do you want butter or mayonnaise on your sandwich ? " " Whatever 's easier , " he said . Hilary looked at him for a moment . " Do you want butter or mayonnaise ? They 're both as hard to spread . " " Mayonnaise . " " Do you want your sandwich on toast or bread ? " " Toast , dear . " P.S. smiled . " My God , you 're pretty tough in the kitchen , are n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mind , Buster . You want mayonnaise or butter ? Toast or plain bread ? One , two , three ! ' " " I ca n't stand it when people ca n't make up their minds . " " I was just being nice . " " Well , do n't be nice . " " Do n't be nice ? What do you want me to do ? Grab the sandwichfrom you and belt you one in the chops ? " " All I want you to do is to tell me what you want . " " Peace and quiet , and happiness ever after . " Hilary laughed then , and P.S. walked over to hug her and chickened out before he got to her . " You seem nervous as a cat , " he said . " I could n't sleep last night , " she said . " And when you told me on the phone you slept well I wondered  --  " " I never said that . You asked me how my night was and I said , Fine once I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth , I sleptp164lousy . It took me until around two o'clock not ? " " Well , it was n't because of the heat . " " You mean because of us ? " P.S. asked . " Eat your sandwich , " she said . They sat at the kitchen table and ate in silence for a moment . " What 's Charlie 's apartment like ? " Hilary asked . " Oh , " P.S. laughed , " maybe a little sweet . Nancy told me he got it from some fag interior decorator . It 's got the wildest curtains . They 're bright red corduroy and they kind of swirl and droop and swish to the floor . " " How big is the apartment ? " " Living room-bedroom-kitchenette . It 's not very big , but then I do n't need anything bigger . It 's about the same size as my room was at college . Anyway , since Charlie said I could have it for the next two weeks it 'll give me a place to stay while I figure out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I thought that was settled . I thought you did want to live in Washington . " " Well , I do . But I certainly ca n't live here without a job . Until I get a job there 's no point in getting an apartment . " " Oh , " Hilary said . P.S. looked at Hilary . He tried to imagine himself married to her and having lunch across the table any time . " This is kind of nice , " he said . " Well , we 're going to put in some more cupboards . " " Oh , for God 's sake , I 'm not talking about your kitchen . " P.S. laughed . " Here I am trying to inject a little romance into our lunch and what do I get ? Good Housekeeping ! " " Well , it is nice , " Hilary said . " You must come to lunch more often . " " Good God , " P.S. said , " is this my fault ? " " Is what your fault ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have to tell me , " Hilary said , " I 'm acting like the perfect bitch . " " Why ? Because you did n't sleep ? "  | " No , no , not that . " " Well , then , why ? " he asked . " Unless it 's none of my business or you 'd rather not tell me . " " No , it 's Bruce . He called this morning and said that it looks like he 's going to have to stay in South Carolina longer than he expected . " " Well , that 's good news , is n't it ? I mean , you said last night that everything was n't too great between the two of you . I should think a little time away from each other would be good . " " Not if he 's with some little . dewy-eyed Southern belle it is n't . " " What makes you think he is ? " " He just sounded funny on the phone , that 's all . " " Funny how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You have to live with someone before you know what I mean . " P.S. was quiet . He knew that this was not the time for him to remind Hilary that she had lived with him , too . " Did you have enough to eat ? " she asked . " There 's plenty more . " " Fine , thanks , " he said , " I might take another glass of iced tea . " " He'p yo'se'f , " she said . " Thang kew veddy much . " He poured himself another glass and set it down on the kitchen table . " Let 's go sit in the living room . " " Whatever you say , Fang . " P.S. followed Hilary back through the dining room , across the hallway , and into the living room . He wondered whether Hilary would sit on the couch . If she did , would he sit next to her ? Hilary sat on the couch , and P.S. sat on a chair opposite her . He watched Hilary lift a cigarette from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their wedding engraved upon it . She tapped the cigarette on top of the box , then picked up the table lighter . She flicked the lighter several times , then put it back down on the table . P.S. reached over and held his lighter for her . She took the light , gently touching his hand as he did so . " Thanks , " she said . He watched Hilary inhale , then quickly blow the smoke out ,  |p166and  he said , " Look , if this is a bad day for you , I could go and we could forget about today entirely . " " No , do n't go , Phil . Not yet . " " Well , I 'd like to stay , but if you do n't feel well ... " " I 'm fine . " He wished he knew what to do . He wished there were some way he could get her to relax , to be happy , or at least pleasant . He hated not being able to comfort her . He remembered at collegewhen she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they had made it safely through another month . Hilary lifted her legs onto the coffee table and leaned back on the couch . From the way she was sitting her shorts were pulled tight around her and he could not help but look . P.S. forced himself to look away . " What do people in Washingtondo to keep cool on days like this ? " " Either they leave town or they never move away from the air conditioners . " " Where do they go to , Rehobeth Beach ? " " Unless they 've got a summer place somewhere else , " Hilary said . " Or you get to know someone with a swimming pool . " " Who do you know who has a swimming pool ? " " Well , a couple of people . But I do n't like to go there on the weekend since that 's the only time the husband has a chance to use it himself . " " Very thoughtful . " " Yes , it is . " " Yes . " " Well ... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " P.S. asked . " I feel like we were blind dates or something . I feel like we just met at a dance . You know ? Where do you go to school ? ' " " Farmington , " she answered . " Oh , really ? Do you like it there ? " " Yes , it 's very nice . . . . Where do you go to school ? " " Choate . Choate School . " " Oh , I 've heard of that . " " Have you ? "  | " Oh , yes , " Hilary said , " I 've heard it 's very nice . " " Yes , it is . " " Yes , " Hilary repeated , " very nice . Do you know Rock Murphy , the good-looking football captain ? " " I do n't think he 's that all-around good looking . " " Oh , yes . All the girls at school say he 's good looking . " " Well , if you like that kind of guy , I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do like that sort of guy . " " Well , I 've always had a weakness for good-looking men . " " Ahh . " " Oh , I like people who look like you , too . " " You do ? " P.S. laughed . " But not as much . " " Oh , no , it depends . " " Depends on what ? " " Well , if  --  it depends on whether or not he has a lot of per-sonality . " " Personality . Per-son-al-i-ty , yes , well , I 've been told that even though I 'm not good looking , I 'm a lot of fun . " " Umm , " Hilary said . " Well , what I meant , I mean after all this , I was wondering if you 'd like to dance ? " " To whaat , honey ? " Hilary 's accent had changed to that of a dance hall hostess . " Dee-yance . I set ya wancha dee-yance ? " " Shooweh , doll . But there 's no mew-sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wan na waitta minute , huh ? Ya wan na wait ? " P.S. got out of the chair and turned on the phonograph . An Andre Previn record dropped onto the turntable and the music started . " So now there 's mew-sick , aw-reddy . " He held out his arms to her , and Hilary got off the sofa . She began to dance holding him away from her and she lapsed into the Farmington girl voice again . " I just lahhve Lester Lanin . " " It 's Andre Previn . " " Does he give away hats , too ? " " I do n't know . " P.S. laughed . " One-two-three , orrE-two-three , one-Two-three. "  | " You dance as though you were pumping water . " " It 's very fashionable , " he said stiffly . " Well , I just think it 's funny , that 's all . I just think it 's funny . " Her accent was getting younger and younger . " If you do n't like the way I dance you do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , " she said . " My daddy said that if P. S. Wilkinson cuts in on me or asks me to dance I have to dance with him . So that 's why I have to dance with you . " " Well , my father said I had to dance with you , too . " He continued to hold her away . " And if you  --  if you do n't want to dance with me you do n't have to either . " " True . " They danced for a moment in silence . " P. S. Wilkinson ? " " Yes ? " P.S. said . " They sure fixed the gym up nice , did n't they , P. S. Wilkinson ? " " Yes , they did . The old gym really looks nice and everything . I particularly like the way they painted all the basketballs differentcolors . " " Umm . " " You know what ? " " What ? " " No , guess . You got ta guess . " " You do n't like to dance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " I do n't mind dancing with you at all . " " You do n't ? " Hilary asked softly . " No , " P.S. answered in his normal'voice , " no , Hilary , I like it just fine . " They danced silently and P.S. felt Hilary moving closer to him , but it was done so gently , so sweetly , that he was n't even conscious of it until he felt her forehead against his cheek , felt her move her head the way she always used to when they had danced together  --  the slight tilting and lowering of her forehead to keep her hair away from his eyes , the slight nudging of her nose against the bottom of his jaw . And P.S. moved his arm higher up her back so that it rested between her shoulder blades and hep169pressed her to him softly , like a father comforting a child , and he felt her first tears against his cheek and said , " Ohhh , God , Hilary . " She pressed herself against him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her arms tightly wound around his back , her fingers crushing his jacket . He could feel the sobs shake her body , felt her back beneath his hands jump with every gasp for breath ( Dear sweet God , she really is in love with me ! Oh , God ! ) and he tried to soothe her , saying , " Do n't , Hilary ... Please , Hilary ... " But she held him tighter and cried , all reserve lost , and there was nothing for him to do but hold her and try to quiet her . And finally Hilary caught her breath and said , " Dear God , Philip , I 'm so scared ! So scared ! What are we going to do ? " We ? WE ! What are we going to do ? . . . What am I going to do , that 's the real question ! " I do n't know , " he said . She stepped back and looked at him , her fingers on either side of his face , her eyes darting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his left eye . " Do you love me , Philip ? ... Say you still love me . " " I still love you , Hilary . You know that . " And then he took a deep breath and said , " It would be so much easier if I did n't . " He wished they could go back to pretending they were at a high school dance . He did n't want to have to think of what they were going to do . He knew what she was going to want to do . You'regoing to want to get a divorce . That 's what you 're going to want . But what about me ? . . . My God , my trunk has n't even gotten back from Korea yet ! He looked at Hilary . You think you 're scared ! Jesus , you 're not half as scared as I amlHe walked back to the chair and sat down , unable to look at her . " Oh , God , I feel so  --  if only I did n't feel so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wristwatch and said that it was silly but she had forgotten she was supposed to take Hester to a friend 's house in McLean , Virginia . P.S. had n't believed her , but he knew she wanted him to leave the house as much as he wanted to go himself . He said that he should do some unpacking , and anyway there were some letters he should write telling his parents where he was living , and as he stood there telling her this , he felt so ashamed of himself , so embarrassed because he knew she knew he was running away , but what else could he do ? He hurried back to Charlie 's apartment , his head down , ignoring the heat , his mind racing through imaginary conversations he might have had with Hilary . In these conversations she would understand completely that it was impossible to expect him to commit himself this quickly to anything so serious as marriage  --  and parenthood , my God ! I mean , let 's try to be realistic , Hilary . I  --  love does n't have anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it has a lot to do with it , but realistically speaking , would n't it be wiser for us to continue along the way we are for a little longer  --  at least until I get a job and settle down ? . . . Settle down ! Who wants to settle down ? I 've been settled down all my life ! I was settled down in Korea for a goddamyear and a half ! Settling down is that last thing I want to do ! ... But Hilary would never understand that . . . . How can I make her understand that I just want to have fun for a while ?  |p171I  , after all , I just got out of Korea and I think I deserve a little fun . . . . But she 'll think it 's just the same thing as at Yale , that I ran away , that I 'm running away again for the same reason , because I 'm not ready for marriage , she 'll say . . . . Well , goddam , it I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an  --  I 'm ready to go to bed with her again , God , I 'd love to go to bed with her again , going to bed with her again would be fine . If an affair is what she wants  --  sort of a hopeless sort of affair , if only she would n't want more  --  if only for some reason it would be impossible for her to get a divorce , then everything would be perfect . Perfect ! I could say  --  I could tell her I wanted to marry her and " I ca n't marry you , Philip , " she 'd say , " You know I ca n't , it 's impossible . " .. . But she  --  it 's not impossible at all , in fact the only thing impossibleis her not getting a divorce . . . . Why could n't we just go to bed with each other ? Why the hell ca n't we just be in love with each other and go to bed with each other like before ? . . . Why is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. S. Wilkinson entered the apartment building and walked up to his room , turned the air conditioner to its coolest , undressed down to his shorts and lay back on the bed staring up at the ceiling . " I do n't see why everything has to happen so fast , " he said aloud to himself . " Why ca n't everybody just sort of take it easy ? " He got up again and wrote his father his new address , though he was probably still in Europe ; then he wrote his mother and said that he had gone through his first tests and he would be staying at the following address , and thanked her for putting up with him that first week back after Korea . He thought about callingthe CIA to tell them his new address but it was Sunday , and he thought he 'd better call Monday . I wonder if the CIA closesdown over the weekend ? . . . Of course not , they could n't , someonewould have to be there . . . . What the hell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He began to unpack his suitcase , then found his bottle of bourbon . He carried the bottle back to the bed and caught sight of his reflection in the mirror . He looked at himself standing alone in an apartment on a Sunday afternoon with a bottle in his hand and said , " Oh , for God 's sake ! I 've seen betterp172plots in Mary Worth ! " He put the bottle on top of the bureau , turned the television on , and lay down on the bed to watch the Senators lose the Sunday doubleheader . Monday morning , the 27th of June , P.S. called the number given him by the CIA secretary and was told that a letter would be sent to him at his new address . He thanked her , hung up , and picked up the telephone and dialed the first two digits of Hilary 's number and sat there with the phone in his hand , his finger poised over the dial , then he replaced the telephone and sat looking at it . He had done the exact same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped for the same reason . He knew that as soon as Hilary would answer the telephone , he would have nothing to say . He just wanted to see her , but he did n't know what to say to her . He did n't know how he could call her without accepting her terms . He was still disturbed by an overpowering sense of unreality  --  everything that had happened to him since his return seemed to bear no relation whatsoever with what he had assumed in Korea he would find once the Army was behind him . Everything was so complicated . You ca n't do " x " unless you agree to do " y " and " z . " ... But he did n't knowwho else he could see if he did n't see Hilary . All of his friends were either still in the service or scattered all over the country . None of the girls he had known were still around , and other than Hilary he really had n't known any girls for the past five years , and he could imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " You probably do n't remember me , but . . . " And he had the nagging feeling that no one did remember him . No , that isn'tit . . . . It 's not that they would n't remember me , it 's just that I do n't mean anything to them .... I was the guy they knew when , that sort of thing . . . And they had all had two years since collegeto meet new people , make new friends , do new things . And he had been in Korea . And of course they had got along fine without him . Why should n't they ? . . . And so he sat there looking at the telephone and becoming more and more depressed because he had never counted on being lonely when he returned . All he wanted was to mean something to somebody . And to have somebody mean something to him . He wanted someone to like him and talk with him and be with him and share . . . That 's it !  |p173That  's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to share things with . P.S. reached for the telephone again . He rested his hand on the telephone without picking it up . And , who else do I have to sharewith but Hilary ? . . . But what can I say to her ? What can I sayto her ? . . . He pushed himself away from the desk and paced around the room , then he went into the kitchenette and opened the ice box and  --  That 's it ! Food ! I need food ! I can call her andsay something like , " Hilary , I do n't know where the best places are to buy food in Georgetown , and I was wondering if you could tell me ? " . . . and then I can say , " Look , if you 'd like , it 's a beautifulday and we can take Hester for a walk , " and of course she 'll have the baby sitter .. . It was after five when P.S. and Hilary returned to his apartment . They carried the packages to the couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P.S. put the food they had bought on the shelves and in the small refrigerator . " Hey , there 's some beer in here . You want a beer ? " " Sure , " Hilary said . " Charlie left it behind . But I 'm sure he wo n't mind if we drink it . " I 'm sorry I could n't find any wooden spoons , " Hilary said . " So what ? I did n't even know they were important . " " Well , you ca n't cook without wooden spoons . " P.S. carried the beers into the living room . He clinked his glass against hers . " Well , here 's to my temporary home . If I do work in Washington , I think I may take over Charlie 's lease . " " Cheers , " Hilary said . " What time does your baby sitter take off ? " " Margaret ? Not till late . Why ? " " Well , I did n't know how long you could stay . I thought if you could stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cool off , then sit back . But if you have to run off I 'll wait . " " I 'm not going anywhere , go ahead . " " I 'll be quick , " P.S. said . He went into the bedroom and searched around in his suitcase for his silk bathrobe . He had two bathrobes  --  one silk hand-me-down from his father and ap174seersucker he had bought for himself . He undressed in the bedroom , pushing his clothes into a bureau drawer , then wrapped the bathrobe around him and crossed back through into the living room and into the bathroom . He took his time in the shower , starting with hot water and gradually letting it get cooler and cooler . Then with it straight cold , he stood under the shower as long as he could stand it , turned it off , and stepped out to dry himself . He had forgotten to bring a towel . " Hilary . . . " He opened the bathroom door a crack . " Hillary ? I forgot a towel .. Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Does n't matter . . . . Blue . Start with blue . " She passed him a blue towel and he dried himself , hopping from one foot to the other in the tiny bathroom . Then he carefullytriple-folded the towel and hung it above the bathtub , and put on his bathrobe . He looked at himself in the mirror  --  wiped a clear spot with his hand  --  saw that his hair needed combing and realized his comb was still in his suitcase . So he pushed his hair down as best he could with the palms of his hands , opened the bathroom door , and went back into the living room . Hilary was n't there , but he could hear her in the bedroom . He walked on through and saw she had made the bed with clean sheets . " Hey , " he said , " you did n't have to do that . " " I know . But it gave me something to do . " He stood there in his father 's silk bathrobe and looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arm around her shoulder and said , " You know what ? This may be my first home , I mean , the first place I 've had to call mine . " " Be it ever so humble . " " It 's kind of nice . " P.S. sat down on the side of the bed and tested the softness of the mattress . " The bed 's not bad , either , " he said . " It certainly beats the one I had in Korea . " Hilary sat down on the bed next to him , and he felt terribly conscious that he had nothing on underneath the bathrobe and that he was too fat in the belly and too skinny in the chest . She was sitting half-turned toward him with her right arm support/ing her weight , her left arm loose , the hand resting on her thigh . " I wish the air conditioner was in this room , " he said . " It 's not bad . If you pull your curtains the sun wo n't heat up the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window to find the pull cord . It was on the other side and he went back , past Hilary , around the foot of the bed to the window again and closed the curtains . The curtains were a dark green , and the sunlight filtering through gave the bedroom a curiously watery look , as though the entire window space were made up of tropical-fish tanks . " What time is it ? " Hilary asked . P.S. crossed to the bureau and picked up his watch . " Almost five-thirty . " " It 's still hot . " " Why do n't you take a shower ? I 've got another bathrobe . If it does n't seem too immoral or dangerous for you , help yourself . It 's cooled me off . " " I do n't know , " she said . " Go ahead . " He handed her the seersucker bathrobe . " I 'll sit in the living room . " He left the bedroom so as not to give her time to think about whether or not she should do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard her close the bedroom door and knew she was getting undressed , and he nervously patted his hands together , touched his fingertips to his lips , then crossed over to the desk and lit a cigarette . Well , here we go again . . . . He went into the bathroom and checked to see that it looked presentable . He used some toilet paper to mop up the floor next to the bathtub , flushed the paper away , and looked in the medicine cabinet . There was a bottle of witch hazel there . He carried it out with him into the living room and the bedroom door opened . Hilary was standing there framed in the doorway , the gray seersucker bathrobe wrapped around her . " You look marvelous . " She smiled and started toward him . He reached out to hold her , but she put her hand against his chest and said , " No . Wait . Let me take a shower . " " What about your hair ? "  | " I wo n't get it wet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . No . Wait . Let me take a shower . . . Wait . . . P.S. picked uphis cigarette from the ashtray and carried ashtray and cigarette into the bedroom . Then he went back into the living room , picked up the bottle of witch hazel and carried it into the bedroom , too . He stood at the foot of the bed looking around at the room . The curtains were closed , the pale-green light was perfect . He put the witch hazel on the bedside table , then straightened the sheets , tucking them in tightly , and fluffed up the pillows . He could hear the water running in the shower , and he sat down on the side of the bed to wait for her to return . He stubbed out the cigarette andlit another . What , me nervous ? . . . Of course not , do n't be silly . I always smoke this much . . . . Why should I be nervous ? Thecigarette tasted hot and slightly sour , the way the furtive cigarettesused to taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He got up from the bed and looked at himself in the mirror . Hair . Comb , where 's the comb ? He went back to his suitcase and searched through the pocket in the lid for the comb , found it , then went back in front of the mirror to comb his hair . He looked at himself again in the mirror , then went back to the side of the bed and sat down . The shower had stopped and he knew that in a moment Hilary would be back . Throat 's dry ... . That 's great . I 'll say something like " Hi , Hilary " and I 'll sound like the first tenor in the Columbus Boy Choir . . . . He got up fromthe bed and walked through the living room into the kitchenette . He heard the bathroom door open as he was searching in the refrigerator for a beer , and he found the beer , straightened up , and said , " Hilary ? I thought I 'd get myself a beer . Would you like one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered from the bedroom and P.S. pictured her pink and nude on the bed waiting for him . He considered putting the beer back in the icebox , then decided that if it was wasted what the hell . He opened the beer , poured it into a glass , and carried it back into the bedroom . Hilary was standing in front of the mirror combing her hair . " That bathrobe 's never looked so good , " he said.  |p177Hilary  smiled . " I like it . When did you get it ? I do n't remember you having one before . Not like this . I remember your red silk one .. . " Ah , this one 's finally falling apart . I think I 'm the third generation to wear it . I got the seersucker in Long Island when I went to see my mother . " " How is your mother ? " " Fine . She 's fine . Everybody 's fine .... I think we went through all this at the wedding . " Hilary had her back to him and was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very wet ? " " No . " P.S. sat down on the side of the bed . " You look so lovely standing there , " he said , " I wish you could ... " " What ? " " I was being stupid . I was going to say that I wish you could stand there forever , but I suddenly had a picture of you doomed to an eternity of standing in a damp bathrobe in front of a mirrorcombing your hair . " Hilary put down the comb and turned to face him , smiling . " It would n't be much fun . " " No , it would n't . " She sat down on the edge of the bed and crossed her arms in front of her breast and massaged her neck muscles . " Stiff ? " he asked . " A little . I played some tennis yesterday afternoon for the first time in months . " " Would you like a back rub ? Do you remember the back rubswe used to give each other at college ? I think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubs . " " I know . . . " Well , anyway , if you 'd like one I 'd be happy to give you one . " His throat was dry again and he reached over onto the night table for his beer . " Want a sip ? " " No , no , thanks . Beer just makes me hot . " " I love the stuff . " He drank some of his beer and put the glass back on the table . They were both silent . " Philip . "  | " Yes ? " " About what you said . . . You know , I mean , Sunday afternoon about our not knowing  --  not knowing what we were going to do . Do you remember ? " " Yes , " he said softly . " Well , I was n't just talking about just going to bed . " " I know , " he said . She reached for his hand and held it . " Maybe I should go . It 's unfair . I 'm being unfair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was going to make love to you . " " No , do n't say that . We do n't have to make love . Do n't go . " " But it 's not fair to you ! " " What 's not fair to me ? I did n't bring you up here just to make love . I do n't think I really wanted to . . . well , I wanted to , but . . . Maybe I feel a little better  --  more relaxed now . Look , Hilary , I 'll tell you what I 'll do . Lie down and I 'll give you a back rub . We 're both worried and nervous and everything and it 'll relax you . So do n't worry about making love . We do n't have to . " She smiled at him , then leaned forward and kissed him gently on the lips , touching his cheek with her fingertips . She stood up and undid the cord to the bathrobe , then , standing with her back to him , let it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she was wearing her brassiere and panties . With her back still to him , she slid onto the bed and lay down , her head turned away from him . He sat where he was , looking at her for a moment , remembering her body , surprised at how thin she was , the ribs showing faintly on her back . Then he got up and knelt over the backs of her legs . " I 've got some witch hazel , " he said . " Would you like me to use that ? " " Sure , " she said , " it would be nice and cool . " He splashed some witch hazel onto his hands and said , " It 's going to be cooler than that at first . " " Okay . " He let a few drops hit her shoulder , then he placed his hands on her neck muscles and began gently to massage the back of her neck . He moved his hands slowly , using his fingers to work the muscles of her neck and shoulders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained working on her shoulder muscles . " Feel good ? " " Very , " she said . " Look , I do n't want to seem too forward , as it were , but if I can undo your bra I 'll be able to do your back better . " " Go ahead . " He had trouble , of course , with the catches . He always had trouble with them . He thought about his brother , Carter , who had once told him he had mastered brassieres and was able with one deft , incredibly suave snap of the fingers to unhook the most intricate brassieres known to women . He finally got the hooks undone and Hilary lifted herself slightly and reached beneath herself and pulled the cups away from her breasts , then took the bra off entirely . She lowered herself again and he could see how her weight pushed the fullness of her breasts to her sides . P.S. leaned forward to take another sip of beer . He became increasinglyaware of her thighs touching his where he was kneelingabove her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands and began to massage her between her shoulder blades . Each time he pressed down on her , her breast flattened beneath her and he could hear the slight push of air out of her . With his hands now on either side of her spine , his thumbs working the spine , his fingers the muscles of her back , he began to work downwards , below the rib cage toward the small of her back . He concentrated on the area just above the swelling of her hips . " That feels good , " she said . She brought her hands from beneath the pillow and , hooking her thumbs in the waistband of her panties , slid them down to just cover her buttocks , then she tucked her hands back beneath the pillow . The gesture was so natural , so automatic in its acceptance of what they were doing together that P.S. was a little shocked . He began to massage the base of her spine . " The coccyx , " he said , " man 's prehensile tail . His link to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and without doubt the most painful bone to break in the body . I knew a guy once who fell and broke his coccyx . There is no way to be comfortable . Youp180ca n't sit , certainly . But whenever you move or however you lie , it hurts like hell . He was in terrible pain . " He raised her panties slightly and began to massage the bulge of her hip . Then he moved his hands back up to her shoulders . " You must be getting tired , " she said . " No , not a bit . I enjoy it . " " You sure ? " she asked . She turned to look at him , slightly raising herself . He saw her breasts hang free , not touching the bed and he could not stop himself . He moved his hand to cover her breast , he felt it fill his hand , the nipple harden against his palm . " Ahh , God , " he said . He held her small breast within his hand , his fingertip lightly touching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then she lay down again , crushing his hand against her . He withdrew it gently and continued to rub her back . He concentrated on the small of her back . It was safe . Harmless . Nothing erotic about the small of the back  --  at least not as erotic as the breasts , and then almost as though he was unaware of what was happening , his hands were moving up past the marks of the waistband on her skin , up her ribs , and this time , Hilary , too , moved , raising herself on her elbows , her breasts not touching the sheet , and then her sharp intake of breath as his hands cupped her , touched her , moved over her . Hilary , her head lowered , forehead pressed against the pillow , her eyes squeezed tightly closed , did not move , even her breathing had stopped , as she held her breath . P.S. leaned forward slightly , resting his forearms along her sides , his hands beneath her holding her breasts . " Hilary . . . Hilary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the backs of her legs and lay down on his side next to her and she moved also so that they were lying together . He undid his bathrobe and threw it aside so that they were touching each other . " Oh , God , Hilary , " he said , " I 've thought of holding you like this so many times . " She pressed herself against him , her head resting against his left arm beneath her , his right arm around her . She lay with her eyes closed , her chin buried into the hollow of his shoulder . Her hand moved across his chest , then down his side to his hip , pulling him more tightly againstp181her . They held each other for a moment , and then he gently placed his hand against her shoulder and pushed her so that she lay flat on the bed . " Let me look at you , " he said . " I just want to look at you . " P.S. lay so that his left elbow supported him and he looked down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right hand he traced the small circle of her breast , his fingertips touching her collar bone , her throat , then down her side again to her hip . Her eyes were still closed and he moved his hand from her hip to her stomach , his fingers just beneath the waist of her panties . He fanned his hand across her and she shivered and opened her eyes and looked at him . " Philip ... " " Yes ? " His throat was so dry he had half expected no sound to come out . " Philip , if we do n't stop now , we are n't going to stop . " He did not move his hand . " Philip , " she repeated . He slid his hand beneath her panties and she suddenly , violently twisted away from him . " Hilary . . . " " No , " she said . " We ca n't . " " I was n't going to , " he said , " I only wanted to touch you . " " But we ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to stop and we ca n't . " He tried to touch her again , but she held his hand away . " Please , Philip , help me , " she said , " do n't . " He sat up on the bed and reached for his beer , which was now warm and flat . " Okay , " he said . He sipped his beer and stood up and pulled the bathrobe around him . Hilary remained on the bed looking at him , her eyes worried . " Are you angry ? " P.S. smiled . " No , I 'm not angry . " She smiled tentatively . " I 'm sorry . . . " " Do n't be . Really , Hilary . " " But I am . I said it was unfair . " " No , there 's nothing unfair about it . I 'm glad we stopped . " " Are you really ? "  | " No . " He laughed . " I 'm not glad at all right now . But I will be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hugged him . And he held her , his arms around her back . She pressed the side of her face against his chest . " I love you , Philip , " she said , " I really do . " " I love you , Hilary . " " Are you sure ? " " What kind of a question is that ? " " I do n't know , " she said . She let go of him and got off the bed . " Where 's my bra ? " " Next to the bed . On the floor , " he said . " I 'm sorry . I really am . Go into the living room . Let me get dressed . I did n't mean to get you upset . " " Who 's upset ? " he asked . Oh , God ... this is so awful ! He tried to laugh at himself and she laughed a little and he picked up his beer and walked into the living room with it . He sat down on the couch and picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking slightly , and he was so sick of himself . " Phil ? " Hilary called from the bedroom . " What time is it ? " " My watch is on the table next to the bed . " " Thanks . " " What time is it ? " he asked . " Almost seven . I told Margaret I 'd be home at six-thirty . I 'd better be going . . . Phil ? " " Yes ? " " Are you angry with me ? " she asked , still in the bedroom . " No . " " Will you have dinner with me ? " " I do n't think we 'd better , " he said . " Besides , I 've got to unpack and put things away . " " Have dinner and then put things away . " He could hear her moving around . " No . If I spend any more time with you tonight I do n't know what will happen . " " But we wo n't have a chance to be together otherwise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like to cook something for you . "  |p183She  came out of the bedroom . She was slipping the belt through the loops of her dress . " I must look a sight , " she said , then continued on into the bathroom . He saw her reflection as she looked at herself in the mirror . " God , I do n't think I look a bit different , " she said . " Why ? Are you supposed to ? " " Well , I thought I might look a little different  --  sort of more like Lucretia Borgia or maybe Catherine the Great ... " " You look just exactly like Hilary Farnum , " he said and immediatelywished he had n't , since Hilary Farnum was no more . It was Mrs. Bruce Mallory . Hilary walked back to him and sat down on the couch next to him and held his hand . " I 've got to go , " she said . " I 'll walk you down . " " In your bathrobe ? " She laughed . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sorry you wo n't have dinner with me . " " I ca n't , Hilary . Really , I 'd better get this stuff done . " " Then call me , will you ? " He nodded . " Promise ? " " Oh , for God 's sake , of course I 'll call you . " She stood up and he stood up with her and walked with her to the door . He leaned forward to kiss her and she turned her head slightly and he kissed her on the cheek . " Lipstick , " she said . P.S. just nodded and opened the door for her . " You are mad at me , are n't you ? " she said . " No , of course not , " he answered . " If I 'm mad at anyone I 'm mad at myself for being such a jerk . " She looked at him worriedly and he took her hand and said , " No , really . I 'm fine . I 'll call you later on . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the door and looked at him and said , " And , Philip ? Thank you . " He started to ask " For stopping ? " but he could n't do anything but nod.  |p184PHILIP  SADLER WILKINSON finished his secondshower of the afternoon and stood drying himself in the bathroom . He thought of how close they had come to making love . If I 'd really wanted to we could have . She said herself that she would n't have been able to stop . So why did I stop ? .. . He went over to his bureau and began to lay out fresh clothes . He had just started matching socks when the telephone rang , startling him . He walked back into the living room and picked up the telephone . " Hello ? " " Charlie ? " a man 's voice asked on the other end . " No , I 'm sorry . Charlie left a few days ago for his honeymoon in Bermuda . " " For where ? " The man laughed . " Bermuda , " P.S. repeated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " P. S. Wilkinson . " " Who ? " " P. S. Wilkinson . " " Phil ? " the man 's voice asked . " From the Virginia Preparatory School ? " " Well , I went there , yes ... " " Phil , this is Linus Hendricks , do you remember me ? I was on the Honor Committee . Well , how the hell are you ? "  | " Fine . Fine , " he said . He tried to remember what Linus Hendricks had looked like . " Listen , you 're not just giving me head about Charlie , are you ? " " No . No , he really got married . " " Well , what are you doing ? " " Nothing much . I just got out of the Army . I 've taken Charlie 's apartment for a couple of weeks . " " Well , that 's fine . That 's fine . Listen , P.S. , my roommates and I are giving a party tonight and want you to come . Bring a date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I do n't know many girls here , " P.S. explained . " Fine , then this 'll give you a chance to meet some . Listen , it starts about eight o'clock and it 's going to go on all night long , so come whenever you like : 1414 36th Street . . . it 's by the university . " " Fourteen-fourteen 36th Street , " P.S. repeated . " Okay , fine , Linus . I 'll try to make it and thanks for asking me . " " Well , I 'm looking forward to seeing you again . " " Same here , " P.S. said . " So long . " P.S. hung up the telephone . Linus Hendricks . . . Linus Hendricks . . . There was Mabrey , of course , the head monitor ... Hendricks ! The President of the Honor Committee . . . a nice guy . . . Why the hell should n't I go to a party ! He arrived a little after ten . It was one of the small houses on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back , two stories , and thin walls shared with the houses on either side . He walked up to the door and considered pressing the bell . But he could hear the sounds of the party going on and he tried the door , it was n't locked , so he walked in . He was standing in a small hallway , on his left was a kitchen and directly in front of him was a screen which closed off the living room slightly . He moved forward to the screen and could see into the living room . The people inside were of mixed ages  --  the twenty to thirty-five bracket  --  and P.S. stood there , half-hidden behind the screen , trying to see if there was anyone he knew . From the noise he could tell that most of the people had been at the party for quitep186some time . There was n't anyone that he recognized . There were obviously others around , though . He stepped into the living room , trying to avoid kicking over drinks which were standing on the rug . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did n't seem to bother them . " Excuse , please . Coming through , " P.S. said . He squeezed past a young man who was saying , " No , that 's not right ! So , look God damn it a minute , will ya ? John F. Kennedy does n't  --  God damn it , will you listen to me a minute ? " There 's someone who looks familiar , what 's his name ? He was in Yale , . . Fence Club , friend of Charlie 's , what the hell was his name ? ... If he turns this way . . . No , damn ! It is n't . You 'd think out of this many there 'd be at least one person . . . The garden , on through to the garden . . . " Excuse me , please ? " Move it , will you ? That 's a good fellah . . . . My God , there 's a pretty girl , wonder who she is . . . I wonder if I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a suit . . . Got to get some clothes now that I 'm out . . . There 's a girl I know . . . " Excuse me , please ? Coming through . " She used to date Wally Wallace , what was her name ? Went to Smith . . . something like Beebe , BeeGee , Bee Jay , God the number of girls called " B. J. " . . . Didi ! Didi ! That 's what her name is . Didi Williams . Used to sleep with Wally .. . He made his way over to the girl . She was talking to a young man whom P.S. did n't know . He hoped she would ask him to join them . The girl smiled at him and P.S. smiled back . " Hello , Didi , " he said , " it 's so nice to see you again . I 'm P. S. Wilkinson , do you remember ? It 's been a long time . " " Why , yes , P.S. How nice to see you , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No , I do n't believe I have , " P.S. said . " How are you ? I 'm P. S. Wilkinson . " Zip  --  scratch Didi ! " Ron Baker , " the young man said , shaking P.S. 's hand . " Nice to meet you , " " Nice to meet you , " P.S. said . " Well , how have you been ? " Didi asked . " Pretty good . And you ? " Didi looped her arm through her fiance 's and smiled up at him . " Just fine , " she said.  | " It is certainly nice to see you both , " P.S. said . " When are the two of you getting married ? " " We 're not certain yet , " the young man said . " Probably not until next Christmas , " Didi said . " Well , that 's great , " P.S. said . He nodded to them both . " I hope we will see each other again before then . Will you excuse me , please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made his way out to the garden . They 're probably just right for each other . Jesus , everybody'sgetting married ! He could n't find Linus Hendricks in the garden either . All he saw were more couples . There was an empty chair , though  --  one of those canvas , collapsible director 's chairs ,  --  and he made his way over to it and sat down . From the chair he had a surrealistic view of shoulders and rear ends and he decided that the party might become less unreal if he got himself a drink . So he stood up and pushed his way back into the living room . The young man was still standing near the entrance saying , " Hey , no , so look God damn it a minute , will ya ? The whole thing is --  Look , will ya listen a minute ? " P.S. fixed himself a mild bourbon and water and edged back so that he could lean against the wall . Opposite him was a couch on which a young man with red hair was seated , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sitting on the floor , her legs tucked under her as though she had been kneeling then slipped to one side , was a pretty young girl with very blonde hair , carelesslyworn , who was looking down at the rug . Her left arm was resting on the redhead 's thigh . P.S. looked at the girl and tried not to listen to the man blocking the doorway who was saying , " Look , God damn it a minute . The point is not whether or not Mitchell and Martin were fairies "  --  he pronounced it fay-rees  --  " but what made them feel they had to leave the country in the first place . Am I right ? " P.S. looked at the girl 's arm . The hairs on her arm were blonde , very light and sun-bleached like her eyebrows . Her hand was pale , nails polished a silver blue . Her arm lay on the redheaded man 's thigh as though it were a napkin . She shifted her position slightly and her dress rode up , exposing the tops of her stockings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of moving immediately , she inhaled on her cigarette and droppedp188it into a half-filled whisky glass , then she adjusted her dress . She plucked a shred of tobacco from the tip of her tongue and squeezed it like a small brown worm between her long silver-blue fingernails . She looked at the piece of tobacco , wiggled it , then looked up at P.S. , and smiled . Now , something like that little piece would be nice . . . And her red friend does n't look as though he 'd be of much use ... . P.S. smiled back at her . Should I go over ? Get her a fresh drink . He pushed himself away from the wall and walked over to her . " I 'm P. S. Wilkinson . " " Hello , P. S. Wilkinson . " Oh , for Christ 's sake . One of those ! " Can I get you something to drink ? " " Sure , " she said . " Well , then , what would you like to drink ? " " What are you drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's fine , " she said . P.S. started back to the bar and she said , " P. S. Wilkinson ? " and he stopped and said , " Yes ? " " I 'll drink from yours . " " I 'll get you one of your own , " he said . The one in the room I pick and she 's probably a writer for Teen-Times . . . . My God , I wonder who writes her material ? " Hello , P. S. Wilkinson , " for Chrissake .... He mixed her drink . Then he remembered dancing with Hilary . Hilary had called him " P. S. Wilkinson . " He carried the drink back to her . " Here you are . " " Thank you . " " What happened to your friend ? " " Him ? " she asked . " He 's passed out . He had too much to drink . " " Really ? " " Yes , " she said . She shifted the drink from her left hand toher right hand and wiped her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back down at the rug and began whistling . P.S. sat down on the rug near her and put his drink wherep189it would n't be kicked over . " Are you from Washington ? " he asked . What school do you go to ? " Yes . I work at I.B.M . " " Ah , " P.S. said . He offered her a cigarette and took one for himself , then lit them both . " Did you ever see Snows of Kilimanjaro ? " " The movie ? " P.S. asked . " Gregory Peck ? Yes , I think so . " " Well , do you remember how Gregory Peck and Ava Gardner lit their cigarettes ? Kind of leaning together , both lighting their cigarettes from the same match at the same time ? " " I 'm not sure I remember that . " " It was very sexy , " the girl said . " Yes , " P.S. said . " Then , well , I 'm sorry I did n't light ours the same way . " He added , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if I tried I 'd probably set fire to the two of us . I 'm not very good at that sort of thing . " " Well , it probably takes practice , " the girl said . " Practice makes perfect . " " That reminds me of an old two-line college joke about the girl who says she 's perfect . The young man said , I 'm practice . ' " " What ? " " The girl said that she was pra  --  the girl said she was perfect and the young man said he was practice . . . Practice makes perfect ? " " Oh , " the girl said . " Well , I never said it would be funny . All I said was that it was an old two-line  --  forget it . " " Do you think Bill is going to come to ? " " You mean wake up ? . . . Eventually . He 'll come out of it eventually . " " I 'm hungry . " " There 's some cheese and crackers by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , " she said . She took her arm down from the redheaded man 's leg and yawned . " God , this party 's a bore . " " Do you know many of the people ? " " A few . Not many . "  | " I do n't know anybody , " P.S. said . " Then why do n't we get out of here and get some dinner ? " " You mean you want me to take you out to dinner ? " P.S. asked . " I do n't have much money . " " Neither do I. We 'll find some place cheap . " We 'll find some place cheap . . . First she decides we 'll go out to dinner and now she 's deciding how much we 'll spend . P.S. helped her up . He looked around the room once for Linus Hendricks . " I have n't seen the host anywhere . " " He 's around somewhere , " the girl said . " But do n't worry . If you really feel you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I should try to see him . " God damn it , is everybody making my plans for me these days ? " No , come on , let 's get out of here . " P.S. looked at the girl for a moment . " What 's your name ? " " Sandy Frommer . " " Well , listen , Sandy Frommer  --  to use one of your own gimmicks  --  ifI 'm to take you to dinner , allow me at least to show some initiative . Okay ? " " Sure . You 're cute when you 're mad . " " Oh , for Chrissakel " Wilkinson exploded . " Who does write your material ? " " What do you mean ? " " Nothing , let 's get out of here . " " That 's what I 've been saying . " She laughed . P.S. Wilkinson took the girl to a small restaurant on WisconsinAvenue which served good roast beef and good beer and did it inexpensively . And because it was late , the waiters hurried them through dinner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You want some coffee at my place ? " the girl asked . " Sure . What time is it ? " " About eleven-something , " she said . " I do n't live too far fromhere . Across Wisconsin to 31st Street . We can have coffee there . " " Sure , " P.S. said . " I could use some . I promise not to stay long . " " Stay as long as you want , " the girl said . " My roommate won'tbe back until next week . We 've got to be quiet , though . Thep191landlady started bitching last week that we were too noisy . " " All right , " P.S. said . The girl slipped her hand between his chest and his arm and curled her fingers over his forearm . He looked down at her hand and pressed her arm against him . What the hell . . . he thought to himself . Why not ? " Do you like working for the government ? " the girl asked him . " I do n't work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might work for them , but I do n't work for them yet . " " I would n't work for the government if they paid me , " she said . " They 'd kind of have to , would n't they ? " " What ? " " You said , I would n't work for the government if they paid me . ' That 's something called slip talk ' . . . it 's a mixed-up sentence . Like , for example , everyone in the whole room was there . ' Follow ? " She said , " I guess I 'm just tired . " " Listen , I 'll just walk you to your door ... I 'm kind of tired too . I do n't think I 'll have any coffee . I 'll just walk you home . " " What 's the matter ? " " Nothing . I 'm just too tired to keep up my end of this con-versation . " ' Well , do n't feel you have to , " she said . " We can just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shh . " They turned down a quiet street , her hand still resting on his arm . It was cool now in the evening and P.S. walked along the curb . He stopped suddenly and swore . The girl giggled slightly as he rubbed his shoe against the curb . Then he found a patch of grass and ran his shoe back and forth . " I hope I got it off . " " Scuff your foot as we walk . You should n't have walked so close to the curb . " " Well , how would I know some dog  --  " " You should have known . " " What street are we on ? " P.S. asked  | " Thirty-first . There 's the post office . Now do you know where you are ? " " Oh , sure . " " And this is where I live . " " The Hamilton Arms ? Good God , I did n't know anybody lived here . " " Why ? " " I do n't know . It just seems like sort of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courtyard and around some corners , then up the outside stairs to a small balcony . " Voila ! " She opened the door to her apartment , flicked the light switch and let him in . P.S. stood looking at the apartment for a moment . All the lights had red bulbs . " Good God . " " Kind of crazy , is n't it ? " " Well , I suppose it 's great if you 're a night fighter pilot . I should think it would drive you buggy . " " No . " She giggled . " I like it . A lot of my friends think I 'm sort of a nut , but I like living this way . I think it expresses my personality , do n't you ? I mean , do n't you think it 's important that a person live in a place that expresses their personality ? " P.S. walked across the room to look at her paintings . On one wall was a canvas painted entirely white except for the bottom right-hand corner . Although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure , the colors in that corner seemed to be mostly violent shades of red , orange , yellow , and green . " Do you like it ? " " This painting ? I 'm not sure what it means . " " It 's called Subconscious ' . . . it represents all the tensions beneath the surface . " " Well .. " You do n't have to like it , " she said . " I 'm going to get things going , so why do n't you make yourself at home . Is instant coffee okay ? " " Fine , " he said . P.S. walked toward a chair  --  one of those canvas and metal batwing chairs . " There 's a more comfortable chair over th  --  oops 1 " Shep193hurried over to the couch and picked up a brassiere and a slip and stuffed them under a pillow . " I was n't exactly expecting company , " she explained . P.S. sat down in the chair . On the floor was a beige hooked wool rug . The tables were not-quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had looked at earlier , the paintingswere fairly common reproductions . There was the standard Toulouse-Lautrec poster reproduction ( " May Belfort " ) , the Picasso blue picture of the family on the beach . There were a few unframed reproductions tacked to the walls . Beneath the Picasso was a stereophonograph . He got up from the batwing chair and sat down on the couch . He heard the toilet flush , then Sandy walked into the room . " You want to listen to some music ? " " Sure . " " What do you like ? " " Anything that is n't rock and roll . " " Jazz ? " " Most of it . " " How about some Miles Davis ? Or Brubeck ? " " I do n't much like Brubeck , " he said . " Listen , do you have any Charlie Byrd ? Not The Bird ' Parker , but the guitar player ? I used to listen to him in Korea . They had a program from the Showboat Lounge . " " Sure . " P.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She leaned over and began to sort through the records , and he stood behind her looking at her . He placed his hands on her hips and she stood up , holding his hands away from her , and looked at him . He bent forward to kiss her and she ducked , saying , " No funny stuff , now . " It was one of those phrases which made him feel physically sick . " No funny stuff " . . . funny stuff ! " No funny stuff , " he said . He stood back from her and she leaned over again and looked through the records . P.S. went back to the couch and sat down . The red lights in the apartment seemed to intensify the insanity of the day . The coolness of thep194earlier part of the evening was gone now and in its place was the increasing stuffiness of the impending thunderstorm . The girl placed the record on the spindle and waited for the phonographto warm up . Then she let the record drop into place and sat down next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her own , looking at his palm , then turned it over and traced the veins which covered the back of his hand . " You 've got nice hands , " she said . " Thank you . " " No , I mean it . You ought to be a surgeon or a musician or something . " " It 's a little late to get started on it . " " It 's never too late . " " Really ? " he asked . He turned on the couch to face her and his knee touched her thigh and she did not move away . " It was a silly thing for me to say . The coffee water 's going to boil in a minute , in fact I think it 's boiling now . " She got up and walked around the corner to the kitchenette and P.S. could hear her spooning the instant coffee into two cups . " You want sugar and milk ? " " Yes , please . " A few moments later she returned carrying two cups of coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's china that Charlie had in the apartment . He took a sip and said , " This is good . " " Glad you like it . " They sat together in silence on the couch for a few minutes , then P.S. said , " Whew , it 's hot . I hope the storm breaks soon . " " I 've got a fan , " she said , getting up . " The fan will cool us off . " She turned on a fan , one of the swivel kind , and sat back down on the couch . " This is very nice , " P.S. said , as the fan began to blow the cooler air across them . " Thank you . " " This has been a funny day . . . Well , not funny . . . It was probably perfectly normal . But it 's been so strange in a way . I guess I 've been out of the country too long . It just has n't seemedp195very real . Oh , blah-blah-blah , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have anything to say . You talk , Sandy , I feel like listening . Tell me about yourself . " " Like what ? " " Personal things . Tell me personal things about yourself . We 're at the best stage right now to tell each other personal things . It 's late at night , the fan 's cooling us off . . . coffee . . . music ... " He stretched out his legs so that only the base of his spine and the back of his neck touched the couch . " And if we get too personalthen we just wo n't see each other again . But , I think it 's good to tell people personal things . It sets them in the proper perspective . . . . You want me to tell you a personal thing ? " " I 'm not sure . " " Oh , for God 's sake . " P.S. laughed . " I 'm not going to talk to you about  --  do n't be  --  Listen , let me tell you something , Sandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nineteen . " " Nineteen , okay , I 'm five years older than you . Which does n't necessarily mean anything except that I 've been around five more years  --  Anyway , listen . With people , a lot of people you know  --  I mean really know  --  you can never talk to them . Or if you do , the only things you tell them are exactly what you want them to hear , and you only tell them the good things  --  the things which you think will make them appreciate you or think how great you are . I ca n't stand all that old blah-blah-blah . The weather . Problemswith the boss . What baby said . All that crap . I keep thinking that my brain , that soggy gray thing inside my skull , it 's been all sort of tamped down like a baseball diamond by a lot of crap . I mean there 's about an inch and a half of air space there now at the top which used to be good live brain cells , but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the weather . ... They say the brain never forgets . It stores everything . Jesus , I bet forty percent of my brain cells , the memory cells , have been used up storing worthless bits of knowledge like , Nine July 1947 , Boy it 's hot today . Place sure needs rain , ' things like that . ... Do you pray ? " " Yes . "  | " So do I. So there . There 's something personal . We could have gone months and months without knowing that about each other . Think of all the married couples who do n't know if their other half says prayers before going to sleep . See what I mean ? We know that much about each other already . " " But everybody prays . " " Maybe so , but not everybody admits it . Listen , Sandy , are you sure you feel like talking ? " " Yes , but what about you ? I thought you were very tired . " " I was , but the coffee 's picked me up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work so mayb  --  " " No , I do n't . " " I thought you said you worked for I.B.M . " " I did , but I got fired . " " Fired ? How come ? " " Well , I just did n't like the job and I kept coming in later andlater . So they gave me a two weeks ' notice , this morning . " " Ah , that 's a shame . That 's too bad  --  except , you did n't likethe job , so you said . What are you going to do now ? " " I do n't know . Maybe nothing . " " Well , then we can sit here and talk . " " Fine , " she said . " Why do n't you take off your coat ? I think I 'm going to get into something else . " P.S. laughed . " Are n't I supposed to suggest you do something like that ? Does n't the evil old man always say , Hey , baby , why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , the girl 's supposed to say that . And then the man 's supposedto worry that the girl meant she was going to slip into a pair of slacks instead of a negligee . " ' Well , which one do you mean ? " " Which one do you think I mean ? " " Ahh , you 're a very lovely girl . I like blonde hair , particularly long blonde hair like yours . And I like your eyes , they 're a good blue . But I 'm not wild about silver fingernails , though I prefer that color to orange . . . Probably slacks . " " What do you mean probably slacks ' ? " She laughed . " After a snow job like that what makes you think I wo n't slip into somethingblack and sexy ? "  | " Like an underwater rubber swim suit ? ... Do you own anythingblack and sexy ? " " I 've got a set of leotards . " She smiled . " And a pair of black slacks . " " But not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it 's a shorty . . . it only comes up to  --  I mean down to here . " She traced a line with her fingertipsacross the tops of her thighs . " Well , if the choice were mine , I 'd say wear the negligee  --  but that 's because I 've had the feeling lately that I must be some sort of a sex fiend . " She looked worried for a moment . " You are n't , are you ? " He saw that she was serious and he laughed and said , " Good God , not " " Well , " she said , " a girl 's got to be careful . " " I 'm sure she does , " P.S. said , and he finished his coffee . " Would you like some more ? " " Do you have any beer ? " " In the icebox . Help yourself . " " I 'll tell you what I really need is a bathroom . " " Right in front of you as you go out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you going to change ? " " In here . " " Okay . I 'll get myself a beer and hide in the bathroom until you 're ready . Call me when you 're ready . " " I will , " Sandy said . P.S. got himself a beer and then he went into the bathroom . He looked at his teeth in the mirror , saw that he had a small piece of roast beef stuck between two teeth and tried to pry it out with his fingernail . That did n't work , so he tried sloshing some beer around in his mouth . He finally worked the scrap loose and finished up in the bathroom . He leaned against the wall waiting for her , but there was n't much room , so he put the lid down on the toilet and sat . From where he was sitting he could see just the top of his head in the medicine cabinet mirror . His forehead was mirrored in the chrome stripping around the cabinet . And he moved his head up and down watching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He took a sip of beer and placed the glass on the sink . He looked down at his feet and his glance caught the keyhole in the bathroom door . He looked at the keyhole for a moment , wondering what he could see if he looked through it , and he was suddenlystruck by the thought that he could create a new saying to go along with " The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence . " It would have to do with the fact that the view is always better on the other side of the keyhole . The view is always betteron the other side of the keyhole ? . . . The other side of the keyholehas the better view ? . . . No one likes the view on their side of the keyhole ? ... Looking at life through a rose-colored keyhole . . . How 's that for the name of a book ? " Life Through a Rose-Colored Keyhole ! " . . . P.S. suddenly remembered readingsomewhere about Victorian women who stuck long hatpins through keyholes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at the keyhole . And then there was the one about thebeatnik who had his keyhole fitted with dark glasses . . . Hey , hey , P.S. , that 's pretty good . Maybe you should write gags for " I 'm ready , " Sandy called . " Okay , " he answered . As he opened the bathroom door he thought about telling Sandy his ideas about keyholes and then thought if he did she would immediately think he had been watching her through the keyhole and decided against it . He crossed through the kitchenette and into the living room . She was sitting on the couch and was wearing shorts and a sleeveless blouse . " A bitter disappointment , " he said . " For sure I thought you 'd be lounging in your scanty panties . " " In my what ? " " Scanty panties , " P.S. repeated . " Are n't they the things that are always being advertised in the backs of men 's magazines ? Scanty panties and peekaboo bras . " " Well , to be honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a negli-gee . " P.S. said , " How about some more music ? " " Okay , " the girl said . She got up and walked over to the phonograph . She put on some records , started the first one playing , and then walked back to the couch.  | " You know , " P.S. said , " my brother says that he can tell by the way a girl walks whether or not she 's a virgin . " She sat down hurriedly . " Do you think that 's possible ? " P.S. asked . " How 's your beer doing ? " P.S. looked at her . Oh , God , I 'm boring the ass off her . " My beer 's fine , " he said . Try once more . . . Just once more . . . And , for God 's sake , make it mean something . " Sandy , I ca n't seem tobe able to  --  I have n't been able to talk to many people since I got back . Really talk , and  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anywayit 's such an awful word . " " Yes , yes , it is . Just as awful a word as saying it 's an awful word . Look , will you do me a favor ? I mean it 's not anything you 'll have to get up to do , it 's just something I have a feeling that you might be the type of girl who does it  --  these things . First of all , never draw faces on letters . Never draw little smiling faces on letters . I do n't know why girls do that . It makes me sick . Next , while on the subject of letters , if you 're going to dot your i 's , ' dot them , do n't put little circles above them , dot them for Chrissake or leave them alone . And do n't for God 's sake write poetry about lonely children on beaches , or a happy little girl on a calliope . . . Is she happy ? I mean , what the hell , we think she 's having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride means more to her than anything else in the world . Actually she 's probably worried about some kid party she has to go to , and she 's eleven years old and her mother 's making her wear a training bra and twelve-year-old Morris Edelman is going to try to touch her between her legs  --  that 's what she 's worried about , not whether or not she 's going to catch a brass ring . " " It 's  --  " " What ? " " Nothing , " she said . " It 's not a calliope . It 's a merry-go-round . " She turned his wrist over and looked at his watch . " All right , " P.S. said . " I 'll go . " " I did n't mean for you to leave , " she said . " I was just noticing it 's almost two o'clock . " " I guess I was just talking to you and trying to make thingsp200mean something to me . " He stood up and took another sip of his beer , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table . " Look , you yourself said that you were fired , or quit your job because it did n't mean anything to you . What , what does mean something to you ? " " What do you mean ? Do you mean what do I want to do ? " she asked , then said , " Well , I want to get married , and I want to have children . " " All right , I suppose that 's fair enough . What do you want your husband to do ? " " I do n't care . I do n't care what he does . " " You would n't care no matter what he did ? " " I do n't want him to be a crook ... " " What if he went into the government ? I mean not the Foreign Service or CIA or something , but went into politics . Would you want your husband to be a politician ? " " That would be nice . " " Would you respect him if he were a congressman ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my husband no matter what he did . " " Well , then , do you think other people would be impressed if he were a congressman ? " " Sure they would . " " Really ? Would you be impressed if you met a congressman ? " " Probably . " " You do n't think that congressmen are n't sort of  --  you do n't think they have sort of a reputation for being ambitious and conceited and interested in themselves and money more than in the people they represent ? " " Of course they are n't . Not all of them . " " Why should politicians be such awful people ? Who makes them become awful people ? Or is it that only the awful people want to become politicians . And Presidents ! When I think of the type of Presidents we 've had  --  well , Roosevelt did do a lot . And Truman turned out a lot better than anybody thought , but still  --  maybe this is silly  --  but I know damn well he would n't have been invited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p201And  Eisenhower ? How in God 's name did that man ever get to be elected President ? Well , maybe Stevenson was n't much of an alternative . He was n't a war hero , he did n't have a particularly fetching smile , but at least he had brains ! But Eisenhower , Jesus ! And all his I would n't know about that ' and I have n't checked these figures . . . ' I once was looking at the transcript of one of Eisenhower 's press conferences , and he started out his answers with well ' something like seventeen out of twenty-four times .. . Well .. " What do you think of Kennedy and Nixon ? " " I have n't been here enough to know that much about them . I guess I hope Kennedy wins . . . . My God , he 's got everything going for him . He looks good on television , he 's handsome , good rich family , and he can always buy votes if he needs them . " " Why are you so cynical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not cynical . I 'm an optimist , I pray to God things get better . There 's nothing in the world I 'd rather see than a government I can respect for this country . Hell , I love this country . I just do n't happen to be wild about the people who run it . " He paused , then added , " And speaking of running , I guess it 's time for me to run along home . Thank you very much , Sandy , I 'm sorry I stayed so long . " He stood up . " Not at all , " she said , rising from the couch . " I 'm glad you did . " He was a little disappointed she did n't ask him to stay . " You 're very lovely , and very nice , and I had a very good time . " " So did I , " she said . ' Well , I think you 're being kind . " He walked to the door and she opened it for him and held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beer , the coffee . Maybe I can repay you soon . " " No need to . I 'm glad you rescued me from the party . " " You rescued me , " he said . " Anyway , tomorrow I 'll probably have changed my mind about everything I 've said , and I 'll regret it terribly . " " Well , I wo n't draw faces on my letters any more . " " Okay , " he said . P.S. leaned forward and kissed her lightly on the cheek . " Good night , Sandy . "  | " Good night . " P.S. found his way out of the Hamilton Arms and began walking up 31st toward Q Street . He pictured Sandy getting undressed and going to bed and he wondered whether or not he 'd call her again . He was already beginning to feel a little bit embarrassed by his pretentiousness , his pompousness during the evening , telling her not to draw faces on letters . She had seemed niceenough . And God knows it was better than sitting around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little girl . . . Nice figure , not very bright , but what the hell ? ... What was her name ? Frommer ? . . . Probably not in the phone book . He reached forhis cigarettes and suddenly noticed he had forgotten his coat . Oh , for God 's sake ! I left it at Sandy 's ! There was a slight flickerof lightning and a rumble of thunder and the wind began pickingup . He hurried down 31st Street . Stupid jerk , forgettingyour coat  --  your coat ! My God , how can I forget something as big as a coat ? . . Maybe Sandy hung it on the door for me . . . No , she probably heard the thunder . She knows it 'll probably rain , so she would n't put it outside . . . Maybe she does n't know I forgot it . But she must have noticed it , it was on the chair by the couch . She would have had to move the chair to open up the couch into a bed . A bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that negligee ... Maybe she knew I 'd left the coat behind and did n't say anything so I 'd come back for it . . . Maybe she thinks I really am a sex fiend and I left it behind deliberately . . . My God , she probably does , the coat 's so goddam big . Only a sex fiend could forget a coat that big ! . . . She 's there waiting for me . In that negligee ... " Hi , Sandy , I forgot my coat , pretty stupid of me , " and she would be kind of sitting up on one elbow in that negligee and she 'd know I 'm not so fiendish and she 'd say something like , " Hi , I 'm glad you came back ... " and then because it will be raining she 'll say , " You ca n't go back out in the rain ... " and I 'll look miserable , but game . . . I 'd say something like , " I do n't mind the rain ... " and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on a night like this . . . maybe you 'd better stay here , " and then she 'll move over in the day bed and . . . " Gang busters ! " he said to himself . He reached the entrance of the Hamiltonp203Arms just as the first drops of rain began to fall and threaded his way through the narrow alley until he came to the outside stairs leading up to her apartment . Just as he reached the stairs P.S. saw her door open , a quick flash of red light , and a man entered her apartment , the door swinging shut behind him . What the hell ? P.S. thought . He tiptoed up the stairs and heard Sandy 's voice saying , " I thought you 'd never get here ! " Then there was silence and the man said , " Why did you wait so long before you called ? " " I had a visitor , " Sandy said and P.S. stood there on the top stair , frozen , listening . " Who ? " " A boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so what ? Let 's " No , wait , listen , " Sandy was saying . " You 've got to hear this . He was a real nut . Listen , let me tell you what he said ... " " Ca n't it wait until morning ? " " No , this is too good . The first thing he asked me was if I prayed . " Oh , God .. . " Is there any beer left ? " the man asked . " Sure , in the icebox . " P.S. could hear the icebox door open and then the sound of a can of beer being pierced . It began to rain , large drops splashed on the wooden steps leading up to the girl 's apartment . P.S. sat down on the top step and hunched up his shoulders and rested his elbows on his knees . " And then , Bill , he asked me  --  he practically came right out and asked me if I was a virgin . " " What did you tell him ? " the man asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said that he could tell by the way a woman walked whether or not she was a virgin and then , and then , now listen to this , this 'll kill you . He  --  " She started to laugh . " He told me to dot my i 's ' ? " " Your eyes ? " " In letters when I write letters he said I should n't put circlesp204over the i 's ' I should dot them . . . and , and he said  --  " she was laughing harder now  --  " he said I should n't draw faces on letters . " " Draw what ? " " Faces . . . you know , pictures . " " Oh , for Chrissake . " There was a pause and the man asked , " How old was he ? " " Twenty-four . . . he said he was twenty-four . " " Where 'd you find him ? " " At that party . He took me to dinner after you passed out . " " I did n't pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , come on , Billy . . . " " I did . I fell asleep . You know how little I slept last night ... " The girl laughed again and P.S. sat on the top step , the rainsoaking his shirt , his hair wet and flattened on his head , hishands covering his face . " Hey , " the man 's voice said , " this his coat ? " " He forgot it . He 'll come back for it . That means I have to see him again . " " Throw it out . " " I ca n't do that ! . . . Oh , and , hey , listen to what else he said . He said that  --  he had a real thing about congressmen . . . He said all congressmen were crooks and only interested in themselves and  --  " " Shit , " the man said . " And he asked me about the meaning of life . He wanted to know the meaning of life . " I did not ! P.S. thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus , will you listen to that rain ! " the man said . " I hope it rains all night . I love to sleep in the rain . . . Hey , I got a new record today . You want to hear it ? " " What are you going to do about his coat ? It 's got his wallet in it and papers . " " Leave it , he can get it when he comes by in the morning . " " In the morning ! " the man protested . " He 'd better not come by too early ! " " Well , he needs his wallet , does n't he ? "  | " Did he say how early he 's coming by in the morning ? " " No , of course not , he did n't know he 'd forgotten his coat , silly . But I 'm sure it 'll be in the morning . . . . He seemed so lonely . " The music started playing again and , even if he had wanted to , P.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He got up from the top step and walked down , then back through the alley and out onto the sidewalk . Because he was soaking wet already he knew there was n't any point in hurrying back to the apartment  --  in hurrying back home.  |p206THE  TUESDAY MORNING MAIL contained a letter from the CIA ( with the letterhead folded down so that the print would not be legible through the envelope ) , telling him to report to Building 4133 , Room 117A , at 0930 hrs , Wednesday , 29 June 1960 . There was also a postcard from his father saying , " Welcome home , chum ! Must clear up few items then will return PhiladelphiaJuly 1 . See you then ? " P. S. Wilkinson carried the mail back up to his apartment . He sat down at his desk and could still smell the bacon he had cooked for breakfast two hours earlier . He reread the letter from the CIA , smiling slightly at the elaborate security precaution of a special fold in the letter , and wondered why they bothered to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see it . He telephoned Sandy Frommer and arranged to pick up his coat . She was very cheery on the telephone and so sorry that she would not be able to see him when he came by , but she would leave the door open and his jacket was on one of the batwing chairs next to the couch . P.S. thanked her and hung up , grateful that he would not have to see her again . Did I spend all that time in Korea to come back to this ? He leaned forward against the desk , the drawer pressing against his diaphragm as he stared down at the blotter . Why did I even go out to dinner with her ?  |p207Because  I hoped it might be fun , because she was an alternative , because when she was at the party I could see her thigh abovethe stocking . . . He remembered coming up behind her at her apartment . He remembered putting his hands on her hips and her turning around and saying , " No funny stuff , " and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become of me ? What did I even bother to come back for if I ca n't do any better for myself than this ? Than a Sandy Frommer with silverbluefingernails and red bulbs in her apartment . . . . Is this all the goddam " fun " I 've been looking forward to ? Is this the sort of stupid goddam thing I 'm going to be doing for the rest of my life ? Running after little half-assed Sandy Frommers ? And heknew the rage he felt for Sandy Frommer was no more than a cover-up for the fury he felt for himself . But there was n't anythinghe could do . He could continue to see Hilary , but forwhat ? To what end ? My God , I did n't spend all that time in Korea just to come back and get married either ! He decided to windowshopdown Wisconsin Avenue , then go to Sandy 's apartment , pick up his coat , and come back . He wanted to be certain to miss her . After P.S. had picked up his jacket he took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downtown until he got tired and took a taxi to the Smithsonian . He looked at all the old airplanes again , and at the little boys looking at the airplanes , and they depressed him ; so he crossed to the National Gallery and looked at the young girls looking at the paintings . He had always heard that a museum was the place to find pretty girls , but all the pretty girls really were looking at the paintings , and were not looking for anything else , and he did n't know how to start up a conversation with any of them , and did n't really want to start up a conversation with any of them , and so he left the museum and returned to his apartment . He lay back in the bathtub , then slid down as far as he could , bracing his legs against the far wall so that he could let the water lap against his chin . It reminded him of the tubs in Korea and Lieutenant Pratt . Atleast Pratt had something real to come home to . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... And he remembered being jealous of Pratt and thinking how marriage must be so pleasant . Pratt had asked P.S. why he did n't get married , and P.S. had laughed and said there was plenty of time and that he wantedto have fun . But what the hell kind of fun am I having ? .. . What am I going to do with all that time ? Maybe Hilary 's right . Maybe she should get a divorce and we would get married . ... But what about Hester ? . . . It 's that damn child ; if it were n't for that baby then it would n't be so bad . . . . What could I possibly do with a child ? . . . Yet , if it were n't for Hilary then I 'd really be alone . . . . P.S. wished he could see his brother . Hewished he could call up his brother in Hawaii , but he did n't know where to find him . And there was his sister , but she wasmarried and had children and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's married now , and P.S. knew that the days of running around with Charlie were over . At least they 're overuntil I get married , and we can be young-marrieds , or whatever they 're called , together .... Everybody else is gone . Wally 'll be back on his destroyer , Gurdey , Nelson , and French are all out of the country . . . . There really is n't anybody around now .. . No real friend . . . There 's only Hilary . . . Maybe the only way to get back to  --  what is it , reality ? Meaning ? Maybe the only way for me to get out of this mess is to say , " Okay , Hilary , we 'll get married " ... but that child ! There must be some other way ! ... And maybe Hilary 's changed her mind . . . . She certainly changed her mind yesterday ; there we were all ready to make love and zip ! she ran away . . . . Well , I ran away the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to take it slowly ... . Maybe if we just do n't rush , everything will be all right . P.S. gotout of the bathtub and walked into the bedroom to catch the 6:30 news . He turned on the television and a commercial told him to guard against Pain ! Pain ! Pain ! Monotonous Pain ! After the news and after he had finished dressing he sat down at the desk and looked at the telephone . He got up again , found himself a cigarette , and carried it back to the desk with him . He lit the cigarette , centered the ashtray on the middle of thep209desk blotter , then dialed Hilary 's number . She answered on the third ring . " Hi , it 's Phil . How are you ? " " Fine , " she said . Her voice was very low and soft . " Where are you ? " " At the apartment . Look , what I 'm calling about is that I feelso stupid about yesterday . I wanted to apologize and  --  " " I tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Wherewere you ? " " I went to some silly party where I met some awful girl ... . Hilary ? I want to see you . Ca n't we just take it easy and go out to a movie or something ? " " I ca n't . I have the baby . " " What about the sitter ? " " It 's her night off . " " Oh , damn . . . . There 's a Bogart at the Georgetown and I thought it would be nice .. . " " I 'd love to , Phil , but I ca n't leave Hester . " " We could n't sort of take her along ? " " She 's much too young . Anyway , I swore I 'd never take a baby into a movie . " " I really wanted to see you tonight . " He rolled the cigarette ash into the ashtray and pushed it around with the tip of his cigarette . Then he rested both elbows on the desk . He was holding the telephone in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his forehead . He was trying to think what to do . " You could come over here , " she said . " We could watch television . " " Anything good on ? " " Tuesday night ? ... Tuesday night there is n't much . . . . Have you had dinner ? " " I had hoped we might get something before the movie . " " I 've already eaten , I ate early with Hester .... Why do n't you grab yourself a bite and come on over ? " " I feel I 've sort of invited myself . I  --  " " No , do n't be silly . " " Well , that 's awfully ni  --  "  | " Oh , for God 's sake , hurry , will you ! I 've missed you . " " Ah , Hilary , that 's so nice to hear , " he said . " I 've missed you , too , so very much . I 'll be over as soon as I can . " P.S. hung up the telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sat back at the desk . He looked at his cigarette burning in the ashtray , the smoke rising unperturbed toward the ceiling , then he stubbed it out and walked into the bedroom . He was happy again , and he chose a bright striped tie , and used a gold tie pin to keep his collar in place . He splashed some Old Spice on his cheeks , checked his pockets , patting them to make sure he had his lighter and keys , then he hurried back through the living room , the kitchenette , and out of the apartment . Twenty minutes later he pushed Hilary 's doorbell . " It 's open ! " P.S. walked inside . " Where are you ? " " Kitchen . " He walked through the dining room and into the kitchen . Hilary was heating some coffee and she turned when he came in . " I thought you might like some , " she said . He kissed her lightly on the cheek . " Hi . " " Hi . " She looked at him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter ? " " I 'm just glad to see you . " " Then why do you look so sad ? " " Sad ? Do I ? " " A little . " " I guess I am , a little . " " Why ? " he asked . " Because I love you . " " I love you , too .... That does n't make me sad . It 's the only thing that keeps me from hanging myself , " he said and tried to smile . Hilary suddenly looked frightened and she clung to him , squeezing him , burying her head against his shoulder . " Hey , hey , hey , " P.S. said , " we ca n't go through this all overagain. "  | " I love you , " Hilary said . " I love you and it scares me . . . . I tried to call you last night to tell you . " " Can you tell me now ? " " Not here . Not in the kitchen . Let 's sit down in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to her and took a sip of his coffee , then put the cup and the saucer on the coffee table . " What did you want to tell me ? " Hilary took his hand and began squeezing it nervously . " I used to think  --  when I discovered , no , that is n't the right word . . . " She let go of his hand and started again . " When I finally admitted to myself that I did n't love Bruce , I used to think that it did n't matter . That Bruce and I could stay married and that maybe in time we could grow to love each other the way , I guess the way couples did in arranged marriages . . . . And for Hester it would be all right , she would grow up with both of her parents and be happy  --  but I do n't know any more . Today I was so miserable , I missed you so much that I knew Bruce and I could never  --  I could n't be happy knowing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young and could n't have you . . . . And I know it is n't going to work out with Bruce now , " she said . She picked up his hand , then dropped it again . " It 's only a matter of time . " P.S. took her hand and squeezed it . " I do n't know what to say . . . I wish there was some easy sort of thing I could say , but there is n't . " He held her hand , awkwardly pushing his fingers through hers until he noticed that his fingers were resting on her wedding ring . " The whole thing , the whole thing , Hilary , is this thing about time . There 's been so little time  --  " " We 've known each other for how long ? How many years ? Two years , two and a half years at college and all the time afterwards ? " " It 's not only us , Hilary , I 'm not only talking about us . It 's everything . Everything that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have any control . Everything 's happening in spite of me . . . it 's all happened so fast that it 's  --  all I can think of is that my trunk has n't even got back from Korea yet . "  | " But your job ? " she said . " You 'll have that job with the CIA . " " Well , I guess if I get the job then a lot of my problems are solved . " " But what about us ? " " But , Hilary , we ca n't just rush right into everything . I mean , we have to be a little realistic . Please , Hilary , please try to understand this . . . I 've got to have a little time . All I want to do is take it easy for a little longer . . . And yet everybody seems to be pushing and rushing . I 'd like to relax . " " You wo n't be able to , " she said . That was the kind of smug remark which infuriated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much better than he knew himselfand that she could look down at him from her Olympian perch and guide him through the stages of life . " What makes you think I wo n't ? " " You just wo n't . You are n't the type of person who can just sit around and coast . " " What makes you so sure ? " he asked , still irritated . " Because I know you , " she said . " In the first place , your family would n't let you just coast . They , especially your father , would  --  " " Oh , for God 's sake ! " " Phil , I 'm not being mean when I say that . Look , you 've always done what your family wanted you to do . I remember you once telling me that someone in your family had been an officer in our Army for every war this country ever fought . Did it ever occur to you not to be an officer ? " " Sure , but what would be the point ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what are you getting at ? " P.S. had the uneasy feeling that he was being cross-examined . " What is all this about ? It 's obvious that you are n't just talking about the Army . What is it you 're really after ? " " I remember how toward the end of your final year at Yale there was some problem of whether or not you were going to get commissioned because of your eyes . And you had to get a waiver to stay in , right ? " " I 'd already spent four goddam years in the ROTC and to havep213to chuck it all away at the end seemed kind of stupid . " " But what about your eyes ? You were disqualified from the service because of your eyes , were n't you ? In fact you never had to go into the Army at all . " " So that 's what you 're driving at . " " You did n't have to volunteer for Korea . " He got up from the couch and strode across the room , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hilary , you 're not going to try to tell me that I volunteered for Korea to please my family 1 " " You know why you went there as well as I do . " " I know why I went , but I do n't know why you think I went . " " You think you went because you wanted to see whether or notthe Korean War was worth it . But what was the real reason ! " " The real reason ! You just gave the real reason ! " " Was n't it because you wanted to run away from your family and me ? " " From you ! From you ! " Suddenly P.S. felt himself become entirely detached from the argument . " Hilary ... Hilary , please do n't try to tell me that I went to Korea  --  that I spent five hundred and forty-seven days in Korea  --  to escape from you . The reason I went to Korea was  --  and maybe this does n't sound very important to you  --  but the reason I went was because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War had been my generation'swar . And I wanted to see if the thirty-three thousand Americans killed there had died for something worthwhile . " " In other words , you had a good , a great  --  a decent excuse , an honorable excuse to run off . " " RUN OFF ! " P.S. shouted . " Just what in the hell was I running off from ! My God , two weeks after I arrived in Korea you were married . " " Why do you think I got married ! " she cried , rising from the couch . " I do n't know ! " he said . She ran from the room and he was left behind . " Hilary ... " he said . " Hilary ? " You 're the only thing I 've got left . P.S. started up the stairs . . . What can I say to her ? What , what in God'sp214name does she expect me to do ? At the top of the stairway P.S. looked to see which bedroom Hilary was in . He found her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facing on the street . She was lying on her stomach , her face buried in the pillow . All the lights were on in the room . " Hilary ... " She did not answer . P.S. entered the bedroom and sat down on the side of the bed near her and touched her shoulder . " Hilary ... " He began to stroke her shoulder absent-mindedly . " Hilary , I 'm sorry . . . . Honest , please believe me . " She still did not answer . He leaned over so that his arm rested on the other side of her , his side touching her back . He continued to move his hand across her shoulders . " Hilary , please do n't cry . " He looked up and away from her and saw that the curtains had not been drawn across the windows and anyone in the houses across Prospect Street could look right into the bedroom . He got up and pulled the curtains . Hilary had rolled over and was watching him . He smiled at her and said , " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's some on my dresser . And turn off that top light , will you ? It 's terribly bright . " P.S. picked up the box of tissues , then walked over to the door and turned off the overhead light , then he sat down on the bed next to Hilary and gave her the Kleenex . Hilary pushed herself up and turned her head away to blow her nose . Then she pushed the box aside and , still sitting up in bed , smiled at P.S. " I 'm a mess , are n't I ? " " We 're both pretty messy , " he said . " But I love you . " " Even with my hair all mussed , the mascara running , lipstick all bitten off ? " P.S. picked up another tissue and wiped away the smudged mascara . " You 're lovely no matter what . " " Come here , " she said . She held out her arms to him and he moved closer to her and held her . They held each other tightly and Hilary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " I 'm sorry I was so awful . " " I 'm the one who 's awful . " " If I 'm a bitch it 's only because I love you so much . " She sank back in the bed so that she was lying flat . " Stretch out next to me . I want to feel you next to me . " They lay down on the bed together , still holding each other tightly . " Do you want to turn the lights out ? " she asked . " Not all of them . " He got up from the bed . As he walked across to turn off one of the lights Hilary got off the bed also . She stood with her back to him and unbuttoned her dress . He watched as she pulled her arms out of the dress and let it drop to the floor . Then , still with her back to him , she reached behind herself and undid the catches of her brassiere , and P.S. had the uncomfortablefeeling that again the initiative had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to decide for himself . She lay down on the bed again wearing her panties and the unhooked brassiere . P.S. undressed down to his underpants and lay down on the bed next to her . There was an unfamiliar warmth and discomfort in his temples , not a blush , nor anger , but a curious uneasiness which he could not explain . He reached out and pulled Hilary against him and touched her bare back with his hand , ran his hand down her back across her buttocks , her hip to her thigh . He heard her sigh , felt her push herself against him , felt her hand on his side , his hip  --  felt these things as though they were happening not to himself but to someone else in his body . He again saw himself standing apart watching himself . " You have a nice chest , " she said . She moved away from him slightly and ran her hand across his chest . Then she lowered her head and kissed him in the hollow below his collarbone . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . " He felt himself smiling , and he moved his hand up to touch her cheek and then he kissed her . He pressed his leg between hers and she opened her legs slightly and pushed herself close against him again . He was aware of the fabric of her brassiere against his chest and he ran his hand up her side and held herp216breast , his fingers brushing across the brassiere . She pushed her shoulders together and he pulled the brassiere away and she quickly pushed herself against him half in embarrassment , half in eagerness to feel his warmth against her . She raised her leg and pinned his thigh between hers and the warmth in his temple became worse . And when , several minutes later , they lay nude , the whole length of their bodies touching , he could feel his hand behind her clutching the sheet tightly , his fingers gnarled and strained squeezing the wrinkled sheet . He felt her hand move down his side to his stomach and he squeezed hiseyes shut . Oh , God . . . God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch him and then , in surprise , touch him again , and knew her question even before she asked , " What 's the matter with you ? Why are n't you ... ? " " I do n't know , " he said , his voice showing his misery . " I do n't know . I ca n't  --  it wo n't  --  I do n't know what 's the matter . . . He thought his temples were going to explode , the heat was so intense . " Oh , God , " Hilary said . Her voice was cold and flat . She rolled over onto her back away from him and their bodies no longer touched . He took his arm away from her and lay on his stomach his hands against his face , his fingers pushing against his templestrying to squeeze out the heat , the shame . And his hands became fists , the knuckles pressing into his cheekbones , his teeth clenched so tightly his jaw ached . He did not dare open his eyes to look at her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her frustration , her anger  --  worse , her own embarrassment and shame . And he did n't know what to say . There was nothing  --  no way he could explain to her that if he could , if there was some way that he could , he would make love to her . But the other self , the self which had stood apart and watched , was now inside again and in control and would not let him . All he could do was to repeat again those miserable meaningless words , " I 'm so sorry . " " Well , I guess we might as well get dressed , " she said . He thought she had tried to inject lightness into her tone and hadp217missed . Instead of joviality , her tone had been harsh and cold . He felt her get up from the bed and go to her side of the room . He heard the rustle of clothing as she kicked the brassiere over to her dress . And he , too , got up , unable to face her . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was because we were wrong , that we ca n't  --  if only my goddam body would n't listen to my mind ! They dressed not looking at each other , he wanting nothing more in the world than for her to come to him and touch him . Hilary finished first and hurried out of the bedroom saying , " I 'll fix some more coffee . " " Fine , " he said . P.S. sat down on the bed again and put on his socks and shoes , then got up and walked over to the mirror and brushed his hair . When he came back downstairs to the kitchen , Hilary was just pouring the coffee . " I forgot you wanted to see Hester , " she said . " No , that 's all right . It 's late . I 'll just drink this cup of coffee and go . " " Whatever you say . " " Hilary , please , do n't be angry . . . It 's not  --  it was n't your fault . I 'm sorry it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forget about it , " she said . " Really . It 's all right . It does n't matter . " " Jesus , God , I wish it did n't . " They finished their coffees in silence , and then P.S. stood up and said , " I guess I 'd better be going . " Hilary carried the cups and saucers over to the sink and stood there with her back to him . " Good-by , " she said . " Sleep well . " " I 'll call you tomorrow . " " Okay . "  |p218WEDNESDAY  MORNING , the 29th of June , P. S.Wilkinson dejectedly got out of the taxi and walked across the street to Building 4133 . He entered the building and walked past two uniformed policemen and up to the desk . There was a dumpy , gray-haired woman sitting there reading a paperback novel and he stood submissively in front of her , patiently waiting for her to look up . Finally she folded over the corner of a page , closed the book and said , " Yes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told to report to room 117A . " " What is your name ? " " Philip Sadler Wilkinson , " he repeated without inflection . " May I see your identification ? " He opened his wallet and showed her his driver 's license . She carefully copied his name down in the space on the chart in front of her , then said , " Room 117A is down the corridor to the right . Third door . Report to the secretary at the desk as you enter . " " Thank you , " he answered mechanically , but she had already opened her book and was reading again . P. S. Wilkinson walked down the corridor and stopped at the entrance to Room 117A . A few people were sitting on the peeling sofas flipping through copies of Reader 's Digest and Saturday Evening Post . He walked up to the desk . This secretary was younger than the other , and instead of reading a paperback book she was doing a crossword puzzle.  | " My name is Wilkinson . Philip Sadler Wilkinson . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilkinson , just a minute , please . " He again waited submissively while the young woman checked through a mimeographed sheet of names and then saw her put a mark beside his . She pulled out a small mimeographed card and handed it to him . " Read this carefully , " she said . " Then sign . " " Yes , ma'am . " P.S. took the card back to the sofa with him and sat down to read it . It was a standard release form stating that the undersigned was willing to submit to a polygraph test the results of which would be kept in the strictest confidence . A liedetector ! Do they give these things to everybody ? He looked atthe others seated around the room and wondered if they , too , were waiting to be given lie detector tests . The card further stated that if the undersigned were unwilling to submit to a lie detector test his application would be considered canceled . Everyoneknows that a polygraph is not infallible , that it 's not admissibleas evidence . . . P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the secretary . " Thank you , " she said . " Be seated and you will be called when the examiner is ready . " " Thank you , " P.S. said . He went back to the sofa and sat down and dejectedly crossed his legs . He looked around the room at the furniture , which appeared to have come out of old military day rooms , the stacks of old magazines , the bored faces of the others waiting to be pried into . He reached into his breast pocket and pulled out a cigarette and lit it . " I 'm sorry , sir . There 's no smoking . " P.S. looked vainly for an ashtray . " Where can I put it out ? " " You 'll have to take your cigarette out in the hall . " He stood up and walked out of the room and back down the corridor toward the dumpy secretary he had seen when he first entered . She did not look up until he pushed out his cigarette in her ashtray and when she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the room . He sat down again on the sofa , picked at a copy of the Reader 's Digest , and closed it because he could not think of anything but the horror of the evening with Hilary.  |p220He  felt awful , depressed , totally demolished . He felt so ashamed of himself , so embarrassed . He tried to convince himself that the only reason it had happened was because he was tired . But it had never happened to him before and he wondered what it meant . Whether even his body was deserting him , leaving him alone and trapped with his mind . Why did my mind permit meto go so far with her  --  far enough to get into bed with her , to get to the point where I could not make love to her ? What 's the matter with me ? Why did it happen ? Hilary 's so pretty . She has such a marvelous body . . . Could n't help but want to . . . Weekendsat college . . . All those times . . . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same , she was n't the same .... Oh , God , why ? And she asked what was the matter with me . The way she asked itl As though I were a homosexual . A queer . A fairy ! " Mr. Wilkinson ? " P.S. looked up at the secretary who was sitting behind the desk . " Yes ? " " You can go in now . It 's Room 4 . Through the door and second room on your right . " " Thank you , " he said . He wondered why he had been put ahead of the others , or whether it might not be possible that a couple of them were " plants " put there to watch his reaction , to see if he was nervous . But none of them were even looking athim . Why not ? Is n't it logical that at least one of them would be looking at me ? Somebody moves in a room , others usuallylook up . . . . He looked at the secretary . She was doing her crosswordpuzzle again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He walked down the narrow corridor to the second door on the right . There was a small lettered sign on it beneath a red light bulb : BOOTH# 4 . POSITIVELY NO ADMITTANCE WHILE BULB IS LIT . P.S. knockedon the door . " COME IN ! " The loudness of the voice startled him . It seemed to have come from overhead and he looked up and saw the small loudspeaker . P.S. opened the door and stepped inside . " Close the door behind you , please . Make sure it is tightly shut . " P.S. closed the door hard and heard the latch click . When he turned back , the first thing he noticed was the polygraphp221machine . A long , black rectangular box with dials , scopes , pens attached to thin wires , a long roll of graph paper . As though deference had been paid to its importance , the machine took up most of the long side of the reverse L-shaped desk . The shorter leg of the L was covered with papers and on top of the papers P.S. saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Wilkinson ? " " That 's right , " P.S. said . " Good morning . My name is Williams . Have you ever taken a polygraph test before ? " " No , I have n't . " Williams remained seated behind his desk and P.S. detachedly compared Williams ' features with his own stock image of the harsh Nazi interrogator . Williams did not match up at all , except perhaps for the lips . Williams ' lips were full and a little wet  --  but not as full and wet as the drooling stock interrogator 's should be . Williams was leafing through P.S. 's personal history form . P.S. looked around the small room . It was certainly no more than twelve feet long and eight feet wide . There were no windows . No pictures . No ornaments . The four walls and the ceiling were covered by soundproofing boards . There were two chairs , one occupied by Williams , enclosed on two sides by the reverse L-shaped desk . The other chair , the one in which Wilkinson was to sit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the machine and the interrogator , and that by stretching slightly his legs could touch the forward wall . There was nothing in the room to distract his attention  --  except the machine . High up in the back wall , an air conditioner whispered softly . The light in the room was good , not harsh or glaring . Wilkinson looked down at the chair in which he was to sit . The right arm of the chair was worn slightly , reminding him of the chair in which he had been seated while facing the Honor Committee at the Virginia Preparatory School , and he felt his heart begin to race . " Please sit down , Mr. Wilkinson . " " Thank you . " P.S. sat in the chair in front of the desk . It felt a bit awkward to be facing away from the man , and he startedp222to turn the chair , but discovered it was bolted to the floor . " There will be no smoking , " the man said into the back of P.S. 's head . " The nature and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the statements you have made on your personal history form are the truth . We use the polygraph , or lie detector machine , to provide the immediate disclosure of facts which under normal circumstances and methods of investigationmight take weeks or possibly months . Therefore , the immediateadvantage of the lie detector is that it saves time . " Wilkinson nodded . " Of course the most important object of this test is to penetrate the outer defenses of lies . Many repressed ideas and emotionswhich the subject might not even be aware of , which he might have succeeded in deceiving his conscious self about , can be discovered by means of the lie detector test . Many people come away from these tests with a new appreciation of themselves , a new understanding of their personalities , for the machine serves to strip away disguises , mental masquerades , deceptions  --  selfdeceptions  --  andthe power to deceive . It acts , therefore , as a purgative to the personality , freeing it from all conflicts , repressions , withdrawals , twisted truths , distortions , and leaves the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out ? " P.S. said dully . " We do n't brainwash here , " Williams said . There was no lightnessin his tone . " This machine serves only to determine whether or not the subject is telling the truth about any given matter . " " But it 's not infallible , " P.S. protested . " Everyone knows that lie detector evidence does n't stand up in court . " " This is not a court , Mr. Wilkinson . The machine does not gather evidence . It merely documents responses and provides a means of gauging a subject 's reaction to certain questions . It is up to the examiners to determine the meaning and significanceof the subject 's responses . The polygraph records certain bodily changes such as changes in respiration , pulse , blood pressure . The polygraph will not cause you any pain except , perhaps , for a slight discomfort caused by the tightness of the blood pressure cuff . In addition to the polygraph , we employp223the psychogalvanograph , which is designed to measure electrodermalresponses . " " Measure what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The **26;6230;TOOLONG the amount of perspiration , constriction of the pores , the electrical resistance of the skin . . . Now do n't let the word electrical ' bother you . The amount of electricity used is so slight the subject never is aware of it . " " Good , " Wilkinson said . He knew he was getting nervous , and he tried to calm himself by thinking about something other than the test . But all he could think of was his failure of the evening before . " If you are telling the truth , " Williams continued , " then you do n't have a thing in the world to worry about . And this instrumentwill indicate when you are telling the truth as well as when you are n't . If you do tell the truth , then it will be known . If you are n't telling the truth , as I 've said , the machine will show it and I 'll tell you so , and I 'll ask you to let me hear the truth .... That 's fair enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't mind taking this test , do you ? " " No , I guess not . Do anything you want . Help yourself . " " Fine , " Williams said . " Now I 'm going to attach the blood pressure cuff . Do n't worry . Everyone 's a little nervous at first , and it wears off . If there are any problems , we 'll just go over them again until they 're solved , okay ? " " Yes . " Williams got up from behind the L-shaped desk and walked around to Wilkinson . " You 'll have to remove your jacket . You can hang it on that hook behind my desk , and roll up your left sleeve all the way , please . " Wilkinson hung up his coat . There was just the one hook . He noticed his hand was shaking slightly as he unbuttoned his cuff . Then he rolled up his sleeve as high as he could and sat down in the chair again . Williams wrapped the blood pressure sleeve around his arm and buckled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and P.S. looked down at the hose that was being looped across his chest . The hose was ribbed , andp224looked like a smaller version of one of the hoses found in an automobile . " Just one thing more , " Williams said . He slid a spring and soft rubber " bracelet " over Wilkinson 's fingers , and then he went back to the desk and pumped up the blood pressure cuff until it was almost painfully tight . The next thing P.S. heard was the click of the machine being turned on , and he involuntarilystiffened . There was the light hum of the motor which unrolledthe graph paper . P.S. heard Williams move his chair , then there was the sound of a pencil being picked up . Was it a pencil ? A faint scratching sound . The pens moving on the graph paper ! It 's started ! The cuff was so tight he could feel his own pulse beating in his arm . He took a deep breath and heard the pen move sharply . " I 'm sorry , " P.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The room was silent for half a minute . " Now , Mr. Wilkinson , I am going to begin the test by asking you several questions which should be answered by either a yes or a no answer . If you have any qualifying remarks we can discuss them afterwards . " Wilkinson nodded . He tried to concentrate on the facing wall . But his eyes would not focus on the dotted soundproofing panels . " Is your name Philip Sadler Wilkinson ? " " Yes . " ( Pause . ) " Are you twenty-four years old ? " " Yes . " " Are you residing at the Connecticut Avenue Hotel ? " " No , I 've moved . I 'm living at ... " " That 's enough . I told you I only want yes or no answers . " Wilkinson heard the man stop the machine . He tore off the portion of graph paper used so far , then threaded the new portion in . Before he started up the machine again he asked , " You 've moved where ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right . But from now on only yes and no answers . If there 's anything you feel you want to add , we can cover it afterwards . Now , I 'm going to start the instruments and I want you to remain silent until I ask you questions . "  |p225P.S.  nodded . He heard the machine being turned on again , the sound of the pens moving across the graph paper . There was absolute silence , unbroken but for the mechanical sounds around them , for approximately forty seconds and then P.S. heard Williams shuffle some papers and ask , " Is your name Philip Sadler Wilkinson ? " " Yes . " ( Pause . ) " Are you twenty-four years old ? " " Yes . " ( Pause . ) " Are you an American citizen ? " " Yes . " " Are you residing at 2908 Q Street ? " " Yes .

" " Your brother is living in Hawaii , is n't he ? " " Yes . " " All right , now I want you to be absolutely quiet for thirtyseconds . " P.S. nodded . He listened to the hum of the machine and thep227scratching of the pen . He became aware again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slight tingling in his fingers beneath the spring and rubber " bracelet . " Then the machine was turned off . P.S. leaned back slightly in the chair to stretch his back . Williamslet the air out of the blood pressure cuff , then said , " Let 's talk about these questions concerning classified information which seemed to have bothered you . " " I was with intelligence in Korea and you asked whether or not I 'd ever worked with a foreign government 's intelligence offices . " He felt so detached from this unreality that his own voice surprised him . " If I am to take you to mean have I ever worked under the employ . . . or whether I worked under the direction of a foreign government 's intelligence system , the answer is no . We did work very closely with the Koreans . The Korean intelligence was good . In many ways superior to our own . " " Then what about the classified material ? The question about disclosing classified material to unauthorized persons also gave you trouble . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are n't  --  who do n't need to know what is being done . And yet I 'm sure you 're familiar with the same amount of needless briefings , displays , talks that seem to go on in intelligence offices whenever somebody of some importance passes through . It was common in Korea for intelligence briefings to display more and more knowledge if only to show the people one was briefing that one was important . It may not have been the briefing officer 's wish to do so . But one would be told by his superior to tell an individual about something that that person had no reason  --  no need to know . " " But that is the extent of your disclosure of classified material . You disclosed material when told to do so . And you felt you should n't . " " That 's right . " " Now what about this Top Secret information ? " " What about it ? " " Did you disclose Top Secret information ? "  | " No . I released information which up to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons had been downgraded or which , when separated from other documents , was no longer Top Secret . My reaction to that was simply by association . No matter what the change of classification , the material was of a highly classified nature to me . " " But , again , you were in this instance instructed to do so by the proper military authorities " " That 's right . " " Then , let 's see , Mr. Wilkinson . If I were to rephrase those questions to read something like ... " He paused and P.S. could hear his pencil moving on a piece of paper . " . . . Have you ever disclosed classified material to persons without proper authorizationand without prior clearance from superiors ? ... Would that give you any trouble ? " " I do n't think so , " P.S. said . " The question remaining is about the family outside the country . The anxiety was caused , I assume , by whether or not Hawaii was considered out of the country ? " " Yes , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other than your brother living in Hawaii , are there any members of your immediate family who reside outside the continental limits of the United States ? ' would that give you any problems ? " " No , I do n't think so . " " Fine , " Williams said . P.S. felt him pumping up the blood pressure and pulse sleeve on his upper arm , and then he heard Williams turn on the machine again and lower the pens to the graph paper . " Now , Mr. Wilkinson , I am going to ask you the exact same questions with the exception of those previously noted and changed , and they will be in the exact same order as before . I want you to remain silent for the next thirty seconds and then answer my questions only with a yes or no answer . " P.S. tried to make himself comfortable and waited for the questions to begin . The blood pressure cuff seemed even tighter than before , more uncomfortable . He considered asking Wit/Rams to loosen it , but decided against it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scratching , clicking . " Is your name Philip Sadler Wilkinson ? " " Yes . " " Are you twenty-four years old ? " " Yes . " Ten minutes later the machine was stopped and Wilkinson was told to relax . " Can you loosen the blood pressure thing a little next time ? It was somewhat painful , and tended to distractme from your questions . " " Too tight ? " " That 's right . " " Sure . " " May I smoke ? " Wilkinson asked . " No , there 's no smoking here . This next series of questions is of a more personal nature designed to find out more about the character of the subject . Do n't let them upset you . Everyone who comes in here is asked these questions . I 've asked these questions a thousand times and you 'd be surprised by the answersI get during the discussion periods afterwards . So do n't let them bother you . All right ? " " Yes . " " Good . You ready to go again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the questions he was being asked . With increasing horror he answeredthem and when , after ten minutes , he was told to relax he did not change his position . He could still hear the sound of the drum moving beneath the pens , he could still feel the tightnessof the blood pressure cuff on his arm , and he felt slightly sick to his stomach . " Well , Mr. Wilkinson , would you like to talk about those questions which seemed to give you so much trouble ? " " I do n't know . Which ones do you mean ? " " You know the ones I meant . " " Which in particular ? " " Let 's start with the first one , shall we ? " Wilkinson wondered why the machine was still running . Hep230could hear Williams sorting through some papers and then Williams asked , " Are you a homosexual ? " " No ! " " Have you ever had any homosexual contacts ? " " No . . . no , not that I remember . " " What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the sort of thing that you remember very distinctly . You know whether or not it happened , unless you repress it . There is no such thing as not that I remember . ' . . . Now I 'll turn off the instruments and you can just think about this question . " Wilkinson heard a click . but he could n't be sure that the machine had been turned off . The blood pressure cuff was still very tight on his arm ; he thought he could still hear the drum rolling the graph paper beneath the pens . " I 'll tell you why you 're saying not that I remember . ' It 's because you 're not telling the truth . You find it easier to tell half a lie than a whole one . I know from experience that when a man uses the expression not that I remember ' he 's simply not telling the truth . If he were telling the truth he 'd be able to give a simple yes or no answer and he would n't have to resort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question and the machine would n't show so strong a reaction . " " Well , my God , a strong reaction does n't mean I 'm lying , " P.S. protested . " You asked me if I was a homosexual  --  a queer ! And you expect me to react to that question the same as if you asked me if I liked cream in my coffee . " " I just want to know the truth . That 's all I 'm here for . I 'm not here to pass judgment on you or humiliate you . As I said , these records are kept in strict confidence . I know this sort of questioning is embarrassing . But if you could only think of me as a doctor  --  " " Oh , for Christ 's sake ! " " Look , it 's my job . Nothing you can say could possibly surprise or shock me . I 've listened to thousands of men tell me the same things . All of them thinking that it 's never happened to anyone else . Eighty-five percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or another of homosexual contacts . You 'd be surprisedp231how many . The chances are the thing that is bothering you  --  whatever it may be  --  is something that I 've heard time and time again . All I 'm trying to do is to determine to what extent you 've had homosexual contacts . " " ... Well , nothing more than the usual . " " What 's the usual ? " P.S. gripped the arm of the chair . Jesus , why does he have to ask about these things ? I 've told him I 'm not a queer , what more does he need to know ? " What 's the usual ? " Williams repeated . " Oh , you know ... " Is this how he gets his kicks ? " I do n't know , you tell me . " " A man sitting next to me in a movie , or someone sitting next to me on a train . . . Things like that . " " How many things like that ? " " Those are the only two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But did they excite you ? " " Jesus , no ! Of course not . I got up and moved away from them . I sat somewhere else . " " How old were you ? " " I do n't remember . Sixteen , seventeen ... " " What about before ? " " Nothing . I just told you . That 's all I remember . " " Is that so ? ... I see , " Williams said . " Well , we 'll come back to that later . Now we 'll start the instruments and  --  " " They 've been running all along , " P.S. said . What was thatclick before ? My God , maybe it was to that microphone outside ! Maybe everyone in the hall could listen . Maybe that stupid sonuvabitchmade a mistake . Thought he had turned off the machine and instead turned on the microphone outside ! Would be typical of this goddam place ! " I want you to sit perfectly still for about twenty seconds , just to establish your normal responses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes .

" " Have you , yourself , ever initiated an overt homosexual act ? " " No ! " " Do you prefer the company of women to men ? " .. Well , it depends . " Wilkinson heard Williams swear to himself as he turned off the machine . " Mr. Wilkinson , these are simple yes or no an-swers ! " " Then , yes and no ! I prefer to dance with women but drink with men . There are times when I prefer the company of women over men and men over women . " " All right , we 'll eliminate that question entirely . " " Okay with me . " " I 'm starting the instruments again . . . Be still . . . Now , answer these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . all right , Mr. Wilkinson . Is your date of birth 12 April 1936 ? " " Yes .

Jesus , how can I  --  " " Look , if you wo n't cooperate , we 're going to have to mark you as unfit , or unwilling to submit to polygraph , in which case your application will be canceled . " Williams turned off the machine again . " Well , how the hell do you expect me to answer these questions with a simple yes or no answer ? You do n't ask simple yes or no questions ! You ask , Do you know any homosexuals ? ' And what the hell , do you mean do I know any by name ? Do I know them in the biblical sense ? Are they my best friends ? Do I know them by sight ? What do you mean ? "  | " All right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know any homosexualsmeaning do you hold any homosexuals among your acquaintances . Will that be all right ? " " Fine . Yes . Yes , I do .

Do you hold any homosexuals among your acquaintances ? " " Yes . " " Are any of your closest friends homosexuals ? " " No . " But some of my best friends are Negroes . " Do you know the names of any homosexuals ? " " Yes . " " Have you ever had  --  engaged in homosexual activity with them ? " " No . ' " Are you in the habit of seeing homosexuals ? " " No .

" No. "  | ( Pause . ) " Do you have any habits , perversions , fetishes , which make the sexual act more attractive to you ? " " No .

" Oh , for God 's sake , what an asinine ques " All right ... just sit still for the next thirty seconds . " P.S. sat quiet , feeling the relief , the temporary respite from the questioning wash over him . He heard Williams turn off the polygraph machine , and the rustle of papers . P.S. looked down at his left hand and noticed that his knuckles were white from the strain of gripping the chair seat . Williams pushed back his chair and came around to P.S. 's side and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off P.S. 's hand . P.S. massaged his arm and hand , then took a deep breath and leaned back against the hard wood chair . " How do you feel ? " Williams asked . " Fine . " " Not too tired ? " " Not really . It 's almost interesting  --  in an awful way . " Williams seated himself in the chair behind the desk and Wilkinson again . " In what way is it awful ? "  | " I do n't know , " P.S. said . " It 's just like  --  it 's sort of something out of Kafka . Being plugged into a machine . Being humiliated by a machine . " " Do you feel humiliated ? " " Well , no , maybe that is n't the word I meant . Not exactly . I just do n't happen to like being examined on the end of the pin like some sort of insect specimen . " " It should n't bother you if you have nothing to hide . " " Well , I do n't . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd like , or if you 'd prefer we can go back over those questions that gave you trouble  --  " " What questions ? " " You know the ones I mean . " " Oh , God , it 's cat-and-mouse time again . . . . Well , let 's go at it again . Turn it on again . " " I do n't think that 's really necessary , do you ? " Williams asked . " I mean , we can both pretty well tell when you 're lying without the machine , ca n't we ? " " Can we ? " " I think so , " Williams said smoothly . P.S. wished he could have a cigarette . " One of the questions which gave you difficulty was . . . let 's see . . . Prior to the time you were sixteen or seventeen years old , did you ever engage in any homosexual activity ? ' " " I told you no ! " " Not even as a small boy at school ? ... You went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school often do things they 're ashamed of later . " " Did you ? " I bet you did , you bastard .

" " This whole problem of homosexuality seems to be bothering you . You have shown strong reactions on every question asked of this nature ; now I want you to know why . I want the truth . "  |p236How  do you explain to a man of this type that the whole prep school career of a boy is shaded by the other boys ' acceptance of his manhood , his masculinity . If a boy does too well in school , or if he 's not very good at sports , or if he sticks to himself , the other boys immediately label him a " fairy . " . . . I spent my prep school days being terrified of being called a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So , let 's go back and see what it is that 's been bothering you . If you answer this question with the truth , we can end this examinationquickly . When you were a boy did you ever have any homosexual contact ? " ... All right . Yes . " " Go on . " " Go on ? There 's nothing very much to it . " " Tell me . " " Well , when I was nine . Ten maybe . I do n't know how old I was . It was the beginning of my second year at Napier , so it was  --  I must have been eleven . I was eleven . " " What happened ? " " Nothing much . " There was a long silence and P.S. waited for Williams to ask him more questions , but when it became apparent that Williams was waiting for P.S. to speak , P.S. finally blurted , " I was eleven and it was in the shower and there was a boy who was n't circumcisedand I touched him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all ! " " You 're sure now ? That 's all you did ? " " I just told you that 's all . " " And that was your only overt homosexual act ? " " Well , I do n't think that just because an eleven-year-old boy is curious , he should necessarily be labeled queer . " " But why did the question give you so much trouble ? " " I do n't know , " P.S. said . " It 's not something I generally go around telling people about . " " And if I were to ask you , if I were to phrase a question , Other than your touching another boy when you were eleven years old ,  |p237have  you ever committed an overt homosexual act ? ' That questionwould no longer bother you . You would be able to answer yes  --  honestly ? " " Yes . " " All right , " Williams said . It 's all over , P.S. thought to himself . He wanted to smile , to laugh , to pump Mr. Williams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! No more ques " There just seems to be one more region we have n't explored , " Williams said . " The polygraph indicated a very strong reaction to the following question : Have you ever experienced any difficulty in enjoying sex with women ? ' Can you think what might have caused that ? " Hilary ! God damn that machine . " I do n't know why , " P.S. said . " I honestly ca n't think why . " " I do n't need the machine to show me that you 're lying . " " I 'm not lying ! " " All right , let 's attach the blood pressure cuff and the galvanographagain and I 'll ask you the question , then show you the chart . Will that prove to you that you 're lying ? " P.S. sat and looked down at his hands . " I  --  well , last night , I was in bed with a girl and I could n't get an erection . " " Was she colored ? " " Colored ? Why ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many young men from good families pick up colored prostitutesand go to bed with them and find they ca n't get an erection . It 's perfectly normal . They may want to make love to the girl but there are too many social or racial or discriminatory or psychologicalreasons why they are n't able to go through with the act . " " That 's very interesting , " P.S. said , eager to be off the subject . " Was the girl you were in bed with last night colored ? " " No , she was married . " " Was that why you could n't go through with the act ? " " Probably . And I was tired , too , I guess . " " But other than this one time  --  normally you are able to perform the act satisfactorily ? " " Often to the ecstatic applause of the assembled guests . "  | " You have done it in front of other people ? " " No , " P.S. said . " Excuse me . I was being funny . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push his chair back , then come around the desk . He thought for a minute that Williams was going to hit him . P.S. had a sudden vision of the Gestapo interrogator smashingthe prisoner 's teeth in , shouting " Schweinhundl Take dot for being fonny I " but the man was only attaching the blood pressure cuff to P.S. 's upper arm . P.S. slid the galvanograph over his own hand . " Now , I 'm going to ask you the questions in the exact same order as they were given you previously . The questions will be the same except for those we have discussed . I want only yes or no answers . If there are any problems , we will discuss them after the test . " Williams seated himself behind P.S. again and pumped up the blood pressure cuff . " Is that too tight ? " P.S. shook his head . " No . " " All right , relax . " Williams turned on the machine . Once again P.S. could hear the mimeograph roll moving across the drums , then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressingagainst the respiration hose . Williams said , " I want you to remain still for the next twenty seconds . Good . " P.S. could hear a light rustle of papers behind him . " Is your date of birth the 12th of April , 1936 ? " " Yes . " " Were you born in New York City ? " " Yes . " Fifteen minutes later Williams said , " Well , that does it . " " We 're through ? " P.S. could scarcely believe it . " That 's right . " P.S. looked down at his watch . It was only eleven o'clock . He had been inside the small room for just a little over an hour . Williams undid the respiration hose , the blood pressure cuff , and slid the galvanograph off P.S. 's hand . P.S. was terribly conscious of the man 's hand when it had touched his , and he thought of the time that had been spent discussing whether or not he was a homosexual . " How did I do ? " P.S. asked  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass ? Everything all right ? " " It 's too early to tell . I have to go over the test in detail . " " But you do n't think there are any problems ? " P.S. wanted desperately to ask the man if he was thought to be a homosexual . He wanted to make sure that both the man and the machine believed him . " Take this card and go back to the secretary . She will tell you where to go from here . " " There 's more ? " " It 's common for the subjects to go directly from here to the psychiatrist 's office . It 's just a short examination . Part of the routine . " " Well , okay , " P.S. said with enormous relief . He stood up and rolled his left sleeve down and buttoned the cuff . Then he walked over to the coat hook and took down his coat . He put it on , trying not to look at the sheaf of papers on Williams ' desk . He wondered for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examiner , then reached out his hand . Williams shook it , looking somewhat surprised , then walked over and held the door open for P.S. P.S. thanked him and walked up the narrow hallway back into the sitting room and handed the card to the secretary . The secretary made a few notes on it and said , " Go up to the second floor to Room 230 and see Dr. James . " " Room 230 , Dr. James , " P.S. repeated . " That 's right . " P.S. walked up the stairs to the second floor , turned down the corridor labeled 216-230 , and stopped outside Room 230 and knocked . A man said , " Come in . " P.S. walked into the office . A soft , pudgy man with no hair and wearing steel-rimmed glasses was seated behind an enormousmahogany desk which took up almost the whole room . " What 's your name ? " " Wilkinson , sir . " " Hello , Wilkinson . I 'm Dr. James . " " Yes , sir . " His voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you ? "  |p240P.S.  felt the hair rising on the back of his neck . There was something horrible about the man 's voice . Its tone . " Twenty-four , " P.S. said . " You do n't look that old . " A shiver ran through him , and P.S. started to sit down . " No , no ! " the doctor protested . " Do n't sit down yet . Let me look at you . " P.S. remained standing where he was . His skin felt cold and damp . " My , you 're tall ! " the doctor said . " Are you long all over ? "  |p241THE  LIGHTS CAME ON at the end of the secondfeature and Philip Sadler Wilkinson blinked owlishly for a few moments , massaged his temples where the first warning pulses of a headache had made themselves felt , then stood and walked up the aisle . He waited for the couple in front of him to step aside , heard the woman between gum chews say that she thought Doris Day was simply the most wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that anyone would look wonderful and dreamy if they were photographed through eight inches of gauze . P.S. passed them and stood outside the movie theater waiting for the readjustment to reality , waiting for the frothy candy-cotton world of Rock Hudson and Doris Day to become the real world of this lonely Baltimore night , waiting for the memories of Washington to rush back in , engulfing him in the stagnantwash of embarrassment , impotency , innuendo , and despair which culminated in standing once again before the giant desk , facing the fat , pasty-faced , puffy-palmed psychiatrist , seeing the fluorescent lights reflecting in the man 's steel-rimmed spectacles . And again P.S. felt the horror , the nausea as he saw the pursed lips , the pink tongue licking those lips before the psychiatrist said , " My , you 're tall ... " P.S. hurried away from the theater to East Baltimore Street . When he had been first in the Army , stationed outside Baltimore at the Asruy Intelligence School , he had learned to love this streetp242with its bars and strip joints , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner from the Salvation Army 's neon cross which advertised GOD IS LOVE . P.S.loved the street with its cheap clothing stores , its tattoo parlors , its dirty book and magazine stands with rows upon rows of magazine covers depicting mammoth-breasted girls chewing plastic flowers or hayseeds or fingertips while lying upon satin pillows , or bales of hay or rumpled sheets , with all of its books with the slack-faced women in black leather corsets and black leather boots that laced all the way up the thighs , with its women in furs , with its women in silk , with its women in rubber skindivingsuits with special hoods which hid their faces while they whipped men who supposedly did n't mind it at all . East Baltimore Street was the only reality left ; it was P.S. 's last remaining link with his life before Korea . It was where he had known Hippolyte . Hippolyte . . . Polly Hippolyte . P.S. smiled to himself . He really wanted to see her now . He remembered how the master of ceremoniesat the Club 88 would say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special attraction . . . The only woman in the world who was more than a match for Hercules snicker . . . . The one woman whose girdle snicker it was Hercules ' task to steal ! . . . And it was n't supposed to be easy guffaw ! . . . The Club 88 is proud to present the star of its show , the Queen of the Amazons herself . . . HIPPOLYTE ! " And when the m.c. and Polly were quarreling , as was usual , he would introduce her not as Hih-pol-at-tee , but instead he would pronounce it Hippo-lite , and Polly would come on smiling at him and the front tables would hear her say something like , " Go find yourself a poisoned choirboy . " Hippolyte was the star stripper of the Club 88 . Before her performance she would circulate around the nightclub pushing drinks , which was how P.S. had first met her . She used to wear dresses that appeared to have been put on backwards . The cleavage dove down to her belt , exposing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore nothingunder her dress . She kept her black hair very short and streaked with gray to hide her youth . During her act she wore a long black wig . Her nose had been broken and badly set years ago , and her makeup did not entirely hide her freckles . And shep243was a Lesbian , though not as much or not as complete a Lesbian as her girl friend Faith . Faith , Jesus , was she a mean one ! I 'd forgotten all about her . Faith had left her husband and gone to live with Hippolyte . Faith was a true Lesbian with all the meannessand possessiveness of her kind . She would not go to bed with a man unless she desperately needed the money and only for fifty dollars . Which was no bargain . She hated P.S. , hated Hippolyte for liking him . Faith constantly had to be told by Hippolyte that Hippolyte loved her . But Hippolyte was not a true Lesbian , she was AC-DC , and Faith despised and distrusted that side of her . P.S. walked down East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on either side which advertised girls with names like Toni , Jerri , Betti , and Bill ; Torrid , Tawny , Flame , and Blaze ; Cuddles , Cupcakes , Ti-Ti , and Lulu ; Elvesa , Rita , Kim , and Marilyn . There was Virginia ( Ding-Dong ) Bell , and fabulous Irma the Body , and then P.S. was in front of the Gayety Burlesque with its architecture as bawdy as its billboards and its gold paint as chipped as the ticket taker 's teeth . The colored man in the doorman suit three sizes too large was saying , " Showtime ! S howtime ! Showzahboutah begin ! " P. S. Wilkinson with other second lieutenants going to the Army Intelligence School had spent a lot of time at the Club 88 because the acts came faster , there were no awful comedians , and the girl singer was pretty good . No one had ever tried dating any of the girls , since the club had a reputation for Lesbianism . The October evening after P.S. had received his orders for Korea , he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dared him to make a date with Hippolyte . When Hippolyte had sat with them and P.S. had bought her a Scotch , he asked her to go out with him after the show and she said , " It will cost you twenty dollars . " P.S. said that he thought he could afford it and she said , " Come back to my place . Meet me outside the club after the show . You got a car ? " P.S. borrowed the keys to one of the lieutenants ' cars , and after the show he waited around the corner from the club . It was cold that October evening and he had his overcoat collar turned up against the wind and he worried that Hippolyte would pull a no-show . He was about to give up whenp244she came around the corner , linked her arm through his and said , " Okay , let 's go . " P.S. drove her back to her apartment in the borrowed car and parked behind an apartment house not far from the library . They said very little to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn and being told where to stop . Hippolyte lived in a basement apartment and when she held the door open for him and he stepped inside he was speechless . It looked like the whole apartment was filled with books . Bookcases lined one whole wall to the left and books were piled up on the two deep recessed windowsills to the right . Separating the efficiency kitchen from the living room were two more small bookcases also filled with books . P.S. walked around to look at the books and they were n't all trash . There were good paperbacks on poetry and art and a whole section devoted to Greek mythology and history . " Have you read all of these ? " P.S. asked . " A few of them . " P.S. sat down and pulled out the Penguin paperback of the Aeneid . " Is this where you got the idea for your act ? " She smiled . " Well , no , not really . " P.S. had never seen her really smile before . " Vergil never had much to say about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " The Aeneid ? " " My act . " It was P.S. 's turn to smile . " My God , yes . It 's very effective . Particularly your cape work . When you 're down on the floor . I did n't know Amazons wore capes . " " They did n't . They wore togas mostly . Or things that looked like togas in the early pictures or representations of them . They carried bows and spears and things like that . It was n't until later on that they wore thin dresses with high hems so that they could run fast . " " How do you know all this ? " " I read all about them in the Encyclopaedia Britannica . " P.S. sat down on the couch . " Incredible , " he said . " I think you 're the first girl I 've ever met who 's read the **27;6258;TOOLONG . Most people just stick them into bookshelves and forget about them . " " Well , " she laughed , " I have n't read all of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is . " " More like just Amazons . ' " " You mind if I look around for a few minutes ? " P.S. asked . " Unless , of course , it 's too late and you 're tired . What time is it ? " P.S. saw the hardness take over her face . " Look , you want a quick lay we can go back into the bedroom right now . " " Oh , God , I did n't mean that at all . I 'm sorry , " P.S. said . " I just thought that since you 've been working all night you must be very tired and I thought you might want me out of here . " " Okay , " she said . Her expression softened . " Hey , what is your name ? I forget . " " Philip . P. S. Wilkinson . People call me P.S. or Philip or Phil , it does n't matter . " " Which do you prefer ? " " They 're all the same . " " Then I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're in the Army , are n't you ? " " That 's right . " " I 've seen you at the club before . You get to the club pretty often . " " Well , I like the place . " " Did you learn about the Amazons at college ? " P.S. smiled . " I learned something about them there . " " Where 'd you go ? " " Yale . " " I had a friend who went there , " she said . " In fact I almost went there myself . " " You mean the nursing school ? " " No , the college . " " But they do n't take women , " P.S. said . " I mean Harvard . " P.S. 's eye was caught by one of the modern paintings on the far wall . The painting was a bunch of bright orange streaks on a black background and it was signed " Faith . "
