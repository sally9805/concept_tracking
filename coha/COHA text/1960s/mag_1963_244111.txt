After a summer that most vacationers would rather forget ( see THE WORLD ) , Europe approached the serious business of fall with high hopes and busy schedules . September marks the end of the somnolent holiday season , the beginning of a new spurt of business and the return to work of the managers who make Europe 's industry run . In 1963 , it also marks a decisive time for the unique and historic union that is Europe 's Common Market . The remarkable fact about the Market , eight months after Charles de Gaulle abruptly barred Britain from membership , is that , in a triumph of economics over politics , it has continued to be a strong and growing force . <P> " This is a black day for Europe . The Common Market is now only a mechanism and no longer a living thing , " West German Economics Minister Ludwig Erhard had cried in his despair over De Gaulle 's action . The mechanism , nonetheless , is working very well . While 1963 has not been quite the year that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more successful than European businessmen dared to hope right after De Gaulle 's shocker . Among Europe 's top managers , there is a continuing confidence in economic growth , and a sense of expectation about where the Common Market is leading . <P> Psychologically In . The businessmen have continued to raise their production schedules . Despite the most disastrous winter in recorded European history , the Common Market is growing exuberantly at more than 4% for the second straight year . Says one top Ruhr industrialist : " Though the vetoing of Britain was a deep and painful psychological shock , it has had no direct effect on our business . " Nor has it affected Europe 's tariff-cutting schedule . European governments in July , without fuss or furore , cut tariffs among their countries another 10% , bringing the total tariff reduction to 60% since the Common Market began in 1958 . <P> Faced with thousands of individual decisions that had awaited Britain 's expected entry , both British and Continental businessmen took another look at the situation after De Gaulle 's veto , decided that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ignoring De Gaulle , the Common Market recently agreed to meet quarterly with British officials to exchange information , work out problems , and devise new ways to bring Britain closer to the Six . British exports to the Common Market were $280 million higher in the first half of 1963 than in 1961 's first half , and British investment houses are now included in almost every new Continental banking syndicate . " Psychologically , " says a director of a London bank , " Britain already is in the Common Market . " <P> <P> While waiting for Britain to enter in the years to come , the Common Market has expanded its influence in other directions . The Six recently signed a commercial treaty that will tie in their trade with that of 18 former African colonies . Having made Greece an associate member , the Six next month will give Turkey similar status . Among themselves , they have moved well along toward harmonizing their controversial and complicated business turnover taxes and centralizing their banking and budget policies . But the sharpest spur to increasing economic union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second only to the U.S. in size .
