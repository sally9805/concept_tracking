 | Most states provide that ex-felons , insane persons , and noncitizens can not vote in elections . This seems reasonable . But there is a huge group of people who are intelligent and sane , who have not been in prison , and who are citizens ? but who can not vote . They can not vote for a single reason : they are mobile . No one thinks this is particularly reasonable , but no one is doing much about it . Meanwhile , there are a vast and steadily growing number of Americans who are currently disenfranchised . Most states require that before you can vote , even for the President of the United States , you must have lived in your state , county , and voting district certain lengths of time . Usually the periods are one year in the state , 90 days in the county , and 30 days in the district , but they are much longer in some states . If you merely move across the street 30 days before an election , you can lose your right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this antiquated voting requirement is depriving a great many people of one of their most fundamental rights as citizens of the United States ? that is , their right to vote . Take the case of Jim Mainard as an example of how the system works . The name is changed , but the facts are true . Jim , thirty-five years old and a college graduate with an IQ of 132 , is regarded by his corporation as a promising executive . His wife is also a college graduate , and they have three children . Jim was recently transferred from New York to California as the result of a promotion , which also raised his salary to $9,600 a year . The company plans for Jim to spend two years in Los Angeles and then to move to San Francisco and there take over management of its West Coast headquarters . The Mainards were unable to vote for the governor and U.S. senator and congressman in California last year , and this year they will be unable to vote for the President of the United States ? to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propositions which could affect them very directly . The Mainards ? to put it quite bluntly ? have been disenfranchised . " We have been moving around so much , " Jim says , " that I have n't voted even once since I left college . To have been able to vote in New York , I would have had to have lived in the state one year , the county four months , .. and the district thirty days . I lived in the state one year all right , but I was on a training program which moved me from one branch of the company to another , each in a different county . Also , the company , like most large organizations , makes a point of moving you in the middle of the summer so that your children can start the school year without missing time . As a result , we always arrived in the new county in August . This never gave us time to qualify for the four  | months ' county residency before the November election rolled around . " Not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in many large cities the fall is " moving time . " As a result , there is a great flow from the city to the suburbs and from one district within the city to another . Many of these people . unless they have taken elaborate precautions . have found themselves unable to vote when the next election came . This August , when Jim Mainard is transferred to San Francisco , he will again have to meet a county residency requirement in time to vote this year . This is. you might say , an exceptional situation , one of the tiny , but unavoidable . cases that occur in a complex modern society . You would be wrong . Bureau @# of the Census ' Abstracts and Sociological Studies indicate that somewhere between five and ten million people move in the United States every year . Most of these " mobiles , " as they are called , will be unable to vote in the year they move . Indeed , it is quite possible that if these people were allowed to vote , many state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have noted , for example , that presidential elections are usually decided by very narrow margins . Even in the " landslide " choice of President Eisenhower in 1956 , if four percent of the voters had voted differently , Adlai Stevenson might be President today . It is not , however , the final result of the elections which causes sociologists and psychologists to be concerned . They  | are much more worried about the psychological damage to a citizen who is , time after time . denied the right to vote . Part of the American promise , a glowing part of our tradition driven home to us from childhood , is that each of us can share in the shaping of our political life by casting a ballot . But for utterly trivial reasons we now find - millions of citizens deprived of the right to vote . WHO are the people hurt by the invisible wall around the ballot box ? In general , they are precisely the people who act in the best American tradition : they have the gumption to pull up stakes and move to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jr. , author of The Organization Man , the study of the business executive , has proved that the person who moves most often is usually in the higher income brackets . The authors of They Went to College , Ernest Havemann and Patricia Salter West , have discovered that the higher the educational level of an individual , the more he will move about the country , seeking the best opportunities . There are a substantial number of mobiles who do not fit this description , of course . This group is made up of migratory workers ; workers in such seasonal jobs as lumber , construction , and dam-building ; drifters ; and a sizable number of what we used to call " hoboes . " In general , these people , psychologists tell us , have little political interest and little political information . They seldom wish to register . and they seldom vote . However , there is considerable evidence that if there were a simple , easily understood manner of registration , their political interest would be stimulated . It is altogether possible that they might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in any case , make the effort . There is a third group of Americans  | discriminated against by the present voting laws . This consists of the hundreds of thousands of loyal Americans who make their careers in the Army , Navy , Air Force , or Marine Corps or who spend several years in these branches of the armed forces as part of their military obligation . The accepted theory is that a serviceman and his family will keep up political ties in their home state . The simple fact is that many career people never serve in their home state , know little or nothing of its politics , and , at the same time , are denied the right to vote in the localities in which they live . A revision or elimination of the residency laws would allow these people to enter the political life of the communities in which they are stationed . RESIDENCY requirements grew out of the need to prevent rigged elections . Candidates used to organize their supporters like small armies , having them march from poll to poll and vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at each polling place . Some city machines began to " import " voters . For example , large numbers of voters were brought into Memphis from Arkansas , across the Mississippi River . These " visitors " voted and revoted in the city . In cities such as Philadelphia , it was not unusual to have 60.000 illegal votes cast in a single election . The only restraint on multiple and corrupt voting was the ability of the opposition to stop it . Voting , originally conceived as a right of every citizen , was becoming a right which was sometimes exercised in an atmosphere of guerrilla , rowdy , alcoholic warfare . By 1890 , most states were moving to correct these flagrant outrages through a registration procedure calling for a residency requirement . which stated that a voter had to have lived in the state , county . and district a set time . The residency requirement made sense for two reasons . First , it allowed the voting officials to verify the voters by checking their names against their addresses . Second , it was reasonable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn the issues and personalities involved in state and local politics . Today , however , the conditions which made fraudulent voting possible have almost completely disappeared . The bigcity boss , for example , no longer has great masses of newly arrived , politically ignorant immigrants to deploy and have vote as he sees fit . Voting officials have also developed sound techniques , along with a corps of people who understand them well . Today both the voting officials and the representatives of political parties watch elections like hawks , ready to pounce at the faintest sign of any irregularity . There are available any number of sensible procedures which would make it possible for newcomers to vote and which would still eliminate fraudulent voting . One ingenious possibility , among many . would take advantage of the skill and rapidity with which modern electronic machinery can handle cards and information . With this system each newcomer would merely identify himself properly when he entered a new state . He would then be issued a voting license . which would indicate the district and county in which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kept in the state capital , along with separate cards for all other voters . At voting time the voter would receive a keyed card , which would tell him where to vote . A duplicate of the card would go to the designated polling place . When the voter moved out of the district or county . he would merely drop his " license " in the mail , indicating his new address . and the machines would automatically assign him to a new precinct . Such a procedure not only would be workable and avoid the ponderous registration procedures now effective in most states , but would , in all probability , be cheaper than the present system . Today , moreover , it is no longer necessary for a person to have lived a year in a state before he understands its politics . In recent years we have developed our means of communication and education in enormous strides . If a person has been in a state a short time , he has had access to enough information on which to base a political decision ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities of such nonpartisan organizations as the League of Women Voters . Also , all candidates and parties go to elaborate pains to put their programs before the voters . THERE is every indication that American mobility will increase , rather than decrease , in the future . Air travel is getting even quicker and less expensive . Railways have developed family plans that make it easier to move crosscountry . The unrolling of the freeways across America is a constant invitation to the venturesome to strike out for new frontiers . Whole communities of trailers now dot the nation . Around the cities are thick belts of suburban homes which are built , financed , and designed for a rapid turnover in occupancy . It has become almost effortless for a family to wind up its affairs , move a thousand miles , and set up a new home . The rotation and training plans of big corporations and government agencies , the natural impulse of Americans to move on , the increased ease of moving ? all assure sociologists that an increasing number of our population will become mobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights of this growing number of mobile citizens is made more urgent by the fact that this year we will again vote for a President . If the voting laws remain unchanged . at least five million intelligent voters will be denied the privilege of casting their ballots . This is not a party issue . The denied vote cuts across party lines . It is a national issue . and it is time something was done about it on a nationwide basis .
