WHAT began as a bizarre incident on the high seas last January came to an end last week after an equally bizarre series of diplomatic maneuvers . Held captive in North Korea for eleven months , the crew members of the surveillance ship U.S.S. Pueblo were released and flown home to the U.S. The episode will not end there . The crewmen , some of whom said they had been beaten and tortured by their captors , now face a formal court of inquiry that will raise some serious questions . Did the Pueblo at any time stray into North Korean waters ? Should the ship have been surrendered without a fight ? Why did the men sign " confessions " that they had spied ? <P> It was a chilly , hazy morning last week when the men walked one by one through light snow that dusted the 250-ft . Bridge of No Return from North to South Korea . In quilted blue coats , grey shirts , flannel trousers and white-soled black sneakers , the 82 surviving crew members filed over the bridge at ten-foot intervals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mortally wounded during the hijacking by North Korean patrol boats , was brought to mid-bridge in a North Korean ambulance and his coffin transferred to a waiting U.S. truck . <P> Led by Pueblo 's skipper , Commander Lloyd Bucher , who looked a decade older than his 41 years , they were bundled into three olive-drab U.S Army buses and driven to the United Nations Command 's advance camp in the Korean demilitarized zone . They were fed and given field jackets and toilet kits . Eventually pronounced fit to travel to the U.S. , they boarded two giant C-141 <P> StarLifter transports near Seoul for the long flight to San Diego , where the Navy had assembled their families from all over the U.S. One day before Christmas , the big jets landed at Miramar Naval Air Station , taxiing up to nestle their big black noses against ropes holding back the crewmen 's families . The men disembarked , Bucher in the lead . " It 's so great . You 'll never know how great it is , " he called out as he limped toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , tears running down his cheeks . When Hodges ' coffin was removed from the lead plane , the happy families abruptly fell silent while a band played the Navy Hymn . <P> Yes and No . The prisoners ' long-sought release came only hours after the enactment of a scene that belongs in the weirder annals of diplomacy . In the one-story hut in Panmunjom that has seen hundreds of meetings since the 1953 truce that ended the Korean War , U.S. Army Major General Gilbert H. Woodward sat down opposite North Korean Major General Pak Chung Kuk . " The position of the U.S. , " said General Woodward , the top U.N . member of the armistice commission , " has been that the ship was not engaged in illegal activities , that there is no convincing evidence that the ship at any time intruded into territorial waters claimed by North Korea , and that we could not apologize for actions we did not believe took place . " He added : " My signature will not and can not alter the facts . I will sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crew . "
