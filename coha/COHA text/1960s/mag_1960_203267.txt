No sooner did the full-page ad for Allen Drury 's bestseller Advise and Consent appear in the New York Times last week than telephones started ringing at Publisher Doubleday &; Co. and its ad agency , Franklin Spier . How in the world had Doubleday lined up those models ? There was Vice President Richard Nixon standing beside an airliner chatting animatedly with Democratic Presidential Candidate John Kennedy . The apparent object of conversation : Advise and Consent , gripped firmly in Nixon 's hand . <P> The answer was simple enough . Both men had been traveling west from Washington last June 19 on a United Air Lines DC-7 , were met by reporters during a layover in Chicago . The airline photographer assigned to celebrity duty asked the two men to pose , and handed Nixon the advance copy of Advise and Consent that Kennedy had been reading on the flight . United ran the picture in the October issue of the company 's Mainliner magazine , sent a copy to Newsman Drury , who passed it on to Doubleday . The publishers tried a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a $4,560 full-page ad in the Times . The effect was as expected . At stores around Manhattan , Advise and Consent sales showed a satisfying jump .
