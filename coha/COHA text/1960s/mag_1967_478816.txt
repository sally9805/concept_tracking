Sigmund Freud was in his middle thirties , his medical career began to take an alarming turn . This was in the early 1890s , years before his thinking attained that conceptual shape we call psychoanalysis . A gifted neuropsychiatrist of increasing reputation , Freud was becoming alienated from the professional community of Vienna . The personal advantages his brilliance had already achieved were beginning to slip away , at first into indifference , then derision . For a man approaching middle age and shouldering responsibility not only for his wife and children , but for his parents and sisters as well , the financial jeopardy was nerve-racking . That his professional plight was not the result of something suddenly bizarre or iconoclastic in his assertions about mental illness compounded his frustrations . Iconoclastic opinions were to damage his career much later , and when they did , he readily accepted it . At this point , his was a case of exasperating an establishment not yet prepared for reformation . For example , Freud 's early proposals about the sexual factor in the psychoneuroses were not sensational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A relationship between the sexual life of patients and their nervous disorders was a suspicion widespread among medical practitioners of the time . Freud credited Ghareot , one of his most esteemed teachers , with the remark referring to mental patients , " Ma is , dais des cas pareils c'est toujours le chose genitate , toujours , toujours , toujours " ? with such patients , it is always a matter of sex , always , always , always . It was Josef Breuer , physician to many luminaries of Viennese society , who said to Freud about a neurotic patient , " These things are always secrets d'a/cOve " ? questions involving the marriage bed . Another indelible reference to sex came from Professor Rudolf Chrobak , the most eminent gynecologist of Vienna . In connection with a woman hesent to Freud for treatment , he recommended with cynical despair : " Rx . Penis nor ? talis dosing repetatur " ? the best medicine would be an ordinary penis , repeatedly . Thus when Freud initially codified these ideas into a scientific position , it was not his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something about Freud 's character . As he commented years later , those notions that his colleagues casually flirted with , be married ? and took the consequences . Indeed , genius without character is hopeless ; for it is character that dares to carry ideas beyond the judgment of a given time and place , into the more risky tribunals of Destiny . Naturally Freud 's character ? his almost na ? ve earnestness ? found expression in his daily clinical practice , in his actual conduct with patients . In his therapeutic activities , which flash with character , there are awesome glimpses of his great purpose that have remained comparatively neglected in the dissemination of his thought . Vienna abounded in so-called classically hysterical women , patients free of physical lesions but nevertheless given to fainting spells , shortness of breath , ill-temper , depression , amnesia , nausea , delusions , migraines , paralyses ? the list could be extended to a full page . The male neurotics tended toward elaborate and incapacitating obsessions and compulsions . Theories about the psychoneuroses were far in advance of therapeutic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cancer . To the Vienna medical society ( which was one of the best in the world ) , hobbled as it was by an ignorance as to how to treat the psychoneuroses , neurotic patients were regarded as annoyances , malingerers , pests . Treatment consisted of talking , suggesting , and commanding the neurotic out of his symptoms . This failing , mild electric shock , rest cures , warm baths , and other techniques were called in , largely to emphasize the 100 FREUD AND HIS OWN PATIENTS doctor 's determination that the patient get well . The doctor-patient relationship could be described as one of mutual harassment , I have mentioned that Freud took quite seriously the business of sexuality . Another idea ? somewhat less common , because it was more complex , was that neurosis had something to do with the lengths a patient had to go to avoid unsavory thoughts and memories of painful events . This Freud also took seriously , and he pronounced the idea in an italicized maxim in one of his earliest papers : " Hysterical patients suffer principally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consequences of this idea were extraordinary . It meant that the doctor should listen to his patient 's verbal reports and try to locate the morbid feeling and ideas his neurotic symptoms replace . With typical plausibility , this is precisely what Freud did , for hours on end , day after day . But he not only listened to the nonsense of his patients ; he began to demand that they amplify details that were obscure and incomplete . Inevitably , Freud was becoming , as David Riesman once called him , a " rate buster . " Where all around him superficial dispatch prevailed , Freud found it necessary to prolong therapy to unheard-of lengths . Like Philoctetes , Freud now possessed a wound and a bow , for which he was both shunned and sought . In practicing psychiatry , this means that you become one of the list of " extreme measures , " and you are referred the most intractable cases . These days you would have to ransack your directory for a colleague who would take on the kind of case that routinely filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet in all his published accounts of treatment , there is not a breath of self-pity or self-aggrandizement . Reason vs . Obsession Wat was it like to be a patient of such a doctor ? It has been said that Freud was a severe rationalist who reduced human vitalities to barren mechanics . But this is true only if pettiness is proof of passion . When a patient consulted Freud , he was in the presence of a man deeply involved in an enterprise larger than the patient and larger than Freud . It was the absence of personal pettiness in the situation he created that liberated the patient 's secrets . There was nothing a patient could tell this man that he could n't find a proper niche for in the human design . He could walk through nightmares and humanize all demons . He was the passionate enemy of every fear that made freedom of thought less than an absolute principle . Though he staked everything on the power of reason , the scheme that reason served could have occurred only to a man of transcendental sensibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ histories that appear now and again in the long shelf of Freud 's writings . The Rat Man case ? we shall learn momentarily the reason for this grisly appellation ? comes to mind first , because I ca n't imagine another psychiatrist in practice at that time who , upon hearing the complaints of the Rat Man , would not have come forth promptly with the well-meaning voice of conventional reassurance and thereby blown the case , The Rat Man ( this is his nickname among analysts ; - Notes Upon a Case of Obsessional Neurosis " is his original name ) was a young law student who had recently done military training , and consulted Freud in connection with proliferating obsessions . Their grip upon him could be regulated only by the patient 's performing nonsensical acts , which were consuming years of his life . Typical was an irresistible urge to interrupt his studying at a given hour in the evening and retire to a downstairs vestibule where he had to expose his genitals in a mirror while thinking about his deceased father . Many of his compulsions were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restraint , as when , for example , it occurred to the patient that to remove a jinx from a particular person he was fond of , he would have to slit his own throat with a razor . Other compulsions existed as far back as the patient could remember , and previous therapy had failed to ameliorate his suffering . What drove the Rat Man into further treatment at the moment was an especially maddening incident involving a fellow army officer . He sought Freud in particular , having chanced upon Freud 's just-published The Psychopathology of Everyday Lif e . In the pages of that book he thought he recognized himself . This was shortly after the turn of the century , when Freud was wholly in disrepute , so that a patient 's coming to Freud was a good indication of desperation . A large part of the notes of the case is given over to the multitudinous details of the army incident that brought the patient to treatment . What Donald M. Kaplan , Ph.D. , is an associate editor of the " American Imago , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " where he has been publishing a series of articles on psychoanalysis and theater . He is on the faculties of the Washington Square Institute for Psychotherapy and Mental Health , and the Institute of the New York Society of Freudian Psychologists , was immediately helpful was Freud 's unreserved interest in these details . Roughly , the patient had gotten it into his head that he owed a particular army officer a trifling sum of money for the delivery to the patient of a small package . However , the fact was that the patient owed the money to the postal clerk who had received the package and had advanced the COD charges . Though the patient was fully aware of this fact , he could not shake himself free of the compulsion to pay the money to the army officer instead . The package , incidentally , contained eyeglasses , a replacement for a pair the patient had lost on maneuvers . Knowing that the officer would think him crazy for insisting upon paying a debt that was not actually owed , the patient concocted devious plots to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this were not bad enough , these plots had to accommodate all sorts of ridiculous compulsive conditions . One , for example , was that the money had to be paid through a go-between , another officer . I shall forgo a recounting of the patient 's final turmoil , which reached its climax on a train speeding back to town . The prospect of even suggesting the patient 's agitated ruminations about switching train connections so that he could finally execute his compulsion sets my teeth on edge . Freud marked every detail without contention . But very soon the patient 's recital to Freud struck an obstacle . Before the patient could pro , teed with the further details of his obsessional debt , he had to bring into his story still another officer . This was the person who had wrongly told the patient which officer had laid out the money for the package . The patient knew the money was really owed to the postal clerk . Why , then , was this person 's misinformation so compelling ? The patient 's attempt to dodge this matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( but notice the gentility with which Freud exorcised a malignant thought ) . On maneuvers , just before losing his eyeglasses , the patient had gotten into conversation with the officer now in question . This officer , the patient told Freud , began to describe a horrible torture used in the East . . . Here the patient broke off . He got up from the analytic sofa , unable to continue , and implored the doctor to spare him the report of the details . Freud assured him that the treatment was not designed to torment the patient , The patient roamed about the room . pleading . But the doctor could not grant something which was beyond his power . ( The power was now in the idea and no longer in the man who had invented the idea . ) " He might just as well ask me to give him the moon , " Freud wrote . " I went on to say that Iby Donald M. Kaplan 103 would do all I could , nevertheless , to guess the full meaning of any hints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No , not that ? " the patient hesitated ? " the criminal was tied up ? a pot was turned upside-down on his buttocks ? some rats were put into it ? and they ? bored their way in ? " Into his anus , Freud completed the sentence . Whereupon a dam of reserve cracked , and a flood of rat fantasies poured forth , so upsetting that by the end of the session , the patient was calling Freud " Captain . " For months thereafter they sifted the patient 's thoughts to try to find out how the idea of rats had acquired its overwhelming effect . They discovered , for example , a forgotten story of the patient 's father who had been , during his own army service , a spielratte ? a gambler ? and had lust at cards small sums of money entrusted to him in his duties as a kind of quartermaster . The story mortified the patient , who held his father in impeccable esteem . And they happened upon a memory so vague the patient had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This memory had to do with his father 's physical violence after the patient had like a rat ) bitten someone as a very young child . The patient could n't reconcile the idea of this beating with the image of his father 's gentility , until a point in treatment when the patient found himself moved to rebuke Freud bitterly but unaccountably , for he had grown immensely fond of Freud . What enforced the conviction about the memory was the fact that these verbal attacks on Freud could not be made from the analytic couch . The patient had to leap up and shout his abuse from across the room , thus avoiding the retaliatory thrashing he expected from Freud . Where else but from the example of his otherwise benevolent father could the patient have learned to defend himself against the absurd idea of Freud 's punching him in the face ? Piece by piece , the rat symbol was dismantled , and what conspired in its symptoms , conspired in other symptoms , which fell away under these auspices . There is a final footnote , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the case : " The patient 's mental health was restored to him by the analysis which I have reported upon in these pages . Like so many other young men of value and promise , he perished in the Great War . " The Lady in the Alps When he treated the Rat Man , Freud was already a mature and seasoned psychoanalytic therapist ? the only one in the world . The case of 104 FREUD AND HIS OWN PATIENTS Katherina affords a glimpse of Freud when his intellectual and clinical enthusiasm estranged him professionally from his colleagues . The events took place around 1892 . We know about Katharine from an afternoon 's consultation with Freud in a rather surprising setting . It was summer . Freud was on vacation in the Eastern Alps and one day happened into a mountaintop hotel to rest after a strenuous climb . Katherina was the young daughter of the landlady , When she learned from the visitor 's book that Freud was a doctor , she approached him and asked for his help . She had " bad nerves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young lady , culturally rural , and that she spoke in a regional dialect . Her politeness and despondency overcame his reluctance to have his holiday intruded upon . Her complaint , as she described it , was of a sort common in Freud 's clinical experience . During the past two years , Katherina had suffered periodically from a syndrome of pressure on the chest with suffocating shortness of breath , nausea , and terror at the apparition of an anguished , unrecognizable face , a man 's face . She would faint and have to be put to bed for several days . Anxiety hysteria , Freud mentally remarked , was obviously not limited to cosmopolitan society . Two theories informed Freud 's questioning of Katharine as she sat across from him at a secluded restaurant table . One theory involved the sexual factor , the other , the traumatic event itself . His technique at this time was ? to be charitable ? naive : Ile told her he knew how her attacks had come on two years ago . She had seen something embarrassing that she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a perfect hit . Immediately , Katharine recalled that her first attack occurred two years ago , shortly after she happened to see her father in bed with one of the maidservants . She caught the scene through the window of a ground-floor bedroom , but it was too dark to make out exactly what they were doing or whether they were clothed or not . Katherina lost her breath , reeled against the wall and several days later went to bed with her first full-blown hysterical attack . A mind less ardent than Freud 's might have stopped here , with this gratifying confirmation of his sense of things . But Katherina 's reaction really confirmed very little . Why exactly the pressure on her chest ? Why not some other symptom ? And whose face appeared in the apparitions ? Her father 's ? But , then , why was it anguished , when the scene involved the father in an act of pleasure ? Not least , why did the scene have the effect it did ? Such reactions as Katharine 's are not inevitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though Katherina was getting caught up in the spirit of the inquiry . At the height of their frustrations , Freud made a grand appeal to a fresh agency ? the mind 's own lawfulness . " I told her to go on and tell me whatever occurred to her , in the confident expectation that she would think of precisely what I needed to explain the case . " At first Katherina rambled on about her present circumstances but soon gravitated toward several earlier incidents . They were not very remote in time , and they had to do with her father 's unsuccessful sexual advances toward her . The first proved very much to the point . It contains every element of her syndrome : Katherina was fourteen when she went on a particular overnight trip with her father . They shared the same room but slept , of course , in different . beds . In the middle of night , Katherina awoke suddenly , shocked to find her father in bed with her , his bOdy pressing against her . She rushed to the doorway , nauseous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she remonstrated . " Go on , you silly girl , keep still . You do n't know how nice it is . " Katharine threatened to take refuge in the hallway , at which her father soured his face and returned to bed . Katharine also returned to bed and slept the night through unmolested . As for the sight of her father in bed with the maidservant , Freud was able to show her that her reaction was not so much to that but to the memories that the sight stirred up in her . The more recent scene , in short , was charged with her memories . " She was like someone transformed , " Freud observed . " The sulky , unhappy face had grown lively , her eyes were bright , she was lightened and exalted . " Freud left his card in the event that she needed more help . Evidently she never felt the need , for he never saw her again . 1 might add that his incident of a single consultation was not an isolated one . Throughout much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consultations . Quite often he gave very significant help in a single hour , without recommending a long course of formal psychoanalysis , which spells the lie to the myth that Freud believed everyone ought to undergo analysis . Indeed , from various accounts we know that Freud treated the conductor Bruno Walter in a single consultation , when Walter became panicky about not being able to conduct with an almost paralyzed arm . Walter recounts in his autobiography how Freud examined his arm and concluded hysteria . " But I ca n't move my arm , " Walter objected . " Try it at any rate , " Freud urged . " And what if I should have to stop conducting ? " " You wo n't have to stop . " " Can I take upon myself the responsibility of possibly upsetting a performance ? " Freud puffed his cigar . " I 'll take the responsibility . " Walter conducted beautifully . Of course , Freud never suggested that such encounters substituted for psychoanalysis . Theodor Reik has a letter from Freud concerning Reik 's inquiry about Freud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently benefited immensely , but , as Freud put it in the letter : " It was as if you would dig a single shaft through a mysterious building . " A Failure with Dora Did Freud ever mishandle the clinical situation ? He was sufficiently secure in the knowledge of his powers to confess his limitations , but even these are full of instruction . The case of Dora has been a subject of lively dispute . Anticipating future criticism , Freud did attempt to acquit himself in regard to the outcome of the case . But he had obvious doubts . The story is this : Dura was a mature eighteen-year-old young lady , bright and vivacious . An hysteric with migraines , nervous coughing , fainting spells , irritability , she had run through a succession of doctors in a short span of years . Finally she planted a histrionic suicide note on her family that drove them to their wits ' end , and they dragged her off to Freud " to talk some sense into her . " Her emotional blackmailing and tyranny were evident to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at these things in the course of her long life . She nagged her husband literally to death . Her attending physician at her own deathbed in New York some dozen years ago referred to her as one of the most repulsive individuals he had ever come across . ) However , the Story she related to Freud was very poignant . For years , she told Freud , her father had been carrying on an affair with a close friend of the family . Dora 's mother , incidentally , was a hausfrau whose clays were spent covering and uncovering the furniture in a constant battle against dirt . Her father made no bones about his infidelity . But much worae , when Dora developed into a lovely adolescent of fourteen , her fatherby Donald M. Kaplan 105 began to encourage an affair between Dora and his mistress 's husband in the hope of buying off the husband 's interference . The husband ? T have always thought him a rather decent , though pathetic , fellow ? read the father 's encouragements gladly and began to ply Dora with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the husband could contain himself no longer ; how much Dura most have provoked this was beyond her awareness . He trapped Dora in a hallway and mauled her passionately . She threw him aside and tied . Shortly thereafter she had her first hysterical attack . And so began her series of high-strung bouts with Viennese psychiatry . Dora told Freud these things with outraged righteousness and demanded Freud 's cooperation in her wish for vengeance . Freud believed the facts of Dora 's story . But many hold that he made his first mistake in attempting to analyze her straight off , a doomed undertaking with a patient thoroughly consumed by the merits of her immediate crisis , as Dora was . While she wanted Freud to agree that her symptoms were the appropriate reactions to her father 's infamous conduct , Freud wanted her to see how she participated , unwittingly but nevertheless actively , in her own victimization . It was as though Freud took his vehicle for a bulldozer . With Dora , he was driving it right into a mountain . The " analysis " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finest ingenuity in proving to Dora how her symptoms were her self-punitive moral judgments on her own unconscious envy of her father 's mistress and on her actual erotic desires for the man who finally forced himself upon her in the hallway . As with her would-be lover , Dora 's cooperation with Freud was a setup . She produced astonishing confirmations in her dreams and mental associations , which aroused Freud 's therapeutic hopes and theoretical interests . At the peak of his involvement , and at what he deemed the brink of her cure , Dora cut him down . This was the cunning moment her vindictiveness chose for the cool opening remark of what was to be her last session . " Do you know that I am here for the last time today ? " Freud recovered in a wink , When had she come to this resolve , was all he asked , She had made up her mind two weeks ago ? which drew her thoughts , with Freud 's continued collaboration , to a particular incident involving the dismissal of a governess . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks ' notice . I have suggested one possibility of error , that Dora was simply in no condition to be analyzed . She may have needed perhaps years of weaning 106 FREUD AND HIS OWN PATIENTS from her narcissism in preparation for analysis . Another possibility of error was Freud 's neglect of the " transference . " Dora had succeeded in repeating in the analytic situation what she had done with her aroused pursuer in the hallway . Freud should have known that she was bound to do this and should have taken interpretive steps to prevent it before it got out of hand . Was he too involved at . the time in his personal scientific curiosities ? Or was he just no good with petulant women ? Erik H. Erikson , among others , has argued that Dora , who was merely eighteen at the time of treatment , was entitled to Freud 's support and commiseration , that a sense of fidelity is as much an unconditional right of the adolescent as food is of the infant . Was Freud 's analytic neutrality too harsh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Might I perhaps have kept the girl under my treatment if 1 myself had acted a part ? If I had exaggerated the importance to me of her staying on , and had shown a warm personal interest in her . . . ? I do not know . . . In spite of every theoretical interest and every endeavor to be of assistance as a physician , I keep the fact in mind that there must be some limits set to the extent to which psychological influence may he used , and 1 respect as one of these limits the patient 's own will and understanding . " What a discrepancy between this ethic and the hucksterism of some activities of today 's psychiatric movement , where the public can find just about anything it wants , so long as the fee can be met . Dora did return to Freud fifteen months later , " to finish her story and ask for help once more . " Goodness knows , Freud needed the fee . " But one glance at her face was enough to tell me that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked , She spoke of her gains and setbacks . At the end of her hour Freud sent her on her way . Should he have taken her back ? It has been reported that in Dora 's subsequent life , first in Paris , then in America , she never missed a chance to aver , with bashful pride , that she was the Dora of Freud 's famous " Fragment of an Analysis of a Case of Hysteria . " Her three months with Freud may have been the only experience with unimpeachable integrity in her long , unhappy life . Money . The prosperous psychoanalyst is a nepotist . But . Freud constantly found it hard to make ends meet . At first there was his falling out of favor , his " splendid isolation , " as he called it . Afterwards he was still too busy with the theory and practice of psychoanalysis to make any real money out of his international reputation . In 1924 McCormick 's Chicago Tribune offered Freud anopen price ? any amount ? to cover the Leopold-Loeb trial in Chicago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar offer from the Hearst empire , which included a chartered ocean liner all to himself . When Freud 's nephew Edward L. Bernays eagerly wrote to him from New York about the possibility of a $5,000 advance and vast sales for a brief autobiography , Freud was appalled , though not without good humor , at the very idea of getting " a hitherto decent man to commit such an outrageous act for $5,000 . " He added : " Temptation would begin for me at a sum a hundred times as great and even then the offer would be rejected after half an hour . " In renouncing such opportunities , Freud often cited his health , which was very bad during the latter span of his life . But this was never the crucial reason because , despite his physical discomfort ? he had cancer ? and the wear and tear of advancing years , his output was unflagging . The truth was that he did n't have forever to insure the future of psychoanalysis , and he knew that this would be best accomplished by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor . For example , he did write a brief autobiography not lung after his nephew 's overture , but he wrote it for a technical rather than commercial publisher , and received a pittance for it . His own Psychoanalytic Presa , whose original editions are now treasures , continued to take every spare dollar . He was once upset for months over a consultation with a renowned oral surgeon who was passing through Vienna , because the fee he paid the man had been earmarked for the Press . Thus Freud lived mainly from his daily labor with patients . He averaged between seven and ten cases a day , each patient attending six sessions a week . Later the number of sessions was established at five a week to make time for an extra student Freud had inadvertently permitted to come to Vienna , when his schedule was actually full . At the height of his fame in the 1920s , Freud 's fees were $20 per session for regular patients and $10 for students undergoing training analyses ; in New York , his former students were already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , but there were always too many students in his practice for this to make much difference financially . He was forever mortgaging his present for the future . By and large , these students went on to redeem his great sacrifice . A handful survive . In their sixties and seventies , their contributions are worthy of an army of workers . The mystique that shrouds the analytic fee is not Freud 's legacy . Nowhere did he claim that the 107 analytic cure depended upon a painful financial sacrifice by the patient . Freud counseled a straightforward attitude about money , as he did about sex . The fee is the analyst 's livelihood . It benefits the analyst , not the patient . Sn long as the analyst receives his wages from some source , there is no evidence that free treatment is less effective than costly treatment . Karl Menninger has underscored this simplicity He has written that the best source of money for analysis is a dormant savings account . What would Freud do with those who came with little means , with those whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out by Europe 's periodic depressions and political upheavals ? His students tell how he was always pestering them to find time for indigent patients . They would have turned down the request of a do-gooder , a sentimental charity-monger . But Freud 's character instilled in the merest project a sense of great enterprise . Indeed , at this writing there is an aged man in Vienna , the only direct representative of Freud in the city that was the birthplace and one-time capital of psychoanalysis , for psychoanalysis perished there with the Nazi occupation . A former patient of Freud 's , this man is called the Wolfman because his treatment centered on the analysis of a dream of a tree full of white wolves . The treatment became Freud 's masterpiece in clinical exposition , and the Wolfman sometimes grants appointments to analytic students who continue to research his case . The Wolfman earns his bare living as a writer of sorts . The point is that he was Russian nobility when he came to Freud . Incapacitated , he settled with his entourage in Vienna to undergo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Professor . " After several years , the Bolshevik revolution destroyed his holdings . Overnight he became a destitute refugee . Freud carried him for years thereafter with no hopes of financial repayment . When the Wolf-man later required further treatment , Freud thought it better for his case to continue with a woman analyst . He prevailed upon and secured a gifted British analyst for his patient , who was still living from hand to mouth . Until he no longer needed it , the Wolfman continued to receive the very best treatment . It is no insult either to myself or to my colleagues to observe that our attempts at such gestures , which to Freud had all the grace of lifelong manners , invariably come to grief in anxiety and resentment . The gap between Freud 's practices and ours is not cited in order to humiliate , but to reveal the challenges we have still to meet , challenges generated not by his genius so much as by his vision and character . That we have gone beyond Freud is a figment , unless the windy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eagerness to surpass easy solutions to tragic problems . Nor is the adventurism prevalent today what he really meant by versatility in psychotherapy . Beyond Freud ? On the contrary . Benjamin Nelson has put it exactly : " Too few years are left in the present century to exhaust the dimensions of his message or to approximate the substance of his hopes . " And that tiresome clich ? : " Freud was a brilliant theoretician , but not a very good doctor ! ' Nut a very good doctor ? Compared to whom ?
