The biggest bottleneck in the U.S. missile program is not the development or testing of the giant birds-which have been firing successfully-but construction of the bases that would be needed to send them winging against an enemy . The U.S. now has six operational Atlas intercontinental ballistic missiles-and by schedule should now have 18 . Later this year twelve Atlases will be operational , whereas there should be more than 30 . Last week 56 top executives of companies that make the Atlas and its launching sites returned home from Washington after a rousing pep talk from Defense Secretary Thomas S. Gates Jr . urging them to get the Atlas back on schedule . The chief problem , conceded Air Force Brigadier General William E. Leonhard , a deputy commander of the Ballistic Missile Division , is " the difficulties of doing a wartime task under peacetime conditions and authority . " <P> Like Building Dams ? The Atlas ' woes show that it takes more than a big budget and brainy scientists to win the missile race . One of the chief difficulties has been the lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after approving the plans of the prime contractor , turns the job of letting construction contracts over to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers . The Air Force and the Army engineers each blame the other for the delays . The Army charges that the Air Force makes impossible demands , frequently changes its mind ; the Air Force replies that the Army engineers are trying to build bases as they build dams . <P> Both the Army and the Air Force give the contractors poor marks . The Convair division of General Dynamics Corp. , one of the prime contractors for the Atlas , has come under criticism for placing so much stress on test shots at Cape Canaveral that it has not put enough effort into preparing missile bases . Construction contractors selected by the Corps of Engineers often farmed the work to subcontractors who underestimated the task , sometimes buckled under the pressure . At Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha , where Atlas launching sites are three months behind schedule , New York 's Malan-Grove Construction Co. gave 90% of the work to 46 subcontractors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being operated by bonding companies . At the Offutt launching sites , nine concrete pedestals intended for support of liquid-oxygen lines had to be replaced because they had inadequate supporting steel . Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne , Wyo. , scheduled to be the first operational tactical missile base by last spring , will not be ready until fall , largely because contractors could not fulfill their commitments . <P> No Ready Mix . For their part , the contractors complain bitterly that they are often not paid on time for their work , are burdened by the complexity of the new sites ( some 4,000 miles of wire and 25,000 connections ) and by whole chains of changes that are set off when something new is discovered during a missile firing . The changes are necessary if the U.S. is to keep its bases as sophisticated as its developing missiles , but they can play hob with schedules . At Offutt base , more than 50 site changes have been ordered , ranging from " a few dollars to more than a million dollars . " The Warren base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to cost $100 million because of numerous modifications .
