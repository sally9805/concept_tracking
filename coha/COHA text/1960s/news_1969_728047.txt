txt The National Governors Conference , ignoring regional differences for the promise of financial relief , voted today to urge a Federal take-over of all welfare costs and a national compulsory health insurance program . With only minor opposition , the nation 's Governors accepted the program presented by Governor Rockefeller , chairman of the Human Resources Committee of the conference . Obviously buoyed by the support these proposals received and the general mood of agreement here , Governor Rockefeller moved immediately to gain informal backing for his proposals for Federal tax sharing .. Wider Role Foreseen They would draw back to the states in the next seven years $30-billion to $40-billion more of the Federal tax revenues than President Nixon had advocated in his announced revenue sharing program . " The Governors , " Mr. Rockefeller said later , " have moved ahead of the Washington scene in their perception of the needs and the problems we face as a nation . It seems to me we have done more to grapple with national issues and take positions than any conference I have ever attended . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will " assume a more important role in the formulation of national policies " than in recent years . In a related expression of concern over Federal aid , the Governors urged a trust fund approach to development of mass transit systems , much as is now used to fund the interstate highway system . The // unanimous vote came despite an appearance by John A. Volpe , Secretary of Transportation , who said he was convinced the Administration policy of seeking Congressional contract approval for a fiveyear period would work as well . Mr. Volpe had been an advocate inside the Administration for a trust fund approach on the ground that it would be less subject to the whims of Congressional appropriation procedures . The significance of the votes here on welfare and health insurance is directly related to the financial burden that ' would be lifted from state governments if the Federal Govern- , ment followed through on the Governors ' proposals . The Governors have in effect given Washington a clear signal that wide support exists among state officials ? and presumably the political forces they represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs . The welfare concept in the Rockefeller program was immediately endorsed by Senator Fred R. Harris , Democrat of Oklahoma , who was here at the request of the Democratic Governors . Senator Harris said he was preparing to introduce legislation to carry out the plan . Opposition is expected from the Nixon Administration , however . Arthur F. Burns , counselor to the President , said here yesterday that he was " confident " the Administration would oppose such a move . A system of compulsory health insurance may receive more favorable attention from the Administration . Staff members to the President are reviewing current health programs , looking for alternatives . In their policy statement on welfare , the Governors urge that within five years the Federal Government take over the cost of the entire program . President Nixon 's proposals would result in national welfare standards that would do essentially that for 20 states paying the minimum welfare benefits . Should Apply to All The Governors are saying , thus , that what applies to 20 states should apply to all and that the Federal Government should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the payment of welfare benefits . Welfare discussions among Governors have traditionally pitted Southerners against others in arguments about the need for such programs . But the Rockefeller proposal had the full and vocal support of Gov . John of Louisiana , a Democrat . Governor , in fact , defended the proposals against . attacks by Gov . Lester G. Maddox of Georgia , who is also a Democrat . " This is all part of a move to have the states abdicate all their responsibilities to the Federal Government , " Governor Maddox complained . " It 's a very bad move . " " I would hate , " Governor retorted , " to have the people here get the impression from some remarks that the Southern Governors are opposed to welfare . " The Governor then noted that his state , Louisiana , had begun paying welfare benefits before the Federal Government did . ' A Lonely Position ' Governor Rockefeller pointed out that Georgia was one of the 20 states that would have its total welfare costs assumed under the Nixon proposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your interest in local effort , you are saying that you would continue to put local money in to increase benefits to a level that some states now pay . " " Mine is a lonely position , " Governor Maddox said as he recorded the only " no " vote on the proposal . The compulsory health insurance proposal was opposed strongly by Gov . Stanley K. Hathaway of Wyoming , a Republican , and Gov . Ronald Reagan of California , also a Republican . Both argued for an amendment , submitted b. ? , Governor Hathaway in be/Calf of the American Medical Association , that would have made the proposed system voluntary . Under the policy statement , which was adopted with only a handful of dissenting votes , the Governors ask the Federal Government to set up a system requiring that health insurance be bought from private companies by payroll deductions contributed to by employers and employes . The present Medicaid system would be retained only for cases of catastrophic illness . The Federal welfare system would purchase such insurance for the poor . Would Shift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs to the workers , their employers and the Medicaid and welfare systems , requiring no state contributions . Governor Rockefeller then moved to generate support among the Governors for a Federal-state tax sharing plan that would greatly increase Federal revenues returned to the states . The growth of existing taxes , he said , will generate $125-billion in new revenues by 1976 . This growth of present tax revenues could permit the Federal Government ? by returning 35 per cent of this " growth dividend " to the states  --  to offer Federal aid in the amount of 1$43.8-billion in 1976 . President Nixon , in his revenue sharing program , has set $12-billion as a target sum to be returned to the states and local governments by 1976 . " The President has said that to find new money we would have to cut it out of old programs . " Governor Rockefeller said . " And that is true for the current year . But-they are not considering the'groWth of existing revenues in the years to come . " There was no effective measure of support generated for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Governors for more money without increasing local taxes there has been an obvious appeal that Governor Rockefeller has characterized as " very encouraging . "
