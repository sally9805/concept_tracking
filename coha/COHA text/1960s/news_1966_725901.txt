The final game of the 1966 world series was shown on television in edited form . The Baltimore Orioles dispatched the Los Angeles Dodgers in just 40 minutes .

He spoke of " a double hit " and " a treble " and said people should keep their eyes on " the left outfielder . " How 's That Again ?

Frank Big Hit Another said admiringly , " The throwing was in a single rationalized flick of the wrist . " He said of Frank Robinson 's winning home run , " It was a most colossal blow  --  and after all , he was using a round bat . " The conclusion on the screen and in the pub was that baseball , at least as played in the world series , was more professional and more exciting than cricket . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I hate exciting games , " one television panel member said . " The great charm of cricket is that it 's dull . After all baseball is not an art form . "
