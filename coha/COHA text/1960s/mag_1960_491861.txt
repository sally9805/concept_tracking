Deadbeats Are My Business when one of our men leaves the office on a delicate mission , we have our own way of sending him off properly inspired . We , admonish him , " Remember , G.T.M. ? " My business is bill collecting , and " G.T.M. " is short for " get the money ! " This has always been the ' unwritten credo of our fraternity . Lately , however , the process of extracting cash from debtors  --  we hesitate to call them " deadbeats , " just as doctors rarely write off a patient as " hopeless " ? has been elevated to new plateaus of efficiency . We no longer dispatch operatives into the hallways of apartment houses to yell for all the neighbors to hear , " Mrs. Murphy , it:s the bill collector ! " Today we resort to more advanced psychology . And as the only full-time psychologist employed by any collection agency I know of , I 'm proud to be acknowledged as one of the pioneers who are turning the art of dunning into a science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relish about bill collecting is that the psychology of debtors is relatively uncharted territory and lends itself to challenging experiments . Not long ago I composed for my firm , National Accounts System , Incorporated , of Chicago , what I considered a scientifically near-perfect collection letter . Its forty-three words drew on most of the cardinal principles of dunning which I shall analyze in this article . It read : Your continued refusal to stand up to your problems in a mature and responsible manner can only lead to inure trouble . The amount involved here is too large to be forgotten . Call us immediately and make arrangements to settle this out of court . This , I submit , is a perfectly infuriating letter . Unfortunately our debtors agree with me only too readily , The letter made them so cross that it netted little money and had to be abandoned . Most of my new techniques arc working nicely , however . For example , most debtors who visit collection agencies arc received in private . Not in our agency , though . We talk to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big , busy office . They arc shielded only by head-high glass panes on both sides . I thought this was the arrangement best suited to get across the impression that we 're a scrupulously ethical financial institution  --  like a bank . Incidentally , this is perfectly true . Our offices in Chicago and seven other Midwestern cities collect more than K000,000 annually ; our clients include major utility companies , national corporations and some of Chicago 's bkst-known State Street stores . Our semipublic debtor 's booth tends to discourage tears , shouting or other inflamed conduct , though not always . On occasion we have had callers burst in with the announced intention of beating up certain of our collectors . So far we have been able to calm down these visitors by tr fling them that the collectors were " not IL Recently a 275-pound woman , after unsuccehsfully trying to persuade us to release a garnishment on her husband 's pay check , advised us that she and her spouse would wait across the street at five P.M . to shoot the two collectors she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . Usually we dissuade these overactive specimens simply by sticking to our subject . Thus , when a fellow who owed a one-year-old hospital bill for $.257 threatened on the phone to come by and split the collector 's head open . our man said , " Come ahead , but do n't forget the money ! " The debtor never materialized , but the money eventually did . NVhen debtors come to see us to make payments , our cashier is instructed to start at once writing out receipts for the full amount owed . When the debtor offers five dollars on account , she looks up in surprise and says , " Oh , I 'm not authorized to accept partial payment . You 'll have to talk to the manager . " By the time the manager arrives the debtor is on the defensive and is apt to offer ten dollars , maybe more . We take it . Our debtor 's booth also inhibits visitors from stringing out the red-herring excuses with which they come so amply equipped . Occasionally we find a debtor who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I recall  --  and which we caused to be canceled  --  was for $14.8 to cover the delivery of a baby . It was from a hospital where our debtor had arrived so late that the youngster was born on the lawn . But most excuses we hear are bald and transparent lies . To listen to tem , you 'd think half the population was permanently hospitalized . Authentic excuses arc equally depressing . " I live too high , " some unabashed debtors tell us . " I 've got to go on vacation , " is another popular theme . A call girl accused us of ruining her business because the telephone company shut down service for nonpayment of phone bills . Patiently we explain to these types that their problems wo n't be solved without positive action , that they are merely confronting obligations they should have met long before , and that we want the money  --  now . Sometimes , I admit , a debtor 's attitude entices us to go beyond the call of duty . Two years ago , while trying to collect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our collectors ran up against a lady who cackled gaily at his predicament . " That 's one bill you wo n't collect , " she said . " My husband 's buried in that suit ! " Whereupon our man bluffed and said he 'd call the coroner " to get that suit . " The woman paid . To lead debtors to the point of paying , we have to catch them first . This may require an intricate campaign . Bill collecting is big business these days -- $85,000,000 worth of overdue bills are referred to collection agencies every month . Fortunately we find that our collectors need not visit most debtors . Nearly all their collecting can be done by mail or phone . When debtors have no phone , we find it most effective to call neighbors and ask them to call the delinquent to the line . But quite a few debtors who do have telephones are more or less permanently " out " to us . It occurred to me , therefore , that it would save time and money to persuade these parties to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by stimulating their curiosity . As a first step we may send them a card suggesting that they contact " this office " and giving no further details . The card 's dignified typography suggests that the recipient is dealing with a big outfit that 's got his number ; and bigness is respected in America . The card is mailed in a narrow envelope , which permits the conclusion that it might contain a check . If the debtor decides to return it unopened to give us the idea that we do n't have his current address , chances arc he will unwittingly confirm his whereabouts by writing on the envelope " Not here . " If we 're really barking up the wrong address , the postman almost certainly will write on it " Not there . " If Mr. Debtor ignores our first card , I 'm ready with more bait , It 's a post card with this message , reproduced by photo offset , but appearing to be hand written : " I have tried to reach you several times on a matter important to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one of our phone numbers and the signature of the collector working on the case . Or , rather , his pseudonym . Few of our collectors use their real names at work . Some of their names are too complicated to be readily understood on the telephone . Also , we like to protect our men from annoying calls or letters at their homes . If none of this titillates an elusive debtor 's curiosity , we send him one of my new creations  --  the " page two letter . " This note-sized sheet is marked PAGE Two at the top and begins : and I am sure you realize we did not wish to do this . However , if you get in touch with us today , we may be able to help . Our phone number This suggests that we accidentally forgot to send along a " page one " containing word of something unpleasant that is about to occur , but can still be stopped . The trouble is that I must constantly withdraw such splendid innovations and replace them with new ideas because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they adjust all too rapidly to our ways . Just recently I got a letter from one wiseacre who marked his note PAGE THREE and started out : most assiduously , no you can see you left me no choice . Your situation may not be entirely hopeless , however , if you will contact me ... . When a debtor responds to one of our curiosity stimulators , he is at an automatic disadvantage because he does n't know why he is calling and we do . Our collectors arc under orders to press their advantage fast and hard , especially if the caller is a " skip " ? a debtor whose current address we have been seeking and whose place of employment we need to know , perhaps to attach his pay check . Such calls come in on special lines which our men answer only with " Hello . " The usual sequence goes something like this : DEBTOR : 1 got a card to call a Mr. Baker . CQLLECTOR : Yes , what is your name ? D : John Smith C : Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the XYZ Company C : Where are you calling from ? ... The debtor may be wary right away and refuse the information . If he says , " What do you want that for ? " our man replies , " I need it to find your file . " It 's always a " file , " by the way , never something as flimsy as a " card . " If the debtor asks , " What file ? " our man says , " Well , your tile . " Sometimes money can be made in this business by sounding even more stupid than the other fellow . He may get so impatient at your thickheadedness that he tells you what you want to know . Suppose the debtor hangs up . Then the collector calls back and inquires courteously , " Were we disconnected ? " Suppose the debtor hangs up again . Then it may be worth while to put in the call again and let his phone ring for five or ten minutes . This might make the debtor 's wife angry at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the seriousness of their husbands ' fiscal sins we often turn the women into twenty-fourhour-a-day collectors ' deputies , who wheedle money out of their men and pay us . Women do this because they worry about their family 's reputation and neighborhood gossip about , say , repossession of their furniture . Also , women frequently anticipate the worst . To them , any night noise can sound like a tornado instead of a train . I 'd say our business deals with about 2 per cent of the population , and the other 98 would be surprised at the lengths to which debtors will go just to avoid paying us . They change their names . They teach their children to lie about the parents ' whereabouts . They drop friends and relatives and leave town . They impersonate their bosses on the telephone . They join the Army . They switch to lower-paying civil-service jobs where their salaries can not be attached . Some eventually take the legal consequences like the Milwaukee woman whose spouse owed 512.99 for records and who wrote us : " My husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mostly , though , they argue . My , how they argue ! They did n't get the bill . The merchandise was no good . They sent the money  --  but " lost " the money-order receipt . It takes a first-rate collector to follow the counsel I give our men : Do n't argue back ; forget the past ; let them lie and save face ; tell them they 're now on notice and the money is due today ! Frankly I feel we 're dealing with lemon peels . Our average debtor owes a total of 51900 in various bills . How much we can squeeze out of him depends in part on how many other creditors got there first . But when we apply psychologically sound pressures , we find we can wring some money out of almost anyone . In fact , we collect an estimated 79 per cent ' of the bills from those debtors we can locate . This is remarkably high and compares with a national average of approximately 55 per cent . For our big clients who operate nationally I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much irksome personal contact with debtors : I have automated the dunning sequence . Data from the 9000 overdue accounts which a large phonograph-record club sends us monthly is fed to processing machines which make out and address a series of notices I composed . My messages follow certain psychological precepts : 1 . We must motivate the debtor to pay up by lighting within him the fires of anxiety and fear . 2 . We must threaten the debtor , but only with acts that he can expect us to carry out . The certain prospect of unpleasant consequences is more dreaded than the possibility of ' total catastrophe ; more people worry about next week 's definite problems than about the possibility of atomic war . 3 . Our tone must be compelling enough to invite no back talk . 4 . Having placed the debtor in his hole , we must show him how he can climb out  --  right now ! 5 . Debtors cultivate the habit of forgetfulness , and so our notices must hit them while our previous reminders remain fresh in their minds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our collectors : " Fear drops off sharply as the distance in time or space from the thing which is feared increases . Mother may promise Junior a spanking when father comes home , but Junior does n't really begin to worry until shortly before he expects dad . " I 'd like to mail notices every three days . Unfortunately this does not give debtors enough time to reply . So we have my missives mailed five days apart . This is frequent enough to approximate the techniques of the Spanish Inquisition , when the torturers made drops of water drip-drip-drip on the foreheads of their victims . It 's the cumulative effect that melts resistance . My first notice is a business-machine card stating : " This account has been placed with us for immediate collection . The entire balance is due and payable now . If full payment is received in this office by return mail , this account will not be placed with your local credit bureau . " The card carries our cable address , NASINC . Actually our debtors hardly ever cable us . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are a giant octopus with tentacles from which there is no escape . The second notice is printed in red and marked URGENT . It says : " This account must have your immediate attention . Continued delay will jeopardize your credit standing and may compel us to use more drastic measures . " Notice that we do n't specify what measures we would take . That 's because we ca n't sue anybody . Only our clients cart . On small accounts the legal expenses may not make it worth while , although suits are occasionally filed on them to keep debtors off guard . The third notice is pink and begins with these words in large type : WHAT Is THE MATTER ? ? ? It goes on : " We can not believe that you would risk censure for this sum of money . Take care of this matter today and spare yourself unpleasantness . " The tone here is parental ; as in most of our mail material , I carefully avoided using the word " please ' ' ? and for an important reason . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with person ality deficiencies . At times they can be shocked into action by being treated like children . Here is how it works . Bt the time debtors are referred to us , most credit grantors have already dunned them . This covers the phase we might equate with the request : " Johnny , please pay that bill . " When we take them in hand . we must step up the urgency of the demand by saying , in effect , " Johnny , it 's time to pay that bill now . " If that gets no action , we must order bluntly , " Johnny , pay that bill ! " This last phase is covered by my blue notice  --  the fourth . It is headed , " Further delay can not be tolerated " and promises , " We will resort to other measures if we do not receive payment in full by return mail . " If there is still no response , we turn over the delinquents to our telephone collectors . Accounts of debtors who live in cities where we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my notices will be illustrated , but not by the traditional gay little men pointing at the words " mail now . " To hint at legal action , I will use an accusing finger attached to a hand lurking out from a judicial robe . Scenting will come next . For a while I thought I might make our notices smell of decay , but this would only arouse repugnance . I am searching for ways to inspire fear subliminally . The most likely idea I 've had is to try the odor of charred wood . This suggests fire and has a connotation of urgency . All of this may make me look like a sadist who loves to persecute people . Actually I have reason to believe that my family and friends consider me a rather easy-going , good-humored character . I am forty years old and have trouble keeping down my weight because I love to cook and eat . I like to plant trees and ' putter around my new house in suburban Libertyville . I am happily married to the psychologist of North Chicago High @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kansas City , Missouri , and my father owns a hardware store . I served two hitches in the Navy and got my doctorate in psychology from Northwestern University while working , at 45 various times , as a bookkeeper , bartender and college instructor . I first encountered debtors when 1 became a practicing psychologist in Waukegan , Illinois . Certain identifiable types of patients tended not to pay my bills . Later , when I administered tests and psychotherapy at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Downey , Illinois , I encountered similar personalities . As soon as they were released from our care , they began running up bills they could n't or would n't pay . My own bad accounts I turned over to Gordon Fletcher , a former career Navy chief petty officer who had set up a small collection agency in Waukegan in 1949 . Today , at thirty-seven , Gordon is president of National Accounts System Incorporated , and it is one of the largest agencies in the business . 1 went to work for him full time when he opened his Chicago office two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long before that . One of my first jobs was to test Gordon 's personnel and analyze what makes a good bill collector . I found that the best men harbor a certain hostility , for which their work provides a socially acceptable outlet .. However , too much hostility is dangerous , and we have fired men for excessive enthusiasm . Our most valuable collectors are restless , driven fellows who sit tensely on the edge of their chairs , walk rapidly and derive pleasure from their battle of wits with debtors . We usually pay them between 57200 and 510,400 a year , but no commissions . College training or l.Q. ' s exceeding 110 arc unnecessary , but their telephone voices should convey an " air of command . " The successful collector , my manual says , " should sound like the kind of person whom people expect to obey . " Most of all he must be equipped with a high indignation quotient ? " ! ca n't get away with not paying bills ; why should they ? " It is best for him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , good guys who pay their bills and bad guys who do n't . Otherwise his work might trouble him . Candidly , Gordon himself was once uneasy about being a bill collector and exhibited unrealistic do-good tendencies . He started an employment agency for debtors , out found that most of them did n't last on their jobs . The agency is still in business , but it handles only a few choice debtors . For a short time he ran a budget service to consolidate debtors ' bills and marshal their finances to pay them off , but most of the clients kept breaking the rules and wound up deeper in debt . He cosigned promissory notes for some of his accounts and had to pay off many of them himself . Personally I had some reservations about my job . According to an ethic of our society , many feel that it 's all right to steal from prosperous corporations ; since most credit grantors fall in this category , public sympathy is generally with the debtors . Nobody loves a bill collector . Knowing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in restaurants by telling them I 'm " in research . " In fact , pure research and teaching are what I enjoy most . But I ca n't support my family adequately on the pay prevailing in these fields . Besides , like Gordon , 1 have become convinced that bill collectors perform an indispensable function in our economy . I think of us as credit cops , and each year we have more to police . Consumer credit now outstanding totals slightly more than 550,000,000,000 . This is 55,000,000,000 more than a year ago and almost this= times as much as ten years ago . Competition is no longer merely for the customer 's dollar but for his promise to pay the dollar later . If too many of these promises are broken , merchants must add more and more of the cost of bad debts to the prices everybody else pays . As it is , our services arc not inexpensive . We charge a basic contingency fee of one third of the amount collected . If an account is for less than twenty-five dollars , or is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another collection agency , we charge 50 per cent . We also get half of everything we collect from " skips . " Still , our client companies find that it costs them more to dun slow-paying customers than to let us do it . And it 's better public relations for merchants , after they have nudged their debtors a bit , to have us pursue the operation , like a surgeon called in on a tough case by the family physician . The event that afforded Gordon and me the most revealing insight we have yet had into the psychology of debtors occurred in 1956 . It also helped considerably to quiet whatever twinges of conscience we still felt about being bill collectors . For four hours we conferred with ten of our chronic debtors in Waukegan . We invited a cab driver , two housewives , a civil-service clerk , a plasterer and five factory workers . We paid each 51.50 an hour to give us their reactions to our collection letters and tell us about themselves and their financial problems . The results were depressing . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Thcy lacked the capacity to delay fulfillment of their wants . They were unable to accept responsibility for their actions . They owed for freezers , perfume and expensive hats , not because they felt they " needed " these luxuries but because they " wanted " them , Invariably they blamed the credit grantors for their problems ? " They should n't make it so easy to buy . " Our collection letters struck them as " just more duns " and produced within them amorphous distress , but no desire to act , except perhaps to go out for a drink and forget their WM . As a result our new letters and our collectors ' phone calls now keep pounding at the theme that the debtor can avoid real trouble only if he calls us now and starts paying now . " Pin it down and lock him into a specific commitment , " instructs my manual . " ' O.K. , I 'll get it to you in a few days ' does not mean more than ' You must come over to my place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have conducted surveys indicating that certain time-honored threats used in the collection business are not too effective , notably the threat of a lawsuit . Most debtors are n't sufficiently ' familiar with the trouble a lawsuit can.be . They consider it a remote phenomenon which , like lightning , happens only to others . I tried to overcome this with a brief pamphlet called If You are Sued on a Debt . It warns that " an execution can be issued against you " and that " a judgment hanging over your head will cost you many times the amount of the debt . " But our most effective club , I find , is a threat to the debtor 's job . My most productive letter says only : Do you know that employers frequently ask for credit reports before hiring ? Why handicap yourself with a bad recommendation ? Clear it up by sending or bringing us your payment now . None of this should create the notion that debtors arc a homogeneous herd and respond to the same techniques . On the contrary . While many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that nearly 10 per cent live in areas where family incomes average more than 57000 . Their state of mind at the time we contact them is totally unpredictable . I keep reminding our collectors that it 's their task , like that of any diagnostician , to tap their way into each debtor 's psyche and discover the weakness we can exploit most profitably . A businessman may have to be flattered into paying ? " I 'm sure a man in your position . . . " A low-paid dishwasher may have to he overwhelmed with kindness . A poor fellow should be addressed as " sir , " but a rich , chronically slow-paying society matron can probably be stirred by some blunt talk . Anger has its place as a collector 's technique , but it must be employed sparingly and only if our man has deliberately determined that it is the best way to try for the money . Remarkable results can be reaped from a change in the collector 's voice level , perhaps from a near shout to a near whisper . If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respond admirably to a collector 's chuckle and the comment that it was a nice try , but really sort of silly , was n't it ? I think it 's fair to say that it 's the hunter 's spirit that keeps us going strong at National Accounts System , and nowhere is this more necessary than in " skip tracing . " To locate a debtor who has decamped from his last-known address is so time consuming that each case costs us money . We do it as a customer service , and most of this kind of work is reserved for one of my favorite people . Oscar Safran . Oscar is an artist . Alone in a huge empty office six floors above us , he hugs his telephones and hunts " skips . " He used to work for a loan company and happens to be a superb impersonator . All day he calls the relatives , former landlords , neighbors and employers of debtors . If the debtor is of Irish extraction , Oscar turns Irish and adopts a suitable name . If the prey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the insurance man checking on a new group-hospitalization policy , or an ex-G1 in need of a loan from his former buddy in the old outfit . Often he is a truck driver who found a billfold full of cash belonging to the debtor , but containing only the telephone number of the relative he is calling ? " Look , lady , I 'm in a phone booth , and 1 got ta be at the stockyards in fifteen minutes ! Does he want the money or do n't he ? " Oscar frequently traces " skips " to graveyards . When he does , he gets the lot number , because he is , like all of us , a dedicated man .
