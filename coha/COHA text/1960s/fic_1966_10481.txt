( 40 ) BOOK I " It 's always different for a man . " Mary sat down at the table in front of the mirror and began to brush her hair . " Brock is secretly negotiating with the Spaniards in Manila for the sugar crop . He 's offered Carlos de Silvera ten percent for the monopoly . " Struan felt a surge of fury . If Brock could work that trick with sugar , he could dominate the whole Philippine market . " How do you know ? " " His compradore , Sze-tsin , told me . " " He 's another of your  --  clients ? " " Yes . " " Anything else you want to tell me ? " " You could make a hundred thousand taels of silver from what I 've told you . " " Have you finished ? " " Yes . " Struan got up .

No , that 's not honest either . No one could have helped me . I like what I am . I swear I will never change . I will be what I am : either secretly , and no one knowing except you and me  --  or openly . So why hurt others ? Why hurt Horatio ? " Struan looked down at her .

" Struan had left her to her joss . She had a right to live as she pleased , and exposing her to the community would solve nothing . Worse , it would destroy her devoted brother . He had used her information to immense profit . Because of Mary , The Noble House had almost a total monopoly of all opium trade for a year , and more than made back the cost of their share of the opium  --  twelve thousand cases  --  that had ransomed the Settlement . And Mary 's informationabout Brock had been correct and Brock had been stopped . Struan had opened a secret account for Mary in England and paid into the accounta proportion of the profit . She had thanked him but had never seemed interested in the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But she would never tell him how she started her double life , or why . Great God in Heaven , he thought , I 'll never understand people ... . And now , on the beach , he was wondering what Horatio would do when he found out . Impossible for Mary to keep her second life secret  --  she was sure to make a mistake . " What 's the matter , Mr. Struan ? " Horatio said . " Nothing , lad . Just thinking . " " Do you have a ship leaving today or tomorrow ? " " What ? " " Going to Macao , " Horatio said with a laugh . " To take Mary to Macao . " " Oh , yes . Mary . " Struan collected himself . " Tomorrow , probably . I 'll let you know , lad . " He shoved his way through the merchants , heading for Robb , who was standing near one of the tables , staring out to sea . " What 's next , Mr. Struan ? " Skinner called out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What 's the next move of The Noble House ? " " Build , of course . The first to build 'll be the first to profit , Mr. Skinner . " Struan nodded good-naturedly and continued his way . He wondered what the other merchants  --  even Robb  --  would say if they knew he was the owner of the Oriental Times and that Skinner was his employee . " Na eating , Robb ? " " Later , Dirk . There 's time enough . " " Tea ? " " Thanks . " Cooper wandered over to them and lifted his glass . " To Struan 's Folly ' ? " " If it is , Jeff , " Struan said , " you 'll all come down the sewer with us . " " Aye , " Robb said . " And it 'll be an expensive sewer if Struan 's has anything to do with it .

" " Fifteen thousand at seven cents . " " Done  --  with a guaranteed order for thirty thousand at the same price a year from today and a guarantee you 'll only import through Struan 's . " " Done  --  if you 'll freight a cargo of cotton by the same ship from New Orleans to Liverpool . " " How many tons ? " " Three hundred . Usual terms .

On the morrow they were all going back to the Settlement in Canton to take up residence again . They would take over their factories  --  or bongs , as their business houses in the Orient were called  --  and stay in the Settlement as always until May when the season 's business was over . But for The Noble House to need an agent now in Canton was as foolish as saying the United States of America needed a royal family . " Is it a deal , Jeff ? " " Yes . You 're expecting war again ? " " All life 's trouble , eh ? Is that na what Wolfgang was trying to say ? " " I do n't know . " " How soon will your new ship be ready ? " Struan asked abruptly . Cooper 's eyes narrowed .

" An ' never when half your country 's based on slavery . " " That 'll change in time . Englishmen started it . " " Scum started it ! " Yes , and madmen are continuing it , Cooper thought bitterly , remembering the violent private quarrels he was always having with his partner , who owned plantation slaves and trafficked in them . How could Wilf be so blind ? " You were in the trade up to eight years ago . " " Struan 's was never in human cargo , by God . And by the Lord God , I 'll blow any ship out of the sea I catch doing it . In or out of British waters . We gave the lead to the world . Slavery 's outlawed .

Spend some money , laddie . Gamble a little . Agitate in Washington . Push your partner 's brother . Is n't he a senator from Alabama ? Or is he too busy looking after four godrotting blackbirders and a couple of markets ' in Mobile ? " " You know my opinion on that , by God , " Cooper snapped . " Open up the opium auctions and we 'll trade you off the earth . I think you 're all afraid to compete freely , if the truth was known . Why else keep the NavigationActs in force ? Why make it law that only English ships can carry goods into England ? By what right do you monopolize the biggest consumingmarket on earth ? " " Na by divine right , laddie , " Struan said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy . " " In some things we 're right and you 're wrong . Let 's compete freely . Goddam tariffs ! Free trade and free seas  --  that 's what 's right ! " " Struan 's is with you there . Do you na read the newspapers ? I dinna mind telling you we buy ten thousand votes a year to support six members who 'll vote free trade . We 're trying hard enough . " " One vote , one man . We do n't buy votes . " " You 've your system and we 've ours . And I 'll tell you something else . The British were na for the American wars , either of them . Or for those godrotting Hanoverian kings . You did na win the wars , we lost ' em . Happily . Why should we war on kith and kin ? But if the people of the Isles ever decide to war on the States , watch out , by God . Because you 're fin-ished . " " I think a toast is in order , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two men tore their eyes off each other and stared at him . To their astonishment he poured three glasses . " You 'll na drink , Robb , " Struan said , his voice a lash . " I will . First time on Hong Kong . Last time . " Robb handed them glasses . The whisky was golden-brown and distilled exclusively for The Noble House at Loch Tannoch where they were born . Robb needed the drink ; he needed the keg . " You swore a holy oath ! " " I know . But it 's bad luck to toast in water . And this toast 's important . " Robb 's hand shook as he raised his glass . " Here 's to our future . Here 's to Independence and Independent Cloud . To freedom o ' the seas , To freedomfrom any tyrants . " He took a sip and held the liquor in his mouth , feeling it burn , his body twisting with the need of it . Then he spat it out and poured the remainder on the pebbles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of my hand . " He turned away , nauseated , and walked inland . " That took more strength than I have , " Cooper said . " Robb 's sick in the head to tempt the Devil like that , " Struan said . Robb had begun to drink to the point of insanity six years ago . The preceding year Sarah had come to Macao from Scotland with the children . For a time everything had been grand , but then she had found out about Robb 's Chinese mistress of years , Ming Soo , and about their daughter . Struan remembered Sarah 's rage and Robb 's anguish , and he was sad for both of them . They should have been divorced years ago , he thought , and he damned the fact that a divorce could be obtained only by Act of Parliament . At length Sarah had agreed to forgive Robb , but only if he would swear by God to immediately rid himself forever of his adored mistress and their daughter . Hating himself , Robb had agreed . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she and their daughter had left Macao . He had never seen them or heard of them again . But though Sarah relented , she never forgot the beautiful girl and child and continued to salt the ever-open wound . Robb had begun drinking heavily . Soon the drink ruled him and he was besotted for months on end . Then one day he had disappeared . Eventually Struan had found him in one of the stinking gin cellars in Macao and had carried him home and sobered him ; then he had given him a gun . " Shoot yoursel ' or swear by God you 'll na touch drink again . It 's poison to you , Robb . You 've been drunk for almost a year . You 've the children to think of . The poor bairns are terrified of you and rightly ; and I 'm tired of pulling you out of gutters . Look at yoursel ' , Robb ! Go on ! " Struan had forced him to look into a mirror . Robb had sworn , and then Struan had sent him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be given no liquor . Robb had almost died . In time he had become himself again , and he had thanked his brother and lived with Sarah again and tried to make peace . But there was never peace again between them  --  or love . PoorTAI-PAN ( 45 ) BOOK IRobb , Struan thought . Aye , and poor Sarah . Terrible to live like that , husbandand wife . " What the devil made Robbie do that ? " " I think he wanted to break up a quarrel , " Cooper said . " I was getting angry . Sorry . " " Dinna apologize , Jeff . It was my fault . Well , " Struan added , " let 's na waste Robb 's guts , eh ? His toast ? " They drank silently . All around the shore the merchants and sailors were roistering . " Hey , Tai-Pan ! And you , you blasted colonial ! Come over here ! " It was Quance , seated near the flagpole . He waved at them and shouted again . " Blast it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of snuff , sneezed twice and dusted himself impatiently with a French lace kerchief .

" " Did you try the brandy , Mr. Quance ? " " Impeccable , my dear fellow . Like Miss Tillman 's tits . " He took the painting off the easel and held it up . " What do you think ? " " About Shevaun Tillman ? " " The painting . Great spheroids of balderdash , how can you think about a doxy 's tail when you 're in the presence of a masterpiece ? " Quance took another pinch of snuff and choked , and gulped from his tankard of Napoleonbrandy and sneezed . The painting was a water color of the day 's ceremony . Delicate . Faithful .

" " Outside of the Tai-Pan and Robb , I 've the biggest Quance collection in the Far East . " " Dammit , gentlemen , I 've got to get some money from somewhere ! " " Sell it to Brock . You can see him right smartly , " Struan said . " The pox on Brock ! " Quance took a very large gulp of brandy and said , his voice hoarse , " He turned me down , blast him ! " and he dabbed furiously with his paintbrush and now Brock was gone . " By God , why should I make him immortal ? And a pox on both of you . I 'll send it to the Royal Academy . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to pay the freight ? And insurance ? " " I will , my boy . " TAI-PAN ( 46 ) BOOK I " With what ? " Quance contemplated the painting . He knew that even in old age he could still paint and improve ; his talent would not deteriorate . " With what , Mr. Quance ? " He waved an imperious hand at Struan . " Money . Taels . Brass . Dollars . Cash ! " " You 've a new line of credit , Mr. Quance ? " But Quance did not answer . He continued to admire his work , knowing he had hooked his prey . " Come on , Aristotle , who is it ? " Struan insisted . Quance took an enormous gulp of brandy and more snuff and sneezed . He whispered conspiratorially , " Sit down . " He looked to see there was no one else listening . " A secret . " He held up the painting . " Twenty guineas ? " " All right , " Struan said . " But it better be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , Tai-Pan . Snuff ? " " Get on with it ! " " It seems that a certain lady admires herself greatly . In a mirror . With no clothes on . I 've been commissioned to paint her thus . " " Great God Almighty ! Who ? " " You both know her very well . " Then Quance added with mock sadness , " I am sworn not to reveal her name . But I shall put her posterior into posterity . It 's superb . " Another gulp of brandy . " I , er , insisted on seeing her all . Before I agreed to accept the commission . " He kissed his fingers in ecstasy . " Impeccable , gentlemen , impeccable ! And her tits ! Good God on high , nearly gave me the vapors ! " Another gulp of brandy . " You can tell us . Come on , who ? " " First rule in nudes as in fornication . Never reveal the lady 's name . " Quance finished the tankard regretfully . " But not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to own it . " He got up and belched heartily and dusted himself down and closed his paint box and picked up his easel , enormously pleased with himself . " Well , that 's enough business for this week . I 'll call on your compradore for thirty guineas . " " Twenty guineas , " Struan said . " A Quance original of the most important day in the history of the Orient , " Quance said scornfully , " for hardly the price of a hogshead of Napoleon . " He returned to his longboat and danced a jig as he was cheered aboard . " Good God Almighty , who ? " Cooper said at length . " Must be Shevaun , " Struan said , with a short laugh . " Just the sort of thing that young lady would do . " " Never . She 's wild , yes , but not that wild . " Cooper glanced uneasily at the Cooper-Tillman depot ship where Shevaun Tillman was staying .

And they all had been refused but not refused : held on a rein , as she held all her suitors . But Cooper did not mind ; he knew she was going to be his wife . She had been sent out under the guardianship of Wilf Tillman by her father , a senator from Alabama , in the hope that Cooper would favor her and she would favor him , to further cement the family business . And he had fallen in love with her the moment he had seen her . " Then we 'll announce the betrothal immediately , " Tillman had said delightedlya year ago . " No , Wilf . There 's no hurry . Let her get used to Asia and used to me . " As Cooper turned back to Struan , he smiled to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It must be one of Mrs. Fortheringill 's young ladies .

Her clientele 's the best in Asia . Can you imagine that hag giving money to Aristotle ? " Cooper pulled impatiently at his muttonchop whiskers . " Best she 'd do is give it to him in trade . Perhaps he 's joking with us ? " " He jokes about everything and anything . But never about painting . " " One of the Portuguese ? " " Impossible . If she 's married , her husband 'd blow her head off . If she 's a widow  --  that 'd blow the top off the whole Catholic Church . " The weatheredlines of Struan 's face twisted into a grin .

A ship was charging through the east channel under full sail . Her freeliftingsquare sails and gallants and royals and topgallants were swelling to leeward , cut into rotund patterns by the buntlines and leach lines , her taut rigging straining and singing against the quickening wind . The rakemastedClipper was on the lee tack on a broad reach and her bow wave flew upward , her gunnel awash , and above the froth of her wake  --  white against the green-blue ocean  --  sea gulls cried their welcome .

" Struan called , but the bosun was already hurrying over to him with the double telescope . " Three days early an ' record time , sorr , " Bosun McKay said with a toothless smile . " Och aye , look at her fly . She 'll cost Brock a barrel of silver ! " He hurried inland . The ship , Thunder Cloud , came barreling out of the channel , and now that she was clear , she ran before the wind and gathered speed . Struan put the short double telescope to his eyes and focused on the code flags he was seeking . The message read : " Crisis not resolved . New treaty with Ottoman Empire against France . Talk of war . " Then Struan studied the ship ; her paint was good , her rigging taut , her guns in place . And in one corner of her fore-royal sail was a small black patch , a code sign , used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He lowered the binoculars and offered them to Cooper . " Do you want to borrow them ? " " Thanks . " " They 're called bi-oculars , or binoculars . Two eyes . You focus with the central screw , " Struan said . " I had them made specially . " Cooper peered through them and saw the code flags . He knew that everyone in the fleet was trying to read their message and that all companies spent much time and money trying to break the code of The Noble House . The binoculars were more powerful than a telescope . " Where can I get a gross of these ? " " A hundred guineas apiece . A year to deliver . " Take it or leave it , Cooper thought bitterly , knowing the tone of voice . " Done . " New code flags were raised , and Cooper handed the binoculars back . The second message was a single word , " Zenith , " a code within the master code . " If I were you , " Struan said to Cooper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a hurry . " " may ? " Struan shrugged . " Just trying to be of service . You 'll excuse me ? " Cooper watched him leave to intercept Robb , who was approaching with the bosun . What 's in those goddam flags ? he asked himself . And what did he mean about our cotton ? And why the hell has n't the mail ship arrived ? This was what made trading so exciting . You bought and sold for a market four months ahead , knowing only the market position of four months ago . A mistake and the inside of a debtors ' prison you 'd see . A calculated gamble that came off and you could retire and never know the Orient again . A wave of pain swept up from his bowels . Pain of the Orient that was always with him  --  with most of them  --  and a way of life . Was it a friendly tip of the Tai-Pan 's or a calculated ploy ?

Glessing wondered what the flags had meant . And why there was a black patch on the fore-royal . " Beautiful ship , " Horatio said . " Yes , she is . " " Even though she 's a pirate ? " Horatio asked ironically . " Her cargo and owners make her a pirate . A ship 's a ship , and that 's one of the most gorgeous ladies who ever served man , " Glessing answered crisply , unamused by Horatio 's wit . " Speaking of ladies , " he said , trying not to be obvious , " would you and Miss Sinclair care to sup with me tonight ? I 'd like to show you around my ship .

" Very well , " Glessing said . " Miss Sinclair will be the first lady I 've entertainedaboard . " Good God , Horatio thought , could Glessing have more than a fleeting interest in Mary ? Of course ! The invitation was really for her , not me . What a nerve ! Pompous ass ! To think that Mary would even consider such a match . Or that I would allow her to many yet !

" The master-at-arms picked up Norden 's musket and threw it to another marine and marched the men away . When it was safe to move , Norden  --  who had only pretended to faint  --  slipped into the lee of some rocks and hid . Oh Lord Jesus , protect me till I can get to the Tai-Pan , he prayed desperately . I 'll never get an opportunitylike this again . Protect me , oh Blessed Jesus and help me get to him afore they come back for me . Brock was standing on the quarterdeck of his ship , his telescope trained on the flags .

" " I dinna ken , " Struan said . Zenith meant " Owner to come aboard  --  urgent . " He frowned at Thunder Cloud . Bosun McKay was out of earshot down the beach , waiting patiently . " You go aboard , Robb . Give Isaac my compliments and tell him to come ashore at once . Bring him to the valley . " " Why ? " " Too many ears aboard . It might be very important . " Then he called out , " Bosun McKay ! " " Aye , aye , son . " McKay hurried np to him . " Take Mr. Struan to Thunder Cloud . Then go over to my ship . Get a tent and a bed and my things . I 'll be staying ashore tonight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aye , sorr ! Beggin ' yor pardon , sorr , " Bosun McKay said awkwardly . " There 's a young lad . Ramsey . In H.M.S. Mermaid , Glessing 's ship .

" Struan asked impatiently . " I heard , sorr , " the bosun said carefully , " he 'd like a berth somewheres . " " God 's blood , are you simple in the head ? We take no deserters aboard our ships . If we take one knowingly , we could lose our ship  --  and rightly ! " " S'truth ! I thought you might buy him out , " McKay said quickly , " seeing as how Capt'n Glessing 's a friend o ' yorn . My prize money 'll go to help , sorr . He 's a gud lad and he 'll jump ship if he 's nothing ahead . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sorr . " The bosun touched his forelock and scuttled away . " Robb , if you were Tai-Pan , what would you do ? " " Pressed men are always dangerous and never to be trusted , " Robb said instantly . " So I 'd never buy him out . And now I 'd watch McKay . Perhaps McKay 's now Brock 's man and put up to it . I 'd put McKay to the test . I 'd get intermediaries  --  probably McKay as part of the test , and also an enemy of McKay 's  --  and string Ramsey along and never trust his information . " " You 've told me what I 'd do , " Struan said with a glint of humor . " I asked what you 'd do . " " I 'm not Tai-Pan , so it 's not my problem . If I was , I probably would n't tell you anyway . Or I might tell you and then do the opposite . To test you . " Robb was glad that he could hate his brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much greater . " Why 're you afraid , Robb ? " " I 'll tell you in a year . " Robb walked after the bosun . For a time Struan mused about his brother and the future of The Noble House ; then he picked up a bottle of brandy and began to walk along the cleft of rocks toward the valley . The ranks of the merchants were thinning and some were already leaving in their longboats . Others were still eating and drinking , and there were gusts of laughter at some who were dancing a drunken eightsome reel . " Sir ! " Struan stopped and stared at the young marine . " Aye ? " " I need your help , sir . Desperate , " Norden said , his eyes strange , his face gray . " What help ? " Struan was grimly conscious of the marine 's side arm , a bayonet . " I 've the pox  --  woman sickness . You can help . Give me the cure , sir . Anything , I 'll do anything . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the hairs on his neck rising . " Should you na be at your boat ?

" I 've never had it , lad . " Struan noticed the master-at-arms starting toward them , calling out something that sounded like a name . " You 'd better get to your boat , lad . They 're waiting for you . " " The cure . Tell me how . I 've me savings , sir . " Norden pulled out a filthy , knotted rag and offered it proudly , sweat streaking his face .

" " I 've never had the woman sickness , lad . Never , " Struan said again , his heart grinding at the memory of his childhood when wealth was pennies and shillings and half shillings and not bullion in tens of thousands of taels . And living again the never-to-be-forgotten horror of all his youth  --  of no-money and no-hope and no-food and no-warmth and no-roof and the bloated heaving stomachs of the children . Good sweet Jesus , I can forget my own hunger , but never the children , never their cries on a starving wind in a cesspool of a street . " I 'll do anything , anything , sir . Here . I can pay . I do n't want nuffink for nuffink . Here , sir . " The master-at-arms was striding up the beach . " Norden ! " he shouted angrily . " You 'll get fifty lashes for breaking ranks , by God !

" the master-at-arms shouted from a hundred yards away , red with rage . " God 's blood , come here , you godrotting bastard ! " " Please , sir , " Norden said with growing desperation . " I heard you got cured by the heathen . You bought the cure from the heathen ! " " Then you heard a lie . There 's no Chinese cure that I know of . No cure . None . You 'd better get back to your boat . " " Course there 's a cure ! " Norden shrieked . He jerked out his bayonet . " You tell me where to get it or I 'll cut your sodding gizzard open ! " The master-at-arms broke into a horrified run . " Norden ! " A few on the beach turned around , startled : Cooper and Horatio and another . They began to run toward them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foaming , he hurled himself at Struan and slashed at him viciously , but Struan sidestepped and waited without fear , knowing that he could kill Norden at will . It seemed to Norden that he was surrounded by devil-giants all with the same face , but he could never touch one of them . He felt the air explode from his lungs and the beach smash into his face , and he seemed to be suspended in painless agony . Then there was blackness . The master-at-arms rolled off Norden 's back and hacked down with his fist again , He grabbed Norden and shook him like a rag doll and threwTAI-PAN ( 5-4 ) BOOK Ihim down again . " What the devil happened to him ? " he said , getting up , his face mottled with rage . " You all right , Mr. Struan ? " " Yes . " Cooper and Horatio and some of the merchants hurried up . " What 's the matter ? " Struan carefully turned Norden over with his foot . " The poor fool 's got woman sickness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Better get away from him , Tai-Pan , " Cooper said . " If you breathe his flux you could catch it . " " The poor fool thought I 'd had the disease and got cured . By the Cross , if I knew the cure for that I 'd be the richest man on the earth . " " I 'll have the bugger put in irons , Mr. Struan , " the master-at-arms said . " Cap'n Glessing 'll make him wisht he never been born . " " Just get a spade , " Struan said . " He 's dead . " Cooper broke the silence . " First day , first blood . Bad joss . " " Not according to Chinese custom , " Horatio said absently , sickened . " Now his ghost will watch over this place . " " Good omen or bad , " Struan said , " the poor lad 's dead . " " Why does a corpse always look so obscene ? " Horatio asked . No one answered him . " The Lord have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he turned west along the foreshore toward the crest that came down from the mountain ridge and almost touched the sea . He was full of foreboding as he drank in the good clean air and smelled the tang of the spray . That 's bad joss , he told himself . Very bad . As he neared the crest , his premonition intensified , and when at last he stood in the floor of the valley where he had decided the town would be built , he felt for the third time a vastness of hate surround him . " Good sweet Christ , " he said aloud . " What 's the matter with me ? " He had never known such terror before . Trying to hold it in check , he squinted up at the knoll where the Great House would be , and , abruptly , he realized why the island was hostile . He laughed aloud . " If I were you , Island , I 'd hate me too . You hate the plan ! Well , I tell you , Island , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear ? China needs the world and the world needs China . And you 're the key to unlock the gates of China , and you know it and I know it , and that 's what I 'm going to do , and you 're going to help ! " Stop it , he said to himself . You 're acting like a madman . Aye , and they 'd all think you mad if you told them that your secret purpose was not just to get rich on trade and to leave . But to use riches and power to open up China to the world and particularly to British culture and British law so that each could learn from the other and grow to the benefit of both . Aye . It 's a dream of a madman . But he was certain that China had something special to offer the world . What it was , he did not know . One day perhaps he would find out . TAI-PAN ( 55 ) BOOK I " And we 've something special to offer as well , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And if it 's na defiled in the giving . You 're British soil for better or worse .

And last , if The Noble House ever turns its back on you  --  destroy it with my blessing . " He hiked up the knoll and , unsheathing his dirk , cut two long branches . He cleaved one and thrust it into the ground and with the other formed a crude cross . He doused the cross with brandy and lit it . Those in the fleet who could see into the valley , and who noticed the smoke and the flame , found their telescopes and saw the burning cross and the Tai-Pan beside it , and they shuddered to themselves superstitiously and wondered what devilment he was up to . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summons to the clan , and to all the kinsmen of all kindred clans : a summons to rally to the cross for battle . And the burning cross was raised only by the chief of the clan . By ancient law , once raised , the burning cross committed the clan to defend the land unto the end of the clan . CHAPTER 2 " WELCOME aboard , Robb , " Captain Isaac Perry said . " Tea ? " " Thank you , Isaac . " Robb sat back gratefully in the deep leather sea chair , smelling its tangy perfume , and waited . No one could hurry Perry , not even the Tai-Pan . Perry poured the tea into porcelain cups . He was thin but incredibly strong . His hair was the color of old hemp , brown with threads of silver and black . His beard was grizzled and his face scarred , and he smelled of tarred hemp and salt spray . " Good voyage ? " Robb asked . " Excellent . " Robb was happy as always to be in the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters . The fittings throughout the ship were brass and copper and mahogany , and the sails the finest canvas and the ropes always new . Cannon perfect . Best powder . It was the Tai-Pan 's policy throughout his fleet to give his officers  --  and men  --  the finest quarters and the best food and a share of the profits , and there was always a doctor aboard . And flogging was outlawed . There was only one punishment for cowardice or disobedience , officer or seaman : to be put ashore at the first port and never given a second chance . So seamen and officers fought to be part of the fleet and there was never a berth empty . The Tai-Pan had never forgotten his first ships and the fo'c'sles or his floggings . Or the men that had ordered them . Some of the men had died before he found them . Those that be found he broke . Only Brock he had not touched . Robb did not know why his brother had spared Brock . He shuddered , knowing that whatever the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added a spoonful of sugar and condensed milk . He handed Robb a cup , then sat behind the mahogany sea desk and peered out from eyes that were deep-set under shaggy brows . " Mr. Struan 's in good health ? " " As always . You expected him to be sick ? " " No . " There was a knock on the cabin door . " Come in ! " The door opened and Robb gaped at the young man standing there . " Great God , Culum lad , where 'd you come from ? " He got up excitedly , knocking his cup over . " Very important dispatches ' indeed  --  and of course Zenith ' ! " Culum Struan entered the cabin and shut the door . Robb heldTAI-PAN ( 57 ) BOOK Ihim affectionately by the shoulders , then noticed his pallor and sunken cheeks . ' What 's amiss , lad ? " he asked anxiously . " I 'm much better , thank you , Uncle , " Culum said , the voice too thin . " Better from what , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Culum said , puzzled . Robb whirled on Perry . " You 've got plague aboard ? In Christ 's name , why are n't you flying the Yellow Jack ? " " Of course there 's no plague aboard ! It was in Scotland months ago . " Perry stopped . " Scarlet Cloud ! She never arrived ? " " Four weeks overdue . No word , nothing . What 's happened ? Come on , man ! " " Shall I tell him , Culum lad , or do you want to ? " " Where 's father ? " Culum asked Robb . " Ashore . He 's waiting for you ashore . At the valley . For the love of God , what 's happened , Culum ? " " Plague came to Glasgow in June , " Culum said dully . " They say it came by ship again . From Bengal  --  India . First to Sutherland , then Edinburgh , then it came to us in Glasgow . Mother 's dead , Ian , Lechie , Grandma  --  Winifred 's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " He made a helpless gesture and sat on the arm of the sea chair . " Grandma 's dead . Mother . Aunt Uthenia and the babies and her husband . Ten , twenty thousand died between June and September . Then the plague disappeared . It just disappeared . " " Roddy ? What about Roddy ? My son 's dead ? " Robb said in anguish . " No , Uncle . Roddy 's fine . He was n't touched . " " You 're certain , are you , Culum ? My son 's safe ? " " Yes . I saw him the day before I left . Very few at his school got the plague . " " Thank God ! " Robb shivered , remembering the first wave of the plague that had mysteriously swept Europe ten years ago . Fifty thousand deaths in England alone . A million in Europe . Thousands in New York and New Orleans . Some called this plague by a newer name  --  cholera . " Your mother 's dead ? " Robb said , unbelieving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . And Aunt Susan and Cousin Clair and Aunt Uthenia , Cousin Donald and little Stewart and . . " There was a monstrous silence . Perry broke it nervously . " When I berthed in Glasgow , well , Culum lad was on his own . I did n't know what to do , so I thought it best to bring him aboard . We sailed a month after Scarlet Cloud . " " You did right , Isaac , " Robb heard himself say . How was he going to tellDirk ? " I 'd better go . I 'll signal you to come ashore . You stay aboard . " " No . " Culum said it aloud as though to himself , deep inside . " No . I 'll goashore first . Alone . That 's better . I 'll see Father alone . I must tell him . I'llgo ashore alone . " He got up and quietly walked to the door , the shiprocking smoothly and the sweet sound of the waves lapping , and he left . TAI-PAN ( 58 ) BOOK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll take the dispatches , " he said in his tiny voice . " He 'll want to see the dispatches . " When the long boat pulled away from Thunder Cloud , Struan was on the knoll where the Great House would be . As soon as he saw his eldest son amidships , his heart turned over . " Culummmm ! " he roared exultantly from the top of the knoll . He ripped off his coat and waved it frantically like a man marooned six years who sees his first ship . " Culummmm ! " He tore headlong through the coarse brier toward the shore , careless of the thorns and forgetting the path that led from the shore over the crest to the fishing village and pirate nests on the south side of the island . He forgot everything except that here was his darling son on the first day . Faster . And now he was racing along the shore , ecstatic . Culum saw him first . " Over there . Put in over there . " He pointed at the nearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pull , my hearties , " he said , urging them shoreward . They all knew now , and word was flying through the fleet  --  and , in its wake , anxiety . Between Sutherland and Glasgow lived many a kin and in London Town most of the rest . Culum got up and slipped over the side into the shallows . " Leave us . " He began to splash ashore . Struan ran into the surf that swept the beach , heading straight for his son , and he saw the tears and shouted , " Culum laddie , " and Culum stopped for a moment , helpless , drowned in the abundance of his father 's joy . Then he began running in the surf too , and finally he was safe in his father 's arms . And all the horror of the months burst like an abscess and he was weeping , holding on , holding on , and then Struan was gentling his son and carrying him ashore in his arms and murmuring , " Culum laddie " and " Dinna fash yoursel ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sobbing , " We 're dead  --  we 're all dead  --  Mumma , Ian , Lechie , Granny , aunts , Cousin Clair  --  we 're all dead , Father . There 's only me and Win'fred , and she 's dead by now . " He repeated the names again and again , and they were knives in Struan 's guts . In time Culum slept , spent , safe at last in the strength and warmth . His sleep was dreamless for the first time since the plague had come . He slept that day and the night and part of the next day , and Struan cradled him , rocking him gently . Struan did not notice the passing of the time . Sometimes he would talk with his wife and children  --  Ronalda and Ian and Lechie and Winifred  --  as they sat on the shore beside him . Sometimes when they would go away he would call to them , softly lest he wake Culum , and later they would come back . Sometimes he would sing the gentle lullabies that Ronalda used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother or Catherine , his second mother . Sometimes the mist covered his soul and he saw nothing . When Culum awoke he felt at peace . " Hello , Father . " TAI-PAN ( 59 ) BOOK I " You all right , laddie ? " " I 'm all right now . " He stood up . It was cold on the beach in the shadow of the rock , but in the sun it was warmer . The fleet was quietly at anchor , and tenders scurried back and forth . There were fewer ships than before . " Is that where the Great House 'll be ? " Culum asked , pointing to the knoll . " Aye . That 's where we could live in the autumn till the spring . The climate 's bonny then . " " What 's the valley called ? " " It has na a name . " Struan moved into the sun and tried to dominate the brooding ache in his shoulders and back . " It should have a name . " " Little Karen , your cousin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Happy Valley . We'd 've been happy here . " Struan 's voice grew leaden . " Did they suffer much ? " " Yes . " " Will you tell me about it ? " " Not now . " " Little Winifred . She died before you left ? " " No . But she was very weak . The doctors said that being so weak .. . the doctors just shrugged and went away . " " And Grandpa ? " " The plague never touched him . He came like the wind to us and thenhe took Win'fred . I went to Aunt Uthenia 's to help . But I did n't help . " Struan was facing the harbor without seeing it . " You told Uncle Robb ? " " Yes . Yes , I think I did . " " Poor Robb . I 'd better get aboard . " Struan reached down and picked up the dispatches , half buried in the sand . They were unopened . He wiped the sand off . " I 'm sorry , " Culum said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nay , lad . You gave them to me . " Struan saw a longboat making for shore . Isaac Perry was in the stern . " Afternoon , Mr. Struan , " Perry said cautiously . " Sorry about your loss . " " How 's Robb ? " Perry did not answer . He stepped ashore and barked at the crew , " Hurry it up ! " and Struan wondered through the numbness of his torn mind why Perry was afraid of him . No reason to be afraid . None . The men carried ashore a table and benches and food , tea and brandy and clothes . " Hurry it up ! " Perry repeated irritably . " And stand off ! Get to hell out of here and stand off . " The oarsmen shoved the longboat off quickly and pulled out above the surf and waited , glad to be away . Struan helped Culum into dry clothes and then put on a clean , ruffledTAI-PAN ( 6o ) BOOK Ishirt and warm reefer jacket . Perry helped him off with his soaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does it hurt ? " Culum asked , seeing the foot . " No . " " About Mr. Robb , sir , " Perry said . " After Culum left he went for the liquor . I told him no , but he would n't listen .

I took him aboard China Cloud and put him into his wife 's hands . " " You did right , Isaac . Thank you . " Struan helped Culum to a dish of food  --  beef stew , dumplings , cold chicken , potatoes , hardtack biscuits  --  and took a pewter mug of hot , sweet tea for himself . " His Excellency sends his condolences . He 'd like you to step aboard , at your convenience . " Struan rubbed his face and felt the stubble of his beard , and he wondered why he always felt dirty when his face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's there , " Perry said , indicating a side table . He had anticipatedStruan 's need to spruce up . The Tai-Pan had a fanatical obsession with his personal cleanliness . " There 's hot water . " " Thank you . " Struan soaked a towel in the water and wiped his face and head . Next he lathered his face and shaved deftly without a mirror . Then he dipped a small brush into his mug of tea and began to clean his teeth vigorously . Must be another heathen superstition , Perry thought contemptuously . Teeth grow old and rot and fall out and that 's all there is to it . Struan rinsed his mouth with tea and threw the dregs away . He washed the mug with fresh tea and refilled it and drank deeply . There was a small bottle of cologne with his shaving gear , and he poured a few drops on his hands and rubbed them into his face . He sat down , refreshed . Culum was only toying with the food . " You should eat , lad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Eat anyway . " The wind ruffled Struan 's red-gold hair , which he wore long and uncurled , and he brushed it back . " Is my tent set up , Isaac ?

And to get Chinese herbs to cure distempers and the aftereffect of Bengal plague . " " I 'm all right , Father , thank you , " Culum protested weakly . " I do n't need any heathen witches ' brews . " " They 're na witches as we know witches , lad , " Struan said . " And they 're Chinese , not heathen . Their herbs have saved me many a time . The Orient 's not like Europe .

Aboard there 's not  --  " " God 's blood , Isaac , will you na do as you 're told ? Get the longboat in ! " Perry stiffened momentarily and shouted the longboat ashore . Struan , with Culum beside him , sat amidships , Perry behind them . " Flagship ! " Struan ordered , automatically checking the lie of his ships and the smell of the wind and studying the clouds , trying to read their weather message . The sea was calm . But he could smell trouble . On the way to the flagship Struan read the dispatches . Profits on last year 's teas , good . Perry had made a lucrative voyage , good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Perry had brought from Calcutta ; bad : two hundred and ten thousand pounds sterling of opium lost .

A year 's profit gone . What had happened to her ? Storm or piracy ? Storm , more likely . Unless she 'd run into one of the Spanish or French or American  --  aye , or English  --  privateers that infested the seas . Finally he broke the seal on his banker 's letter . He read it and exploded with rage . " What is it ? " Culum asked , frightened . " Just an old pain . Nothing . It 's nothing . " Struan pretended to read the next dispatch while raging inwardly over the contents of the letter . Good sweet Christ ! " We regret to inform you that , inadvertently and momentarily , credit was overextended and there was a run on the bank , started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our doors open .

A new queen  --  Victoria  --  the first popular monarch in centuries . And her husband Albert  --  he did na ken about him yet , he was a bloody foreigner from Saxe-Coburg , but Parliament was strong now and in control , and that was a new development .

And the unbelievable Industrial Revolution and Britain fantastically wealthy and its riches beginning to spread . New ideas of government and humanity ripping through barriers of centuries . All British , all new . And now the locomotive ! " Now , there 's an invention that 'll rock the world , " he muttered . " What did you say , Father ? " Culum asked . Struan came back into himself . " I was just thinking about our first ride on a train , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorr ? " McKay asked . " What 's it like ? When was that ?

It was the maiden run of the Rocket , on the first passenger train on earth . From Manchester to Liverpool . A day 's run by stagecoach , but we made the journey in an hour and a half . " And once again Struan began to ponder the fate of The Noble House . Then he remembered his instructions to Robb to borrow all the money they could to corner the opium market . Let 's see  --  we could make fifty , a hundred thousand pounds out of that . Aye  --  but a drop in the bucket for what we need . The three million we 're owed for the stolen opium !

At least we 're bankrupt if our creditors fall on us . He felt his son 's hand on his arm . " What did you say , lad ? The Rocket , you were saying ? " Culum was greatly unsettled by Struan 's pallor and the piercing luminousgreen of his eyes . " The flagship . We 're here . " Culum followed his father on deck . He had never been aboard a warship , let alone a capital ship . H.M.S. Titan was one of the most powerful vessels afloat . She was huge  --  triple-masted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Culum was unimpressed .

It was low-ceilinged and they had to stoop as they walked aft heading for the sentry-guarded cabin , and the whole ship smelled of gunpowder and tar and hemp and sweat . " Day , sir , " the marine said to Struan , his musket pointing at him formally . " Master-at-arms ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stamped out of the guard cabin . He was as hard as a cannon ball and his head as round . " Day , Mr. Struan . Just a moment , sirr . " He knocked deferentially on the oak cabin door . A voice said , " Come in , " and he closed the door behind him . Struan took out a cheroot and offered it to Culum . " Are you smoking now , lad ? " " Yes . Thank you , Father . " Struan lit Culum 's cheroot and one for himself . He leaned against one of the twelve-foot-long cannons . The cannon balls were piled neatly , ever ready . Sixty-pound shot . The cabin door opened . Longstaff , a slight , dapper man came out . His hair was dark and fashionably curled , his muttonchop whiskers thick . He had a high forehead and dark eyes . The sentry presented arms and the master-at-arms returned to the guard cabin . " Hello , Dirk , my dear fellow . How are you ? I was so sad to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Culum and offered his hand again . " You must be Culum . I 'm William Longstaff . Sorry that you came under these terrible circumstances . " " Thank you , Your Excellency , " Culum said , astonished that the Captain Superintendent of Trade should be so young . " Do you mind waiting a moment , Dirk ? Admiral 's conference and theTAI-PAN ( 64 ) BOOK Icaptains . I 'll be through in a few minutes , " Longstaff said with a yawn . " I 've a lot to talk to you about . If you 're up to it . " " Yes . " Longstaff glanced anxiously at the gold jeweled fob watch which dangled from his brocade waistcoat . " Almost eleven o'clock ! Never seems to be enough time . Would you like to go down to the wardroom ? " " No . We 'll wait here . " " As you wish . " Longstaff briskly re-entered the cabin and shut the door . " He 's very young to be the plenipotentiary , is n't he ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-six . Empires are built by young men , Culum . They 're lost by old men . " " He does n't look English at all . Is he Welsh ? " " His mother 's Spanish . " Which accounted for his cruel streak , Struan thought to himself . " She was a countess . His father was a diplomat to the court of Spain . It was one of those well-bred ' marriages . His family 's connected with the earls of Toth . " If you 're not born an aristocrat , Culum thought , however clever you are , you have n't a hope . Not a hope . Not without revolution . " Things are very bad in England , " he told his father . " How so , lad ? " Struan said . " The rich are too rich and the poor too poor . People pouring into the cities looking for work . More people than jobs , so the employers pay less and less . People starving . The Chartist leaders are still in prison . " " A good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung or transported , na just put in prison . " " You do n't approve of the Charter ? " Culum was suddenly on his guard . The People 's Charter had been written less than three years ago , and now had become the rallying symbol of liberty to all the discontented of Britain . The Charter demanded a vote for every man , the abolition of the property qualification for members of Parliament , equal electoral districts , vote by secret ballot , annual Parliaments , and salaries for members of Parliament . " I approve of it as a document of fair demands . But na of the Chartists or their leaders . The Charter 's like a lot of basic good ideas  --  they fall into the hands of the wrong leaders . " " It 's not wrong to agitate for reform . Parliament 's got to make changes . " " Agitate , yes . Talk , argue , write petitions , but do n't incite violence and dinna lead revolutions . The Government was right to put down the troublesin Wales and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's tales that the Chartists have na learned their lesson yet and that they 're buying arms and having secret meetings . They should be stamped out , by God . " " You wo n't stamp out the Charter . Too many want it and are prepared to die for it . " " Then there 'll be a lot of deaths , lad . If the Chartists dinna possess themselves with patience . " TAI-PAN ( 65 ) BOOK I " You do n't know what the British Isles are like now , Father . You 've been out here so long . Patience comes hard with an empty belly . " " It 's the same in China . Same all the world over . But revolt and insurrection'sna the British way . " It soon will be , Culum thought grimly , if there are n't changes . He was sorry now that he had left Glasgow for the Orient . Glasgow was the center of the Scottish Chartists and he was leader of the undergraduates who had , in secret , committed themselves to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chartist cause . The cabin door opened again , and the sentry stiffened . The admiral , a heavyset man , strode out , his face taut and angry , and headed for the gangway , followed by his captains . Most of the captains were young but a few were gray-haired . All were dressed in sea uniform and wore cocked hats , and their swords clattered . Captain Glessing was last . He stopped in front of Struan . " Can I offer my condolences , Mr. Struan ? Very bad luck ! " " Aye . " Is it just bad luck , Struan wondered , to lose a bonny wife andthree bonny children ? Or does God  --  or the Devil  --  have a hand in joss ? Orare they  --  God , Devil , luck , joss  --  just different names for the same thing ? " You were quite right to kill that damned marine , " Glessing said . " I did na touch him . " " Oh ? I presumed you did . Could n't see what happened from where I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ashore ? " " No . No point in defiling the island with that sort of disease . Does the name Ramsey mean anything to you , Mr. Struan ? " Glessing asked , bluntly terminating the amenities . " Ramsey 's a common enough name . " Struan was on guard . " True . But Scots stick together . Is n't that a key to the success of Scotdominatedenterprises ? " " It 's hard to find trustworthy people , aye , " Struan said . " Does the name Ramsey mean anything to you ? " " It 's the name of a deserter from my ship , " Glessing said pointedly . " He 's a cousin to your bosun , Bosun McKay , I believe . " " So ? " " Nothing . Just passing along information . As you know , of course , any merchantman , armed or otherwise , which harbors deserters can be taken as prize . By the Royal Navy . " Glessing smiled . " Stupid to desert . Where can he go except onto another ship ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sure that Ramsey was aboard one of his ships and certain that Brock was involved and perhaps Glessing too . " We 're searching the fleet today . You 've no objections , of course ? " " Of course . We 're very careful who man our ships . " " Very wise . The admiral thought The Noble House should have pride of place , so your ships will be searched immediately . " TAI-PAN ( 66 ) BOOK IIn that case , Struan thought , there 's nothing I can do . So he dismissed the problem from his mind . " Captain , I 'd like you to meet my eldest  --  my son , Culum . Culum , this is our famous Captain Glessing who won us the battle of Chuenpi . " " Good day to you . " Glessing shook hands politely . Culum 's hand felt soft and it was long-fingered and slightly feminine . Bit of a dandy , Glessing thought . Waisted frock coat , pale blue cravat and high collar . Must be an undergraduate . Curious to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived . Wonder if I 'd survive . " That was n't a battle . " " Two small frigates against twenty junks of war and thirty or more fire ships ? That 's na a battle ? " " An engagement , Mr. Struan . It could have been a battle . . . " If it had n't been for that godrotting coward Longstaff , and you , you godrotting pirate , he itched to say . " We merchants think of it , Culum , as a battle , " Struan said ironically . " We dinna understand the difference between an engagement and a battle . We 're just peaceful traders . But the first time the arms of England went against the arms of China deserves the title battle . ' It was just over a year ago . We fired first . " " And what would you have done , Mr. Struan ? It was the correct tactical decision . " " Of course . " " The Captain Superintendent of Trade concurred completely with my actions . " " Of course . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old battles , Captain Glessing ? " Longstaff asked . He was standing at the door of the cabin and had been listening , unnoticed . " No , Your Excellency , just rehashing an old engagement . Mr. Struan and I have never seen eye to eye on Chuenpi , as you know . " " And why should you ? If Mr. Struan had been in your command , his decision might have been the same as yours . If you had been in Mr. Struan 's place , then you might have been sure that they would not have attacked and you would have gambled . " Longstaff yawned and toyed with his watch fob . " What would you have done , Culum ? " " I do n't know , sir . I do n't know the complications that existed . " " Well said . Complications ' is a good word . " Longstaff chuckled . " Would you care to join us , Captain ? A glass of sack ? " " Thank you , sir , but I 'd better get back to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Longstaff motioned the Struans into the conference room which presentlyserved as the private quarters of the Captain Superintendent of Trade . It was spartan and functional , and the deep leather chairs and chart tables , chests of drawers and heavy oak table were all fastened tightly to the deck . The richly carved oak desk was backed by the semicircleof mullioned windows of the stern . The cabin smelled of tar and stale tobacco and sea and , inevitably , gunpowder . TAI-PAN ( 67 ) BOOK I " Steward ! " Longstaff called out . At once the cabin door opened . " Yussir ? " Longstaff turned to Struan . " Sack ? Brandy ? Port ? " " Dry sack , thank you . " " The same , please , sir , " Culum said . " I 'll have port . " Longstaff yawned again . " Yussir . " The steward took the bottles from a sideboard and poured the wines into fine crystal glasses . " Is this your first trip abroad , Culum ? " Longstaff asked . " Yes , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our recent complications ' ? " " No , Your Excellency . Father did n't write very much , and China is n't mentioned in the newspapers . " But it soon will be , eh , Dirk ? " The steward offered the glasses to Longstaff , and then to his guests . " See that we 're not disturbed . " " Yussir . " The steward left the bottles within easy reach and went out . " A toast , " Longstaff said , and Struan remembered Robb 's toast and regrettedthat he had come first to the flagship . " To a pleasant stay , Culum , and to a safe journey home . " They drank . The dry sack was excellent . " History 's being made out here , Culum . And there 's no one better equipped to tell you about it than your father . " " There 's an old Chinese saying , Culum : Truth wears many faces , ' " Struan said . " I do n't understand . " " Just that my version of facts ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him of the previous viceroy , Ling , now in disgrace in Canton , because his policies had precipitated the open conflict with Britain , and presently under a death sentence . " Is that devil Ling still in Canton ? " " I think so . His Excellency Ti-sen smiled when I asked him three days ago and said cryptically , The Vermilion is the Son of Heaven . How can man know what Heaven wills ? ' The Chinese emperor is called the Son of Heaven , " Longstaff elaborated for Culurn 's sake . " The Vermilion ' is anotherof his names because he always writes in vermilion-colored ink . " " Strange , strange people , the Chinese , Culum , " Struan said . " For instance ; only the emperor among three hundred millions is allowed to use vermilion ink . Imagine that . If Queen Victoria said , From now on , only I am allowed to use vermilion , ' as much as we love her , forty thousand Britons would instantly forswear all ink but vermilion . I would mysel ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an unconscious sneer , " would instantly send her a barrel of the color , cash on delivery , and tell Her Britannic Majesty they 'd be glad to supply the Crown , at a price . And they 'd write the letter in vermilion . Rightly so , I suppose . Where would we be without trade ? " There was a small silence and Culum wondered why his father had letTAI-PAN ( 68 ) BOOK Ithe insult pass . Or was it an insult ? Was n't it just another fact of life  --  that aristos always sneered at anyone who was not an aristo ? Well , the Charter would solve aristos once and for all . " You wanted to see me , Will ? " Struan felt deathly tired . His foot ached , and so did his shoulders . " Yes . A few minor things have happened since . . . in the last two days . Culum , would you excuse us for a moment ? I want to talk to your father alone . " " Certainly , sir . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will , " Struan said . But for Longstaff 's sneer he would have let Culum ga . " Culum 's a partner in Struan 's now . One day he 'll rule it as Tai-Pan . You can trust him as you 'd trust me . " Culum wanted to say , " I 'll never be part of this , never . I 've other plans . " But he could say nothing . " I must congratulate you , Culum , " Longstaff said . " To be a partner in The Noble House  --  well , that 's a prize beyond price . " Na when you 're bankrupt , Struan almost added . " Sit down , Culum . " Longstaff paced the room , and began : " A meeting with the ChinesePlenipotentiary is arranged for tomorrow to discuss the treaty details . " " Did he suggest the time and the place , or did you ? " " He did . " " Perhaps you 'd better change it . Pick another place and another time . " " Why ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the mandarins will interpret it as weakness . " " All right . If you think so . The day after tomorrow , what ? At Canton ? " " Yes . Take Horatio and Mauss . I 'll come with you if you like , and we must be four hours late . " " But damme , Dirk , why go to such ridiculous extremes ? Four hours ? ' Pon me word ! " " It 's not ridiculous . By acting like a superior to an inferior , you put them at a disadvantage . " Struan glanced at Culum . " You have to play the Orientalgame by Oriental rules . Little things become very important . His Excellency has a very difficult position here . One little mistake now , and the result will last fifty years . He has to make haste with extreme caution . " " Yes . And no damned help ! " Longstaff drained his glass and poured another . " Why the devil they ca n't act like civilized people I 'll never know . Never . Apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Cabinet at home does n't know the problems I 'm facing and does n't care . I 'm completely on my own here . They give me impossible instructions and expect me to deal with an impossible people . ' Pon me word , we have to be late four hours to prove we 're superior ' when of course everyone knows we 're superior ! " He took some snuff irritably , and sneezed . " When are you holding a land sale , Will ? " " Well , er , I thought when the Cabinet approves the treaty , There 's plenty of time . Say in September , " TAI-PAN ( 69 ) BOOK I " Do you na remember your idea ? I thought you wanted to start building in Hong Kong immediately . " Longstaff tried to recollect . He seemed to remember talking about it to Struan . What was it ? " Well , of course , the ceding of Hong Kong is n't official until both governments approve the treaty  --  I mean , that 's usual , is n't it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual circumstances . " Struan toyed with his glass . " Hong Kong 's ours . The sooner we start building the better , is that na what you said ? " " Well , of course it 's ours . " What was that plan ? Longstaff stifled another yawn . " You said that all land was to belong to the queen . That until you were officially the first governor of Hong Kong , all government was to be in your hands as plenipotentiary . If you issue a special proclamation , then everything is as you planned . If I were you , I 'd hold a land sale next month . Minna forget , Will , that you 'll need revenue for the colony . The Cabinet is sensitive about colonies that dinna pay for themselves . " " Correct . Yes . Absolutely right . Of course . We should begin as soon as possible . We 'll hold the first land sale next month . Let me see . Should it be freehold or on lease , or what ? " " **33;7701;TOOLONG leases . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Longstaff made a helpless gesture . " As if we have n't enough to worry about , Culum ! Now we have to act like damned tradesmen . How the devil do you go about building a colony , what ? Got to have sewers and streets and buildings and God knows what else . A court and a prison , by Jove ! " He paused in front of Culum . " Have you any legal training ? " " No , Your Excellency , " Culum said . " Just half a university degree in the arts . " " No matter . I 'll have to have a colonial secretary , an adjutant general , treasurer and God knows what else . There 'll have to be a police force of some kind . Would you like to be in charge of the police ? " " No , thank you , sir . " Culum tried not to show the shock he felt . " Well , I 'm sure there 's some place we can use you . Everyone 'll have to pitch in . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd like to do and let me know . We 'll need people we can trust . " " Why not put him on your staff as a deputy ? " Struan said . " We 'll lend him to you for six months . " " Excellent . " Longstaff smiled at Culum . " Good . You 're deputy colonial secretary . Let 's see . Make arrangements for the land sale . That 's your first job . " " But I do n't know anything about land sales , sir . I do n't know anything about  --  " " You know as much as anyone , and your father can guide you . You 'll be , er , deputy colonial secretary . Excellent . Now I can forget that problem . TAI-PAN ( 7O ) BOOK IYou find out what should be done and how , and let me know what 's necessary to make it official . Have an auction . That 's the fair way , I imagine . " Longstaff refilled his glass . " Oh , by the way , Dirk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Struan felt his stomach turn over . " Why did you do that , Will ? " " I received a special letter from His Excellency Ti-sen two days ago asking that this be done as an act of good faith . " " You could have waited . " " He wanted an immediate answer , and there was , well  --  no way to reach you . " " Immediate , Chinese style , means anything up to a century . " Oh Willie , you poor fool , he thought , how many times do I have to explain ? Longstaff felt Struan 's eyes grinding into him . " He was sending off a copy of the treaty to the emperor , and wanted to include the fact that we 'd ordered the evacuation . We were going to hand it back anyway , what ? That was the plan . Damme , what difference does it make , now or later ? " " Timing is very important to the Chinese . Has the order gone yet ? " " Yes . It went yesterday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imperial horse relay . I sent the order by that . " Damn your eyes , Struan thought . You impossible fool . " Very bad to use their service for our orders . We 've lost face and they 've gained a point . Nae use in sending a ship now . " His voice was cold and hard . " By the time it got to Chushan the evacuation 'd be completed . Well , it 's done , and that 's that . But it was unwise . The Chinese will only interpret it as weakness . " " I thought the act of good faith a splendid idea , splendid , " Longstaff went on , trying to overcome his nervousness . " After all , we 've everything we want . Their indemnity is light  --  only six million dollars , and that more than covers the cost of the opium they destroyed . Canton is open to trade again . And we have Hong Kong . At long last . " His eyes were sparkling now . " Everything according to plan . Chushan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an expedient . But Hong Kong 's ours . And Ti-sen said he 'd appoint a mandarin for Hong Kong within the month and they 'll  --  " " He 'll what ? " Struan was aghast . " He 'll appoint a mandarin for Hong Kong . What 's the matter ? " Hang on to your temper , Struan warned himself with a mighty effort . You 've been patient all this time . This weak-brained incompetent 's the most necessary tool you have . ' Will , if you allow him to do that , you 're giving him power over Hong Kong . " " Not at all , my dear fellow , what ? Hong Kong 's British . The heathen 'll be under our flag and under our Government . Someone 's got to be in charge of the devils , what ? There 's got to be someone to pay the customs dues to . Where better than Hong Kong ? They 'll have their own customshouseand buildings and  --  " TAI-PAN ( 71 ) BOOK I " They 'll what ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's blood , you have n't agreed to this , I hope ? " " Well , I do n't see anything wrong in it , Dirk , eh ? ' Pon me word , it does n't change anything , does it ? It saves us a lot of trouble . We do n't have to be in Canton . We can do everything from here . " To stop himself from crushing Longstaff like a bedbug , Struan walked over to the bureau and poured himself a brandy . Hold on . Dinna wreck him now . The timing 's wrong . You 've got to use him . " Have you agreed with Ti-sen that he can appoint a mandarin for Hong Kong ? " " Well , my dear fellow , I did n't exactly agree . It 's not part of the treaty . I just said I agreed it seemed a good idea . " " Did you do this in writing ? " " Yes . Yesterday . " Longstaff was bewildered by Struan 's intensity . " But is n't that what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal direct with the mandarins and not through the Chinese hong merchants ? " " Aye . But not on our island , by God ! " Struan kept his voice level , but he was thinking , You godrotting apology for a leader , you stupid aristocratic indecisive wrong-decisioned dungheap . " If we allow that , we sink Hong Kong . We lose everything . " Longstaff tugged at the lobe of his ear , wilting under Struan 's eyes . " Why , Father ? " Culum asked . To Longstaff 's relief , the eyes turned to Culum and he thought , Yes , why ? Why do we lose everything , eh ? I thought it a simply marvelous arrangement . " Because they 're Chinese . " " I do n't understand . " " I know , laddie . " To put away the grief of the loss of his family that suddenly welled up inside him and to take his mind off his frantic worry over the loss of their wealth , he decided to explain  --  as much for Longstaff as for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries the Chinese have called China the Middle Kingdom  --  the land that the gods have placed between heaven above and the earth beneath . By definition a Chinese is a uniquely superior being . They all believe that anyone else  --  anyone  --  is a barbarian and of no account . And that they alone have the God-given right , as the only really civilized nation , to rule the earth . As far as they 're concerned , Queen Victoria is a barbarian vassal who should pay tribute . China has nae fleet , nae army , and we can do what we like with her  --  but they believe they are the most civilized , the most powerful , the richest  --  in this I think they 're potentially right  --  nation on earth . Do you know about the Eight Regulations ? " Culum shook his head . " Well , these were the terms under which the Emperor of China agreed to trade with barbarians ' a hundred and fifty years ago . The Regulations confined all barbarian ' trade to the single port of Canton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in silver , nae credit whatsoever allowed , and smuggling was forbidden . Barbarians ' were allowed to build warehouses andTAI-PAN ( 72 ) BOOK Ifactories on a plot of land half a mile by two hundred yards at Canton ; ' barbarians ' were totally confined to this walled-in area  --  the Canton Settlement  --  andcould stay only for the winter shipping season  --  September until March  --  when they must leave and go to Macao . Nae barbarian ' families were allowed in the Settlement under any circumstance and all women forbidden . Nae arms whatsoever in the Settlement . Learning Chinese , boatingfor pleasure , sedan chairs , and mixing with Chinese were forbidden ; barbarian ' warships were forbidden the Pearl River estuary . All ' barbarian ' merchant ships were to anchor at Whampoa , thirteen miles downstream , where cargoes were to be transshipped and export customs tax paid in silver . All barbarian ' business was to be conducted solely through a monopoly , a guild , of ten Chinese merchants which we call the Co-hong . The Co-hong were also the sole suppliers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of servants and boatmen and compradores . And finally , the one regulation that nailed us to the Cross  --  and the one the treaty cancels  --  specified that the Co-hong were the only recipients of all barbarian ' petitions , requests and complaints , which would then , and solely by them , be forwarded to the mandarins . " The whole point of the Regulations was to keep us at arm 's length , to harass us , yet to squeeze every penny out of us . Remember another thing about the Chinese : They love money . But the squeeze ' benefited only the ruling Manchu class , not all Chinese . The Manchus think our ideas  --  Christianity , Parliament , voting , and above all , equality before the law and a jury system  --  are revolutionary and dangerous and evil . But they want our bullion . " Under the Regulations we were defenseless , our trade was controlled and could be squeezed at will . Even so , we made money . " He smiled . " We made a lot of money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart because of the greed of the officials . The important ones  --  nae warships , nae official contact other than through the Co-hong merchants , nae wives in Canton , nae staying beyond March or before September  --  remained in effect . " And , typically Chinese , the poor Co-hong merchants were made responsiblefor us . Any complication ' and the wrath of the emperor fell on them . Which is again so completely Chinese . The Co-hong were squeezed and are being squeezed until they go bankrupt , most of them . We own six hundred thousand guineas of their worthless paper . Brock has about as much . In Chinese fashion , the Co-hong have to buy their positions from the emperor and they 're expected to continually send huge presents ' to their superiors  --  fifty thousand taels of silver is the customary gift ' on the emperor 's birthday from each of them . " Above the Co-hong is the emperor 's personal squeeze chief . We callhim the Hoppo . He 's responsible for squeezing the mandarins at Canton , the Co-hong , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he 's the biggest trader of opium , by the way , and makes a fortune out of it . " So if you allow one mandarin on Hong Kong , you allow the wholeTAI-PAN ( 73 ) BOOK Isystem . The mandarin will be a Hoppo . Every Chinese will be subject to him . Every Chinese trader who comes to trade will be sold ' licenses and squeezed , and in turn they 'll squeeze us . The Hoppo will destroy those who will help us and help those who hate us . And they 'll never give up until they drive us out . " " Why ? " " Because they 're Chinese . " Struan stretched to ease his shoulders , feeling the tiredness creeping over him , then walked over to the sideboard and poured another brandy . I wish I could be Chinese for an hour or so , he thought wearily . Then I 'd be able to finesse a million taels from somewhere with nae trouble . If that 's the answer , he told himself , then try to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barbarians , ' the mandarin , with unlimited power . What 's the point of power if you dinna use it to twist joss to help yoursel ' ? How can you use your power ? Who has a million taels ? Whom can you pressure to get it ? Who owes you favors ? " What should we do , Dirk ? I mean , I quite agree , " Longstaff said . " You 'd better send Ti-sen an immediate dispatch . Tell him . . no , order him  --  " Struan stopped abruptly as his brain cleared . His fatigue vanished . You 're a stupid , blathering , half-witted Billy ! Ti-sen ! Ti-sen 's your key . One mandarin . That 's all you have to arrange . Two simple steps : First , cancel Longstaff 's agreement as it must be canceled anyway ; second , in a week or two make a secret offer to Ti-sen that in return for a million in bullion you 'll make Longstaff reverse his stand and allow one mandarin into Hong Kong . Ti-sen will leap at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced him to concede ; he 'll squeeze the Co-hong for the million , and they 'll be delighted to pay because they 'll immediately add it onto the cost of the tea they 're dying to sell us and we 're dying to buy . Poor little Willie 's nae problem and none of the other traders will object to one mandarin . We will na call the man " mandarin , " we 'll invent a new name to throw the cleverest off the scent . " Trade commissioner . " The traders will na object to the Chinese " trade commissioner " because he 'll assist trade and simplify the paying of customs . Now , who to make the secret offer ? Obviously old Jin-qua . He 's the richest and the most cunning of the Co-bong and your major supplier , and you 've known him twenty years . He 's the one , wi'out a doubt . One mandarin will guarantee the future of The Noble House . Aye . But he will wreck Hong Kong . And destroy the plan . Do you gamble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to outsmart them later ? That 's a terrible risk  --  you know one mandarin means the whole system . You canna leave that devil legacy for Robb or for Culum or for their children . But wi'out the bullion there 's nae Noble House and nae future . " You were saying , Dirk ? " " Order Ti-sen in the queen 's name to forget a mandarin on Hong Kong . " " My thought entirely . " Longstaff happily sat down at the desk and picked up the quill . " What should I say ? " TAI-PAN ( 74 ) BOOK IAnd what should I do , poor Willie , about the second step ? Struan asked himself . Does the end justify the means ? " Write this : To Ti-sen at Canton . A Special Proclamation : Only Her Britannic Majesty , Queen Victoria , has the authority to appoint officials in the British Island of Hong Kong . There will be no Chinese officials here and no customshouses whatsoever . " He hesitated then continued deliberately , sensing that the timing was right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colony of Hong Kong will henceforth be British subjects and subject only to the laws of England : " " But that exceeds my authority ! " " It 's custom for plenipotentiaries to exceed their authority . That 's why they 're so carefully selected , Will . That 's why we 've an Empire . Raffles , Hastings , Clive , Raleigh , Wellington . You have the plenipotentiary authority of Her Majesty 's Government to arrange a treaty with China . What do they know or care about China at home ? But you 're an innovator , a maker of history , Will . You 're ready to accept one tiny , barren , almost uninhabited island when it 's a world custom to grab whole continents , when you could take all China if you wanted . You 're so much smarter . " Longstaff wavered and sucked the top of the quill . " Yes , but I 've already agreed that Chinese on Hong Kong would be subject to Chinese law , all forms of torture excepted . " A bead of sweat gathered on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treaty and I issued a special proclamation . " " You 've changed your mind , Will . Just as Ti-sen changed his . There was no clause to appoint a mandarin . " " But it was understood . " " Not in your mind . Or mine . He 's trying to dupe you . As he did over Chushan . " " Quite , " Longstaff agreed , happy to be convinced . " You 're right , Dirk . Absolutely . If we allow any control  --  you 're right . They 'll go back to their old devilment , what ? Yes . And it 's time the Chinese saw what justice really is . Law and order . Yes . You 're right . " " End the letter like the emperor would : Fear this and tremblingly obey , ' and sign it with your full title , " Struan said and opened the cabin door . " Master-at-arms ! " " Yes , sirr ? " " His Excellency wants his secretary , Mr. Sinclair , on the double . " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letter . " Is n't this a little blunt , Dirk ? I mean , none of his titles and finishing up like the emperor 's edict ? " " That 's the whole point . You 'll want to publish it in the newspaper . " " But it 's a private document . " " It 's a historic document , Will . One you can be proud of . And one to make the admiral pleased with you . By the way , why was he angry ? " " Oh , the usual . " Longstaff mimicked the admiral . " Goddamme , sir , we were sent out here to fight the heathen , and after two landings with no resistance to speak of , you 've made a contemptible treaty which gets us farTAI-PAN ( 75 ) BOOK Iless than the demands the Foreign Secretary has ordered you to demand . Where are the open ports you were ordered to demand ? ' You 're sure , Dirk , asking less is the correct procedure ? I know you 've said so before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a bad error . No open ports , I mean . " " Hong Kong 's more important , Will . " " So long as you 're sure . The admiral 's also very irritated with some desertionsand , too , with the delay in enforcing the order against smuggling . And , well , there 's been a huge outcry by all the traders . " " Headed by Brock ? " " Yes . Ill-mannered scum . " Struan 's heart sank . " You told the merchants that you were canceling the order ? " " Well , Dirk , I did n't exactly tell them . But I intimated that it would be canceled . " " And you intimated to the admiral that you were canceling the order ? " " Well , I suggested that it was not advisable to proceed . He was most irritated and said that he was making his view known to the Admiralty . " Longstaff sighed and yawned . " ' Pon me word , he has no conception of the problems . None . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade ' to him , what ? I tried , but I could n't get any sense into his head . " And I canna get any into yours , Willie , Struan thought . If Robb 's bought the opium , we 're deeper in the mess . If he has na bought , we 're still finished . Unless a trade  --  one cursed mandarin for one cursed million . " I do n't know what I 'd do without your father 's advice , Culum . " Longstafftook snuff from a jeweled snuff box . Damme , he thought , I 'm a diplomat , not a warmonger . Governor of Hong Kong is just the ticket . Once governor of Hong Kong , then something worthwhile . Bengal , perhaps . Jamaica . .. now , there 's a good place . Canada ? No , too damned cold . Bengal or another of the Indian states . " It 's very complicated in Asia , Culum . I-Iave to deal with so many different views and interests  --  the Crown 's , the traders ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army 's and the Chinese  --  all in conflict . And , damme , the Chinese are splintered into conflicting groups . The merchants , the mandarins and the Manchu overlords . " He filled both nostrils with snuff , sniffed deeply and sneezed . " I suppose you know the rulers of China are n't Chinese ? " " No , sir . " " Half the damned trouble , so we 're told . They 're Manchus . From Manchuria . Wild barbarians from north of the Great Wall . They 've ruled China for two hundred years , so we 're told . - They must think we 're fools . We 're told there 's a huge wall  --  like Hadrian 's Wall  --  a fortification all across the north of China to protect it from the wild tribes . It 's supposed to be over three and a half thousand miles long , forty feet high and thirty feet thick , and wide enough at the top for eight horsemen to ride abreast . There are supposed to be watchtowers every three hundred yards . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two thousand years ago . " He snorted . " Ridiculous ! " TAI-PAN ( 76 ) BOOK I " I believe it exists , " Struan said . " Come now , Dirk , " Longstaff said . " It was impossible to build such a fortification two thousand years ago . " " The legend , Culum , is that every third man in China was conscripted to work on the wall . It was built in ten years . They say a million men died and are buried in the wall . Their spirits guard it , too . " Culum grinned . " If it 's so huge , Father , the Manchus could never have breached it . It ca n't possibly exist . " " The legend is that the Manchus broke through the wall by deceit . The Chinese general in charge of the wall sold out his own people . " " That 's more than likely , " Longstaff said disgustedly . " No sense of honor , these Orientals , what ? The general thought he could usurp the throne by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then destroyed him . In any event , that 's the story . " Culum said , " Quite a story , sir . " Struan 's eyes hardened . " You 'd better get used to many strange stories . And a new thought , Culum  --  the Chinese have had civilization for five thousand years . Books , printing presses , art , poets , government , silk , tea , gunpowder and a thousand other things . For thousands of years . We 've been civilized for five hundred years . If you can call it that . " There was a knock on the door . Horatio hurried in . " You wanted me , Your Excellency ? " " Yes . I want you to translate this immediately into Chinese , and send it off by special courier . And send a copy to Mr. Skinner for publication . " " Yes , sir . " Horatio took the paper and turned to Struan . " I was so sorry to hear the terrible news , Mr. Struan . " " Thank you . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , liking each other instantly . Horatio read the letter . " It will take me a little time to put it in the right court phrases , sir . " " His Excellency wants it sent exactly like that , " Struan said . " Exactly . " Horatio 's mouth dropped open . He nodded feebly . " Yes , I 'll , er , do it at once . But Ti-sen will never accept it , Mr. Struan . Never , Your Excellency . He would lose too much face . " Longstaff bristled . " Face ? I 'll show that devious heathen some face , by God . Give the admiral my compliments and ask him to send the letter by a capital ship of the line to Whampoa , with orders to proceed immediately to Canton if it 's not accepted forthwith ! " " Yes , sir . " " Wo n't accept it , indeed ! " Longstaff said after Horatio had gone . " Damned insolence . They 're all heathen barbarians . All of them . Chinese . Manchus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life is unbelievable . They sell their daughters , sisters , brothers . Unbelievable . " Culum suddenly thought of his mother and brothers , and how they died . The watery vomit and stools , and the stench and cramps and agony and sunken eyes and spasms . And the convulsions and more stench and thenTAI-PAN ( 77 ) BOOK Igasping death . And after death the sudden muscle spasms and his mother , dead an hour but suddenly twisting on the bed , dead eyes open , dead mouth open . The old fear began to sicken him , and he groped for something to think about , anything to make him forget his terror . " About the land sale , sir . First the land should be surveyed . Who 's to do this , sir ? " " We 'll get someone , do n't worry . " " Perhaps Glessing , " Struan said . " He 's had charting experience . " " Good idea . I 'll talk to the admiral . Excellent . " " You might consider naming the beach where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Longstaff was astonished . " I 'll never understand you . Why go out of your way to perpetuate the name of a man who hates you ? " Because good enemies are valuable , Struan thought . And I 've a use for Glessing . He 'll die to protect Glessing 's Point , and that means Hong Kong . " It would please the navy , " Struan said . " Just an idea . " " It 's a good idea . I 'm glad you suggested it . " " Well , I think we 'll get back aboard our ship , " Struan said . He was tired . And there was still much to do . Isaac Perry was on the quarterdeck of Thunder Cloud , watching the marines search under tarpaulins and in the longboats and sail locker . He hated marines and naval officers ; once he had been pressed into the navy . " There 're no deserters aboard , " he said again . " Of course , " the young officer said . " Please order your men not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole watch to clean up after them . " " Your ship 'll make a nice prize , Captain Perry . The ship and the cargo , " the officer sneered . Perry glared at McKay who was by the gangplank , under armed guard . You 're a dead man , McKay , Perry thought , if you 've helped Ramsey aboard . " Longboat on the aft gangway , " the third mate called out . " Owner 's coming aboard . " Perry hurried to meet Struan . " They think we 've a deserter aboard , sir . " " I know , " Struan said as he came on deck . " Why is my bosun under guard ? " he asked the arrogant young officer , a dangerous rasp to his voice . " Just a precaution . He 's a relation of Ramsey and  --  " " A pox on precautions ! He 's innocent until proven guilty , by God , " Struan roared . " You 're here to search , not to harass and arrest my men . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ramsey 's not aboard by my doin ' . He ai n't . He ai n't . " " God help you if he is , " Struan said . " You 're confined to the ship until I order otherwise . Get below ! " TAI-PAN ( 78 ) BOOK I " Yes , son , " McKay said , and fled . " God 's blood , Isaac ! " Struan raged on . " You 're supposed to be captain of this ship . What law says the navy can arrest a man without a warrant as a precaution ? " " None , sir . " Perry quailed and knew better than to argue . " Get to hell off my ship . You 're beached ! " Perry blanched . " But , sir  --  " " Be off my ship by sundown . " Struan moved toward the gangway that led to the bowels of the ship . " Come on , Culum . " Culum caught up with Struan in the passageway to the main cabin . " That 's not fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Captain Perry 's the best captain you have . You 've said so . " " He was , lad , " Struan said . " But he did na watch the interests of his man . And he 's afraid . What of , I dinna ken . But frightened men are dangerous and we 've nae use for such . " " McKay was n't harmed . " " The first law of a captain of mine is to protect his ship . The second , his men . Then they 'll protect him . You can captain a ship alone , but you ca n't run her alone . " " Perry did nothing wrong . " " He allowed the navy to put McKay under guard against the law , by God , " Struan said sharply . " A captain 's got to know more than just how to sail a ship , by God ! Isaac should have stood up to that young puppy . He was afraid , and he failed one of his men when it was important . Next time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But he 's been with you for years . Does n't that count ? " " Yes . It says we were lucky for years . Now I dinna trust him . So now he goes , and that 's the end to it ! " Struan opened the door of the cabin . Robb was seated at the desk , staring out of the stern windows . Boxes and chests and children 's clothes and playthings were strewn on the floor . Sarah , Robb 's wife , was half curled in one of the sea chairs , dozing . She was a small woman , heavy with child , and in sleep her face was lined and tired . When Robb noticed Struan and Culum , he tried unsuccessfully to force a smile . " Hello , Dirk . Culum . " " Hello , Robb . " Struan thought , He 's aged ten years in two days . Sarah awoke with a start . " Hello , Dirk . " She got up heavily and came over to the door . " Hello , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Tired , dear . Very tired . And I hate being on a ship . Would you like some tea ? " " No , thank you . " Robb watched Struan anxiously . " What can I say ? " " Nothing , Robbie . They 're dead and we 're alive and that 's the end to it . " " Is it , Dirk ? " Sarah 's blue eyes were hard . She smoothed her auburn hair and straightened her long , green , bustled dress . " Is it ? " TAI-PAN ( 79 ) BOOK I " Aye . Would you excuse us , Sarah ? I 've got to talk to Robb . " " Yes , of course . " She looked at her husband and despised the weakness of him . " We 're leaving , Dirk . We 're leaving the Orient for good . I 've decided . I 've given Struan and Company five years of my life and one baby . Now it 's time to go . " " I think you 're wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family these days . In a year , when Hong Kong 's built , well , then it 'll be very good . " " For some , perhaps , but not for us . Not for my Roddy or Karen or Naomi or Jamie . Not for me . We 'll never live in Hong Kong . " She was gone . " Did you buy opium , Robb ? " " I bought some . Spent all our cash and borrowed about a hundred thousand  --  I do n't know exactly . Prices did n't come down much . Then , well , I lost interest . " So we 're deeper in the hole , Struan thought . " Why our family ? It 's terrible , terrible , " Robb said , his voice tormented . " Why all our family ? " " Joss . " " Curse joss . " Robb stared at the cabin door . " Brock wants to see you as soon as possible . " " Why ? " " He did n't say . " Struan sat and eased his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he said , " I 've made Culum a partner . " " Good , " Robb said . But his voice was flat . He was still staring at the door . " Father , " Culum broke in , " I want to talk to you about that . " " Later , laddie . Robb , there 's something else . We 've bad trouble on our hands . " " There 's something I must say at once . " Robb tore his eyes off the door . " Dirk , I 'm leaving the Orient with Sarah and the children . By the next boat . " " What ? " " I 'll never be a tai-pan and I do n't want to be . " " You 're leaving because Culum 's a partner ? " " You know me better than that . You might have discussed it with me , yes , but that 's unimportant . I want to leave . " " Why ? " " The deaths at home made me think . Sarah 's right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I want some peace . And there 's more than enough money . You can buy me out . I want to go on the next boat . " " Why ? " " I 'm tired . Tired ! " " You 're just weak , Robb . Sarah 's been on to you again , eh ? " " Yes , I 'm weak , and yes , she 's been on to me again , but I 've decided . Too many deaths . Too many . " TAI-PAN ( 00 ) BOOK I " I canna buy you out . We 're bankrupt . " Struan handed him the bankers ' letter . Robb read the letter . His face aged even more . " God curse them to hell ! " " Aye . But we 're still bankrupt . " Struan pulled on his boot and stood up . " Sorry , Culum , the partnership is worthless . There was a run on our bank . " The air in the cabin seemed to thicken . ' We 've a hundred thousand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of that and you take the rest . " " Thanks , Robbie . Spoken like a man . " Robb slammed the desk with his fist . " It 's not my fault the bank closed its doors ! " " Aye . So dinna ask for half our money when we 'll need every penny ! " " You will , not me . You 'll find the answer , you always have . " " Fifty thousand pounds wo n't last Sarah five years . " " That 's my worry ! The money 's not on the books , so it 's fairly ours . I 'll take half . My share of the business 's worth twenty times that ! " " We 're bankrupt ! Can you na get that through your head ? Bankrupt ! " The cabin door opened and a little golden-haired girl came into the room . A straw doll was in her hands . She wore a frown . " Hello , Daddy . Hello , Uncle Dirk . " She stared up at Struan . " Are I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off Robb . " What , Karen lassie ? " " Are I ugly ? " " No . No . Of course not , Karen . " Struan lifted her up . " Who 's been saying such terrible things to you , lassie ? " " We was playing school on Resting Cloud . It were Lillibet . " " Lillibet Brock ? " " Oh , no . She 's my best friend . It were Lillibet Somebodyelse . " " Well , you 're na ugly . You tell Lillibet Somebodyelse that it 's na nice to say such things . You 're very pretty . " " Oh , good ! " Karen smiled hugely . " My daddy always says I 'm pretty , but I wanted to ask you ' cause you know . You know everything . " She gave him a big hug . " Thank you , Uncle Dirk . Put me down now . " She danced to the door . " I 'm glad I are n't ugly . " Robb slumped in his chair . At length he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry . It 's my fault  --  and I 'm sorry I said . . . sorry .

We 'll send Sarah and the children off by the first ship . The sooner the better , then they 'll miss the typhoon season . " " Maybe I can arrange a loan somehow . We 've got to pay the sight drafts . Well lose the ships  --  everything . " Robb forced his mind away from Sarah . " But how in the little time we have ? " His fingers twisted nervously . " The mail packet came in yesterday . Nothing of importance for us . No news from home . Perhaps others know about the run on our bank . WeTAI-PAN ( 81 ) BOOK Ibought a little stock in Brock 's bank to keep an eye on it . Perhaps he knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to see you ? " " Perhaps . In any case , he 'll be on our necks right smartly , if he finds out . If he did na start it himself ' . He 'll buy up our paper and ruin us . " " Why ? " Culum asked . " Because I 'll ruin him if I get half a chance . " Culum wanted to ask why , and to tell them that he , too , was going home on the next ship . But his father looked so gaunt and Robb was so morose . Tomorrow he would tell him . " I 've got to get a few hours ' sleep , " Struan said . " I 'm going ashore . You and Sarah go back to Resting Cloud , eh ? Perry 's ordered off by sundown . I beached him . " " Who 's going to take his place ? " " I dinna ken , " Struan said as he went out . " Send word to Brock I 'll see him ashore at sundown . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table was untouched . He stared through the tent door at the ships riding at anchor . The sun was dying and a blurred moon was low on the horizon . Huge masses of cumulus dominated the sky . The wind brought the promise of storm . Ti-sen , his mind kept repeating to him . Ti-sen . He 's the only one to save you . Aye , but that 's treachery to all you believe in , all you 've worked for . McKay came in with a lighted lantern and set it on the table . The tent was spacious and comfortable ; there were carpets on the stony soil . " Brock 's longboat 's coming ashore , sorr . " " Take the men and move out of hearing , McKay . " " Yes , sorr . " " Has word come they 've found Ramsey yet ? " " No , sorr , " " ' Where is he ? " " I do n't know , sorr . " Struan nodded absently . " Tomorrow put all our spies to work to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pardon , son , I already spread the word , sorr . " McKay tried to cover his anxiety . " If he 's aboard it 's someone 's devilment . " Then he added , " I feel bad about Cap'n Perry , son . " Struan 's eyes were suddenly hard . " I 'll give you fifteen days to prove I was right about Isaac . Fifteen days , or you 're beached with him . " " Yes , sorr . " McKay felt a barb soar from his testicles into his guts and cursed himself for opening his mouth . Will you never learn , you stupid fool ? Brock 's footsteps were heavy on the beach . He stood at the tent doorway . " Permission to come aboard , Dirk ? " " Aye , Tyler . " McKay went out . Brock sat at the table , and Struan poured him a large brandy . " It were bad to lose yor family . I knowed how it feel . I lost two wives in childbirth , the kids too . Bad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ berth , " Brock said , taking in the tent . " Hungry ? " Struan indicated the food . " Thank you kindly .

" Seems that the joss of The Noble House be runned out . " " Joss ' is a big word . " Brock laughed . " Come now , Dirk . A company be havin ' to have bullion to support its credit . Even Noble House . " " Aye . " " I spend a lot of time , Dirk , and a lot of brass , checking on thee . " Brock picked the other half of the breast off the chicken and devoured it . " You 've a good cook . Tell him I 'll give him a job . " " He likes the one he has . " " No brass , no job , my fine muckel . No bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Brock split another chicken . " Be thee keepin ' the champagne ? This be special occasion , I 'll be bound . " Struan opened the bottle neatly and filled clean glasses for Brock and himself . " Chilled just right , lad . Just right . " Brock smacked his lips . " Twenty-five thousand be no much for a million , be it ? " Struan said nothing . His face was impassive . " Sixpence on the pound , they sayed .

Wi'out the ships you 're lost , laddie . The house , Hong Kong , the plan . Aye , you can start again , but dinna fool yoursel ' . You canna build and man such a fleet again . You 'll never catch up with Brock again . Never . You 'll be second-best . You 'll be second-best forever . Struan felt the veins in his neck throbbing . His throat was parched .

" Good night , laddie . " The coins caught Culum 's eyes , mesmerizing him . He began to pick them up . " I told you to leave them alone ! " " I ca n't .

" CHAPTER 4STRUAN was eating dinner alone in the spacious dining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The vast three-story mansion had been built by the East India Company forty years ago . Struan had always coveted it as a perfect setting for The Noble House . Eight years ago he had bought it . The dining room was on the second floor facing the Pearl River . Below this floor was a labyrinth of offices and warehouses and storerooms . Above were living quarters , and the Tai-Pan 's private rooms , carefully separate . There were courtyards and walks and suites and dormitories within and throughout its length . Forty to fifty Portuguese clerks lived and worked in the building , ten to fifteen Europeans . A hundred Chinese menservants . Women servants were not allowed by Chinese law . Struan pushed his carved chair away from the table and irritably lit a cheroot . A huge fire warmed the marble that sheathed the walls and floor . The table could seat forty and the silver was Georgian , the chandelier crystal and bright with candles . He walked over to a window and looked down at the traders strolling in the garden below . Beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Settlement and adjoined the wharf at the riverbank . The square was , as usual , teemingwith Chinese hawkers , bystanders , sellers and buyers , soothsayers , letter writers , beggars and dogs . Outside their factories it was only in the English Garden , as it was called , that the merchants could move about in relative peace . Chinese , other than servants , were forbidden the garden and the factories . There were thirteen buildings in the colonnaded terrace that ran the length of the Settlement but for two narrow lanes  --  Hog Street and Old China Lane . Only Struan and Brock owned complete buildings . The other traders shared the remainder , taking space to suit their needs , and paid rent to the East India Company , which had built the Settlement a century ago . On the north the Settlement was bounded by Thirteen Factory Street . The walls of Canton City were a quarter of a mile away . Between the city walls and the Settlement was an anthill of houses and hovels . The river was congested with the inevitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the perpetual pulsating , singsong murmur suggesting an enormous beehive . To one side of the garden Struan noticed Brock deep in conversation with Cooper and Tillman . He wondered if they were explaining the inTAI-PAN(89) BOOK Itricacies of the Spanish tea-opium sale to Brock . Good luck to them , he thought without rancor . All is fair in love and trade . " Where the godrotting hell is Jin-qua ? " he said out loud . For twenty-four days Struan had tried to see Jin-qua , but each day his messenger returned to the Settlement with the same reply : " Him no dooa hack all same . You wait can . Tomollow he dooa back to Canton never mind . " Culum had spent ten days in the Canton Settlement with him . On the eleventh day an urgent message had come from Longstaff asking Culum to return to Hong Kong : There were problems about the land sale . Along with Longstaff 's message was a letter from Robb . Robb wrote that Skinner 's editorial about the Struan bankruptcy had provoked consternationamong the traders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through various banks ; that most were waiting for the thirtieth day ; that no credit was to be had , and all the suggestions he had made to Brock 's enemies were fruitless ; that the navy had been incensed when Longstaff 's official negation of the opium-smuggling order was made public , and the admiral had dispatched a frigate home with a request that the Government give him the permission he sought direct ; and last , that Chen Sheng , their compradore , was inundated with creditors demanding payment on all the lesser debts that normally would wait their time . Struan knew that he was beaten if he did not reach Jin-qua in the next six days , and he asked himself again if Jin-qua was avoiding him or if he was truly away from Canton . He 's an old thief , Struan thought , but he 'd never avoid me . And if you do see him , laddie , are you really going to make the offer to that devil Ti-sen ? There was the sound of angry singsong voices and the door burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a servant who was trying to restrain her . The woman wore the usual huge , conical sampan hat and grimy black trousers and blouse and over them a grimy padded jacket . " No stop can this one piece cow chillo , Mass'er , " the servant said in pidgin English , holding on to the struggling girl . Only through pidgin could the traders converse with their servants , and they with them . " Cow " meant " woman . " " Chillo " was a corruption of " child . " " Cow chillo " meant " young woman . " " Cow chillo out ! Plenty quick-quick , savvy ? " Struan said . " You want cow chillo , heya ? Cow chillo plenty good bed jig-jig . Two dollar never mind , " the girl called out . The servant grabbed her and her hat fell off , and Struan saw her face clearly for the first time . She was barely recognizable because of the grime and he collapsed with laughter . The servant gaped at him as though he were mad and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Struan said through his laughter , " Stay can , never mind . " TAI-PAN ( 90 ) BOOK IThe girl tidied her verminous clothes irately and shouted another torrent of invective at the departing servant . " Cow chino plenty good you see , Tai-Pan . " " And you , May-may ! " Struan stared down at her . " What the hell 're you doing here , and what the hell 's the filth for ? " " Cow chino think you dooa jig-jig with new cow chino , heya ? " " God 's blood , lassie , we 're alone now ! Stop using pidgin ! I 've spentenough time and money teaching you the queen 's English ! " Struan liftedher up at arm 's length . " Great God , May-may , you stink to high heaven . " " You would too if you wear these smell clotheses . " " Had to wear these smelly clothes , " he said , correcting her automatically . " What are you doing here , and why the smell clotheses ? " " Put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she bowed sadly . " I arrive here in secret and in great sadness for you lost your Supreme Lady and all children by her but one son , " The tears streaked the grime on her face . " Sorry , sorry . " ' " Thank you , lass . Aye . But that 's done now , and no grief can bring them back . " He patted her head and fondled her cheek , touched by her compassion . " I do not know your custom . How long should I dress in mourning ? " " No mourning , May-may . They 're gone . There 's to be no weeping and no mourning . " " I burned incense for their safe rebirth . " " Thank you . Now , what are you doing here , and why did you leave Macao ? I told you to stay there . " " First bath , then change , then talk . " " We 've no clothes here , May-may . " " My worthless amah , Ah Gip , is downstair . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is bath ? " Struan pulled the bell cord and immediately the wide-eyed servant appeared . " Cow chino my bath , savvy ? Arnah can dooa . Get chow ! " Then to Maymay , " You say what chow can . " May-may chattered at the gaping servant imperiously , and left . Her peculiar swaying gait never failed to move Struan . May-may had bound feet . They were only three inches long . When Struan had bought her five years ago he had cut off the bandages and been horrified at the deformity that ancient customs had decreed was a girl 's essential sign of beauty  --  tiny feet . Only a girl with bound feet  --  lotus feet  --  could be a wife or concubine . Those with normal feet were peasants , servants , low-class prostitutes , amahs or workers , and despised . May-may 's feet were crippled . Without the binding tightness of the bandages her agony had been pitiful . So Struan had allowed the bandagesto be replaced , and after a month the pain had lessened and May-may could walk again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pain . TAI-PAN ( 91 ) BOOK IStruan had asked her then , using Gordon Chen as interpreter , how it was done . She had told him proudly that her mother had begun to bind her feet when she was six . " The bindings were bandages two inches wide and twelve feet long and they were damp . My mother wrapped them tightly around my feet  --  around the heel and over the instep and under the foot , bending the four small toes under the sole of the foot and leaving the big toe free . As the bandages dried they tightened and the pain was terrible . Over the months and years the heel closes near to the toe and the instep arches . Once a week the bandages are taken off for a few minutes and the feet cleaned . After some years the little toes become shriveled and dead and are removed . When I was almost twelve I could walk quite well , but my feet were still not small enough . It was then that my mother consulted a woman wise in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wise woman came to our house with a sharp knife and ointments . She made a deep knife cut across the middle of the soles of my feet . This deep split allowed the heel to be squeezed closer to the toes , when the bandages were replaced . " " What cruelty ! Ask her how she stood the pain . " Struan remembered her quizzical look as Chen translated the question and as she replied in charming singsong . " She says , For every pair of bound feet there is a lake of tears . But what are tears and pain ? Now I am not ashamed to let anyone measure my feet . ' She wants you to measure them , Mr. Struan . " " I will na do such a thing ! " " Please , sir . It will make her very proud . They are perfect , in Chinese fashion . If you do n't , she will feel that you 're ashamed of her . She will lose face terribly in front of you . " " Why ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was cheating you . " " Why should I think that ? " " Because you 're  --  well , she 's never known a European . Please , sir . It is only your pride in her that repays all the tears . " So he had measured her feet and expressed the joy that he did not feel , and she kowtowed three times to him . He hated to see men and women kowtowing , kneeling , their foreheads touching the floor . But ancient customdemanded this obeisance from an inferior to a superior and Struan could not forbid it . If he protested , May-may would be frightened again and she would lose face in front of Gordon Chen . " Ask her if her feet hurt her now . " " They will always hurt her , sir . But I assure you it would pain her much more if she had big , disgusting feet . " May-may then had said something to Chen , and Struan recognized the word fan-quai , which meant " devil barbarian . " " She wants to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tell her fan-quai are no different from Chinese . " TAI-PAN ( 92 ) BOOK I " Yes , sir . " " And tell her that you are going to teach her English . Immediately . Tell her no one 's to know you 're teaching her . No one 's to know she can speak English . In front of others she 's to speak Chinese only , or pidgin , which you 'll also teach her . Lastly , you will protect her with your life . " " May I come in now ? " May-may was standing in the doorway , bowing delicately . " Please . " Her face was oval , her eyes almond-shaped and her eyebrows perfect crescents . A perfume surrounded her now , and her long , flowing robe was of the finest blue silk brocade . Her hair was dressed in crescents on the top of her head and adorned with jade pins . She was tall for a Chinese and her skin so white as to be almost translucent . She was from the provinceof Soochow . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks over the price , he knew that actually T'chung May-may was Jinqua'sgift to him in return for many favors over the years ; that Jin-qua could have sold her easily to the richest man in China , to a Manchu prince , even to the emperor , for her weight in jade  --  let alone the fifteen thousand taels of silver which they finally agreed on . She was unique , and priceless . Struan lifted her up and kissed her gently . " Now , tell me what 's going on . " He sat in the deep chair and held her in his arms . " First , I came disguise because of danger . Na only to me but to you . The reward still is on your head . And kidnaping for ransom is ancient custom . " " Where did you leave the children ? " " With Elder Sister , of course , " she replied . Elder Sister was what Maymaycalled Struan 's ex-mistress Kai-sung , as was the custom , though they were not related . And now Kai-sung was the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kai-sung there was intense affection , and Struan knew that the children would be safe and cherished as if they were her own . " Good , " he said . " How are they ? " " Duncan has the black eye . He tripped down , so I whipped his turtledungamah till my arm she fell off . Duncan has a bad temper from barbarianblood . " " From you  --  na from me . Kate ? " " She has her second tooth . That very lucky . Before second birthday . " She nestled in his arms a moment . " Then I read paper . That man Skinner . More bad joss , heya ? That lump of dogmeat Brock is breaking you by huge monies owed . Is it true ? " " Part 's true . Aye , unless there 's a change in joss , we 're broke . No more silk and perfumes and jades and houses , " he teased . TAI-PAN ( 93 ) BOOR I " Ayeeeee yah ! " she said with a toss of her head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He slapped her on the rump and she hacked at him with her long nails , and he caught her wrist neatly . " Dinna say that again , " he said , and kissed her passionately . " God 's blood , " she said , trying to catch her breath . " Now look wat you 've done to my hair . That lazy whore Ah Gip spent one hour doing it , never mind . " She knew that she pleased him greatly , and she was proud that she could now , at twenty , read and write English and Chinese , and speak English and Cantonese as well as her own dialect of Soochow , and also Mandarin , the language of Peking and the court of the emperor ; and also that she knew much of what Gordon Chen had learned at school for he had taught her well , and between them was great affection . May-may knew that she was unique in all China . There was a discreet knock on the door . " A European ? " she whispered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 've orders to announce everyone . Aye ? " The servant was followed by two others and they all averted their eyes from Struan and the girl . But their curiosity was obvious , and they dawdledover laying out the dishes of Chinese food and chopsticks . May-may assaulted them with a torrent of Cantonese and they bowed nervously and scuttled away . " What did you say to them ? " Struan asked . " I just warned them , by God , if they told anyone I was here I 'd personallyslit their tongues and cut their ears off and then I 'd persuade you to chain them in one of your ships and sink it in the ocean along with their godrotting wives and children and parents , and before that you 'd put your Evil Eye on the godrotting scum and their godrotting scum offspring forever.  --  " Stop cursing , you bloodthirsty little devil ! And stop joking about Evil Eye . " " That 's no joke . That 's what you have , devil barbarian . To all but me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , May-may . " He intercepted her hands and the intimate caress . " Eat while the food 's hot and I 'll deal with you later . " He picked her up and carried her over to the table . She served him quick-fried shrimps and lean pork and mushrooms stewed delicately in soya and nutmeg and mustard and honey , then helped herself . " God 's death , I 'm hungry , " she said . " Will you na stop swearing ! " " You forgot the by God , ' Tai-Pan ! " She beamed and began to eat with great relish . He picked up the chopsticks and used them deftly . He found the foodTAI-PAN ( Coq . ) BOOK Isuperb . It had taken him months to acquire the taste . None of the Europeansate Chinese food . Struan , too , had once preferred the solid fare of old England , but May-may had taught him that it was healthier to eat as the Chinese did . " How did you get here ? " Struan asked . May-may selected one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in soya-flavored syrup and herbs , and daintily she decapitated it and began to peel off the skin . " I bought passage on a lorcha . I buy fantasticalcheap steerage ticket and dirtied myself for safety . You owe me fifty cash . " " Pay it out of your allowance . I did na ask you here . " " This cow chillo dooa cash easy can , never mind . " " Stop it and behave yoursel ' . " She laughed and offered him the prawn and began to peel another . " Thanks , no more for me . " " Eat them . They 're very good for you . I tell you many times they make you very healthy and very potent . " " Give over , lass . " " They do , " she said , very serious . " Prawns are very good for your vigor . Very important to have plenty of vigor ! A wife must look after her husband . " She cleaned her fingers on an embroidered napkin , then picked up one of the prawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you have to eat the heads ? " " Aye , by God , do you na ken they 're the best part ? " she said , mimicking him , and laughed so much she choked . He thumped her on the back , but gently , and then she drank some tea . " That 'll teach you , " he said . " The heads are the best part , even so , never mind . " " Even so , they look dreadful , never mind . " She ate in silence a moment . " It is bad with Brock ? " " Bad . " " It is terrifical simple to solve this badness . Kill Brock . It is time now . " " That 's one way . " " One way , another way , you will find a way . " " What makes you so sure ? " " You do not want to lose me . " " Why should I lose you ? " " I dinna enjoy second-best either . I belong to the Tai-Pan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cantonese whore . Tea ? " " Aye . " " Drinking tea with food is very good for you . Then you will never get fat . " She poured the tea and offered him the cup gracefully . " I like you when you 're angry , Tai-Pan . But you dinna frighten me . I know I please you too much , as you please me too much . When I am second-best another will take my place , never mind . That is joss . For me . And also for you . " " Perhaps you 're second-best now , May-may . " TAI-PAN ( 95 ) BOOK I " No , Tai-Pan , not now . Later , yes , but not now . " She bent over him and kissed him and slid away as he tried to hold her . " Ayee yah , I must not feed you so many prawns !

" " But that is too much gamble ! " She saw the mocking challenge in his face , and her eyes flashed . " Four games . I beat you , by God . " " Oh no , by God ! " So they played four games and she cursed and cheered and wept and laughed and gasped , consumed with excitement as her fortunes changed . She lost eighteen thousand dollars . " God 's death , I 'm ruined , Tai-Pan . Ruined . Oh woe , woe , woe . All my savings and more . My house  --  One more game , " she begged . " You must let me try to get back monies . " " Tomorrow . Same stakes . " " Never will I gamble again for such stakes . Never , never , never . Except one more time tomorrow . " After they had made love , May-may got out of the four-poster bed and went to the fireplace . An iron kettle hissed softly on the little iron shelf near the flames . She knelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clean white towels . The flames danced over the purity of her body . Her feet were encased in tiny sleeping shoes and the bindings were neat around her ankles . Her legs were long and beautiful . She brushed the shiny blueblacknessof her hair behind her and came back to the bed . Struan held out his hand for one of the towels . " No , " May-may said . " Let me . It gives me pleasure and it is my duty . " TAI-PAN ( 96 ) BOOK IWhen she had dried him she washed herself and then settled peacefully beside him under the quilts . A crisp wind rustled the damask curtains and made the flames in the grate hiss . Shadows danced on the walls and high ceiling . " Look , there 's a dragon , " May-may said . " No . It 's a ship . Are you warm enough ? " " Always , near you . There 's a pagoda . " " Aye . " He put an arm around her , glorying in the smooth coolness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Good . Tea will be very good . " After the tea they were refreshed , and they lay back in the bed and he blew out the lamp . They watched the shadows again . " Your custom is that you may only have one wife , heya ? " " Aye . " " Chinese custom is better . Tai-tai is more wise . " " What 's that , lassie ? " " Supreme of the Supreme . ' The husband is supreme in family , of course , but in the home , first wife is supreme of supreme . It is Chinese law . Many wives is also law but one Tai-tai .

Struan watched the shadows a long time . Then he slept . Just after dawn he awoke , sensing danger . Taking his knife from under the pillow , he walked softly to the window and pulled the curtains aside . To his astonishment he saw that the square was deserted . Beyond the square , in the river , an uneasy silence seemed to hang over the floating villages . Then he heard muffled footsteps padding toward the room . He glanced at May-may . She still slept peacefully . With his knife ready , Struan leaned against the wall behind the door and waited . The footsteps ceased . A gentle knock . " Aye ? " The servant came softly into the room . He was frightened , and when he saw Struan naked , the knife in his hand , he gasped out , " Mass'er ! HooknoseMass'er and Black Hair Mass'er dooa here . Say quick-quick plees can . " Say I quick-quick dooa . " Struan dressed quickly . He dropped a hairbrush and May-may halfTAI-PAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get up . Come back to bed , " she said sleepily , and curled deeper into the quilts and was instantly asleep again . Struan opened the door . Ah Gip was squatting patiently in the corridor , where she had slept . Struan had given up trying to make her sleep elsewherefor Ah Gip would smile and nod and say , " Yes , Mass'er , " and still sleep outside the door . She was short and square and a smile seemed to be permanently fixed on her round , pockmarked face . For three years she had been May-may 's personal slave . Struan had paid three taels of silver for her . He beckoned her into the room . " Missee dooa sleep can . Waitee this piece room , savvy ? " " Savvy , Mass'er . " He hurried downstairs . Cooper and Wolfgang Mauss were waiting for him in the dining room . Mauss was moodily checking his pistols . " Sorry to disturb you , Tai-Pan . There 's trouble , " Cooper said . " What ? " " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bannermen  --  cameinto Canton last night . " " Are you sure ? " " No , " Cooper said . " But if it is true , there 's going to be trouble . " " How-qua sent for me this morning , " Mauss said heavily . " Did he say if Jin-qua was back yet ? " " No , Tai-Pan . He still says his father 's away . For myself , I do not think so , heirs ? How-qua was very afraid . He said that he 'd been awoken early this morning . An imperial edict signed by the emperor was given him which said that all trade with us was to cease instantly . I read it . The seals were correct . The whole Co-hong 's in an uproar . " There was a clattering in the square . They hurried over to the window . Below them a company of mounted Manchu soldiers trotted into the east end and dismounted . They were big men and heavily armed  --  muskets , long bows , swords and bannered lances . Some were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops and carried the imperialbanners . Chinese were not allowed into their regiments ; they were the elite of the emperor 's army . " Well , there are certainly forty or fifty in Canton , " Struan said . " And if there are two thousand ? " Cooper asked . " We 'd better get ready to leave the Settlement . " " Banne , Yuen are a bad sign , " Mauss said . He did not want to leave the Settlement ; he wished to stay with his Chinese converts and to continue the preaching to the heathen that took all of his time when he was not interpreting for Struan . " Schrechlich bad . " Struan considered possibilities , then rang for a servant . " Big chow quickquick . Coffee  --  tea  --  eggs  --  meat  --  quick-quick ! " " Bannermen are in the square , and all you think of is having breakfast ? " Cooper asked . TAI-PAN ( 98 ) BOOK I " No point in worrying on an empty stomach , " Struan said . " I 'm hungry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whispered rumor among the servants that the Tai-Pan 's legendary mistress had arrived in secret . At Struan 's suggestion , two years ago he had secretly taught May-may Christianity and had converted her . Yes , he thought proudly , the Tai-Pan trusts me . Because of him , oh Lord , one at least has been saved . Because of him , others are being saved for Thy divine mercy . " Breakfast is a good idea . " Standing beside the window , Cooper could see the traders scurrying through the garden and into their factories . The bannermen were grouped in an untidy mass , squatting and chattering . " Maybe it 'll be like the last time . The mandarins 'll hold us for ransom , " Cooper said . " Na this time , laddie . If they start anything , they 'll try to cut us up first . " ' Why ? ' " Why send bannermen to Canton ? They 're fighting men  --  na like the local Chinese army . " Servants came in and began to lay the huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold chickens and boiled eggs and loaves of bread and hot stew and dumplings and hot meat pies and butter , marmalade and jam . Struan ate heartily and so did Mauss . But Cooper had no relish for his food . " Mass'er ? " a servant said . " Aye ? " " One-Eye Mass'er dooa here . Can ? " " Can . " Brock stalked into the room . His son Gorth was with him . " Morning , gentlemen . Morning , Dirk lad . " " Breakfast ? " " Thank you kindly . " " You had a good voyage , Gorth ? " " Yes , thank you , Mr. Struan . " Gorth was of a size with his father , a hard man , scarred and broken-nosed , with grizzled hair and beard . " Next time I be beating Thunder Cloud . " " Next time , lad , " Brock said with a laugh , " you be captaining her . " He sat and began to gorge himself . " Will thee pass the stew , Mr. Cooper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Them bastards doan mean no good . " " Aye . What do you think , Brock ? " Struan asked . " The Co-hong be tearing their pigtails out . So trade be finished for the time . First time I seed poxy bannermen . " " Evacuate the Settlement ? " " I baint bein ' chased out by Chinee or by bannermen . " Brock helped himself to more stew . " Course I may retreat a little . In me own time . Most of us'n be starting back tomorrer for the land sale . But we 'd do good to call a council right smartly . You 've arms here ? " " Na enough . " TAI-PAN ( 99 ) BOOK I " We 've plenty for a siege . Gorth bringed ' em . This place be the best to defend . It be almost ourn anyway They 'll take on a hundred Chinese apiece . " " I 've thirty , counting the Portuguese . " " Forget the Portuguese . Better us'n alone . " Brock wiped his mouth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butter and marmalade . " You ca n't defend the Settlement , Brock , " Cooper said . " We can defend this factory , lad . Doan thee worry about us'n . You and the rest of the Americans hole up in yorn . They wo n't touch thee  --  it 's us'n they want after . " " Aye , " Struan said . " And we 'll need you to watch our trade if we have to leave . " " That be another reason I come here , Dirk . Wanted to talk open about trade and Cooper-Tillman . I made a proposal which were accepted . " " The proposal was accepted subject to Struan and Company 's not being able to fulfill prior arrangements , " Cooper said . " We 're giving you thirty days , Dirk . On top of the thirty days . " " Thank you , Jeff . That 's generous . " " That be stupid , lad . But I doan mind the time , I be generous too with yor time . Five more days , Dirk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go back to the Co-hong and find out what you can . Be careful and take one of my men . " " I do n't need a man with me . " Mauss heaved his girth out of the chair and left . " We 'll hold the council downstairs , " Struan said . " Good . Perhaps we should all move in here . There be space enough . " " That would give us away . Better to prepare and wait . It may just be a trick . " " Right thee are , lad . We be safe enough till servants disappear . Come on , Gorth . Conference in an hour ? Downstairs ? " " Aye . " Brock and Gorth left . Cooper broke a silence . " What does it all mean ? " " I think it 's a ploy by Ti-sen to make us nervous . To prepare for some concessions he wants . " Struan laid a hand on Cooper 's shoulder . " Thanks for the thirty days . I will na forget . " " Moses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you . " The conference was noisy and angry , but Brock and Struan dominated it . All the traders  --  with the exception of the Americans  --  were in the huge state room that Struan used as his private office . Kegs of cognac , whisky , rum , and beer lined one wall . Tiers of books and ledgers lined another . Quance paintings hung on the walls  --  landscapes of Macao , portraits , and ships . Glass-fronted chests with pewter mugs and silver tankards . And racks of cutlasses , and muskets ; powder and shot . TAI-PAN ( I00 ) BOOK I " It 's nothing , I tell you , " Masterson snorted . He was a red-faced , dewlappedman in his early thirties , head of the firm of Masterson , Roach and Roach . He was dressed like the other men  --  dark wool broadcloth frock coat , resplendent waistcoat and felt top hat . " The Chinese have never molested the Settlement ever since there was one here , by God . " " Aye . But that was before we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Struan wished they would all agree and go . He held a perfumed handkerchiefover his nose against the rancid stench of their bodies . " I say toss the bloody bannermen out of the square right now , " Gorth said , refilling his tankard with beer . " We be doing that if it be necessary . " Brock spat into the pewter spittoon . " I be tired of all this talkin ' . Now be we agreeing with Dirk 's plan or baint we ? " He glared around the room . Most of the traders glared back . There were forty of them  --  English and Scots , except for Eliksen the Dane , who factored for a London firm , and a corpulent Parsee dressed in flowing robes , Rumajee , from India . MacDonald , Kerney , Maltby from Glasgow and Messer , Vivien , Tobe , Smith of London were the chief traders , all tough , oak-hard men in their thirties . " I sniff troubles , sir , " Rumajee said and pulled at his vast mustache . " I counsel immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole point of the plan , Rumajee , is not to retreat , " Roach said caustically . " To retreat only if necessary . I vote for the plan . And I agree with Mr. Brock . Too much bloody talking and I 'm tired . " Struan 's plan was simple . They would all wait in their own factories ; if trouble began , on a signal from Struan , they would converge on his factory under covering fire from his men if necessary . " Retreat before the heathen ? Never , by God ! " " May I suggest something , Mr. Struan ? " Eliksen asked . Struan nodded at the tall , fair-haired , taciturn man . " Of course . " " Perhaps one of us should volunteer to take word to Whampoa . From there a fast lorcha could hare for the fleet at Hong Kong . Just in case they surround us and cut us off as before . " " Good idea , " Vivien said . He was tall , pallid and very drunk . " Let 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good chap . " Then all at once they were talking again and quarreling about who should volunteer , and at length Struan pacified them . " It was Mr. Eliksen'ssuggestion . If he 's a mind to , why na let him have the honor ? " They trooped into the garden and watched as Struan and Brock escorted Eliksen across the square to the lorcha Struan had put at his disposal . The bannermen paid no attention to them , other than to point and jeer . The lorcha headed downstream . " Mayhaps we be never seeing him again , " Brock said . " I dinna think they 'll touch him or I 'd never 've let him go . " TAI-PAN ( IOI ) BOOK IBrock grunted . " For a foreigner , he baint a bad ' un . " He went back with Gorth to his own factory . The other traders streamed to theirs . When Struan was satisfied with the arrangement of the armed watch in the garden , and at the back door that let onto Hog Street , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah Gip . " Where Missee ? " " Doan knowa , Mass'er . Cow chillo no see my . " He searched the whole building , but they had vanished . It was almost as though they had never been there . CHAPTER 5STRUAN was in the garden . It was just before midnight . There was an uneasy stillness in the air . He knew that most of the traders would be sleeping in their clothes , weapons beside them . He peered through the gate at the bannermen . Some were sleeping ; others were jabbering over a fire that they had built in the square . The night was chill . There was scant movement on the river . Struan left the gate and sauntered pensively around the garden . Where the devil was May-may ? He knew that she would not casually leave the Settlement . Perhaps she had been enticed away . Perhaps  --  God 's blood , that was nae way to think . But he knew that the richest warlord in China would not hesitate to take her  --  by force if necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the side wall and Struan 's knife was instantly in his hand . It was a Chinese who tremulously held out a piece of paper . He was a short , lithe man with broken teeth , his face stretched and opium-yellowed . Imprinted on the paper was Jin-qua 's chop , a private seal used only on contracts and special documents . " Mass'er , " the Chinese said softly . " Dooa follow . Alone . " Struan hesitated . It was dangerous to leave the protection of the Settlementand his men . Foolhardy . " No can . Jin-qua here can . " " No can . Dooa follow . " The Chinese pointed at the chop . " Jin-qua wantshee , quick-quick . " " Tomollow , " Struan said . The Chinese shook his head . " Now . Quick-quick , savvy ? " Struan realized that possibly Jin-qua 's chop had fallen into other hands and that this could easily be a trap . But he dared not take Mauss or any of his men because the meeting must be very secret . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lantern and made absolutely sure that the chop was correct . He nodded . " Can . " The Chinese led the way to the side wall and clambered over it . Struan followed , ready for treachery . The Chinese hurried along the side wall of the factory and turned into Hog Street . Incredibly , the street was deserted . But Struan could feel eyes watching him . At the end of Hog Street the Chinese turned east . There were twoTAI-PAN ( I03 ) BOOK Icurtained sedan chairs waiting . The sedan-chair coolies were terrified . Their fear intensified when they saw Struan . Struan got into one sedan chair , the Chinese into the other . Immediatelythe coolies picked up the chairs and loped along Thirteen Factory Street . They turned south into narrow , deserted alleyways unfamiliar to Sudan . Soon he had lost all sense of direction . He settled back and cursed his stupidity , at the same time exulting in the expectation of danger . At length the coolies stopped in a filthy , high-walled alley strewn with rotting offal . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some money and when they had evaporatedinto the darkness , he knocked on a door . It opened , and he stepped aside for Struan to enter . Struan motioned him to go first , then warily followed him into a rancid stable where another Chinese was waiting with a lantern . This man turned and walked silently across the stable through another door and did not look behind him . Now they picked their way through a huge warehouse and up rickety steps and down more steps into another warehouse . Rats scurried in the darkness . Struan knew they were somewhere near the river for he could hear water lapping and hawsers creeking . He was ready for an instant fight , the haft of his knife in his cupped hand , the blade concealed up his sleeve . The man with the lantern ducked under a bridge of packing cases and led the way to another half-hidden door . He knocked and then opened the door . " Halloa , Tai-Pan , " Jin-qua said . " All same no see a longa time . " Struan came into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with candles and cluttered with packing cases and mildewed fishing nets . " Halloa , Jin-qua , " he said , relieved . " No see a longa time . " Jin-qua was ancient , fragile , tiny . His skin was like parchment . Thin wisps of graying beard fell to his chest . His robes were richly brocaded , and his hat jeweled . He wore thick-soled embroidered shoes and his queue was long and shiny . The nails of his little fingers were protected by jeweled sheaths . Jin-qua nodded happily and shuffled to a corner of the warehouse and sat at a table set with food and tea . Struan sat opposite him , his back to the wall . Jin-qua smiled . He had only three teeth . They were gold-capped . Jin-qua said something in Chineseto the man who had brought Struan , and the man left by another door . " Tea-ah ? " Jin-qua asked . " Can . " Jin-qua nodded to the servant who had carried the lantern , and he poured the tea and helped Jin-qua and Struan to some food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Struan noticed that the man was muscular and armed with a knife at his belt . " Flees , " Jin-qua said , motioning Struan to eat . " Thank you . " TAI-PAN ( I04 ) BOOK IStruan nibbled at his food and drank some tea and waited . It was necessary to let Jin-qua make the first opening . After they had eaten in silence , Jin-qua said , " You want see my ? " " Jin-qua dooa good trade out of Canton ? " " Bis'ness good bad all same , never mind . " " Trade stoppee now ? " " Stoppee now . Hoppo very bad mandarin . Sodjers many , many . My payee big squeeze for sodjers . Ayee yah ! " " Bad . " Struan sipped his tea . Now or never , he told himself . And now that the right moment had at last arrived , he knew that he could never sell out Hong Kong . A pox on the mandarin ! While I 'm alive there 'll be nae godrotting mandarin on Hong Kong . It 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to solve bankruptcy . So Brock 's safe , because everyone expects me to remedy the problem that way . Or is he safe ? Where the hell 's May-may ? " Hear One-Eye Devil Brock have Tai-Pan by troat . " " Hear Devil Hoppo have Co-hong by troat , " Struan said . Now that he had decided not to make a deal , he felt much better . " Ayee yah ! " " All same . Mandarin Ti-sen anger-anger have got . " " Why so ? " " Mass'er Odious Penis ' writee werry bad-bad letter . " " Tea-ah werry number-one good-ah , " Struan said .

" Hear Jin-qua have got new bull chillo . What number son this ? " " Ten and seven , " Jin-qua said , beaming . Great God , Struan thought . Seventeen sons  --  and probably the sameTAI-PAN ( I05 ) BOOK Inumber of daughters , which Jin-qua @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in appreciation . Jin-qua laughed . " How muchee tea-ah wantshee this season ? " " Trade stop . How can trade ? " Jin-qua winked . " Can . " " Doan knowa . You sell Brock . When I wantshee tea-ah I tell you , heya ? " " Must knowa two days . " " No can . " Jin-qua said something sharply to his servant , who went to one of the mildewed packing cases and removed the lid . It was full of silver bullion . Jin-qua motioned at the other packing case . " Here forty lac dolla . " A lac was approximately twenty-five thousand pounds sterling . Forty lacs was a million sterling . Jin-qua 's eyes slitted even more . " I borrow . Werry hard . Werry expensee . You want ? Jin-qua lend , maybe . " Struan tried to conceal his shock . He knew there would be a hard deal attached to any loan . He knew that Jin-qua must have gambled his life and his soul and his house and his future and that of his friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bullion had to be secret or the Hoppo would have stolen it and Jin-qua simply would have disappeared . If news leaked into the pirate and bandit nests that abounded in or near Canton that there was even a hundredth part of so much treasureclose at hand , Jin-qua would have been obliterated . " Many lac dolla , " Struan said . " Man dooa fav'r must return fav'r . " " Buy this year double tea-ah last year , same price last year . Can ? " " Can . " " Sell double opium this year same price last year . Can ? " " Can . " Struan would pay over market price for the tea and would have to sell the opium at less than the present market price , but he would still make a vast profit . If the other conditions are possible , he reminded himself . Perhaps he was not finished after all . If Jin-qua did not want the mandarin . Struan said a silent prayer that a mandarin was not part of the deal . But he knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no Co-hong . And if there was no Co-hong and no monopoly , Jin-qua and all the other merchants would be out of business . They had to have the system too . " Only buy Jin-qua or Jin-qua son ten year . Can ? " Great God , Struan thought , if I give him a monopoly on the house , he can squeeze us at will . " Can  --  when tea price , silk price all same other Co-hong . " " Twenty year .

" Suppose no Jinqua , no Jin-qua son ? " " Plenty son  --  plenty son of son . Can ? " " New ten year add four p'cent . " " Five . " " Four . " " Bad , bad . Werry high interest , werry . Five . " Struan kept his eyes off the bullion but could feel it surrounding him . Dinna be a fool . Take it . Agree to anything . You 're safe , laddie . You 've everything . " Mandarin Ti-sen say one mandarin Hong Kong , " Jin-qua said abruptly . " Why you say no ? " " Jin-qua doan like mandarin , heya ? What for I like mandarin , heya ? " Struan replied , a knot in his stomach . " Forty lac dolla , one mandarin . Can ? " " No can . " " Plenty easy . Why for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can . " Struan 's eyes never wavered . " Mandarin no can . " " Forty lac dolla . One mandarin . Cheep . " " Forty times ten lac dolla no can . Die first . " Struan decided to bring the bargaining to an end . " Finish , " he said harshly . " By my fathers , finish . " He got up and walked for the door . " Why for goa ? " Jin-qua asked . " No mandarin  --  no dolla . Why talk , heya ? " To Struan 's astonishment Jin-qua cackled and said , " Ti-sen want mandarin . Jin-qua no lend money belong Ti-sen . Jin-qua lend Jin-qua money . Add new ten year five p'cent . Can ? " " Can . " Struan sat down again , his head dizzy . " Five lac dolla buy Jin-qua land in Hong Kong . Can ? " Why ? Struan asked himself helplessly . If Jin-qua lends me the money , he must know that the Co-hong 's finished . Why should he destroy himself ? Why buy land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " Can . " " Five lac dolla keep safe . " Jin-qua opened a small teak box and took out two chops . The chops were small square sticks of ivory two inches long . The old man deftly held them together and dipped the ends , which were intricately carved , into the solid ink and made a chop mark on a sheet ofTAI-PAN ( I07 ) BOOK Ipaper . Jin-qua gave Struan one of the chops and put the other back in the box . " Man bring this piece chop , give land and dolla , five lac , savvy ? " " Savv " Y  --  " Nex ' year I send one my bull chino Hong Kong . You send all same your son school Lond'n . Can ? " " Can . " " Your bull chill() , Gord'n Chen . Good ? Bad maybe ? " " Good chillo . Chen Sheng say plenty good think-think . " Obviously Struan was supposed to do something with Gordon Chen . But why and how did Gordon fit into Jin-qua 's machinations ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What for bigger job ? " Jin-qua said contemptuously . " Think you lend one lac dolla Chen bull chillo . " " What inter'st ? " " Half profit . " Profit on what ? Struan felt that Jin-qua was playing him like a fish . But you 're off the hook , laddie , he wanted to shout . You 'll get the bullion wi'out the mandarin . " Can . " Jin-qua sighed and Struan assumed that the deal was concluded . But it was not . Jin-qua put his hand into his sleeve pocket and brought out eight coin halves and put them on the table . Each of four coins had been crudely broken in two . With one of his fingernail protectors Jin-qua pushed a half of each coin across the table . " Last . Four fav'r . Man bring one thees , you grant fav'r . " " What fav'r ? " Jin-qua leaned back in his chair . " Doan knowa , Tai-Pan , " he said . " Four fav'r sometime . Not my life maybe , son maybe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half coin one fav'r . Can ? " Sweat chilled Struan 's shoulders . Agreeing to such a demand was an open invitation to disaster . But if he refused , the bullion was lost to him . You put your head into a devil trap , he told himself . Aye , but make up your mind . Do you want the future or na ? You 've known Jin-qua for twenty years . He 's always been fair . Aye , and the shrewdest man in Canton . For twenty years he 's helped you and guided you  --  and together you 've grown in power and riches . So trust him ; you can trust him . No , you canna trust any man , least of all Jin-qua . You 've prospered with him only because you 've always held the last card . Now you 're asked to give Jin-qua four jokers in your pack of life and death . Once more Struan was awed by the subtlety and diabolic cunning of a Chinese mind . The majesty of it . The ruthlessness of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gambling for huge stakes . Both gambling on each other 's fairness , for there was nothing to guarantee that the favors would be granted . Except that you will grant them and must grant them because a deal is a deal . " Can , " he said , holding out his hand . " My custom , shake hand . Na ChiTAT-PAN(IO8) BOOK Inese custom , never mind . " He had never shaken hands with Jin-qua before , and he knew that the shaking of hands was considered barbaric . Jin-qua said , " Fav'r perhaps again ' law . My , yours , savvy ? " " Savvy . You frien ' . You or son no send coin ask bad fav'r . " Jin-qua closed his eyes for a moment and thought about European barbarians . They were hairy and apelike . Their manners were repulsive and ugly . They stank beyond belief . They had no culture or manners or graces . Even the lowest coolie was ten thousand times better than the best European . And what applied to the men applied even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chinese-speaking English barbarian whore at Macao . He had visited her more for curiosity than for satisfaction , encouraged by his friends who said it would be an unforgettable experience for there was no refinement she would not diligently practice if encouraged . He shuddered at the thought of her hairy arms and hairy armpits and hairy legs and cleft , the coarseness of her skin and face , and the stench of sweat mixed with the foul perfume . And the foods that the barbarians ate  --  hideous . He had been to their dinners many times and had had to sit through the innumerable courses , almost faint with nausea and pretending not to be hungry . Watching , appalled , at the stupendous quantities of half-raw meats they knifed into their mouths , blood gravy dripping down their chins . And the quantities of maddening spirits they swilled . And their revolting boiled , tasteless vegetables . And indigestible , solid pies . All in monstrous amounts . Like pigs  --  no , not like pigs : like sweating , gluttonous Gargantuan devils . Un-believable ! They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None . Except their propensity to kill , and this they can do with incredible brutality althoughwith no refinement . And their attribute for making money . At least , they are the medium for us to make money . Barbarians are Evil personified . All except this man  --  this Dirk Struan . Once Struan was like other barbarians . Now he is partially Chinese . In the mind . The mind is important , for to be Chinese is partially a mental attitude . And he is clean and smells clean . And he has learned some of our ways . Still violent and barbarian and a killer . But a little changed . And if one barbarian can be changed into a civilized person , why not many ? Your plan is a wise one , Jin-qua told himself . He opened his eyes and reached across and delicately touched Struan 's hand with his . " Frien ' . " Jin-qua motioned for the servant to pour tea . " Men my bring bullion your factory . Two days . Night . Werry secret , " Jin-qua @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Savvy . I give paper and chop my for bullion . Send tomollow . " " No chop , no paper . Word better , heya ? " Struan nodded . How would you explain it  --  say , to Culum  --  that Jinqua'llgive you one million in silver , will give you a fair deal knowing thatTAI-PAN ( I09 ) BOOK Ihe could ask any conditions , will give you everything you want on a hand-shake ? " Three times ten lac dolla pay Jin-qua , Co-hong debts . Now new year no debt . Good joss , " Jin-qua said proudly . " Aye , " Struan said . " Good joss for me . " " Werry plenty danger , Tai-Pan . No can help . " " Aye . " Werry werry plenty danger . Mustee wait two nights . " " Ayeee yah danger ! " Struan said . He picked up the four half coins . " Thank you , Chen-tse Jin Arn . Thank you very much . " " No thanks , Dir ' Str'n . Frien ' . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . He spoke urgently to Jin-qua , who turned to Struan , frightened . " Servant dooa go ! Gone Sett'ment . All gone ! " CHAPTER 6STRUAN sat in the sedan chair and swayed easily to its motion as the bearer coolies trotted through the silent alleys . The inside of the curtained box was grimed and sweat-stained . From time to time he peered through the curtained side-window openings at the alleys . He could not see the sky , but he knew that dawn was near . The wind carried the stench of rotting fruit and feces and offal and cooking and spices and , mixed with it , the smell of the sweat of the coolies . He had worked out a safer plan with Jin-qua to get the bullion to Hong Kong . He had arranged for Jin-qua to load the bullion in its crates onto an armed lorcha . In two nights the lorcha was to be brought secretly to the Settlement wharf . At exactly midnight . If this was not possible , the lorcha was to be left near the south side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another on the prow . To make sure that there was no mistake , Jin-qua had said that , as a sign , he would paint the near side eye of the lorcha red . Every lorcha had two eyes carved into the teak of their prows . The eyes were for joss and also to help the soul of the boat to see ahead . The Chinese knew that it was essential for a boat to have eyes to see with . But why should Jin-qua let me have Hong Kong safe ? he asked himself . Surely Jin-qua must realize the importance of a mandarin . And why should he want a son educated in London ? Was Jin-qua , of all the Chinese he knew , so farsighted as to understand , at long last , that there was to be a permanent joining of the fortunes of China with the fortunes of Britain ? He heard dogs barking , and through the curtains saw them attack the legs of the front coolie . But the coolie who carried the lantern ahead of the sedan chair ran back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his iron-pointed staff . The dogs fled yelping into the darkness . Then Struan noticed a cluster of bannermen foot soldiers  --  perhaps a hundred  --  seated at a far intersection . They were armed , and had lanterns . They were ominously quiet . Several of the men stood up and began to walk toward the chair . The coolies swerved into an alley , much to Struan 's relief . Now all you have to do , laddie , he told himself , is to get the bullion safe to Hong Kong . Or safe to Whampoa , where you can transshipit into China Cloud . But until it 's safe aboard , you 're na safe , laddie . The sedan chair lurched as a coolie almost stumbled into one of the pot-holes that pockmarked the roadbed . Struan craned around in the confiningspace , trying to get his bearings . Later he could see the masts of ships , half hidden by hovels . Ahead there was still nothing recognizable . The chair turned a corner , heading toward the river , then cut across thisTAI-PAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally ahead , over the roofs of huts , he could make out part of the Settlement buildings glinting in the moonlight . Abruptly the sedan chair stopped and was grounded , throwing Struan to one side . He tore the curtains aside and leaped out , knife in his hand , just as three spears ripped through the thin sides of the chair . The three spearmen desperately tried to pull their weapons free as Struan darted at the nearest one , shoved his knife into the man 's side and spun as another charged him with a double-edged war ax . The ax blade scored his shoulder and he grimaced with pain but sidestepped and grappledwith the man for possession of the ax . He tore it from the man 's hand and the man screamed as a spear aimed for Struan impaled him . Struan backed against the wall . The remaining spearman circled him , panting and cursing . Struan feinted and hacked at him with the ax but missed and the man lunged . His spear pierced Struan 's coat but Struan ripped free and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach and twisted it , gutting him . Struan jumped clear of the bodies , his back against the safety of the wall , and waited . The man that he had knifed was howling . Another was inert . The one he had gutted was holding his stomach and crawling away . Struan waited an instant , gathering strength , and an arrow thudded into the wall above his head . He picked up one of the spears and raced down the alley toward the Settlement . He heard footsteps behind him and ran faster . As he rounded the corner , he saw that Thirteen Factory Street was just ahead . He dropped the spear and zigzagged across the street and into Hog Street , down Hog Street and across the square , which was filled with more bannermen than before . Before the bannermen could intercept him , he was through the garden door . A musket slammed him in the stomach . " Oh , it 's thee , Dirk , " Brock said . " Where the hell 's thee heed ? " " Out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was jumped by stinking highwaymen . " " Be that yor blood or theirs ? " Under the light of the lantern , Struan ripped the coat and shirt away from his wounded shoulder . The slice was clean and shallow across his shoulder muscle . " A gnat 's bite , " Brock scoffed . He found a bottle of rum and poured some into the wound and smiled when Struan winced . " How many were they ? " " Three . " " An ' thee get cutted ? Thee be getting old ! " Brock poured two glasses of rum . Struan drank , and felt better . " I thort you was asleeping . Yor door were locked . Where thee heed ? " " What 's going on here ? " " The servants vanished ' bout an hour ago . That 's wot . I thort it bestTM-PAN ( 112 ) BOOK Inot to bringed everyone here till daybreak . Must be ' arf a hundred guns covered thee while thee ran . " " Then why the devil shove a musket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thee rightly . " Brock gulped some rum . " Just wanted thee to knowed we was awake . " " Anyone know why the servants left ? " " No . " Brock walked over to the gate . The bannermen were settling back into sleep . A nervous dawn hesitated on the horizon . " Looks godrotting bad , " he said , his face hard . " Doan like this here a little bit . Them bastards doan do nothing but sit an ' sometimes beat their drums . I think we better retreat while the retreating 's good . " " We 're safe for a few days . " Brock shook his head . " I got a bad feeling . Something 's right bad . We 'd better goed . " " It 's a ploy , Brock . " Struan tore off a piece of his shirt and wiped the sweat from his face . " Mayhaps . But I got this feeling , and when I gets this feeling it be time to move . " Brock jerked a thumb at the bannermen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty . How-qua sayed there be more'n a thousand spread all round the Settlement . " " I saw perhaps two or three hundred . To the east . " " Where thee beed ? " " Out . " Struan was tempted to tell him . But that will na help , he thought . Brock 'll do everything in his power to prevent the bullion from arriving safely . And without the bullion you 're as dead as you ever were . " There 's a girl just around the corner , " he said flippantly . " Pox on a girl ! Thee baint so stupid to leave for any doxy . " Brock tugged his beard peevishly . " Thee be taking over from me in a hour ? " " Aye . " " At noon we pull out . " " Nay . " " I say at noon . " Nay . Brock frowned . " Wot 's to keep thee here ? " " If we leave before there 's real trouble , we lose face badly . " " Yus . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' tells me it be better . " " We 'll wait a couple of days . " Brock was very suspicious . " Thee knowed I never heed wrong about aknowing when to run . Why thee want to stay ? " " It 's just Ti-sen up to his old tricks . This time you 're wrong . I 'll relieve you in an hour , " Struan said , and went inside . Now wot be Dirk up to ? Brock brooded . He hawked loudly , hating the danger stench that seemed to come from the dying night . TAI-PAN ( 113 ) BOOK IStruan climbed the marble staircase to his quarters . The walls were lined with Quance paintings and Chinese silk hangings . On the landings were giant Ming teak dragons and teak chests . The corridors leading off the first landing were lined with paintings of ships and sea battles , and on a pedestal was a scale model of H.M.S. Victory . Struan found his door locked . " Open the door , " he said , and waited . Ah Gip let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , May-may ? " he said , trying not to show his relief . She was standing in the shadows near the window . She spoke to Ah Gip , then motioned her out . Struan bolted the door . " Where the hell 've you been ? " She moved into the lantern light , and he was shocked by her pallor . " What 's amiss ? " " There 're plenty rumors , Tai-Pan . Word says all barbarians are going to be put to the sword . " " Nothing new in that . Where 've you been ? " " Bannermen are new . There 's rumor that Ti-sen 's in disgrace . That he 's sentenced to death . " " That 's nonsense . He 's cousin to the emperor , and the second-richest man in China . " " Rumor says the emperor 's so godrot angry Ti-sen make a treaty , Ti-sen is to suffer public torture . " " That 's madness . " Struan stood by the fire and stripped off his coat and shirt . " Where 've you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she exclaimed , seeing the cut . " Highwaymen jumped me . " " Did you see Jin-qua ? " Struan was wonder-struck . " How do you know about Jin-qua ? " " I went to kowtow and pay my respects to his Supreme Lady . She told me he just returned and sent for you . " Struan had been unaware that May-may knew Jin-qua 's first wife , but he was so furious that he dismissed this from his mind . " Why the devil did you na tell me where you were going ? " " Because then you would have forbid me , " May-may snapped . " I want to see her . Also to have my hair done and to consult the astrologer . " " What ? " " There 's a terrifical good hairdresser that Jin-qua 's ladies use . Terrifical good for hair . This woman is famous in all Kwangtung . Very expensive . The astrologer said joss was good . Very good . But to watch building of houses . " " You 'd risk your life to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erupted . " What the hell 's the matter with your hair ? It 's fine as it is ! " " You dinna ken these things , Tai-Pan , " she said coldly . " That 's where I hear rumors . At hairdresser 's . " She took his hand and made him touch her hair . " There , you see . It is much softer , no ? " TAI-PAN 114 ) BOOK I " No ! It is na ! God 's death , if you ever leave without first telling me where you 're going , I 'll whack you so hard you will na sit for a week . " " Just try , Tai-Pan , by God , " she said and glared back at him . He grabbed her swiftly and carried her , struggling , to the bed and flung up her robe and petticoats and gave her a smack on her buttocks that stung his hand and tossed her on the bed . He had never struck her before . May-may flew off the bed at him and viciously raked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crashed to the floor as Struan upended her again and resumed the spanking . She fought out of his grip , and her nails slashed at his eyes , missing by a fraction of an inch , and scoring his face . He caught her wrists and turned her over and tore off her robe and underclothesand smashed her bare buttocks with the flat of his hand . She fought back fiercely , shoving an elbow in his groin and clawing at his face again . Mustering all his strength , he pinned her to the bed , but she slipped her head free and sank her teeth into his forearm . He gasped from the pain and slashed her buttocks again with the flat of his free hand . She bit harder . " By God , you 'll never bite me again , " he said through clenched teeth . Her teeth sank deeper , but he deliberately did not pull his arm away . The pain made his eyes water , but he smashed May-may harder and harder and harder , always on her buttocks , until his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't  --  no more  --  please  --  please , " she whimpered , and wept into the pillow , defenseless . Struan caught his breath . " Now say you 're sorry for going out without permission . " Her mottled , inflamed buttocks tightened and she flinched against the expected blow , but he had not raised his hand . He knew that the spirit of a thoroughbred must only be tamed , never broken . " I 'll give you three seconds . " " 1 'm sorry  --  sorry . You hurt me , you hurt me , " she sobbed . He got off the bed and , holding his forearm under the light , examined the wound . May-may 's teeth had bitten very deeply and blood seeped . " Come over here , " he said quietly . She did not move but continued to weep . " Come over here , " he repeated , but this time his voice was a lash and she jerked up . He did not look at her . She quickly pulled the remnants of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I did na tell you to dress ! I said come here . " She hurried over to him , her eyes red and her face powder and eye makeup streaked . He steadied his forearm against the table and daubed the seeping blood away and poured brandy into each wound . He lit a match and gave it to her . " Stick the flame in the wounds , one by one . " " No ! " " One by one , " he said . " A human bite is as poisonous as a mad dog 's . Hurry . " TAI-PAN ( I 15 ) BOOK IIt took three matches , and each time she wept a little more , nauseated by the smell of burning flesh , but she kept her hand steady . And each time the brandy ignited , Struan grit his teeth and said nothing . When it was finished , he slopped more brandy over the blackened wounds and May-may found the chamber pot and was very sick . Struan quickly poured some hot water from the kettle over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had finished he wiped her face tenderly and made her rinse her mouth with some of the hot water . Then he picked her up and put her into the bed and would have left her . But she held on to him and began to weep , the deep inner weeping that cleans away the hatred . Struan soothed her and gentled her until she slept . Then he left and took over the watch from Brock . At noon there was another meeting . Many wished to leave immediately . But Struan dominated Brock and persuaded the merchants to wait until tomorrow . They agreed reluctantly and decided to move into the factory for mutual safety . Cooper and the Americans went to their own factory . Struan returned to his suite . May-may welcomed him passionately . Later they slept , at peace . Once they awoke together and she kissed him sleepily and whispered , " You were right to beat me . I was wrong , Tai-Pan . But never beat me when I am na wrong . For sometime you must sleep and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace was shattered . Wolfgang Mauss was pounding on the door . " Tai-Pan ! Tai-Pan ! " " Aye ? " " Quick ! Downstairs ! Hurry ! " Now they could hear the mob swarming into the square . CHAPTER 7 " MY DA ' warned you all , God damn yor eyes ! " Gorth said , turning away from the dining room window and pushing through the traders . " We 've had mobs before , " Struan said sharply . " And you know they 're always controlled and only ordered out by the mandarins . " " Yus , but not like this'n , " Brock said . " There 's got to be a special reason . Nothing to worry about yet . " The square below was jammed with a heaving mass of Chinese . Some carried lanterns , others torches . A few were armed . And they were screaming in unison . " Must beed two to three thousand of the buggers , " Brock said , then called out , " Hey , Wolfgang ! Wot be they heathen devils shouting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What rotten cheek ! " Roach said . He was a small , sparrowlike man , his musket taller than himself . Mauss looked back at the mob , his heart thumping uneasily , his flanks clammy with sweat . Is this Thy time , oh Lord ? The time of Thy peerless martyrdom ? " I 'll go and talk to them , preach to them , " he said throatily , wanting the peace of such a sacrifice , yet terrified of it . " An estimable idea , Mr. Mauss , " Rumajee said agreeably , his black eyes twitching nervously from Mauss to the mob and back again . " They 're bound to listen to one of your persuasion , sir . " Struan saw Mauss 's beaded sweat and untoward pallor and he interceptedhim near the door . " You 'll do nae such thing . " " It 's time , Tai-Pan . " " You 'll na buy salvation that easily . " " Who are you to judge ? " Mauss began to push past , but Struan stood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long and hurt-filled process , " he said kindly . Twice before he had seen the same strangeness in Mauss . Each time it had been before a battle with pirates , and later , during the battle , Mauss had dropped his weapons and gone toward the enemy in a religious ecstasy , seeking death . " It 's a long process . " " The  --  the Lord 's peace is . . . is hard to find , " Mauss muttered , his throat choking him , glad to be stopped and hating himself for being glad . " I just wanted ... " " Quite right . Know all about salvation meself , " Masterson butted in . He steepled his hands and his manner was pious . " Lord preserve us fromTAI-PAN ( 117 ) BOOK Ithe godrotting heathen ! Could n't agree more , Tai-Pan . Damn all this noise , what ? " Mauss collected himself with an effort , feeling naked before Struan , who once again had seen into the depths of his soul . " You 're . . . you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , if we lose you , who 's left to preach the Word ? " Struan said , and decided to watch Mauss if there was real trouble . " Quite right , " Masterson said , blowing his nose with his fingers . " What 's the point of throwing a valuable Christian to the wolves ? That damned bunch of scallawags is whipped to a frenzy and in no mood to be preached at . Lord protect us ! Goddamme , Tai-Pan , I told you there 'd be an attack . " " The hell you did ! " Roach called from across the room . " Who the devil asked your opinion , by God ? Having a quiet talk to the Tai-Pan and Reverend Mauss , " Masterson shouted back . Then to Mauss , " Why not say a prayer for us , eh ? After all , we 're the Christians , by God ! " He bustled over to the window . " Ca n't a fellow see what 's going on , eh ? " Mauss wiped the sweat off his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only begotten Son , give me Thy peace . Send me disciples and missionariesso that I may lay down Thy burden . And I bless Thee for sendingme the Tai-Pan who is my conscience and who sees me as I am . " Thank you , Tai-Pan . " The door was flung open and more traders poured into the room . All were armed . " What the devil 's going on ? What 's amiss ? " " Nobody knows , " Roach said . " One moment it was peaceful ; the next , they started to arrive . " " I bet we never see poor old Eliksen again . Poor devil 's probably had his throat cut already , " Masterson said , malevolently priming his musket . " We 'll die in our beds tonight . " " Oh , shut up , for the love of God , " Roach said . " You 're a harbinger of sweetness and comfort , ai n't you ? " Vivien , a bullliketrader , glowered down on Masterson . " Why do n't you pee in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Gorth shouldered his way to the door . " I 'll take my bullyboys and blow ' em to hell ! " " No ! " Struan 's voice was a lash . A hush fell . " They 're doing us nae harm yet . What 's the matter , Gorth ? Are you frightened of a few men cursing you ? " Gorth reddened and started toward Struan , but Brock moved in the way . " Get thee below , " he ordered . " Stand guard in the garden , and the first Chinese wot come in , blow his bloody head off ! " Gorth controlled his rage with an effort and walked out . Everyone started talking again . " Saint proper to bait the lad , Dirk . " Brock poured a tankard of ale and drank it thirstily . " He might be handing thee thy head . " " He might . And he might be taught a few manners . TAI-PAN ( 118 ) BOOK I " Excuse me , Mr. Struan , " Rumajee interrupted , his nervousness overcominghis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Aye . Three of my men . They can hold that against an army of this rabble . " There was a burst of arguing among the traders and then Roach said , " I 'm with Gorth . I say we should fight our way out instantly . " " We will . If necessary , " Struan said . " Yus , " Brock said . " Askin ' for trouble to do it now . We waits and keeps our guard up till light . Mayhaps they be gone by then . " " And if they 're not ? Eh ? That 's what I 'd like to know ! " " Then we spill a lot of blood . I snuck three of my men onto our lorcha and put her in midstream . There be a ten-pounder aboard . " Struan laughed . " I think Mr. Brock deserves a vote of confidence . " " By God , Mr. Brock , you 're right smart , " Masterson said . " Three cheers for Mr. Brock ! " They cheered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , best to get some sleep . We be safe enough . " " Gott im Himmel ! Look ! " Mauss was pointing out the window , his eyes bulging . A lantemed procession with gongs and drums was pouring out of Hog Street into the square . Bannermen with flails preceded it , hacking a path through the mob . At the head of the procession was a man of vast girth . His clothes were rich but he was barefoot and hatless , and he staggered under the weight of chains . " God 's death ! " Struan said . " That 's Ti-sen ! " The procession wound into the center of the square and halted . All the Co-hong merchants except Jin-qua were in the procession . All had their ceremonial rank buttons removed from their hats , and they stood quaking . The mob began to jeer and hiss . Then the chief bannerman , a tall , blackbeardedwarrior , banged a huge gong and the mob fell silent once more . An open sedan chair with mounted bannermen in front and behind was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in full ceremonial gray-andscarletdress , was Hi'pia-kho , the imperial Hoppo . He was a squat , obese Manchu mandarin , almost neckless , and in his hand was the imperial fan of his office . The fan was ivory and studded with jade . The Hoppo 's chair was put down in the center of the square and the chief bannerman screamed out an order . Everyone in the square kowtowedthree times and then got up again . The Hoppo unrolled a paper and , under the light of a lantern held by a guard , began to read in a high-pitched voice . " Wot 's he asaying ? " Brock asked Mauss . " Look , there 's old How-qua , " Masterson said with a chuckle . " He 's bloody well shaking in  --  " " Please . Quiet . I ca n't hear , hein ? " Mauss said . He craned out the window . They all listened . " It 's an emperor 's edict , " Mauss said , quickly . " And the traitor Ti-sen , TAI-PAN ( 119 ) BOOK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sent to our capital under sentence of death and . . . '  --  1 ca n't hear , heirs ? Wait a moment  --  ' and the contemptible treaty called the Convention of Chuenpi , that he signed without our authority , is revoked . The barbarians are ordered out of our kingdom and out of Canton and out of Hong Kong under pain of immediate and lingering death and  --  " " I do n't believe it , " Roach scoffed . " Shut thy face ! How can Wolfgang be hearing ? " Mauss listened intently to the eerie high-pitched voice cutting the brooding silence . " We 're ordered out , " he said . " And we 've to pay an indemnityfor all the trouble we 've caused . No trade except under the Eight Regulations . Queen Victoria 's ordered to present herself at Canton in mourning  --  something about . . . it sounded like rewards are on our heads and  --  as a symbol of our displeasure , the criminal Ti-sen will be scourged publicly and all his property is forfeit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bannerman approached Ti-sen and gestured at the ground with his flail . Ti-sen , chalk-white , knelt down and the chief bannerman raised his flail and brought it crashing down on Ti-sen 's back . Again and again and again , There was no sound in the square but for the slash of the whip . Ti-sen fell forward on his face and the bannerman continued to scourge him . " I do n't believe it , " Masterson said . " It 's impossible , " Mauss said . " If they 'll do this to Ti-sen  --  by the Cross , they 'll kill us all . " " Nonsense ! We can take the whole of China  --  any time . " Brock started guffawing . " What 's so funny , heirs ? " Mauss asked impatiently . " This mean war again , " Brock said . " Good , says I. " He glanced at Struan , mocking him . " I told thee , lad . This be wot thee gets for making a soft treaty with the scum . " " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But inwardly he was stunned by what was happening . " Ti-sen 's the richest man in China . The emperor 's got a whipping boy , a scapegoat . And all Ti-sen 's wealth . It 's a matter of face . The emperor 's saving face . " " Thee and thy face , lad , " Brock said , no longer amused . " ' T is thy face that be red . Treaty be finished , trade finished , Hong Kong finished , thee be finished , and all thee talks about be face . " " You 're so wrong , Tyler . Hong Kong 's just begun , " Struan said . " A lot of things have just begun . " " Yus . War , by God . " " And if there 's war , where 's the base for the fleet , eh ? Macao 's as uselessas it always has been  --  it 's part of the mainland and the Chinese can fall on that at whim . But na our island , by God . Na with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're finished .
