Not since the days before Pearl Harbor had a President of the U.S. delivered himself of such gloomy forebodings on the state of the Union . <P> On the domestic front , said John F. Kennedy , the economy " is in trouble . " Unemployment is increasing , the recession worsening , the rate of economic growth lagging , bankruptcies booming , profits fading . In a special message to Congress ( see The Economy ) , he prescribed a course of remedies to get things going again-and promised more if those did not work . <P> But it was on the cold war front that Kennedy talked in stark terms of onrushing national danger . Items : <P> " I speak today in an hour of national peril and national opportunity . Before my term has ended , we shall have to test anew whether a nation organized and governed such as ours can endure . The outcome is by no means certain . " <P> " No man entering upon this office . . . could fail to be staggered upon learning . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass in the next four years . . . Each day we draw nearer the hour of maximum danger . " <P> " The tide of events has been running out , and time has not been our friend . . . The tide is unfavorable . The news will be worse before it is better . . . We should prepare ourselves now for the worst . ' ' <P> In a week when U.S. spacemanship and missilery had won bold successes-the orbiting of Samos , the spy-in-the-sky satellite ( see SCIENCE ) ; the clean triumph of the new solid-fuel Minuteman ICBM ; the Project Mercury shot and recovery of an " astronaut " chimpanzee*-President Kennedy 's grim announcements seemed curiously out of phase , as if he had stumbled upon a copy of the Soviet Doomsday Book . <P> John F. Kennedy had discovered no skeletons in the Eisenhower closet , no cataclysmic secret-intelligence reports . But he had discovered that even a well-informed , alert Senator and President-elect has no conception of the responsibilities of the U.S. presidency . Shortly after April 12. 1945 . Harry Truman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fallen on him . Kennedy was showing something of the same load , but being Kennedy , he came out fighting . He had also discovered , like many a predecessor , that he was bound in his high ambitions by the same realities that had bound the previous Administration-including the realities of Congress ( see The Congress ) . <P> Nevertheless Kennedy had read and digested the contents of the " Crisis Book . " a fat , black-bound State Department file of world trouble spots . It was on this reading that he posed specific concerns : <P> Asia . " The relentless pressures of the Chinese Communists menace the security of the entire area-from the borders of India and South Viet Nam to the jungles of Laos . " <P> Africa . " The Congo has been brutally torn by civil strife , political unrest and public disorder . " The worsening position of the West was soon spelled out in a State Department statement suggesting a drastic policy retreat ( see FOREIGN NEWS ) . <P> Cuba . " Our objection with Cuba is not over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
