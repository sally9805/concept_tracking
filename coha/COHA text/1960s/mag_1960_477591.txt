wHEN the touring " Porgy and Bess " company visited Cairo five years ago , some of its members went one afternoon to a symphony concert . Most of the program was devoted to Mozart , Beethoven , and other classical composers , and it ended with a section called " American Folk Music . " This turned out to be a suite built around " Stormy Weather " and incorporating four other songs : " Blues in the Night , " " I 've Got a Right to Sing the Blues , " " Accentuate the Positive , " and " Ill Wind . " The American listeners were astonished , not only because the songs were all modern , but because they were all by the same man ? Harold Arlen . After the concert Robert Breen , director of " Porgy and Bess , " asked the conductor if he knew who wrote the songs . " But sir , " the conductor said , " nobody wrote them . They are just old American ballads that we made into a folk medley . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pencil scrawl on one page that said H. ARLENE . " When I told the conductor that ' H. Arlene ' was still alive , " Breen recalls , " he just could n't believe it . " The story confirms a feeling about Harold Arlen 's music that is held in many parts of the world . In Europe his songs are heard every where , and quite a fcw are regarded as indigenous ballads dating from Stephen Foster 's day . Yet nobody in Europe knows Arlen 's name , and hardly anybody dues in America , though addicts of his music here are legion . I have been one of these addicts since the early 1930s , when I first heard " Stormy Weather " and " Ill Wind . " Like the Egyptian folklorist many years later , I was moved by something mysterious in these songs . Both of them had a plaintive melody and an insinuating rhythm that seemed peculiarly American and very old , as if they were Negro laments that originated in the South many generations ago . I was surprised to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom 1 had never heard of ) for " The Cotton Club Revue , " a semi-annual Harlem revue that invoked the talents of Bill Robinson , Cab Calloway , Duke Ellington , Ethel Waters , Lena Horne , and many other Negro stars , some already risen high , some barely ascendant . Obviously Arlen had an uncanny instinct for the Negro idiom , in which sadness of melody co-exists with jauntiness of beat . I sensed this not only in his music but in his voice , for several records were issued at the time on which Arlen sang " Stormy Weather " and some other Cotton Club songs . I remember the voice because it was so unusual ? high as a schoolboy 's , but emotional far beyond a schoolboy 's years , and it had a pervading melancholy . I learned that he was not a Negro , but a Buffalo cantor 's son in his late twenties . He was still in them when he moved in 1934 to Hollywood , where he settled down for a long spell of writing movie songs so superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Blues in the Night , " for instance , is hummed the world over ; the film of the same title was forgotten before its customers got out of the theatre , and some could n't get out fast enough . " That Old Black Magic " is a song of amazing durability . So are " Let 's Fall in Love , " " It 's Only a Paper Moon , " " One for My Baby and One More for the Road , " " Accentuate the Positive , " " Happiness Is Just a Thing Called Joe , " " My Shining Hour , " and " The Man That Got Away . " though the movies that they embellished ? like " Star-Spangled Rhythm " and " Here Come the Waves " ? were no great shakes , if any shakes at all . Only " The Wizard of Oz " matched as a film the standard of Arlen and his lyricist , E. Y. Harburg , whose score included one of the most popular of all American songs , ' ' Over the Rainbow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launched the very young Judy Garland , and ever since that wistful start Miss Garland has sung a high proportion of Arlen songs in her shows and on her records . In 1944 , Arlen began writing for the theatre again and composed such scores as " Bloomer Girl , " " St. Louis Woman , " " House of Flowers , " " Jamaica , " " Saratoga , " and " Blues Opera , " the last scheduled to open in California this fall . Through each of these scores there ran certain songs so original in melody and distinctive in harmonic structure that , while no two were alike , the stamp of their composer ? a deep loneliness ? was on them all . ' Come Rain or Conic Shine , " " I Wonder What Became of Me , " and " Steepin ' Bee , " three of Arlen 's finest ballads , are examples . As most of these late numbers were written for Negroes , they seemed an extension , now far more mature , of the idiom that Arlen had caught so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extension of the idiom that George Gershwin captured in his Negro folk opera , " Porgy and Bess . " Arlen is Gershwin 's closest heir in his blue melodic and harmonic line . Sometimes , in fact , Gershwin came close to Arlen , as in " Bess , You Is My Woman Now , " For thirteen years William K. Zins.ser was on the staft of the New York " Herald Tribune " ? as drama editor , movie critic , and editorial writer . He has written two books , " Any Old Place with You " and " Seen Any Good Movies Lately ? " whose opening curve is akin to that of " Ill Gershwin did n't have to borrow from anybody , nor does Arlen , but the two men admired each other 's work and had kindred backgrounds , so it is no accident that their songs have the same American restlessness , while most of our other great theatre composers ? notably Jerome Kern . Richard Rodgers , and Kurt Weill ? are nearer in their lilting airs to the traditions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gershwin 's " Porgy and Bess " so contagious . It has smitten audiences equally in Yugoslavia and Japan , Germany and Brazil . In its score people everywhere seem to find the traits that give America her personality ? not only brittle rhythms and captivating melodies , but excitement and humor and truth . These qualities are also in Arlen 's songs . Where did they come from ? Why should these two men write music so congenial to Negroes ? HAROLD ARLEN , who is now fifty-five and lives in New York , is a slender man with short black hair and limpid eyes of cobalt blue , whose face would be his fortune if his songs were not . At least it is the kind that painters and photographers prize , for it has much in common with that favorite subject of theirs , the tragic clown . It is a vertical face , properly belonging to a blues writer , and in repose it has a lonely look that appears to have been fashioned by decades of sorrow , if not generations . Much of this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arlen 's life , including an illness six years ago that he narrowly survived , and the rest is simply the emotional residue left on the composer by the act of composing , for in this process he is a man totally engaged . But the most arresting quality about Arlen is one of gentleness . He is shy about discussing his music and uneasy with praise . Though his features relax naturally into dolor , they brighten quickly ? if unexpectedly ? whenever something funny is said , and often he is the one who says it . Any fan would guess this about Arlen , for there is a current of humor that runs through many of his songs and gives them vitality . In " We 're Off to See the Wizard , " " A Woman 's Prerogative , " and " Let 's Take a Walk Around the Block " ? to choose three at random from different phases of his career ? a genial lyrical idea is set to a tune that bubbles with enjoyment , or , as in " Accentuate the Positive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra antic value . 44 HAROLD ARLEN Arlen has no trouble tracing his musical gift . " My father was the best of the cantors , " lie says , his voice rustier now than the one I had heard on records long ago , but still a rare instrument . " All the cantors came to my father 's synagogue in Buffalo while I was growing up , but he was the best . He improvised wonderful melodies to fit the texts that had no music , and that 's undoubtedly where my sense of melody comes from . " I learned to play the piano and sing . My big interest was in the jazz instrumentalists of the day . I even ran away from home once to hear the Memphis Five , a Dixieland group . They were my heroes . At fifteen I quit school and formed ' The Snappy Trio . ' We played in night clubs around town and eventually grew into a quintet called ' The Southbound Shufflers , ' working mostly on the lake steamers out of Buffalo . In time we grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He smiled at the remote and corny names , so redolent of the Prohibition era in American jazz . " I was the singer , pianist , and arranger . I could always improvise , and I loved to invent unconventional turns for the men in the band who could n't do anything but follow the written melody . I wanted them to get off it and sound like somebody from New York . " Even better than to be in Buffalo and sound like somebody in New York , of course , was to be in the big city itself , and Arlen migrated there at twenty-two . He served in his triple capacity for various bands , the most famous being that of Arnold Johnson , and still considered himself a vocalist above all . He had never thought of writing songs . His change of direction came about by accident in 1929 during rehearsals of Vincent Youmans ' " Great Day , " for which he had been hired as a singer . When the rehearsal pianist became ill , Arlen filled in briefly , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with something so catchy that it caught everyone within earshot . Admirers of the tune introduced Arlen to Ted Koehler , who set a lyric to it , and the resulting number was sung by Ruth Etting as the finale of the " 9:15 Revue " the following season . It was his first hit : " Get Happy . " Thus Koehler became the earliest of the gifted lyricists who have worked with Arlen , and the boy from Buffalo was lucky to find him at this pivotal moment . Koehler had rhythm and an ear for the colloquial , judging not only by " Stormy Weather , " whose lyric is as much a classic as its melody , but by the many other infectious songs that he and Arlen wrote between 1930 and 1934 for eight Cotton Club revues , suchas " I 've Got the World on a String " and " Between the Devi/ and the Deep Blue Sea . " To what extent Arlen was consciously writing for Negroes in these shows is something that even he ca n't remember , though he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calloway , the first three notes being conceived as a springboard for one of Calloway 's " shouts . " But Cab never got to sing it . Arlen himself made a recording of the song that swept the country before the Cotton Club revue of 1933 opened , and the producers , realizing they had a torch song of considerable value on their hands , brought Ethel Waters out of retirement for the occasion . People flocked to the show mainly to hear the song , and Miss Waters was identified with it for many years . MORE THAN THE RULES ALLOW B LUES in the Night " was born in a somewhat similar manner . Arlen and Johnny Mercer were commissioned in 1941 to write the score for a movie that was to be a serious study of an American jazz hand , and to include in it one hit song of a blues nature . " I went home and just thought about it for two days , " Arlen recalls . " After all , anybody can write a blues song . The hard thing is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song . Finally I decided to cast it in the traditional form of the early American blues ? that is , three sections of twelve bars each , rather than in the conventional Tin Pan Alley shape , " which is , of course , thirty-two bars of a-a-b-a or a-b-a-b . He met his own challenge by writing three memorable themes , rounding off the song with a repeat of the first twelve bars and a four-bar coda , so that the total number came to fifty-two , or twenty more than the rules allow . Mercer remembers that it was a hard lyric to write because of its meandering length , but he resisted official attempts to eliminate the song 's third section , thereby saving one of Arlen 's most haunting melodies . And Arlen remembers plucking the words , " My mama done tole me , " from the bottom of the lyric to the top , where " From Natchez to Mobile " had originally stood , thereby giving world currency to that newly-minted idiom . The whole lyric , in fact , is so right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of the echoing train whistle and the responsive mockingbird ( " take my word , the mockingbird will sing the saddest kind of song , he knows things are wrong " ) , that it stirs fresh admiration still , When " Blues in the Night " was completed , Arlen went over to Jerome Kern 's house and played it for him . Kern listened and then , Arlen says , " went away and came back with Offenbach 's ivory-handled cane , which Alexander Woollcott had given him , and presented it to me . " Arlen , while he regarded the gift as a sign that he had written a good song , nevertheless found it enigmatic , seeing no lineal descent between " Tales of Hoffmann " and his own forlorn ballad . But Kern had his reasons , and they can be found in the Encyclopedia , which says that " Jacques Levy Offenbach , 1819-80 , French composer , was the son of a Jewish cantor . " Obviously the cane has found its proper owner in the twentieth century . Where Woollcott got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first recordings were such an overnight hit that Warner Bros. hurriedly changed their movie 's title to " Blues in the Night , " hoping to salvage with fifty-two bars of music the atrocity which they had by then committed in two hours of film . But honor was beyond saving , except possibly for Elia Kazan , who played the clarinet in a small role , and of course for Arlen and Mercer , whose score also contained the lovely ballad , " This Time the Dream 's on Me . " Mercer , who is from Savannah , sees Arlen 's work as a fusion of classical Jewish music with early Negro jazz ? a combination that keeps the lyricist alert for anything . " Harold 's melodies are way out because Jewish melodies are way out ? they take unexpected twists and turns , " Mercer says , thus defining the term " way out " as well as Arlen 's songs . Mercer might have been thinking of the fact that " Come Rain or Come Shine " begins in one key and ends in another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black Magic , " which runs to seventy-two bars , never exactly repeating what has gone before but always developing the earlier material logically . To Mercer there is a strong affinity between Gershwin and Arlen , especially in their grasp of Negro idioms , and he thinks that this stems largely from the kind of music that they listened to in their youth . " When George and Harold were little boys , growing up within about five years of each other , " he points out , " they were hearing records of Negro spirituals like ' Swing Low ' and ' Motherless Chile , ' and they were also hearing the very early jazz recordings of men like King Oliver . They could n't help being influenced , just as Irving Berlin , for instance , was influenced in ' Alexander 's Ragtime Band ' by the still earlier minstrel shows and street parades . " Arlen is more inventive than Gershwin in trying to find new forms for his songs . The rhythm of both men is wonderful , but George 's often strikes me as mathematical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Down ' or ' Fascinatin ' Rhythm ' ? while Harold 's comes from the bottom of his feet . " Ira Gershwin , who has collaborated with Arlen on such old Broadway scores as " Life Begins at 8:40 " and such recent movie scores as " A Star Is Born , " agrees that Arlen in his blue vein is an extension of George Gershwin in his . " But Harold is no imitator , " he says . " He is always original , always himself . His songs are , well , peculiarly constructed , so that I never know what to expect . I remember thinking that ' The Man That Got Away ' was too long and unorthodox to he a hit , but it grew on people . Harold 's songs always do . " To me the Hebraic influence is the big one in his music , and it 's something that my brother George did n't have . Our parents , like Harold 's , came from Eastern Russia , but there was no Jewish religious music in our family ? in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when George was about eleven , we got a piano and he sat down and played some songs with all the right chords . " If Gershwin 's " Porgy and Bess , " with its nervous rhythms and searching melodies , seems to contain Negro folk elements , as Arlen 's " Blues Opera " does , that may be because of a subtle emotional tie between the two races . Certainly a Jewish composer , conscious of the uprooted history of his people , would be attuned to the similar plight of the American Negro . Arlen , who believes in such mystical forces in music , has a mystical hunch that this is so . WHAT TRUMAN CAPOTE SAID A RLEN has worked with only one lyricist who was a stranger to the musical theatre , Truman Capote . The show that they wrote together , " House of Flowers , " though imperfect , was touched with freshness and beauty . With Capote , Arlen achieved certain effects more sensitive than anything he had done before , such as the superb song , " I Never Has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were hardly idea/ . " We worked together the first three months without personal contact , " Capote recalls . " During this time I was living in Rome , while his base was California . I would send him scenes and scraps of lyrics , and back came homemade phonograph records : Arlen playing melodies that the tentative lyrics had tentatively suggested , singing and talking to me . We had never met , I knew 46 HAROLD ARLEN very little about him . It was quite odd , listening to this disembodied voice and trying to derive from it some notion of what sort of man he might be , my collaborator . Obviously he was a gentle man , a modest one , but someone capable of immense intensity ; and , had I not known differently , I would have thought he was a Negro , His voice , especially his singing voice , had a warm , plaintive , muddy-colored tone , and the diction also had a certain very pleasant Negro quality . " Eventually , when 1 did meet Arlen and we began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmed . The sadness , the echo of loneliness that wails through much of Arlen 's music , seemed to me the foundation of his sensibility , for he is a man obsessed by the tragic view of life . At the same time , amid the sighs , the long sad looks , laughter was always ready to run rampant . He has one of the most distinctive laughs I 've ever heard ? a wild highpitched chuckling that reddens his face and fills his eyes with tears . " I had no true understanding of song writing ( and Lord knows , still do not ) . But Arlen , who I suppose had never worked with an amateur before , was tolerant and infinitely encouraging and , welt , just a gent about the whole thing . A brave gent , too . Twice he spent long and seriously ill spells in the hospital where , against doctors ' orders , against all the laws of human fortitude as well , he continued composing . It was one rainy winter afternoon , while he washospitalized , that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banana Tree ' ? Arlen , weak and ghost-pale , tapping out the rhythm with a pencil and humming at , very literally , death 's door . " For him , music is the entire story . There , inside a world of sound , he is always courageous , intelligent , incapable of clich . His songs almost invariably contain some melodic surprise , some difficulty ? which is one of the reasons he has not had the recognition he deserves . He is too versatile and inventive to have created a large single image , an Arlen sound , in the sense that Porter and Gershwin have a sound . Of course , for those who really know his music , Arlen has a sound , a style , that is immediately recognizable , one more haunting and original than any of his contemporaries : a real blues in the night . " If Arlen 's various lyric writers have been one cause of his anonymity , they have also stretched him in new directions . To each man 's lyrics lie responds differently , which is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , over twenty-five years , has been E. Y. ( " Yip " ) Harburg . Harburg , who has written with other composers such fine songs as " April in Paris " and such scores as " Finian 's Rainbow , " strives for the poetic image in his lyrics . Consequently he touches off in Arlen a quality that is almost stately , as in " Last Night When We Were Young " ( Arlen 's own favorite ) or " Right as the Rain . " Though these songs arc a different facet of their composer , they are as typical of him as the humorous melodies that he often writes for Mercer , such as " Hit the Road to Dreamland . " They are the results of a dogged effort not to be typed . " But , " Arlen says with a wan smile , as if doing obeisance to the joke that fate has played him , " I 'm typed as a blues writer and there 's nothing I can do about it . What 's blue about ' My Shining Hour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' or ? well , I could name many . " He could , too , and that 's what makes the joke so wry . " My Shining Hour , " for instance , is such a pure and soaring tune that you might think Jerome Kern had written it . If Arlen started to name his gay songs , he could include the entire score of " Bloomer Girl . " This Broadway hit of 1944 was a singularly sunny piece of work . To Harburg 's lyrics Arlen wrote fourteen blithe and graceful numbers , including three waltzes , that have an attractive unity and seem true to their Civil War period . Only in one other case did Arlen create such a joyful unit , and that was in " The Wizard of Oz , " There he and Harburg succeeded remarkably in entering the world of children . Though there are few surer ways of making enemies than to dramatize a childhood classic , only the most churlish devotee of Frank Baum 's fantasy land would deny that this film caught the spirit of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merry old land of Oz . " Of course the actors , especially Ray Bolger as the scarecrow and Bert Lahr as the faint-hearted lion , were accountable for much of the movie 's spell , but it was the score that set and sustained the mood . Even so , M-G-M had its worries . " This score is above the heads of children , " one executive told Harburg . He was wrong , needless to say , though it is true that the music and lyrics are more sophisticated than they seem . " If I Only Had a Heart , " for example , is no simple nursery rhyme . At any rate , Arlen and Harburg had the satisfaction of appealing to children without talking clown to them . Ironically , they met the stiffest studio resistance in the case of " Over the Rain bow , " which M-G-M removed three times during the picture 's production . Finally saved from the cutting-room floor , the song won the Academy Award and began a career that will be hard to match for longevity . Longevity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three keys to Arlen 's genius . " His songs get better with time , " he says . " You do n't tire of them , as you do with most pop tunes . Often they 're not easy to get at first ? the public has to grow up to understand them . But if you have faith in what you 're doing , as Harold has , you do n't worry about that . " ( The chances of Arlen 's not worrying are small , but he frets less than he once did over the fact that his songs frequently are slow starters . Quite a few , Iike " Happiness Is Just a Thing Called Joe , " did n't catch on literally for years ) The second attribute of Arlen 's music , Harburg feels , is its universal appeal . " A lot of people can write songs , " he says , " but only an artist can make other people feel the music deeply . Harold touches something in all of us that responds . But what he has above all is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our field who uniquely have this gift ? they make a contribution , break ground , do something that has n't been done before . " Like Mercer , Ira Gershwin , and Capote ? in fact , in almost the same words ? Harburg cited the knotty problems that Arlen hands his lyric writers . " He leads you into situations that are unanticipated , " Harburg says . " I often have to Wait a day or two to let the melody work on me , to see what Harold is really doing . And he 's so afraid of being banal that he revises over and over . " All of Arlen 's collaborators , incidentally , share an affection for the man that matches their admiration for his music . " BLUES OPERA " TO HIS fans Arlen 's masterpiece is a Negro musical of 1946 called " Si . Louis Woman , " whose lyrics are also Mercer 's masterpiece . In this show , based on a book by the Negro writers , Arta Bontemps and Countee Cullen , Arlen 's instincts for Negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old an could have hoped for . It had humorous songs and rhythm songs , blues to break the heart , such as " 1 Had Myself a True Love , " and cakewalks and chorales and lullabies . It was all of a piece , and it was exciting and good . Despite my repeated attendance in the second balcony , the show folded after 131 performances , and one of Broadway 's finest scores seemed lost forever . But in 1954 Robert Breen commissioned Arlen to write an opera around " St. Louis Woman , " and so " Blues Opera " was born . Using as a foundation the original twelve songs and several of his older laments like " Blues in the Night , " Arlen spent the next few years composing a full-length score . The new material is even more exhilarating than what was already there . It consists of dialogue set to music , but instead of emerging as recitative , it has spilled out in a variety of forms that are unfailingly melodic and often breathtaking in rhythm , even if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racetrack and gambling table , or street hawkers ' calls . Sometimes they fall , perhaps only subconsciously , into traditional Negro forms ? into spirituals , for instance , that sound plantation-born . I listened to the score on a makeshift tape recording . Arlen himself was playing the piano and singing most of the parts . A generation had passed since I first heard that sensuous voice and the grieving strains of " Stormy Weather , " both of which augured so much . Now the voice was unburdening itself of some of the richest " Negro " music ? and richest Arlen music ? that I had ever heard . This , needless to say , was Nirvana . For though across the years I had also been collecting Gershwin , Rodgers , Porter , Kern and other great " show tune " composers , Arlen was my secret vice ? secret , among other reasons , because Arlen himself is one of our national secrets , a man as unsung as his music is not .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
