THE FISH CAN SING by Halldor Laxness , translated by Magnus Magnusson. 286 pages . Crowe//. $5.95 . <P> <P> Iceland , a few generations ago , was hardly more than a storybook land ruled by the Danes-a seafarer 's outpost cut adrift from the rest of civilization . Dandelions and buttercups grew on the turf roofs of cottages . Even hens ' eggs tasted of fish . The people seemed dour , except when drunk on words or alcohol , and the only way that one could effectively insult a native was to call him a Dane . <P> It is this period that is warmly evoked by Novelist Halldor Laxness , 64 , who won the 1955 Nobel Prize for such works as Independent People , a story of immemorial peasant life , and Salka Valka , a sociological study of corruption , lust and politics in an Icelandic fishing village . In most of his later novels , Laxness seems to be reliving incidents from his own past . In this book , his narrator is a boy named Alfgrirn , who was born near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young woman bound for America , had paused in Brek-kukot at the friendly cottage of Bjorn , a fisherman , and there gave birth to her child . Then she went on her way ; as the book says in the terse language of the sagas , " she is now out of this story . " <P> Netted Lumpfish . There were seldom empty beds in Bjorn 's household : vagrants and strays of all sorts wandered in and out . One such stray was Gardar Holm , who had the loudest voice in Reykjavik , and who accordingly was sent to Copenhagen to become a singer . Another was a woman from across the island who came to Bjorn 's cottage to die because her own children " would never expect me to be so unkind as to die before their eyes . " <P> Alfgrim grows up regarding Bjorn and his wife as his grandparents . It is a lively existence-going out at dawn with Bjorn to net lumpfish , playing in the nearby churchyard , lending a hand and his voice at funerals and , above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the choirmaster 's daughter , and little Miss Gudmunsen , with her red gloves and fiery temper . When at last he is ready to cross the sea to the university in Denmark , his shawled " grandmother " says : " If you should meet a poor old woman like me anywhere in the world , give her my greetings . " <P> Shared Zest . Author Laxness admits that he is a rarity in Iceland : an enthusiast . His passions have carried him into and out of both the Roman Catholic Church and the Communist Party . His politics appear rarely in his books , but his poetry often . In this novel , Laxness touches with song the most unlikely events , from Jon of Skagi 's self-appointment as custodian of the town lavatory to a great debate that raged in Iceland about whether the establishment of barbershops should be permitted . As a storyteller , Laxness shares with Brazil 's Jorge Amado ( TIME , May 28 , 1965 ) an infectious zest for the eccentricities of ordinary people and a genial affection for those resolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
