txt Once more the American nation  --  and , of course , others far afield  --  pay solemn tribute to a fallen leader . The ceremonies in New York and Washington for Sen. Robert F. Kennedy have again revealed the depth and range of human grief and respect . The role the Kennedy brothers briefly played in this generation is enhanced by martyrdom . Had John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy lived , their paths would have been marked by hot controversy and quite possibly now and then by political defeat . Removed by assassination , they become symbols : of youth , of progressive principles , of the hopes and dreams of people in the United States and elsewhere who want much better political leadership and national life . All the abrasiveness , all the political manipulation , all the weaknesses are obscured by tragedy . The image remains . Contest for alliance The image will require the United States not to slip back into inaction . The remaining presidential candidates on the Democratic side , Vice-President Hubert H. Humphrey and Sen. Eugene J. McCarthy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the Kennedys stood . Each will vie for political alliance with Sen. Edward M. Kennedy , and especially for his presence on the national ticket as a vice-presidential nominee . Senator Kennedy himself will have a difficult decision to make in choosing between these allies . The immediate prospects of a Humphrey-Kennedy ticket are alluring , but the ultimate effects are not so clear , whether on Senator Kennedy 's future or on the morale of the ardent supporters of his brothers and himself . Such a ticket might have elements of national union ; it would also bear the marks of cynicism and expediency . In the national mood , a wave of self-condemnation is followed by a wave of grief . Each may have its therapeutic value . But in the end deeper and broader healing is required . The measures go far beyond political controversy . They start with the problem of hate , with raw emotion , as an element in public life . This has worked both ways , for and against the Kennedys in politics . It is a dangerous tool . By removing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removing the causes of hate . In this task , there can be no substitute for social justice as long as the justice is carried out with a full and fair weighing of the rights on both sides in any human conflict . In the social adjustments taking place now in the United States , the issues are not all white or all black . Social purposes can not be achieved by murders in Alabama or burnings in Washington . The fact is that much social progress is being made . " The revolution of rising expectations " was never more vividly illustrated than it is in the United States today . The picture of a better way of life realistically attainable now by slum dwellers is a chief source of discontent . Not despair but lively expectation stirs up protest . So , after all the killings on lonely roads and in crowded cities , after the mourning A stiffening against violence ? Page 3 and the obsequies , the United States prepares for the future . A political campaign stretches immediately ahead . It should be conducted with propriety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a proven political process . The voters will be offered a choice  --  perhaps within the parties and certainly between . them . Beyond politics , however , is the moral and spiritual strengthening of a nation which is required . The widespread revulsion against violence ought to feed back into television and films , books , periodicals , and the press . In a century marked by two great wars and now by the uniquely repugnant aspects of the Vietnam war , by gangsterism , by widespread slaughter on the highways , by disregard for the sanctity of human life , the return to more austere principles will be difficult . The genocidal decimation of the Jews , Stalin 's sacrifice of millions of innocent Russian peasant farmers , even the recent slaughter of tens of thousands of Indonesian Communists all show the mark of Cain . It will be difficult to turn the tide . But Americans , more even than the others , are challenged to do so .                    @
