Huey Long by T. Harry Williams ( Alfred A. Knopf ; $12.50 ) In January , 1935 , the T.R.B. of that day wrote in this journal that a new " anti-administration leader " was emerging in the United States Senate . The man : Huey P. Long , of Louisiana . Early in February , Senator Burton K. Wheeler , the Montana progressive leader , used a dinner party at Rexford Tugwell 's to denounce the Roosevelt Administration 's apparent partiality to conservatives . The one man capable of getting rid of the Senate 's conservative Southern leadership , Wheeler told the gathering , was Huey Long . In March , a Chicago shoe salesman wrote a letter to Huey : " I voted for Pres. Roosevelt but it seems Wall St. has got him punch drunk . What we need is men with guts to go farther to the left as you advocate . " Meanwhile , Huey 's Share Our Wealth movement claimed millions of adherents . A poll taken by Jim Farley showed that Huey might get four million votes on a third-party ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the election . Early 1935 was , to be sure , a low point for the New Deal , seemingly floundering in indecision and confusion . Yet that summer , when Roosevelt suddenly launched the Second Hundred Days , millions concluded it was ( in FDR 's own phrase ) simply an attempt to " steal Huey 's thunder . " What Long might have gone on to achieve , had he not been assassinated in September of that year , no one can say . His goal was the White House , and Huey had a way of reaching his goals . It is unlikely he could have gained that high prize , but he was only eleven days past his forty-second birthday when he died . With perpetual re-election by Louisiana 's voters guaranteed , Huey could conceivably have remained a major figure in US politics until the present day . In the thirties in any event , few Americans seemed completely convinced that the Kingfish of Louisiana was simply , in one present-day historian 's phrase , an " ephemeral political aberration . " Certainly no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salesman 's happy opinion of him was not , however , predominant nationally . Many more saw in Huey the first real American dictator , a " Hitler of the bayous , " a fascist menace to the republic , at the very least the most successful demagogue ever to come out of that Southern politics which had produced so many such men . It is these labels ? " dictator , " " demagogue , " " fascist " ? which T. Harry Williams would like to expunge from Huey 's image . Professor of history at Louisiana State University ( an institution whose athletic and academic fortunes the Kingfish made one of his major concerns ) and well known as a Civil War scholar , Williams has written not only the first biography of Long in a quarter century , but the first scholarly one ever . It is also , though enormously useful , the most disappointing one ever . Williams first expressed his mildly revisionist views on Long in two brief articles almost a decade ago , when he had already been researching Huey for five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Demagogue or Democrat ? , " served as Williams ' presidential address to the Southern Historical Association . It is perhaps the most curious aspect of the new book that in its 876 pages Williams presents his views not only less concisely , but less comprehensively and less comprehensibly than he did in that 19-page article . In the book the facts often overwhelm the framework , and the reader is engulfed in a maze of details that often do little to clarify or illuminate the admitted complexities of Long 's career and character . It seems unlikely , for example , that many readers outside Louisiana itself will find much meaning in Williams ' accounts of the complex haggling over where to build a Lake Pontchartrain bridge , or in the differences between the early Louisiana and Arkansas workmen 's compensation laws , or above all in the interminable and of ten unfathomably tangled maneuverings of New Orleans ' various political factions . For the serious student of Long , of course , such an assemblage of information about the man has never before been available in one place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for it was developed by the author during years of invaluable research . Since there are few original Long papers ( letters or diaries ) extant , Williams adopted the " oral history " technique . Armed with a recommendation from Huey 's son , Senator Russell Long , he interviewed or obtained statements from almost 30o Long friends , family , followers , and enemies . Many of them seem to have spoken with remarkable frankness . As a result , some aspects of Huey 's career ? such as the extralegal financing of the Long organization , and details of the " round robins " which saved Huey in the 1929 impeachment crisis ? are revealed with a depth and accuracy never before available . Williams also outshines all previous writers on Huey 's early life ? his boyhood , schooling , travelling salesman days , and early legal career ? despite the author 's sometimes excessive penchant for speculation on uncertain points . Along the way he convincingly demolishes several Huey-inspired myths ( e.g. , that the Longs were classic " poor whites , " or that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ) accepted by most earlier writers . It is when Williams is at pains to disprove the " demagogue " and " dictator " labels that his efforts are least convincing . For instance , claiming that both terms are of European . origin and thus have " little validity for the American scene " does not seem to get us far conceptually . Nor does a proposal to substitute for " demagogue " Eric Hoffer 's " mass leader " description , especially when Williams elects to follow Hoffer in classifying his " mass leaders " as either " good " or " bad . " This is the same sort of pointless circularity which attributes a politician 's public appeal to his " charisma . " Williams , unfortunately , also adopts that argument . But if these views simply indicate a curious partiality for the meaningless , Williams ' repeated attempts to blunt the charge of " dictatorship , " have a more ominous quality . Central to any debate over Huey 's career is the question of means and ends . All observers admit that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planters , manufacturers , oilmen , and New Orleans machine politicians . In order to put through even his limited neo-Populist program of paved roads , free bridges , free schoolbooks , expanded hospitals , and so on , Huey always insisted that he had to use drastic methods . Williams firmly agrees with him ( " The politician who wishes to do good may have to do some evil to achieve his goal " ) , and time and again he defends Huey 's controversial tactics . Not till the last two years of his life , 1934-35 , when Huey practically abolished all local government in the state , does Williams seem to feel that Huey went " too far , " and then only on the grounds that the oligarchy 's power was already broken . It is a problematic area , but I feel Williams tends both to exaggerate the " unrelenting . . . unreasoning " nature of the oligarchy 's hostility before Huey began his power grabs , and to excuse too many of his high-handed tactics . " Genius " in a politician may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignoring existing rules and making up his own " ; but in any responsible political system , some rules are at least as important as the policy goals of current political leaders . Ends like paved roads ( which were generally Huey 's proudest boast ) simply will not justify some of the means he used long before 1934 . Despite Williams ' questionable interpretations , his account of Huey 's activities as governor and later as absentee landlord of Louisiana is full and factually sound . The same can not be said for the chapters dealing with Long 's career in the Senate and national politics from 1932 till his death . This section is thin and weak , the greatest disappointment in the book , perhaps because it seems to interest the author least . There is little new material here , for Williams ' interviews were primarily with Louisiana figures , and the available old material is not handled especially well . Like many biographers , Williams often overestimates his subject 's importance in events , most notably his role in Roosevelt 's " turn to the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Share Our Wealth movement " was not the only , or even the " most potent , " factor prompting the President 's new approach . Nor , despite the incidents related at the beginning of this review , can one accept Williams ' judgment that by late 1933 Huey " had emerged as the leader of the American left . " The literary and intellectual left always scorned him as either a clown or a fascist , and few politicians on the left were prepared to recognize him as their leader for long . In fact , at this date the Share Our Wealth movement had not even been launched , and Huey 's public following nationally was still quite small . Symptomatic of Williams ' problems with Huey 's senatorial career is his interpretation of several votes Huey lost by large margins . On one occasion , where he hoped to prevent FDR from presenting a veto message in person , the Kingfish was outvoted 44 to four . Yet Williams claims the fact the other 4t3 , senators " abstained " is " a possible indication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is nonsense , especially since the Congressional Record shows that at least 35 of the 48 who did not bother to vote on the issue would have opposed Huey 's stand . Also weakening the whole book is a writing style sometimes reminiscent of old Timestyle . If characters do not " snort , " " trumpet , " " crow , " " chortle , " " spit out , " or " leer " their words , they seem without fail to utter them " grimly , " " amiably , " " coolly , " or " impudently . " Such vividness may help the casual reader through the masses of information , but it seems misplaced in what is clearly intended to be the definitive biography of Long . Nor has the author always been well served by his publisher . The book is dotted with minor lapses in copy editing or proofreading ( e.g. , " Adolph Hitler , " " inferring " for " implying , " numerous typos ) ; the index is inadequate and sometimes inaccurate ; no maps are provided , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in Huey 's story . In view of the book 's virtues ? it is the fullest , most " objective " portrait of the Kingfish yet produced ? one has to be disappointed over its faults . In this respect , the book is not unlike its subject . Raymond Moley once wrote perceptively of Huey that he had " an extraordinarily powerful , resourceful , clear and retentive mind , an instrument such as is given to very few men . No one can tell what services he could have rendered his state and nation had he chosen to use that mind well . " Yet there was about him " a sense of tragedy ? a tragedy of wasted talent , " for he " misused his mind , squandered it , battered it . . . " Professor Williams ' book is no tragedy , nor has he abused his obvious talents . Yet I can not avoid a feeling of regret that the book did not match its potentiality.                 @ @ @ @
