txt // of one beveled edge . It is not possible to turn a large hook , but a very sharp fine scraping edge or burr can be secured that is excellent for finishing a surface by hand . The method used for sharpening a square edge on a hand scraper is as follows : Hone off the old hooks by placing the scraper blade flat down on an oilstone and whetting till the old hook is gone ( Fig. 1-10 ) . With the edge that is to be sharpened up , or on top , clamp the scraper blade in a vise . File a square edge on the blade with a fine 10 " or 12 " mill file . File from edge to edge , rounding off the two corners slightly as in a plane iron .

Repeat the processes until the edges are square and sharp ( Fig. 1-12 ) , // ( 6 ) Tun the situate eutting edges down to al ) ouut 85 ' with a large smooth burnisher , holding the blade firmly in a bench vise . Use about four strokes in turning the edge , increasing the pressure and decreasing the angle with the face side each time ( Fig. 1-13 ) . The small , sharp burr or hook on a hand scraper will do wonders in smoothing defective places that can not be removed with sandpaper ( Fig . A few of the coniferous woods such as cypress and some very soft woods do not scrape well . On such woods the scraping operation should he omitted . Soft woods which can not be scraped satisfactorily can be smoothed very effectively with a sharp plane ; scraping in such cases is not important and should not he attempted . Curved scrapers can be used to advantage especially for smoothing concave surfaces . A scraper blade may be filed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a hook similar to that put on a square scraper . A beveled-edge hook is Frequently put on curved scrapers . A scraper of this kind // // is often helpful in smoothing up surfaces which are made with a gouge . In addition to the scrapers described thus far , so-called hook scrapers are on the market which do a satisfactory job of removing roughness in grain pattern . These scrapers come with replaceable blades . After the blade is resharpened a few times , it is discarded and replaced by a new one . Plugs and Cement for Holes and Cracks . Various small defects such as wormholes , knotholes , dents , torn fibers in sivall spots , and places that have been injured 1w tools or in some other way during the process of construction , are frequently found on otherwise perfect surfaces . If the injury is large , as a knothole extending through the board , it is fre ( Iuently best to insert a plug of wood and to glue it into place . Sometimes had defects can he chiseled out , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so carefully inlaid and glued into place that it will hardly show when finished . This kind of repair takes more time thin other processes , but is permanent and causes less disfigurement to the piece , if ( lone skillfully . Another process commonly used in factories is to fill the defective place with cabinet maker 's cement . This material is made for furniture factories , and comes in bricks having a color resembling wood . In use , fragments of cement are broken up , melted , and thinned with water to a thick paste which can be pressed into the defect with a putty knife . The opening should be filled slightly too full when first put in place and sanded level after it has dried . The spot of cement will usually take stains nearly the same as the wood itself . If the cement is used on a dark-colored wood , or it in a spot in a cedar chest , the cement should be stained to the proper color with dry pigments before it is used . There are also water putties on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water and pressed into place with a putty knife . An old method for repairing small defects is to secure some fine dust from sanding the surface of the wood which has the defect . This powder is then mixed with a liquid cold glue , making a paste which can be pressed into place with a putty knife . When dry the spot can he sanded . A repaired place of this kind filled with glue paste will not stain well . Paste can be mixed with dry colors , however , while in the wet form and made nearer the proper color . Glue paste should be quite thick , and in use should not be spread over the sur-face of the wood around the defect because glue sizes wood and prevents stain from " taking " when the article is stained later on .

Assemble the tools and materials needed to do the repair job . These include : burning-in knife , alcohol lamp , small steel scraper , pumice stone , and a variety of shellac sticks ( Fig. 1-15 ) . Select ; c piece of shellac that matches the color of the wood and finish as closely as possible ( Fig. 1-16 ) . Heat the binning-in knife lightly over an alcohol flame . Alcohol is preferred because an alcohol flame leaves no black carbon on the knife ( Fig. 1-17 ) . With the point of the knife , melt off a small amount of shellac from the stick and work it into the hole that needs filling ( Fig . I-IS ) . Smooth the filled area carefully with the heated knife ( Fig. 1-19 ) . When the shellac is completely dry , scrape the repaired spot with the steel scraper ( Fig . I-20 ) . Such a scraper is sharpened like a regulau- hand scraper , except that the edges are not turned down with a burnishing tool . After smoothing it like this , rub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using a little pumice stone as the abrasive ( Fig. 1-21 ) . Dents can sometimes be removed by steaming with a wet cloth and a hot iron . Hot water alone if put into a dent several times will sometimes swell the compressed fibers back to nor-mal condition and thus practically remove the unsightly spot . A putty knife , if carefully heated about as hot as a flat iron when used for ironing , will help to raise a dented spot if placed over wood that has been well moistened with water . In all of these cases the wood fibers are swelled by steam and are likely to resume nearly their original shape , thus causing the dent to disappear . // Chapter H Surface Abrasives and Their Use Importance of Surface Preparation . Proper surface preparation is the first operation in successful wood finishing . It is here that the actual process of finishing starts . Sanding rules , although few and simple , must be clearly understood and strictly adhered to . It is also important to know the different kinds of abrasives , their grades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tedious and time-consuming operation has now been reduced to a minimum of work by the development of mechanical sanding machines . Although a certain amount of hand sanding will always be necessary , the greater share of the work is now performed by means of these mechanical devices . Whether surfaces are prepared by hand or machines , the proper preparation of all surfaces is of utmost importance . No amount of filler , varnish , or lacquer will hide an underlying rough surface . On the contrary , it only magnifies dents , scratches , and other surface defects . Inspection Before Sandpapering . Inspection of the surfaces to be sandpapered is an important preliminary which should never be overlooked . If rough spots or planer marks have been left they should be found and removed before any sanding is attempted . Hand sandpapering will not remove or cover up defects of this kind . It is a waste of time and increases the difficulty . Scraping out the unfinished places later on is harder because sandpapering always leaves sand in the pores of the wood , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Very frequent sharpenings of the hook on a scraper are necessary , if scraping is attempted after wood has been sandpapered . Aivatem= wood finishers should learn what defects to look 29 // for , and should realize that planer marks and minor blemishes that hardly show on the natural wood are greatly exaggerated on the finished piece , especially , if stain of any kind is used . Rough surfaces practically always expose more cross sections of the pores or end grain , which , when stained , Neill show darker than the rest of the surface . This is clue to the fact that the end grain of wool is always more porous than the ordinary grain of longitudinal or tr , utSVerse stetious ( Fig. 2-I ) . Sandpaper Manufacture . Sandpapers oI the present clay are not made from s.utcl and paper . The grit which looks like sand is made from quartz or flint rocks ( Fig. 2-2 ) . The red or garnet papers have a grit made front garnet ore ( Fig. 2-3 ) . Great hardness and sharpness of edges are important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has few sharp edge 's , as all such cutting places are soon worn off and smoothed by rub-bing against each other , just as rocks on the mountain sides are smoothed and rounded by glacial action . Sharp grit is made from crushing hard rock and sifting in order to secure particles of uniform size . Various sizes of rock fragments , sometimes called sand , are secured in order that sandpaper of different grades of coarseness and fineness may be manufactured . Flint and garnet are classified as natural abrasives . In addition to these natural abrasives a number of artificial ones have been perfected . Examples of this type are silicon carbide and aluminum oxide . Silicon carbide is chemically composed of carbon and silicon . Through heat treatment in an electric furnace it is formed into blue-black crystals . As an abrasive it is extensively used in the finishing field ( Fig. 2-4 ) . Aluminum oxide is also produced by heat treatment in an electric furnace . Although not so hard as silicon carbide , it is tougher and does not fracture so easily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Fig. 2-5 ) . The best grades of paper are strong , especially when made from Manila fiber , which is sometimes secured from old ropes . The strength is also increased by a crisscross or uneven arrangement . Papers which are made so that the fibers are not 31 parallel with their lengths in one direction are stronger crosswise and have nearly iniiforni strength in every direction . Such papers an ' ditlicnit to tear and , if torn , leave a rough uneven edge . Thicker papers are iisecl when coarser grits are to he applied . In recent years some significant changes have been made // in the methods of covering abrasive cloth and paper ( Fig. 2-6 ) . Formerly the abrasive grains were sprinkled evenly on a previously glue-prepared surface . This method is now largely replaced by what is known as the electrostatic process . Here the abrasive grains are electrically imbedded into the cloth or paper surfaces . This action results in placing the particles more uniformly , in a position to give a sharper and faster cutting surface . Waterproof paper has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can be used to great advantage over a wet felt pad . The finer grades of waterproof sandpaper , such as the 5/0 to 8/0 sizes , are excellent for sanding varnish between coats . A varnish surface smoothed with one of these papers having the finest grit looks much like a finish rubbed with pumice stone and the operation can be completed in much less time . Sizes of Sandpaper . Many sizes of grit are used in manufacturing sandpaper , ranging from 8/0 to 4 , as follows : ( 1 ) Vertu fine or soft papers , used by wood finishers : from 00000000 , or 8/0 , to 00 , or 2/0. ( 2 ) Medium sizes , commonly used by woodworkers : 0 , or 1/0 , 1/2 , 1 , 1 ? ' , 2. ( 3 ) Vertu coarse papers , more commonly used on sanding machines for rapid cutting : 2 ? ! , 3 , 3 ' 4 . Sizes finer than 8/0 sandpaper are made by some manufacturers , but are not commonly found on the market . For many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " x 11 " was sold in quires and reams . A quire contained 24 sheets and a ream was made up of 20 quires or 480 sheets . This method of packaging was simplified in 1948 . Since that year sheets of abrasives are packed in sleeves of 25 , 50 , and 100 sheets . Ten sleeves form a unit . Some supply catalogs list abrasives in minimum packages of 50-100 sheets and standard unit packages of 500-1000 sheets . Use of Sandpaper . The cardinal principle in the use of sandpaper is that all sanding must be with the grain ( Fig. 2-7 ) . Never make circular , cross-grain , nor oblique strokes with sandpaper , as scratches always result . End grain of wood must be sanded crosswise . A careful study of wood structure with a magnifier shows that the fibers are arranged like parallel tubes lengthwise of the grain . These fibers are scratched , torn , or cut through by the sharp edges of the sand grit if the strokes are in any other direction than lengthwise of the grain . Resanding with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scratches . Such injuries should be scraped out , and after all scratches have disappeared , the surface should he sanded , pushing the sandpaper with the grain of the wood . Blocks for holding sandpaper in order that greater pressure may be applied are used in every finishing room . The size , weight , and covering for the blocks depend upon the kind of work . For big surfaces a rather large heavy block iris sonic advantages . A brick covered with canvas or other cloth is used iu some shops for coarse work , especially where rapid cutting rni large surfaces is desired . For the first sanding with coarse sandpaper , sonic workmen prefer a hard flat block with little or no covering . This will cut off the high spots better and help to reduce the somewhat irregular surface to a truer surface . 34 // A favorite size of sandpaper for use on many kinds of wood for the first sanding is No. 1 or 11 , ; . For the finer-grained woods one should use the No. 1 , which is finer than No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done with a soft block or a block with a soft cover . Corks about 1 " x 3 " x 6 " in size are preferred by some ; another size sold on the market for such work is 1 " x 4 " x 4 " . Felt faced or cloth covered blackboard erasers can be used very satisfactorily for sanding blocks . Some finishers use rubber faced blocks . A homemade block of this kind can be prepared from a rectangular scrap of soft wood to which is tacked a piece of rubber taken from an automobile inner tube . The sizes of sandpaper used for fine sanding are about 1 or O. Sometimes 00 paper is preferable for very fine grained hard wood . Rounding off the corners of a piece of wood in sanding is a very common fault that must be avoided , or the appearance of the finished work will be ruined . This does not mean that the sharp feathered edges should not be slightly smoothed off to get rid of slivers , for this should always be done with fine sandpaper in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rocking motion while sanding , corners and edges will become rounded off unevenly , and poor work is the result . End grain sanding is just as important as sanding of the surfaces and edges . If the end grain is left too rough , additional stain will be absorbed there ; consequently it will become darker than other portions of the surface . When sanding end grain , the finisher should sand in one direction only , rather than with a back and forth motion . By lifting the sanding block off the stock after reaching the end of the stroke , lie will flatten out the wood fibers more readily and make a smoother surface . The use of sandpaper between the successive coats of finish is necessary in securing a level surface and proper adhesion of the films of shellac , varnish , or lacquer that are to be applied later on in the finishing process . The kind and size of sandpaper , and the method of using it , depend upon various conditions . Two types of sandpaper are used by wood finishers : ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grit ; and ( 2 ) waterproof sandpaper . The standard type has already been described in previous paragraphs of this section . // Waterproof sandpapers have been developed to help solve several problems of the finishing room . The use of such papers enables a workman to sand a moist surface of wood soon after it has been sponged , thereby saving a certain amount of time . Sanding with wet paper reduces the dust in the room which helps to preserve the health of the finisher and to reduce danger of specks i  --  varnish finishes . For sanding moist wood to remove fuzz , rather fine grades of grit , such as sizes 1/2 , 0 , or 00 , should be used in most cases . Waterproof papers , which do not lose their grit when dampened and kept in that condition during several minutes , are often preferred for rubbing between coatings of varnish ; and , when used over a rubber or felt block , they produce a level surface without gloss , more quickly : ind more satisfactorily , between the first coats especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done with the grain only , where this is possible , and fine grades of grit , sock as the 5/0 to 8/0 , leave an excellent surface for refinishing . Automobile painters arc using a special sandpaper which can also be used wet . Automobile finishers ' sandpaper is sold by number ; such as No. 280 , rather coarse ; No. 320 , medium in grit ; and No. 400 , very fine . These sandpapers are used for smoothing undercoats and surfaces of lacquer which must be made level in preparation for the next coat . They scratch if they are used dry , and for this reason they are kept wet when rubbing varnished or lacquered surfaces . Steel Wool and Its Use . Steel wool is often used in smoothing concave surfaces . The sizes of steel wool most commonly used are : 000 or 3/0 , 00 or 2/0 , 0 , 1 , and 2 ; 000 being the finest , and No. 2 the coarsest . Cartons or packages of steel wool in 1-pound , 5-pound , and 10-pound sizes are sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varnish supply houses . In use , a ball or wad of steel wool is taken in the hand , and the surface is rubbed as with sandpaper . Strokes should be made with the grain whenever possible , as scratches will result if the abrasive is used crosswise or obliquely . Steel wool can be bought in ready-made , layer-built pads . They are easy to work with and more economical than pieces of steel wool torn from a package . Their layer-built construction enables the user to fold back each used layer , exposing a // fresh , new surface . A 1-pound package contains sixteen pads . The packages are graded from No. 4/0 , fine , to No. 3 , course . Sponging and Resanding . Beauty and clearness of grain can be secured by sponging with water . This is done in order to dampen and raise the grain on all surfaces that are to be finished . Sponging the surface may be done with a wool sponge , an ordinary sponge , or with a soft large brush that holds water well . The wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fibers on the surface with water , yet with not enough to leave a layer or coating that takes considerable time to dry . An excess of moisture might injure glue joints particularly those of veneer . Fuzz appears over the entire surface of any piece of wood that has been sponged and allowed to dry . The surface of a piece of wood consists of cells which are something like long tubes running lengthwise of the grain . Many of these cells are cut through , exposing the ragged walls , when the processes of planing and scraping are done ( Fig. 2-8 ) . Some of this roughness , however , is removed by sanding . The finest sandpaper does not remove all the fragments of the cell walls . Some of these particles are more or less loose after sanding , and swell up and stiffen as a result of sponging and drying , and become the fuzz that can he felt on a sponged board after it has dried . The fuzziness on the surface of wood that has been moistened can largely he removed by resanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using 2/0 , 3/0 , or even 4/0 sandpaper over a block , as described in the first sanding operation . Careful use of sandpaper , using long full strokes with the grain , leaves the surface in a very smooth condition . Sponging , and resanding a second time very slightly improve the surfaces of some kinds of wood , but not enough to pay for the trouble . Sponging and resanding are always necessary if water stains are used because these operations prevent the stain from raising the grain or fuzz . If stains that do not contain water are used in the finish , the sponging and resanding operations are usually omitted on account of the cost of extra work required . Excessive use of water in sponging , and excessive pressure on the sandpaper , should both be avoided on veneered work , or spots may be cut through which can not be repaired with38 Coloring , Finishing , and Painting Wood out reveneering .

Instead of sponging the wood surfaces with water , an application of glue size can be made . Normally it is done just before the final sanding . The purpose of glue sizing is to raise auv loose and ruptured wood fibers which may have resulted from a previous operation . As the glue size dries , the stiffened fibers are cut off more cleanly and evenly in the final sanding . A satisfactory glue size is prepared as follows : 1 . Soak one part of hide glue in two parts of water . 2 . Let it stand until all the glue has softened . 3. 1teat this mixture to a temperature of from 140 ? to 150 ? Fahrenheit until a uniform liquid mixture is obtained . 4. l ) iliite with additional Water . A satisfactory mixture is obtained by adding eight parts of water to one part of liquid glue . A glue size may he applied either by spraying , brushing , or sponging . All surfaces must be thoroughly dry before they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5/0 . Paper coarser than 5/0 cuts through the glue size and in so doing eliminates the benefit of the size . Glue sizing has been found to be useful in partly eliminating so-called " pin-holing . " This difficulty is often encountered with certain kinds of mahogany . Pin holes result when air escapes from improperly filled pores . A glue size tends to plug these pores , allowing a better filling job . Although it may not completely stop this trouble , it helps to some extent . The application of too much glue size and improper sanding afterward may cause trouble when the actual finishing starts . Stain , especially non-grain-raising stain , may not penetrate so deeply as desired . If this is the case , additional sanding is necessary . Surfaces , when properly sized and sanded , will show a slight resistance to taking up stain , but not enough to cause any difficulty . // Sanding Machines Used in Wood Finishing . Up to this point little or no mention has been made of the usefulness of various types of sanding machines . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school and home work-shops . Actual shop experience and tests conducted have proved that a wood surface can be sanded and rubbed by mechanical means in from 50% to 70% less time than by ordinary hand sanding and rubbing . The more commonly used sanders are the following : Belt sanders : These machines are made in a variety of sizes and forms . They are especially useful for sanding large , flat surfaces . By changing the belt from coarse to fine , resulting surfaces need little additional attention before the actual finish-ing starts . Some of the smaller belt sanders have belts that travel in a horizontal or vertical position . These machines will readily sand small pieces ( Figs. 2-9 and 10 ) . An adjustable table makes it possible to sand at different angles . Inside curves can be sanded by using the curvature formed by the pulley ( Fig. 2 - I1 ) . Disk sanders : A disk sander is simply a revolving metal 40 disk to which a sheet of abrasive paper has been fastened . The table that supports the stock can usually be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fence which makes it possible to do accurate sanding on end grain ( Fig. 2-12 ) . Spindle sander : Spindle sanders resemble a wood shaper and operate in a vertical rotary motion . Some machines have in addition an oscillatory or up and down motion . The abra42 Coloring , Finishing , and Painting Wood sive sleeve is mounted either on rubber rolls or on felt covered split rolls . By tightening the nut on the spindle , the operator makes the rolls expand slightly and keep the abrasive sleeve in place . This machine is particularly useful in sanding inside curves . When no spindle sander is available , the operations per-formed on this machine can be done on an ordinary wood lathe . To use the lathe as a sander , first make one or more wooden cylinders . Next cover these cylinders with abrasive paper . With the cylinder mounted between the live and dead center of the lathe , do inside sanding from either the top or the bottom of the cylinder . Portable sanders : The advantage of portable sanders is that they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 and 15 ) . They should be handled carefully and maintained according to the manufacturer 's instructions . Most of them require a special grease and oil . Oscillating or Straight-Line Action Sanders : These sanders are especially useful in doing the final sanding . They are often referred to as finishing sanders , since the finest grades of sand-paper can be used on them . The sanding action on these machines is by short forward and backward strokes ( Figs. 2-16 and 17 ) . // When purchasing or using these sanders , one should be sure that the machine has a back and forward motion only . Many of the smaller sanders have a slight side motion . These so-called " vibrators " leave small circular scratches , which become quite noticeable when stain is applied to a wood surface . Portable air sanders : In addition to these sanders there are several portable air sanders on the market with either one or two sanding pads . The pad motion on the two-pad machine is straight-line , whereas that on the single-pad sander is either straight or orbital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; those with two pads for large , flat sur-faces ( Fig. 2-18 ) . Air sanders have various sized sandpaper and rubbing at-tachments , all of which are interchangeable and so adaptable to almost all types of sanding and rubbing operations . They can be successfully used on the five steps typical in wood-finishing operations : white sanding , wash coat sanding , pad-ding filler , scaler sanding , and rubbing final finishes . // Since these machines operate by means of compressed air , a number of accessories ? such as filter and moisture trap , pressure regulator , gauge , and automatic oiler ? are needed . Dust Sanded Surfaces . The last operation in the prepara tion of the surface of wood should be a thorough dusting with a stiff bristle brush that will remove all dust and broken frag ments and much of the sand from the pores of the wood . The brushes commonly used for this purpose are called picking brushes . If the wood is to be filled with wood-filler , the dust ing operation is of considerable importance , because it cleans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or pores ; and , at the same time , it removes any loose gum or other waste matter that may have been left in the cell lumina as end products of food growth or digestion . Picking brushes should be used on open grained woods for dusting , but close grained woods that require no filler may be dusted with any coarse dusting brush . Dust will settle on any article in a few hours ' time ; conse quently every piece of wood should be dusted just before any wood finishing process is started , and just before any later coat is applied . Chapter III Wood-Stains and Water-Staining Reasons for Staining. 1 . Color harmony of the woodwork with the furnishings of a home requires staining , for wood in its natural tones does not usually harmonize with textiles and wall colors . Changing a garish , unpleasant color to a softer more attractive one that will take a place in a color scheme is an important reason for staining. 2 . Creator beauty in a particular article can often be secured by staining . This can sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it look like an expensive , beautiful one , such as incitation mahogany finish on birch through staining ; or , the coloring ivav bring out unsuspected qualities and beauty in the wood itself , by accentuating contrasts and bringing before the eye attractive natural characteristics which are not emphasized in the unstained material . The reaction of the stain upon flakes or cells of the medullary rays , its effect upon the mass of wood fibers , and its greater absorption by the open pores or broken cell cavities , are all elements of great surprise that are very interesting and vary with different kinds of wood . 3 . Staining often tones down natural wood colors that are displeasing to the eye . Sometimes only part of a board needs to be changed in color , as in staining a streak or edge of sapwood to match the general color of the rest of the wood . 4 . Sometimes staining is resorted to as a means of giving new wood an aged effect , as in weathered oak . 5 . Greater durability can be obtained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stains made with creosote oil . No other finish is applied over creosote stains . Oil stains , if they contain certain quantities of drying oils such as linseed oil , will protect or preserve wood through the varuishlike film which is left as a covering after the oil has dried . 46 // Definition of Wood Staining . Wood finishers are begining to give a very definite and narrow meaning to the word staining , and , at present , generally exclude all materials that add an opaque pigment to the surface , calling such coatings , which remain largely or partly upon or outside the surface , paints , lacquers , or enamels . With this exclusion in mind , staining is a changing of hue or tone which is due to a chemical reaction or to the application of a liquid that enters to some extent into the interior , and with coloring matter changes the color of a laver of wood near the surface while still allowing the grain with its different cell arrangements to be seen clearly . Staining should leave a transparent effect instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The coloring matter in stains should he in a thoroughly dissolved condition , instead of being in a turbid muddy paste , when it is applied to the wood . Classification of Wood Stains . So many kinds of stains are used for wood that any intelligent and useful classification of them is difficult . The problems which are apt to he met in applying a stain depend to a very large extent upon the solvent which is used to dissolve the coloring matter . For this reason stains are generally classified according to the solvents used in making them . The five classes of stains for wood are : 1 . Water stains. 2 . Oil stains. 3 . Spirit stains. 4 . Non-grain raising stains. 5 . Chemical stains . Two other classes of so-called stains are found on the market : varnish stains and wax stains . These are not transparent , as they obscure the grain and leave a layer of pigment on the surface . ' Wax stains and varnish stains are really in a class midway between true stains and enamels or paints . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasionally suitable for a home repair job where the transparency of the grain of the wood is not considered . Colored varnishes are not popular with expert wood finishers because they always leave muddy , unattractive effects . // The five classes of stain ? water , oil , spirit , chemical , and non-grain raising ? may be subdivided generally into two classes , acid and alkaline , depending upon their chemical reaction with other substances . Water soluble acid stains are very often made of coal-tar dyes , which dissolve in water , and can be used in an acid bath ; or they may he produced from some of the weak acids , such as tannic or pyrogallic , which give little color unless used in connection with an alkali . Chromic acid which comes in red crystals was formerly used ; but on account of its corrosive action , its expense , and uncertain effects , it has largely been replaced by its well-known salt , bichromate of potash . Picric acid which produces a good yellow on wood is also sometimes used with a water soluble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English . The strong acids are little used by the wood finisher . Alkaline stains which were quite commonly used a few years ago were frequently preceded or followed by an acid treatment . A volatile alkali , such as ammonia , or some fixed alkali , like caustic soda , caustic potash , or bichromate of potash , when used alone or in mixtures where practicable , was generally the alkaline element employed in producing the so-called alkaline stains . Water Stains . Many wood finishers consider coloring matter dissolved in water the most satisfactory stain to use on wood . Water passes easily from cell to cell in the growing tree . Wood that has become thoroughly dry will quickly reabsorb moisture ; and , if used in a wet place , it will take up water until its cell walls are at the saturation point ; then , with still more moisture , it will become water soaked as the cell lumina or cavities are gradually filled . This great readiness with which wood absorbs water is very important in wood finishing , and is one reason for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixing with water can now he secured in practically any shade of color desired for making water stains . Formerly , the colors used in mixing water stains were fugitive , and the stains faded ; but , at present , water stains made from acid coal-tar dyes are much more permanent than // spirit stains or water stains made from basic dyes , and also more permanent than oil-soluble dyes . Quite permanent acid coal-tar dyes are at present used almost exclusively in making water stains . Vegetable extracts are still made to some extent from various color-giving woods such as fustic , logwood , Brazilwood , and more recently from the osage orange . The ground-up barks from camwood and ground red sanders are also quoted on the market , and are usually cheaper than the other dyewoods . Advantages of Water Stains . The principal advantages of water stains may be enumerated and discussed briefly as follows : 1 . Water stains penetrate much more deeply into the wood than do either oil or spirit stains . The preliminary treatment for water staining is sponging and resanding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanding removes the broken fragments of cell walls that have become matted into the cell cavities through scraping and sanding . Water stains enter very easily into the open pores of wood that has been sponged and resanded . Wood substance also seems to be more permeable to water than to other solvents used in making stains. 2 . Water stain powders are very soluble , especially in hot water . They generally are moderately soluble in cold water , but for deeper colors hot water is preferable . Some water stains are improved by straining through filter paper or cloth having a fine mesh . 3 . The dipping process can be used safely with water stains , whereas dipping in a spirit or oil stain is dangerous , and greatly increases the fire risk of a building . Many furniture factories have large vats filled with water stains . Chairs , tables , and other articles are completely immersed in the liquid for a short time , and then removed and wiped in order to secure as even a tone as possible . Water stains can also be applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very easy to secure darker or lighter shades and tints with water stains . For a lighter tone all that is necessary is to dilute the stain with water . For darker shades more powder may be added to the stain . In case additional powder // will not dissolve , one or more coats of stain may he put over the first attempt at staining , each application making a darker effect or tone . It is possible to secure very dark or deep effects with water stains. 5 . The color of a water stained article can be changed to a large extent by applying a coat of a different color over a stain that is not suitable or which does not match the required color . Mottled effects or uneven tones of the same color , can be produced by adding color with a brush before the first coat is absolutely dry . A similar effect can usually he produced 1w wetting a water-stained surface with a brush or sponge and then applying more color before the dampened surface dries out . 6 . It is possible and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatear penetration . 7 . The greatest possible variety in colors , shades , and tints is obtainable iii water colors since the advent of water soluble coal-tar dyes . Fewer colors , and less delicate hues , are obtainable in oil and spirit than in water stains. 8 . Permanency , at least Rd to that of other stains , is now secured with coal-tar water stains . Some authorities state positively that coal-tar water soluble stains are more permanent than oil soluble colors of similar origin . A large proportion of all the stains used for wood is now made from aniline and nonaniline dyes which are coal-tar products . The dye manufacturers recommend acid colors that are water soluble coal-tar dyes for use in wood staining , as they are far more permanent in light than are basic colors which are frequently very brilliant , but , unfortunately , quite fugitive . 9 . More transparent , clear effects can be secured with water stains than with any other kind , with the exception of some of the chemical stains , and possibly a few of the volatile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible pigments remain on the surface of the wood to obscure and spoil the beauty of the grain . Clear , brilliant effects can be obtained with water stains which penetrate into the wood fibers and change the color of the wood to an appreciable depth . 10 . Brushes are much more easily cleaned and taken care of when water stain is used , because they can be washed out in water ; while brushes used in oil or spirit stains require // cleaning in turpentine or alcohol , a more expensive and slower process . 11 . In general , water stains are cheaper , gallon for gallon , than any other kind , because the solvent , water , costs less than turpentine , alcohol , and other solvents used to dissolve oil or spirit stains. 12 . Water stains dry quickly . 13 . Water stains will usually penetrate through one coat of linseed oil , or will even darken a filled surface to some extent . The grain is not usually raised appreciably when water stains are applied to surfaces that have already been oiled or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood , however , under such conditions . 14 . After they are applied and allowed to dry properly , water stains do not " bleed " into subsequent finishing coats . Bleeding can often be prevented or eliminated by the application of an intermediate coat of wash shellac or lacquer sanding sealer . Disadvantages of Water Stains . The chief disadvantages of water stains are : 1 . The use of water stains requires sponging and resanding as a preliminary preparation in order to avoid the fuzziness that would appear on the surface of the wood without this treatment . 2 . The extra expense resulting from the sponging and resanding operations adds to the labor cost . 3 . Sandpapering can not be done over a water stained surface without great danger of cutting through the stained layer , leaving streaks or spots of the natural color of the wood which show in a very objectionable manner . If there is fuzz on a water stained surface it is best to apply a wash coat of shellac , using liquid shellac diluted with about seven parts of alcohol . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger , over a coat of thin shellac ; but fine sandpaper ( 3/0 or 4/0 ) should be used , and great care must be taken to avoid cutting through the stain at the corners and other exposed places . The proper procedure is to sponge , allow to dry , and then resand , whenever water stains are to be applied . If this method // is followed little or no sanding will be necessary after staining with water stains. 4 . The use of water in sponging and in the staining process may have a tendency to loosen glued joints . This difficulty can usually be overcome if care is taken to avoid long immersion while dipping , and also through prompt wiping to prevent too great absorption , if the water stain is applied with a brush . The greatest danger comes from using water stains on thin veneers which may loosen at the joints . 5 . It is difficult to apply water stains with a brush and secure an even tone on a large surface . More care and skill are needed in brushing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Water stains dry rapidly , and unless a rather wet brush , full of stain is used , the edge of one brush stroke of stain may dry before the next is put on adjacent to it . The brush strokes should be made with the grain wherever possible . The use of a brush that has little stain in it is to be avoided . Dip the brush in the stain very often , and always before it begins to dry . A large surface may he tipped slightly . In this case , if one begins at the hack of the surface , which should he highest up , and brushes the stain on crosswise , the excess of liquid will run to the lower edge of the brush stroke and keep it wet until the next application of stain is made . Streaks and laps can usually be avoided entirely by this method , if the workman applies the stain rapidly . Another method of avoiding laps is to sponge the article with water and apply the stain to the damp surface . The color is likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but stronger stain can be used safely , or a second application of the coloring liquid can be made after the first coat has dried . 6 . Water stains of the most permanent character , made from coal-tar- dyes , frequently have an acid reaction , and therefore should be kept in glass or earthenware containers when in a liquid form . Brushes with hard rubber ferrules are best because metal bindings on brushes may be affected by acids. 7 . Sapwood streaks are apt to take up too much stain ; and , on sonic of the lighter kinds of wood , they may become // darker than the heartwood . This trouble can largely be avoided by sponging the sapwood with water , thus weakening the absorptive power of that part of the wood ; the stain is then quickly applied evenly over the whole surface . Another method is to use weaker stain on sapwood , which absorbs more color than the rest of the wood and thus becomes too dark . Woods with strong contrast between the sapwood and heartwood , or kinds that are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In such cases the sapwood requires more stain than the remainder of the wood . A coat of stain is applied to the light streaks , and after it dries the entire surface may be stained . Stain may also be put on the sap streaks after the object has been stained as a whole . Blending , by dampening the line at the edge of the sapwood , is often helpful in securing a soft lap . Helpful Hints on Water Staining. 1 . End grain takes too much stain ; consequently it becomes too dark unless care is taken to prevent this extra absorption . The open ends of the tracheal vessels , or the tracheids in some woods , absorb very avidly water and stains in general . Sometimes sponging the end grain , and applying the stain while this part of the wood is wet , will even up the color as it may do on sapwood . Some wood finishers prefer to apply a coat of very thin glue sizing to the end grain and sapwood , after experiments are made to determine the proportions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . End grain usually requires more glue in the sizing mixture than does sapwood . The stain should not be applied until the sizing has dried in the pores of the wood and resanding has been done where necessary . 2 . Knots and different kinds of wood which are laid side by side sometimes require special treatment , but some variation of the methods suggested for end grain and sapwood are ordinarily used . 3 . The end grain of woods with large open pores especially is sometimes treated with a coat of paste wood filler to prevent the stain from soaking in too much . None of the filler // should run over on the faces and edges , or lighter spots or streaks will show where they are not wanted . 4 . Brushes should not be kept standing in water stains , because soaking will cause the bristles to become too soft and " moppy " for good work . They can be washed in water and dried , and thus kept in better condition for future work . A fitch brush about 2 ' , Y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used . Polar bear bristles , which should be rubber set , are also preferred for some kinds of work . A rather soft brush will do good work in staining a close-grained wood ; but , for wood with large open pores , a stiff bristle brush is superior as the bottoms of the cell openings are reached and covered to better advantage . Stiff brushes give a flatter or more even tone than flaccid brushes in staining a porous wood . 5 . A soft brush , if used on wood with large open pores , leaves light specks in the cell cavities because stain thus applied does not penetrate sufficiently into the tiny openings . Glue set brushes can not he used for any length of time in water stains , because the bristles will come out . Either oval or flat brushes are satisfactory , but in any case a rather large size is preferable . On large work a 3 " or 4 " brush should be used , as it holds more stain . 6 . Brushes used in applying water stains should be kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are apt to cause streaks , laps , and an uneven tone . Too wet a brush , which is dripping with stain , will bring trouble through drops falling where stain is not wanted at that time . After dipping the brush into stain , it is best to get rid of any excess wettness l ) v wiping one side of the bristles against the rim of the container , or oo a drip wire placed across the top for that purpose . 7 . Work should be clime rapidly and with great care that stain 111av not 11111 ( ) VC ! ' the edges or drop on surfaces which are to be stained later on . Careless work is apt to leave spots that Xvvill Show alter the staining operation is completed . The workman should also be very careful as to where he places the stain coilaiuer , if he would avoid spots where they are not wanted . 8 . The proper places for beginning and ending , when applying water stain to an article of furniture , are worth consideration before work is begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , if possible . The parts to stain first are the bottom , back , or under portions which are less seen than the front or top of most articles . Hot water stains penetrate deeper and dry faster , both when the dipping process is used and when the stain is applied with a brush . When the dipping process is used the article should remain completely immersed only a moment ; then it should be withdrawn quickly , and after standing on the dripping board for a few moments for the excess stain to run off , the entire piece should be wiped to even the depth of the stain . Veneers are quite apt to appear lighter than solid wood after staining . Usually , a thin stain applied as a second coat to the veneer only will even up the color . Veneer is very thin ; and the glue which is used in gluing it to its place may , to a slight extent , size the surface thus leaving its penetrability reduced more or less . 12 . Creator evenness of tone can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coats of thin stain than by the use of one application of strong color . ' 1'lie second coat lessens any defects of the first , to some extent , and laps or streaks are much fainter than when strong stain is used . Procedure in Applying Water Stain : Apply water stain by any one of several methods ? brushing , wiping , sponging , dip-ping , or spraying . The first and last methods are used most commonly . When applying water stain with a brush , proceed as fol lows : Sponge all surfaces . Allow them to dry and resand care-fully ( Fig. 3-1 ) , page 55 . Select a reasonably stiff nylon brush , two to four inches wide . Determine which parts should be stained first . In gen eral , begin with the most inconspicuous parts , such as the back and the inside of shelves . Fill the brush well with stain . Apply the stain in sweeping strokes with the grain of the wood . Avoid dripping stain on endgrain surfaces ( Fig. 3-2 ) . 56 // Brush rapidly back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry to stain the surface . Refill the brush and apply the stain as before until the entire surface is covered . Remove any excess stain from the brush on the edge of the container or drip wire . Before the stain has set thoroughly , brush out any wet spots until all surfaces assume a dull appearance ( Fig. 3-3 ) . Allow the stain to dry . Water stain air-dries in twelve hours , or force-dries in two to four hours . To avoid excessive penetration on endgrain reduce the strength of the stain with water , or by first sizing all endgrain with a coat of wash shellac or thin glue . Speed in application is essential to successful water stain ing . Speed secures uniform color and helps prevent laps and streaks . Chapter IV Oil Stains There are several kinds of oil stain on the market , each of which is intended for a distinct purpose , and should not be confused with the others . The most distinctive types are : 1 . Pigment stains. 2 . Preservative stains. 3 . Volatile oil stains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in raw linseed oil were formerly Winch used as stains . They can be thinned with turpentine , Or it mixture of turpentine and linseed oil , or even with benzine with a little japan drier . After soaking into the wood fibers for a few minutes , such stains are wiped off and allowed to dry for several clays before any other finishing is attempted . Vandyke brown , burnt and raw sienna , the umbers , ultramarine blue , and yellow ochre are examples of colors ground in oil that can be purchased at any paint shop . Asphaltum black , which is an asphaltum varnish , is another material that can be thinned with turpentine and used as an oil stain . It is permanent when exposed to light and is especially good as a stain for finishing cypress , as it produces a dark brown tone similar to mission oak in color . Dry pigment colors do not dissolve well in turpentine , and are not as satisfactory when used as stains as are colors which are ground in oil . Colors which are ground in oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They produce more brilliant effects in paint than do dry pigment colors , and keep the mixture more liquid so that it will spread better with a brush . When dark pigment colors are used with oil as a stain they 58 // have a covering effect instead of the transparency of water colors . These somewhat opaque results are desired for silver gray or " driftwood " stains . Preparation of Pigment Oil Stains . All pigments ground in oil are not equally permanent when exposed to light . The three primary colors ? red , yellow , and blue ( plus black ) provide nearly any desired tone or hue if you know how to mix colors . The following ready-mixed colors are dependable : Table The above colors are not all equal in chroma or brilliance of hue , some of them being weak in coloring powers A pigment which is low in chroma must be used in a greater amount than is the case where the color is strong and brilliant . On account of the variations in strength of various colors the amount by weight that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following formula is suggestive of the approximate composition of a pigment oil stain for use on the trim of a house or in staining furniture : To each gallon : 1 part boiled linseed-oil 2 parts turpentine 1 to 21/z pounds of pigment colors ground in oil Advantages of Pigment Oil Stains : 1 . They are easily prepared . 2 . They are very easy to apply , because of their slow drying 3 . They do not raise the grain , consequently sponging and resanding are unnecessary , and two operations are saved . 4 . They may be used on thin veneers without danger of loosening the glue . 5 . They are cheaper to apply than water stains , copseSec Chapter VII , pp. 84-85 for definition of such terms as chroma , brilliance , and hue . // quently they are used on cheap furniture , and frequently in house finishing . 6 . They are good to use on the interior of case goods where raising the grain and resanding are difficult . 7 . They generally contain a certain amount of drying oil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin varnish-like film which protects the wood . 8 . A drying oil , such as linseed oil , unless it is bleached , darkens the wood even without being nixed with any colors. 9 . Oil colors can be mixed with wood filler , and this combination stains and fills in one operation . 10 . Oil stains can be used successfully on certain very absorptive woods , such as cypress which becomes very rough and porous when water staining is attempted . 11 . Stains containing a drying oil , such as linseed oil , do not penetrate as deeply into the wood as they do when turpentine is used . Stains with drying oils as the vehicle give an even , flat tone , however , because they do not penetrate unevenly in spots on account of irregular wavy or end grain around or near knots . 12 . Attractive effects can be produced with several of the pigment oil stains on some of the close grained woods , such as poplar , cherry , maple , white pine , and even on walnut which is somewhat porous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stains do not penetrate deeply , and as a result they are easily cut through by sandpaper , or are quickly worn off by use . 2 . Restaining is difficult with oil stains , therefore the proper color must be secured with one coat . ( If the stain is raised with benzine , another darker color can be applied with some success. ) 3 . Oil stain pigments are opaque and remain on the surface to some extent ; they obscure the grain and cause a loss of transparency . 4 . Oil stains are more expensive than water stains , and do not cover as much surface gallon for gallon . 5 . If it is applied too slowly , or if it is not rubbed soon // enough , an oil stain may go into the pores too deeply to dry promptly ; later on , it may ooze out and cause trouble . 6 . Oil stains require several days for proper drying . 7 . Oil stains are likely to " lift " or come off to some extent with a filler . 8 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more limited in number than in water stains. 9 . Oil stains have a tendency to " bleed " into subsequent finishing coats . This is particularly true when applying a lacquer finish . Bleeding can be prevented by applying a coat of wash shellac over the oil stain . Additional drying time will also help eliminate this difficulty . Use of Pigment Oil Stains . The use of pigment oil stains for coloring the wood of furniture has diminished during recent years because better stains have been placed on the market . Oil stains are still in general use for architectural work . It is easier to apply oil stains than water stains on wood used for the inside finish or trim of a house , especially if the wood is nailed in place before the stain is applied . Whenever it is difficult to raise the grain of wood and resand in order to remove the fuzz caused by sponging , it is usually best to color the wood with an oil stain rather than with water stain . Application of Pigment Oil Stains. 1 . Select a suitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stain by brushing with the grain of the wood . Stain the inside corners and recessed surfaces first ( Fig. 4-1 ) . 3 . When staining end grain , wipe immediately to avoid excessive penetration and darkening of the wood . End grain may first be coated with turpentine or linseed oil just before staining. 4 . After the stain dries for a few minutes , wipe all the surfaces with a clean rag to produce an even shade ( Fig. 4-2 ) . 5 . Allow the surface to dry for at least twelve to twenty-four hours . Wiping Stains ( Pigmented Type ) . It is generally best to stain close-grain or soft woods by using pigmented wiping stains which are prepared with a higher percentage of pigments than used in oil stains . These woods do not require as much filling as open-pore woods . Wiping stain will stain and fill , both in one operation . One of the advantages of this stain is that through wiping it emphasizes certain uniformity of figure and character of the grain . Apply pigment wiping stains either by brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in concentration and may be reduced up to 100% with mineral spirits or naphtha depend-ing upon weather conditions . They should be allowed to set from five to ten minutes or until the surface turns dull or gray . Evaporation of the thinner causes this . Control the depth of the color by the amount of stain wiped off . Allow pigmented stains to dry four hours before applying a sealer . Oil stain may be used for this purpose according to the instructions on the label . Creosote Oil Stains . Stains for use out-of-doors are fre-quently made with one of the creosote oils as a vehicle for carrying the coloring matter to the wood . Shingle stains which are made from coal tar creosote , or water gas tar creosote , together with colors are in common use . The shingles are usu-ally clipped for a few minutes , then placed on a draining board to dry . Creosote oil stains are put on for a one coat finish . Paints and varnishes do not adhere properly over creosote oil . // Creosote oil stains can be used best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creosote salts " are likely to settle , leaving part of the stain in a conditon that can not be used . Creosote oil is an excellent preservative of wood from decay fungi , which makes it valuable for outside use . A preservative oil is not really needed for furniture or for the inside finish of a house where the wood is not exposed to dampness . Creosote oil , when used in stains for articles requiring several coats of finish , is harmful when applied to furniture , on account of its dark color , lack of rapid evaporation , and tendency to prevent other finishes from adhering properly . The pigments commonly used in creosote shingle stains are chrome green , and the red and brown iron oxides . A creosote shingle stain contains about 1 ' , pounds of pigment to the gallon , and a vehicle and solvent consisting of 2 parts of creosote oil , 2 parts of heavy benzene , and 1 part of benzene japan drier . Volatile Oil Stains . On the market at present are so-called oil stains which are largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as turpentine , benzol , light and heavy naphthas , and various turpentine substitutes mostly of a mineral nature . These stains , called penetrating stains , are put up in both dry and liquid form and are popular , because they penetrate deeply into the wood and do not require the preliminary treatments of raising the grain and resanding that are so necessary with water stains ; also , because the aniline and other coal-tar dye powders are more soluble than pigment colors , and do not obscure the grain as such colors mixed with drying oils always do to some extent . Volatile oil stains are made in a variety of colors , especially for use on oak , walnut , and mahogany . They should be wiped before they dry in order to produce an even tone , and must he handled with more speed and care than is necessary with ordinary pigment stains , because the solvents used evaporate more rapidly than do the drying oils , such as linseed oil , used with pigment stains or colors ground in oil . Volatile oil stains are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the advantages of pigment oil stains and not many of the disadvantages . // Volatile oil stains sold in a liquid form are apt to contain benzol , at least in part , as a solvent . Benzol and coal-tar dyes are coal-tar products ; and being of a somewhat similar nature chemically , the liquid is an excellent solvent of the powders . Benzol alone is recommended by some manufacturers as a solvent for some of their oil-soluble colors . Many oil-soluble aniline and other coal-tar dry powders sold for oil stains are preferably dissolved in turpentine ; in fact , the manufacturers recommend this solvent . Turpentine substitutes , especially if they contain benzol , can be used siiccessfiilly instead of turpentine . Benzene or benzol , naphtha , gasoline , kerosene , and carbon tetrachloride , are also used as solvents for oil-soluble coal-tar dyes . Permanency of Oil-Soluble Coal-Tar Stains . Some dealers in wood-stains say that aniline and other coal-tar oil and spirit stains fade out more than water-soluble coal-tar dyes do . This statement is especially true , as far as spirit stains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dyes , which manufacturers and chemists admit are not fast to light and permanent , though brilliant when first used . Oil-soluble coaltar dyes now made are often more permanent than basic dyes which are used for spirit stains , and are recommended for use on wood by some reliable manufacturers . Shellac Wash over Volatile Oil Stains . Lifting of the stain by after treatments of filler or shellac is a common fault of volatile oil and spirit stains . Volatile oil stains are not much changed by a filler , however , if a thin coat of shellac , mixed in the proportion of one part of liquid shellac to seven or eight parts of alcohol , is applied over the stain and allowed to dry before filling . Shellac in its full strength from the can should not be used on porous woods that require a filler until after the filling is finished . A very thin shellac coat , called a shellac wash , may be used over a stain without filling the pores to such an extent that a filler will not have proper anchorage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly over any of the oil stains without probable loss in clearness of tone , because the solvents used in all cases are the same or similar . Some of the coloring matter may be " lifted " and mixed with the varOil // nish coat , thus producing a muddy or cloudy effect , and a loss of transparency . Volatile oil stains , especially those containing benzol as a solvent , penetrate very deeply into the wood in comparison to pigment oil stains , and do not dry as readily as is indicated by appearances on the outside . It is best to allow at least 24 hours for drying before a shellac wash is applied over a volatile oil stain . Sometimes , in order to secure certain tone or color effects , the shellac wash is omitted between the coats of stain and filler . In all cases , in order to prevent " bleeding " of the coal tar oil stains into the varnish-coats , it is important that one or more coats of shellac be applied to the stained or stained and filled wood before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Non-Grain-Raising Stains Characteristics of Spirit Stains . Colors or dyes used today are almost entirely spirit-soluble basic coal-tar dyes . Spirit stains dry fast , and do not penetrate deeply into the wood . baps , streaks , and brush marks are likely to disfigure any large surface stained with spirit stain . The trouble is due entirely to the rapid evaporation of the alcohol which is used as the solvent for the colors . Spirit stains are more expensive than water stains , because the solvent , alcohol , costs much more than water . Spirit stains are sometimes used for quick work , especially for touching up spots and streaks , and in making repairs or renewing old finishes . The expert can occasionally use them to advantage , but the beginner always has trouble with them . Another difficulty with spirit stains is that they may " lift " with the filler coat , or with the application of shellac which is a spirit varnish cut with alcohol . Such stains are liable to mix with the shellac under the brush , and produce a muddy effect which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spirit Stains and Volatile Oil Stains . Some manufacturers of spirit stains have changed their formulas , and do not use alcohol exclusively as a solvent . Turpentine and benzol are sometimes used as solvents or thinners in addition to alcohol , and these oils slow down the rapidity of drying of the spirit stain . Benzol also causes the stain to penetrate more deeply than if alcohol alone is used . These stains can be thinned with either alcohol or turpentine , but turpentine is preferable on account of its slower evaporation . Some of the best liquid stains on the market today are 66 // really a combination of volatile oil and spirit stains , and these mixtures are giving very satisfactory results though they are rather expensive on account of the high cost of the solvents . Water is also sometimes used as a thinner for spirit stains , reducing the rapidity of drying . Evaporation and Fire Risk . Spirit stains can not be left in open vats in factories on account of the rapid evaporation of the solvents used , and because this practice would increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tightly-closed glass bottles . Method of Application . More even tones and brilliant ef fects can be obtained from spirit stains by wiping and spread ing any excess of color soon after the dye is applied with a brush . The best results are secured ( 1 ) by working rapidly with a brush loaded with color , rather than with an almost dry brush ; and ( 2 ) by evening up , by wiping before the stain has set or dried . Spirit Stains Fade . Spirit stains made from aniline or other coal-tar dyes are considered by many experts to be the most fugitive of all stains , although they are much more permanent than they were a few years ago . Their tendency to fade , and difficulty in application , have caused them to be used much less than are either water or oil stains . Spirit stains are made from basic coal-tar dyes which the manufacturers know to be fugitive . Where a temporary brilliant effect is desired , and fastness to light is not a requisite , such stains may be used to advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fresh colors should not be exposed to bright light until after coats of shellac and varnish have been applied . Such impervious finishes keep out the air and prevent fading to a large extent . Non-Grain-Raising Stains . ' During recent years these stains have helped revolutionize finishing procedures and techniques . They are becoming increasingly popular , since in addition to other advantages , they show a minimum tendency to raise the grain of wood . Essentially N.G.R. ( non-grain-raising ) stains are made // from light-fast dyes soluble in non-aqueous vehicles . The sol vent used is usually a mixture of one of the " glysol " group solvents , plus an alcohol , such as methanol . To these a coal-tar Itv drocarbon is added , usually toluol . Solvents such as carbitol , cellosolve , and ketones are also used . The composition of the N.G.R. solvent is very important and manttfacturcrs have done much research on it . It is the correct adjustment of this solvent mixture that very much determines the performance of an N.G.R. stain . Itt their various forms of preparation N.G.R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stain . Yielding 1nri ht , Iraisparcnt , and light-resistant effects , they can be Uninitiated so that they are non-toxic and have little or no odor . In some instanMMS certain precautions must be taken in their application . N.G.II. stains are supplied by the manufacturer either as concentrated base colors or mixed ready for use . Some finishers prefer to buy the base colors and make mixed stains by their own formulas . A stain reducer accompanies the base colors . The majority of users , however , prefers to buy the stains ready mixed so that they can be brushed or sprayed on directly from the container . N.G.R. stains have all the important advantages of other stains without their disadvantages . Containing the same dye powders , they are equal in brightness and light fastness . Dye colors may be blended and reduced with proper solvents to the desired strength . These stains are fast drying . In fact , because of the ve hicles used , brushing is difficult . Spraying is the ideal method of application . As their name implies , they do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This eliminates the labor and expense of wash coating and sanding . Penetration into the wood surface is uniform and moderately deep , assuring greater and more uniformly clear color tones . Soft streaks can be matched readily . The solvents used in N.G.R. stains are compatible with most sealers and subsequent finish coats . Although the initial cost of these stains is higher than that // of water stains , it is offset by the elimination of the steps of wash coating and sanding . The use of N.G.R. stains has not only reduced the number of operations previously required , but actually raised the quality of finishes by eliminating bleed ing and other difficulties associated frequently with the older types of stain . Special Problems in Staining . ' The inexperienced writer of stories has difficulty in deciding on " how to start " or " where to start " the writing . The novice in wood finishing has sim ilar problems , and must decide which parts should be stained first . In general , it is best to begin with the most inconspicu ous or least important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts that are most often seen . On vertical surfaces it is best to start at the top and work downward , usually with the grain . The article to be stained should be placed , whenever possible , so that no stain will drip or spatter onto an important surface , because spots will not always blend out . This trouble with spots may be serious , if the dye or color drips onto unstained portions of the article ; and it is equally or more bothersome when drops fall upon surfaces already stained . Spots are not usually so troublesome with oil stains as with other kinds . Placing the surface in an inclined position , with the opera-tor standing at the lower long edge , and brushing from left to right , or lengthwise of the grain of the wood , are frequently helpful in preventing streaks and laps ( Fig. 5-I ) . The brush for staining should , in general , be kept quite full of stain , but must not be wet enough to drip . Part of the liquid can be removed from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can , or by using the side of the container itself to press out the excess of stain . The inside and shelves of cases , hacks of legs , under side of arms of chairs , and other parts that will be seen but little should be stained first . Use of Brushes and Wiping . The brushes must generally be handled with care to prevent the stain from running over edges , and to avoid the drying of portions of a surface before it is entirely covered . It is best to apply the stain lengthwise or // vith the grain of the wood rather than across the grain . A latter , more even tone can be secured by brushing lengthwise , ! specially on open-grained or porous woods , because the ) ristles of the brush get down into the low places of the cell umina or openings more satisfactorily when the stain is tpplied with the grain . Most stains must be rubbed or wiped ) ff with some absorbent material , such as cotton waste ( Fig. -2 ) . It is often best to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiping rubs the stain into the pores , and he lengthwise rubbing cleans off any excess and evens up he color . Speed in Staining . Speed in applying the coloring liquid s fundamental to success with most stains . Speed secures iniform color and helps in preventing laps and streaks . The // amount of speed required varies with the kinds of stain used , depending upon the rapidity of the evaporation of the sol vents which hold the coloring matter in solution . Spirit stains containing alcohol evaporate with astonishing rapidity . Vola tile oil stains vary greatly in rapidity of drying ; those con taining gasoline evaporate almost instantly ; while , if turpentine is used as a solvent , vaporization is much slower . The manufacturers of the best volatile oil stains in liquid form ordinarily use solvents which will control the rapidity of drying and slow down the evaporation to practical workable limits . Pigment oil stains contain a certain amount of drying oil , such as raw linseed oil , and this makes them dry slowly . There is no difficulty in applying pigment oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact , that no other finish should be placed over them for several clays . Chapter VI Chemical Stains Some years ago certain forms of chemical stain enjoyed quite a little popularity . White oak was a suitable material for the manufacture of mission furniture which was then in vogue , and this wood with its high tannic-acid content lent itself admirably to several chemical stains , the most satisfactory of which was produced by the ammonia fuming process . Other acid and alkaline stains were used with some success , and writers of that period predicted a great future for chemical stains . The most popular stains of the present day are the result of chemical discoveries , but they are synthetic dyes instead of true chemical stains in the sense that the term is usually used by the wood finisher . Definition of Chemical Stains . In a scientific sense , chemical stains depend upon some chemical reaction in the wood resulting in the formation of new colored compounds . One of the chemicals is sometimes contained in the wood itself . In other cases one chemical may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbed or produce some chemical change . Later on , another chemical which may be in the form of a gas or liquid , may come in contact with the first and bring about a chemical change in the wood itself , thereby causing a change in color . True chemical staining , therefore , is the result of chemical action in the wood which produces a new color . Often chemical staining depends upon the changing of coloring matter already in the wood to a new or different color , because of a chemical reaction , rather than to the application of a dye or pigment . Woods differ greatly in their chemical composition ; consequently they react very differently to chemical treatment . Waning Popularity of Chemical Stains . Oak , which years 72 // ago was so much used for furniture , has partly been replaced by other woods which are not so easily stained by chemical processes . Another reason for the decline of chemical staining is that a uniform tone can not usually be secured on an article of furniture , even when made of oak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of staining . This unevenness is clue to the fact that sapwood is not changed to a tone to match heartwood , and boards from different trees do not take equal amounts of color . Considerable " doctoring " of spots and streaks was a common aftermath of chemical staining . Some factories gradually came to the practice of giving a light chemical stain , following this treatment with a water-soluble or other coal-tar dye coating to even up the color and produce a flat uniform tone . The hardest blow of all to chemical stains came from the great improvements in coal-tar dyes that are as permanent as any stains . These synthetic dyes are very convenient to use , and last , but not least , they can be found in almost any color , shade , and tint desired . Chemicals Used in Staining . Chemical stains are generally acid or alkaline in reaction . A combination of the two is usual in producing colors that have been most popular recently . Acid stains are very conrrnonly dependent upon either tannic or pyrogallic acid as a base , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not often used . Acetic acid has been tried , but its benefit is quite doubtful . Chromic acid and salts are useful in connection with alkalies and other stains , and emphasize or brighten the resultant colors . Picric acid is useful where a decided yellow is desired , and can be used in connection with acid water-soluble coal-tar colors , such as nigrosine , in producing Early English and other dyes . Such chemicals as sugar of lead , potassium chromate , and magnesium sulphate , are valuable in use with acid aniline and other coal-tar colors . Tannic acid used in connection with other substances produces interesting , valuable , and sometimes troublesome colors . When it is used in connection with iron salts and ammonia , a ferric ammonium tannate having a blue-black or olive-green color is formed . This combination is occasionally used as a wood stain . It sometimes appears unexpectedly where it is not // wanted , if tannic acid is used in contact with iron , as in a tin can . Sulphate of iron in dried form and chloride of iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gray arc the result . The water-soluble coal-tar dye called nigrosine can be used with tannic acid alone or with iron salts added . A still different color can be secured by applying a five-percent solution of tannic acid and water , and following with a weak solution of logwood extract in hot water which may be mixed with various amounts of copper sulphate in a five-percent solution . The tannins are complex compounds , and vary in composition depending upon their origin . Solutions of tannins in water are liable to absorb oxygen from the air and change in composition . The action is rapid with alkaline solutions . For this reason mixtures containing tannic acid should be made up fresh . Solutions of tannic acid and water , if kept in a covered glass jar or bottle , will remain in good condition for several days . Various alkalies are used to produce stains on wood . Frequently the alkalies are applied following an acid treatment and react with the acid to produce a new color . One of the most satisfactory chemicals to use in staining is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proportion of one quart of water to a half ounce of the crystals . It makes a yellowish or golden brown stain , and is sometimes used with vegetable mahogany dyes , and also with carbonate of potash or soda following a treatment of tannic acid , thus making an orange brown color . Coniferous woods , such as pine , and many of the broad leafed hardwoods , contain little tannin and should not be stained with potassium bichromate , because the stain which shows at first will fade unless there is a union with tannin to form a tannate and produce a color that is permanent and brown in tone . Potassium permanganate crystals dissolved in various proportions in cold water make another useful chemical stain . The crystals are of a violet hue , and make a solution of a similar color . The liquid should be sponged on the wood because the permanganate will soon destroy a bristle brush . The wood will have a violet tone when the solution is first // applied , but this gradually changes to an interesting brown , which varies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood . Darker shades can be secured by the use of more than one coat , just as with water stains . The lignocellulose of which wood is composed gradually and sometimes rapidly reacts with the potassium permanganate , leaving a brown deposit of hydrated manganese dioxide . Volatile and fixed are the two types of alkalies that are used in chemical staining . Strong ammonia ( 26 ? ) in a solution of water is the volatile alkali found effective for staining , while the fixed alkalies are represented by caustic potash or caustic soda , and by potassium bichromate , copper sulphate , and potassium carbonate . Necessary Precautions When Using Chemical Stains . Brushes , preferably of the type called rubber-set , are generally used in applying stains to wood . For coarse woods rather stiff bristles are needed to force the stain down into the open pores . Strong alkalies and some of the acids may affect the bristles and soon ruin a brush . Some of the alkalies in common use that affect brushes to some extent , especially when used in strong solution , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbonates . A brush can not he used with any of the strong acids . Weak acids in common use , such as tannic acid and pyrogallic acid , can be applied successfully with a rubber-set brush . The brushes should be cleaned with water and allowed to dry when not in use . Brushes made of vegetable fibers instead of bristles can be used in staining wood . When a sponge is used in applying a chemical stain , the hands are apt to become badly stained , or the skin may be eaten out in tender spots such as the backs of the fingers and under the nails . Cylinder oil , or some other mineral oil , vaseline , or similar heavy grease , may be coated over the hands in such a manner as to protect them from weak acids or alkalies when using a sponge to apply stains . For best protection , wear rubber gloves ( Fig. 6-1 ) , page 76 . Preparation of the Surface Before Applying Chemical Stain . The same care must be used in preparing the surface of wood for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and II . All glue must be carefully removed , or light spots will appear about or under the adhesive . // Fumed Oak Color with Fixed Alkalies . A color very much like that produced on white oak by fuming with ammonia can be obtained on certain varieties of oak , chestnut , ma-hogany , gum , pine , and some other woods , by preparing the surface with a tannic acid or pyrogallic acid solution , and later on giving a coat of fixed alkalies in an aqueous solution instead of fuming . The procedure is as follows : Raise the grain by sponging with water , allow to dry , and resand . Coat the wood with No. 1 solution , made up of 1 oz. tannic acid powder in one quart of water ; or 1/3 oz. pyrogallic acid powder in one quart of water . ( The solutions may be mixed in these proportions in any quantity . ) Allow the wood to dry . Sand lightly with No. 000 sandpaper . Apply a coat of No. 2 solution , made up of : 1 quart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oz. caustic potash. // 5 . When dry , rub with diluted linseed oil , made up of : 1 part boiled linseed oil , 3 parts turpentine . On white oak the above procedure will produce a color almost identical with that obtained by ammonia fuming . It is very important , however , that each of the two solutions shall be thoroughly worked into the wood . A stiff , rather coarse , rubber bound bristle brush is best . On porous woods , such as oak , the stain solutions may not be forced well down into the open pores unless the brush is kept quite wet , and applied with vigorous strokes with the grain . Unless care is taken in applying the solutions , many light specl:s will show in the open pores where the solutions did not penetrate properly . Stains produced by acids and fixed alkalies penetrate about as deeply as water stains , while those obtained by the fuming process with ammonia are better in that they enter into the wood much more deeply . A slightly different , but pleasing color , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No. 2 solution a mixture of about one ounce of bichromate of potash to the quart of water . The latter solution seems to be more effective when applied quite warm . A lighter tint of brown is obtained by using part carbonate of potash instead of all bichromate of potash in the solution . The Ammonia Fuming Process . The fuming process has been much used to produce a rich brown tone on white oak commonly known as fumed oak . Chestnut is another wood that is quickly and beautifully stained by this process because it contains a large amount of tannin in a form that readily reacts with ammonia gas . These chemicals quickly change the surface of this wood to a dark rich brown hue when fumed and rubbed with linseed oil . Certain other American woods can be changed in color to some extent by the fuming process . Walnut and mahogany may be browned by fuming because they contain quite a little tannin . Doubtless some of the foreign woods that contain an unusual amount of tannin can be fumed successfully . The woodworker should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be stained by this process , for the former // does not react to ammonia as readily as the latter , since it contains much less tannin . A chemical reaction takes place when ammonia gas unites with tannic acid , and a new compound is formed called ammonium tannate which is of a rich reddish or yellowish brown color . Success in fuming wood to produce stain comes from technical knowledge and proper equipment . The finisher must know what woods can be fumed , and how to prepare and treat them before and after fuming . The Fuming Process on White Oak . White oak , the wood that is most commonly used when the fuming process is attempted , requires proper preliminary treatment . Fuming a finished and sanded article made of white oak may seem disappointingly slow . ft can be hastened by sponging with water before putting the article in the fuming box . The sponged wet wood can the fumed at once and sanded later on after removal from the box , or it can be dried and resandcd to remove the fuzz and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water opens up the pores and speeds up the chemical action of the ammonia fumes . Weak solutions of tannic or pyrogallic acid , or a mixture , applied to the surface of the wood , will greatly speed up the fuming process . For the mixture of tannic acid , use one ounce of tannin powder to one quart of water ; for the pyrogallic acid solution , which will produce a more reddish brown than can he secured from tannin alone , the mixture should be weaker , in general , with about % oz. of pyrogallic acid powder to the quart of water . A mixture of the two solutions is excellent , and produces a color in the final finish slightly different from that produced by either acid used alone . None of the above mixtures should be put in tin containers , or a blue-black color will result from the action of the acid on iron . Glass or earthen containers and rubber-set brushes should always be used . Sapwood streaks and boards from different trees are brought to a much flatter and even tone by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This reduces the amount of " blending in " with stain to color the light places to the general tone of the piece . Wood that has been treated with one // of the acid mixtures has a more uniform acid content on the treated surfaces , and after fuming has a much less varying and more even tone . The Fuming Box . A fuming box is the special article required for staining with ammonia . Large factories use a specially-built , practically air-tight room , which has an outside window for ventilation , to clear out the gas fumes as soon as possible , and to keep them from other parts of the factory . Of the various ways of introducing the ammonia gas into the fuming chamber or box , the simplest and commonest is to use aqua ammonia in concentrated form , which is known to the druggist as varying from 26 to 35.7 per cent in strength . It should have a specific gravity between .906 and .880 , the latter being the strongest of all . Household ammonia is too weak to secure good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tank and allowed to run into one shallow pan after another by slowly dripping . The ammonia gas is gradually liberated leaving water in the pans . A fuming box for the school shop can easily be built by students , using matched lumber , and making the tight or face joints on the inside of the box . A practical size is about 4 ' x 4 ' x 8 ' , as such a box will take a table , or any other article of furniture which is apt to be made in a school shop . A removable partition should be placed so as to make two boxes of about 4 ' x 4 ' x 4 ' , as one box of this size is ample for most school work , and less ammonia is required for a small box . About pint of strong ammonia ( 26 ? or 28 ? ) is required to charge the box . The inside of the box may be papered to close up the small cracks . The doors of the box should be fitted so that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Articles to be fumed must be placed in such a way that the ammonia gas can reach all the surfaces to be stained . If one article is laid upon another , the gas will not properly color the surfaces that are in contact , and light unstained places will be the result . All surfaces that are to be stained should be separated . Small articles can be leaned against the sides of the box in such a way that all surfaces will be exposed . Ammonia can be poured into a large flat dish or pan which is placed near the door on the bottom of the box . In pouring out the ammonia care must be taken not to splatter the liquid on // any of the articles , or disagreeable spots that can not be removed will be the result . A person should be careful not to breathe the fumes of ammonia when charging the box . Time Required for the Fuming Process . The length of time required for fuming to a given shade of brown varies with a number of conditions , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the strength of the ammonia , and the size and tightness of the box . In a commercial fuming room , in which concentrated ammonia drips from one warmed pan to another , articles of white oak that have been sponged with a tannic or pyrogallic solution , as described in a previous paragraph , will fume in about twelve hours . In the box described for the school shop , furniture treated with a tannin solution will fume in about 18 to 24 hours from ammonia in a flat pan . II the surface of the wood is simply sponged with water to open up the pores instead of being treated with one of the above acids , the time for fuming is generally doubled . Articles made of chestnut will usually fume in about one-half the time required for white oak . Chestnut wood does not usually require the preliminary coat of tannic acid ; and care must be taken , or the color will be too dark . Testing for Color . The color of filmed wood is not a rich brown when it comes from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weathered fence post . A test for color can be made by wetting the finger or a piece of waste with linseed oil and touching the wood in some inconspicuous place . The oil will instantly change the gray to the rich brown color so much admired . If the resultant color after application of the oil to a small spot is too light , the article can be returned to the fuming box and refumed by adding new ammonia . If the color is too dark , allow the article to stand a few weeks before oiling , and let it fade out . To avoid opening a fuming box before the fuming process is completed , some operators use a sample piece of the same kind of wood , prepared in the same manner , which is inserted through a small opening in the box , and removed for testing . After removal from the box , the fumed surfaces should be sanded lightly with No. 000 sandpaper . The stain penetrates quite deeply into the wood , much deeper than water stain ; // therefore , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streaks or spots . Reasonable care should be taken on the corners . Securing Uniform Results . Sap streaks and light spots are a bugbear to the wood finisher who uses the fuming process . Boards taken from different trees of the same species vary in the amount of tannin content ; consequently , an article made from several hoards will be uneven in color , or tone at least , after the fuming process . Various methods of blending or touching up are used to secure a more uniform tone . One of the best procedures for correcting the trouble is to " blend in " a fumed oak water stain of a color similar to that of the darker parts of the article . The line of demarcation between the light and dark tones should be dampened with a soft brush and water , and before this dries the stain in diluted form should he applied to the lighter areas . The same process may be repeated , if necessary , to secure a still darker tone over any portion of a surface . When whole boards or large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the darker parts may be covered with diluted linseed oil ; the lighter parts may be coated with the tannin solution a second time ; refuming will greatly darken the unoiled portions and only slightly affect the oiled wood . Some finishers prefer a stain made of bichromate of potash and water-soluble jet black . Only a little of the jet black is needed to give a brownish tone . The hiclhrornate of potash is a fixed alkali , and , with tannic acid , produces on oak a color similar to that secured by the volatile alkali , ammonia . This staining process can be repeated , if necessary . It is a little easier to tell what the resultant colors are going to be if the surface containing the uneven tones is moistened with naphtha and allowed to dry before applying the bichromate of potash solution . Colored shellac may also be used if the article has already been shellacked and shows an uneven tone . The shellac should be thin , and the amount of color added must not be great , or the effect will be muddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion may be too ( lark . Use the following mixture if it is necessary to add a considerable amount of color : // 3z pint liquid white shellac , 1/i pint denatured alcohol , with 14 oz . Bismarck brown spirit soluble aniline dye dissolved in it , 1/2 pint denatured alcohol , with ' oz. ( or less ) of alcohol soluble black dye . Each solution should be mixed separately before pouring together , gradually adding the black solution , until the correct color is obtained . Other spirit soluble colors may be used to produce a more accurate tone when applied to the light portions . The chief objections to this method of evening up tones are that spirit soluble stains are somewhat fugitive , and the grain is obscured . The effect is like that produced with varnish stains . Oiling with boiled linseed oil is the next step after sanding and staining sap streaks , and this brings out the real color which is clear and transparent with no pigment to obscure the beauty of the grain . The oil should ho diluted with about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmed or heated can be used to great advantage , but it dries very slowly , and slows up the finishing process . The diluted boiled linseed oil penetrates the wood deeply and leaves no gum or residue in places that are difficult to rub . Better results can be obtained by giving the fumed wood two or more coats instead of one of the diluted boiled oil , rubbing it well into the wood first with an oil-soaked pad and later with dry or nearly dry rags , waste , or other cleaning material . The oil should be allowed to dry two- or three clays between coats , and even longer , if possible , before any other finish is applied over it . Procedure for Fumed Oak Finish . The steps in finishing an article of white oak , in chronological order , are as follows : 1 . Raise the grain of the wood , by sponging the surface with water . Allow it to dry . 2 . Resand the entire sponged surface , to remove all fuzz . 3 . Apply a coat of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tannic acid powder to the quart of water . ( Use part or all pyrogallic acid solution for a more reddish tone . ) If none of these acids is at hand , open the pores by sponging with water , and fume longer . 4 . Furue in a tight filming box or room for 6 to 48 hours , // depending upon the box , the strength of the ammonia , the wood used , and the shade of brown desired . Use approxi mately % pint of 26 ? ammonia in charging a box having 64 cubic feet of space . Test for color with a spot of oil in an inconspicuous place on the article . Another coat of tannin solution may be applied and the article refumed for a darker color . Stain all sap streaks to even up the color . Slightly stain any boards or portions that are too light . Sand the surfaces lightly with No. 000 sandpaper . Apply one or two coats of diluted boiled linseed oil ( 1 part oil to about 3 parts turpentine ) . Allow two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil after applying it , and remove all excess with dry waste or rags . Shellac with diluted denatured alcohol shellac , consist ing of 2 parts liquid white shellac , ' , s part orange shellac , and 1 to 2 parts denatured alcohol . The shellac should dry from 8 to 24 hours . Use fresh shellac only . Sand very carefully with No. 000 sandpaper . Apply at least two coats of floor wax , and rub to a polish about 15 minutes after each waxing . Instead of waxing , some finishers prefer to varnish over the shellac coat with a flat or dull varnish for the last process . Varnish should not be put over wax without removing the wax with gasoline . Chapter VII Colors and Their Application Colors Used in Wood Staining . The colors which are most commonly used by the wood finisher are red , orange , green , brown , and black . Other colors in combination are frequently pit together , often shading into neutral grays . Yellows and blues , while not used in the finishing room in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Definitions of Terms . A statement of the meanings of hue , chronic , lint , shade , and other terms , as used by the discriminating colorist , be of help to the wood finisher. line is frequently used in the sense of color , as red , yellow , and so on . It is also employed in referring to a i ; arialion of a color as a result of mixing a shall quantity of another color with it . Thus we say that the lines of blue spread out toward the violet blues on one side , and toward the green blues on the other . To the scientist , hue means a color of a definite wave length . Chroma refers to the strength , brilliancy , or intensity of a color . We can say that chrome yellow is a brilliant color of high chroma ; or that it is a strong color , while yellow ochre is a dull color of weak chroma . Colors lose in chroma or intensity as a result of being neutralized or grayed . Shade refers to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a broader sense the term shade is commonly used to include the tints of lighter steps of a color , as well as the darker effects . The shade of a color in its exact meaning refers to a spectral or brilliant color to which black has been added , thus lowering it in tone . A tint of a color is a lighter effect produced by adding white to an oil color or water to a transparent stain . A tint is lighter and more delicate than the standard color , which is the spectral hue . 84 // The value of a color refers to its position in a scale from dark to light . The tints and shades are therefore various values of the color itself . Black or white may be mixed with a color , and a change of value is the result ; but there is no change in the hue or color itself . Tone refers to the general effect , as " painted in dark tones " means that the effect is dark . Tone has reference to the degree of luminosity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adding black or white to a normal color changes its tone . Saturation of a color refers to its purity , or to the amount of white light which is contained in the color . White in the form of pigments , of course , has no hue and no saturation . Warne colors are the fire colors represented by red , orange , and yellow . Red is sometimes called a hot color . Cold colors are the ice colors of blue , and its neighbors in the spectrum , green and violet . A yellow-green may be called a warm green , and in the same sense a red-violet is a warm violet . Colors of the Prismatic Solar Spectrum . White light or sunlight is composed of seven prismatic colors , since the time of Newton who pointed out this fact in the year 1666 . When a beam of white sunlight is passed through a prism , refraction breaks it up into a band which shows the seven colors of the rainbow , namely : red , orange , yellow , green , blue , indigo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors , however , for they can be produced by mixing other colors together . The Three Primary Colors . For many years red , yellow , and blue have been called the primary colors because it was thought that they can not be made by mixing pigment colors together . A statement of this fact is found in the writings of Aristotle who lived about 2300 years ago . The name primary colors still clings to red , yellow , and blue , although now these so-called primaries can be made by mixing colors adjacent to them on the color circle . Walter Sargent says that red can be made by mixing violet and orange ; that blue can be made by mixing green and violet ; and that yellow can be produced by a mixture of orange and green . The three so-called primary colors which are produced lry mixtures of adjacent colors on the color circle are what most people call tertiary colors . They are dull and low in bril86 Coloring , Finishing , and Painting Wood liancy , and appear like bright colors that have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have brilliant reds , blues , and yellows to start with , and then to make the other colors , considering the three hues just named as base , fundamental , or primary colors . Secondary Colors . Red , yellow , and blue pigments when mixed together in pairs produce new hues called secondary colors . Red and yellow make orange ; yellow and blue produce green ; and red and blue give violet . The above refers to mixing of pigments or dyes , and not to combining colored lights . Sargent tells us that blue and yellow lights blended together produce white ; and that disks of the same colors when rotated produce gray ; while pigments of a similar blue and yellow when mixed as stains or paints produce green . The artist and mixer of paint or stain should keep these facts in mind and not be confused by the many color theories of the scientist who works with lights rather than with pigments . The artist or wood finisher who mixes pigments or dyes in making other colors considers red , yellow , and blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and violet are regarded as the secondary colors . Some writers and colorists use the term purple in place of violet ; generally , the colors purple and violet are considered to be the same or nearly so . Tertiary Colors . By mixing the secondary colors , orange , green , and violet , in pairs we have a new series of Ines known as olive , citrine , and russet , called tertiary colors . Orange and green mixed in the right proportion produce citrine ; green and violet make olive ; and orange and violet combine into russet . In mixing colors for citrine , which is also called citron , four parts of orange and one part of green are required . Olive is made from four parts of green to one part of violet . Russet is obtained by taking four parts of orange and one part of violet . Quaternary Colors . The quaternary colors are obtained by mixing together the tertiary colors in pairs . By combining pigments of citrine and russet we have buff ; russet and olive produce plum ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many other colors can be produced by mixing primary , secondary , and tertiary colors together in various proportions . The color which results from any mixture depends upon the aroma or brilliancy of the primary colors // used as the original pigments , and also upon whether black or white has been added . The strength of the color can sometimes be changed by dilution with various liquids , as by adding water to water colors or turpentine to oil stains . Neutral Colors . Black and white , while not colors in the ordinary sense , are known as neutral colors . They can be used for contrasting effects with any of the other colors and make a color harmony . Black and white are often mixed with any of the colors to make tints and shades . When mixed together they make a gray . Any color can be neutralized or changed to a neutral gray by adding a sufficient amount of its complemen-tary color . The Color Circle . Many authorities on colors arrange twelve of the colors of the spectrum in a circle using red , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with intermediate or half steps between . This plan enables one to select approximately color harmonies in triads as well as with opposites on the circle ( Fig. 7-1 ) . // Complementary Colors . Effects that can he produced by mingling or blending lights can not be reproduced by mixing pigments . The complementary colors in the two cases are not exactly the same . The pigment-complement of any hue can be found by what is Known as the after-image . One method of seeing the color of an after-image is as follows : ( 1 ) Select a piece of bright colored paper , as yellow ; ( 2 ) Make a tube of dart : paper , or use one land as a tube to cut off the surrounding light , and look through one of these " telescopes " at the colored paper for some time , as half a minute or until the eye becomes tired ; ( 3 ) While still looking through the tube , remove the paper or look at a white background . An after image of the complementary color will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but definite line . If one looks at yellow paper through the tube until the eye is somewhat tired , as suggested , the afterimage which appears on a white background is a violet or possibly a blue-violet color . Violet is opposite to yellow on the color circle and is called the complementary color of yellow . The pigment-complement of a color is the color which mixed with it produces a neutral gray . The approximate complement of any pigment color can be found by looking at the opposite ends of any diameter on the color circle , ( Fig. 7-1 ) ; thus , green is complementary to red ; violet is complementary to yellow ; orange is complementary to blue ; yellow-orange is the complement of blue-violet , and so on . Contrasts . Effective contrasts can be secured by using black or white adjacent to a color , or by placing complementary colors side by side . A neutral gray can also be used with colors if a less striking or more subdued contrast is wanted . One or both of two complementary colors may be omitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color circle substituted for the broken-up hue , in order to produce more subtle or delicate contrasts . An illustration of broken-up colors can often be seen in the morning or evening sky , at sunrise or sunset , where the clouds vary from red-orange to orange and then to yelloworange , and all are contrasted with blue which also may vary . Color Triads . An equilateral triangle of the proper size , so that the three points of the angles just touch the circumference of a color circle , when the triangle is placed over the circle , // will divide the color ring into three equal parts . The points of the triangle will , in any position that it is placed , point to three colors that are approximately harmonious , because any two mixed together will produce the complement of the third color . In Fig. 7-2 , O-V-G represents a triad or three-color harmony with contrasting colors . The triangle B-YO-RO , which is shown in clotted lines , represents a color , blue , with its near-comple ments yellow-orange and red-orange . The use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing softer and more delicate contrasts that are often of great beauty . A very great number of interesting color combinations can be discovered by shifting the triangle in Fig. 7-2 about the color circle . If the equilateral triangle is placed with corners at Y-R-R , we have a combination of the three primary colors , which is the least pleasing of the harmony groups made by placing the triangle over the color circle . Another pleasing combination , recommended by some art ists , is made by the use of a triangle with three , four , and five steps on the sides , as shown at R-BV-YG , in Fig. 7-2 . Triads // containing one of the so-called primary colors can be used in such a combination without the unpleasant group of the three primary colors . In some cases two of the primary colors , such as blue and red , may be included in a triad . If the 3-4-5 triangle in Fig. 7-2 is revolved one step counterclockwise , a color triad with yellow , red-violet , and blue will be the result . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed rules as to just what colors are pleasing when they are placed together . Each color has an unlimited number of variations changing toward the adjacent hue on each side of it on the color circle . Each hue has many values which may be produced by dark and light , or by mixture of black and white . The chroma or intensity of colors varies from full brilliancy to neutral gray . The texture of the material to which the color is applied gives different effects of light and dark as well as of tone and of reflection . Color harmony , in general , can be secured : ( 1 ) by a careful selection of the proper hues , either analogous , or related , or in contrast ; ( 2 ) by having one color dominant ; ( 3 ) by having the colors selected and arranged for a tone balance ; ( 4 ) by considering lights and darks of the hues or shades and tints ; ( 5 ) by varying the chroma , or partially neutralizing one or both of the colors ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ texture of the material or surface upon which they are to be applied . Analogous and Contrasting Colors . There are two types of color harmonies , which are known as analogous and contrasting harmonies . Analogous colors are closely related colors , or those that are adjacent to each other on the color circle . An example of a group of analogous colors is red-orange , orange , and yellow-orange , as shown on Fig. 7-2 . This type of color harmony produces delicacy , softness , and attractiveness . It lacks contrast and boldness ; but brings refined beauty , which under many conditions is very suitable and pleasing . Analogous colors are much used in decorative schemes for the home , and in women 's costumes . Contrasting colors may be made harmonious through a tone balance in several ways : ( 1 ) There may be a color-contrast harmony , through the use of a color and its complement . Such // colors are found at the ends of anv diameter on the color circle , as yellow and violet . The areas covered by the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by contrast . ( 2 ) One or both of the colors may be subdued or grayed in a contrasting color harmony . ( 3 ) The values of the colors in the contrasting pair may be varied enough to secure a pleasing tone balance . The values are changed by making the colors darker or lighter . The Modern Theory of Color . The old theory that red , yellow , and blue are the primary colors is still the basis for mixing colors in many trades and industries , and is generally used in public schools . Modern scientists in experimenting with light ray colors have come to the conclusion that light rays separate into red , green , and violet-blue as the basic or primary // colors . Students of color , such as A. H. Munsell , use a five point color circle , with intermediate half steps . This color circle is made up of red , yellow , green , blue , and purple , with the intermediate colors , yellow-red , green-yellow , blue-green , purpleblue , and red-purple ( Fig. 7-3 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rays will produce red , green , and violet-blue , and for this reason these three colors are called primary colors . Other colors can he produced by mixing light rays from the three colors : dark red , green , and violet-blue . It must be remembered that mixing the rays of colored lights and mixing pigments or dyes are two very different things . The spectral colors all come from white light , and they can be recombined into white light by the use of a second prism , which must he inverted and placed so as to gather the rays of light that have been dispersed into a spectrum by a similar prism , which originally broke up the white light into spectral colors . If pigments of the same spectral colors are mixed together , the result is not white , but gray . This shows plainly that we can not mix pigment colors by the same methods that are used in combining light rays and secure similar results . The contrasting colors which are at the ends of the diameters of the ten point color circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red , yellow , green , blue , and purple ? other colors can be secured by mixing . The color harmony is not quite the same as that obtained from the old theory of six colors with a twelve-point circle . According to this new theory the complementary color of red is blue-green ; the complement of green is red-purple ; and the complement of purple-blue is yellow . Acceptable Color Combinations . The amateur colorist should not allow himself to become confused by the two theories and two methods of mixing colors . Both methods are used and both are offered in this book in order to meet the needs of persons who have learned one method and do not understand the other . While it is probably true that the new theory is more scientific and produces more pleasing complementary colors , the old system is still used widely , and can not be overlooked in a discussion of color mixing . // LIST OF GOOD COLOR COMBINATIONS 1 .

This list of colors which most authorities will say produce pleasing harmonies , is offered in the hope that it may be helpful to persons who are not experienced in selecting good combinations from one or the other of the color circles . Another reason why this list is valuable is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are often employed to produce certain effects that are obtainable in no other way . Some of the color combinations are analogous or closely related colors . A few of the pairs , such as yellow and violet , are complementary colors according to the old color theory , and are shown at opposite ends of a twelve point color circle . The combinations in the list are in general based on the old theory of three primary colors and a twelve point color wheel . It should be noted , however , that slight changes in some of the hues will make the combinations correct according to the ten point color circle . Hue is not the only characteristic of a specific color . It has already been pointed out in the section on Color Harmony that each color has a number of values which are known as tints and shades , and that brilliancy and partial neutrality must also be considered in arranging a pleasing color combination . In general , color combinations are most pleasing when one hue is dominant , and when shades , tints , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the present day should have a list of pleasing color combinations , a very good eye , and taste if he is to be successful in the use of paint enamels or lacquer enamels because colors are often demanded in various color // harmonies for finishing close grained woods that are now fre quently used in making certain types of furniture . Let us sup-pose our colorist has an end table that he wishes to finish with a body color of blue . The " List of Good Color Combinations " will indicate several possible colors that can be used as trim mings . Such a list indicates that greater freedom can be used in some cases than would be apparent from a slavish following of the combinations indicated on either of the color circles . Many other satisfactory color combinations in pairs or triads might be added to the list just given . The list , while not complete , suggests harmonies that are accepted by the color critics in general . Palette of Colors for Staining . The wood finisher can secure practically any color effect that lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the color circle . The colors most used at the present time are browns , greens , reds , oranges , and blacks , in various combinations , sometimes in tints or shades , and again in tones that approach neutral grays . Such primary colors as brilliant yellow and blue are not usually put on wood in their full strength and hue ; nevertheless , they are valuable in mixing with other colors . It is necessary to have the primary // colors , red , yellow , and blue , in full chroma or brilliancy if any of the mixed colors are to be intense and brilliant . Ivoryblack is commonly used to darken or make shades of the various colors . The Practice of Color Mixing . In previous chapters the materials used for wood staining have been discussed . Now comes the problem of using stains in everyday furniture finishing practice . First the mixing or blending of colors must be considered . Wood stains used in production are nearly always made by blending . This is true whether soluble colors or pigment colors are used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual standards , but there are always problems in color correction and adjustment as well as those of developing new colors and new finishes . A competent finisher must therefore know something of the general principles of color blending and color matching . Only practice can develop color matching skill , but the basic theory of color mixing is relatively simple . This is graphically illustrated by the color circle which shows clearly and simply the relationship of colors ( Fig. 7-4 ) . On this circle are the three primary colors ? red , yellow , and blue ? spaced 120 degrees apart . Between these are the secondary colors ? orange , green , and purple . The secondary colors are made by mixing the adjacent primary colors . Thus a mixture of red and yellow produces orange . A mixture of yellow and blue makes green . Colors which are directly opposite each other on this circle are complementary . If they are mixed they will neutralize each other and produce gray . This principle is constantly used in matching and adjusting stain colors . If a mixture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back with green . If there is no green base color , yellow and blue ( blue-black ) may be used . To give additional warmth to a mixture that is too green or cold add more red . Most wood stains are some shade of brown . Mixing the three primary colors ? red , yellow , and blue ? will produce shades of brown . By varying the components one gets browns of every tone ? red browns , green browns , yellow browns , purple browns , and so forth . A good illustration of how this color theory is put into practice is in the use of the non-grain96 Coloring , Finishing , and Painting Wood raising stain base colors , using a red , a yellow , and a blueblack . ( Blue-black is preferable to a clear sharp blue because it works better in producing the great majority of wood stain colors . ) When this blue-black is put in the color circle , the region between red and blue becomes brownish purple and the region between yellow and blue-black becomes olive green . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and blue-black ? is added orange . This orange is roughly equivalent to a mixture of ten parts yellow and one part red . Adding this orange base color to the regular yellow will give it good light-fastness and strength . Since most red and brown tones contain both red and yellow , it is a good idea to start with orange and obtain the desired color by adding red and blueblack A light lemon-yellow base color is also added . It is used for producing a bright yellow undertone , or is tinted with red and blue-black for colors which are strong in yellow . The reason this light yellow is not used altogether ( eliminating the medium yellow ) is that it is weak in strength , and quite strongly acidic . This causes some package troubles . Therefore its use is limited to those colors not obtainable with orange , or those requiring a high content of medium yellow . As a rule it is best to use orange whenever possible to keep the amount of medium yellow in any mixture low , and to use light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colors ( in NCR stains ) for wood finish undertone staining are made with these base colors ? red , the two yellows , blue-black , and orange . Occasionally , for special purposes , it is necessary to use a bright clear blue , a sleep maroon red , a bright green , a rich brown color , and a few others . In the pigment colors a wider group of individual color pigments is used for reasons of cost availability and performance . Thus , for most brown tones start with natural browntoned mineral pigments , such as umber and sienna . Raw umber is greenish brown , whereas burnt umber is reddish brown . Raw sienna is yellowish brown , but burnt sienna is quite red . With these , for further tinting use red and yellow iron oxides and occasionally red chemical pigments such as litho or rosclake . Use chrome yellow for a bright yellow color . By using white // trial mix on a test piece , let dry five or ten minutes , then wet with naphtha . The sap stained area should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the system involves a subsequent application of pigment sealer , the sap stained area should match the adjacent wood when dry ( no naphtha wetting applied ) . In either case , always make a final test by recoating with the subsequent body stain plus sealer . If the sap stained areas do not match , make the necessary adjustment . Trim staining . This is the same basic problem as sap staining , but is used when there is a white or light wood area which must first be stained to the average color of the veneer wood . You can often do this simply by first applying the body or undertone stain to the trim parts only , followed by an overall even application . Sometimes it is necessary to make a special trim stain mixture to tie the two woods together . It just depends upon the result that is desired , and can only be obtained by trial and error . The testing procedure is the same as for sap stain . Equalizing or shading stain . This is another name for pigmented sealer . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle . ( Lacquer enamels can also he used as equalizing stains . ) The name is generally used only for those pigment sealers which are relatively high in pigmentation , and which are used in fairly opaque application , to hide color defects , such as mineral streaks in the wood . An even overall application of equalizing stain will produce a more even color than any solution stain applied in the same way , but at the same time may produce an opaque or " painted " appearance . Equalizing stains are useful when defects are too pronounced to conceal in any other way . Pigmented sealers are used for a great variety of present day light undertone finishes . To obtain good transparency use them sparingly and with quite a low pigment concentration . Uniforming or wiping stains . This is another name for pigment stains . They are made by dispersing pigment colors in penetrating oil or varnish type vehicles . When they are evenly applied over woods of unlike colors , they produce an effect similar to that of the lacquer equalizing stains . In strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The need for uniforming stains has lessened with the modern trend toward lighter wood finishes . The main difference between pigment uniforming stains and lacquer equalizing stains is that the uniforming stains can be wiped and when wiped they lie down in the surface pores of the wood and produce better transparency . They actualiy have some value in developing grain or figure in the small pore woods . ' When pigiuent-uniforming stains and pigment-equalizing lacquers are sprayed on without wiping , there is little difference in their performance . Glazing . A process of highlighting is often accomplished by glazing . Glazes are pigments finely ground in oil which are brushed , wiped , and blended over the filler or sealer to give a highlighted , shaded , or antiqued effect . To give an antiqued effect . wipe the glaze clean from the flat surfaces and edges that are to appear worn , leaving it in the recessed areas . Tinting colors can also be used for glazing if they are reduced to brushing consistency with turpentine or mineral spirits . Color Samples . The furniture finishing materials shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on soft , open-grained woods which bring out the true shade of the stain involved . The shade and depth of any color will vary with the iuethod of application used and the type of wood upon which it is applied . All of the finishing materials shown are transparent or semitransparent coatings ; therefore colors are additive , i.e. , the resultant depth and appearance of the finish will be the color of the wood , plus the color of the stain , plus the color of the filler . By applying several coats of ready-mixed stain , you may produce deeper tones with the same approximate color value . The shade and depth of the finishing material shown naturally appear much darker on a dark wood , such as walnut , than on a light wood , such as pine . Likewise a coat of stain in the selected color , plus a coat of the filler , will tend to produce a darker and stronger tone than either the stain or filler alone . Close-grained woods such as maple , birch , and gum may be finished with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each . The use of both produces a more uniform color it 11 greater depth than if only one were used . // Open-grained woods , such as oak or mahogany , should be finished with stain and a filler . Only the filler is necessary in many cases to produce light shades on these woods . For in-stance , limed oak or natural filler would produce blonde or light finishes without any stain . In general , the color of the filler should he a little darker than the shade of the stain so that a contrast will be apparent between the pore and the flake of the wood . After the stained and filled surfaces have had an applica tion of lacquer sealer , it may be necessary to do some uni forming . Shading lacquers may be used for this . They are sprayed over the light sections of the piece of furniture until a shade is reached which will match the rest of the piece . Ready-mixed stain concentrates may 1 ) e added to stains to modify the color . For example , the addition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition of stain reducer will weaken the strength of the color . To obtain the most satisfactory results there is no substi tute for experimentation . Apply the stain or filler to a small portion of the wood first and make any necessary adjustments before proceeding with the entire staining and finishing opera tion .

' The rapidly increasing popu larity of plywood paneling as a means of beautifying the con-temporary home makes it necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7-11 and 12 ) . The public is gradually learning that plywood is made not only of fir and other softwoods , but also in a large number of hardwoods used for wall paneling , built-ins and so forth . Most paneled rooms are finished in what is frequently called the " light natural " effect . This is a finish which very closely retains the original tone and color of the wood . No stain , filler , or sealer is used even on open pored woods such as oak , walnut , and mahog any . The conventional finish consisting of a coat of shellac and two coats of varnish is to a great extent taboo , not only be-cause it darkens the wood , but also because of the " built-up " effect it produces . // The homemaker , interior decorator , and architect all like the warmth and livability provided by wood paneling in the light natural effect . The beauty of most hardwood plywoods in their nn finished state is the main reason for the continued popularity of the natural finish . This finish is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Part of its popularity is its ease of application and low cost . The shortage of skilled wood finishers makes it almost imperative that finishes for wood paneling be as simple and foolproof as possible . An unskilled workman will find it difficult to follow the complicated procedures of bleaching , staining , filling , and so forth , but he will have no trouble with the light natural effect , consisting of just two or three coats of an easily applied clear finish . Although hardwood plywood is reasonably priced , an expensive finishing job would make the overall cost of the installation too high for most people . The light natural effect is the least expensive finish and , besides is simple enough that many homeowners do the job themselves with excellent results . A special brushing lacquer was developed to meet this demand for a truly natural finish . Water-clear in color , it produces a finish shades lighter than normally obtained with varnish . This lacquer is especially formulated for brushing , as most wood paneling is finished after installation . It dries to the touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As it picks up little or no dust on shying , only a light steel wooling is required after each coat . The wood is well protected without the built-tip effect of varnish . Next in popularity to the natural finish for wood paneling are the blond and pickled effects . These are especially effective in overcoming the slight yellow cast of woods such as American elm , tamo and sell . In the past , these finishes were obtained by wiping the surface with thinned paint or white lead , but , the result usually was a muddy or " painty " effect obscuring the grain of the wood . Now many architects are specifying a white resin sealer for blond and pickled effects , because it penetrates the grain of the wood and wipes clean without a smeary effect . Softwoods such as knotty pine and cedar have a fairly uniform texture and can be finished in the same way as the IiardColors // woods . Other softwoods , such as fir plywood and ponderosa pine , having alternate soft spring and hard summer growths , present certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint and enamel work and so-called " wild grain " in stain finishing . Special resin scalers have been developed as an aid in finishing these woods . A resin sealer , in effect , brings the soft spring growth approximately to the same density as the hard summer growth . It holds the grain of the wood in a tight grip that largely stops its movement , thus minimizing the possibility of grain raise and face checking in painted or enamel work . On stained effects a resin sealer assures more even absorption of stain resulting in a subdued and richer appearance . Resin sealers are made in a clear and white pigmented version . The clear is used on softwoods prior to staining and in natural finishes with shellac and varnish as the finish coats . It sometimes is used prior to painting , especially where darkcolored paints are to he applied . White pigmented resin sealer is generally recommended for painted and enameled work , because it not only acts as a sealer but also provides an excellent undercoat for paint and enamel . Where required , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finish coats . Pigmented resin sealers are also used for blond and pickled effects . As in all finishing jobs , the importance of careful sanding should be stressed . Many inexperienced finishers feel that the average paneled room with 200 square feet or more of surface is too much of a sanding job . They either skip this part of the work , or do it poorly . However , the final result depends at least as much on the preparation of the wood surfaces as it does on the finishing materials , especially when blond , pickled , stained , or complicated finishes are required . Nail holes left from the installation of the paneling have always been a problem . It is well to fill these holes after the first coat of clear finish is applied . To eliminate nailing and hail holes , much paneling is now completed with the use of prepared contact cement . A plastic wood putty of the correct shade or a pure linseed oil putty , tinted with colors-in-oil , a shade or so darker than the overall tone of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to put the putty into the holes // with a putty knife so that it does not get on the surface and make an oil ring . Any oil that does get on the face of the panel must be wiped off immediately . The putty must dry hard , usually 24 hours , after which it is lightly sanded and the subsequent coats of finish applied . Another problem in the finishing of a paneled room is how to treat the trim when it is a different wood from that of the panels . Usually pine or birch is used for trim even when the paneling is a hardwood , such as oak , walnut , or mahogany . Ordinary stains usually are not satisfactory in staining the trim to match paneling of a darker wood , especially when a light natural effect is required . Clcar resin sealer thinned about 2M ' , with turpentine or mineral spirits and tinted with colorsin-oil makes an excellent stain for trim as shade and intensity of color can easily he regulated . Procedure for Finishing Wall Paneling . A number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light natural effect , the following procedure is suggested : 1 . Apply one coat of clear resin sealer. 2 . Allow four hours of crying time . 3 . Fill all nail roles carefully with plastic wood or linseed oil putty of proper shade . 4 . Apply the first coat of special brushing lacquer . 5 . Allow it to cry and rub lightly with fine steel wool . 6 . Apply the second coat of special brushing lacquer . 7 . After this coat dries , ruh it lightly with steel wool . 8 .

Colors and Their Application TOO Chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Origin . Coal tar , once considered an almost worthless waste product , is a very black , opaque , thick mass , which is liquid at certain temperatures . It is formed through condensation from gas in pipes during the nrumfacture of coal gas , and is , therefore , a distillate from coal . The first coal-tar dyes were produced from aniline , which is one of the light tar oil derivatives from nitrobenzene . Many other coal-tar ( Ives are derived , not from aniline , but from medium and heavy tar oils , among these colors being many of the alizarine gronp . In variety of tints and shades , and in brilliancy of hue , the coal-tar dyes are superior to all other dyestuffs . A French chemist is reported as having said that about 14,000 shades and tints of various lees can be made from coal tar . Less than one-tenth of this number is now made and actually used . The fugitive characteristic of many of the early coal-tar dyes has long been overcome . Chemically , some of these artificial dyes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dyes Are Not Aniline Dyes . Aniline is simply one of several derivatives from nitrobenzene , which is manufactured from light tar oil . any other coal-tar dyes are prodneed from other derivatives . Products of Coal-Tar Distillation . During the year 1845 Hofmann , a German chemist , discovered that the hydrocarbon , benzene , is present in coal tar . Research students , especially the Englishman , Perkin , discovered Mauveine or Mauve somewhat accidentally when working with aniline , a derivative of ben-110 // zene ; thev also found out that a heatitiful violet or mauve color of tinctorial power is produced by the oxidation of aniline . Benzene ( C , ; 11 , ; ) is simply one of many coal-tar derivatives , as is aniline which comes from nitrobenzene . The various component parts of coal tar are separated by distillation at various temperatures . The most important groups are indicated as folloNvs : 1 . Temperature up to 110 ? C. produce first runnings . 2 . Temperature from 110 ? np to 210 ? C. distil out light and middle oils . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benzene ( C L ) , toluene ( C7I1A xylene ( C , 11 , , , ) , and their many derivatives are obtained . The boiling point of henzene is 81 ? C. Toluene boils at 110 ? C. , and xylene at about 130 ? to 14FC . Aniline comes from benzene through its derivative , nitrobenzene . This so-called naphtha , or light oil distillate , represents only about 3 per cent of the coal-tar weight , and the yield of benzene is about V per cent of the original tar . 3 . Temperatures between 210 ? and 240 ? C. produce the heavv oils , known as the carbolic oils . In this group are found cresol , and especially phenol , and naphthalene ( C , ( , I1 , ) . 4 . Temperatures from 240 ? tip to 270 ? C. distil heavy or creosote oils . ' Much naphthalene is produced in the lower ternperattrres of this group , but little is present near the . 270 ? C. temperature . Many hydrocarbons are mixed with coal-tar creosote oil , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last named substance coming off at the highest temperatures , especially . Coal-tar creosote is practically free from the light oils , which come off at the lowest temperatures , and " pitch " which remains as a residue at the temperature of 270 ? C. This creosote is similar in its properties to wood-tar creosote , and is used as a preservative . The creosote distillate represents about 10 per cent of the coal-tar vveight , and may yield as much as about S per cent of naphthalene . 5 . Temperatures between 270 ? and 400 ? C. produce anthracene or anthracene oil , also called " green oil . " This distillate , considered to he the most valuable of all the coal-tar conistituents , contains about 10 per cent of anthracene // ( C , .4I1111 ) a liquid oil of high boiling point , and several solid hydrocarbons , such as paraffine , chrysen , carbazol , and phenanthrcue . The oils and solid materials are separated after cooling ; and , after certain purification processes , a 50 per cent anthracene compound is produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Important reds , oranges , blues , violets , and greens of the alizarine group are made from , mthracene , which in its pure state is a white crystalline substance Authracene oil often represents about 11 ? per cent of the weight of the coal tar from which it is made . 6 . Temperatures of 400 ? C. and above leave a residue or pitch which is a liquid but rather thick and viscous substance while hot . After the valuable anthraccne is extracted , creosote or carbolic oils are often mixed with the hot pitch in order to produce a soft pitch or soft tar , sonic kinds of which are liquid at ordinary temneratures . Soft pitch commonly melts and is liquid at about 60 ? C. , while hard pitch melts at about 120 ? C. Pitch , which is a very high temperature distillate , frequently represents about 60 per cent of the coal tar by weight . Methods of Classifying and Naming Synthetic Dyes . Two quite distinct classifications of dyes are now used . One is that made by the chemist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employing letters or numbers for further identification . This classification is a scientific system . The other method is a classification of dyes by their mode of application , or as the dyer or colorist groups them for use . The latter classification is practical and more intelligible to the ordinary user of dyes and stains . The riser can tell something of the color and class of dyestuff by learning a few things about how dyes are named by the chemists and manufacturers . Each dye is apt to have a trade name and a distinguishing letter to indicate the shade or tint ; and also the manufacturer 's or dealer 's name may be shown . The chemist or manufacturing company discovering the color generally names it ; sometimes giving any appropriate name , but often using a word showing the chemical class to which the given line belongs , or suggesting an indication of the physical properties or method of application . // The particular quality of tone of a clue may be used in a name , as croceinc scarlet or malachite green . Some dyes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's violet , or sometimes after places as Erie , London , Congo , and Kashmir . Many dyes have names that indicate the chemical group to which they belong , as azo rubine or methylene blue . The amount of concentration of a dye is sometimes indicated by an X or the abbreviation " conc. " or " extra conc . " All of these marks show specially strong coloring matter . Degrees of dilation in strength are marked by Homan numerals , as Auramine I , II , III , the last nanied being the most diluted . The letters S and SS are iised to designate dyes of exceptional solubility ; while " 11 " , after the name indicates , usually , that the color is for wool . Dyes are sometimes mixed by the nuuuifactnrcrs and given some name that indicates the color , strength , shade , or solubility . The names of such mixed dyes are likely to be still more confusing than those of single unmixed colors . When the dye is given a Shultz number , it cau be properly identified by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Crudes and Intermediates for Dves . The crudes or raw materials from which all coal-tar colors arc made are derived from distillation . The chief crudes used today are : benzene , tolaene , xylene , carbazol , naphthalene. , and antbracene ? all made from coal tar . Pure benzene , toluene , and xylene are quite well known volatile and colorless liquids . Naphthalene , carbazol , and anthracene are colorless solids in crystalline form . From the above named crudes , and two or three other minor ones , are made about 325 substances called intermediates in the dye industry . From the light tar oils benzene , tolaene , and xylene are made ; and from these crudes come intermediates , called nitrobenzene , resorcine , phenol , and benzaldehyde . From the medimn heavy oils are distilled the crude naphthalene ; and from this material are made such important intermediates as the naphthols , and naphthylamines , and the less valuable phthalic ( t I . il'ic ) acid . The other important crude , anthracene , produces the intermediate anthraquinone , and from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // The intermediate which is produced in the largest quantities at present is nitrobenzene , from which aniline is made . About one half of the aniline manufactured in the United States is used in making aniline dyes , while the other half is used in the rubber industry . In making the " intermediates , " the " crudes " are treated with such materials as nitric acid , sulphuric acid , chlorine , caustic soda , lime , and nascent hydrogen . CIIF.MISI ' ' S CLASSIFICATION OF COAL-TAR DIES Chemical structure is the basis of the classification of dyes used by the chemist . Some dyes are made by combining intermediates ; others are manufactured through processes of sulfonation , oxidation , or nitration . Many dyes , like the azo colors , are , however , the result of complex reactions . The following are the most important of the chemical classes of dyes : Azo Compounds . Azo dyes are found in several of the application classifications ; some are neutral or acid , some are basic , while others may be direct ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit soluble . The azo compounds of rather simple structure are usually yellow or red in color , while those of more complex constitution may be in the dark colors , such as black , blue and violet . The acid azo dyes represent a large group of colors , and include many ordinary wool yellows , oranges , starlets , blacks , such as Matanil Yellow , Tartrazine , Azo Acid Blue , Naphthol Black , Azo Orange ( II , IV , G. etc . ) , Ponceau , Azofuchsine , and others . The basic azo group is quite small , but contains the Safranine azo colors ( Janus Blue , etc . ) , Bismarck Brown , Chrysoidine , Tannin Orange , and New Phosphine . Triphenylmethane Dyes . This is a rather large class , and includes many of the brilliant colors with their various nuances . To this class belong many colors that are well known and much used . This group includes basic , acid , and mordant dyes , but none of the other application classes . Acid members of this class include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Acid Magenta which is the same as // Acid Fuchsine , acid greens , patent blues , ketone blues , Neptune Green , Erioglaucine , and others . Azine Dyes . This group contains 46 colors ranging from red , through the violets , over to and including some blues . Roth acid colors and basic colors are found among the azines . The basic members include spirit Indulines , Safranines , and Rhodulines . Perkin 's Mauve or Mauveine , the first aniline color , belongs to this group . The acid members among the azines include Nigrosines , Soluble Indulines , Rosindulines , Wool Fast Blue , and Wool Fast Violet ; also a spirit soluble Nigrosine , and an acid water soluble Nigrosine with various brands of each on the market . The spirit soluble Nigrosine is used in black spirit varnishes and polishes , and also for a dye for coloring silk . It is a bluish black , and is used ranch like the spirit soluble Indnline , except that the latter produces a more bluish violet tone . There is also an acid water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indulines are often mixed with other colors of similar application classes . The acid water soluble Nigrosines are often used in connection with other acid dyes to secure darker colors . They are sometimes found in stains for wood and dyes for silk . They are , however , only , moderately fast to light . Various brands of this color are sold , but they arc all similar to Slmltz 's Nigrosine No. 700 . Spirit soluble Nigrosines , which are soluble in alcohol but not in water , are used in spirit stains for wood , and for darkening otter colors . These Nigrosines are also used for staining leather , for printing calico and dyeing silk , and produce bluish black shades . They are often mixed with Chrysoidiune R ( spirit soluble ) , which is of a yellowish red color . The various brands of spirit soluble Nigrosines which arc sold are similar to Shultz 's No. 698 . Xanthene Colors . These colors form a group containing some of the most brilliant acid and basic dyes made , and are , in general , faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anthracene or Anthraquinone Dyes . This large group contains 67 acid and mordant dyes , and includes the alizarines and 82 sat elves . ' I'hesc colors are , in general , remarkable for great // fastness to light The anthraquinone class does not include any basic colors . The " acid " colors of the group are numerous and important , and include : Alizarine Direct Blue , Violet , and Green ; Alizarine Sapphire , a reddish blue dve which is very fast to light ; the German dyes , Alizarine Irisol D and R , bri , 7ht bluish violet wool and silk dyes , which are very fast to light ; Alizarine Fnucraldol G ( paste ) , a bluish green ( lye for wool and silk , moderately fast to light ; Alizarine Astrol B and G , greenish blue , and very fast to light on wool and cotton ; anal the Alizarin ( , Bubinols , some of which are of a bluish red color and fast to light , while others are pink and salmon in hue and are used on dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uitroso colors are few in number and contain only " acid " and " mordant " dyes . The important acid water soluble dye in the Nitroso group is often called Naphthol Green B. It comes in powder or paste form , is very fast to light , and is used as a wool dye , the coloring matter being used in an acid bath containing an iron salt . Naphthol Green is also used in the manufacture of pigments . This color is a very useful yellowish green dye , recommended as a stain for wood finishing , nishing because of its light proof qualities . The Nitro class is also small , containing several yellow acid dyes and a few mordant and pigment colors . The most important " acid " member of this class is generally named Naphthol Yellow S , but is sometimes called Sulphur Yellow S , Acid Yellow , or ' Martins Yellow . It is used as a yellow color for silks and wool , and also is permitted as coloring matter in food in Australia and the United States . Victoria Yellow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colors . This group contains about 44 dyes , and includes both basic and mordant colors but no acid dyestuffs . The colors are largely blue , Nleldola 's Blue or New Blue R being the most important . Acridine Colors . The Acridine colors are about 15 in number , and consist of yellow and orange dyestuffs , all of which are basic dyes . They are only moderately fast to light , ranking , usually about 3 or 4 in the scale of 5 for fastness . Their chief uses are in dyeing leather and cotton , and in printing calico . Thiazine Colors . This group consists of about 13 dyestuffs , // mainly blue in color . It has representatives among the basic , acid , mordant , and sulphur dyes . Basic colors . The most important dye among the Thiazines is the basic dye , ? Methylene Blue , which is high in fastness to light , ranking 2 in the scale of 5 ? , of which 1 is the most permanent of all . Methylene Blue is soluhle in both water and alcohol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for wood staining on account of its fastness to light It is also commonly used for dyeing cotton in half silk , jute , straw , and artificial flowers . On account of its excellent fastness to light , to washing and rubbing , to ironing , to water , and to acids , it is one of the most largely used of all the basic fives . Other important Thiazine basic colors are : Methylenc Green , which ranks as the fastest of all of the basic green coloring matters , and Thioninc Blue , also quite fast and soluble in both water and alcohol , although less easily soluble in the latter . Acid color . Thiocarmine is the acid member of the Thiazine class , and is a good blue for wool and silk . It is not so fast to light as Patent Buie or Cyanol . Thiazole Colors . This class includes a small group of six distinct colors , some of them having muncrons names . There is one basic dve ? Blhodnline Yellow T , or Thioflavine T ? which is a moderately fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Quinoline Colors . The quinolines form a small group of 12 colors , only three of them being m n ufactured in the United States . These dyes are largely used in the manufacture of the color sensitive plates . The most important member of the group from a dyer 's standpoint is Quinoline Yellow , which is a basic ( lye and insoluble in water , though sparingly soluble in alcohol . it is a yellow used to color paraffine , wax , and spirit varnishes . From Quinoline Yellow , treated with fuming sulphuric acid , an acid dye soluble in water called Quinoline Yellow O is made . Most of the other Quinoline colors are quite fugitive , and are unsuitable for use as stains for wood . Indigoid Colors . This group contains 54 colors , including a mimbcr of valuable " vat " dyes . There are no basic or mordant colors listed in this class , and orily one acid dye ? Indigo Carmine ? which is not much used , because it is not fast to light mid has bccii replaced by Patent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ user of dyes does not understand the chemical structure of dves which are made from the rather simple hydrocarhons , such as benzene ( C , ; II ? ) , toluene ( C , H , , ) , xylene ( C , II1 ( , ) , naphthalene ( C , JI , ) , and anthracene ( C ? H11 , ) . If , however , dyes are classed together on a basis of methods of application to various fibers , and of affinity for and reaction on the fibers themselves , it is easier to grasp the significance of such a grouping . It is of interest to the wood finisher to examine a list of the application classes which are known to the textile dyer . It should be remembered , however , that some colors can be placed in two or more classes , and applied by more than one method . This may be one to the peculiar chemical composition of the dyes which can be classified in more than one group , or to certain chemical or physical properties of the fibers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as follows : 1 . Acid ( Ives . 2 . Basic dyes . 3 . Salt , direct , or substantive dyes . 4 . ' Mordant dyes . 5 . Pigment dyes . 6 . Developing colors. 7 . Sulphur colors. 8 . Vat dyes . Acid Dyes . In general , acid dyes are very largely derived from azo compounds of toluene and benzene , both of which come from light tar oils . These dyes are said to be salts of color acids which are easily soluble in water . Most of the acid dyes require the presence in the bath of some acid which liberates the color-acid , and thus allows it to combine with bases which are found in the fibers being dyed , usually animal fibers , such as silk and wool . On these materials , acid dyes act as direct dyes , and need no mordant . Many acid dyes do not dye vegetable fibers , therefore they are not much used for dyeing cotton goods . It should be pointed out very clearly , however , that altli nrgh pure cellulose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as is found in jute and wood , will combine directly with acid dyes . The azo acid group is a large one , and contains many yellows , oranges , scarlets , blacks , etc . There is also a small // class of vellow dyes , the most important member of which is Naphtfiol Yellow S , which is derived from nitro compounds . Individual acid ( Ives vary considerably in fastness to light . In general , the azo fives are quite permanent , while acid violets and greens , nsnnally , are more fugitive . Sonic acid fives are not entirely satisfactory on textiles , because they will not stand washing , especially if soap is used . On wood , however , these same dyes give no trouble , becanse the colors are fast to light , and are usually protected by varnish coats . The acid colors do not usually show ao acid reaction in themselves , but are sold in powders of alkaline salts of potassium or annnouium which are soluble in water . The neutral or alkaline powders of acid dyes are acidified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dyeing wool or silk . The acid reacts on the dyestuff in such a way as to set free the color acid , and also to change the composition of the fibers to be dyed . This leaves them in the proper condition to receive the dve . Sometimes acetic or formic acid , or even aminominn acetate , is used as a substitute for sulphuric acid ; in which case the dye is only slightly acid in reaction . There is also a third class of acid ( Ives which will dye some fibers in a neutral bath . When acid dyes arc used as wood stains , it is not usually necessary to add any acid whatever to the stain , becanse wood fibers generally react properly with such dyes and take the color easily . However , many acid coaltar stains when used on wood " bite " more easily if one half pint of table vinegar be added to each gallon of stain . Acid dye powders are soluble in water . They usually dissolve better in hot water , and are frequently prepared in this manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as Metarnil Yellow , Orange 11 , Violamine RR , are somewhat soluble in alcohol . Acid dyes are usually quite cheap , compared with other coloring materials , and the tones produced on most substances are pine and brilliant . In the latter respect , acid dyes are generally superior to both mordant and substantive dyes , but are not equal to basic dyes . Wood stains for use on furniture are at present very largely made from acid coal-tar dyes ( Tahle 1 ) . // Basic Dyes . The characteristics and physical properties of basic dyes soon become known to the dyer , but the name // itself may not mean much to him . To the chemist , however , the word basic is suggestive , because it indicates something of chemical structure and informs him as to the dye 's reactions , with such reagents as acids and alkalies particularly ( Table II ) . Basic colors are substances that have strong affinities for vari ous acids and with them form salts that are more or less stable . Liberation from the salts can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Finishing , and Painting Wood volatile alkali , ammonia , or by reactions with fixed alkalines , such as soda and potash , which have strong basic action . In chemistry , the word base refers to substances that are capable of uniting with acids , thus , some valuable basic dyes come from various other chemical classes , such as the azos , xanthenes , azines , acridines , thiazines , and thiazoles . Less valuable basic dyes , from the dyer 's point of view , are made from the oxazine and quinoline groups . A large number of the early aniline and other coal-tar dyes belonged to the basic group of dyestuffs . In many cases , these basic dyes are very remarkable for brilliancy of color , compared with vegetable colors ; but , quite often , they are more or less fugitive to light . Basic dyes sold on the market are usually in forms which are chemically known as chlorides , being salts of dye bases with hydrochloric acid , but other salts such as sulphates , oxalates , acetates , and nitrates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free base are known , however , in a few cases . Dlethvl Violet , Magenta , and sonic other colors made by the " melt " process are in a crystalline form ; while most of the basic dyes manufactured by other methods are in the form of powders . In a dye bath , basic salts seem to separate into an acid and a ( lye base . When dyeing animal fibers , such as wool or silk which seem to possess acid properties in themselves , the dye base combines with the fibers , and acid is left in the bath . When cotton is dyed with these &; es the dye base combines with the acid mordant . Cotton requires a previous preparation in a tannic acid bath , called a mordant . Mordanting of vegetable fibers , such as cotton and linen , is accomplished by steeping the material to be dyed in a cold tannin bath for several hours , and fixing in a tartar emetic ; or following this treatment by passing the goods being dyed through a solution of some metallic salt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or some other metal are finally formed . Wool and silk because of their acid reaction are dyed with basic ( Ives in a neutral bath without previous treatment . // Brighter colors in wool and silk fabrics are sometimes secured from basic dyes by adding about two per cent of soap to the dye bath . Basic dyes are not as valuable to the dyer of textile fibers as formerly , because we now have other dyes of greater fastness that can be applied by easier methods . Cotton and linen fabrics which have been dyed with " salt " or " sulphur " colors are often improved by " topping " or redyeing with basic colors . This application of basic dyes increases the fastness to light of " salt " colors , and produces more brilliant tones over " sulphnr " colors . No mordant is needed for " topping " fibers with basic dyes , because the preyioiis dyeing serves as a mordanting where " salt " mordant or " sulphur " colors have been used . For wool and silk , basic dyes have vcry largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant acid dyes which are more numerous and produce more even tones . For hark-tanned leather which contains much tannic acid , basic colors are recommended , because the leather absorbs these dyes easily , and evenness of tone and fastness to light are not so important . bloodstains which are produced by dissolving basic dyes in water or alcohol are used by the wood finisher to a limited extent . The colors obtained by the application of basic dyes to wood are clear and brilliant ; but , in many cases , beautiful tone effects are changed and faded by exposure to light . It has already been pointed out that a mordant is used with basic dyes when they are used on vegetable fibers . The wood finisher does not wish to spend his time using mordants on stains , therefore he prefers the more convenient and more permanent acid dyes . Spirit stains are made from the most permanent of the basic dyes , and are used with reasonable satisfaction on articles that are not exposed to bright sunlight . Mordants are not commonly used with spirit stains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to apply . Salt , Direct , or Substantive Dyes . The name " direct " colors is given to this particular class of dyestuffs because they really are direct dyes for cotton when used in a neutral or alkaline h ; itIi , and are applied without the use of mordants. // The " direct " colors are sometimes called substantive colors , and also occasionally are referred to by other names , such as Congo colors , ( Hamill ( ' colors , and benzo colors . Most of the direct colors arc alkaline salts of snlfonated tetrazo colors . Salt or direct dyes may be used in a hot neutral or alkaline bath for dyeing silk or wool , and also in an " acid " solution . Direct clues arc , however , rarely used for dyeing animal fibers . Direct colors are absorbed without being broken up , or having only the color acid taken out , as is the case with acid dyes . The salt or direct colors are ordinarily used in a bath of boiling water to which common table salt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such fibers as cotton and linen . Some fibers , especially cotton , linen , and other vegetable fibers , will take direct dyes in a cold or lukewarm bath , but such dyeing will not stand hot soap and water . More permanent colors can be produced with direct dyes by the use of a suitable after-treatment , such as warming in a weak solution of potassium bichiromate which is acidified slightly with acetic acid or strong vinegar . This treatment may considerably change the color and is sometimes objectionable . The salt or direct colors come from two of the chemical groups , namely : ( 1 ) the thiazols and ( 2 ) the azo colors . The direct colors are soluble in water , and in general may be used much like acid dyes ; they are useful , especially , on cotton and linen , while acid dyes in general will not color cotton or many vegetable fibers . Some of the direct colors are recommended for cotton , straw , wood chips , paper , linen , jute , and vegetable fibers in general . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acid dues , and should generally contain one ounce of bichromate of potash to the gallon of stain . In fastness to light the direct dyes are very satisfactory , especially , when given an after-treatment of bichromate of potash . Direct dyes can often be mixed with acid dyes in making wood stains . Experts , however , recommend keeping the application classes separate for fear of a chemical reaction . It should also be noted that direct dyes are improved usually by having potassium bichromate in the dye solution or for use as an aftertreatment , while acid dyes are conmronly used with a small // amount of acid , such as acetic acid , irr the stain mixture . It has already been pointed out that such a mixture of an alkali and acid may change the color of a direct dye . Mordant Dyes . Many of the old time vegetable dyes such as logwood , fustic , cutch , Pea sian berries , and the animal dye cochineal , are mordant dyes . It is also true that many of the best of the synthetic or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in connection with the dye , but usually preceding it in application , is necessary with mordant dyes . The use of different mordants with a given color may produce varying shades of color , or even change the hue itself . Salts of chromium , such as chromates or bichromates , are now most commonly used ; while formerly , tin , iron , and aluminum salts were generally used . Mordant dyes are used on both cotton and woolen fabrics . A few mordant dyes produce color in a single bath containing a bichromate or chromate solution ; but , usually , two or more operations are necessary , therefore exact reproduction of colors is difficult , and the many operations are expensive . Several of the chemical groups of dyes contain mordant dyes , as indicated by the following list : nitroso , nitro , aio , triphenylmethane , xanthene , anthracene , oxazine , tiiaiine , and flavone ? all including one or more mordant dyes . On account of their difficulty in application , mordant dyes are not very commonly used as wood stains at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many ages were generally thought to be the only satisfactory dyes , are gradually going out of use ; and , judging by the demand for them on the market , they are not of much importance to the wood finisher today . Pigment Dyes . Certain colors which are insoluble in water and in most solvents can be transferred to fibers by a method of chemical synthesis . Such colors are very fast to light and washing , and are not easily removed from the fibers . Aniline black can be made to dye cotton fiber by means of the oxidation of salts of aniline when bichromates or chromates are used in connection with certain so-called oxygen carriers , such as some of the salts of iron , vanadium , or copper . Other semioxidation colors are the Ursols , the Furols , and Paramine Bonsai . // Pigment dyes are derived from four of the chemical groups as follows : the azo , the nitro , the azine ( which contains Aniline Black ) , and the oxazine classes . In dyeing , the pigment colors are transferred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colorless chemical compounds . Developing Dyes . The developing colors resemble the pigment colors in that they are both insoluble and must he transFerred and formed on the films of the material being dyed . The developing colors are not colorless dyestuffs , but react differently from ordinary dyes because a chemical reaction causes a coloring-matter to be developed and formed on the fibers . Sulphur Dyes . These colors are also insoluble in pure water ; but , if they are dissolved in an aqueous solution of sodium sulphide and heated , they will dye vegetable fibers , especially cotton , in a direct bath . These colors are little used on animal fibers . The resultant hues produced on fabrics are not bright , but appear as dull shades of green , brown , blue , and black . These dyes contain sulphur in the molecules , but their structure is rather indefinite . Sulphur dyes are considerably used , however , for dyeing cotton cloth , and also for yarns and hosiery . An after-treatment with a salt of copper , zinc , or chromium is sometimes used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The term vat dyes is used to designate certain dyestuffs that are themselves insoluble in water but which can be used in the form of their leuco compounds and then oxidized in the air , thus bringing out the colors . A leuco compound in chemistry is one that is colorless and is derived from a dye by reduction , having an unsatisfied affinity for nitrogen . By oxidation or the taking on of oxygen , leuco compounds regain color . For many years indigo was the chief vat dye , but at the present time other indigoid vat dyes are used , such as the Ciba series , the Bromindigos , the Thioindigo series , and Brilliant Indigos . There are also anthracene and thiazine vat dues . Oil-Soluble Wood Stains . Oil-soluble dyes do not form a distinct class of colors either chemically or by application . Colors from any of the various coal tar groups that happen // to be soluble in anv one of the volatile oils are selected , especi-ally the kinds that are most permanent on exposure to sun-light . Some of the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Oil Brown NI . Loutre , and Seal Brown . Brown Mahogany ? Orange G or Y , and Naphthalene Black , or Oil Brown M. Black ? Oil Black , oil-soluble Nigrosine , and Naphthalene . Oil-soluble colors are usually dissolved in turpentine , but benzene or benzol , naphtha , gasoline , and carbon tetrachloride , can also be used as solvents for nearly all such colors . Classes of Dyes Used in Wood Finishing . Most of the books and magazine articles which have been written about dyes have been produced for the textile colorist or dyer , rather than for the person who wishes to use dyes for the purpose of staining wood . The dyes themselves were usually manufactured for dyeing cloth rather than for staining wood ; consequently the characteristics of the various dyes are usually given with reference to their reaction on various kinds of cloth fibers . Acid coal-tar dyes are used by the textile dyer to color fibers of silk and wool . Many of these acid dyes will not color cotton fibers , but they will easily stain the lignocclhtlose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Practically any of the acid coal-tar dyes which are ordinarily used for dyeing silk and wool can be considered as satisfactory stains for wood . Dyes for cloth must prove satisfactory in various tests such as fastness to light , fastness to washing , fastness to milling , and also to " stoving , " to crocking , or rubbing . In selecting an acid coal-tar dye for use as a wood stain the chief considerations are fastness to light and the price of the dyestuff . The best of the acid coal-tar dyes are the most lightproof colors that can be obtained and are now used extensively as wood stains . Acid dyes can usually be mixed together to form new colors , even though the individual dyes may come from different chemical groups . Acid dyes should not be mixed with basic colors , even though the latter may be soluble in water , nor should either of these groups of stains be combined with spiritsoluble or oil-soluble dyes . Acid dyes are not usually acid in reaction but are alkaline salts of sodium , potassium , or ammonium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salts such as sulphates , oxalates , acetates , or nitrates are found . If an acid dye in a solution of water is mixed with a basic dye iii an aqueous solution , a chemical reaction may take place , and a new subCoal-Tar // stance which is soluble in water may be formed . In some cases a compound neutral dye may be produced . Direct or salt dyes can be used in much the same manner as acid dyes for staining wood . In fact , direct colors can often be mixed with acid colors in preparing woodstains . The mix-ing of colors from the different application classes involves a greater risk , however , and is not recommended . Basic dyes when used lv the textile dyer are dissolved in water , are often used on cotton , and are " fixed " with a mordant . Basic dyes are generally soluble in alcohol , and are the colors used by a wood finisher when lie wishes spirit-soluble colors . In general , basic colors are more fugitive than acid coal-tar dye colors , hence they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dyestuffs taken from the other application classes , while useful and practicable as textile dyes , are rarely used on wood because of the difficulty in application to such material . In other words , mordant dyes , pigment dyes , developing colors , sulphur colors , and vat dyes are not in common use by wood finishers , though they are valuable textile dyes . Dyeing or Coloring Wood . Dyeing a piece of wood , in the true sense , consists in steeping it in a solution of dye , and giving it treatments similar to those used in dyeing textiles , straw , and the Iike , in which the color penetrates entirely through the wood mass and changes the hue of all the fibers . Rather large pieces of wood are sometimes stained or dyed to a uniform color throughout the interior instead of on the surface only . This can be done by removing the air in the cells , by placing the piece in a vacuum chamber , and then immersing it in a dye liquid under pressure of 80 to 120 atmospheres in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but is not a common method of coloring or staining wood . Staining or coloring wood is usually done by brush ( or sometimes sponge ) applications , by spraying with an air gun , or by dipping and wiping . This method of staining the surface , or dyeing , as it is sometimes called , changes the color only superficially , because the dye does not penetrate very deeply into the wood mass . Plaits , strips , chips , small blocks , and sometimes match-sticks , are dyed by the first method of uniform penetration , // but furniture and woodwork in general are treated by brushing , spraying , or dipping . The dyes used for such staining are acid dyes , basic dyes , or substantive dyes that are quite fast to light and which are soluble in water . Basic dyes are soluble in either water or alcohol . Some dyes that are useless for dyeing textiles , because they are insoluble in water , are soluble in alcohol , and can be used as spirit stains for wood . Spirit-soluble dyes are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insoluble in water but which are oil soluble , and can be dissolved in benzene or benzol , gasoline , kerosene , or carbon tetrachloride . For the coloring of raffia , straw , wood chips , splints , and other similar materials frequently used in the manufacture of hats and baskets , basic coal-tar dyes of the most permanent kinds are much desired because of their brightness . There is usually enough tannic acid in most of the above materials , and also in jute and many kinds of wood , so that basic dyes can be used directly ; that is , without the application of any other mordant than that already possessed by the fibers themselves . Solubility of Dyestuffs and Wood-Staining Materials . Coloring matter intended for use in textile dyeing and wood staining is found on the market in one of three forms : ( 1 ) as a powder , ( 2 ) as a paste , and ( 3 ) as an extract . The powder form , very commonly used for textile dyes and wood stains , is the most difficult to dissolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors in the groups , vary greatly in their solubility . Water-Soluble Colors . Dyestuffs of the usual solubility , when being prepared as wood stains , are generally dissolved in the proportion of about 3 to 3% ounces of powder to the gallon of soft water . Some of the dye powders of low solubility are used in wood stains in the proportion of one ounce , or even less , to a gallon of water . Dyes for wood are , however , very strong in color , and often as much as six ounces of color in powder form are mixed with one gallon of water in order to secure the proper strength . Dealers in dyes for wood stains usually give instructions as to the amount of powder that should be used in the solvents , which are also named , as water , alcohol , benzol , turpentine , and others . It should be remembered , however , that straining a dye mixture through a cloth of fine mesh is generally advanCoal-Tar // tageous , because this process removes specks and any undissolved powder that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The acid coal-tar dyes which are very often used in staining high-grade furniture are usually very soluble , which is also generally true of alcohol soluble powders . The oil-soluble colors are often harder to dissolve . Hard water when used in dyeing textiles is generally acidulated slightly with acetic acid , using only enough acid in the bath to give an acid reaction with litmus paper . It is , however , preferable in some cases to add a small amount of sulphuric acid to the water instead of acetic acid . This hint on the use of acid with acid dyes in dyeing textiles may prove advantageous to wood finishers in preparing acid water-soluble dyes for staining wood . Water containing iron compounds should not be used in dye baths or stains without first making tests , because chemical reactions of this metal or its salts are liable to change the dye mixture itself in such a way that modified or duller colors may result . Salts of iron with alkali mordants were used as dyes by many ancient peoples , and are still of service in improved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are most satisfactorily dissolved by using boiling soft water . The mixing should be done in vessels of glass , earthenware , or copper , but never in containers of tin , if acid is to be added to the solution , or if the dye itself has an acid reaction , because the iron which forms the body of all tin plated sheet metal may change the dye itself . Spirit Stains . Basic dyes are usually soluble in either water or alcohol . If water is used many basic dyes , such as Malachite Green and Methyl Violet , should be mixed with a small quantity of cold water slightly acidulated with acetic acid , and after stirring well , the thin paste formed can be added to boiling soft water . Some basic dyes should not be mixed or used at higher temperatures than about 180 F. When using the dye Am-amine the temperature should not exceed 170 ? F. , or the coloring matter may be decomposed or precipitated . A small amount of denatured alcohol is sometimes used in a basic dye solution to help in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissolved in water , and // for this reason the dye should be filtered through a flannel cloth , and anv alkalinity of hard water should be neutralized with acetic acid to prevent the color base from precipitating . Spirit wood stains often consist of basic dye powders dissolved in strong denatiured alcohol . Such a stain is very volatile , and dries so rapidly that it is difficult to apply with a brush . Oil-Soluble Dyes . Other solvents besides water and alcohol are sometimes used in making dyes and stains . Ether , benzene , various acids , alum , tannin reagents , ferric chloride , sodium carbonate , and other chemicals will dissolve certain dvestufls . Stains which are commonly called penetrating stains , or vola tile oil stains , are made 1w dissolving in some oil solvent ally of the coal-tar dyes that happen to he soluble in anv of the nondrying oils of a very volatile nature . The solvent oils which are used most commonly are turpentine , benzol , xvlol , solvent naphtha , gasoline , kerosene , and carbon tetrachloride . The dyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from any particular chemical group . All such dyes are , how-ever , free from the sulphonic acid groups . The snlphonic acid groups contain the radical SO.OII . The amount of dry powder used in oil-soluble coal-tar stains varies greatly with the depth or strength of color desired . For light or weak colors , about four ounces of powder to each gallon of solvent may be used , while very dark or strong stains may contain as many as 32 ounces of dry powder to the gallon of stain . // // Chapter IX Wood Fillers The Purpose of Fillers . Wood fillers are used to level the surface of wood by filling the open pores or cavities in the cells . Fillers plug up the cell lumina , or openings , and prevent moisture from entering or leaving the wood ; and , if composed of hard material , they help to form firm , compact , and more rigid surfaces that are less easily dented , scratched , or crushed in by pressure in small spots . Stained fillers are sometimes used to show contrasts , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pores may be wanted , as in silver gray , in which finish the filler may be largely zinc white or a mixture of that substance with a silex paste . By plugging or filling the open cell cavities with non-absorbent material , a level surface is secured which will receive varnish coats and hold them on the surface , instead of allowing such finishes to sink unevenly into the wood ( Fig. 9-1 ) . The type of filler to be used in a given case depends largely upon the porosity and character of the surface of the wood . In general , non-porous , diffuse-poi ors , and ring-porous woods require different treatment in filling . A coarse filler is ordinarily needed only on woods that have large tracheal vessels which Ionianrly served as the water courses for the upward moving sap of the growing tree . The other kinds of wood cells , except possibly the larger fiber tracheids which are found in some of the conifers , have small cell openings which can he sealed up with a liquid filler , because they do not require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CLASSES OR TYPES OF FILLERS There are three types of wood fillers : 1 . An absolutely transparent filler , which is used as a sizing on woods that have such small cell openings that they are invisible to the eye . Such woods do not need to have the pores plugged or filled full of coarse material , and may be sized by oiling or shellacking. 2 . A liquid filler , which is made of drying oils , varnish , turpentine , japan , and a coarse material such as silica or some substitute , such as cornstarch , China clay , whiting , carbonate of magnesia , or talc . Such a filler is intended for use on nonporous or diffuse-porous woods with small cell openings . 3 . Paste filler , which is made from a silex or some other ground rock base , that furnishes coarse nonshrinkable transparent material for plugging cell openings and leveling the long narrow hollow places or depressions that are left by cutting through the tracheal vessels of ring-porous or coarse difIiisc-porous woods . In addition to the silex , paste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it easier in application with a brush to the surface of wood . Transparent Fillers . The time-Honored process of filling wood was by applying many coats of some drying-oil , usually linseed oil , rubbing , and allowing each coat to dry before another was applied . This method of filling the pores and pro-tecting the wood was quite effective on all except possibly the coarse open pored woods ; but it was very slow , because such oils oxidize very slowly , and do not harden for a long time . Linseed oil practically always darkens wood , and is ob-jectionable on some light-colored woods ; but it enriches and brings out the grain and beauty of others , as is the case with walnut ( Fig. 9-2 ) . Shellac as a transparent wood filler came into use later chronologically than linseed oil . It is commonly usecl for this purpose on woods that have pores too small to be seen with the naked eye . Some of the close-grained hardwoods , and most of the coniferous woods , come ender this classification , and can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin coats are better than one heavy application ( Fig. 9-3 ) . Shellac is a spirit varnish which is very transparent and dries hard in about 8 hours , instead of taking many clays , as 136 // does linseed oil . It keeps the wood in almost the natural color , darkening it but little , and does not obscure the grain . With the increasing popularity of lacquer as a finish , the use of shellac as a transparent filler has been somewhat replaced by lacquer sanding sealer . Sanding sealers serve the dual purpose of filling the small pores of close-grained woods and of holding down stains and paste fillers . The more popular sanding scalers contain about 21% solids . Because of their extremely fast-crying nature , they are best applied with a spray gun . They dry in 1-2 hours or less , leaving a somewhat rough surface . After a light , careful sanding , and removal of the fine , white dust , a first coat of lacquer can be applied . Liquid Fillers . Certain surfacers on the market , called architectural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in finishing furniture , are suitable to apply as a sizing material for a first coat on manv of the rather soft , close grained woods that have inconspicuous cell openings . Less labor is required in the application of this type of filler , because it is painted on much like a coat of varnish , and is not rubbed off . Liquid filler obscures the grain to some extent because the silex or coarse material , although nearly transparent when mixed with linseed oil , is stuck to the surface by varnish , instead of being left only to fill the large open pores , as is the case with paste fillers . Liquid fillers are quite commonly used on the less expensive soft woods , when a cheap finish is wanted . They are satisfactory as a first coat on many kinds of wood , especially in finishing the woodwork of houses ; but they are not suitable to use on oak , ash , or other woods with large , conspicuous , open pores . An experienced wood finisher will usually make one gallon of liquid wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingredients found in liquid fillers vary greatly , especially in the amount of silica ( or silex ) and varnish contained . Some liquid fillers are nearly pure varnish with the addition of small amounts of body materials , such as silica or whiting ( calcium carbonate ) , together with some drier and thinner . Other liquid fillers are much like a thin paste filler , with only a small amount of varnish added to the mixture . A filler having much varnish in its composition may be made rip as follows ( next page ) : // 1 quart varnish of good grade , as a rubbing varnish . 1 pint light brown japan . yr to 1/2 pint turpentine . 1 ? pounds , light or floated silica ( much less silica may be used ) . Colors ground in oil may be added in small quantities . The silica should be added last and mixed in gradually while stirring . Varnishes do not quickly assimilate a thinner , or mix with other substances ; consequently , the above liquid filler should stand for one or two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will work freely with a stiff varnish brush . It will spread on the wood more smoothly if strained through cheesecloth and allowed to stand another day or two before being used . The base or coarse materials are apt to settle , therefore the mixture should be stirred often while being applied . A liquid filler with less varnish in proportion to the other ingredients may be mixed as follows : 1 quart body varnish , such as a rubbing varnish . 1 quart brown japan . 2 pounds tine silcx . Thin slightly with turpentine , if necessary , to make it spread better with a stiff brush . A liquid filler of the thinned paste type may be made up as follows : 2 lbs . prepared paste filler . 1/z pint turpentine . r/a pint rubbing varnish . The mixture should be put together in the order named , and may be thinned further with turpentine or benzine if it is to be used on close-grained , nonabsorptive woods . A small amount of any of the colors ground in oil may be added to tint the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which contains no varnish can be used for a cheap finish on coarse-grained woods , such as oak and ash . Liquid fillers are applied to wood evenly lengthwise of the grain , as in varnishing ; and without being rubbed off , if they contain much varnish , they should be allowed to dry . They should then be smoothed with No. 00 or No. 000 sandpaper before the next coat of finish is applied . The prepared liquid fillers sold on the market are usually made from valuable formulas , and by experienced men who // have good equipment ; therefore , they are , in general , more satisfactory than mixtures prepared by the ordinary wood finisher . Nearly all small shops buy ready-mixed fillers , which are usually put up in cans of various sizes . PASTE FILLERS Body Materials in Fillers . Furniture finishers usually prefer paste fillers . Liquid fillers act as sizing , and stop the suction of the cavities of the wood cells , or greatly reduce it , at least ; but , when used on ring porous woods , like oak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin to fill completely the large open tracheal vessels located in the spring wood of each annual layer of growth . Some method of filling these open pores and leveling the surface must be used if a good finish is to be secured . Many coats of liquid surfacer can be applied with quite satisfactory results , provided all the high spots are cut down with fine sandpaper between applications of the finish . The open pores or cell cavities gradually fill up , even with an absolutely transparent or liquid filler . Such a procedure , which was the old-time method of finishing , is slow and expensive . About 50 years ago paste fillers , some of them having a vegetable body , were in common use for finishing all porous woods . It had been discovered that it was better to fill the open cell cavities on the surface of woods having large tracheal vessels with a solid mass rather than with several coats of liquid surfacers . Various materials were tried ? among them cornstarch and wheat flour from the vegetable world , as well as other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbonate ) , China Clay , or Kaolin , which is a hydrated aluminum silicate , Silver White , which is a name given to several white silicate earths , plaster of Paris ( sulphate of lime ) , and probably other similar substances were also used occasionally . All of these materials proved to be more or less misatisfactory , because they were subject to decay or disintegration , or were not transparent enough , or expanded or contracted in the pores , or ( lid not harden properly with the binders , or were too absorbent of shellac or varnish , or failed to meet expectations for some mechanical or chemical reason . Silex , a comparatively new material to be used for the body of wood fillers , appeared in the Wheeler filler about // 1876 ; on account of its many superior qualities , it has nearly supplanted all other substances , especially in high-grade paste fillers . Silex is one of the forms of silica , made by crushing to various degrees of fineness a dull-colored quartz rock called flint . Silica , which is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of flint . The particles of silex which are made by crushing rock are in numerous rough shapes , such as wedges and needles , rather than in spherical forms . Such minute fragments will pack together with a proper binder and make a mass that will not easily break up or pulverize and come out of the cell cavities . Another good feature of silex is that when mixed with oils it becomes almost perfectly transparent ; and , unless it is packed in considerable masses or is colored with pigments , it does not obscure the grain to an appreciable extent . The resultant clearness or transparency of the finish depends to some extent upon the fineness to which the silex is ground , because its oil absorption also varies with the size of the particles . Silex , when unmixed with oil , is a white ground powder that is far from transparent . Ingredients Used in Paste Fillers . AIanv formulas have been used for making wood fillers . Certain ingredients , however , are likely to be found in all of them that give good results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filler , often called a pigment , preferably silex , but which may be China clay , barytes , whiting , cornstarch , and the like . The purpose of the body material is to provide a hard mass that will plug the open ends of cells and fill in all cell cavities that form depressions below the general level of the surface to be finished . Silex is not usually considered to be a pigment . 2 . A vehicle , usually boiled linseed oil ( raw linseed oil also gives good results ) , the functions of which are to act as a binder to the body material and to size the wood . 3 . A japan drier , generally a light brown japan , which acts as a drier , and helps as a binder for the mixture . 4 . A solvent or thinner , preferably turpentine , but which may be aliphatic or aromatic petroleum-base naphthas , such as gasoline , mineral spirit , or xvlol . The solvent practically all Wood Fillers 1.11 evaporates , but it thins the mixture so that it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Coloring matter , which usually consists of colors ground in oil , is added , in order to stain the filler or both the wood and the filler . The so-called natural or white fillers contain no coloring pigments . Most of the paste fillers now sold on the market are made with silex as a pigment or body for the filling mass . These ready-mixed fillers are put up in compression-top cans , containing 1 , 5 , 10 , or 25 pounds . Such containers will keep paste filler almost indefinitely , if the covers are driven tightly into place thereby sealing the can when the mixture is not used . Prepared fillers always must be remixed by stirring thoroughly , and usually require thinning with turpentine , naphtha , benzine , or even gasoline . Such fillers can be purchased under the following names : ebony ; red , brown , light , and dark mahogany ; natural or transparent ; antique , Antwerp , dark , and golden oak ; wal-nut ; special white and others ( Fig. 8-1 , pages 128A and B ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filler , which contains six to eight pounds of ready-mixed filler with thinner , cover as much as 300 square feet of sur-face . The area that can be covered with a given amount of paste filler varies greatly with the kind of wood and the ex-perience of the man . A practical formula for making " natural " or colored paste filler is as follows : ( a ) 2 quarts boiled linseed oil . 1 quart brown japan . 1/2 pint turpentine . Add silex gradually while mixing until a still mass is obtained . Some formulas suggest % to by weight of China clay instead of all silex . A better blending of substances is secured by permitting the pasty dough to stand one or two clays before thinning . Thin the silex mixture with turpentine or benzine to the proper thickness for application with a stiff brush . Color the filler with pigment colors ground in oil . If strong colors are required , it is often best to stain with oil-soluble coal-tar dyes rather than with pigment colors . If the mass of pigment color is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of silex , the // filler would be weakened in adhesion and would not be as firm a mass in the cells ; consequently aniline or other coal-tar colors are preferable in such cases . Colored paste fillers which are to go over stained or dark wood are generally made slightly darker in tone than the surfaces which are to be filled . This is clone because the wood slowly darkens with age and later on will be as dark as the filler which is used . IIome made fillers containing brown japan in large quanti ties should generally be used within two weeks . If the mixture is too old , it becomes somewhat hard and does not work into the pores as well as it does when it is fresher and softer . The solvents used in making paste fillers are very volatile ; therefore , it is important that the mixture be kept in cans or buckets having closely fitted covers so that the containers are practically air tight . Colored Pigments Used in Producing Special Paste Fillers . Painters ' pigments ground in oil are generally used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are mineral pigments in the form of powders , are sometimes used , but they are more opaque and weak in chroma . Manufacturers of fillers , however , furnish paste fillers colored to the standard tones or effects ; and these can be ob tained tinder such names as the following : natural or uncolored antique oak , golden oak , dark oak , mahogany , walnut , and the like . Special fillers for various kinds of wood can easily be mixed and colored . See Table IV . Quick-drying Fillers . With the speed-up in furniture pro duction , the drying time for fillers has been greatly reduced . This was accomplished by replacing linseed oil by a synthetic resin vehicle of a type used by paint manufacturers . Fillers prepared with this vehicle dry in 30-60 minutes . As a class , these fillers are difficult to use and are likely to cause greater trouble than the moat conventional , slow-drying kind . Lacking the lubricant property of linseed oil , they have a tendency to produce a tacky , sticky surface . To im prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slow-drying thinner may be added . When this is clone , it is well to follow the manufacturer 's directions as given on Wood Fillers 1-13 // // the container . A good all-around thinner is V ' I and P naph-tha . When adding thinner , allow additional shying time . Fail-ure to do this may cause a coat of lacquer to blush , giving the filler a grayish appearance. - Shorter drying schedules call for a fast grade of aromatic naphtha . Brushes and " Picking Sticks " for Filler . Three kinds of brushes are useful to the workman in applying filler : ( 1 ) a 3 " or 4 " coach cluster having rather fine stiff bristles makes an excellent brush for dusting and removing sand particles and broken wood fragments from wood surfaces that are to be filled . A house painter 's duster having rather fine stiff bristles may be used . ( 2 ) Special brushes for applying filler can be obtained of brush manufacturers . Filler brushes should be quite stiff , so that the bristles will be sure to enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood ( Fig. 9-5 ) . Brushes should he of good size and have plenty of bristles in order to hold considerable filler . An old half-worn or short-bristled flat paint brush may be used for large work . Oval or round brushes are preferable for small work , because they hold more filler where narrow brushes are needed . ( 3 ) Picking brushes are often needed for rubbing out the excess filler from uneven surfaces , such as carvings and moldings . Special very stiff and rather coarse-bristled brushes , with the handle on the back like a shoe-blacking brush , are made for this pur-pose , and can be bought on the market under the name of picking brushes . They should not be used where the filler can be rubbed off in the usual manner . Picking sticks , about 1 74 , 4u to to in diameter , and 6 " or 8 " long , may be made of maple dowel rods , or from close-grained hickory or some other similar wood . Frequently they are whittled and sanded with one wedge-shaped end for scraping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not he rubbed off . The other end generally tapers to a rather sharp point . Chisel-like scrapers of various sizes and shapes can be made at the ends of these picking sticks . Bone , horn , and old toothbrush handles are favored by some finishers as material for homemade picking sticks . A narrow strip of cotton cloth is frequently held tightly over the wedge-shaped end of the picking stick when removing the filler . If the filler becomes too hard , it may be necessary to dampen the cloth with tur-pentine when scraping out the comers where the mixture has dried too long . Brushing and Dusting Wood Before Filling . Experienced wood finishers make a practice of brushing wood surfaces with a stiff brush lengthwise of the grain just before filling . Such a brushing , if clone thoroughly , removes many loosened or 146 // broken fragments of cell walls that otherwise aright conk off after filling and leave specks or small defects . The cell cavities on the surface are also cleaned out of small fragments of sand and dust neither of which mixes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that brushing and dusting open up the pores of the wood and prepare the surface to receive a filler ( Fig. 9-6 ) . If the finishing room is equipped with compressed air , many loose particles and dust can be removed with the air hose . Sanding Water Stained Surfaces Before Filling . A cleaner , less muddy effect can be secured over water stained surfaces if they are given a wash coat of shellac and sanded after the shellac is thoroughly dry . Use dry sandpaper , 3/0 or 4/0 , held in the hand or over a felt pad , as water is not good for rubbing shellacked surfaces . The sanding must be clone very carefully , or streaks and corners will be sanded too much , and the even tone of the stain will be spoiled . The wash coat of shellac should consist of seven to ten parts of alcohol to one part of // liquid shellac . If the shellac has four pounds of gum to the gallon of denatured alcohol , a wash coat should consist of eight parts of denatured alcohol to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fibers that were raised above the general level of the surface by the staining process , and a light sanding removes all these fragments flush with the sur face . Wood filler can be rubbed crosswise from such a sur face leaving it clean and clear in appearance . Why Wash Coating Before Filling ? When a finish with a fairly light or bright undertone color and a dark or strong pore color is desired , it is common practice , prior to filling to apply a coat of wash shellac or lacquer sanding sealer The term " washcoating " as used in furniture finishing means the application of a very thin coat of sealer after stain ing and before filling . Its primary purpose is to prevent stain ing action by the filler . It also produces a smoother , harde surface , which facilitates wiping and cleaning of filled surfaces A washcoat must leave a very thin film ; otherwise it would seal off or bridge the large pores and prevent prope filling . Two types of washcoats are generally used : The firs and oldest is shellac , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut shellac to 7 or 8 parts of denatured alcohol A shellac washcoat dries within one hour . It sands to a smooth finish and takes filler nicely . Many finishers now use lacquer wash coats . So-called lac-quer sanding sealers may be bought ready to spray , or they may be thinned to washcoat consistency with lacquer thinner Sanding sealers dry to a hard coat and are ready for sanding in 30-60 minutes . Process of Filling . Filling wood with paste filler is not a difficult operation , but it requires knowledge of materials , and proper equipment , in addition to skill that comes from ex-perience and good methods of work . Preliminary processes of finishing may precede the application of filler . Sometimes the wood is stained and allowed to dry , and the filler is ap-plied over the stain . The filler may " lift " or raise the stain when this method is used . In order to prevent this change of shade , a wash consisting of a very thin coat of shellac is frequently put over the stain to hold it in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // If shellac of the standard or ordinary mixture is used , instead of a wash as suggested , the pores of the wood will be coated and filled with such a thick smooth covering that the wood filler will not stay in the pores on account of poor anchorage for the filler pigment or body material . Paste filler can be applied successfully over a wash coat of shellac without raising the stain or changing the shade or tone of the color . Sometimes an oil stain is applied and not rubbed ; and , after about 20 minutes , a filler is brushed crosswise over the wood , absorbing some of the excess stain . At other times filler that is either stained or " natual " is applied to unstained and tunshellacked wood surfaces as a first coat of finish . If a stained filler is used , the wood may be stained and filled in one operation . The stain in this case does not usually penetrate deeply into the wood , and the general tone is light because less color is absorbed by the wood from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staining . Greater penetration of the stain can be secured , however , by substituting about 15 or 20 per cent of benzol for that mach benzine in the solvent or thinner . Paste filler must be thinned to the proper consistency with turpentine , benzine , or naphtha before use . Should it be too thin it will not fill the pores of a coarse-grained wood which has large open cells , because it would contain too little pigment . On the other hand , if the filler is too thick , it will not enter the cell openings properly , especially when applied to woods composed largely of tracheids , or having tracheal vessels that are relatively small in size . Ordinarily , paste filler should be about as thick as paint or thick cream when it is applied . The finisher should remember , however , to use a thick filler on woods with large open pores and a rather thin filler on woods with small pores . Woods with very small pores , such as are found in the conifers , do not need a paste filler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filler . Linseed oil , preferably boiled , is sometimes painted over wood just before paste filler is applied , to prevent too great absorption of oil from the filler by the wood , thus reducing the binding qualities of the vehicle in the pores . If the filler has a proper anuonnt of oil mixed with it , the preliminary oiling is unnecessary . Oiling always darkens wood and is pleasing in some cases , as with black walnut ; it usually is displeasing with very light woods , such as pine and maple , and even with oak . Paste fillers that are to be used over surfaces that have had a shellac wash do not require as much oil in their com-position as those that are to be spread on unsized wood . Paste filler should he painted on the wood with a large , short-bristled , stiff brush , which should he kept moderately wet or full of the liquid ( Fig. 9-7 ) . The mixture in the can should be stirred often to keep the silex or body material from settling . The important thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass clown into the pores , and drive air bubbles out , thereby preventing specks or pinholes . This can be accomplished by working the filler into the pores by spread-ing it lengthwise of the grain , and by going over it crosswise with a rather wet brush . Some finishers apply filler lengthwise of the grain only , while others say it should he brushed on crosswise . The im-portant things are : to be sure ( 1 ) that the pasty mixture goes into the pores as deeply as possible ; and ( 2 ) that the cell cavities are completely filled . Paste filler does not set quickly , consequently there is no danger of spoiling a finish by working the surface over and over with a brush . Dulling or setting of paste filler for furniture usually re-quires about 20 minutes with most of the good ready-mixed commercial silex fillers of the present day . An excess of oil , 150 // the use of raw instead of boiled oil , and lack of proper driers ? all cause the filler to set slowly . The quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the filler dries too rapidly , add a little more linseed oil ; but one should remember that too much oil makes a sticky mass that may pull out of the pores because it is tough and not in a condition to wipe off properly , and also that an excess of oil in the filler may injure the varnish coats over it . A finisher should add japan drier up to about 1/2 pint to the gallon of filler , if there is too little binder and the mixture pulls out of the pores in rubbing . On the other hand , a filler which is too stiff , lacking in benzine or turpentine , will not brush into the pores properly , and is very apt to pull out of the cell cavities during the wiping process . Two very important rules should be remenibered , namely : first , paste fillers contain ingredients that readily settle to the bottom of the can or pail , and , therefore , it is very important that the mixture should be stirred thoroughly very often , at least once in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rub the filler at just the right time , because if it is ribbed too soon the filling mass will pull out of the pores , and if the finisher waits too long the excess of material above the surface that ought to be removed has dried too hard , and will not come off unless it is softened with turpentine or benzine Rubbing Paste Filler . Rubbing off the filler in such a manner as to leave well-filled pores and a level surface is the real test of a wood finisher 's skill . After painting on the filler the condition of the surface must be watched , and the excess of the dulled mixture should be rubbed off crosswise of the grain at the proper time . If the filler is rubbed too soon , before the thinner has evaporated , the thickening body mixture of silex and pigment will pull out of the pores because it has not had time to stiffen and form firm anchorages , and a poorly filled uneven surface will be the result ( Fig. 9-8 ) . If the finisher waits too long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and some of it may pull out of the pores , as it is too stiff , instead of being cut off just at the surface . The filler that has settled down into the ruptured cell cavities should not be disturbed , Mille all excess which is above the surface of the wood must rubbed or scraped off . Filler should be ribbed soon after // it has dulled and no longer looks wet , for prompt action at that time is necessary to secure good results . The finisher should not fill too large an area before lie begins the rubbing process . Various materials can be used for rubbing off the filler from wood surfaces . The newly filled floors of buildings are frequently rubbed with soft shavings , saw dust , or excelsior , because these substances cost little or nothing and are avail-able . Shops and furniture factories generally use better ma terial , such as hairlike sea moss or sea grass which is com monly used in upholstering , jute or flax , or hemp tow , rags , burlap , or even cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface . Almost anything will answer the purpose which is not too stiff and is somewhat absorbent , that will scrape or rub off the excess filler from the surface without digging it out of the pores . Crosswise rubbing of paste filler is the proper method , since rubbing lengthwise of the grain tears the filler out of the pores to a greater extent ( Fig. 9-9 ) . The finisher should obtain a handful or pad of jute tow , sea grass , or rags , and rid ) one surface after another crosswise with considerable pressure , taking more material as soon as that in the hand becomes too wet or full of filler . A cleaner surface can be obtained by making a few light strokes with cotton cloth or rags lengthwise of the grain in finishing the process , thus re-moving the crosslines of filler left by the first hard rubbing ( Figs. 9-10 and 11 ) . Two or more coats of filler are sometimes required to fill the pores completely . If the first coat is too thin , a second application is added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filler in the pores as well as horizontal surfaces , the mixture which is to be used on vertical surfaces should be quite thick , or it may run out of the pores . Examination will show whether the pores are full of the filling material . A second coat can best be applied as soon as the first one has become set or chill . After a filler has been rubbed , it is wise for an inexperienced workman to examine portions of v arions surfaces of a filled article using a pocket magnifier of from 12 to 18 enlargements . A hand glass of even lower magnification will help . If the filling is not well clone , the 153 glass will show it instantly ( Fig. 9-12 ) . Additional coats of filler can be applied , if the pores are not full , after rubbing off the excess from the first application . It is thought best by many finishers to paint another coat of rather thin filler over the rubbed surface as soon as possible , at least before the mass in the pores is thoroughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rubbed when it has set just as was the previous application ; and , usually , a satisfactory level surface properly filled is the result . Sometimes a second or third coat is given to a filled surface that has dried hard . // Drying Paste Filler . The rapidity of drying of paste filler depends upon atmospheric conditions , such as warmth and dryness , and also upon the amount and the kind of oil used , the quantity of driers , and the volatility of the solvents . Raw linseed oil in the mixture and damp cool air check or slow up the drying of filler in wood . Under ordinary shop conditions most of the standard paste fillers sold on the market should have at least 48 hours to dry before shellac or any other finish is applied over them . Sanding can generally he done after 24 hours . Oxidation of linseed oil , especially raw oil , is a slow process ; and , as there is linseed oil in paste fillers , plenty of time must he allowed for the drying of the filler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article is varnished . Spraying Fillers . In most commercial shops the filling of pores of open-grained woods is done by means of a spray gun . The saving of time is considerable . With the proper equipment , one man can spray-fill as many pieces as four men can do in brush-filling . To do the job of spray-filling properly , a pressure tank with agitators is needed . The agitators prevent the settling of the heavy pigments . The spray gun used has a special tip , needle , and air cap . A heavy , wet coat is applied at 30-50 lbs . air pressure . Correct pressure is important , since excess pressure may cause the filler to dry too quickly , causing what is known as " pinholing . " In pinholing , a thin layer of filler breaches the pores , but does not fill them properly . During the drying process , the air escapes , breaking the film , and in so doing leaves a number of small holes . Special machines are used to pad the filler into the pores , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a small amount of hand filling and clean-up are often necessary . Sandpapering a Filled Surface . Filling always leaves a slightly rough surface , which should be sanded very lightly with No. 00 and No. 000 sandpaper . Small fragments of filler may be left on the surface after rubbing ; the filled surfaces in the cell cavities may be slightly rough or not quite level , as revealed by a magnifier ; and in addition to these , the fuzz on the surface of the wood may have been very slightly raised by the Sul in the filler or the solvents that were used to make it spread to better advantage ( Fig. 9-13 ) . Fine sandpaper should be used , and it should be handled with great care to prevent cutting through at corners and other exposed places . The inexperienced finisher should be warned to sand lengthwise of the grain with light strokes , or his work may he damaged . The sandpaper should not be placed over a hard block and used in that manner , for streaks and spots may be cut through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously . Soft felt blocks should be used , or the paper may he held over the hand for much of the sanding . Fine water-proof garnet finishing paper , over a felt pad well moistened with water , can be used to advantage over filled surfaces ( Fig. 9-14 ) . // The appearance is often improved by wiping a filled sur-face with a cloth moistened with benzine as a final operation after the sanding has been completed . Small particles of sand and fragments of wood together with any muddiness from excess portions of filler , are removed leaving an effect of greater transparency as a result of the wiping operation . Common Filler Troubles . ' Some of the troubles most frequently encountered in the application of fillers are the fol-lowing : Graying . When graying of filler occurs , the filler takes on a milky , gray cast . This may be caused by : 1 . A lack of sufficient drying time . // 2 . The use of a wrong thinner to reduce the filler to proper brushing or spraying consistency . 3 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of too much boiled linseed oil . 5 . Too little oil , resulting in insufficient wetting of the pigment particles . 6 . Improper formulation by the manufacturer . 7 . Incorrect choice of the sealer used . Bleeding . This trouble is often related to poor drying . When a surface is sealed before the solvents in the filler have had a chance to dry properly , the sealer penetrates the filler and mixes with the filler solvents . As the surface dries , any soluble coloring matter comes out with the escaping solvents , causing spots around the pores . To avoid bleeding , apply light rather than heavy sealer coats . Popping or Puffing . The solvents in some lacquer sealers have a tendency to dissolve any undried oils . This results in an increase in the volume of the filler , creating a rough " washboard " effect . As the solvents escape , the surface levels off due to the subsequent shrinkage of the filler . This shrinkage is what causes the trouble . Muddy color . This is often due to fillers which contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , careless and improper removal of filler may leave this muddy appearance . Pinholing . When filler is sprayed on with excessive pressure or when the filler is not brushed thoroughly into the pores , pinholing may result . Although the pores may be breached with a thin film of filler , these films break upon drying . Small holes in the surface are the result . To secure good filling results , follow these suggestions : 1 . Select a filler that has maximum safety built into it . 2 . Apply and remove filler properly . 3 . Allow for sufficient drying time . 4 . Avoid excessively heavy sealer coats . Certain Woods Require a Paste Filler . A complete enumeration of all woods that require paste filler would he hard to prepare , but a list of typical species may be of assistance . As a // general rule , woods that have open pores or cell cavities that are plainly visible to the naked eye should be filled with a paste filler . A wood that has been colored with an oil stain contain ing linseed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one stained with a water stain . For this reason woods having fine cell openings , such as birch , are frequently filled after a water stain ; and , generally , they are not filled after application of linseed oil stain , because the drying oil mixed with the color sizes the wood and plugs the cell openings to some extent . The volatile oil stains made from a solvent and an oil-soluble coal-tar dye do not size wood much more than water stain . The list of woods in Table V , based largely on the size of the cell cavities , is suggestive in deciding whether a given kind of wood should be filled with a paste filler , but it must be remembered that special types of finishes for unusual effects may be the determining factor . In some cases Table V shows the name of a wood in two columns . This indicates that at least two methods of finishing these woods are commonly used , and that both methods are considered to be good under certain conditions . Paste Fillers Are Best on Floors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the reason that liquid fillers are not satisfactory on any kind of wood used for floors . More suitable finishes for floors can be obtained by treating all kinds of flooring , both hardwoods and softwoods , with a paste filler in order to give a good foundation of very hard , non-absorptive , long wearing material as an undercoat for varnish . All woods are porous , because cavities or openings exist in all kinds of cells in the various woods . The microscope shows the closest grained nonporous woods to be full of cells , and the end grain of such a wood , under a glass , appears like a sieve . The finest particles of a properly ground silex are small enough to lodge to some extent in the cells of even the closest grained wood and plug up or fill the cell openings . // Chapter X Spirit Varnishes Spirit Varnishes Defined . Shellac , dammar , mastic , and sandarac varnishes are quick-drying , well-known finishes which are often called spirit varnishes . The term spirit varnish has a slightly different meaning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . Abroad , the term spirit varnish refers to a mixture made from one or more gums or resins that may be dissolved in alcohol , turpentine , acetone , or similar volatile solvents , but which contains no drying oils such as linseed oil or tong oil . In some foreign countries , it is customary to classify alcoholic spirit varnishes and turpentine spirit varnishes in one group . In the United States , two groups are sometimes made , gums or resins dissolved in alcohol being called spirit varnishes while those cut with turpentine are called volatile oil varnishes . Other American authorities use the foreign classification . In this book , the two groups are classed together , and the term spirit varnish refers to solu tions of gums , or resins and volatile liquids . Some resins such as dammar , mastic , and elemi are largely soluble in both alco hol and turpentine . 161 // Resins Used in Spirit Varnishes . Various resins , frequently in mixtures , are used in spirit varnishes . The solvents which are most commonly selected are turpentine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either wholly or in part , in benzol or ether . It should be remembered , however , that some resins are largely or entirely soluble in turpentine and only partly soluble in alcohol . In other cases the reverse is true . The lists on page 161 indicate the solvents that can be used with several of the resins . TuREE USEFUL SOFT GUM VARNISHES Dammar Varnish . The best known of the clear or transparent varnishes sold in limited amount on the American market is called dammar varnish . This resin , classed as a soft resin , comes from Indonesia , is harder than rosin , but is much softer than arc the copals in general . Dammar resin is frequently disc solved in turpentine in which substance it is almost completely soluble ; while , if alcohol is the solvent , there is about 29 per cent residue remaining which is soluble . Other solvents which are sometimes used in dammar varnishes are carbon tetrachloride , benzine , heavy naphtha 48 ? , and heavy benzol . Dammar varnish when spread upon a surface does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it have the durability of good fixed-oil varnishes which include linseed oil or some other drying oil in their composition . In such finishes , the turpentine , alcohol , or other volatile solvent dries out leaving a thin film consisting of the gum or gums spread over the surface Like other spirit varnishes , dammar varnish dries rapidly , because the solvents used evaporate quickly leaving a rather glossy and moderately hard film . Dammar varnish is used on light or white surfaces at times in place of a fixed-oil varnish , which would usually slightly darken the tone on account of the presence of drying oils . The film or coat left by applying dammar varnish is not very durable because the resin becomes weak in cohesion and gradually rubs off . This varnish should be applied quickly ? much as shellac is flowed over a surface ? because it dries quite rapidly after being spread with a brush . Dammar varnish , with its greater transparency as compared with oil varnishes or even shellac , is used occasionally // to preserve the natural color of wood or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are popular , dammar varnish is often used for finishing boxes , plates , wastebaskets , and other small articles of basswood or holly in order to keep the unburned portions of the designs as light in tone as possible . Dammar varnish has been used rather largely by paint manufacturers to impart a gloss to paints , and is sometimes mixed with zinc whit ( . in the preparation of white enamels because it contains no linseed oil which is apt to turn yellow with long exposure to light . Dammar resin is produced by various living pinaccons trees of the genus Dammam , which grow in Indonesia chiefly , and to a minor extent in Australia and New Zealand . The best dammar resin comes in five grades from the island of Java , and is known as Batavia . Other dammar resins sold on the market are shipped from Padang , Sumatra , Borneo , and Singapore Dammar varnish is made up in varying proportions of resin and solvent , the following being suggestive : Transparent Picture Varnish : A tougher more elastic dammar varnish : The following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) specification for dammar varnish : Composition 1. - To consist exclusively of a solution of pure ( laminar resin in petroleum spirits ( turpentine substitute ) and to be absolutely free from all foreign matter . To contain not less than 55 per cent nor more than 60 per cent by volume of petroleum spirits . Mastic Varnish . The most important European resin , with the exception of colophony ( col'o-pho-ny ) or colophonium , which are other names for common rosin , is mastic , which // comes largely from Chios , one of the Greek islands located in the Aegean sea . Similar resins are found in some parts of Greece , Africa , and Syria . Mastic resin is the product of exudation from the lentix tree ( Pistacia lentiscus ) , also called the Pistacia , a Mediterranean evergreen tree . The resin is thrown out in response to wounds , which are vertical incisions in the bark , and is collected in the form of spherical or slightly flattened tears or grains . After being exuded from a wound the liquid resin gradually becomes dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chewing gum , though it has a slightly bitter taste . Its odor is , however , rather agreeable and pleasing . Mastic gum soon softens when placed in the mouth and crushed between the teeth ; while sandarac , a somewhat similar resin , is crushed into powder . A lentix tree in good condition yields as much as eight to ten pounds of mastic r ! rsin per year , if properly cared for during the gum-producing season . The tree , which is sometimes called the lentiscus , is hardly more than a shrub , usually growing to the height of only ten or twelve feet . Mastic resin , when it appears on the market , is of a pale yellowish or slightly greenish color . It is a very soft resin , fusing at a temperature slightly below the boiling point of water ( 95 ? C. ) . The gum , however , begins to soften at a temperature of about 85 ? C. The active ingredient in mastic resin is known as mastic acid ( C , ) . Mastic resin is used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of transparent or colorless varnishes , being completely soluble in turpentine , ether , and benzol , and largely soluble in acetone . In alcohol , about 36 per cent of insoluble matter is left as a residue . Petrol ether has only a slight solvent action on the gum . Artists are the chief users of various kinds of mastic varnish . It is often mixed in small quantities with turpentine and boiled linseed oil and used as a vehicle in mixing with artists ' oil paints , thus giving more luster to paintings than would be produced by using either linseed oil or turpentine or a mixture of both . One form of mastic varnish , known as " nlegilp , " contains boiled linseed oil in its composition and is rather thick or // gelatinous . " Megilp " is used by artists in connection with oil paintings . A portion of mastic resin is sometimes mixed with dammar and other gums in order to make the resultant varnish more elastic and tough . Sandarac . Another resin that is completely soluble in alcohol is sandarac , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cypress or juniper and which is indigenous to North Africa , especially Algeria and Morocco . The Moors collect the sandarac resin which is exuded to some extent naturally from the trees . Incisions are made in the bark , from which the tree throws out sandarac resin , much as the longleaf and loblolly pines of the southern part of the United States exude crude turpentine gum , the raw material from which turpentine and rosin are manufactured . Sandarac is a rather hard member of the group of soft resins , and has a specific gravity of 1.073 , which is high for a resin . On account of its hardness , toughness , elasticity , and great luster , it is sometimes mixed with shellac gum in the production of alcohol-soluble varnishes . It was at one time often chosen as an ingredient of compounds , called lacquers , used to cover brass and other metals to prevent tarnishing . Sandarac resin is also selected as an ingredient of various alcoholic spirit varnishes , known as bookbinders ' varnishes , label varnishes , and photographic-negative varnishes . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form of small , rather elongated , hitter tears or globules , which are of a pale yellowish color and have a slightly bitter taste , and a faint odor . The resin will not soften in the mouth in an attempt at chewing and can , by that means , be distinguished from mastic gum . Sandarac resin fuses at a temperature of about 145 ? C. Other solvents for sandarac besides alcohol are ether and acetone . It is also partly soluble in chloroform ( 44 per cent ) , turpentine ( 26.4 per cent ) , and benzine ( 32.6 per cent ) . SIII ? LLAC VARNISH-PREPARATION , APPLICATION Lac Cum . Shellac , the best known and by far the most important of all the spirit varnishes , is made from a rather hard resin called lac , which is shipped throughout the world // principally from Calcutta , India . The resin itself is heavy for a material of this kind , and has a specific gravity varying from 1.113 to 1.214 . The lac gum or shellac of commerce is almost completely soluble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent of residue which is known as shellac was . Shellac gum is , however , almost insoluble in dilute mineral acids , ether , linseed oil , and turpentine ( 90.9 per cent ) , although this last solvent , especially Venice turpentine is sometime added to liquid shellac for special reasons . It is interesting to know that shellac gum is soluble in ammonia and alkaline solu-tions . The alkalies generally used for a mixture of this kind , which is known as a water shellac , are borax and alkaline car-bonates . The market quotations show various grades of shellac gum , the best and highest priced being known as D.C. , V.S.0. , and Diamond L Other cheaper grades are superfine orange , fine , T.N. ( " Truly Native " ) , garnet lac , button lac , and bleached ( ground ) ; the poorer grades being given last . // Shellac gum , a resin commonly called lac or " lakh " ( meaning 100,000 ) , is produced by certain scale insects on various species of trees which are found especially in northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bengal . Lac resin at present is produced in Bengal , Siam , China , Ceylon , Burma , and the ' Malayan Archipelago ; but Calcutta , India , remains the great market place and shipping port for this important industry . The insect which excretes the lac is commonly called the Coccus lacca , but is also known as Tachardia lacca , and Carteria lacca . The insects incrust most commonly the twigs of various fig trees which are sometimes spoken of as the Ficus ( Fig. 10-1 and 2 ) . In various places they are found on 88 species and varieties of trees , including the mimosa , the acacia , the dalbergia tree which produces the rosewood of commerce , and also on India rubber and banyan trees . The deep red insects , about 7 " 1,2 " long while young , attach themselves to live twigs where they can puncture the bark with their beaks and stick up the sap from the growing stems . Important changes take place in each insect which exudes , through the pores of its body a resinous material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimately cover the twigs with a thick layer , much as ice forms on branches of trees in winter in this country . The female insects , which are far more numerous than the males , form most of the incrustation of gum about themsel es , and there they remain practically immovable In one of these cells , later on , each female insect lays about 1000 eggs . Sometimes the lac may cover the twigs to a thickness of from ' , 1+ " to ' i ' 2 " The insects are not active and have little vitality , but they are so numerous at times while feeding gregariously with their bodies closely packed together , that they give a red color to the branches of the trees . Trees can he inoculated from infested stems so as to produce crops either in late spring or late autumn . It should be noted , however , that individual trees are trimmed but once it year , generally in June or February . Slick lac is the name given to the incrusted twigs of even length alter they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the exuded and coalesced scales of lac , // are gathered about the time that the feeding or sucking of sap stops and before the young insects hatch out ; and in this condition they can be shipped or used to inoculate other trees . The spring crop is said to be used to a large extent for propagating purposes , and is not of as much importance for gathering for the market as is the autumn or winter crop . The color of stick lac on the twigs varies from a dark red to a rather pale orange yellow . When they are used to infest new trees , the young insects come out of the cells , which form around the bodies of the mother insects , and move about until they find a place to attach themselves , and thus a new crop is started . When lac dye was valuable it was important to gather the stick lac before the departure of the young ; for , after that time , the red fluid found in the cell of gum about the female insect 's body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken into sticks of even lengths , and the particles which fall to the ground in fragments under the trees , are gathered at some // place where the resin is first scraped from the branches and then crushed ( Fig. 10-3 ) . Frequently this is done in a mill similar to that used for breaking up grain . By sifting and sort ing , the fragments of wood and the bodies of the insects are removed ; and the crude lac , then called seed lac , is washed in hot water ( Fig. 10-4 ) . A purple or reddish dye , which was quite valuable before the recent discoveries in aniline and other coal-tar colors , is removed by washing and is lolown as lac dye . This dye , at one time more valuable than shellac itself , was supposed to he the same as cochineal , but chemists finally discovered that it contains a different acid . The cleaning proc ess is completed by sifting and winnowing the seed lac ( Fig. 10-5 ) . In manufacturing shellac the dried seed lac is mixed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 0.25 per cent , and also with varying small amounts of rosin , an adulter ant that is much cheaper than shellac gum and does not seem to be harmful up to 3 to 5 per cent , but which is very advarntageous to the workmen because it makes the melting of the seed lac much easier . The mixture is then placed in long thin cotton bags , which are about the size of a baseball bat , except that sometimes they are nearly 20 feet long . When the bags are heated over a charcoal fire and twisted in opposite 10-6 . Native method of shellac manufacture . The seedlac is first put into cloth bags , shaped like a 2 " water hose . By holding the filled bags before a charcoal fire , the lac melts and is forced out by twisting the bag . . directions by two men , the melted resin oozes out through the meshes of the cloth and is scraped off and spread out over a large porcelain cylinder containing cold water ( Figs. 10-6 and 7 ) . After cooling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stretched into thinner sheets several feet square in size ( Fig. 10-8 ) . While the resin is being squeezed from the bags some of it chops to the ground , and makes little flakes known as button lac . The buttons are usually of a dark ruby color , and when sold on the market they frequently have from 10 to 20 per cent of rosin mixed with the shellac gum , thus cheapening it . Carnet laic is another grade which is sold in sheets , and is said to have had the shellac wax largely removed . This grade on the market , however , generally has from 10 to 20 per cent of rosin mixed with it to reduce the cost and to lower its fusion teniperatnre . Carnet lac is often made from the residue which will not slncezc ont of the bags . The shellac gum is removed 17t // from the impurities by the use of alcohol or sodium carbonate solution ; and after filtering , the solvent is liberated , or acid is used to destroy the alkali . Stick lac in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contains about 66 per cent of lac resin , six per cent shellac wax , six per cent gluten , and eleven per cent coloring matter . Shellac wax is not soluble in alcohol and , if present in liquid shellac , is the cause of its turhid appearance . Alcoholic Solutions of Shellac Gum . Wood finishers purchase shellac varnish ready for use . It is prepared in factories where the shellac gum , also called shellac resin , is dissolved , usually in denatured grain ( ethyl ) alcohol , or in wood ( methyl ) alcohol . Formerly , wood alcohol shellac was commonly used because it sold at a much lower price than shellac gum dissolved in grain alcohol , which was expensive because of a high government tax . Wood alcohol shellac is not much used at present because of its poisonous qualities , its strong disagreeable odor , and the difficult , in application . It sets so rapidly that brushing it on smoothly is almost impossible , especially when it is attempted by inexperienced workmen . This kind of shellac is not used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbing pad . Bleached shellac is not entirely soluble in wood alcohol . Strong or highproof denatured alcohol , such as the United States Revenue Bureau 's formula No. 1 , which consists of 100 gallons of 190 ? proof ethyl ( grain ) alcohol and five gallons of approved methyl ( wood ) alcohol , is necessary for dissolving shellac guns . The ordinary 160 ? proof ethyl alcohol , which is the grade fl-c ( iuently sold on the market , is not strong enough to dissolve shellac ginn satisfactorily . Ilighproof denatured alcohol , which is poisoned with five per cent of wood alcohol in the United States , is consequently the solvent commonly used in dissolving shellac gain . Denatured-alcohol shellac sets more slowly than that made with wood alcohol , and for this reason it spreads better with a brush . This mixture hardens sooner than that cut with wood alcohol and does not have its pungent smell which is so irritating to most people . Grain alcohol has a great affinity for water and easily absorbs it in clamp weather . Very small quanSpirit // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or turbid appearance ; for this reason the alcohol used should be at least 190 ? proof , which is the same as 95 per cent pure . Great care must be taken to keep water out of shellac , because even a few drops which have fallen into the mixture will cause precipitation of some of the gum , and any measurable quantity will change the liquid into a slimy coagulated mass that is useless . If a briish is wet with water when it is put into the liquid shellac , it will cause the same trouble , ruining the mixture and making the brush unusable . The proportion of shellac resin to the alcohol solvent varies somewhat . A thick shellac varnish which is sometimes called standard may be made by using the following : 5 pounds bleached shellac resin or gum to the gallon of 190 ? proof denatured alcohol ; or 4 pounds orange shellac resin to the gallon of 190 ? proof denatured alcohol . These proportions make a very thick shellac varnish , and it will be necessary to warm and agitate the mixture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some extra heavy shellacs are made in the proportion of 6 , ' % pounds to the gallon of solvent . The cutting of shellac resin is a slow and difficult process , and is best left to experienced men who have proper equipment in factories . Good grades of shellac varnish sold on the market are supposed to have four pounds of gum to the gallon of denatured alcohol . The cheaper grades of liquid shellac are apt to he made of some of the poorer adulterated gums and contain less than four pounds or frequently only three pounds of shellac resin to the gallon . Most of the thick shellac varnishes should be thinned before use . A mixture of two pounds of orange shellac or two and one-half pounds of bleached shellac is usually heavy enongb for application on wood . Effects of Metal Cans and Dust on Shellac Varnish . It is nnforttmate that liquid shellac as prepared by the manufactm-ers does not keep well in metal cans . After a few months , shellac whic=h is kept in metal cans gradually darkens . This discoloration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three ears , and can always be noticed in the contents of it till can that has been opened but not used promptly . The // dark color can sometimes be removed by the addition of a very few white crystals of oxalic acid to the shellac mixture . The use of oxalic acid in shellac varnish is a very questionable practice , however ; because , if there is an excess over that which is necessary to remove the discoloration in the shellac , the acid may bleach the stain under the shellac , or lighten the tone of the wood itself . Some manufacturers put up their product in glass bottles in order to avoid all discoloration that comes from contact with metal . Experts recommend that pre-pared shellac varnish be kept away from strong light , and in a reasonably warm room during cold weather , in order to pre-vent settling of the resin . If a can or bottle of shellac is not kept tightly corked serious trouble will soon follow , because the alcohol will evaporate very rapidly , and after a time the thickened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solution will spread properly under a brush . The most serious trouble that comes from leaving a shellac can open , comes from dust which soon settles into the mixture . Every speck of dust that goes into an open can of either shellac or varnish means a speck in a finish after it is applied to a surface , and this speck can never be removed . Shellac varnish that has stood open in a room for any great length of time is always ruined for wood finishing . Orange and White Shellac . The natural color of most grades of lac gum that have not been bleached is some shade of orange , the depth of tone varying with the grade . The best grades of orange shellac are not as apt to be adulterated with resin as the bleached . If more than a rather small per cent of rosin is present in shellac varnish , it will prevent the film from drying on a surface as hard as it should , leaving the finish tacky for a number of hours . Orange shellac when dissolved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a film made with it is stronger and more elastic ; and , in addition to these good qualities , the gum and prepared mixtures keep better . Alco-holic solutions of orange shellac do not depreciate in quality through rather long periods of storage , and are far more stable than is the case with white shellac solutions , which gradually deteriorate and become darker in color . Orange shellac is objectionable for many purposes on account of its color . // Bleached or white shellac is made from the various orange or colored shellacs by several processes . The coloring matter consisting of red lac dye can be removed by the use of various weak alkaline solvents . Sometimes the orange shellac resin is boiled in a weak solution of carbonate of potash , melted under water , and pulled till it is white . Another process is to dissolve the gum in some alkali and pass a stream of chlorine gas into the mixture to bleach the shellac , which is then melted under water and pulled when soft . Treatment with hypochlorite of soda or potash , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and washing in an elaborate process , is a commercial method . Bleached shellac is sold on the market in a coarse granular or ground form in order to make it more soluble in alcohol . Sometimes it is obtainable in large hanks which keep to better advantage . The bleaching process reduces its solubility , leaves it in a condition so that it is very apt to deteriorate with age , and renders a spirit varnish made with it less elastic than that made from the untreated orange resin . Bleached shellac dissolves in alcohol much more readily soon after it is mamrfactured . The gum gradually deteriorates with age or storage , and its solubility in alcohol is greatly reduced . White shellac varnish when spread on a surface produces an effect of great brilliancy and unequalled transparency . It dries very hard , however , but on account of its lack of elasticity it is apt to crack if it is bent or exposed to unusual conditions . Use of Shellac . Spirit varnishes made from shellac gum in solution are used for many purposes , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trimmings , the making of toys , furniture , and musical instruments , for sizing or stiffening straw hats , for many kinds of insulating in electrical instruiuent manufacture , for some kinds of waterproofing , for the making of leather dressings , and sometimes in the place of oil varnish for an undercoat on willow , rattan , and paper fiber goods . It is often the most desirable material known to use as a first coating over close-grained or nonporous woods , and to size stained and filled work so that varnish or wax may be iised sm-ccssfully later on . Shellac varnish is superior to other v ; u-nishes ill noupermeable qualities , because it almost her176 Coloring , Finishing , and Painting Wood metically seals up the pores of wood , closes up resin ducts , thereby preventing exudation from knots and pockets , and pre-vents the " bleeding " of stain into the final coats of varnish . Manufacturers of spar varnish , however , object to the use of shellac undercoats , because shellac does not weather as well as these " long-oil " varnishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use shellac under spar varnish on all woodwork that is exposed to outdoor conditions . Spirit varnish made from orange shellac gum and alcohol is used commonly by pattern makers , and to some extent by other woodworkers . When a shellac varnish is applied to dark-hued woods , it is quite common to use a mixture of orange and white shellac . Too much orange shellac in such a mixture is apt to give an orange tint that spoils the natural line of some woods or changes the color effect of the stain . For this reason white shellac is preferable for most finishes , especially for light tones . Spreading shellac is one of the very most difficult operations the wood finisher is called upon to perform . The alcohol in the mixture evaporates so rapidly from a shellac film that it is almost impossible to avoid laps , steaks , and untouched spots unless one has had considerable skill and experience . As a transparent filler or surfacer on woods without open pores , there is no other finishing material equal to denatured alcohol white shellac . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is wise to dilute liquid shellac of ordinary strength , such as a mixture of four pounds of gum to the gallon of alcohol , by using about one-half alcohol and one-half liquid shellac . Two coats of thin shellac , with a slight sanding between the applica-tions , will make a much better finish than one heavy coat ; chiefly because it is mach easier to spread thin shellac evenly , and also on account of the greater probability of covering every portion of the surface by going over it twice witli a brush . Shellac must be applied to wood with great speed by the use of a wet brush and spreading lengthwise of the grain . The operator should stand in a position from which he can see just what lie is doing , thus avoiding laps , streaks , and uncovered places . Frequently , it is possible to place the object between the finisher and the light by shifting it into such a position that the freshly covered surface will show a bright gloss where it // has been shellacked . Every portion of the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being put on , for after about one-half minute no touching up can be done satisfactorily . Attempts to retouch tacky shellac often cause trouble , as rough places will result which generally harm the finish more than uncovered spots do because these small areas will be covered over by later coats of finish and usually do not show unless an effort is made to repair them after the film has partially set . Drying and Sanding Shellacked Surfaces . Shellac dries hard , usually in abort eight hours , ready for sanding with fine sandpaper . While two coats of shellac can probably be put on during one clay , it is best that a full clay should elapse between applications . Great care and fine sandpaper must he used when smoothing and cutting off the gloss of shellac films , especially when thin mixtures have been applied . It both the shellac coat and the stain are cut through by careless sanding , it is very difficult to make a repair that will not show . A thoughtless finisher with sandpaper in his hands can do more damage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours . Shellac Washes . Washcoats of shellac are frequently used under paste filler in order to size the wood and keep the stain from raising with the filler when it is rnbhed . Washcoats are made of thin shellac in the proportion of one part of standard liquid shellac to seven or eight parts of alcohol . Mixtures as thin as one to ten are usually satisfactory tinder paste filler . The proportion of one to seven is considered bast when using a four-pound gums compound for the liquid shellac portion . Methods of Making Shellac Spread More Easily . Camphor gum is sometimes dissolved in liquid shellac in the proportion of one ounce of camphor to a gallon of shellac in order to make the mixture spread more easily tinder the brush . Small quantities of camphor gum are frequently put in spirit varnishes made of shellac , sandarac , and mastic cut in alcohol . A weak solution of glycerine and alcohol may be added to shellac varnish . Its action is similar to that of camphor gum because it retards the setting .

For the ordinary liquid shellac , this means that about five ounces of Venice turpentine may be added to each gallon of prepared shellac varnish . Venice turpentine also makes shellac spread considerably easier under the brush because it length-ens the time between the application and the setting of the film . Effects of Moisture on Shellac . Damp weather may cause trouble when spreading shellac on account of the affinity of alcohol for water . If the film has a greenish line or is not trarns-parent showing a turbid , cloudy appearance , the finisher should stop work until conditions are suitable . During rainy weather the shop windows should be closed . If the room is too cold , shellac will not spread well . Thin shellac varnish will , however , spread better in damp weather than will a thicker mixture . The effect of humid air on shellac can usually be seen if a finisher attempts to spread bleached or white shellac varnish over a dark colored wood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film is apt to turn white or yellowish white because the rapid evaporation of the alcohol changes the temperature of the surface enough to cause moisture to condense and leave light streaks where the brush has applied the shellac . As soon as the water in the film dries out , the proper color is almost always restored . If white shellac is mixed with a small amount of orange shellac , or slightly colored with a spirit dye , the discoloration from moisture is greatly reduced or is less obvious . Good and Bad Qualities of Shellac . A film of shellac is an excellent finish in several respects : it forms an unexcelled binder between filler and varnish coats ; it does not show white when scratched ; it seals the pores of fine-grained work satis-factorily ; it is very transparent ; it does not often cloud or darken wood appreciably ; and it makes a hard surface which is a good undercoat for other finishes . It is the best surfacer known for preventing pitch from exuding from knots ; but it may disintegrate after becoming damp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitable for outdoor finishes . All of the lac gums except garnet lac contain various amounts of shellac wax , which is practically insoluble in alSpirit // cohol . In manufacturing bleached or white shellac , an attempt is made to remove the wax , and , as a result , only three to four per cent of this insoluble matter remains . If any shellac wax is left in a shellac varnish , it may cause trouble after a coating of such an unpurified shellac has been spread over a surface . The wax can be separated out to a considerable extent by filtering the liquid shellac ; the wax being removed in the alcohol , as it is usually insoluble . Moisture contained in bleached shellac gum itself may also cause a milky appearance , sometimes showing this effect later on , especially on French polished or rubbed shellac surfaces . Shellac , on account of its acid nature , is affected by various alkalies . Ammonia which is found in the air , especially when present in unusual quantities , soon reacts with a shellac film and decomposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by washing it with a strong solution of soap and water . Shellac softens at a very low temperature and melts at a very moderate heat , this fact being shown by its manufacture . The heat of a charcoal fire causes the crude lac gum to melt and ooze through the meshes of a cloth bag . A thin film or coating of shellac varnish shows the same sensitiveness to heat ; consequently , articles of furniture that are finished with shellac , even though covered with an oil varnish , should not be placed near a fire nor left outdoors in intense sunlight . Films of shellac are apt to blister if they are heated much above ordinary room temperature . Rubbing Shellacked Surfaces . Every coat of shellac should be rubbed in some way before the next layer of finish is applied , the chief reasons for which are : ( 1 ) a more level surface is obtained by this operation , especially if sandpaper is used ; and ( 2 ) a dull , rougher surface is produced which causes better adherence of the next coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick to an unrubbed undercoat of shellac , however . Undercoats of shellac may be rubbed with very fine sandpaper , preferably using No. 3/0 or No. 4/0 in order that the finish may not be scratched and to prevent cutting through the coats of shellac and stain thus producing light spots or streaks . The sandpaper may be held in the hand for sanding the edges , especially , or it may be bent over a very soft-faced felt or rubber block when used on large surfaces .
