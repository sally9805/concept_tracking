Resorting to emergency techniques much the same as those used recently in Puerto Rico , British cleanup squads sprayed detergents along the coast of Cornwall after the tanker Torrey Canyon went aground last year . Scientists now report that the detergents did more damage to marine life than did the oil . <P> After months of study , Plymouth Laboratory Director J. E. Smith and his colleagues calculated that thousands of sea birds died from being coated with oil or from swallowing it . But except for the rosy-footed summer tourist , few other shore or sea creatures were seriously bothered by the oil . The detergents , however , killed a significant amount of sea life and seriously upset the ecology in many coastal areas . <P> Thousands of plants along the coast were destroyed or stunted by the chemicals . On one reef , lobsters , shrimp and crabs were virtually wiped out , starfish and sea urchins vanished . In tidal zones , limpets and other browsing creatures that keep shore lines free of decayed material and control the growth of seaweed were decimated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overgrown with seaweed this year . <P> During their research , British scientists discovered evidence that the detergent was the prime killer . Where wind and tides had shielded an occasional oil-spattered cove or bay , most flora and fauna survived .
