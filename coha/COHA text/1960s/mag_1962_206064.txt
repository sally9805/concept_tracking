Representatives and Senators gathering for this week 's opening of the 87th Congress . Second Session , found the Capitol Hill landscape somewhat rearranged . The giant new $100 million House office building , only a web of rusty girders when Congress adjourned last September , was resplendent in a coat of white Georgia marble , though it will not be ready for occupancy for at least another year . New parapet lights illuminated the ornate designs on the Senate 's arched ceiling , which have generally been shrouded in darkness since Constantino Brumidi painted them nearly a century ago . Space inside the reconstructed east front of the Capitol has been used to give both House and Senate large , tastefully appointed new dining rooms , along with several dozen handsome hideaways for high-seniority Congressmen . <P> But the membership of the Congress has not changed-and neither has its temper . That fact can only spell trouble for President Kennedy 's domestic legislative program . " We look and we look , " says a top Kennedy aide , " but it 's hard to see much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate , with 64 Democrats and 36 Republicans , is likely to go along with the President on most issues , just as it did in 1961 . The House is a different matter . There , though Demo crats ostensibly outnumber Republicans 263 to 174 , power is actually divided be tween a conservative coalition of about 180 Republicans and Southern Democrats and about 180 members who can be expected to go along with most Administration proposals . That leaves some 70-75 " uncommitted " members among whom the Administration must scratch and claw to put together a winning margin . In 1962 , collecting those uncommitted votes will be even more difficult than last year , since nearly all Congressmen report that during their adjournment-period visits back home they found great popular sup port for President Kennedy but little enthusiasm for his domestic programs . <P> The change in House leadership caused by the death of Speaker Sam Rayburn is another complicating factor . With Mister Sam gone , much of his power is bound to be claimed by the House committee chairmen , whose patriarchal views and parochial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith , chairman of the Rules Committee , is certain to stand in the way of Administration programs . Missouri 's Clarence Cannon , chairman of the Appropriations Committee , last week announced , even before he knew what was in Kennedy 's budget , that he intended to cut it . <P> Of all the chairmen , the one whose support Kennedy most vitally needs is Arkansas ' Wilbur Mills . It is Mills 's Ways &; Means Committee that must pass on at least three major items in the Administration 's legislative package : liberalized foreign trade , medical care for the aged , and interim tax revision . Although Mills personally favors freer foreign trade , he is under heavy pressure from protectionists back home , and the extent to which he will support the Administration is problematical . Mills goes along with tax revision , but is in flat opposition to President Kennedy 's medical-care plan . <P> The specific prospects for the 1962 legislative year :
