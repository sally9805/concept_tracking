txt Washington , April 24-President Kennedy said today in reply to critics of his Cuban policy that the alternative to administration efforts to deal with the communist Castro dictatorship is war and world-wide trouble . The President told a press conference he knows the American people are concerned because Fidel Castro is still in power in Cuba , but the administration has done about all it can " to demonstrate hostility " to a Russian base in the western hemisphere short of measures which would bring violence in their wake . Replies to G.O.P. Asked to comment on Republican criticism that the administration 's measures to deal with the Cuba problem are not as firm as they might be , the President replied : " Now , coming down to the question which is rather sidestepped  --  that is , if the United States should go to war in order to remove Castro  --  that nettle is not grasped , and it would seem to me that we have pretty much done all of those things that can be done to demonstrate hostility to the concept of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which bring in their wake violence and may bring a good deal of world-wide difficulty . Seen as Alternative " If they the Cuba policy critics are advocating that , then I recognize that as an alternate policy . But if it is merely a policy which says that we should do something without defining it  --  except perhaps .. . unleashing the exiles which can not do the job  --  it seems to me that we deserve in a question of this importance a good deal more precision in our prescriptions for its solution . " President Kennedy was questioned specifically at the press conference about the Cuban policy criticism made by Richard M. Nixon , former Republican Vice President and Kennedy 's opponent in the 1960 Presidential election . Charges Exiles Leashed Nixon said in a speech last Saturday at a newspaper editors ' meeting in Washington that the Kennedy administration has " leashed " militant , anti-Castro exile groups . Nixon urged removing restrictions from these exiles and encouraging them in their efforts to free Cuba . President Kennedy said today , in reference to Nixon 's criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted to assume control in the 1950s , and perhaps it would have been easier to take an action then than it is now . " But , the President commented , those who were in a position of responsibility in the United States when Castro came to power did not make that judgment . Took Over in 1959 Castro came to power on Jan. 1 , 1959 , during the Republican Eisenhower-Nixon administration . President Kennedy was asked about the charge made last week by Sen. Kenneth B. Keating R. , N. Y. that contrary to recent government reports , there has been no net reduction in the number of Russian military personnel stationed in Cuba since the Soviet Union pulled out its nuclear missiles and bombers late last year . The President recalled that three weeks ago he reported that an estimated 4,000 to 5,000 Russians had left Cuba since January . He said , however , that since the missiles and bombers were removed , there has been " no substantial reduction " in Russian miltary equipment in Cuba . Kennedy said his estimates of the numbers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still remain are based upon the best information available to United States intelligence agencies . He acknowledged that thousands of Russians are still in Cuba , but said there is no evidence of " any substantial introduction " of Russian military personnel into the island since last January to offset the withdrawals . Urges Exile Unity President Kennedy was asked at his news conference for comment on United States policy toward armed exile raids on Cuba now that the Castro government had released 21 American prisoners . The questioner stipulated that the raids he had in mind would not violate United States laws . The chief executive replied that he did not believe public discussion of exile raids at this time would serve a useful purpose or be " very beneficial to the exiles . " The President said in reSponse to another question that he felt there should be more unity am ong Cuban exile groups , but United States recognition of a Cuban government-in-exile is an entirely different matter .                    @
