Tribalism is a distasteful word to educated Africans . It suggests that atavistic fears play a disproportionate role in the politics of new African nations . Distasteful or not , tribalism is a key to many African problems-a point that was made all too emphatically in Kenya last week . President Jomo Kenyatta , who with his fellow Kikuyu has ruled the country since independence in 1963 , threw Opposition Leader Oginga Odinga in prison and banned his Luo-dominated party . <P> Kikuyu and Luo , first and second largest of Kenya 's 46 main tribes , have long controlled the country 's politics . Initially , neither Kenyatta 's Kenya African <P> National Union ( KANU ) nor Odinga 's Kenya People 's Union ( KPU ) were organized along strictly tribal lines . One of KANU 's brightest stars , for example , was Tom Mboya , the brilliant young Minister for Economic Planning-and a Luo . In recent years , however , both party memberships have become increasingly polarized . Mboya 's assassination last July widened the rift . A Kikuyu was found guilty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KANU leaders instigated the slaying . At Mboya 's funeral , Kenyatta 's car was stoned . Fearful of further Luo unrest , the Kikuyu resumed the Mau Mau-like oath-takings near Kenyatta 's home , thereby compounding Luo distrust . Then came the latest explosion . <P> Angry Warning . Kenyatta and a milelong KANU motorcade , fresh from rousing receptions in KANU territory , drove into Luo-dominated Kisumu in western Kenya . Almost immediately , signs of hostility were apparent . As a gesture of welcome , local officials had banana trees planted along the road . When Kenyatta drove past , however , cattle and goats set loose by Luo farmers were placidly munching the bananas . At a mass rally to dedicate a $3,500,000 Russian-built hospital , tension sharpened . As Odinga stood by , KPU hecklers shouted " Dume " ( pronounced du-may and meaning " bull " ) , the party 's slogan , and KANU backers retaliated . Turning on Odinga , Kenyatta shouted : " KPU is only engaged in dirty divisive words . Odinga is my friend , but he has been misled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this area . " Then he warned Odinga and his KPU followers : " We are going to crush you into flour . Anybody who toys with our progress will be crushed like locusts . Do not say later that I did not warn you publicly . " <P> As Kenyatta 's convoy began to move away after the speech , spectators stoned the lead car . Panicky police fired point-blank into the crowd , leaving at least nine dead and 70 wounded . Two days later , Kenya police arrested Odinga , and most of the other KPU leadership , including all eight of the party 's MPs . A day later , KPU was banned for allegedly seeking " to overthrow the lawful and constitutional government of the Republic of Kenya . " It seemed a clear reference to Communist intrigues . Though apparently no Communist , Odinga is a leftist who has accepted funds from Soviet and Chinese Communist agents ; " Double O " was also instrumental in persuading the Russians to build the new hospital in Kisumu.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
