txt A vastly enlarged program of Federal aid to rescue city transit systems from financial disaster was strongly recommended today by John J. Gilhooley , acting chairman of the New York City Transit Authority . An a fervent plea-to the houiing subcommittee of the House Banking and . Currency Committee , Mr. Gilhooley said . the %tittle. had come to think is terms , of " billions of dollars for capital expansion of our Miss transit systems . " He also gave the committee a proposal that ' lead to radical changes in the uses to which Federal funds were put by communities receiving them . Direct Capital Grants At present the Government makes direct grants for capital improvements , such as new track , new cars or new lines . Mr. Gilhooley suggested the money be used instead to pay the interest on state and local bonds sold to finance mass transit facilities . This , Mr. Gilhooley suggested ; could greatly increase the city 's leverage to raise funds for capital improvements . He told the committee that running an urban mass transit system  --  which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years ? is not like " running a railroad or bus line . " It is , he said , " at its base , . a problem of humanism in the metropolitan area . " And he made it clear that the humans who had to . ride New York 's subways were living in various states of misery . He said several lines  --  including one in Queens and the Lexington . Avenue line of the East Side , had become " intolerably overcrowded . " The subcommittee is holding hearings on an Administration proposal to increase research and capital grant funds for urban mass transit . $375-M1llion Appropriated Under the Mass Transit Act of 1964 , Congress appropriated $375-million to improve transit facilities over a three-year span . Mr. Gilhooley is generally acknowledged here to have been instrumental in creating support among transit officials and members of Congress for that bill . The proposal under consideration would extend the program to a fourth  --  year and add $95-million more . William B , Whin all , . Republican of New Jersey and a member of the subcommittee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure to provide Federal appropriations of $175-million for the fiscal year 1968 and for each fiscal year thereafter . Mr. Gilhooley applauded the Widnall proposal on the ground that it would place Federal aid for urban mass transit on an open-ended , or permanent , basis . But he said that even at a level of $175-million annually the program merely " scratched the surface " of the country 's needs . Representative Widnall agreed . The New York official estimated that the nation 's cities needed $12-billion for investment in plant and equipment to place their transit systems on a healthy basis . In New York alone , he said , $1.5-billion would be needed over the next 10 years to adapt the transit system to growing commuter demands and technological change . $81-Million Deficit Seen He told the subcommittee that the system faced a deficit of $81-million by the end of this year . He blamed several factors , including loss of revenue in the transit strike , unexpectedly high wage increases granted to transit workers and a change in travel habits that cost the system some passengers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his proposal that the Mass Transit Act be revised to permit use of Federal funds to pansion of transit improvements . He said that if the $375-million appropriated by Congress in 1964 , plus the $95-million requested for next year , had been applied for this purpose , cities would have been able to raise $2.5-billion in capital . Furthermore , he said , if the cities were willing to match the Federal Government 's contribution , almost $5-billion could have been raised  --  nearly half the $12-billion necessary to rehabilitate and enlarge every major transit system in the country . He acknowledged that the proposal was " unprecedented " in the mass transit field . " But why , " he asked , " should we not move forward in this way ? Every private corporation , and probably every state and local government , finances capital investment in this manner . Our Federal housing program is financed in this manservice the debt on state and ner . It Is a sound and logical local bonds sold to finance ex- procedure to pay for a capital investment over the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Gilhooley said that under the 1964 legislation , New York had received $26-million for new subway cars , social studies and pilot projects . He called this " a drop in the bucket " and urged removal of the 12.5 per cent limitation on the amount that any one state could receive from the funds appropriated by Congress .
