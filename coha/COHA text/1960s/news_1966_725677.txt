txt " Five . . . four ... three . . . two ... one . . . ignition . " It was the signal for one of the most . extraordinary chases mankind has ever known Racing around the world . Gemini 10 , piloted by two taciturn astronauts , Navy Comdr . John W. Young and Air Force Maj. Michael Collins , pursued an Agena target rocket for six hours and 103,000 miles , and caught it . They gave new meaning to an old phrase and hitched their wagon to a star . The " star " was the Agena , with a restart-able engine aboard . They ignited the engine and took a fiery ride higher than man has ever gone before , to 476 miles above the earth , eclipsing a 307.5-mile mark held by two Russian cosmonauts . " That was really something , " exclaimed // *Gemini 10 hitched to a ' star ' // Commander Young when the Agena rocket gave them a big boost into space . And Major Collins added , " When that baby lights up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysterious reason the process of " docking " the Gemini to the Agena used up an exorbitant amount of fuel . There was something like dismay in the control officer 's voice at Houston when he got a report on the reading . " You seem to have used up a tremendous amount of fuel . Did something different than ordinary happen ? " . . . a tough break ' " No , " replied Commander Young . " Just semed like a tough break , I think , but it did n't seem like it would use that much . Over . ... " The Young-Collins flight gave a boost to morale in a nation gloomy with war . It revealed the growing maneuverability of spacecraft , and of the spacemen who step out of their vehicles in orbit . As such it is another rung upward in the ladder in the climb to the moon , which President Kennedy said would cost $20 billion . But while maneuverability now seems proved , related problems of energy conservation seem to challenge the astronauts . The unexplained consumption of fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of proposed space tests . Radio not so noisy - Meanwhile the excited , jubilant mood that found expression in the space-to-land chitchat of earlier astronauts gave place to quiet efficiency that was almost uncommunicative . It brought comments even from ground crews . " This has been one of the most untalkative flights to date , " observed Paul Haney , voice of the Houston Mission Control , almost rue fully . " We can only recall hearing from Mike Collins on two or three occasions . " It seemed that space . travel might be leaving the " gee whizz " era , and entering the " ho-hum " era . That was n't true though at blast-off , particularly for a novice reporter who had never seen one of them before . A hawk circled lazily in the blue sky . Observers could see a great sweep of green running a mile and a half to where the Agena and the Gemini structures pointed upwards . Around the world tracking craft waited . " Three , two , one -- ignition , " boomed the voice . Off the pad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensely bright light burning to one side , searing as an acetylene torch . Then the noise . Birds flew wildly . It was a reverberating roar . Like thunder . But with a pulse in it a kind of enormous put , put-put . The big needle slowly rose into the air . In no time it was gone and all that was left was the excited voice of the announcer and a cloud of smoke drifting away . That was Agena , the target rabbit that the hound of heaven was to pursue , starting 100 minutes later . Then came Gemini 10 itself , with two men in the cone on their backs reclining to take the thrust . What do astronauts think about as they wait the blast off ? Nobody knows , but the final physical check showed conditions hardly above normal . " Five minutes , 20 seconds , and counting . Three minutes , 10 seconds , and counting . . " Titan 2 noisier This time the smoke was darker , the noise louder . The great vehicle moved upward in a leisurely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a skim-milk haze over it . Gemini 10 mounted , not seeming so much lifted by , as pulling after it a forked tail of flame behind its Titan 2 rocket . As it went through colder air a great cumulus cloud of condensation vapor rolled off . Then it was gone . Sky-watchers identify themselves with the astronauts and listen avidly for the comments that betray the human side . Messrs . Young and Collins did n't give them many , however . It was a flawless double-launch . Commander Young exclaimed , " Seco ( sustainer engine cutoff . Good seco . " Mission Control : " Roger ... looks good They 're of An Atlas-Agena leaps ahead of the Titan 2-Gemini 10 in this combined photo o , two successful launchings . They actually took place 100 minutes apart . Command pilot John W. Young and fellow Gemini astronaut Michael Collins later caught up with the Agena target vehicle and docked with it . from here . . . everything looks good from here . " " It looks beautiful , man , " responded the flier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Suggest we conclude the simulation and start the debriefing , " he said , implying that the mission was already complete . " Houston , " said Commander Young later , " we got two bright objects up here in our orbital path . I do n't think they 're stars . They look like we 're going right along with them . " Control : " Where are the objects from you ? If you can get up a bearing , maybe we can track them down . Young : " They just disappeared . I guess they were satellites of some kind . " Fiery objects of this sort are not uncommon . They are believed to be debris of some kind carried on the ascent .
