To eye and ear , the desultory discussion in the Senate seemed like anything but what it actually was : one of the most significant U.S. foreign policy debates in years . <P> Arkansas Democrat William Fulbright , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , stood casually with one hand in a pocket , spoke in an offhand manner : " Mr. President , it is my task today to commence the debate on the foreign assistance bill of 1963 . " Although long one of the Senate 's foremost advocates of foreign aid , Fulbright demonstrated that this time he really did find his task painful . " I tend to share the view of many members of this body , " he said , " that at least portions of the foreign aid program are obsolescent . " He urged the Kennedy Administration " not to delay embarking upon a full-scale re-examination of foreign aid requirements before the next session of Congress , which is approaching at alarming speed . " <P> Apologetic &; Symptomatic . Fulbright 's apologetic tone was symptomatic of the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the program , in its present form , is doomed . " The reason why the program is in trouble-and it is in trouble , " declared New York 's Republican Senator Jacob Javits , " is that neither this Administration nor the previous Administration understood what the private enterprise system is capable of contributing , and has failed to use it . " Oregon Democrat Wayne Morse charged that U.S. taxpayers were being " rooked by our worldwide-flung giveaway foreign aid program . " <P> The Senate is so sour on foreign aid that before the first week of debate was over Fulbright found that he could not even defend the $4.2 billion that his own committee had recommended in its authorization bill . He agreed with Majority Leader Mike Mansfield and G.O.P. Leader Everett Dirksen to cut it to about $3.8 billion . President Kennedy originally had sought $4.9 billion , dropped his request to $4.5 billion after a critical report by a special committee headed by General Lucius Clay . The House has approved only $3.5 billion . <P> Fulbright 's retreat was aimed at avoiding an even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has more than a dozen amendments to offer , needs about three weeks of debate to explain them all . Senator Everett Dirksen took exception to this , enlivened the debate briefly by ridiculing Morse . " With a decent approach and with no Senator feeling that all the wisdom reposes in him alone , we can get out of here on schedule , " said Dirksen . Otherwise , he predicted , Senators will sit around their Christmas tree Dec. 25 " in their red flannel pajamas , " watching their grandchildren , and suddenly remember that " we did n't finish foreign aid . " Morse led a move to try to send the whole bill back to the committee with instructions to completely reorganize the aid program ; the move failed , 46 to 29.
