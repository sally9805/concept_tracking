Civil rights demonstrators have frequently invoked an American tradition that is as old as the country itself : the First Amendment " right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances . " Harried police have often invoked something else : the power of every state to preserve the public peace and protect property rights . The conflict has faced the Supreme Court with a dilemma : When does state police power take precedence over the First Amendment 's protections for peaceful demonstrators ? <P> In case after case in past years , the court answered the question by throwing out convictions for demonstrations in public places . Yet the court could not blind itself to the ominous change in civil rights protest-from early nonviolence to last year 's holocaust in Watts . And a changing judicial attitude became apparent last February , when a bare majority of only five Justices reversed the convictions of Louisiana Negroes who had refused to leave a segregated public library . The sharpest dissenter was the court 's stoutest liberal , Justice Hugo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for people to be turned loose as long as whatever they do has something to do with race . That is not the way I read the Constitution . " <P> Evenhanded Enforcement . Last week it was Black who wrote the 5-to-4 majority opinion in a rare Supreme Court decision rebuffing civil rights demonstrators . Some 200 Negro students at Florida A. &; M. University in Tallahassee had marched to " the Leon County jail grounds in 1963 to protest the arrest of other students for picketing segregated movie theaters . Although the marchers merely sang songs , clapped hands and did not enter the jail , the sheriff ordered them to leave in ten minutes . When Harriett Adderley and 106 others refused to go , the sheriff arrested them under a state law that makes it a crime to " trespass upon the property of another " with " a malicious and mischievous intent . " <P> Before the Supreme Court , Appellant Adderley and 31 others cited such key precedents as Edwards v. South Carolina ( 1963 ) , which voided " breach of the peace " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banner outside the South Carolina statehouse . But in Edwards , countered Justice , Black , the Supreme Court merely ruled that the state law failed to regulate any specific conduct , such as statehouse visiting hours . <P> By contrast , said Black , the Florida law 's words , " malicious and mischievous , " narrowed its scope to one offense : willful trespass . Not only were the students guilty of just that , he said , but there was " not a shred of evidence " that the sheriff objected to their protest for any reason other than his legitimate concern for jail security . " Nothing in the Constitution of the United States , " said Black , " prevents Florida from evenhanded enforcement of its general trespass statute . . . The state , no less than a private owner of property , has power to preserve the property under its control for the use to which it is lawfully dedicated . "
