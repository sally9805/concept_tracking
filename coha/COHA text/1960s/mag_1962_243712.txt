The claim that his union was discriminating against its Negro and Puerto Rican members was too much for David Dubinsky , 70 , president of the International Ladies ' Garment Workers ' Union for the past three decades , and white-haired patriarch of New York 's Liberal Party . Before a House subcommittee investigating the charge of racism against the I.L.G.W.U. , Dubinsky admitted that proportionately few of the 100,000 Negro and Puerto Rican members of his 450,000-man union have become part of the hierarchy . He explained that they were still gaining necessary experience at lower levels . <P> Then Dubinsky struck out at the notion that anyone should be elected or appointed to responsible office simply because of being a minority member . Said he : " I 'll be damned if I will support the idea of the professional Negro , the professional Jew , the professional Italian , that a man should be a union officer because of his race , color or creed . He should be an officer on his merits , ability and character . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
