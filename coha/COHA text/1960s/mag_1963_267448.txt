The U.S. teacher used to be afraid to smoke , chew , cuss or ask for a raise . Now he denounces crowded classrooms , upbraids lawmakers , and goes on strike almost as readily as a dockworker . He even demands a say in things that school boards always considered their sole province . Teacher militancy is busting out all over . <P> The United Federation of Teachers , bargaining agent for New York City 's 43,000 teachers , is currently threatening to strike not only for more pay but also for various kinds of better schooling . The odds are 50-50 that New York 's 1,000,000 pupils are about to enjoy the longest summer vacation of their lives . The Utah Education Association , representing 98% of Utah public school teachers , threatened all summer to " withhold services " unless the state legislature boosted all school spending . Last week the teachers gave in , accepting a $700 raise that had been offered all along , but they left a memorable impression of long-sustained militancy . <P> A.F.T . v. N.E.A. What makes these two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that support them . New York 's unionized teachers belong to the 82,000-member American Federation of Teachers . Last year a one-day strike got them a pay raise , and a " victory " this year will make the A.F.T . look more and more like a powerhouse that gets results . Utah 's teachers belong to the 858,000-member National Education Association , biggest " professional " organization in the world . In response to teacher militancy , the N.E.A. has devised the " sanction " -a teachers ' boycott that supposedly is not a strike but can close schools . Utah was to be the big test : a national sanction against an entire state . <P> The A.F.T . is still a small , poor organization . Other unions boast lavish headquarters in Hoffa Hacienda style ; the A.F.T . makes do with an ancient brownstone in Chicago , where it was born 47 years ago . It gets only $650,000 a year in dues , and its paid staff totals 25 , including President Carl J. Megel , 63 , a mild if tough-talking former high school science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including 32 at college level , but only about 50 are nerved to act like labor unions and clinch collective bargaining agreements . <P> Union-Made . Nonetheless , the union has doubled its membership since Megel took over in 1952 . It does well in industrial areas , notably in the Midwest . It claims 50% of Detroit 's classroom teachers and 75% of Chicago 's , although neither city yet recognizes it as sole bargaining agent . It is strong in Milwaukee and Gary . But its prize is New York , the nation 's biggest school system , where it claims 20,000 teachers and speaks for all the others . To cheer on New York , the union will hold its national convention there next week and shout for collective bargaining .
