CREDOS AND CURIOS ( 180 pp. ) - James Thurber-Harper &; Row ( $3.95 ) . <P> The death of every major author , James Thurber wrote , is followed by the arrival at his door of a literary executor , who will drink his Scotch , mouse around his attic for a year or more , then cart off all his old laundry tickets , racing forms and telephone numbers for a posthumous volume . Anticipating this raggedy sort of immortality , Thurber once poked through his papers and . in The Notebooks of James Thurber , listed seven deterrents to their publication : " persistent illegibility , paucity of material , triviality of content , ambiguity of meaning , facetious approach , preponderance of juvenilia and exasperating abbreviation . " In this volume of hitherto uncollected sketches , essays and profiles , only the problems of illegibility and abbreviation have been solved . <P> The collection includes everything from introductions to cartoon books to patter for Playboy , 21 pieces in all , some more than 30 years old . The Notebooks is the best piece , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk , why the rest should not have been printed at all . Only Thurberphiles who want to have his " complete oeuvre " on their shelves will welcome the book , and oeuvre , after all , is a word that would have left Thurber annoyed and embarrassed .
