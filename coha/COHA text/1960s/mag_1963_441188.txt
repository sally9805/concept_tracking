PESIDENT Kennedy has said that this is the time of the year when newspapers ominously report that Congress has done almost nothing since it convened in January and is unlikely to accomplish much before it adjourns in the summer or fall . This year the start was particularly slow , especially in the Senate , but the President continues to predict success for his tax bill and for the bill to provide health care for the aged under Social Security . Both bills must go through the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee , and the latter will not consider either measure until it has been approved by the Ways and Means Committee and the House . This means that on a measure as complex and controversial as the tax bill the Finance Committee will wait on the sidelines fur perhaps the first half of the year . It rejected a proposal that it begin work before the bill passes the House . It refused to hold joint hearings with the Ways and Means Committee . Besides the intrinsic interest in these bills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizational and structural resistance the President faces in getting his program through Congress . Early in the session , recognizing that the Finance Committee was heavily weighted against the President and was the key Senate committee this year , some Administration leaders attempted to expand the committee 's size to make it more representative of the political complexion of the Senate . It should be emphasized that the political division and the size of congressional committees vary from session to session according to the strength of the two parties . An attempt is made to give Democrats and Republicans representation on committees approximately equal to the proportion of seats they hold in the total membership . There is always a great deal of skirmishing to give labor a favorable voice on the Labor Committee , business a predominant voice on Finance , conservatives a stronghold on Judiciary , and nonpartisanship the dominant voice on Foreign Relations . With 67 Democrats and 33 Republicans in the Senate , the Democrats should have a slightly better than two-to-one majority on committees . But this is not so on Finance . There the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make certain that the conservative domination continued . A proposal to put 14 Democrats and 7 Republicans on the committee died aborning in the Democratic Steering Committee , despite the efforts of Senate Democratic Leader Mike Mansfield . Senator Clark 's feud The refusal to bring the Finance Committee more in line with the division in the Senate was called inexcusable by Senator Joseph S. Clark of Pennsylvania , who has been engaged in a feud with what he calls " the Senate establishment , " as represented on the powerful Steering Committee : Clark said that the establishment stacks the committees to maintain the continued control of the Senate by the conservative coalition . He told the Senate , in one of his recent attacks on the establishment , that although a majority of Democratic senators were Kennedy supporters , this is " not a Kennedy Congress , and it seems to me that it is not going to be a Kennedy Congress . The principal reason why it is not going to be a Kennedy Congress , so far as the Senate is concerned , is , in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules , customs , manners , procedures , and traditions ? and because the operation under those obsolete and archaic setups is controlled by this oligarchical Senate establishment , a majority of members of which , by and large , are opposed to the program of the President . " Clark said that of the 15 members of the Democratic Steering Committee , which appoints the various Senate committees , 9 are conservatives ( 7 are from the South ) . Yet , he argued , 40 or 45 of the Senate 's Democrats support the President . When it came to passing out new committee assignments this year , Clark noted , 75 percent of the non-freshman senators who voted with the establishment against changing the filibuster rules got the assignments they requested , while only 7 percent of those who voted to change the rules got the assignments they requested . When the Steering Committee took up the question of the size of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee it decided to increase the number of Democratic seats , despite the protests of Chairman J. William Fulbright of Arkansas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to maintain the spirit of bipartisanship that has made the committee unique since the days of Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg . In the last Congress , the committee numbered 11 Democrats and 6 Republicans . Some Democrat 's and some Republicans wanted the ratio to be 14 to 7 , so that additional members supporting the bipartisan approach might be added from both parties . But the same Steering Committee that refused to increase the Democratic representation on the Finance Committee voted to increase it on the Foreign Relations Committee ? and to take a seat away from the Republicans . The Steering Committee voted for 12 Democratic seats and 5 Republican seats on Foreign Relations and gave the Democratic vacancy to Senator George A. Smothers of Florida . Republicans gave a vacant seat to Senator Karl E. Mundt of South Dakota . Neither Smothers nor Mundt can claim more than a parochial record on foreign policy . Their appointments to this important committee shocked a good many senators , as well as many close observers of the Washington scene . For almost a quarter of a century , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisted on a nonpartisan approach to foreign problems . In recent years , partisan and parochial considerations have influenced the choice of committee members . Earls party has mobilized its forces to keep off the committee highly qualified men like Senators Clark , Cooper of Kentucky , and Javits of New York . Instead , assignments have gone to men like former Senator Homer Capehart of Indiana , and Senators Williams of Delaware , Long of Louisiana , Lausche of Ohio , and Dodd of Connecticut . As the Senate is organized , so does it work . Clark warned that the whole Kennedy program is in danger because the Senate is under the control of the President 's opponents , chiefly the very shrewd , very able Southerners who run the Steering Committee , under the direction of Senator Richard B. Russell of Georgia . Clark pointed out that Woodrow Wilson would not have got his reform programs through Congress in 1913 and 1914 had he not been successful in putting his men in the key positions . President Wilson organized the committees in such a way as to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so . Wilson was able to organize the Senate because the Wilson Democrats cooperated with him to win control of the party machinery . They insisted on using the committees as the President 's instruments . In 1913 , the Democrats also resorted to the binding caucus in the House , and for a couple of years there was responsible party government . Today , with much larger Democratic majorities in Congress than there were in 1913 , it can hardly be said that a responsible party structure exists in either the House or Senate . Cuba and the Communist threat The partisan debate over Cuba , which began in the 1960 campaign and is almost certain to be an issue in the 1964 campaign , haunts the President , disturbs our allies , and causes deep concern in both parties . It is no defense of President Kennedy , who employed the Cuban issue to his own advantage in the 1960 campaign , to say that Fidel Castro will be a political threat to any Administration in Washington . Neither is it a defense of a do-nothing policy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be suffered as long as he is no more than a political threat . We know from last October 's experience what will be done when he is a military threat . And we know that as long as Cuba is a center for Communist propaganda and the training of saboteurs , vigorous countermeasures should be taken . But several observers feel we ought to recognize Castro 's limitations , and also America 's inability to do away with him , short of an overt attack . His police system is well organized and has the support of Russian experts . The chances are that Cuba will be a Communist country for a long time . A strong guard must always be kept against the possibility that Cuba may become a military threat again . At the same time , in the opinion of a number of experts in the Capital , we should recognize that the hemisphere may learn from the unhappy experience with Castroism . A Venezuelan newspaperman recently in Washington said that Communist failures in Cuba have given the hemisphere a decade more than it otherwise would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the unpopularity of Castro 's brand of Communism has been a major setback to the Communist movement in Latin America . President Kennedy 's trip to Costa Rica was undertaken primarily to express this country 's support for the Central American Common Market . According to Felipe Herrera , president of the Inter-American Development Bank , Latin-American countries can solve their economic problems only if they combine their resources in one or more common markets . He believes that unless Latin-American development is integrated , " it will inevitably find itself condemned to vegetative growth or hopeless stagnation . " Under the spur of Castroism the United States and most of the Latin-American countries are beginning to think much more realistically than heretofore in terms of joint defense , closer political cooperation , and integrated economic systems . Gilpatric leaves the Pentagon When President Kennedy Was putting his Cabinet together , he asked each prospective member to be prepared to remain in the government for four years . The result has been a remarkable degree of stability at the top . In over two years , the only Cabinet officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Report on Washington Health , Education , and Welfare , who resigned to run for the Senate in Connecticut , and Arthur J. Goldberg , Secretary of Labor , who left to accept appointment to the Supreme ? Court . There have been more changes in the sub-Cabinet group ; and Deputy Secretary of Defense Roswell L. Gilpatric is scheduled to return to his law practice shortly . While Secretary McNamara has received more attention than any other Cabinet officer ( except possibly the Attorney General ) and has seemed to run his department almost single-handedly , he has had unusually strong and able men to help him . None has been more important than Gilpatric , who knew the department and the ways of government well from previous experience and proved himself an even-tempered and able administrator under McNamara . Gilpatric 's resignation emphasizes once more the curiously wasteful aspects of a system that makes it necessary for a man with his talent for government to feel that he can serve only from time to time . Mood of the Capital After the harshest winter since 1936 , Washington is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glorious season everywhere , but nowhere more than here . The cherry blossoms , which are by no means overrated in the Board of Trade literature , are only a part of the Washington spring . Azaleas , tulips , hyacinth , and dogwood abound to make one forget the winter snows and the political doldrums that settled down over the Capital shortly after the 88th Congress convened . Perhaps it was partly the weather , but other events also combined to make the winter a bad one for the Kennedy Administration . De Gaulle , Cuba , the tax-bill arguments , the wrangle over " managed news , " the confusion over the proposed multilateral nuclear force , and the breakdown of the Geneva negotiations on a test-ban treaty undermined confidence in the Administration 's ability to deal effectively with the problems it faces . It will take more than spring to dispel these doubts . EVE years ago , the European Common Market opened shop in Brussels on a street auspiciously called l'Avenue de la Joyeuse Entree . The name seemed to befit an enterprise intended by its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Europe . But since last January , when the door was slammed on Britain , local wits in Brussels have been suggesting that the time has come to rename the less than auspicious street l'Avenue de la Triste Sortie . Since the fateful January 29 which put an abrupt end to negotiations that had been going on for almost a year and a half , harsh words and dire forebodings have been uttered . Addressing a European rally at the Hague on February 22 , Dr. Sicco Mansholt , a forthright Dutchman who is vice president of the Common Market 's nine-man Executive Commission and who was the man most deeply involved in the agricultural negotiations with Britain , labeled General de Gaulle and his supporters " authoritarian gravediggers . " Four days later the Belgian Foreign Minister , Paul-Henri Spaak , in a long speech to the Belgian Senate , likened De Gaulle to a " left-wing Socialist called Mussolini who was converted to a virulent nationalism . " What particularly irked Spaak and aroused his alarm , as it did that of the Dutch and the Italians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Common Market but the simultaneous conclusion of an exclusive Franco-German treaty which , if it was nut redundant in view of West Germany 's existing ties with its Common Market and NATO partners , could only be regarded as a potential threat to the future life of the Community . The Paris-Bonn treaty was prepared in such extraordinary secrecy that Spaak , like his other Common Market colleagues , was informed of its exact provisions only three hours before they were communicated to the press . Britain 's admission to the Common Market , followed , as it would have been , by the entry of Norway , Sweden , Denmark , Switzerland , and Austria , would unquestionably have transformed the character of the European Economic Community and imposed immense new problems on an already hard-worked staff of some 2500 technicians who have found it difficult to coordinate the complex industrial and legal regulations of six highly different states . Decisions which in the past have necessitated as much as two years of painstaking and detailed negotiation would in the future have taken three or four , and the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid out in detail in the Rome Treaty of March , 1957 , would have had to be so thoroughly revamped that it . would in effect have meant rewriting the original treaty . English would have taken its place alongside French as another , and perhaps even more important , working language . Such a prospect held no particular appeal for Spaak , who has never bothered to master the Flemish spoken by more than half of his countrymen . But Spaak knew , from the time he began championing England 's candidacy a year or more ago , that Britain 's admission to the Common Market would bring long-range advantages far outweighing the initial inconveniences and disturbances in the Community 's life . It would at one stroke have made Western Europe ? a Europe of 300 million producers and consumers ? not only the largest trading unit in the world ( which the Common Market already is ) but the largest producer and exporter of manufactured goods and the largest importer of agricultural products . It would also have given the weaker Common Market members , Benelux and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France , which in the present context means De Gaulle . Spaak versus De Gaulle Spaak 's private war with De Gaulle is anything but new . The two men have known each other for the past twenty years , ever since the misfortunes of war brought them together as exiles in in early March , the Belgian Senate voted with near unanimity ( I 1 I votes and 13 abstentions ) to keep the Belgian government from engaging in negotiations on the multinational Polaris submarine force without prior consultation with the Senate . The vote was intended to tie Spaak 's hands , in case he might succumb to the temptations of the Polaris offer ; it also revealed a deep-rooted skepticism about the feasibility of trying to form polyglot warship crews in a country where two linguistic communities periodically come to blows in a far less congested space . Linguistic chauvinism It might seem an anomaly that in an age of supersonic jets , shortwave radios , and atom bombs language disputes can still generate as much heat as they recently have in Belgium . Last October there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which necessitated the mobilization of 4000 policemen . In Flemish-speaking Antwerp , there were riots around a church where sermons continued to be delivered in French . And as recently as March , French-speaking and Flemish-speaking students at the Catholic University of Louvain clashed violently over the further splitting of the university into separate linguistic entities . Critics may regard these manifestations of linguistic chauvinism as parochial , but they reflect a sociological phenomenon which has erupted with varying intensity in Switzerland , Canada , Spain , the Italian Tyrol , and South Africa . The conflict , in the case of Belgium , goes back to the relatively recent origin of the country . In 1830 the kingdom of Belgium was formed from the southern provinces of the Netherlands to keep them from being annexed by France . Partly because Belgium came into being as a result of a revolt of the French-speaking people against the Dutch , partly because of the superior cultural attraction of the land and language of Victor Hugo , Dumas , and Balzac , French was the dominant language for the first hundred years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a second language in The Flemish part of Belgium ? the area north of Brussels , embracing Ghent and Antwerp to the west and Limburg to the east ? has been growing progressively richer , while Wallonia , to the south , has been stagnating . Although coal mines of the Borinage and around the industrial city of Charleroi , near the French border , have slowly been closing down , newer and more productive mines have been opened in the Limburg area , near Holland . The economy picks up The program of modernization , undertaken with the active encouragement of the European Economic Community , has begun to reap dividends , with the result that Belgium , which three years ago was beset by unemployment , is now plagued by a shortage of labor . Much of this favorable change can be explained by the growing success of the Common Market . As the country with the highest per capita rate of exports in the world ( in 1961 , $412 for Belgium , compared with $204 for Britain and $112 for the United States ) , Belgium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intramarket trade has been a mighty stimulant , increasing by 15 percent in 1961 and 13 percent last year . While this new wave of prosperity has taken a certain amount of the steam out of the linguistic conflict , the Walloons continue to live in fear of being discriminated against by an ever richer and more powerful Flemish majority . Two years ago , when unemployment in Wallonia was rife , these apprehensions erupted into the creation of a dissident Socialist splinter group called the Mouvement Populaire Wallon . Its founder was a dynamic union worker named Andre Renard , who was largely responsible for dragging Belgian labor into a series of turbulent strikes which looked as though they might degenerate into anarchy . But since Renard 's death last July , the Mouvement Populaire Wallon has lost some of its secessionist drive , and its leaders insist today that it is only a pressure group which has no intention , for the time being , at any rate , of becoming a political party . For the moment , Belgium is ruled by the some uneasy coalition between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elections of March , 1961 , when the country was faced with wide discontent at home and chaos in the Congo . The coalition is formed by the Social Christians , the former Catholic Party , led by Prime Minister Theo Lefevre , and the Socialists , who have usually been anticlerical and agnostic , led by Paul-Henri Spaak . So long as conditions both within and outside the Common Market go on favoring Belgium 's present prosperity , the government is likely to flourish . A new start in the Congo Spaak himself remains the country 's foremost political figure . Even his opponents give him most of the credit for restoring Belgium 's prestige in the Congo by steadfastly pursuing a policy of backing Cyril Adoula and , in general , the policies of UN Secretary U Thant . The success of this policy was illustrated by Premier Adoula 's official visit to Brussels in March , a visit which Spaak has been invited to reciprocate by visiting the Congo in June . While Spaak 's own Socialist past undoubtedly made it easier for him to reach an understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his labor training in Belgium , most of Spaak 's success has been due to his ability to persuade his countrymen to bury past grudges and start out anew in the Congo . One of his first acts on taking office in 1961 was to recruit new people who had no previous ties with the Congo and who could be more objective and impartial in their judgments of a highly emotional issue . With the towering figure of Charles de Gaulle , Spaak has a more formidable problem to tackle . No one knows it better than Spaak , who has made no secret of his forebodings . So far , however , he has found no remedy for the situation , save to do his best to keep the Common Market from grinding to a complete halt through the covert sabotage of its increasingly irritated members . For the worst thing that could happen would be to prove that De Gaulle was right when he said that Western Europe was not ready for integration . EVERYTHING in Venezuela right now stands under the sign of the presidential and congressional elections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other Latin-American countries , Venezuela is much more highly politicized than the Anglo-Saxon or Continental European nations . This is not so much the product of the Latin temperament ? Venezuela 's nearly 8 million people have a substantial amount of Negro blood among them ? as of the fact that governments in Latin America are relatively much more powerful than they are in the United States and Europe . Therefore , the business of government is more important to the people , and the prizes of politics are larger than they are in developed countries . Of course , there is a possibility that the elections will not be held at all . The Communist-dominated FALN terrorist organization , whose members stole painthis in Caracas and pirated the Venezuelan ship Anuategui , is doing its best to create such chaos that voting will become impossible . The members of the FALN raid government offices daily , rob and assault private citizens , leave scare bombs in hotels , and harass the countryside . While there can be no question about the cold cynicism with which the Communists direct the FALN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young men in it are genuine , if misguided , idealists , and some of them , operating in the Andean regions of Venezuela , have gained the reputation of being Robin Hoods . The young idealists of the FALN feel that their terrorism serves to highlight the stark contrast between rich and poor in Venezuela and that it expresses the discontent of the urban and rural masses with the squalor of their existence . The na ? ve members of the FALN think that problems of economics , politics , and social organization can be resolved overnight if the right principles and the right people prevail . The extremists of the left and the right The Communist manipulators of the FALN naturally have quite different aims in mind as they use the arms and funds that they receive via Cuba and as they exploit the idealists . It is not unlikely that they hope to provoke an army coup , staged with the avowed purpose of restoring law and order . An army coup would serve Communist purposes well . Either the military men who made it would turn out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular resistance than the FALN is able to organize , or the military men , in order to stay in power , would swing the country very sharply and quickly to the far left . Either outcome of a coup would help the Communists take over at a later stage . As usual , the Communists have the sympathy of the far right insofar as their opposition to the constitutional Betancourt government is concerned . The extreme conservatives in Venezuela are not numerous . Indeed , one very shrewd American political observer has said that he found the Venezuelan business community as a whole more progressive than many contributors to the Democratic Party in the United States . The far right in Venezuela can not forgive President Betancourt the fact that he was a Marxist long ago and can not bring itself to believe that he has broken with Communism . The thesis of the far right is that Betancourt wants to attain complete state socialism but that he chooses to pursue his goal by more gradual means than the Communists would like ; and the rightists are fond of quoting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader of the MIR ( Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria ) , which split off from Betancourt 's AD ( AcciOn Democratica ) , " We want the same thing that you do . " Rightists can not appreciate the political-tactical context of Betancourt 's statement , when he was desperately trying to avoid the left-wing MIR break from the AD , nor can they appreciate the pressures that Betancourt is under to bring progress to the Venezuelan people , Rightists , like the Communists , would like an army coup ; but the far right does not understand that an army coup would be much more damaging to conservative interests than to Communist ones , If elections are held as scheduled , this achievement of constitutionalism and orderly succession will be important to Venezuela . The country is sufficiently disorganized that such normal succession will not necessarily bind it , but the precedent will be useful in establishing the idea that a governmental transition ought to be made democratically and peaceably . There will probably be three candidates , one from the coalition of the AcciOn Democrfitica and the Social Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which consists of a non-Communist group that split off from AD and the URD ( Union Republicana Democratica ) , a polyglot outfit of independents ; and a third from the Communist-front MIR . The independents organize A very interesting new factor on the Venezuelan political scene is the recently created AsociaciOn Venezolana Independiente . AVI is composed of the Venezuelan well-to-do , from the self-made Eugenio Mendoza , the richest man in Venezuela , on down through many businessmen of lesser wealth but greater family tradition . AVI is not a political party but hopes to influence the elections in several ways . It would like to impose its candidate on the AD-COPEI coalition or , failing that , at least persuade the coalition to put up a man acceptable to AVI . AVI is also talking with the democratic opposition parties to get them to nominate a candidate to its liking . Under the best of circumstances , AVI would like to be able to say to the Venezuelan public , in effect : " Thanks to our pressure , you have two good democratic candidates to choose from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't vote for the Communists . " But in all probability , AVI will have to decide whether to go along with the government coalition or with the opposition . The extent to which AVI will have real influence remains to be measured . There is at the present very little money in the AVI treasury , and without money to con- tribute to the political parties , AVI is not going to be very effective . Just as important as money will be the size of the following that AVI can attract . AVI is trying to mobilize the independent vote by a series of meetings throughout Venezuela . If AVI can rally votes , that will give it much more leverage with the political parties than the social status of its members does . When they let their hair down with AVI members , the working politicians of Venezuela always come back to the same question : " How many votes can you people produce ? That is all we are interested in . " The nation builders As important as the end-of-theyear elections are , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in every underdeveloped country , are the jobs of improving the lot of the people and of nation building . Perhaps the most interesting and exciting development is IVAC ( Instituto Venezolano de AcciOn Comunitaria ) . IVAC is a development foundation , conceived by the Venezuelan business community and handsomely financed by both foreign and stational private enterprise . Before 1963 is out , IVAC will have trained some 1500 village leaders , both men and women , in seven-week courses where they learn handicrafts , public speaking , and civic organization . The graduates of the IVAC courses return to their villages and organize the people for do-it-yourself projects in the construction of housing , aqueducts , roads , schools , and community centers . More important , the IVAC trainees give their fellow villagers a sense of civic consciousness and civic pride , so that they all feel that democratic self-help and self-determination are the way to progress , rather than extremist solutions . IVAC 's village leaders are not left solely to their own devices . In each state capital there exists a volunteer team of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like . Once a village has made its improvement plans , it can call on the specialist team for expert technical assistance . This process brings not only material benefits to the villages , but it also closes the social gap between country and city and between rich and poor . As time goes on , IVAC should become one of the most significant factors which contribute to domestic tranquillity in Venezuela . IVAC is but one example of the increasing enlightenment and progressiveness of Venezuela 's business leaders . Early this year , a hundred Venezuelan executives and foreign businessmen with interests in Venezuela met for four days in Maracay to discuss the expansion of private and corporate philanthropy . The habit of giving for civic purposes is not nearly so well developed in Venezuela and the other Latin-American countries as it is in the United States . From the Maracay meeting and subsequent discussions there is expected to emerge an understanding among Venezuelan businessmen that , say , one percent of their corporate profits will henceforth be regularly earmarked for things like IVAC , private education , and public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowing into education at all levels , from the elementary schools of the Fe y Alegria ( Faith and Happiness ) organization to the Catholic University Andres Bello in Caracas . This private education is essential because the public school system is so heavily Marxist-infiltrated . A decade or so ago , the Communists captured the nation 's principal teacher-training institute , and as a result thousands of schoolteachers dispense Marxism with the three R 's . The Betancourt government has made a valiant effort to reduce the infiltration of the school system , but this is not the sort of thing that can be corrected overnight . Meanwhile , the private educational system serves to protect the young from insidious indoctrination . Students in turmoil The blackest spot on Venezuela 's educational record is the Central University in Caracas , at which more than 15,000 students are enrolled . An aggressive Communist minority , both on the faculty and in the student body , keeps the university in constant political turmoil . The Communist students have arms in their dormitories , and when the mood strikes them they fire into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communists stage such wild demonstrations that classes have to be suspended for weeks at a time . Furthermore , student agitators refuse to do assigned reading and insist that examination questions must cover only what is contained in the classroom lectures . These various unsavory practices keep the intellectual level of the university down to the point where disciplined Marxist teaching provides the only body of coherent doctrine that many students ever experience . But even the Marxism at Central University is third-rate , since there is not one really competent Communist intellectual teaching there . The university enjoys autonomy , which is to say that its grounds are off limits for the police and the military . However , the Betancourt government is taking cautious steps to abridge an autonomy that is both destructive for the university and for the peace of Caracas . The non-Communist students and teachers are also becoming impatient with the constant disruption of academic life . Despite all the political turbulence , Venezuela is making progress . In the countryside , a constructive agrarian reform program is creating thousands of new landed proprietors . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than on political expediency , and the program is sufficiently well financed so that the new landowners receive the tools , seed , stock , and operating credit that they need . In the cities , industrialization is proceeding apace , and the town of Valencia is booming with new plants and investments . Oil , the greatest source of Venezuela 's wealth , continues to flow in abundance and to finance the bulk of the government 's programs , and a new iron and steel industry is springing up . An orderly political transition through elections will do a lot to consolidate the progress that Venezuela has shown and to provide the framework for more progress in the years ahead . WAT happens at Aswan during this decade seems likely to make or break Egypt 's revolution . The High Dam four miles south of Aswan is the focus of all economic planning . On its success depend all the schemes for reclamation and extended irrigation and for industrialization . These future projects involve moving millions of Egyptians to new places where they can make a living . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 28 million Egyptians to feed . There are already some five million unemployable people in rural Egypt . With 800,000 births each year , Egypt 's demographic problem is overwhelming . TWO approaches to a solution are being tried . One is the expansion of acreage which can be made productive . The other is a vertical expansion of production by means of increasing output per acre . The High Dam will help both these efforts and will make industrialization possible . Progress on the High Dam is now measurable . Working on a round-the-clock schedule , some 20,000 people are involved in its creation , Of these , about 800 are Russian engineers holding supervisory jobs . Several hundred Egyptian engineers work with them . The minister for the High Dam , Sidky Suliman , is Egyptian . In addition , a number of Egyptian army engineers are assigned to work at Aswan . Finally , Egyptian and Nubian laborers make up the crews blasting by day and hauling away by night the mountains of solid granite which must be moved to create a 300-foot-deep diversion channel for the Nile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of the High Dam is estimated at one billion dollars , nearly one third of which is being lent by the U.S.S.R. for equipment and personnel . The rest must come from Egyptian resources . Final authority rests with the Egyptian Ministry for the High Dam . A turning point in construction was celebrated in January , when the first stone blocks were placed in the river to start one of two coffer dams which are scheduled to control the Nile 's flow into the diversion tunnel by June , 1964 . At the present rate of effort , the target date can be met . To ensure success , extra British and Swedish equipment has been added to that from Russia for some of the heaviest rock moving . Once the river is diverted , work can begin on the High Dam structure . Opinions differ as to how long its construction will take . There are responsible estimates that it will be completed by 1970 , and the remaining hydroelectric installations by 1973 . Meanwhile , new reclamation areas and industries have been started with the water and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the experimental Liberation Province has already reclaimed 25,000 acres for fruit growing and agricultural industries . When the High Dam is completed , it is expected that some 800,000 acres can be brought into cultivation there . A second venture is under way in the so-called New Valley in the Western Desert . At the site of ancient desert oases , artesian wells have been established with sufficient promise of sustained flow from underground sources to encourage great hopes . But pumping on an extended scale awaits the availability of hydroelectric power from the High Dam . Consequently , the plans for resettlement of several million peasants in the New Valley hinge on developments at Aswan . Symbol of industrialization The beginnings of a complex of industries around Aswan have already been made . Iron ore from this region is being shipped to Helwan , near Cairo , where Egypt 's first steel mill is in operation . Plans for further utilization of Aswan ores are under discussion with American companies . The Kima fertilizer plant , completed at Aswan in 1960 by West German technicians , is producing 1600 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power from a hydroelectric plant built at the existing Aswan Dam by Swedish and Swiss engineers . It has already doubled the electric power production of Egypt . The High Dam , however , will give Egypt five times more power at a fraction of its present cost . These basic facts explain the anxiety over the clam throughout Egypt . When officials speak of it , they do so in terms of imperatives . It must and will be built . Moreover , there is a modern mystique about the dam . It is the foundation for a new way of life . It symbolizes the country 's rise to a position of strength in the modern world . Its scale is greater than that of the pyramids and its purpose more lofty , in the opinion of today 's Egyptians . While Russian participation is openly acknowledged , it is not emphasized in propaganda about the dam . Egypt 's responsibility is stressed , and its determination to see the project through . When President Nasser spent a week at Aswan in January , it was to celebrate Egyptian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russians received credit . But it was the Egyptian laborers who were featured , and all workers in Aswan Governorate were given a 10 percent bonus to celebrate their visible progress . Boom in Aswan Normally , Aswan is a quiet town , where the Nile flows silently around Kitchener 's Elephantine Island and the smaller islets of the cataract region . The tomb of the late Aga Khan overlooks this tranquil scene from its site on the hills east of Aswan . To Ismaili followers of the Aga Khan , Aswan is a holy place . Historically it was a way station for caravans en route from the north to Mecca and Medina . It remains the site of many Fatimid tombs dating from the eighth to the twelfth century . Aside from its historical interest to tourists , Aswan has an ideal winter climate . Generations of health seekers have repaired to its Kiplingesque Cataract Hotel in retreat from Europe 's cold winters . Today another , sort of visitor is discovering Aswan . He is the European or Asian businessman seeking contracts in anticipation of an industrial boom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streamlined , now invites these newcomers , who help to give the town a surprisingly cosmopolitan air . It is surprising because at Alexandria foreigners are being pushed out in a drive for Egyptianization of business . Oddly enough , at Aswan Europeans are being urged at the same time to invest in Egypt 's tourist business , in its projected local steel industry , and in the numerous services suddenly in demand in Upper Egypt . There is , of course , a great influx of Egyptians , attracted by new job openings . Aswan 's population has grown from 28,000 to 53,000 its ten years . Housing for workers at the clam site and at the Kima plant set a new standard . Playing fields , swimming pools , schools , and health centers are multiplying . The new air-conditioned flats are rented at subsidized prices to employees . A local technical institute is planned to train young Egyptians for local technical jobs . Such decentralization is designed to shift the pattern of urbanization and attract competent professionals to Aswan . Relocating the Nubians There is little local concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will have to move out of the way of the impounded Nile waters sometime next year . These people , descendants of the first Nile settlers centuries ago , are being moved to thirty-three new villages under construction near Kom Ombo , the sugarcane country north of Aswan . The plan is to persuade the Nubians to become sugar cultivators by giving them land and housing . Like many plans conceived in the name of progress , this one is not altogether well received by those it is designed to benefit . It has been against the tradition of the Nubians to mix with the Saidis of Upper Egypt . They have lived separate , proud , poverty-stricken lives in their rocky hovels along the upper Nile . Heads of families have been in the habit of going to Cairo for work and sending money to their families back home . It is a question of whether they can be induced to take up new lives on the land , even on better land . The fate of the threatened antiquities in Upper Egypt is simpler to decide . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settings . Philae , which stands between the present Aswan Dam and the High Dam , will re-emerge in all its beauty when it is protected by a small dam promised at U.S. expense . Abu Simbel , site of two rock temples , will be submerged , to the distress of many . Meanwhile , the new international atmosphere of Upper Egypt extends all along the Nile to the Sudanese border , as archaeologists from a dozen countries work against time . Some are on contract with the Egyptian government ; some arc on educational grants from scholarly institutions . Their task is to dig up everything of archaeological importance before the flooding of Nubia begins in 1964 , As the water behind the High Dam rises , it will eventually create a lake 365 miles long , extending over all of Egyptian Nubia and into the Sudan . This means the submerging of what was historically a buffer region between Egypt and the rest of Africa . The Sudanese Nubians face loss of identity and homes with even more resistance than their cousins in Egypt . Some 50,000 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Egypt 's expense . Their temples and religious paintings , many of which are Christian , are being moved to safety at Khartoum . Egypt between East and West With work on the High Dam project obviously progressing , the question arises of what the Soviets are gaining by their vital contribution to it . To the extent that it becomes a symbol for many poor countries in Africa and Asia , the Russians will surely receive reflected glory . So far , however , there has been little direct political benefit to the Russians . Paradoxically , the Communist world would seem more likely to benefit from failure at Aswan . For then Egypt would face starvation and anarchy and become vulnerable to complete takeover . President Nasser 's regime , meanwhile , has taken pains to mend relations with the West . It has paid ahead of time the $81,200,000 agreed on between it and World Bank President Eugene Black in 1957 , as due the stockholders of the former Suez Canal Company . This payment has cleared the atmosphere between Britain and France and Egypt . Trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Algerian settlement , Egypt has made trading approaches to some of the Brazzaville countries , apparently ignoring its political involvement with the strongly nationalistie Casablanca powers . In Europe itself , Egypt is seeking some sort of consortium aid to help finance its industrial expansion . ' There are indications that French banks will join British , Italian , and West German interests in this proposed form of aid . In this way Egypt hopes to balance its dependence on the Eastern bloc and to ensure its European cotton market . United States aid to Egypt continues to be in tangibles . A three-year credit of $160 million to be paid in Egyptian pounds permits Egypt to count on American surplus wheat for this period . Credits for specific economic enterprises using American equipment continue to be available . But the United States is not paying for Egypt 's part in the war in Yemen . The costs of that effort have to be paid out of Egypt 's cotton income and by the Egyptian taxpayer .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
