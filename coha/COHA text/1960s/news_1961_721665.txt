txt President Kennedy submitted to Congress today a wide-ranging economic program . He asked legislation and an , pounced administrative action to help the unemployed and the aged , to spur recovery and rto stimulate ? economic growth at a rate somewhat in excess olt 3% per cent a year . The message did not estimate the program 's cost , but ( ) fa , cials said it would be less than $5,000,000,000 . Mr. Kennedy included in his message , the news that unern ; p/oyment rose again in Jan= uary , although less than usual for that time of year . ? " Our ' nation has been falling further and further short of it 's economic capabilities , " Mr. Kennedy said . " We can not expect to make good in a day or even a year the accumulated deficiencies of several years . " It requires , he said " a program that goes well beyond anti-recession measures . " Major Points in Message These were the major points in the message : cThe President asIked Congress to raise the minimum monthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit men to cdilect benefits beginning at age 62 . The program would be financed by adding one-fourth of 1 per cent to the tax on both employers and workers . The increase would go into effect Jan. 1 , 1963 , along with the rise of one-half of 1 per cent already scheduled for that date . %le said he expected to propose " modification " of business taxes to stimulate investment in plant and equipment . He would offset this revenue loss by removing " several unwarranted special tax benefits " and improving tax collection and enforcement . ? qHe predicted declining longterm interest rates , whin should stimulate the flow of credit for the expansion of industrial plant and public projects , " as a result ' of measures already wider way . " This was interpreted as a reference to , among other things , new departures in Treasury and Federal Reserve praeticei. e .. He proposed temporary unemployment insurance extension for the long-term jobless . This ? would be financed by raising the wage base on which erri players pay the unemployment insurance tax from $3,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvements up to 1$1.25 an hour that are roughly comparable to what the Senate ; Labor subcommittee  --  John F. ' Kennedy , chairman  --  proposed last suMme ? . %le announced establishment of a President 's Advisory Committee on Labor-Management Policy to advise him " with respect to actions that may be taken by labor , management and the public " on wages , prices , collective bargaining , automation and other matters of business economics . It will have labor , management and public members and a Cabinet secretary as chairman . The President reported that unemployment rose again in January , to 5,400,000 . That was the highest of any January , and nearly the highest of any month since the onset of World War IL But the increase from December-850,000 ? was less than usual for this time of year , so the adjusted rate of unemployment dropped to 6.6 per cent from 6.8 per cent . The improvement in the rate of unemployment was characterized by an Administration official as " statistically insignificant . " Its significance might be that the rate did not worsen ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unemployment total , however , long-term unemployment continued to mount . Two . Other Reports Two other reports today on activity in December were negative . Total business inventories were reduced further during the month  --  by $450,000,000 , seasonally adjusted  --  to a yearend total of $91,000,000 , the Commerce Department reported . And the Federal Reserve Board reported that the increase in consumer installment credit outstanding was the smallest of the year . It was $76,000,000 , seasonally adjusted , making a year-end total of $43,382,000,000 . Assuming an upturn this year , as economists generally do , - " the problem of unused potential will remain , " the President said . Even if output reaches the $515,000,000,000 level predicted by the Eisenhower Administration , he said , the gap between what the nation actually produces aid what it could produce would continue to grow and unemployment would " hover between 6 and 7 per cent throughout the Tear . " The gap between actual and potential was $30,000,000,000 plus last year , he said , con-tinuing : " In 1960 , the American economy produced $503,000,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $535,000 , - 000,000 * * * . This could have been accomplished with readily available manpower , materials and machines  --  without straining productive capacity and without igniting inflation . " Problems of Inflation The President took note of the problems of inflation at several points in his message . His proposal for a higher minimum wage made a specific disclaimer of its inflationary potential . " Experience with previous minimum wage increases indicates little effect on prices , " he said . And in the final section of the report he made a broad statement of his views on this score . This country will not " seek to buy short-run economic gains by paying the price of excessive increases in the cost of living , " he said . " Always a cruel tax upon the weak , inflation is now the certain road to a balances-of-payments crisis and the disruption of the international economy of the western world , " he said . If it should threaten in the year ahead , he went on , " we shall use ' the powerful tools of fiscal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized the possibility that business could get worse this year instead of better . He said that if the measures he proposed today " prove to be inadequate to the task " of recovery and growth , " I shall submit further proposals within the next seventy-five days . " There will be many messages , already planned , before then . Economic Growth Rate Mr. Kennedy 's statement of an economic growth rate objective was distinctly more temperate than the Democratic platform 's declaration : " We Democrats believe that our economy can and must grow an average rate of 5 per dent annually . " The President put it in terms of improving on the normal potential . Current patterns  --  a 11/2 per cent increase in the work force each year and a .2 per cent increase in output a man ( productivity ) ? " provide the base , for a potential annual growth of 31/2 per cent , " he said . " This is not enough , " he said , toting also that the actual rate in recent years has not been that high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He recommended twelve " measures for economic recovery " and four for " promotion of economic growth and price stability . " Roughly one-half require Congressional action , and one-half can be done by the Administration with its existing authority . A number had been disclosed at yesterday 's Presidential press conference and in other official statements and unofficial reports . Tne President 's message was Compiled and prepared by his Council of Economic Advisers and by others in his official family . The advisers are Walter W. Heiler , chairman ; James Tobin and Kermit Gordon . Details included the following : MONETARY POLICY AND DEBT MANAGEMENT The President said that the managers of money ( the Federal Reserve ) and the national debt ( the Treasury ) face " two apparently contradictory objectives . " One is to keep shortterm interest rates high enough to prevent a further outflow of investment funds that would add to balance-of-payments difficulties . The other is to bring e ? lon-term rates down to spur the domestic economy . " These two can be achieved concurrently , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT He repeated yesterday 's announcements easing credit , and disclosed a few more details . He said that " a reduction of mortgage interest rates is already overdue " and that " officers of many leading lending institutions share , my view * * * and are prepared to cooperate . " UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE He proposed a temporary program of added weekly benefits for jobless workers who have exhausted their regular benefits since Oct. 31 . The Treasury would advance funds to the states . It would be repaid out of higher taxes , effective Jan. 1 . The unemployment insurance tax is paid by employers on the first $3,000 of an insured worker 's earnings . The base would be raised to $4,800 . NEEDY CHILDREN The aid to dependent children program now provides assistance for needy children if their fathers are deceased , disabled or family deserters . " In logic , and humanity , " Mr. Kennedy said , " a child should also be leligible if his father is a needy unemployed worker , " and he proposed temporary aid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five pilot food stamp projects was expanded to six . They will be conducted in West Virginia , Pennsylvania , eastern Kentucky , northern Minnesota , southern Illinois and the Detroit area . VETERANS The President held , out the possibility of an " extra dividend " to the 5,000,000 holders of G. I. life insurance ? " if sound insurance practices justify , it . " He had already announced that regular dividend payments for 1961 , which average $50 , would be speeded up . PROCUREMENT AND CONSTRUCTION The Secretary of Commerce is releasing to the states $724 - 000,000 of funds already authoi ized for the interstate highway , program .
