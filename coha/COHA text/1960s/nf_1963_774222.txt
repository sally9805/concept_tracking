txt  | Beethoven 's inexhaustible fertility has still more to say about his great themes which he embodies in a gigantic peroration or coda , very different from the terse little tail pieces of Haydn and Mozart . The fanfare ends and we find that by some magic its end has become the beginning of a new theme , four bars long , made up by some chemical combination out of Example i ( a and b ) . Ex. 12 . After twenty-eight bars this leads to Example 5 , but the trumpets are continuously softly reminding us of the fanfare ' ; they grow in insistence and gradually submerge everything , mounting up step by step surely to some great climax . Then a miracle happens . Suddenly the clouds lift and a mirage , like a vision of joy , appears for the moment , or , to put it in technical language , a sudden pianissimo supervenes and the themes 1(b) and 1(c) appear on the horn ( see the fugato of the development section ) in the major key for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in five octaves and the oboe gently accompanies with semiquavers . Here indeed is a foretaste of the Joy ' tune , which the materiallyminded Liszt school were not able to perceive . For those who have ears to hear the spiritual kinship is plain . But the light soon dies away . The theme is taken up by the strings in four octaves in the minor , first softly , then louder and louder , while the wind continues a little semiquaver figure . As the strings get louder the wind figure gets drowned , but as they die down again it is found that the wind is still persistently playing its part ? a wonderfully poetical conception which is , I am sure , intentional . If it is a miscalculation , it is a lucky accident . These lucky accidents do happen ? for instance , the unintentional omission of the bassoon bass in the finale , of which more later . There is once more a reference to Example 5 , which leads to a double statement of that seemingly insignificant hesitating cadence in the development ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragic force .  | But Beethoven has one more surprise in store for us ? the actual ending of the movement . The basses start softly muttering up and clown in a chromatic scale , while the wind has an entirely new phrase , and in the last sixteen bars , too . What will the text-books say ? But perhaps this theme derives in part from Example 1(a) . In that case honour and the text-books are satisfied . Over and over again the phrase repeats itself till it bursts with full power into the arpeggio phrase , and with this the movement abruptly ends . SECOND MOVEMENT ? MOLTO VIVACE Beethoven 's symphonic scherzos always retain the rhythmical dance nature which the later romantic ' symphonists were to discard . Insistent , almost hypnotically constant rhythm is characteristic of both this scherzo itself and the trio ' with which it alternates . In a scheme such as this a certain amount of formal regularity is essential to its vitality . We are not surprised , therefore , to find that each section is repeated , that there is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contrasting section and that after the trio the scherzo is repeated in its entirety . Rhythmical impulse being the basis of this movement , we naturally find that it is dominated by a rhythmical pattern J. J ) J ) , which is essentially percussive in its nature , and that the drum soon finds this out and protrudes itself in this fashion in and out of season . The opening bars , like the principal subject of the first movement , form the arpeggio of D minor , of which the D and A , tonic and fifth , are played by the strings , the F , third , by drum solo , a precursor of what is to follow , then the D , tonic , again by the whole orchestra minus the drums and the trombones . These latter instruments Beethoven reserves for later use . All this opening is in terms  | of . Note also the silent bars . Unlike later composers , Mozart , Haydn , and Beethoven seldom used their trombones merely to add to the noise but to give a solemn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After this exordium the movement starts in earnest in the shape of a five part fugue for the strings , of which this is the subject : This theme naturally divides into two sections , the opening rhythmical figure a , and a pattern of crotchets three bars long b . It is started by the second violins and played by the strings with the wood-wind just punctuating the beginning of each bar . The subject expands itself for forty-eight bars , chiefly in terms of the second half of the subject ( Example 14(b) ) . For the first thirty-six bars the music maintains a mysterious pianissimo , but from that point it begins to grow in volume till at the forty-ninth bar the complete theme bursts out with the full force of the orchestra , except for the trombones , and the theme is extended by this figure : This is played twice in D minor , and then again one tone lower . We are evidently heading for C major . Surely we should have expected F major or A minor as the complementary key ? But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes accused by the bright young things as being too much of a tonic and dominant composer , and indeed , as , for example , in the C minor Symphony , his greatest strokes of musical effect seem to grow out of this very tendency . But here , as in other works of his third period , he seems to be breaking away from this tonal scheme . Was he on the brink of a fourth period ? We shall never know . On the dominant chord of C major Beethoven introduces a new theme :  | ' Phis is the bare outline of the melody , what it sounds like , but in the store it does not look like this because it is divided up between the instruments . In Beethoven the melodic outline is ever present , but it does not always leap to the eye . We should remember Wagner 's dictum : The business of a conductor is to find out where the melody lies . ' This leads to a definite new theme in C major , in technical language the second subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strings continue to pound away at ( a ) of Example 14 . This passage is the best-known example of Beethoven 's dynamic miscalculation . If the passage is played just as it stands it is almost impossible to hear the wood-wind melody against the hammering strings . Various conductors have suggested various remedies , which need not detain us here ; none of them is quite satisfactory . When considering this and similar miscalculations we must remember that Beethoven never heard his work played . There is hardly a composer however keen his orchestral sense who does not wish to revise a few miscalculations after a first hearing . This was denied to Beethoven . Similarly , for a different reason , Schubert never heard his C major Symphony ; if he had he would without doubt have corrected a parallel miscalculation at the end of his first movement . There are orchestral miscalculations even in Wagner , which any composer less conceited than he would certainly have corrected in performance . ' But to return to our analysis : this second subject ' leads to a series of two-bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which in its turn leads to this ? note the six-bar rhythm :  | This may be a rhythmical alteration of Example 17 . And finally to a cadence figure , thus : Before we go further I want to pause a moment on the theme in six-bar rhythm , Example 18 . There is a quaint idea prevalent that Beethoven and other classical ' composers are rhythmically square ' , while the modern ' composers are rhythmically free ' . Nothing could be further from the truth . As a matter of fact , Haydn is less square than Beethoven , and Beethoven is less square than Wagner , of whose Tristan ' it has been stated that the whole three acts can be parcelled out into four-bar phrases . When we become , still more modern as in Debussy , the squareness becomes even more apparent , whole sections of his work consisting of two-bar sections each played twice . While when we come to Stravinsky and Prokofiev , one may almost say that every other two bars of their compositions could be cut out without losing any music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same is true of the pairs of bars which remain ! I can never understand why it is old-fashioned ' to have exact repetitions arranged in an architectural order , while it is modern ' to arrange the repetitions in pairs . To my mind the one is like an architect designing an arch , while the other is like an orator who habitually repeats the last sentence while he is thinking of what to say next . After the cadence , a few bars of Example 14(a) lead back to a repetition of all the first part from the beginning of the fugue . These few bars of leading back , slight as they may seem , are in a way the most important in the movement : rhythmically : note the silent bars to complete the phrases . Beethoven was capable of keeping up the rhythmical impulse in silence as well as in sound . harmonically : this middle cadence , as we know , is in C major . The opening to which we must get back is in D minor . There is no obvious relationship between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Beethoven 's return to D minor : Now this is what is known as a modal ' cadence ? it seems either to hark back to Palestrina or forward to Moussorgsky . There is , so far as I know , nothing like it in the earlier Beethoven . What is this progression doing in the work of the apostle of the tonic and dominant ' ? The composer who in the Fifth Symphony had achieved his master strokes of power and originality by the use of these universal progressions of eighteenth-century harmony ? We find this same reaching out to new vistas and new horizons in others of Beethoven 's later works , notably the Lydian Hymn ' , and parts of the Mass in D. When we consider these passages we are led to a still further line of thought . The Ninth Symphony is generally regarded as the consummation of all that has gone before it , as the perfection , with the possible exception of the choral finale , of Beethoven 's art . But is that the case ? Is it not really an adventure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art , stepping forward into an unknown region , but occasionally retreating on to familiar ground ? Is not the symphony great , perhaps because of its very experiments , hesitations and imperfections , the sudden changes of style , the tentative nature of some of the choral writing ? Is Beethoven in this symphony truly venturing toward the unknown region where neither ground is for the feet nor any path to follow ? Was Beethoven looking into a region where even he could not see clearly ? Are not the great moments great for the very reason that the composer is seeing , as in a glass darkly , what no one has ever seen before or since ?  | After the repeat the curious quasi-modal passage extends itself till it lands us in the key of E minor . There is a strange pause on the third beat of the bar J. J and the development of the fugue starts . The bassoon leads off , but in three-bar rhythm , cutting out the last bar of the subject ; this leads to a wonderful passage , the drum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butting in where it is not wanted , now takes charge of the situation . The key has shifted to F major so that the drummer comes into his own and thunders out the first bar of the subject Example 14(a) alone , while the rest of the orchestra completes the three-bar phrase for him . Then with a sly wink and a magical diminuendo , the drum misses a bar and plays his figure on the second bar of the three while the orchestra continues its crochets . The key changes , the drum has to yield to trumpets and horns , who kindly oblige with the notes the drummer can not play having only two drums at his disposal . Then we find ourselves back in the principal key , D minor , and the oboe carries on the good work . Suddenly , and without warning , the rhythm changes back to fourbar phrases , a stretto starts in the bass , there is a momentary diversion to Eb , back to D minor , and a great crescendo on a dominant pedal leads back to the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trumpets , horns , and the drummer , whenever he can fit it in , pound away consistently on the metrical figure j . J J From this tutti onwards the whole of the first part is recapitulated , with certain extensions and alterations to allow for changes of key and mode , minor or major , including the strange leading-back passage . After a final crescendo , the time quickens and leads to this angry outburst , which is as a matter of fact a foreshortening of the opening phrase : Ex. 2T . A blare on the trombone , its first appearance , announces a new section and a new theme : in technical language the Trio ' of the scherzo . This melody is what Tovey calls as old as the art of music ' .  | Perhaps it is this primitive agelessness that gives the extraordinary newness to the music , that makes it something unlike anything before or since . It consists of the notes of the scale of D up to A , and then back again , like the Duke of York and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who said : ' I could have written all that Shakespeare stuff myself if I 'd only thought of it . ' Absolute simplicity is beyond the reach of any but the greatest . Here is the melody : It is played by the wind only , with a moving bass on the bassoon , four times through without alteration . Then the strings with their rich warm colour have an answering phrase five bars long , repeated at once in varied form . Example 22 re-appears , this time on the horn , with soft light crotchets on the strings , a vision of distant blessedness . Did not Gluck use this same type of melody for his Elysian fields ? The Elysian vision swells out louder and then dies away in soft , rich chords on the trombones ; the blessed calm continues to the end except for one final cry of regret from the violins . And all of a sudden we are back in the battering turmoil of the scherzo . Before leaving the trio there is one technical point to be noticed . According to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 116 : impossibly fast . Recent scholarship has , I think , proved that this is a misreading for rJ = 116 : absurdly slow . Wise conductors obey neither marking but take a middle course . After the trio the scherzo is repeated note for note in its entirety , and we even overlap into the trio again , but the blessed vision breaks off abruptly , and with the savage outburst , Example 21 , the movement suddenly stops . I usually dislike Beethoven 's jokes intensely . But this savage piece of humour is in an entirely different category from , say , the bassoon octaves in the finale of the Eighth Symphony . So ends this amazing movement , so absolutely un-'Beethoveny ' , and yet the very quintessence of Beethoven .  | MOVEMENT ? ADAGIO MOLTO Here we are back at real period ' Beethoven , and therefore this is the movement which I like least . I know that it is all my own fault , and that the opening melody is beautiful and the first episode exquisite . I know that in my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out of my head the picture of Beethoven playing the pianoforte in a fashionable Viennese salon . And yet there are that wonderful other-worldly third Variation , or interlude , the vision of unknown regions in the coda , and the unfathomable sigh of regret at the end . Truly , this symphony is an inexplicable mystery . Technically this slow movement may be described as a set o variations separated by episodes . I. There is an introduction , two bars long , played chiefly by the wood-wind and founded on two notes out of the main theme . The theme itself is as follows : The general scheme of this melody , as will be seen , is that it is played by the strings and that the end of each phrase is echoed by the wind . At the end of the last phrase an interrupted cadence ' leads to the key of D. II . Here is the melody of the episode , with a counter melody which only comes in at its second appearance :  | EX. 24 . Then by a masterly stroke of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First Variation , an ornamentation of the melody by the first violins ; the echoes by the wood-wind are not ornamented . Ex. 25. 21I mm mmu I.issaMaalr s w mamma-mum Again we have the interrupted cadence ' , but this time it leads to G major . IV . Episode repeated , but this time in G major and with a new counter melody . Ex. 26 . At the end an exactly parallel modulation to that of its first appearance leads to Eb . V. Second Variation : A free fantasia on the theme , Tovey prefers to call it an interlude , the nomenclature does not matter . The point is that it is one of those beautiful , far-off visions of happy things which have already been noticed so frequently in this symphony . The key is Eb . The clarinet starts off with the first two bars of the theme , Example 23 ( a and b ) , in its primitive form . It proceeds to ornament the continuation of the theme in this beautiful manner ? worthy of Bach at his best . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fourth horn booms out suggestions of the opening bar of the theme . This is the famous passage which  | Beethoven wrote especially for his friend the fourth horn-player , who possessed one of those new-fangled valve horns ' . Then the key changes to Cb and the horn takes up the ornamentation , Example 27 , with magical effect . Meanwhile , the strings accompany with soft plucked notes in triplets , which during the last three bars develop into an arpeggio figure accompanying a sort of cadenza on the horn . Alas , all too soon , the music fades into the light of common day . The key returns to BE , and we reach the Third Variation . The wood-wind plays the theme in its simple form , but in compound 12/8 time , not simple 4/4 time , while the lower strings continue their pizzicato triplets and the first violins jump about in , to my mind , rather trivial arabesques . Sensible conductors keep these well in the background , as the merest accompaniment to the melody . Note , however , an entrancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreshadows the modern ' treatment of the instrument . Coda . The trumpets sound and wake us out of our complacency but only momentarily ; another variation begins , a very beautiful variant of the opening phrase played by the first violins and echoed by the flute . I do wish , however , that Beethoven had not added that mechanical ornamentation in the second bar . Ex. 28 . The theme is continued in the bass but is cut short by the menacing sound of the trumpets once again . Then follows this mysterious organ-like passage which it is worth while to quote at length ? though this condensation can , of course , give no idea of the wonderful colour scheme . What is the meaning of this stupendous passage ? It stands apart , alone and unexplained , like Stonehenge on the Wiltshire Downs . Its isolation is in no way affected by the technical fact that it is built up on the opening bar of the theme . Then once again the variant Example 28 returns , this time to lead to the second part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , over the throbbing of the strings and the gentle tapping of the drums : Is it possible that this is a reminiscence of the beautiful phrase ( Example 7 ) in the first movement ? At last , with a reference to Example 23 , the movement quietly ends . FOURTH MOVEMENT ? FINALE Now Hell breaks loose ! Wagner thought it an inadequate Hell , and wanted to improve it : his emendations are chiefly concerned with the trumpet parts . The opening chord of the finale is this grinding discord  | But the trumpets and horns in Beethoven 's day were incapable of playing both the chord of D minor and the discordant Bb , which , therefore , had to be left to the wood-wind , who , it must be confessed , perform the task rather feebly . Also Beethoven had a disconcerting habit , here and elsewhere in his tuttis , of putting notes for the trumpets where their natural ' scale fitted in to the harmony , and leaving them out where they did not , which gives a scrappy sound to the music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trumpet to fill in these gaps , but with doubtful success . It seems that the only thing to do is to take Beethoven for better , for worse , as we find him . At all events , the harsh din ' is Hellish enough to arouse a cry of remonstrance from the orchestral basses . Again the din , and once more the protest from the basses . They seem to be looking for some great tune which should solve all the doubt and dismay of what has gone before . How about the first movement ? says the orchestra ? again rejection and despair by the basses . The scherzo is next suggested ; angry dismissal by the basses . I Surely , then , the slow movement was good ? Ah ! that was lovely , ' the basses seem softly to sigh , but it wo n't do now . Quick ! let us find the solution of our troubles before it is too late ? before joy is lost for ever ! ' Then the wood-wind answers : There used in the Golden Age to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's it , ' say the basses , we are saved ; joy will once more be ours ' , and with that they start softly , serenely , and seriously to hum to themselves their immortal chant of old ' ? the Joy ' tune as it shall hereafter be called . Then the violas take up the tune ? still softly , but with full voice , while the cellos join them in a loving unison : the first bassoon improvises a heavenly descant , while the double basses far below murmur a deep foundation . It has been proved by musicologists that Beethoven intended the second bassoon to play with the double basses here , as all good  | bassoons should when the double basses are left alone , vide Prout 's Orchestration Primer , and that in printing the score it was accidentally omitted . The omission is one of those lucky accidents on which masterpieces often depend ; the unobtrusive murmur of the double basses would be quite spoilt by a snorting bassoon . Then the violins sing the tune , the bassoon helping from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter-melodies , and lastly the trumpets take up the theme and make it into a solemn march . After this last repetition Beethoven adds the refrain already discussed in these notes , which is , of course , suggested by the last phrase of the tune . This is extended , modulating in a perfectly orthodox fashion to the dominant A major , and we are led to expect a second subject ' in regular symphonic form . But suddenly the composer appears to change his mind , a little wraith of a subject appears in an uncertain manner , both as to tonality and tempo , there is an angry outburst , and suddenly Hell breaks loose again with renewed force . This time it is rebuked , not by the orchestral basses , but by the human voice crying out to them to cease this din and to sing of joy . What are we to make of all these hesitations , these apparent changes of purpose , which , as we have seen , are characteristic of the Symphony as a whole ? If we knew only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we might well guess that Beethoven originally designed a purely instrumental finale on sonata ' lines , that he changed his mind and decided instead on a choral conclusion , but that he forgot when he sent the work to the printers to cut out the  | discarded version : if this were indeed so , we should have to count it as another lucky accident , for we should have lost some of the most beautiful pages in the whole of music . The choral finale may be described technically as a set of variations with episodes , like the slow movement . After an initial shout of Freude , Freude ' , the bass soloist sings the Joy ' tune to the words of Schiller 's Ode to Joy ' . The melody is in the bass , while the oboe plays a joyful little counter-melody . The chorus joins in when the second half of the melody is played . Between each variation the refrain is repeated . The first variation is not much more than a repetition of the theme with different texture , sung by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this time in four-part harmony . The second variation is an ornamentation of the theme in quavers , which has already been referred to in these notes . Like the first variation it is sung by the solo voices and taken up by the chorus . Again the refrain follows , this time covered by heavy minim chords for the voices , and the variation finishes with a shattering modulation to F major on the words vor Gott ' ( before God ' ) . I once played this passage to a pupil well versed in modern ' harmony . I shall never forget her cry of surprise and delight at this modulation . There is a pause : then what are we to expect ? Well , Beethoven was a truly religious man , and was therefore not ashamed to place earthly jollity cheek by jowl with deep adoration . Softly we hear the grunt of the bassoon and the thump of the big drum , gradually there emerges a jolly marching tune , a variant of the ' Joy ' tune . This is , I believe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is played chiefly by the wind band , very softly . The army of joy ( freedom ? ) is advancing in the distance . Beethoven , great artist that he was , had no false shame in introducing this Turkish Patrol '  | effect . Then , against the march tune , a man 's voice is heard singing ? probably a drunken soldier . ( Feuer-trunken I assure you , Sir George Grove ! ) He is without doubt a Welshman , for he is obviously singing a Penillion ' to the principal melody , though he probably has not obeyed all the rules of Penillion ' singing . Gradually his companions join in , and the song culminates in a lusty shout . Incidentally , it should be noted that Schiller 's text here refers to the March of the Stars across the heavens . Beethoven evidently considered that the stars were jolly good fellows , fond of a rousing horus , fond of a glass of beer and a kiss from the barmaid . As the chorus finishes , the orchestra takes up the tale with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects . One , it will be seen , is made up on the march tune ; the other is a rhythmical variant of the Joy ' tune . Wagner , I believe , says that this figure means ' the hero rushing into the fight . This unfortunate explanation has been the cause of much bad music by later composers , culminating in that outrageous piece of ineptitude , the battle ' from Ein Heldenleben . It may be objected that I myself have also been giving a material meaning to Beethoven 's music . This is far from my intention . I know full well that great music has no meaning in the material sense , and annot be explained in terms of earthly facts . But , like all writers on music , I find it a convenient way , occasionally , of putting into words the scheme of the music . The fugue continues with unabated exuberance for about a hundred bars . The quaver subject is unceasing , altering and extendmg itself as the occasion requires . The march ' subject splits itself ip into two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lands us on . in 4 , the dominant of B , when the rhythm only is repeated ; then omen a diminuendo on the horns .  | The Joy ' tune puts in a claim , sadly : Have you forgotten me ? ' No , ' shouts the chorus , and plunges hurly-burly into the Joy ' tune while the strings scamper around in excited quavers . I know no parallel to this moment except perhaps the great Battle Piece ' , No. 5 of Bach 's Cantata , ' Bin ' feste Burg ' . The music ends abruptly : there is a silence . Then the trombones sound ( for the first time since the scherzo ) and the men 's voices declare the brotherhood of man . The full choir repeats the strain , then the orchestra , joined later by the chorus , with hushed voices gives the reason , that it is because man , lowly as he is , is made in God 's image . Note the wavering from , minor to major - cf. 1s1 MovemeZ Never has the mystery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colour of the strings , without violins or double basses , enriched by the soft tones of low flutes , clarinets , and bassoons . Note also the strange quasi-modal melodic and harmonic scheme .  | Then , at the words He lives beyond the stars ' , first a great shout and then an awe-struck whisper , we seem to see the whole starstudded universe and for a moment to penetrate into the mystery which lies beyond . The great shout is on the chord of Eb . The whisper is on this harmony . On this chord the strings shimmer , the wind throbs , the trombones and lower voices hold soft chords , while the women 's voices murmur , or should do so , in their highest register . Alas , how seldom this supreme creation makes its effect in performance . I usually disbelieve those who declare that they prefer reading a score to hearing it . But in this case I dread this passage in performance , and even when it is well done , I breathe a sigh of relief when it is over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortune to conduct this Symphony , I shall feel inclined to give this passage to a semichorus of picked voices , and to let the second sopranos sing the cruelly high alto part . It may be worth notice that Brahms thought this passage worth cribbing for his Requiem ' . Then joy breaks out again , joined with the assurance of the brotherhood of man in another wildly exciting double fugue , or rather , it would be wildly exciting when sung by a choir of supermen and women ; of the two subjects , the upper is a rhythmical variant of the Joy ' tune and the lower a version of the brotherhood of man ' theme .  | There is also a third subject or rather an ejaculation Freu - de ! which is thrown about from voice to voice . The fugue rises to its highest point at the famous passage where the sopranos hold the high A for twelve bars , a terror to the average choralist . Then , at the very height of the excitement , a sudden hush ; again we ponder in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . This soft unison , these augmented intervals , the repeated notes : are they not well-worn devices for expressing mystery in eighteenthcentury music ? So is the diminished seventh of Bach 's Barabbas ' a well-worn device ; so are the chromatic scales in Beethoven 's pastoral thunder-storm . But when a master hand guides these devices , they remain ever new and startling , and excite us more each time we hear them ; while the far-fetched tricks of lesser composers seem stale even the first time . This section ends with a great shout , brothers ' , and then the music softly and beautifully dies away as we once more contemplate the stars and the mysteries that lie behind them . Quite naturally , there succeeds to this a mood of childlike happiness . Beethoven did not put on his top hat when he went to church ; indeed , if he had lived in modern times he would probably have joined the Salvation Army . At all events he could pass without any feeling of impropriety from awe-full wonderment to simple merriment , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a break to riotous junketing . I am of old and young , of the foolish as much as the wise , Regardless of others , ever regardful of others ,  | Maternal as well as paternal , a child as well as a man , Stuffed with the stuff that is coarse and stuffed with the stuff that is fine , .. . The strings trip lightly on to the scene in terms of the Joy ' tune . Then follow these two childlike tunes , the second of which is incidentally a canon in four parts . Have these tunes a spiritual kinship with the Elysian ' tune in the scherzo ? The chorus now takes it share , adding a great shout All men shall be brothers ' ? but suddenly the voices are hushed when they sing of the soft wings of Joy ' . Then the music repeats itself in shortened form ; again we have the great shout of brotherhood , and again the hush , but this time it takes the form of that famous vocal cadenza which Brahms was , again , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the final cadence . The voices reach the chord of B major , with the sopranos holding the high B , then gently drop to F$t while the alto sounds Dq , making the chord of B minor . Then the bass voice softly slides down to A and we are back in the home key : this progression has been foreshadowed earlier in the movement . The orchestra takes up the idea with gusto : B , A , B , A , it repeats , over and over again , with ever-increasing speed , until at last we burst into the final unrestrained jubilation . No Sunday school about this , no angel choirs but real rowdy human beings : Pour out the wine without restraint or stay , Pour not by cups but by the belly full , Pour out to all that will . The drums thump , the cymbals crash , the trumpets blare , the chorus sing this atrociously vulgar tune :  | which nevertheless , or perhaps , therefore , is one of the great inspirations of the Symphony . But Beethoven has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climax to all this rowdyism is a sudden chorale-like paean in praise of Joy , the daughter of Elysium ' . Then once more the drums beat , the cymbals clash , the trumpets blare and in twenty quick bars the symphony is over . ( 1939 ? 40 )  | The Letter and the Spirit Whereto serve ears if that there be no sound ? LORD VAUX That the art of music is essentially one of sound is a proposition which would seem too obvious to need proof . Yet it is the opinion of many people that the really musical man prefers not to hear music , but gets at his music silently by reading it to himself as he would a book . Many years ago there appeared in Punch a picture illustrating the supposed growth in the near future of musical appreciation ; the barrel organ was to be replaced by itinerant conductors turning over the leaves of scores and beating time . The picture represents two street-boys reading the score and watching the conductor , while the following conversation takes place : " Eavenly adagio ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes the tempo too accelerato . ' Now Mr. Punch may be taken as always representing faithfully the average point of view . This then , is the average opinion , that when the street-boy becomes really musical he will no longer want to hear music but will be content to look at it . And this theory has the sanction of some of our acknowledged leaders of musical thought . Sir Henry Hadow , in an address lately published with the imprimatur of the President of the Board of Education , says : ... It is a very low order of education which does not enable a person to read a page or write a letter without reading the words aloud . The same degree of education which enables us to read a page of Shakespeare to ourselves would enable us equally well to read a page of Beethoven . ' Again Dr. Arthur Somervell is reported to have said at an educational conference : When we go into a shop to buy a book  | we do not ask the salesman to read over a few passages to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it : we read for ourselves . Yet with music how many there are who ask that the piece shall be " tried over " for them before they buy . They ought instead to be able to read it for themselves without playing or singing . ' And to quote once again , the very distinguished amateur musician , Alexander Ewing , in a letter to Dr. Ethel Smyth wrote : A work of Bach 's . . . exists for us on paper and in performance : two kinds of existence , differing in degree perhaps , but the one as real as the other . ' I venture to believe that the opinions quoted above are founded on a fallacy ? namely , that to read silently a page of Beethoven is the exact counterpart of reading silently a page of Shakespeare . Before going any further may we take it that the object of an art is to obtain a partial revelation of that which is beyond human senses and human faculties ? of that , in fact , which is spiritual ? And that the means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and faculties themselves ? The human , visible , audible and intelligible media which artists ( of all kinds ) use , are symbols not of other visible and audible things but of what lies beyond sense and knowledge . The symbols of the painter are those which can be appreciated by the eye ? colour , shapes , and the appearance of natural objects ; the symbols of the poet are words and their meaning ; and the symbols of the musical composer are those of the ear ? musical sounds in their various combinations . To say that poetry when read aloud uses the symbol of sound is only to say that poetry then borrows to a slight extent from the sister art of music . But to realize how little part the ear plays in the poetic scheme one has only to imagine the spiritual effect of , say , Homer declaimed aloud to two listeners , one who did , and the other who did not , understand Greek . If the sound was a large factor in poetry the spiritual effect on both hearers would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of declamation in an unknown language is almost negligible , and the reaction to the stimulus must be referred to music rather than to poetry . To a listener who understands the meaning of the words the actual sound of those words has a powerful emotional effect but only in connexion with the meaning and  | association of the words spoken . When a poem is read in silence the , und is absent , but the meaning of the words with all they symbolize is still there . Where is the symbolic effect of a printed page of music ? Can a page of musical notes and a page of poetry be compared in any way ? It seems absurd to ask such a question ; yet it is necessary , because there is a widespread notion ( shared as we have seen by some of the most distinguished musical thinkers ) that a printed page of music is the exact parallel of a painted picture or a printed poem . The art of music differs from poetry and painting in this , that it involves two distinct processes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just possible that in very primitive kinds of musical improvisation the acts of invention and presentation may be simultaneous . But it is difficult to say there are any cases in which the of invention did not slightly precede the act of presentation ; at events in the ordinary case of a composer singing or playing his awn composition he is simply acting in a dual capacity , first that of composer and then that of performer ; the two processes are quite distinct . In the other arts this is not so ; the invention and presentation are one process . The painter paints his picture , and it is a complete work of art ; all that is needed further is a pair of eyes and the heart vid mind to realize what one sees . The poet writes his poem , and there it is for everyone who has learnt to read and who understands the meaning of words . But a musical composition when invented ts only half finished , and until actual sound is produced that composition does not exist . How then is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If it is a single line of melody or capable of being played on one instrument he may be able to complete the work himself . But how if his invention requires more than one voice or Instrument ? Then he must seek out others who are capable of making the sounds he desires and must instruct them when and where to make the sounds . For this purpose a clumsy and unprecise ode of written signals has been evolved , which by convention ntdicate that certain sounds are to be made . This code of signals or series of orders is known as a musical  | score , and has about as much to do with music as a time table has to do with a railway journey . What the musical composer , in effect , says to his performers is : I desire to produce a certain spiritual result on certain people ; I hope and believe that if you blow , and scrape , and hit in a particular manner this spiritual effect will result . For this purpose I have arranged with you a code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain dot or dash or circle , you will make a particular sound ; if you follow these directions closely my invention will become music , but until you make the indicated sounds my music does not exist . ' So a musical score is merely an indication of potential music , and moreover it is a most clumsy and ill-devised indication . How clumsy it is may be seen from the importance of the individual renderings ' of any piece of music . If a composer could indicate what he wanted with any precision there would be no room for this ; as it is , two singers or players may follow faithfully the composer 's intentions as given in the written notes and produce widely different results . Under our present system of musical notation the composer can give only the most general indication of what he wishes . Perhaps future generations will devise something more precise ; though whether this will be an advantage is doubtful . The art of music , then , requires two minds ( or one mind acting in two distinct ways ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presenter , or , in other words , the composer and the performer . If the composer is wise he will not try to make his score fool-proof , but will wait for that twin-mind which will translate his imaginings into sound , and consummate that marriage of true minds which alone can give his music life . It is , of course , not to be denied that the power to realize to a certain extent by visual inspection what sounds will result from this code of signals ( in other words to read a score ) is an almost necessary part of a musician 's equipment ; but this power will not make him musical , any more than the knowledge of machinery which is necessary to a watchmaker enables him to tell the time . It is also true that the pleasure and exaltation of spirit of a certain kind is the result of this power ; more especially is this true of the  | pleasure of memory evoked by reading the score of a well-known and often heard work . A musical score is like a map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of country he is going to visit , whether it is hilly or flat , whether the hills are steep or gradual , whether it is wooded or bare , what the roads are likely to be ; but can he experience from a map the spiritual exaltation when a wonderful view spreads before his eyes , or the joy of careering downhill on a bicycle or , above all , the sense of rest and comfort induced by the factual realization of those prophetic letters ' P.H. ' ? So it is with music ; the pleasure and profit of reading a score silently is at the best purely intellectual , at the worst it is nothing more than the satisfaction of having accomplished a difficult task successfully . It is not the pleasure of music . This can be achieved through the ear only . In what does being musical ' consist ? It should be possible to be a first-rate musician and yet not be able to read a note of music , never to have heard of Bach or Beethoven , nor to know by sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversely it is possible to know all these things and yet be no musician . To be really musical one must be able to hear . The ear must be sensitive , the mind must be quick to grasp what the ear has heard and see its connexion with what has gone before , and to be prepared for what is to come , and above all the imagination must be vivid , to see the glimpses of the heart of things which the composer has crystallized into earthly sound . To educate a child in music is to teach him to hear ; then , and then only , is he a musician . I am far from saying that the power to read music , the knowledge of musical history , an intelligent interest the technique of instruments will not be a great help to him when once he has learnt to love music , but they must never be allowed to take the place of music ; we must first seek the Kingdom of God and all these things will be added unto us . How does the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he makes with the mind 's ear only ? But what is it which he invents ? Not the little black dots which he puts down on paper but the actual sounds those black dots represent . He wishes to be in spiritual communication with his hearers . To do that certain sounds  | are necessary ; and until those sounds are heard the contact is not established . And does not the composer also need actual sound to produce in him that spiritual state which he hopes to induce in others ? Does not the actual shock of sound help to fertilize his imagination and lead him on to still further musical invention ? The text-books , of course , are horrified at the idea of composing at the piano ' ( as R. O. Morris writes , it is always considered as not quite playing the game ' ) and hold it to be the sign of the incompetent amateur . The answer is that everyone must use the means which enable him to do the best . If the composer finds inspiration in the bass trombone or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is fairly conclusive evidence that Beethoven , Wagner , and Elgar used the pianoforte in the course of composition and that Berlioz and Rheinberger did not . The inference is obvious . In primitive times the intervention of the written note between the composer and the performer did not exist . The primitive composer either sang his simple melodies himself or else taught them orally to others ; and there is , theoretically , no reason why a composer should not invent a symphony and teach it to an orchestra of performers without writing down a note , provided both he and they could cope with such a prodigious feat of mind and memory . The writing of notes is merely a convenience , necessary owing to the comparative feebleness of our memories and the want of concentration in our minds . To hold up this mere convenience as an ideal to be aimed at is surely to put the cart before the horse . We have taken it for granted up to now that an expert musician can mentally hear the sound of any piece of music ? that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can realize exactly what the effect on him of every harmony , melody , or rhythm which he sees written , would be if he heard it . But how far is this true ? Doubtless when the music is simple or of an accustomed type , the musician is on sure ground ; but when anything in an unaccustomed idiom comes his way , is he not often out of his depth when trusting to the eye alone ? Even in the - case of comparatively simple music is it not possible to realize mentally the whole sound and yet miss the beauty ? Any fairly equipped musician can look through a piece , say , of Purcell and realize exactly how all the notes would sound , but can he be sure whether he has realized its beauty ?  | Or to take a simpler example still ? is it not a common experience with anyone to look through a single line of melody like a folksong and be entirely deaf to its emotional appeal until he has heard it sung ? But a musician may answer : I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as beautiful if I can see beauty in it by a silent reading of the score . ' Yes , ' I should answer , but how if you can not see beauty in it ? Will you then trust your judgement ? Will you not feel bound to hold it up to the test of the ear ? If not , you have not given it a fair judgement . ' Why is it that it is always the dull unimaginative music which gains the prize in a competition ? Is it not because the adjudicators are content to look at the music and not to hear it ? with the result that anything which looks right on paper is judged to be good , and everything that looks unfamiliar and awkward is rejected ? Are we then to be slaves of our bodies ? Will not the mind be able eventually to free itself from all bodily trammels and get to the essence of things without physical intermediaries ? It may indeed be argued that when we are actually hearing music the physical ear plays only a small part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do no more than receive one moment of sound at a time , and our grasp of even the simplest tune depends on our power of remembering what has gone before and of co-ordinating it with what comes after . So that it seems that the mind and the memory play an even more important part than the ear in appreciating music . Why not go one step further and eliminate the physical ear altogether ? Let us hear music with the mind 's ear only . Perhaps in future years this will happen ? a new art will be evolved in which the mind of the composer will be in direct touch with his audience . But this art will not be music ? it will be a new art ; and with the new art a new set of means of communication will have to be devised . Our old system of dots and dashes which go to make up a music score , are , as we have seen , no more than a code of directions to the makers of musical sounds ; if the sounds are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer be necessary , and our score-reader 's occupation will be gone . Certain types of musical thinkers seem to have inherited the  | medieval fear of beauty ? they talk about mere beauty ' and mere sound ' as if they were something to be feared and avoided . But in our imperfect existence what means have we of reaching out to that which is beyond the senses but through those very senses ? Would Ulysses have been obliged ' to be lashed to the mast if the sirens instead of singing to him had shown him a printed score ? When the trumpet sounding the charge rouses the soldier to frenzy , does anyone suggest that it would have just the same effect if he took a surreptitious glance at Military Sounds and Signals ? Would any amount of study of his own score have led Haydn to declare that his Let there be Light ' came straight from Heaven ? Surely , while music is the art of sound , it is the ear which must be taught its language ; when a new art supersedes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( 1920 )  | Gustav Hoist : An Essay and a Note In claiming for Gustav Hoist that he is essentially a modern composer , I am from the outset laying myself open to misconstruction . The word modern ' has been much abused , but I would point out that there is all the difference in the world between music which is modern and that which is in the modem idiom ' . The modern idiom ' consists of a handful of cliches of instrumentation coupled with a harmonic texture watered down from the writings of composers who flourished twenty-five years ago . With this kind of thing Hoist 's music has nothing to do ; he does not serve up all the harmonic tricks of the last quarter of a century , he does not introduce a major ninth ' regularly every eight bars , he is not afraid of long tunes ( he has often the courage to let them stand alone , or with the merest suggestion of harmony ) ; I he is not always making eight horns bellow out high D 's , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to Wilbye ; and yet ( or perhaps therefore ) he is one of the few composers who can be called truly modern . Modernity does not depend on certain tricks of diction but on the relationship between the mind that expresses and the means of expression . The modern mind needs a modern vocabulary , but the vocabulary will not make the modern mind . Some composers have the modem mind but have not found the idiom which suits it , many more have all the tricks of diction but not the informing mind . We are told that Richard Strauss is a modem of the modems ' but this is only superficially true ; his mind is as early Victorian as that of his father-in-music Liszt ? Strauss 's music is nothing more Footnote  | than Liszt plus one . Mentally he wallows in the German sentimentalism of the ' fifties . Delius , again , in spite of his bewitching harmonic experiments ( or is it because of them ? ) , belongs mentally to the ' eighties . Mr. Bernard Shaw has written recently that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Stravinsky music by the thousand bars for fun in his spare time ' . Doubtless he could ; but the result would probably be worthless because it would not be to him a natural mode of diction , while Stravinsky 's own music is valuable in so far as his style is a real utterance . In the same way Stravinsky could probably , if he chose , write a colourable imitation of Elgar ; but it would certainly miss the qualities which make the Variations and the slow movement of the Second Symphony beautiful music . If Holst 's music is modem it is not that he has acquired a few tricks which today are hailed with wonder and tomorrow are as flat as stale ginger-beer but that he has a mind which is the heir of all the centuries and has found out the language in which to express that mind . He shows his modernity equally whether he is straining our harmonic sense to breaking point as in this example from the Hymn of Jesus :  | Or writing a simple broad melody like the middle section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Incidentally , it is a pity that this theme is hidden in the middle of Jupiter ' which it does not seem altogether to fit . It ought to be the climax of some great movement which would take the place in the public affections of the sentimentalities of Finlandia . Or it might be used by the League of the Arts , set to appropriate words ( not the rhyming homilies of the Motherland Song Book ) and sung at points of vantage when next we have a peace celebration ( which heaven forfend ) . Indeed , Holst 's work never sounds modern ' in the narrow sense of the word ( except now and then when he is exceptionally off his stroke ) and the reason is that he knows what he wants to say and the way in which he means to say it . There is no attempt to tickle jaded nerves with new effects ' and thus the very strangeness of much of his harmonic texture escapes the notice of the curio hunter , because it is absolutely germane to the whole conception . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? it is so masterly that it escapes notice . Again the curio hunter is foiled . He hears no squeaks on the piccolo or grunts on the bass-tuba to make him sit  | up and say modern orchestration ' ( though the strange devices are there all the same ? for example the glissando for full organ in Uranus ' ) . Hoist knows his orchestra from the inside , having been an orchestral player ; he does what he wants with it without conscious effort , and the result is that we think not of the orchestration , but of the music . When one is sitting in a Rolls Royce one may be travelling sixty miles an hour , but it does not feel like it . The modernity of Hoist is the result of the simple fact that he is a modern Englishman and that his music is in direct relation with real life ; moreover he has not shrunk from life , but has lived it intensely . To live ' is an expression which has had much harm done it by second-rate writers who seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like absinthe and keeping a mistress in Montmartre . But Holst has pursued the calling of a hard-working , revered , and inspiring teacher , he has been a good citizen , a firm friend , a reliable helper in time of trouble . If to have lived ' it is necessary to have eloped with a prima donna , to have played mean tricks on  | one 's friends , to be dirty and drunken ? if life means no more than +hat , then indeed the word has little meaning for a man like Hoist . fiat if to live may be summed up in the words Whatsoever thy Land fmdeth to do , do it with thy might ' , then Hoist has lived to the full ; he has learnt his lesson in the hard school of necessity ; he has not run away from the battle but has fought and won . So many artists are conquered by life and its realities . Moneymaking , marriage , family cares , all the practical things of life are too much for them , and as artists they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Hoist the interests , responsibilities , and realities of life are not a hindrance but a stimulus ? they are the very stuff out of which he has knit his art , the soil on which it flourishes . To a foolish friend who once said to him : I suppose you did not marry to help your composition ' , he answered : That is exactly what I did do . ' Life and art are to Hoist not enemies but the complements of each other ; and as time goes on and his life gets busier and more varied , his artistic production becomes larger and finer , his style more mature , pronounced , and individual . The Bohemian is not a natural growth in England . Our Cafe Royals , our Chelsea Arts Balls , our all-night clubs are shams : importations from Paris which have suffered a good deal on the voyage . It is not on such a basis as this that our English art will grow , and it may be well to add here that in spite of all temptations ' which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On his mother 's and grandmother 's side he is pure English ; on his father 's side there is Swedish blood , but the Hoist family came to England from Riga , where they had been long settled , more than a hundred years ago . There is a good deal of unclear thinking prevalent on the subject of race and nationality . Everyone is to a certain extent of mixed race . But race is only one factor in nationality ; it is community of language , of customs , of laws , of religion as well as racial kinship , which binds men into a nation , and judged by these standards we should expect Hoist 's music to be the outcome of the English point of view . We may sum up Hoist 's characteristics as exemplified in his life and reflected in his art as great force of character , indomitable energy , sense of thoroughness , and above all intense human sympathy . Naturally frail in body and handicapped from the outset by a  | delicate childhood , he has done more work than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only just the wrong side of forty , his works include four operas , seven large works for orchestra and military band , two long scenas for solo voice and orchestra , three large compositions for chorus and orchestra and a huge quantity of shorter pieces of all kinds ; besides which he has had to work hard at his profession of teacher , since his natural bent has led him to interesting rather than largely remunerative pupils . His energy and force of character show themselves in various ways ; he has always been a great walker and in student days when money was scarce he would spend part of his holiday walking from London to his home in Gloucestershire . He is a wide reader and an original thinker on all subjects ; when he was already approaching middle age , and though early ill-health and the necessity of entering his profession young cut short his classical education at mensa , mensae , he set to work to learn enough Sanskrit to be able ( with a crib ' , of course , as all good scholars do ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which so much of his music is based . It was his feeling for thoroughness which led him when he left the College of Music to abandon the eminently respectable career of an organist for which he was destined and to get at music from the inside as a trombonist in an orchestra . Holst has sometimes thought that all the trashy music he had to endure in these early days has had a bad influence on his art . Personally I do not think so . To start with , the very worst that a trombonist has to put up with is as nothing compared to what a church organist has to endure ; and secondly , Holst is above all an orchestral composer , and that sure touch which distinguishes his orchestral writing is due largely to the fact that he has been an orchestral player ; he has learnt his art , both technically and in substance , not at second hand from text-books and models but from actual live experience . Holst has no use for half measures ; all the little vanities , insincerities , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely outside his ken ; they leave him dumb and puzzled and at these moments he seems to retire from the world which we call real ' into a mystical world of his own . To know all is to forgive all , and in early days , when Holst 's knowledge of human weakness was less than it is now , his sincerity and thoroughness occasionally  | brought him into conflict with the half-hearted standards of the world ; I remember a certain choral society which in his youthful enthusiasm he over-dosed with Bach 's cantatas , with the result that he was asked to retire in favour of some other conductor and the society returned to its wallowing in the mire . It was Hoist 's strong sense of human sympathy which brought him when a young man into contact with William Morris and the Kelmscott Club . The tawdriness of London , its unfriendliness , the sordidness both of its riches and poverty were overwhelming to an enthusiastic and sensitive youth ; and to him the ideals of Morris , the insistence on beauty in every detail of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder then that the poetic socialism of the Kelmscott Club became the natural medium of his aspirations ; to Morris and his followers comradeship ' was no pose but an absolute necessity of life . And though as years go on Hoist has grown out of the weak points in Morris 's teaching , yet his ideal of thoroughness , of beauty and above all of comradeship have remained and grown stronger . It is this almost mystical sense of unity which is the secret of Hoist 's power as a teacher . He writes himself of ' the wonderful feeling of unity with one 's pupils when teaching , a feeling of contact with their minds other than the contact occasioned by speech ' . z Like all great teachers Holst not only gives but expects to receive , and he will have no half measures : he is sympathetic to ignorance , over-exuberance , or even stupidity ? but half-heartedness , insincerity , or laziness have no chance with him ; for that reason he will never become a ' fashionable ' teacher whose metier is to impart useless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Everyone who comes to Hoist must take music seriously ? indeed they can not help it ? and it is his very insistence which has made the success of his musical directorship of Morley College . When he first began teaching there he found music treated as a side issue ? a sort of decoy to attract students to the College . The authorities were rather alarmed when he openly rejoiced at the fact that the old type of music student began to fall off when he took over the directorship , and there was the inevitable anxious period when the old students left and the new ones had not begun Footnote  | to arrive . The directors looked glum and seriously thought of asking Hoist to resign ; but in the end he won through , the right students came flocking in ? those who really wanted to learn ? and now the authorities recognize the music classes at Morley ' as one of their greatest assets . One of the outstanding events of Hoist 's connexion with Morley College was the performance in concert form of Purcell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since Purcell 's time ) . The work of preparation was enormous , everyone worked like a slave ( indeed one has to when Holst drives , he spares neither himself nor others ) , every part had to be copied in manuscript , sometimes transposed and re-arranged to suit the limited resources of the College . It is to this performance that we largely owe the magnificent stage production of this work at Cambridge last February , and the fact that the score is now printed in available form and has taken its place as one of our classics . With all his idealism and mysticism Hoist has never allowed himself to become a mere dreamer . He is a visionary but he never allows dreams to inhibit action . He has also a strong saving sense of humour ? indeed he might , if he had chosen , have made a name for himself as a comedy actor . His letters , in their peculiar but beautifully clear handwriting , are a precious possession to his friends .  | As in his life so in his art Holst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the greatest effect if he wants to as in the preceding passage from the Funeral Hymn ' . Or if he wants a harmonic clash he makes a complete one , he never lets one off lightly ? as this example from Neptune ' will show . Andante That he is not afraid of a tune we have already seen in the example on page 132 . Perhaps , sometimes , his rhythms and melodies may appear a little too pungent for timid souls , as this example ( from Jupiter ' ) :  | Or perhaps some hearers may find a sense of strain in some of his later music ; probably the strain is with the hearer rather than with the composer . Recently Hoist 's work appeared at a concert side by side with a composition in which all the commonplaces of the last fifty years were neatly laid out in rows . A critic described this work as far more satisfactory ' than Hoist 's . He was right ; Hoist 's work is not always satisfactory ' ? it is not meant to be satisfactory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncomfortable ? and why not ? We live in uncomfortable times just now : we live in dread of what the future may bring . And such a work as Neptune ' ( the mystic ) seems to give us such a glance into the Allegretto  | future ? it ends , so to speak , on a note of interrogation . Many composers have attempted this , sometimes bringing in the common chord at the end as an unwilling tribute to tradition , sometimes sophisticating it by the addition of one discordant note , sometimes letting the whole thin out into a single line of melody ; but Holst in Neptune ' actually causes the music to fade away to nothing . It is of the essence of modern music , as of all modem thought , to drive straight to the root of the matter in hand without artifice or subterfuge ; to let the matter rule the form , not the form the matter ; to obtain our rules from practice , not our practice from rules . Hoist , as we have seen , is a practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses the most direct way of saying it . If he desires that a melody shall sound remote from its harmonic context he does not hesitate to make it remote ? he does not compromise by making it look as if it fitted ' . Equally , if he so wishes , he uses successions of sevenths or triads without any attempt to disguise them into respectability . I can not illustrate this better than by two quotions from The Planets , from Saturn ' and Mars ' . A large and important part of Hoist 's musical work consists of setting of hymns and lyrics from the Rig Veda and other Sanskrit  | poetry . The fact that the originals of these poems are oriental has led people to expect a sort of pseudo-orientalism in his music . Nothing could be further either from his intention or his achievement . Hoist has written only one definite piece of orientalism , namely , the brilliant tour-de-force Beni Mora , a work which if it had been played in Paris instead of London would have given its composer a European reputation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( It will hardly be believed that neither this work nor The Planets has yet 1920 found a publisher . ) But it is not the orientalism but the mysticism of the Vedic Hymns which attracted Hoist , he needed some expression of the mystical point of view less materialized and less systematized than anything to be found in occidental liturgies . In the Rig Veda personification of the unknown is reduced to a minimum . He the primal one Begetter of the universe Begotten in mystery . How shall we name him When we offer sacrifice ?  | These settings of Eastern texts culminate in the magnificent choral song The Cloud Messenger , but the spirit which dictates them is in all essentials the same which prompted his musical expression in the Hymn of Jesus and the Ode to Death . The mystical frame of mind naturally begets a certain austerity in Hoist 's later music . Austerity is sometimes a cover for artistic impotence ; the composer says I will not ' when he means I can not ' . This negative austerity is not , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative , his very faults are those of commission not of omission . His austerity leads not to dullness or emptiness , but to harmony which is acrid rather than luscious , melody sometimes angular but never indefinite or sugary , orchestration which is brilliant and virile but not cloying . Among the purely musical influences which have affected Holst we may count a boyish devotion to Grieg which influenced his student work and occasionally crops up even in his later music , without in the least detracting from its individuality . Again it goes without saying that Hoist , like every young musician who approached manhood in 1890 , came strongly under the influence of Wagner ; the chief relic of this influence is the three-act opera Sita in which much beautiful music lies hidden in a rather intractable medium . That Hoist knows and loves his Bach is evident from the following quotation from the comparatively early Mystic Trumpeter . Moderato  | It was to a mind thus familiar , both as student and performer , with all the most modern devices of music that a new field of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by the publication of the masses and motets of Byrd and Dr. Fellowes 's great edition of the English madrigalists . These came as a revelation to Hoist , as to many other musicians ; he quickly imbibed their spirit without abating one jot of his individuality or in any way harking back to a sham archaism . We can see the spirit of his great ancestors in such works as the Hymn of Jesus or the t opening of Hecuba 's Lament . Another very marked influence on Hoist 's musical thought must not be omitted here . The subject of English folk-song is a thorny one and has been much misunderstood . It would be out of place to discuss it at length now ; but this much may be said , that , to those who have understanding , the folk-song is a liberating and not a fettering influence . The contact with new types of melody bound by purely melodic considerations , with rhythms not tied by the convention of bars and time signatures , the expressiveness of short and simple tunes ? all this can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new vistas of musical thought which may , indeed , have nothing to do superficially with the curves and cadences of folk-song , but are suggested by its spirit if not by its letter . Hoist 's first introduction to his traditional melodies was in a collection of songs from Hampshire which he harmonized at the request of the late Dr. Gardiner . Such arrangements as the following must have come as rather a shock to those accustomed to the unpretending harmonies of English County Songs or Folk Songs from Somerset , and it must be confessed that they are not too well suited to their immediate purpose .  | But Holst was finding out what folk-song had to say to him and what he had to say to it , and in his latest essay in this form , the beautiful setting of the White Paternoster ' tune , the melody and its treatment are absolutely at one . Whatever the influence may have been it is obvious that Holst has freed himself from all conventions in the matter of rhythm and 1iielody . If the nature of the musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seven such rhythms ? indeed , rhythms of five or seven are characteristic of much of his later work . He often employs what we call for want of a better word modal ' melodies ( that is in other modes than the major and minor ) . Many people seem to consider that modal ' melody and its corresponding harmony is a return to something archaic . We are told in the text-books that the harmony of Palestrina and his school is ' modal ' . This , surely , is a fallacy . The two great sources of modal melody are the plainsong and the folk-song , and for this reason , that they are both purely melodic in their conception ( the major and minor modes grew up from harmonic considerations ) . Now the music of the great choral period originates in attempts to harmonize these purely melodic plainsong tunes ? but for some reason which no one has , so far as I know , investigated , these early harmonists found that the intervals of the melodic modes did not fit in with their harmonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their purpose in accordance with the system known as nrusica ficta ' , until the various modes all merged into the major and m ninor of the great classical period , and ( except for one or two experiments such as Beethoven 's Lydian Hymn ' ) up to quite modern times the major and minor modes were the basis of all music .  | The harmonic possibilities of the purely melodic modes occurred , probably , first to the nationalist Russian composers ; following on them we find Erik Satie using them in his earlier works ; and from him , in turn , Debussy obtained suggestions for such things as his Sarabande ' and the ' Fille aux cheveux de lin ' . Here is an example of a melody full of modal suggestions from  | It is sometimes argued that the particular idiom which a composer uses is a mere accident , that the fountain of inspiration flows or does not flow as the case may be , and that the particular vessel into which it flows is of no consequence . But idiom is part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the true way of materializing these emotions has also to be found . Many a composer who has had potentially much to say has failed because he did not discover the vocabulary from which he could choose the necessary means of expression . Of course , every true composer makes his own idiom . But bricks are not to be made without straw ; and it can not be doubted that the folk-song with its melodic curves , its free rhythm , its simplicity , and its sincerity has played its humble part in giving a tendency and direction to many composers to whom it was naturally sympathetic . I am far from saying that there are no weak points in Hoist 's music ? what piece of music has not its weak points ? Did not Wagner fail at the very climax of his life work ? When Briinnhilde throws herself on the flames as an act of supreme sacrifice some superhumanly beautiful melody was the only possible musical  | equivalent ? but at that moment Wagner could invent nothing better than a tune which is hardly good enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can think of no piece of music ( with the possible exception of the Sanctus ' from Palestrina 's Missa Brevis ) which can be said to be absolutely without flaw . Hoist 's weaknesses are the defects of his qualities ? occasionally his magnificent technique masters him and the end gets lost in the means . Sometimes he spoils the noble simplicity of his work by an unnecessary piece of elaboration : at other times the very individuality of his thought which requires such a personal technique causes a flaw in his work ; in his earlier music especially we do not always find complete unity of idea and expression ; the mot juste fails him for the moment and he falls back on the common stock of musical device . But the very fact that these lapses are noticeable only goes to show how individual his music is . As time goes on these discrepancies get fewer and fewer and his style gets maturer , simpler and more individual , and this individuality shows through all his music ; whether it is in the most extreme harmonic and rhythmical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four Carols , his signature is plain on every page . There may be occasional moments in Hoist 's harmony which are not quite in the approved grand manner ' . Sometimes we are pulled up in the middle of his most beautiful work by a melodic phrase which appears undistinguished ( as for example a phrase in the Hymn of Jesus which has been adversely criticized ) . But these blemishes ( if they are such ) are the direct outcome of his vitality ? he will never be content to say nothing in particular and say it very well ' . If the harmony occasionally exhibits an error of style , it is because the intention at that moment became over-exuberant ; if the melodic inspiration does not quite always hit the mark ( as happens to all composers at times ) it is because the composer is too honest and too whole-hearted to hide it under an indistinct muttering in the accepted style . Holst 's three last important works , The Planets , the Hymn of Jesus , and the Ode to Death , seem to sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mature and perfect forms all that he has been striving for with more or less success in his earlier works . To one who has had the privilege of his friendship for the last twenty-five  | years , and has seen most of his compositions actually in the course of completion , it has been most interesting to watch the growth to maturity of a set , though perhaps unconscious , artistic purpose , to see experiments , at first perhaps not wholly successful , develop into finished methods of artistic expression , to sec crudities gradually disappear and give place to maturity . I can not show this development better than by two quotations in which the same musical thought is evident , one from the early Mystic Trumpeter ' and the other from Venus ' ( The Bringer of Peace ) . The Planets consist of seven orchestral movements named after the seven planets with their various astrological characteristics . MYSTIC TRUMPETER Andante The fretting world , the streets , the not - sy hours of day with-  | They are : i . Mars ( The Bringer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peace ) . 3 . Mercury ( The Winged Messenger ) . 4 . Jupiter ( The Bringer of Jollity ) . 5 . Saturn ( The Bringer of Old Age ) . 6 . Uranus ( The Magician ) . 7 . Neptune ( The Mystic ) . They are in no sense programme music , the titles suggest the general character of the music and no more . The most individual and beautiful seem to me to be Venus ( though the middle section is not quite so good as the rest ) , Saturn , Jupiter , and Neptune . Mercury is very brilliant and Uranus will probably be considered great fun ' , but to my mind they are not musically up to the level of the rest . Hoist uses a very large orchestra in The Planets , not to make his score look impressive , but because he needs the extra tone colour and knows how to use it . The text of the Hymn of Jesus is taken from the apocryphal Acts  | f St. John and is almost ideal for musical setting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mystical dance , as the words suggest ) and consists chiefly of a series of antiphonal phrases with an ever recurrent Amen ' . Hoist has used two choruses which sing antiphonally for the most part , joining forces occasionally for a great outburst on the words Glory to Thee ' . There is also a semichorus which sings the recurring Amen ' . Many musicians have set the Amen ' to music ? from the unknown composer of the Dresden ' Amen down to the too-well-known composer of the Sevenfold ' Amen . In this hierarchy Hoist 's Amen ' will surely take a high place by reason of its ethereal beauty . The Ode to Death is a setting for chorus and orchestra of part of Whitman 's President Lincoln 's Funeral Hymn ' . This has not yet 11920 been published or performed . Like the Hymn of Jesus it is a real work for chorus and orchestra ? the orchestra is not occupied in doubling ( and drowning ) the chorus parts , but plays its independent part ? the choral technique is characteristic of Hoist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These three works represent Hoist in his latest and maturest stage . What the future may have in store we can not say ? whether he will become simpler , or whether he will lead us into new paths where it will be difficult to follow ; but of this we may be sure that there will be good reason behind whatever he does . He will not be simple merely through timidity , nor will he seek out strange  | devices merely for the sake of eccentricity ; he knows too well that whatever the future of music may be , it will always grow out of its great past . 1920 ) Some years ago I had the privilege of writing about Gustav Hoist . I remember saying then that perhaps he will lead us into regions where it will be difficult to follow ' . He may have now found in new regions that which his music ever seemed to be seeking . All art is the imperfect human half-realization of that which is spiritually perfect . Hoist 's music seems especially to be a quest after that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This does not mean that his music was ever inchoate or groping . He had complete command of method . He was a visionary , but not an idle dreamer . He himself used to say that only second-rate artists were unbusinesslike . At the same time his music has pre-eminently that quality which for want of a better word we call mystical ' , and this in spite of the fact that it was never vague or meandering : in all his works , whether in life or art , he was absolutely clear and definite . Indeed his music is usually robust and never shirks a definite tune when the occasion demands it . In spite of his masterful command of harmonic resource he never lets chordal complications interfere with clear outline and definite expression . It is perhaps this very clarity which gives the mystical ' quality to his music . It burns like a clear flame for ever hovering on the ' frontier to eyes invisible ' . We all experience at times , most of us momentarily only , a vision beyond earthly sense . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him outside the makeshifts and half-heartednesses and inconsistencies and compromises and insincerities that go to make up our daily life . Everything untrue or slovenly shrinks in his presence . In his life as in his art he seemed to be standing on the verge of ultimate truth . For this reason his music has sometimes been described as inhuman and aloof . If this means that Hoist never vied with the man with the muck-rake ' we will willingly and thankfully endorse the criticism , but for those for whom humanity means something else than morbid abnormality Hoist 's music is triumphantly human . A  | pure light always burnt in him , but he never lost sight of human possibilities ; his writing is never unpractical , he demands much of his players and singers , from his singers especially , but he knew from long experience what even the most unpromising performers could achieve with enthusiasm , hard work , sure purpose , and good guidance . It was these qualities ? intense idealism of conception coupled with complete realism in practice , guided by his strong sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they made him a great composer . I have myself known Holst as friend and teacher for more than thirty years . When I had a new work in the beginning stages my first idea would always be to show it to him . But sometimes I let a work go without his advice and counsel . I probably felt that there was some lapse in it from the highest endeavour and I felt ashamed to submit it to that truthful gaze . When this has been so I have always regretted it . I might have suffered in my self-pride from his judgement , but both my music and myself would have been the better for it . The gift of inspiration is perhaps not so rare as we think . What is rare is the power of final realization in picture , poem , or music of that inspiration . This fmal realization is essential to a complete work of art . This power Holst possessed to the full . He never falters or gropes . He knows what he wants to say and says it without subterfuge or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from books or in the study as from practical experience and from the nature of his material : not that he neglected book learning , and present-day students might note to their advantage that he spent several months previous to his entry at the College studying nothing but strict counterpoint . It was necessity as well as choice which brought Holst early face to face with the facts of music . Already in his student days he , like many others , had to be earning his living . He chose deliberately not to shut himself up in the organ loft or to give half-hearted pianoforte lessons to unwilling pupils , but to go out into the world armed with his trombone , playing , now in a symphony orchestra , now in a dance band , now in a Christmas pantomime in a suburban theatre . A reminiscence of these days still lives in my mind . At the end of our summer holidays some of us students met together to tell each other how we had spent our vacation . One of us had been at Bayreuth and gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the proceedings . Others , perhaps , had been to the Dolomites or to Brittany and were doubtless very poetical about it . In all this we listeners were mildly interested , but what remained in the memory of those who heard him was Holst 's enthralling account of his experiences as a member of a seaside band , enthralling because of his great human sympathy , his unique humour , his strong sense of values . In later years other activities , teaching and conducting , added to his experience which gave him that grip of the facts of music out of which he built up his wonderful technique . To many men this constant occupation with the practical side of art would have been a hindrance to inspiration , but to Holst it seemed to be an incentive . The fact that his creative work had often to be crowded into the few weeks of summer vacation gave him his great power of concentration and intensified his will to evoke at all costs those thoughts that lay in the depths of his being . Holst had no use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted to say he said forcibly and directly . Like every other great composer he was not afraid of being obvious when the case demanded it ? nor did he hesitate to be recondite on the right occasion . But whether he gives us the familiar chords and straightforward tunes of Jupiter ' or leads us to the remotest confines of harmony as in Neptune ' his meaning is never in doubt ; he has something to tell us that only he can say . I used sometimes to think that Holst occasionally pushed his love of definiteness too far . I remember once discussing Egdon Heath ' with him . I suggested that the very clearness of the melodic outlines of that piece were at variance with its atmospheric nature ; indeed that less robust melody would have been more successful in impressionistic suggestion . Holst , on that occasion , lived up to his own maxim Always ask for advice , but never take it . ' I am glad that he did so for I now see that a less clear melody would have softened and thereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , I believe , find his melody too strong and his rhythm too pungent for their effeminate taste . However this may be no one can ignore it . Whenever he puts pen to paper the signature Gustav Holst ' is clear to read in every bar of the music . ( 1934  | Nationalism and Internationalism I believe that it was George Trevelyan who , in one of his early essays , wrote that the ideal would be for every nation to be different and all at peace ; adding , prophetically , that what we are tending towards is to be all alike and all at war . We all want peace , we all want international friendship , we all want to give up the hateful rivalries of nations ; we must learn to plan the world internationally , we must unite or we shall perish . This is a very different thing from that emasculated standardization of life which will add cultural to political internationalism . Is it possible to be a nationalist , and at the same time an internationalist ? I believe that political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not exist without the other . It is all very well for Wells and Curry to dismiss local patriotism with a sneer about Devonshire cream or Yorkshire pudding ; but these things are small emanations of a deep-rooted instinct which we can not eliminate if we would : and which we ought not to want to eliminate . I believe that the love of one 's country , one 's language , one 's customs , one 's religion , are essential to our spiritual health . We may laugh at these things but we love them none the less . Indeed it is one of our national characteristics and one which I should be sorry to see disappear , that we laugh at what we love . This is something that a foreigner can never fathom , but it is out of such characteristics , these hard knots in our timber , that we can help to build up a united Europe and a world federation . In old days nationalism was not self-conscious because it was inevitable . When travel was slow and dangerous , when dissemination of news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get from London to York than it now takes from London to New York , each country had to fend artistically , as well as economically ,  | for itself . Now we have changed all that ; we can get our music from Germany , our painting from France , our jokes from America , and our dancing from Russia . Has this brought us peace ? Does not this colourless cosmopolitanism bring in its train wars , such as our isolated forefathers never dreamed of ? I agree that this loyalty to one 's country can only come to a full flowering when it is merged in a wider loyalty to the whole human race . But without that local loyalty there can be nothing for the wider issues to build on . I believe that all that is of value in our spiritual and cultural life springs from our own soil ; but this life can not develop and fructify except in an atmosphere of friendship and sympathy with other nations . Moreover , our national art must not be a backwater , but must take its part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In that stream we must preserve our own current . We must not merely become an indistinguishable part of the general flow . I believe , then , that political internationalism is not only compatible with cultural patriotism , but that one is an essential concomitant of the other . When the United States of Europe becomes a fact , each nation must have something to bring to the common stock of good . What we have to offer must derive essentially from our own life . It must not be a bad imitation of what other nations already do better . We should then be bad members of a world polity . I remember that soon after the First World War a distinguished British conductor toured Europe , playing British music to continental audiences . I asked him what sort of music he had played . He answered , I tried to give them something like what they were accustomed to . ' Never was a greater mistake . What he ought to have given them was something that only we could do . They probably would not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something which they could not and probably did not want to do themselves , but that if they did want it they would have to come to us for it . At this point you will probably quote Tennyson at me , and tell nIe we needs must love the highest when we see it ; or Rossini , who used to say , I know of only two kinds of music , bad and good . ' Surely , you may say , we ought to want the best music wherever it comes from . If you go into a hot-house , pick a rare , exotic flower and put it in water in your room , it may perhaps , for a short time ,  | seem better to you than the everyday rose which is growing in your garden outside the window . But in a short time the exotic will be a mere stalk , while the rose will live on , and even when it dies will be succeeded by others . Which then is the better of these two ? The answer is that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We may say that the Covent Garden Opera of the pre-war years with its array of international celebrities was in one sense better than Sadlers Wells with its overworked and underpaid band of devotees . In the long run , which is going to make us more musical ? Which is going to give the greatest impulse that is the foundation of all great art ? Do not think that I am decrying the foreign experts . We want the experts as the coping stone of our building , but even more do we want the humble practitioner as its foundation . Without the coping stone the edifice will not be complete ; without the foundation it will collapse . The problem of home-grown music has lately 1942 become acute owing to the friendly invasion of these shores by an army of distinguished German and Austrian musicians . The Germans and Austrians have a great musical tradition behind them . In some ways they are musically more developed than we , and therein lies the danger . The question is not who has the best music , but what is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great names of Bach , Beethoven , Mozart , and Brahms behind them , are apt to think that all music that counts must come from their countries . And not only the actual music itself , but the whole method and outlook of musical performance and appreciation . We must be careful that , faced with this overwhelming mass of men and material ' , we do not all become sham little Austrians or Germans . In that case either we shall make no music for ourselves at all , or such as we do make will be just a mechanical imitation of foreign models . In either case the music which we make will have no vitality of its own . It is again a case of the exotic flower in water . As long as our distinguished guests are with us we shall enjoy their art . But when they return to their own country , or when time inevitably puts an end to their activities , we shall find that we can not successfully imitate their art , and that we have lost the power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opera will illustrate these points the best . Serious opera has never flourished in this country ; largely , I believe , because it was sung in a foreign language by foreign artists , or by English artists trying to be as foreign as possible , using that strange libretto language ' which has no relation to any known tongue , Mid which they pronounce as a sort of bastard Italian . I remember the performance of a supposed English opera in the course of which the hero walked into the middle of the stage and called out , Whaa aas maa braad ? ' England is the only country in the world , except perhaps the U.S.A. , where opera is performed in a language foreign to that country . I remember when I went to Paris being puzzled by an advertisement at the opera of Le Crepuscule des Dieux . Opera , to English hearers , should be sung in English ( not libretto English ; it is this , and our sham Carusos who sing it , which would seem to justify the man who declared that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would choose to have his opera in that language . Or the lady who when offered a libretto said , We do n't want to know what the opera is about , we 've only come to hear the singing . ' Opera in a foreign tongue will only appeal to the snobs who want to hear expensive foreign artists ; or the prigs who can not bear the sound of their own language . It will not touch the people , those who are eventually going to make opera in this country . Now this is where our Austrian and German friends come in : many of them have had great experience of conducting and producing opera , and we wish to enlist their help , but they will fmd that the question of opera in English carries a lot in its train ; they can not force their production , which is suitable for the German or the Italian language , as it stands , on to English artists singing the English language . The British attitude towards both tragedy and comedy is entirely different from the Teutonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching a distinguished English singer trying conscientiously to be funny in the Teutonic manner . The hectic boisterousness which the German producer demanded was absolutely alien to the English nature whose comedy depends so much on understatement . What course are we to pursue ? Are we to take the English standard of singing and mould it to opera , or are we to force the continental style down English throats ? Or hold  | that singing , like champagne and caviar , is something that must be imported from abroad because the English climate will not support it ? Perhaps the way our distinguished visitors can help us is by becoming musically British citizens ; by getting at the heart of our culture , to see the art of music as we see it , and then to stimulate it and add to it with their own unique experience and knowledge . If , however , they propose to establish a little Europe in England ' , quite cut off from the cultural life of this country and existing for itself alone , then indeed they will have the enthusiastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture is the only one worth having , and do not recognize the intimate connexion between art and life . Indeed it is only lately that this connexion has been recognized by quite educated people in this country . A recent edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica describes art as an ornamental fringe on the edge of life , a relaxation for those who can afford it . Nowadays I think we know better ; we realize that art is not a luxury but a necessity . But do we even now realize the importance of active participation in art instead of passive submission ? Art can only thrive in an atmosphere of art . When we hear the fine flowering of Austrian or Italian music we are apt to imagine that these countries simply teem with Carusos and Kreislers . As a matter of fact you could probably hear more bad music in a day in Austria or Italy than in a week in England . But the point is that they do make music . They are not content to listen to lectures about it . What I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gustav Holst used to say that if a thing is worth doing at all it is worth doing badly . Out of all the bad music the good music will emerge . English musical history is full of the tragedy of genius withering on barren soil ? Dunstable , Purcell , Wesley , or Sullivan . Many young British composers have been ruined by abdicating their birthright in their most impressionable years . Before they knew what they wanted to achieve , before they had learned , so to speak , their own language , they went to Paris or Berlin or Vienna and came back having forgotten their own musical tongue and with only a superficial smattering of any other . My advice to young composers is ? learn your own language first , find out your own  | traditions , discover what you want to do ; then , go to Paris , Berlin , or anywhere else , rub musical shoulders with others , test your ideas against theirs , and so find out how far your art is built up four square ' . You may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' But is broad-mindedness after all such a blessing ? Is it not too often a synonym for moral cowardice and inability to make up one 's mind ? I do not want you to think that I do not welcome here all the great artists of the world . But I do so because I believe and hope that they will strengthen and stimulate our own art , and I do not want them to swamp it . In the same way I want us to perform all the great masterpieces of music ; but we must perform them according to our own lights and our own artistic needs . ( 1942  | Composing for the Films Some years ago I happened to say to the composer , Arthur Benjamin , that I should like to have a shot at writing for the films . He seemed surprised and shocked that I should wish to attempt anything which required so much skill and gained so little artistic reward . However , he mentioned my curious wish to a well-known film conductor . The result was that , one Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write some film music . When I asked how long I could have to prepare it , the answer was , Till Wednesday . ' This is one of the bad sides of writing music for films ? the time limit . Not indeed that it hurts anyone to try to write quickly , the feeling of urgency is often a stimulus ; when the hand is lazy the mind often gets lazy as well , but the composer wants to have the opportunity , when all is approaching completion , to remember emotion in tranquillity , to sit down quietly and make sure that he has achieved the mot juste at every point . That is where the time limit inhibits the final perfection of inspiration . On the other hand , film composing is a splendid discipline , and I recommend a course of it to all composition teachers whose pupils are apt to be dawdling in their ideas , or whose every bar is sacred and must not be cut or altered . When the film composer comes down to brass tacks he finds himself confronted with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds of music here . ' This means forty , not thirtynine or forty-one . The picture rolls on relentlessly like Fate . If the music is too short it will stop dead just before the culminating kiss ; if it is too long , it will still be registering intense emotion while the screen is already showing the comic man putting on his mother-inlaw 's breeches.  | A film producer would make short work of Mahler 's interminable codas or Dvorak 's five endings to each movement . I believe that film music is capable of becoming , and to a certain extent already is , a fine art , but it is applied art and a specialized art at that ; it must fit the action and dialogue ; often it becomes simply a background . Its form must depend on the form of the drama , so the composer must be prepared to write music which is capable of almost unlimited extension or compression ; it must be able to fade-out and fade-in again without loss of continuity . A composer must be prepared to face losing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and must be prepared to make a workmanlike job of it ; in fact , he must shape not only his ends , but his beginnings and his middles , in spite of the producer 's rough hewings . It may be questioned , is any art possible in these conditions ? I say , emphatically , Yes , if we go the right way to work . ' It is extraordinary how , under the pressure of necessity , a dozen or so bars in the middle of a movement are discovered to be redundant , how a fortissimo climax really ought to be a pianissimo fade-out . There are two ways of writing film music . One is that in which every action , word , gesture or incident is punctuated in sound . This requires great skill and orchestral knowledge and a vivid specialized imagination , but often leads to a mere scrappy succession of sounds of no musical value in itself . On this the question raises : should film music have any value outside its particular function ? By value I do not mean necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece , but I do believe that no artistic result can come from this complex entity , the film , unless each element , acting , photography , script , and music are each , in themselves and by themselves , intrinsically good . The other method of writing film music , which personally I favour , partly because I am quite incapable of doing the first , is to ignore the details and to intensify the spirit of the whole situation by a continuous stream of music . This stream can be modified ( often at rehearsal ! ) by points of colour superimposed on the flow . For example , your music is illustrating Columbus 's voyage and you have a sombre tune symbolizing the weariness of the voyage , the depression of the crew and the doubts of Columbus . But the producer says , I want a little bit of sunshine music for that flash on the  | waves . ' Now , do n't say , O well , the music does not provide for that ; I must take it home and write something quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send the orchestra away for five minutes , which will delight them . Then you look at the score to find out what instruments are unemployed ? say , the harp and two muted trumpets ? you write in your sunlight at the appropriate second ; you re-call the orchestra ; you then play the altered version , while the producer marvels at your skill in composing what appears to him to be an entirely new piece of music in so short a time . On the other hand , you must not be horrified if you find that a passage which you intended to portray the villain 's mad revenge has been used by the musical director to illustrate the cats being driven out of the dairy . The truth is that within limits any music can be made to fit any situation . An ingenious and sympathetic musical director can skilfully manoeuvre a musical phrase so that it exactly synchronizes with a situation which was never in the composer 's mind . I am only a novice at this art of film music and some of my more practised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience my youthful exuberance will disappear , and I shall look upon film composing not as an art but as a business . At present I still feel a morning blush which has not yet paled into the light of common day . I still believe that the film contains potentialities for the combination of all the arts such as Wagner never dreamt of . I would therefore urge those distinguished musicians who have entered into the world of the cinema ? Bax , Bliss , Walton , Benja-min , and others ? to realize their responsibility in helping to take the film out of the realm of hackwork and make it a subject worthy of a real composer . If , however , the composer is to take his side of the bargain seriously the other partners in the transaction must come out to meet him . The arts must combine from the very inception of the idea . There is a story of a millionaire who built a house and showed it to a friend when it was near completion . The friend commented on the bare and barrack-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' said the millionaire , we have n't added the architecture yet . ' This seems to be the idea of music held by too many film directors . When the photography is finished , when the dialogue and the  | barking dogs and the whistling trains and the screeching taxis have been pasted on to the sound-track ( I expect this is an entirely unscientific way of expressing it , then , thinks the director , let us have a little music to add a final frill ' . So the music only comes in when all the photography is done and the actors dispersed to their homes or to their next job . Perhaps the composer has ( unwisely from the practical point of view ) already read the script and devised music for certain situations as he has imagined them before seeing the pictures , but what can he do about it ? The photograph is already there , the timing is rigidly fixed and if the composer 's musical ideas are too long or too short they must be cut or repeated , or worse still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken , there can be no re-timing . What is the remedy for all this ? Surely the author , director , photographer , and composer should work together from the beginning . Film directors pay lip service to this idea ; they tell you that they want the ideal combination of the arts , but when all is finished one finds that much of the music has been cut out or faded down to a vague murmur , or distorted so that its own father would not know it , and this without so much as by your leave ' to the unhappy musician . I repeat then , the various elements should work together from the start . I can imagine the author showing a rough draft to the composer ; the composer would suggest places where , in his opinion , music was necessary , and the author would , of course , do the same to the composer . The composer could even sketch some of the music and if it was mutually approved of , the scenes could be timed so as to give the music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the film contains a scene in which the hero is escaping from his enemies and arrives at a shepherd 's hut in the mountains . The composer fmds he wants a long theme to establish ' the mountain scenery , but the director says , That will never do , it would hold up the action ' , and so they fight it out ; perhaps the director wins . uid the composer has to alter or modify his music . Or the director is so pleased with the composer 's tune that he risks the extra length . My point is that all this should be done before the photographs are taken . This would not prevent further modifications in the fmal stages . An outsider would probably consider this procedure obvious , but  | so far as my limited experience goes , it has never occurred as a possibility to the author , or the director , and certainly not to the composer . Again , when music is to accompany dialogue or action , surely the actors should hear the music before they start rehearsing ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point of view of timing and of emotional reaction . I need hardly say that the same give-and-take would be necessary here , that is , that the composer must be ready occasionally to modify his music to fit the action and dialogue . It is objected that this is unpractical . One could not have a symphony orchestra day after day in the studio accompanying a long drawn-out rehearsal for each scene . The expense , it is said , would be impossible . When I hear of the hundreds of thousands of pounds which are spent on a film production , it seems to be rather queer to cavil at the few extra hundreds which this would involve , but let that pass . If an orchestra is impossible , how about the pianoforte ? The trouble would be to eliminate the pianoforte sounds and substitute an orchestral equivalent which would absolutely synchronize . I am told that no method has yet been devised that can do this . I know nothing about the mechanics of the filmmaking , the skill of the whole thing fills me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if they really wished , could not devise a method ? where there 's a will there 's a way . At present , where film music is concerned there is not the will . Yet another method would be to rehearse with the music played , I presume , on the pianoforte , and then , having registered the exact timing and the exact emotional reaction of the actors to the music , to act it all over again in exactly the same way without the music . I can not help feeling that the result would be intolerably mechanical . Of these three methods the pianoforte accompaniment ( afterwards to be eliminated ) seems to be the best solution of the problem . Does it really pass the wit of those marvellous engineers of the film to devise some method by which it can be achieved ? I believe that this and many other problems could be solved by those who have had much experience , if the composer insisted . As long as music is content to be the maid-of-all-work , until the musicians rise to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day a great film will be built up on the basis of music . The music will be written first and the film devised to accompany it , or the film will be written to music already composed . Walt Disney has pointed the way in his Fantasia . But must it always be a cartoon film ? Could not the same idea be applied to the photographic film ? Can music only suggest the fantastic and grotesque creations of an artist 's pencil ? May it not also shed its light on real people ? Does what I have written sound like the uninstructed grouse of an ignorant tyro ? I hope not , indeed . I venture to believe that my very inexperience may have enabled me to see the wood where the expert can only see the trees .

NYM : The good humour is to steal at a minim 's rest . The word minim was apparently misheard by the reporters who took down the play , and they wrote minute 's ' . The eighteenthcentury wiseacres , knowing nothing of music , except as an expensive noise , failed to understand the joke implied in the word minim and stuck to the nonsensical word , minute . This reading persisted right into the nineteenth century . Why could Shakespeare make a joke about a minim 's rest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not even know the musical term ? Because , under Elizabeth , music was a living thing to old and young , rich and poor . At one end of the scale comes Morley 's pupil who was ashamed because he could not take his part in a madrigal after supper , and at the other the groundlings ' who did not misunderstand when Shakespeare called one of his most beautiful songs silly sooth , old and plain , sung by the spinsters and knitters in the sun . They knew that Shakespeare realized the beauty of their old plain ' ballads ; is he not always quoting them ? What would Dr. Johnson have said if he were told that because he had no ear for music he was fit for stratagems and spoils ? He refused to smile with the simple and feed with the poor ? Nay , my dear lady , let me smile with the wise , and feed with the rich .

This German king was at the beck and call of a landed oligarchy which grew daily in power and wealth . The sons of these country gentry were sent on the grand tour ' of Europe whence they returned laden with foreign pictures and sculpture and bringing home with them a voracious horde of trench , German , and Italian musicians who did not try to understand our art , but planted their own standards in its place . They were at one and the same time worshipped as divine beings and despised as damned French fiddlers ' ? a wholesome state of things in which a national art might flourish ! Music came to be considered a foreign luxury to be enjoyed by the rich , together with their wine and their China tea , but to practise which professionally was entirely unworthy of John Bull . Thus the divergence between art and life grew ever wider . Art became isolated in cathedral closes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not altogether a bad thing , for within these narrow confines there grew up the art of the eighteenthcentury hymn , psalm , and chant tunes ; something entirely sui cneris and within its limits often very beautiful . And what about the music of the people which had flourished exceedingly in Tudor times ? We know that Squire Western still liked Bobbing Joan ' while Sophia preferred Mr. Handel . In the end Handel won and the songs of the people were no longer sung in more prosperous circles . The peasantry , owing to the Enclosure Acts followed by the Industrial Revolution , became a depressed lass indeed ; the iron curtain descended on their activities ? but were they dumb ? Their music and their poetry were indeed ignored right into the nineteenth century by the manor house and the parsonage .

Is it possible that the same thing is happening with our music ? Long it has lain underground . The old psalmody of the parish church was destroyed in the ' fifties and ' sixties by the Oxford Movement and Hymns Ancient and Modern . The church band was superseded by the wheezy harmonium and later by the American organ ' . The folk-song ceased to be sung in its true environment after the Education Act , 187o . Why try to make your own music when it can be obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the light of English music flickered , it never quite went out . Arthur Sullivan had the makings of a unique composer ? but circumstances were too much for him . It seems fated that our musicians should be born out of due time . Purcell lived before the great period when his genius could have its full technical equipment . Wesley was tied hand and foot to the organ-stool . Sullivan also was bound by the convention of his time . He could , under happier circumstances , have written another Figaro ? but light ' music was obliged to be trivial ; serious ' music had to take on the smug solemnity of the mid-Victorian oratorio . Music which should be at once light and serious was unheard of . Perhaps the darkest hour was before the dawn . The nineteenth century saw the birth and early development of Parry , Stanford , and Elgar . They were the pioneers who led the way to the great resurgence of music here in England . What was the life-giving power which led these men to hand on the torch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composer meant rows of empty seats . Now all is changed ? why ? Because all the composers of this renaissance from Parry to Britten , different and often antagonistic as their aims are , have this in common ? that they realize that vital art must grow in its own soil and be nurtured by its own rain and sunshine . But this alone would not be enough , It takes 1,000 bad composers to make one good one , it takes 1,000 mediocre violinists to  | make one virtuoso . Some people say that art is for the few ? that may be true , but it is only from the many voices that one can pick out the few who know the password . It was not so long ago that the Encyclopaedia Britannica could define Art as an ornament on the fringe of life , a luxury for those who could afford it , and to this day The Times classifies a performance of Bach 's Passion in a church under the heading of ' entertainments ' . But the mass of the people have by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor a mere luxury , but a necessity of the spiritual if not of the physical life , an opening of those magic casements through which we can catch a glimpse of that country where ultimate reality will be found . It seems that music , not only in its vague aspects but in its very details , was an essential part of the spiritual life of the sixteenth century . It was not for nothing that both Shakespeare and Milton were skilled musicians , or that George Herbert could write : Or since all music is but three parts vied And multiplied ; O let thy blessed Spirit bear a part And make up our defects with his sweet art , and make sure that he would be understood . How different from the mere dope of Music When Soft Voices Die ' in the early nineteenth century . The Elizabethans experienced a great revival of national consciousness which expressed itself in their poetry and music . Are we experiencing a similar revival ? It is not mere accident that during the last War , when our national consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater and greater effort , the need for music became greater and greater . The time will soon be due for the next supreme composer . He will arise in that community which is best fitted to receive him . ( 1948  | Bach , the Great Bourgeois When I was a small boy I was brought up almost entirely on Handel , and especially the Handel Festival . I once heard a Bach Gavotte at a village concert and asked whether it was right to put such a name on the same programme as the great masters , and my aunt told me that Bach was quite a good composer : but of course not so good as Handel ( this being the accepted view in those days ) ; and with the strange incuriosity of a child I left it at that and made no further inquiries until I went to school at ten years old . There I was taken in hand by the music master , Mr. C. T. West , whose name I shall always hold in reverence . He soon realized that I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love ' and one day ? a momentous day for me ? he brought me a Bach Album edited by Berthold Tours . Here indeed was a revelation ; here was something undeniably belonging to no period or style , something for all time . This is where Bach differs from other composers . They , with the exception of a few outstanding Beethoven works , belong to their time , but Bach , though superficially he may speak the eighteenth-century language , belongs to no school or period . There is a tendency nowadays to put Bach in his place ' . He is labelled as Baroque ' ( whatever that may mean ) and according to the latest orders from Germany he is to be performed as period music ' in the precise periwig style . This is all part of a movement to play Bach as he wrote it ' . To do this would be impossible even if we wanted to . Our violins are played on quite a different principle ; our horns are soft and our trombones are loud . I should like to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which in Bach 's time stood for an oboe . The harpsi-  | chord , however it may sound in a small room ? and to my mind it never has a pleasant sound ? in a large concert room sounds just like the ticking of a sewing machine . We have no longer , thank Heaven , the Baroque style of organ , which we are told , with very insufficient evidence , was the kind of instrument Bach played upon . ( By the way , I see there is a movement afoot to substitute this bubble-and-squeak type of instrument for the noble diapason and soft mixtures of our cathedral organs . ) We can not perform Bach exactly as he was played in his time even if we wanted to , and the question is , do we want to ? I say emphatically , No ! Some music dies with its period , but what is really immortal endures from generation to generation . The interpretation and with it the means of interpretation differ with each generation . If the music is ephemeral it will disappear with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive it will live on through all the alterations of musical thought . A young exquisite once said to me , I do n't like Bach , he is so bourgeois ' , to which I probably answered that being bourgeois myself I considered Bach the greatest of all composers . It is Bach 's intense humanity which endears him to me and my fellow bourgeois . The proletarians ( if there were any in this country ) would be too much occupied with their wrongs , and the governing classes ' ( if indeed they existed outside the imagination of the New Statesman ) would be too much occupied in preserving their rights to have time to be human . Those members of choral societies who sing Bach perhaps have not the exquisite literary taste of our high intelligentsia . The pietism of Bach 's texts are not an offence to them even when they are translated into what the Rev. Dr. Troutbeck imagined was English . Well , the members of our choral societies are not literary experts and certain words which shock the esoteric sense of the literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literary , we are not artistic , but we are musical . But we must introduce Bach to our musical public not as a museum piece ; we must do nothing to give the slightest hint of the scholar or the antiquarian . Does this involve , for example , the substitution of a pianoforte for a harpsichord ; the doubling of the oboes with the clarinets in loud passages ; the occasional substitution  | of strings for the harpsichord in the realization ' of Bach 's figured bass ? Different circumstances require different treatment . How did Bach hear his own cantatas and passions ? He had a choir of sixteen voices , not very good according to his own account ; a very ramshackle orchestra of about the same size and also a large organ . This is what he heard , and as Sir George Dyson justly says , it is doubtful if he ever heard a decent performance of one of his cantatas . What would he have said if he could have heard the Mass or Passion sung by three hundred voices from Leeds or Huddersfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It might not be quite what he expected . He might have said : This is not what I ever hoped to hear , but it realizes and more than realizes what was in my mind . However with this enormous and splendid choir what is that wretched little orchestra of two oboes and two flutes doing . This , of course , must be altered . I see you have an instrument here called a clarinet . This would be very useful to increase the tone of your oboes , which to my mind is very thin , and to steady the occasional bubble of your trumpets . Again , where is your organ ? It is essential to fill in the gaps of my orchestra . I see that you have an organ in your hall but you tell me it ca n't be used because it is the wrong pitch . Well , you are a funny people . How do you propose to do my " Confiteor " or the opening chorus of " Fin ' Feste Burg " without an organ ? Of course you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself ? any competent musician who understands my work can do that part of it . Some of your new instruments which I see in the orchestra could be brought in to help : your nimble horns which are soft , whereas mine were loud , and your trombones which are loud , whereas mine were soft : you have changed all that and in order to keep the spirit of my music you must , perforce , modify the letter . ' Purists may object that Bach never used trombones and trumpets in the same piece of music . This is true , and for this wonderful reasons have been given couched in the best jargon of aesthetic philosophy . The real reason was discovered by Professor Sanford Terry , namely , that the same performers played both instruments ! Nowadays we have both trumpets and trombones at our disposal . May we not , in the absence of an organ , double our voice parts with trombones as Bach himself often did ? Sir Hugh Allen was  | hardly an iconoclast , but he doubled the voices with trombones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doubtless Bach would have done the same if his players had not been already occupied mounting up to high D on their trumpets . Can we not apply this principle to Bach 's string parts as well ? He had a very meagre band of strings and they were probably all double-handed  --  that is to say , they could play the violin or viola equally badly . Now in some of Bach 's arias , notably the Agnus Dei of the B minor Mass , he wanted all the available strings for that wonderful opening melody . If you look at the score you will see that the first and second violins play in unison and that the violas are silent ; this means , I have no doubt , that he made the violas change to violins for that number , leaving the inner parts to be filled in as best they could on the organ or harpsichord ; and I feel equally certain that the continuo player filled in a flowing accompaniment and not those nasty detached twangs on the harpsichord which we hear nowadays . In our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no necessity for the violas to double the violins ; therefore they sit idle , earning their guineas for nothing . To my mind , it would be justifiable to entrust the said flowing accompaniment to them . When I tried the experiment Sir Hugh Allen was slightly surprised but said , It sounded very beautiful . ' Closely connected with the problem of adaptation is the question of words . The purists in this matter can be divided into two classes ? those who say that a performance must be in the original language ; that Bach wrote for the German text and only the German text may be used , with the result of course that hardly any of the performers would be able to pronounce , or the audience understand , what is being sung ( I am speaking of course not of an audience of specialists but of the great mass of people who are now crowding to sing and hear Bach ) . The other class are those who admit that performances must be in English , but that the words must be mauled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recitative shall be altered . These people evidently have no feeling for the beauty of the Authorized Version and , rather than alter one note of Bach 's music , they will countenance such horrors as One brief hour ' as given in one of our English translations . In this case we are indeed confronted  | with a conflict of loyalties ? loyalty to Bach 's incomparable music and loyalty to the incomparable beauty of our English Authorized Version . Of course when Bach has a definite melodic passage as in his arias and ariosos his notes must come first . But in the mere narrative where his object was to fit notes to the words so as to make correct declamation of the text , surely we may alter a note or two so as to preserve our superb English Biblical language , though of course , even here , when Bach has a magnificent expressive phrase for a particular word , we must , of course , place that word under the note which expresses it . Thus we are obliged to say , Go yonder and pray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word pray ' can be under Bach 's wonderful musical illustration . This point of view naturally does not occur to the distinguished foreign musicians who come here to conduct Bach . I remember once talking on the subject to a well-known and very talented foreign conductor . He was much horrified at the slight alterations in the recitative of the Bach-Elgar edition of the Passion . When I pointed out to him that they were made so as to preserve the text of the Authorized Version which we all loved in England he replied with scorn , I should like to know who authorized it ' , and when I objected that Troutbeck 's literary style left much to be desired he only said that he believed he was a very religious man . Did Bach always mean his orchestral directions to be carried out to the letter ? For example , he scarcely ever specified what instrument is to play the continuo . I have heard the Agnus Dei from the B minor Mass accompanied by what Mr. Byard expressively calls plops ' on the harpsichord and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again , when Bach writes an obbligato and marks it oboe col violini ' does he really mean the doubling to go on all the time ? May we not suppose that at the rehearsal he told the oboe to rest for a certain number of bars ( indeed if the oboist tried to play the whole time as written he would probably burst ) ; and occasionally told the violins to be silent and let the oboe be heard alone ? I have tried this experiment with , I hope , success in the instrumental interludes of Jesu , Joy of Man 's Desiring ' . Now we must tackle the problem of what is rather pompously called realization of the continuo ' . In many of the arias and in the  | whole of the Evangelist 's recitatives all that Bach provided was the bass and the necessary figures to indicate what harmonies should be played above the bass . ( A figured bass by the way is something like the scheme which has been adopted for notation of the music for the ukelele in modern times . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty it was to improvise a full accompaniment according to the indication in the figures . It can not be made too clear that what we find in the usual pianoforte scores of the Bach recitatives is not what Bach wrote . As I have already said , what Bach wrote for his recitatives was only the bass with the necessary figures to indicate the harmonies . In the usual vocal scores of the Passion this bass is realized ' as a series of detached chords placed in the dullest part of the instrument and with hardly any variation of treatment which makes the cadences , particularly , almost intolerable . However , I hope and believe that these printed pianoforte parts are never played and , in justice to the arranger , I think they were never meant to be played . Perhaps really it would have been better in that case to print simply Bach 's bass and figures and not give simple-minded people the idea that when they play these dreary chords they are playing Bach . How , then , are we to play Bach recitatives ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his guidance did something interesting and elaborate by way of realization ' . Will it be impertinent if we also try to do something interesting and elaborate , always of course keeping well within Bach 's idiom ? In this way , I believe we should truly interpret the word continuo ' by a flowing melodic outline varying according to the nature of the narrative and the emotional content of the words . The letter killeth , but the Spirit giveth life . ' If we adhere meticulously and mechanically to the letter of Bach we shall inevitably kill the spirit . Bach 's hearers were eighteenth-century German Lutherans with minds very different from ours . They had , for example , a very personal reaction to theology ; they saw no harm in singing Mein Jesu gute Nacht ' . Our purists would have us sing ' My Jesus Now Good Night ' , but we quite rightly realize that in English this would be mere affectation . Again , these eighteenthcentury German burghers liked full value for their money and they thought nothing of sitting in church listening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music , plus a sermon . But we , with our quicker apprehension , are more easily and can not really endure the emotion of this music for so long . It is the fashion nowdays to perform Bach 's Passion in its entirety with a Bach ' luncheon party between the parts . I believe this to be a mistake . We must admit that Homer occasionally nods , and that some of the arias are not up to Bach 's high standard . It is , I believe , wrong to include these for the sake of a mechanical completeness . It is not impossible that Bach never meant them all to be played on the same occasion , but that he made a different selection from year to year . I admit there is no evidence for this ; but all the same it seems not impossible . Why should we perform Bach with all the disabilities under which he suffered any more than we perform Shakespeare in the Elizabethan pronunciation ? If by modifying the letter we kill the spirit of Bach , then he had better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other mummies . Through all the changes and chances the beauty of his music abides because his music appeals to everyone ? not only to the aesthete , the musicologist or the propagandist , but above all to Whitman 's Divine Average ' ? that great middle class from whom nearly all that is worth while in religion , painting , poetry , and music has sprung . Let me finish with one short story . The other day a messenger boy came to the door with a C.O.D . parcel . When I had paid the cash , signed along the dotted line and received his official thank you ' , he hesitated a moment and then added , When 's the Passion ? ' ( 1950 )  | My first teacher in musical theory was my aunt , Miss Wedgwood . When I was about six I wrote a pianoforte piece , four bars long , called , heaven knows why , The Robin 's Nest ' . It was shown to some musical visitors and my sister heard one of them say , Has he learnt any thoroughbass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what thoroughbass ' could be . Of course , it never occurred to us to ask . However , soon after this my aunt took me through a book which I still have , called The Child 's Introduction to Thorough Bass in Conversations of a Fortnight between a Mother and her Daughter aged Ten years old : London , printed for Baldwin Cradock and Joy , 14 , Paternoster Row , 1819 . Here is a specimen from conversation 8 : MARY : Mama , have I anything more to learn about the chord of the 7th ? MOTHER : Yes , you already know how a simple chord of the 7th is formed , but you are also to learn that there are 4 different kinds of 7th . From this I went on to Stainer 's Harmony , and when I was about eight I went in for a correspondence course organized by Edinburgh University , and , so far as I can remember , passed both the preliminary and advanced examinations . My handwriting was , at that time , considered too bad ( I am told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was allowed to dictate my exercises to my aunt . Meanwhile , I had been taught the pianoforte , which I never could play , and the violin , which was my musical salvation . I remember as if it were yesterday , when I was about , I think , seven years old walking with my mother through the streets of Eastbourne and seeing in a music shop an advertisement of violin lessons . My mother said to me , Would you like to learn the violin ? ' and I , without thinking , said , Yes . ' Accordingly , next day , a wizened old  | German called Cramer appeared on the scene and gave me my first violin lesson . I took my violin with me to a preparatory school at Rottingdean where I had lessons from a well-known Brighton teacher , Quirke . The climax of my career at Rottingdean was when I played Raff 's Cavatina ' at a school concert . Fifty years later , at one of the Three Choirs Festivals , I was suddenly moved to seize W. H. Reed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , double stops and all , while Reed vamped an accompaniment , before a discerning and enthusiastic audience . But to continue my violin career to its bitter end : at Charterhouse I joined the school orchestra and played second violin , changing later to viola . I also played in Haydn string quartets with Colonel Lewin and his musical family in the holidays , and on Sundays at school I used to go to Mr. Girdlestone , one of the masters , where with several other boys we played through Concerti Grossi by the great Italian masters . I owe a great deal to these ensemble experiences . I remember my first practical lesson in orchestration . The school band was playing the slow movement of Beethoven 's First Symphony . The violas were quite close to the one horn in the orchestra and my first lesson in orchestral texture came from hearing the holding note on the horn which accompanies the reiterated figure of the violas . I believe I should have made quite a decent fiddler , but the authorities decided that if I was to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a career and I must seek safety on the organ stool , a trade for which I was entirely unsuited ; indeed , I have the distinction of being the only pupil who entirely baffled Sir Walter Parratt , though I must add , for my own credit , that later on I passed the F.R.C.O. examination . Sir Hugh Allen always insisted that I must have bribed the examiners . One great landmark in my musical education came , as I have mentioned earlier , while I was still at my preparatory school at Rottingdean . It was decided that I was to have some pianoforte lessons from the visiting teacher , Mr. C. T. West . First he gave me the ordinary music teacher 's rubbish , Petite Valse ' and so on ; but he had the insight to perceive that I should like something better , and one day he brought me a little book which I have always considered a great treasure ? Novello 's Bach Album . Bach had never been  | part of the home curriculum ? Handel , Mozart , Haydn , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . My brother , sister , and I were encouraged to play pianoforte duets from funny old volumes containing choruses from The Messiah ' and Israel ' which I loved , and arias from Don Giovanni and Figaro which bored me , though I have to admit that we played the overture to Figaro at about minim=5o , my aunt complaining that it was the fashion to play it much too fast . Later we added Schubert 's marches and Haydn 's symphonies to our repertoire . Since those early times I have never wavered in my admiration of Haydn . I remember one problem which disturbed me in my study of him . My aunt disapproved of waltzes and thought they were vulgar . Now , the second subject of Haydn 's Eb Symphony is undoubtedly a waltz . Haydn I knew was a great composer , a waltz I knew was something vulgar ; surely a great composer could not write anything vulgar ? The problem remained unsolved . Of Bach I then knew nothing and I imagined vaguely that he was like Handel but not so good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different from anything I knew , and Bach still remains for me in a niche by himself . One episode in my career at Charterhouse must be told . I had the temerity to approach Dr. Haig Brown , the headmaster ( and headmasters were headmasters in those days , not the **40;0;TOOLONG of modern times ) , to obtain the loan of the school hall to give a concert of compositions by myself and a school friend , H. Vivian Hamilton , who afterwards became well-known as a pianist . My chief contribution to the programme was a pianoforte trio in one movement . All I remember about it is that the principal theme is distinctly reminiscent of Cesar Franck , a composer of whom I was not even aware in those days and whom I have since learned to dislike cordially . I must have got the theme from one of the French or Belgian imitators of Franck whose salon music was popular in those days . I remember that after the concert James Noon , the mathematical master , came up to me and said in that sepulchral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very good , Williams , you must go on . ' I treasured this as one of the few words of encouragement I ever received in my life !  | On leaving Charterhouse in 1890 I went direct to the R.C.M. , but during the intervening summer holidays a very important thing happened to me . I went to Munich and heard my first Wagner opera . We found that Die Walkure was down for that evening . The opera , we were told , would start at 7 , so at 6 o'clock we sat down to have a preliminary meal . Hardly had we started when the waiter rushed in ? he had made a mistake , on a Wagner Abend the opera started at 6 . The rest decided for dinner , but I , like the hero of a novel , left my food untasted ' and rushed off to the Opera House . I arrived just in time to hear that wonderful passage for strings when Sieglinde offers Siegmund the cup . This was my first introduction to later Wagner , but I experienced no surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all before . There was a feeling of recognition as of meeting an old friend which comes to us all in the face of great artistic experiences . I had the same experience when I first heard an English folk-song , when I first saw Michael Angelo 's Day and Night , when I suddenly came upon Stonehenge , or had my first sight of New York City ? the intuition that I had been there already . That September I entered as a student at the R.C.M. and was determined , if possible , to study composition under Parry . I had first heard of Parry some years before , when I was still a schoolboy . I remember my cousin , Stephen Massingberd , coming into the room full of that new book Studies of Great Composers . This man , Parry , ' he said , declares that a composer must write music as his musical conscience demands . ' This was quite a new idea to me , the loyalty of the artist to his art . Soon after that I got to know some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember , even as a boy , my brother saying to me that there was something , to his mind , peculiarly English about his music . So I was quite prepared to join with the other young students of the R.C.M. in worshipping at that shrine , and I think I can truly say that I have never been disloyal to it . Perhaps I can no longer , owing to the weakening digestion of old age , swallow Parry 's music whole as I did then ; but I still thrill to the magnificence of Job ' and De Profundis ' , and I hereby solemnly declare , keeping steadily in view the works of Byrd , Purcell , and Elgar , that Blest Pair of Sirens ' is my favourite piece of music written by an Englishman .  | By a wise ruling of the College , which I fear no longer obtains , to one was allowed to study composition until he had passed Grade 5 in harmony . So for two terms I did my theoretical work with Dr. F. E. Gladstone . Under his guidance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a discipline for which I have ever since been grateful . After two terms I passed my Grade 5 harmony and was allowed to become a pupil of Parry . I will not try to describe what this experience meant to a boy . I was very elementary at the time . I blush with shame now when I think of the horrible little songs and anthems which I presented for his criticism . Parry 's great watchword was characteristic ' . He was always trying to discover the character revealed in even the weakest of his students ' compositions . Before telling the following story I ought to explain that Parry , not content with the official lesson , used to keep his pupils ' compositions to look at during the week . One day , through pure carelessness , I had written out a scale passage with one note repeated and then a gap ? ( i.e. , CDEFGGBC instead of CDEFGABC ) . Parry said , I have been looking at this passage for a long time to discover whether it is just a mistake or whether you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those days , even more so than now . Parry could hardly believe that I knew so little music . One day he was talking to me about the wonderful climax in the development of the Appassionata ' Sonata . Suddenly he realized that I did not know it , so he sat down at the pianoforte and played it through to me . There were showers of wrong notes , but in spite of that it was the finest performance that I have heard . So I was told to study more Beethoven , especially the posthumous quartets , as a religious exercise ' . At that time I hated Beethoven . I was suffering from an overdose of Gounod , and I could not understand why the tune in the finale of the Eroica ' Symphony was good music , while the Judex ' From Mors et Vita was bad music . ( I was only eighteen , please teacher . ) To this day the Beethoven idiom repels me , but I hope have at last learnt to see the greatness that lies behind the idiom that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an occasional weakness behind the Bach idiom which I love . Parry was very generous in lending scores to his pupils . This was  | long before the days of miniature scores and gramophone records . I borrowed Siegfried and Tristan ' and Brahms 's Requiem , and for some time after , my so-called compositions consisted entirely of variations of a passage near the beginning of that work . I remember one day when I came in for my lesson I found a fellow student , Richard Walthew , borrowing the score of the Prelude to Parsifal . Parry condemned it as the weakest of the Wagner preludes ? ' mere scene painting ' was , I think , his description of it . He was always very insistent on the importance of form as opposed to colour . He had an almost moral abhorrence of mere luscious sound . It has been said that Parry 's own orchestration was bad ; the truth is , I think , that he occasionally went too far in his deliberate eschewal of mere orchestral effect . Years after this I was sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Variations ' with its curious spiky sound . I said , I suppose many people would call this bad orchestration ; I do not find it so . ' Elgar turned on me almost fiercely : Of course it 's not bad orchestration , the music could have been scored in no other way . ' Parry 's criticism was constructive . He was not merely content to point out faults , but would prescribe the remedy . The last two bars of my early part song The Willow Song ' were almost certainly composed by Parry . Parry once said to me , Write choral music as befits an Englishman and a democrat . ' We pupils of Parry have , if we have been wise , inherited from Parry the great English choral tradition which Tallis passed on to Byrd , Byrd to Gibbons , Gibbons to Purcell , Purcell to Battishill and Greene , and they in their turn through the Wesleys to Parry . He has passed on the torch to us and it is our duty to keep it alight . I have already mentioned Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly ever meet now I hope the friendship still subsists . This , however , is not a record of friendships but of musical influences , and I pick out Walthew 's name among friends of that period because I learnt much from him . I used occasionally to go to his house at Highbury and play duets with him , or rather , he played and I stumbled behind him as best I could . In this way I learnt to know a lot of music including , I remember , Stanford 's Footnote  | Irish ' Symphony . In those days , before the gramophone and the wireless and the miniature score , the pianoforte duet was the only way , unless you were an orchestral player , of getting to know orchestral music , and one really got to know it from the inside , not in the superficial way of lazily listening to a gramophone record . One day Walthew , who had a holy horror of anything high falutin in art , insisted on taking me to hear Carmen . By that time I had quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prig . Bach , Beethoven ( ex-officio ) , Brahms , and Wagner were the only composers worth considering , so I went to Carmen prepared to scoff , but Walthew won the day and I remained to pray . It must have been about the same time that I had another salutary disturbance of my musical prejudices : I heard Verdi 's Requiem for the first time . At first I was properly shocked by the frank sentimentalism and sensationalism of the music . I remember being particularly horrified at the drop of a semitone on the word Dona ' . Was not this the purest village organist ' ? But in a very few minutes the music possessed me . I realized that here was a composer who could do all the things which I with my youthful pedantry thought wrong , indeed , would be unbearable in a lesser man ; music which was sentimental , theatrical , occasionally even cheap , and yet was an overpowering masterpiece . That day I learnt that there is nothing in itself that is common or unclean ' , indeed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the well-worn tag , To thine own self be true . ' In 1892 I went to Cambridge where I had lessons from Charles Wood in preparation for the Mus.Bac. degree . Charles Wood was the finest technical instructor I have ever known . I do not say necessarily the greatest teacher . I do not think he had the gift of inspiring enthusiasm or of leading to the higher planes of musical thought . Indeed , he was rather prone to laugh at artistic ideals and would lead one to suppose that composing music was a trick anyone might learn if he took the trouble . But for the craft of composition he was unrivalled , and he managed to teach me enough to pull me through my Mus.Bac . I also had organ lessons from Alan Gray . Our friendship survived his despair at my playing , and I became quite expert at managing the stops at his voluntaries and organ recitals .  | In the year 1892 there also came to Cambridge , as organ scholar , an undergraduate rather older than the rest , H. P. Allen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to the music of Brahms . Allen at once took over the amateur University Musical Club , shook them out of their complacency and made them rehearse such things as the Schumann and Brahms pianoforte quintets and Schubert 's string quintet . I got much musical instruction in listening to the rehearsal of these works which I came to know nearly by heart . Allen also gave me an opportunity of hearing , for the first time , a semi-public performance of a composition of my own , a quartet for men 's voices . At the first performance the second tenor got a bar out and remained so nearly to the end . Allen organized an encore and it was done all over again , this time correctly . The audience disliked it the second time even more than the first . This may seem a small episode but it was my first experience of an essential and salutary , though unpleasant form of composition lesson , a performance in public , something quite different from a private rehearsal . Allen did me the same service , though on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea Symphony had had a very doubtful reception at the Leeds Festival he at once arranged for performances at Oxford and in London , though he confessed to me afterwards that he was rather frightened about it . While I was at Cambridge I conducted a small choral society , which met on Sundays to sing Schubert 's Masses . If a composer can not play in an orchestra or sing in a choir the next best thing he can do in self-education is to try his hand at conducting and really find out what the performers are up against . The only way to learn to conduct is to try it on the dog ' . This is much better than any amount of class teaching , about which I have grave doubts . According to Wagner , the duty of the conductor is to give the proper tempo to the orchestra . Elgar said , When I conduct I let the orchestra play . ' A good orchestra will play well if the conductor will let them , and they play no better because he makes funny faces at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they fail to come in altogether if they do n't get the right grimace . ) The two best conducting lessons I ever had were from my old friend Isidore Schwiller , the violinist , who taught me how to start an orchestra on an upbeat , and from  | Mr. Henderson , the famous timpanist of the L.S.O. of old days , who said to me , You give us a good square 4 in the bar and we 'll do the rest . ' To which I may add Stanford 's witty saying , A conductor need never be nervous , he ca n't make any wrong notes . ' After Cambridge I went back to the R.C.M. Parry was by this time Director , so I went for lessons to Stanford . Stanford was a great teacher , but I believe I was unteachable . I made the great mistake of trying to fight my teacher . The way to get the best out of instruction is to put oneself entirely in the hands of one 's instructor , and try to find out all about his method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a secret eppur si muove ' up one 's sleeve . Young students are much too obsessed with the idea of expressing their personalities . In the merest harmony exercises they insist on keeping all their clumsy progressions because that is what they felt ' , forgetting that the art can not mature unless the craft matures alongside with it . The details of my work annoyed Stanford so much that we seldom arrived at the broader issues and the lesson usually started with a conversation on these lines : Damnably ugly , my boy , why do you write such things ? ' Because I like them . ' But you ca n't like them , they 're not music . " l should n't write them if I did n't like them . ' So the argument went on and there was no time left for any constructive criticism . Stanford never displayed great enthusiasm for my work . But his deeds were better than his words , and later on he introduced my work to the Leeds Festival , thus giving me my first opportunity of a performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , what one really gets out of lessons with a great man can not be computed in terms of what he said to you or what you did for him , but in terms of the intangible contact with his mind and character . With Stanford I always felt I was in the presence of a lovable , powerful , and enthralling mind . This helped me more than any amount of technical instruction . The benefit that one obtains from an academy or college is not so much from one 's official teachers as from one 's fellow students . I was lucky in my companions in those days . Other students at the College were Dunhill , Ireland , Howard Jones , Fritz Hart , and  | Gustav Holst . We used to meet in a little teashop in Kensington and discuss every subject under the sun from the lowest note of the double bassoon to the philosophy of Jude the Obscure . I learnt more from these conversations than from any amount of formal teaching , but I felt at a certain disadvantage with these companions : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amateur . I have struggled all my life to conquer amateurish technique and now that perhaps I have mastered it , it seems too late to make any use of it . Curiously , however , as regards orchestral texture , when I hear my early works , written when my knowledge was still all out of books and I had to sit for an hour wondering what to do with the 2nd clarinet in a loud tutti , my orchestration seems fuller and richer than nowadays when my writing is backed by practical experience . And here I should like to mention the names of two men who have helped me in my orchestral work . Cecil Forsyth before he went to America vetted ' many of my scores , giving out from his incomparable store of knowledge obtained straight from the horse 's nosebag ' . Gordon Jacob is the other name . He was at one time nominally my pupil , though there was nothing I could teach him which he did not know better than I , at all events in the matter of technique . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orchestration , as indeed I would gladly do in any branch of the composer 's art . In 1895 I was appointed to my first and last organ post , at St. Barnabas , South Lambeth . As I have already said , I never could play the organ , but this appointment gave me an insight into good and bad church music which stood me in good stead later on . I also had to train the choir and give organ recitals and accompany the services , which gave me some knowledge of music from the performer 's point of view . I also founded a choral society and an orchestral society , both of them pretty bad , but we managed once to do a Bach Cantata and I obtained some of that practical knowledge of music which is so essential to a composer 's make-up . Composers who think that they will achieve their aim by ranging apart and living the life beautiful make the great mistake of their lives . Wagner could never have written Tristan ' and Meistersinger if he had not had those years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted that kapellmeistership in  | that small German town whose name I forget . Intimate acquaintance with the executive side of music in orchestra , chorus , and opera made even Mahler into a very tolerable imitation of a composer . In 1897 I decided to have a few months ' study and experience abroad . Stanford wanted me to go to Italy and hear opera at the Scala . He thought I was too Teuton already . He did not want me to take definite lessons with anyone . But I disregarded his advice and went to Berlin . My reason for this choice , I believe , was the extraordinary one that Berlin was the only town at that time where they performed the Ring without cuts ! I had an introduction to Herzogenberg , who looked at my work and said it reminded him of Mascagni , and advised me to study with Max Bruch . It is difficult to say what it is one learns from a teacher . I only know that I worked hard and enthusiastically and that Max Bruch encouraged me , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupils now I always try to remember the value of encouragement . Sometimes a callow youth appears who may be a fool or may be a genius , and I would rather be guilty of encouraging a fool than of discouraging a genius . A fool , after all , may find his own salvation in artistic self-expression even though it means nothing to anyone else , and as to the genius , perhaps one may by analogy quote Lord Chesterfield , If it 's fine take an umbrella ; if it 's raining , please yourself . ' When I was under Stanford I used to vex him much with my flattened sevenths . He tried to prove to me that the flat leading note was pure theory and that all folk-songs descended on to the tonic , but I felt in my bones that he was wrong , though it was only later , when I heard traditional singers , that I was able to prove my point to my own satisfaction . Max Bruch was equally worried by this idiosyncracy of mine : he said , ' Sie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also warned me against writing Augenmusik ' as opposed to Ohren-musik ' . This warning was wasted on me as I habitually and unashamedly use the pianoforte when composing . ( I suppose this would be considered part of my amateurishness . ) I heard all the music I could when I was in Berlin , especially operas . Among them were Lortzing 's Undine and Meyerbeer 's Robert le Diable . I also remember beautiful performances of Bach Cantatas at the Sing-Akademie . The Joachim and Halir quartets  | were at their zenith and there was a memorable performance at the Hoch-Schule of the Brahms Double Concerto played as a pianoforte trio by Joachim , Hausman , and Barth . When I came back to London I soon left my organist post and settled down to try and learn how to compose , not by studying but by doing . However , I still felt the need of instruction , and in about the year 1900 I took my courage in both hands and wrote to Elgar asking him to give me lessons , especially in orchestration . I received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too busy to give me lessons but suggesting that I should become a pupil of Professor Bantock . I did not adopt his suggestion which was perhaps a mistake , as what Bantock did not know about the orchestra is not worth knowing . But though Elgar would not teach me personally he could not help teaching me through his music . I spent several hours at the British Museum studying the full scores of the Variations and Gerontius . The results are obvious in the opening pages of the finale of my Sea Symphony and I have discovered lately that I owe a good deal in this work to an early work of Hoist 's The Mystic Trumpeter . Hoist used also to say that he cribbed from me , though I never perceived it . I do not think that composers ever know when they are being cribbed from . Cribbing is , to my mind , a legitimate and praiseworthy practice , but one ought to know where one has cribbed . I expect that Schubert knew that he cribbed Death and the Maiden ' from Beethoven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had cribbed the Nibelungen ' theme from Schubert 's D minor quartet and the Rhine ' theme from Mendelssohn 's Melusine . Deliberate cribbing is all right and the funny thing is that what is most deliberately cribbed sounds the most original , but the more subtle , unconscious cribbing is , I admit , dangerous . I was quite unconscious that I had cribbed from La Mer in the introduction to my London Symphony until Constant Lambert horrified me by calling my attention to it . A strange episode occurred about this time which , though it had no direct bearing on my musical education , must be related here . I burst in on the privacy of Delius , who happened to be in London at the time , and insisted on playing through the whole of my Sea Symphony to him . Poor fellow ! How he must have hated it . But  | he was very courteous and contented himself with saying , Vraiment it n'est pas mesquin . ' In 1900 I first met Cecil Sharp . He had not then shaken musical England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imbibe folk-song from Sharp , and when I first started collecting , in 1903 , and began boring my friends with my finds I left Sharp out of the list because I thought he would not be interested . I must have made my first contact with English folk-songs when I was a boy in the ' eighties , through Stainer and Bramley 's Christmas Carols New and Old . I remember clearly my reaction to the tune of the Cherry Tree Carol ' which was more than simple admiration for a fine tune , though I did not then naturally realize the implications involved in that sense of intimacy . This sense came upon me more strongly in 1893 when I first discovered Dives and Lazarus ' in English County Songs . Here , as before with Wagner , I had that sense of recognition ? ' here 's something which I have known all my life ? only I did n't know it ! ' There has been a lot of cheap wit expended on folk-song ' composers . The matter seems to boil down to two accusations : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folk-song material . This is really nothing more than the old complaint of the vested interests who are annoyed when anyone drinks a glass of pure water which he can get free , rather than a glass of beer which will bring profit to the company . This appears to involve a moral rather than an artistic question ; from the point of view of musical experience it seems to me that so long as good music is made it matters very little how it is made or who makes it . If a composer can , by tapping the sources hidden in folk-song , make beautiful music , he will be disloyal to his art if he does not make full use of such an avenue of beauty . The second accusation is made by people who affect to scorn what is folky ' because it does not come within the ken of their airless smuggeries , because it does not require any highly-paid teachers to inculcate it , or the purchase of text-books with a corresponding royalty to the author . It is really a case of the vested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The object of art is to stretch out to the ultimate realities through the medium of beauty . The  | duty of the composer is to find the mot juste . It does not matter if this word has been said a thousand times before as long as it is the right thing to say at that moment . If it is not the right thing to say , however unheard of it may be , it is of no artistic value . Music which is unoriginal is so , not simply because it has been said before , but because the composer has not taken the trouble to make sure that this was the right thing to say at the right moment . I have never had any conscience about cribbing . I cribbed Satan 's dance in Job deliberately from the Scherzo of Beethoven 's last quartet ; the opening of my F minor Symphony deliberately from the finale of the Ninth Symphony , and the last two bars of the Scherzo to my Sea Symphony from the Mass in D. ( I expect Beethoven knew that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one of Cramer 's pianoforte studies . ) It is said that once when Wagner was rehearsing Meistersinger he stopped in the middle of that rather commonplace theme in the third act and said , Gentlemen , does not that come out of the Merry Wives ? ' My intercourse with Cecil Sharp crystallized and confirmed what I already vaguely felt about folk-song and its relationship to the composer 's art . With Sharp it was a case of Under which King , Bezonian ? Speak , or die . ' You had to be . either pro folk-song or anti folk-song and I came down heavily on the folk-song side . In 1904 I undertook to edit the music of a hymn-book . This meant two years with no original ' work except a few hymn-tunes . I wondered then if I were wasting my time ' . The years were passing and I was adding nothing to the sum of musical invention . But I know now that two years of close association with some of the best ( as well as some of the worst ) tunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of sonatas and fugues . As I have already said , I have always found it difficult to study . I have learnt almost entirely what I have learnt by trying it on the dog . Gustav Holst once said to me years ago , We ought to be writing now what will enable us to write well later on . ' This is a precept I find very difficult to observe . Young composers are apt to think that what they have written is what the world has been waiting for come at last . This is an intelligible and healthy state of mind , but they are also apt to think that it is now or never ' and  | that this is the last as well as the greatest work they are going to write ; and it is this attitude of mind which prevents so many students from learning to compose . In 1908 I came to the conclusion that I was lumpy and stodgy ; had come to a dead-end and that a little French polish would be of use to me . So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was much puzzled at our first interview . When I had shown him some of my work he said that , for my first lesson , I had better ecrire un petit menuet clans le style de Mozart ' . I saw at once that it was time to act promptly , so I said in my best French : Look here , I have given up my time , my work , my friends , and my career to come here and learn from you , and I am not going to write a " petit menuet dans le style de Mozart " . ' After that we became great friends and I learnt much from him . For example , that the heavy contrapuntal Teutonic manner was not necessary ; complexe , mais pas complique ' , was his motto . He showed me how to orchestrate in points of colour rather than in lines . It was an invigorating experience to find all artistic problems looked at from what was to me an entirely new angle . Brahms and Tchaikovsky he lumped together as tout les @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fait Mendelssohn ' ; his own music was tout a fait simple , rien que Mozart ' . He was against development for its own sake ? one should only develop for the sake of arriving at something better . He used to say there was an implied melodic outline in all vital music and instanced the opening of the C minor Symphony as an example of a tune which was not stated but was implicit . He was horrified that I had no pianoforte in the little hotel where I worked . Sans le piano on ne petit pas inventer des nouvelles harmonies . ' I practised chiefly orchestration with him . I used to score some of his own pianoforte music and bits of Rimsky and Borodin , to whom he introduced me for the first time . After three months I came home with a bad attack of French fever and wrote a string quartet which caused a friend to say that I must have been having tea with Debussy , and a song cycle with several atmospheric effects , but I did not succumb to the temptation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid me the compliment of telling me that I was the only pupil who n'ecrit pas de ma musique ' . The fact is  | that I could not have written Ravel 's music even if I had wanted to . I am quite incapable , even with the pianoforte , of inventing his nouvelles harmonies ' . I sometimes wish that I could think of the strange chords of my old friend , Arnold But . I hope I am not like the fox without the tail , but I feel content to provide good plain cooking and hope that the proof of the pudding will be in the eating . My French fever soon subsided but left my musical metabolism , on the whole , healthier . Another potent musical influence was S. P. Waddington.2 His is one of the best informed minds on all subjects that I have ever met , one of those people in the presence of whom it is impossible to be mean or petty . He never would give me formal lessons , but he often looked at my work and pronounced sound judgements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met and as I could not play at all myself his playing was often the first occasion I really heard my work . His power of deciphering a manuscript score was almost uncanny . If the manuscript was too illegible he would guess and invariably guessed right . With this power of sight-reading went that of immediately spotting weak moments and redundant bars . He was a severe critic ? ' You try to run before you can walk , ' he once said to me ; this was perfectly true ; I had not sufficient patience or application to study . I have learnt by trial and error , I have drawers full of these errors ; attempts to run with a fatal stumble almost every other bar . But one bit of study I did undertake . One summer I retired for a month to a Yorkshire farmhouse with several classical scores and the themes of my own compositions ' . These themes I proceeded to treat and develop according to my classical models , choosing of course themes which more or less corresponded in structure . I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my pupils . ( I believe Charles Wood used much the same method . ) The difficulty is that if the pupils invent ad hoc themes they are so colourless that they are incapable of development and they steadily refuse to make use of themes that they have already composed as being too sacrosanct for such base purposes . The model I most frequently use is the slow movement of Beethoven 's Sonata , Op. z No. 2 . It has so many points of subtle Footnote  | structure and development which only a close bar-by-bar analysis reveals . It was in the early years of this century that I first met George Butterworth . I think it was I who introduced him to folk-song . This was his salvation ; his music up to then had showed great promise , but was much overshadowed by Brahms and Schumann . To him , as to me , the folk-song was not an inhibiting but a liberating influence ; it certainly helped Butterworth to realize himself and to cast off the fetters of Teutonism . If I helped Butterworth , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day when he said in his gruff , abrupt manner : You know , you ought to write a symphony . ' I answered , if I remember aright , that I never had written a symphony and never intended to . This was not strictly true , for I had in earlier years sketched three movements of one symphony and the first movement of another , all now happily lost . I suppose that Butterworth 's words stung nie and , anyhow , I looked out some sketches I had made for what I believe was going to have been a symphonic poem ( ! ) about London and decided to throw it into symphonic form . Butterworth assiduously saw me through my trouble and when the original full score was lost , helped to make a new one from the band parts . The greatest influence on my music is one about which I feel I can write least . I remember my first meeting with Gustav Holst in 1895 very vividly . He quoted something from Sheridan 's The Critic . How soon we started our Field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been soon . On these occasions we would devote a whole day or at least an afternoon to examining each other 's compositions . As I say , these orgies must have started early and they continued to the end , that is to say , for nearly forty years . I think he showed all he wrote to me and I nearly all I wrote to him . I say nearly all ' advisedly , because sometimes I could not face the absolute integrity of his vision and I hid some of my worst crimes from him . I regret now that I did not face even his disapproval . Without him and Waddington to criticize me I sometimes feel lost : they both had the power and the will to give all they had . Hoist would spend hours bringing his mastery , his keen vision , and his feeling for clear texture to bear on my work especially in those clumsy places where I was continually getting into holes and  | could not find the way out . He would not rest till he had found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one which my obstinacy would accept . This was all the more wonderful because Holst , I know , found it difficult to appreciate the amateurish attitude of mind ; his absolute sureness of purpose inclined him to be unsympathetic to the vacillations of human nature . This is why , for example , I never showed him my comic opera , because he never would have been able to understand how I could at the same time consider it trivial and yet want to write it . I should like to place on record all that he did for me when I wrote Job . I should be alarmed to say how many Field Days ' we spent over it . Then he came to all the orchestral rehearsals , including a special journey to Norwich , and fmally , he insisted on the Camargo Society performing it . Thus I owe the life of Job to Holst , just as I owe the life of the Sea Symphony to Stanford and Allen . I remember after the first orchestral rehearsal of Job his almost going on his knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which my inferiority complex had led me to overload the score . Overscoring has always been one of my vices , and it arises , I am convinced , from the fact that I am not always sure enough of myself and have not the courage of my convictions and that I must hide my nakedness with an apron of orchestration . Holst 's orchestra could be naked and unashamed. ( 1950 )  | Charles Villiers Stanford It is an honour and a pleasure to be given the opportunity to write about my teacher , Charles Villiers Stanford , the centenary of whose birth we celebrate this year . Stanford was a great composer , a great teacher , a skilled conductor , and as befits a true Irishman , a lovable , quarrelsome , and generous man . He has written some of the most beautiful music that has come from these islands . He realized that all art which is worth while must spring from its own soil . He made an exhaustive study of his own Irish folk music ; some of his arrangements , notably those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father O'Flynn ' , are household words . Stanford dedicated his arrangements to Brahms , and presumably sent him a copy . Now the last movement of Brahms 's pianoforte quintet contains a phrase out of one of these Irish melodies . . . . I am not sure enough of my dates to say whether the egg or the hen came first , but the coincidence is striking . Of course in Stanford 's enormous output there is bound to be a certain amount of dull music ; but , after all , so there is in Beethoven and Bach . At times his very facility led him astray . He could , at will , use the technique of any composer and often use it better than the original , as in The Middle Watch ' , where he beats Delius at his own game . Sometimes he could not resist adding a clever touch which marred the purity of his inspiration , as in the sophisticated repetition of the words lead the line ' at the end of the otherwise beautiful song Sailing at Dawn ' . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know much about Stanford , and not having had the advantage of his teaching are inclined to ignore what he did and what he taught . But I believe that he will return again . With the next generation the inevitable reaction will  | set in and Stanford will come into his own . His smaller works are still known and loved by our choral societies , and I can not but believe that such splendid music as the Stabat Mater , Requiem , and Songs of the Fleet will not strike home as soon as opportunity is given to hear them . It is up to our concert societies , in this centenary year , to give us these works as well as the Irish ' Symphony and Rhapsodies and the many fine songs . In any continental country the centenary of a composer of Stanford 's calibre would have been celebrated in every opera house in the country . Covent Garden and Sadlers Wells can not even give us an opportunity of hearing such splendid works with all the certainty of popularity as Much Ado and Shamus O'Brien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones of Norma and Sanson et Dalilah . Many of Stanford 's songs were written for that fine but very individual singer , Plunket Greene . It is difficult , therefore , to capture their quality , but the printed line remains for any singer who will take the trouble to read the old spirit into the notes . The belittling of Stanford 's work was encouraged by one who ought to have known better . The late Bernard Shaw , in the first number of Music and Letters , used Elgar as a stick to beat what he called the Academic clique ' , forgetting ? or pretending to forget ? that it was the acknowledged head of this clique ' , Hubert Parry , who was instrumental in obtaining the first performance of Elgar 's Variations . Shaw was rather proud of having called Stanford a gentleman amateur ' since he repeated the expression more than once . Apparently the word gentleman ' was to Shaw a term of abuse , and as to amateur ' , who could have been more professional in his methods than Stanford ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an occasional snare to him . Stanford had none of the clumsiness of his contemporaries . Though a great admirer of Brahms , he did not imitate his awkward execution . Stanford 's orchestration , though perhaps unadventurous , is a model of clarity : every stroke tells . It was the fashion , as I have said , among a certain class of journalists about fifty years ago to describe Parry , Stanford , and others who ruled at the Royal College of Music as academic ' , which apparently meant that they founded the emotion of their music on knowledge and not on mere sensation . To these critics , admiration of Brahms was equivalent to dry  | as dust pedantry . If they are still alive they must feel rather foolish when they see Brahms filling the house at a Promenade Concert . Stanford was a great teacher , and like all great teachers he was narrow minded . A broad-minded teacher is useless . To say that he was strict was to put it mildly . Everything he disapproved of had no quarter . It was damnably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once , when I was his pupil , I showed him what I considered was a world-shaking masterpiece ; he looked at it and then said curtly : All rot , my boy . ' He was quite right . It was . But it took me some time to discover it . The work is now , happily , lost . The only way to get good out of a teacher is to divest yourself entirely of your own personality and do what your teacher wants ; only in that way can you get any good out of him . I was hopelessly obstinate . In order to secure a lighter touch in my work he once told me to write a waltz . At that time I was obsessed with the modes . I wrote him a modal waltz ! Stanford as a conductor had no truck with the temperamental orchestral director ; his object was to present faithfully what the composer intended . For that reason the silly journalists who labelled him academic ' complained that he lacked imaginative fancy . Against this let me set the opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finest interpreter of Brahms that he had ever heard . Stanford 's misunderstanding with Elgar was unfortunate for both men , but in spite of this , in spite of the fact that he was temperamentally allergic to Gerontius , he urged , though in vain , that it be performed in Leeds . He was also instrumental in obtaining for his supposed enemy an honorary Doctorate at Cambridge University . Stanford 's career , after his childhood and youth in Dublin , may be divided into two periods . The first dates from his appointment as organist at Trinity , College Cambridge , and afterwards as Professor in the University ; that was in the ' seventies when critics were still talking about the unhealthy influence of Wagner and Brahms ' . Stanford , fresh from Leipzig , astonished his audiences by playing the Overture to Die Meistersinger from the full score on the organ . It was this I suppose that made the Master of Trinity introduce him to a friend as Mr. Stanford , whose playing always charms us , and  | occasionally astonishes ; and I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Stanford 's second period begins when he left Cambridge , about 1893 , and lived in London . He was already conductor of the London Bach Choir , and later became conductor of the Leeds Festival : still continuing his immense output of music , often inspired , sometimes less inspired , but keeping always within the bounds of classical beauty . An artist can not always control his inspiration , but Stanford saw to it that his tools were bright and sharp and fashioned of tempered steel . His music is educated music , founded on the great traditions by one who was determined to uphold the nobility of his art . ( 1952 )  | The Mass in B Minor in English : A Programme Note The text of Bach 's Mass in B minor to be sung tonight is an attempt to adapt the words of the English Liturgy to Bach 's music . Why is such an adaptation desirable ? To many , the Latin text has connotations which are repugnant : again , as a choral singer once said to me , We like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what they can pronounce . When Latin has to be represented phonetically by such hideous gibberish as Kwee prohptair note hoh-mee-nace ' , as given in a well-known book on choral singing , surely it is time something was done . A third , to my mind , cogent reason for this adaptation is that it will enable this great music to be sung at Anglican services . The task has been beset with pitfalls ; it would indeed have been comparatively easy to have made a translation into the most approved libretto English ' which would have fitted the music like a glove ? e.g. Et resurrexit tertia die secundum scripturas ' might have become , The third bright morn saw his arising as prophets told of eld ' . Nor is the English text necessarily a translation ; e.g. hominibus bonae voluntatis ' becomes Goodwill towards men ' . The English have a very proper traditional reverence for the incomparable language of their liturgy , and any distortion of this would , I believe , cause offence to many , as have similar distortions of the English Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seems , therefore , worth while occasionally to alter a crotchet into two quavers , to re-articulate a tied note , or even ( occasionally ) to add a note , or ( very occasionally ) to omit one , for  | the sake of keeping the Prayer Book text unaltered . My principles have generally been as follows : z . When Bach attaches a particular word to a particular group of notes for expressive purposes , every attempt has been made to keep that marriage intact ; where that is impossible , a word with a similar emotional connotation has been used ? e.g. , in the Credo ( Novello , page 96 , line 1 ; Peters , page 79 , line 3 , soprano ) , where Credo ' is represented by One God ' . Similarly in the Dona Nobis I have represented Pacem ' by Grant us ' , the vowel sounds and the emotional connotation are the same and Peace ' would have been very awkward . In many cases , however , the connexion between word and note is obviously fortuitous ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syllabic rather than the emotional connexion , e.g. , in the Gloria ( Novello , page 39 , line r ; Peters , page 32 , line 2 , soprano ) . Here it must be admitted that the Pax , pax ' of Bach is rather a mouthful , and Peace , peace ' would be worse ; so I have substituted Good will ' . 2 . The Latin language abounds in feminine endings while the ends of most English sentences are masculine ; e.g. , how is Gloria in excelsis Deo ' to be fitted to Glory be to God on high ' ? In this case ( Novello , p. 29 , line 5 ; Peters , p. 26 , line 5 , soprano ) , I have fitted the complete sentence to the beginning of the musical phrase and repeated the word Glory ' for Deo ' . The effect is perhaps rhetorical , but I hope not worse for that . ' 3 . So far as possible the note values have been kept intact . Occasionally it has been necessary to substitute two crotchets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note has been re-articulated and , as already mentioned , I have been obliged in a few cases to add notes , and in a very few to omit them . 4 . Bach repeated the words of his text several times so as to expand each paragraph into a long musical movement . I have been careful to give the text complete at the first statement , but later on in the movement to use only such words as are suitable . The locus classicus of this procedure , and also the most thorny problem I Footnote  | ave had to solve , comes in the Quoniam ( No. io ) and Cum Sancto ( No. ii ) . It was a convention in Bach 's time to write a fugue for the Cum Sancto . Bach , who never defied convention , but used it for his own great purposes , obeyed the convention here : but in England we have no such convention , and it would sound rather absurd to sing the most jubilant music in the world to with the Holy Ghost , in the glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when setting these words , surely had in his mind not any ecclesiastical dogma , but an expression of the Glory of God the Father ' . Therefore I feel justified in leaving out any extraneous words in this chorus . Nevertheless , by my rules I was obliged to fit the complete sentence in somewhere . Why not at the end of the Quoniam ? Here the word altissimus ' actually occurs , which in English becomes Most High ' , the structure of the Latin sentence being quite different from that of the English ; this leaves me free to use the words , Thou only art most high in the glory of God the Father . Amen ' , as a fitting background for what is , to some of us , the greatest musical movement ever written . ( 1947 and 1948 )  | Shrubsole We are told in the text-books that the eighteenth century was the nadir of English music . As a matter of fact it is from the eighteenth century that some of the strongest and most characteristic of our musical invention dates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a hymn-tune or a chant ; but what does size matter ? Who would not rather have drawn eight bars straight from the fountainhead than have compiled whole symphonies strained very thin through the medium of the best foreign models ? It has always been the case in the history of English music that the bright young sparks with dazzling ideas , who imagine the home circle too narrow and the home ideals too low wander off , spiritually if not physically , to foreign countries and return lisping in bad German or Italian , and have left it to the homely people with homely names , who practised their art in their plebeian homes and in the chapels in the local lanes Niles Lane Chapel ' ? what a picture it calls up ! ) , to write what was characteristic and strong and lasting . The fashionable and learned world knew nothing of these humble folk . The fashionable amateurs were worshipping at the shrine of Handel and Buononcini ; the learned , as typified by Burney , travelled round Europe discovering Porpora and Philipp Emmanuel Bach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why did J. S. Bach mean nothing to Burney ? Was it because J. S. Bach was too democratic and had to wait for a later generation , who after the Industrial Revolution brought into prominence their ideals of Miles Lane ' ? namely , the people who sang in the local choirs and choral societies to whom music meant scraping on the fiddle and blowing on the clarinet in the parlour behind the shop after business hours ?  | John Sebastian Bach wrote ( of necessity , I admit ) for the amateur ; that is why Bach 's voice parts are so interesting and Handel 's so dull . Bach knew that unless he gave his amateurs something interesting to sing they would desert him . Handel knew that the unhappy professional choralist had to sing what he was told or he would lose his fee . The truth is that J. S. Bach is much more akin to Shrubsole than to Burney . Both had the outlook of the local musician ' ? the life bounded by the church choir and the town choral society . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art typified by the primo uomo ' were not for them . It is true that Bach 's fame penetrated to Berlin and that Shrubsole was for a short time organist at Bangor Cathedral , but Bach was glad to be home again with Magdalena and the children and Shrubsole had to leave Bangor because he openly preferred the conventicle ' . Shrubsole wrote this one superb tune and no more ? at least no more of any note . He was a one tune ' man . There are many such : people who get a glimpse of the eternal glory once in a lifetime for a few moments and , like Gerontius , are blinded by it and turn their faces away for ever ; but in that one moment these Shrubsolian composers may have achieved something which neither Beethoven nor Bach could have bettered . It is to be noted that these moments will not be realized without long and careful preparation , so that the interminable oratorios and cantatas of minor composers which are now crowding our salvage heaps are not waste , because without them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on these foundations that the music of a nation is built up on this soil , and on this only , that the great artist can come to maturity . It takes a thousand small composers to make one great one ? this is some comfort to those of us who feel the urge to ' fmd out musical tunes ' , knowing at the same time that our compositions are destined for the lumber-room during our lifetime and eventually for the waste-paper baskets of our executors . At all events our forgotten symphonies and fugues will form the humus ' which alone can fertilize the great flower which blooms but once in a hundred years . Of course , Miles Lane ' owes something to the splendid words to which it is set , which , as Percy Dearmer writes , rang the changes on the rhymes to " Lord of All " . Immortality was the inevitable  | result ' , but it was left to Shrubsole to add the coping-stone to the structure with his threefold repetition of the words Crown Him ' . I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in that other great tune Helmsley ' , where the double repetition of Deeply wailing ' and ' O come quickly ' produces an almost unbearable emotional stress , and we fmd its reductio ad absurdum in the probably apocryphal Come down Sal ' and O for a man ' story . The composer of Miles Lane ' realized to the full the dramatic possibilities of this repetition . Great men do not necessarily invent the means which they use , but they see their full possibilities . Bach did not invent the Choral Prelude , but he carried it to its logical conclusion . Beethoven did not invent the sonata form , but he developed it from a precise dance pattern to an epic poem . This , then , is the history of a tune which Elgar is credibly reported to have pronounced the finest in English hymnody ; and , be it noted , the tune is not by Byrd or Purcell , Boyce or Arne , it was not written for Westminster Abbey or York Minster , it was composed by William Shrubsole for Miles Lane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which arises direct from the spiritual needs of that great middle class which is the salt of England 's earth . What is the moral of all this ? Virginia Woolf writes : Masterpieces are not single and solitary births ; they are the outcome of many years ' thinking in common , of thinking by the body of the people , so that the experience of the many is behind the single voice . Without Veit Bach there would never have been John Sebastian . Would the Magic Flute ever have existed without the spade-work of Adam Hiller ? These lesser people , with their limited but intense vision , can concentrate that vision into sixteen bars better than those great ones whose minds are occupied with symphonies forty minutes long , and it is certainly true that whereas Shrubsole could not have written Gerontius , Elgar could not have written Miles Lane ' .

( 1943 )  | THE MAKING OF MUSIC Why Do We Make Music ? Why do we make music ? There can be no doubt that at certain emotional moments most people want to make particular kinds of noises . Indeed , we may say with Carlyle that if we search deep enough there is music everywhere . But why ? Neither I , nor anyone else , has been able to solve that problem . But one thing we can be certain of : we do not compose , sing , or play music for any useful purpose . It is not so with the other arts : Milton had to use the medium of words whether he was writing Paradise Lost or making out his laundry list ; Velasquez had to use paint both for his Venus and to cover up the dirty marks on his front door . But music is just music , and that is , to my mind , its great glory . How then do I justify music ? There is no need to justify it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know and all I need to know .  | What is Music ? Before we go further we had better have a definition of what we mean by music , and I would define it thus : music is a reaching out to the ultimate realities by means of ordered sound . By ordered sound ' I mean sounds of a definite pitch in a definite rhythm and , perhaps we should add , with a definite harmony . But it may be asked what does music mean ? A lot of nonsense is talked nowadays about the meaning ' of music . Music indeed has a meaning , though it is not one that can be expressed fn words . Mendelssohn used to say that the meaning of music was too precise for words . The hearer may , of course , if he chooses , narrow the meaning of music to fit words or visual impressions , as for example in opera . But this particularization limits the scope of music . The fire on Briinnhilde 's rock may have suggested Wagner 's music to him ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the universal . Liszt used to talk rather foolishly about it being nobler for a piece of music to be about Orpheus than to be a mere pattern in sound , not realizing that it is these great patterns in sound , designed by Beethoven or Bach , which open the magic casements and enable us to understand what is beyond the appearances of life . There are two theories of how these ordered sounds arose . Some people think that they grew out of excited speech , some that they developed from blowing through a pipe pierced at definite intervals with holes . I do not want to set up my opinion against that of those learned musicologists who hold the pipe theory . But an ounce of experience is worth a pound of speculation , and I want to describe a personal experience , when I actually heard excited speech grow into melody . I once heard a sermon at an open-air service in the Isle of Skye . As the preacher spoke in Gaelic , which I do not understand , I was  | able to devote my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that he was out of doors forced him to speak loud , and that , coupled with the emotional excitement which inspired his words , caused him gradually to leave off speaking and actually , unconsciously of course , to sing . At first he was content with a monotone , but as his excitement grew , he gradually evolved the following melodic formulae : Now these melodic formulae are common to the opening of many Scottish and British folk-songs ; here are two examples : ' Bushes and Briars ' This experience has convinced me that these melodic formulae come spontaneously to the minds of primitive singers . We can hardly believe that our preacher obtained his notes by blowing through a mathematically measured pipe . I have lately read a book by the Reverend George Chambers in which he describes how in primitive religious services the logical meaning of the words spoken proved inadequate and was supplemented by song , including cantilenas on pure vowel sounds , which were called ; jubilations ' ; these evidently had a mystical meaning to their singers that words Footnote  | could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , the meaning of music is beyond words . We now come to the question of rhythm . What is rhythm ? I have tried various sources for a satisfactory definition and have , so far , failed . Frank Howes , the musical critic of the London Times , calls it an innate faculty for the apprehension of time ' . Here is Professor Carl Seashore 's definition : An instinctive disposition to group recurrent sense impressions vividly and with precision , mainly by time or intensity , or both , in such a way as to derive pleasure and efficiency through the grouping . ' I can not see that either of these is very helpful . Other writers talk magniloquently about the importance of rhythm , not only in art , but in life , without troubling to explain what they mean when they talk about the rhythm of life . ( Incidentally , I much dislike the modern practice of using the technical terms of one art to illustrate another , as when one speaks of the tempo of an essay , or the orchestration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Perhaps the word is indefinable . A French musician is reported to have said to a lady who asked him what rhythm was , Madame , if you have already rhythm in your nature , there is no need for me to explain it to you ; if you have not , you would not understand my explanation . ' Or there is Lord Haldane 's famous epigram : I can not define an elephant , but I recognize one when I see it . ' In the same way , without being able to explain it , those who are naturally musical can appreciate rhythm , or the want of it , in a piece of music . Here are one or two examples of the way in which a very slight alteration in rhythm can entirely change the nature of a melody . Compare the opening of Brahms 's B flat Pianoforte Concerto with the Inter oves ' from Verdi 's Requiem . Both extracts are in the same key , their notes are identical ? except for one slight rhythmical change . But how extraordinarily different they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The well-known English dance-tune , Sellenger 's Round ' , apparently crossed over to Germany , and by the ironing out of the rhythm became converted from a lively dance measure to a solemn hymn-tune . And as a climax I will quote from Edmund Gurney 's The Power of Sound , in which by rhythmical distortion he converts the magnificent chorale melody , ' En ' feste Burg ' , into a vulgar jig tune . J. S. Bach , after Luther connexion it must be confessed that the tune as Martin Luther is supposed to have played it on his flute to his family seems rather a poor affair ; it was left to Bach to develop it into magnificence in his Cantata No. 80 . The Greek word rhythmos means flow ' ; so flow may be taken to be an essential part of rhythm . An orderly succession of sounds at regular intervals is also a part of rhythm , but it is not , as many people imagine , the whole of rhythm . The ticking of a clock , for example , is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago an American , Dr. Thaddeus Lincoln Bolton , made the following experiment : A machine like a clock , with absolutely regular ticks but without any accent , was set going , and several people were asked to give their impression of what they heard .  | Almost all said that after a certain number of ticks , usually three or four , the next appeared louder . This was a purely mental illusion and was due to the desire for rhythmical quality implicit in their nature . This gives us another principle of rhythm , that of strong and weak accent , which the monks of Solesmes in their treatise on plainsong describe as elan et repos . This principle has been called by other writers exertion and rest ' , or impulse and relax ' . The Greeks , in their poetry , used the words arsis and thesis , rising and falling ' , to describe the rhythmical qualities of poetic metres . Incidentally , both these words are derived from dancing . I wish now to digress a moment to say something about rhythm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to music , and as we can not have rhythm without time in music , so we can not have poetical rhythm without metre . But the rhythm of poetry is something more than this . Is not the caesura a momentary breaking of the metre for the sake of the larger aspect of rhythm ? In poetry there are always two kinds of accent , that supplied by the sense of the passage and that supplied by the nature of the metre . Often these coincide , but sometimes they are at variance , as when the meaning of a passage carries on over the end of a line . There is the well-known story of the little girl who complained to her mother that she did not want her grave to be as little as her bed . She had been singing the words , Teach me to live that I may dread The grave , as little as my bed . When she sang it with the tune , it became , Teach me to live that I may dread , The grave as little as my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clown 's prologue in A Midsummer Night 's Dream . I should like to add one personal experience . I was setting to music one of Gilbert Murray 's translations of Euripides , and I came upon these lines : Only on them that spurn Joy , may his anger burn . ' Footnote  | I pointed out to Professor Murray that if I set the words strictly according to their meaning , it would convert the verse into prose : Only on them that spurn joy , may his anger burn . If I set it strictly according to the metre , it would make nonsense of the words : Only on them that spurn , Joy may his anger burn . He solved my difficulties by declaiming the lines to me in a manner which I can describe only by musical notation : On-ly on them that spurn Joy , may his anger burn From the question of rhythm we pass naturally to the question of form , which is , after all , nothing more than rhythm on a large scale . We often hear people say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a good tune when I hear it . ' They do not realize that to appreciate the simplest tune requires a knowledge of form . The physical ear can hear only one sound , or a vertical group of sounds , at a time ; the rest is a question of memory , co-ordination , and anticipation . When the first note passes on to the second , the hearer must not only keep the first note in memory , but co-ordinate it with the second , and so on to the third ; and occasionally he has to anticipate what is to come . When community singers are learning a new tune , they often get the tune wrong because they anticipate a different note from what actually comes . If we did not have these powers , the simplest tune would be meaningless . To appreciate the Hammerklavier ' Sonata or the Ninth Symphony requires exactly the same qualities as the appreciation of the simplest tune ? such as The Bluebell of Scotland ' , which any child can learn ? only to a greater degree . Musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but is simply the development of a power natural to the human ear and the human mind . To understand a big symphonic work there is no need to look up text-books or memorize regulations ; one need only develop the qualities of attention , memory , and co-ordination to the utmost . One thing , however , is needful : the whole passage , whether it be a folk tune or a symphony , must grow , organically , from its roots .  | This leads us on to the question of form and content . These two words are often taken to mean separate and opposite parts of an artistic structure . We talk about the form of a sonata being good and its content poor ; but it not the content poor because the form is bad ? And so we go on , ad infinitum . It is the content which settles the form of any organic structure . What , after all , is good content ? Is it not a matter of suitability to its purpose ? The opening theme of the Eroica ' Symphony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but what a wonderful foundation for a great movement ! The famous drum passage at the end of the Scherzo of Beethoven 's C minor Symphony would not , without its context , be evidence of the mind of a great composer ; but coming where it does , as a sort of resurrection from the abyss , at the end of the Scherzo , and then building up on those reiterated drum taps into the glorious outburst of the finale , does it not reveal the master mind at work ? The theme connected with the Rheingold in Wagner 's Ring is a little flourish such as any boy bugler might have invented . But coming where it does , its dramatic effect is overwhelming . In all these cases there is organic connexion between the whole and the parts . This organic connexion can also exist between symphonic themes which have little physical resemblance . The second subject of the finale of Mozart 's G minor Symphony runs as follows : When it reappears in the recapitulation , it is hardly recognizable , mechanically speaking , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its organic connexion with the original idea make it a true development .  | Now comes the question of harmony . It is doubtful whether this should count as a fundamental element of music , because , so far as we can make out , primitive music had no harmony but was purely melodic . This is true , so far as we can tell , of the early Greek music . The word harmonia does not mean harmony in our sense of the word , but the relation to each other of the notes in the Greek modes . The same is true of the plainsong of the early Christian church , and folk-song , at all events in western Europe , was sung without harmonic accompaniment . However , it seems almost impossible that harmony should not have occurred to primitive singers and players , if only by accident . A cithara player must occasionally have twanged two strings at the same time ; or if two pipe players happened to be playing at the same time within hearing distance of each other , this must have resulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the performers carry on with the good work ? The only explanation can be that when they heard the result they disliked it . There is no physical reason why an eighteenthcentury composer should not have written the whole of Stravinsky and Schonberg , provided he had the pen and paper . We know as a fact that Stanley , an eighteenth-century English composer , experimented with the whole-tone scale about a hundred years before Debussy . Here are two examples , one from Mozart 's quartet in C major and one from Haydn 's Prelude to The Creation , which anticipate Wagner 's Tristan ' . Introduction to Quartet in C major ? Mozart Adagio ii Representation of chaos in The Creation ? Haydn etc.  | These harmonies were , for these two composers , obviously an experiment ; they had no emotional significance for them . For Wagner , an almost identical passage symbolized the height of amorous passion . To Haydn and Mozart they had no such suggestion . When Mozart wanted to be erotic he wrote ' U ci darem ' . Now let us look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects still thrill us , though they are by now the common property of every conservatory student . And when these same students write out bits of Debussy , under the impression that they are composing , their efforts fall dead even before the ink is dry . The moral of all this seems to be that any musical phrase , to be a complete artistic whole , must be the result of a personal emotion . These , then , are the three elements which go to make up music ? melody , rhythm , and harmony .  | How Do We Make Music ? Among the foundations of our art we can count the means by which the singer or player communicates his ideas to others ? what we call musical notation . But first I want to try to dispose of a very prevalent fallacy . My old teacher , Max Bruch , used to say to me , You must not write eye music , you must write ear music . ' He , at all events , had got hold of the truth . But many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not what we hear with our ears but what we see on the printed or written page ; and some of them say with pride that they never want to hear music , it is enough for them to see the score . I suppose I must take them at their word that they can tell exactly what the music will sound like by reading it . Now music differs from the sister art of poetry in that the emotion of poetry grows out of the meaning of words and can be achieved as well by reading as by hearing . If you listen to a poem recited in a language you do not understand , you get very little of the emotion that the poem is intended to express . Sometimes , indeed , you get something quite different , as in the ludicrous case of the audience at Covent Garden who , when the prisoners in Fidelio were whispering leise , leise ' , tittered with amusement because they were reminded of a popular song of the day about a young lady called ' Liza . Many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a painted picture ; but the painter has a dual nature , he is both composer and performer . A picture is the finished article ; but this is not so with a page of music , which is , at the best , a rough description of what the composer hopes will happen if the sounds he has indicated by certain symbols are produced in actuality . Until this takes place the music does not exist . A page of music should be  | compared , not to a picture , but to a map , which indicates by certain conventional signs where north and south are , the direction of a road , what sort of road it is , how high the hills are , whether they are steep or gradual , where there are buildings , and so on . The expert map reader , like the expert score reader , may be able to tell fairly exactly what sort of country he may expect to find , but he can not possibly experience the beauty of the trees , the intense emotion of a wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bicycle , or the delightful relaxation when he reaches the comfortable inn , indicated , in England at all events , by the magic letters ' P.H. ' So it is with the score reader . Haydn would never have declared that his great shout , Let there be light ! ' came straight from heaven if he had been content to read the music and not hear it . Nor would Ulysses have been obliged to be tied to the mast if the Sirens , instead of singing to him , had given him a presentation copy of the full score . In primitive times a written score was unnecessary because the composer and the performer were the same individual , who wanted to touch the heart of those , only , who were within hearing distance . But supposing the musician 's fame grew and people far off wanted to hear his music , what was to be done then ? He must invent and write out a series of symbols which will say in effect , If you sing , blow , scratch , or hit exactly according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same sound as I have been imagining . ' Or , to put it in another way , the composer has a vision and he wants others , out of earshot , to share that vision ; so he crystallizes that vision into definite musical sounds . Then he devises a series of black dots , circles , and so on which will explain what sounds must be made in order to realize his vision . This is what is called musical notation . It is notoriously inadequate , so that those who translate these symbols into music are bound by their personal equation and each performs slightly differently . Thus come about what we call the different renderings by great performers or conductors of the same music . Those who are going to translate these black dots into sound must first find out how to use them adequately . Also , they must learn to realize , when the sounds are made , the connexion between the various notes which they produce and the ultimate meaning of it all . Then , and then only , can they realize in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stages and back again to arrive once more at the magic casements and the fairyland which lies beyond them . What are the sources of a composer 's inspiration ? Now inspiration and originality do not necessarily mean something no one has ever heard before . To my mind the most original of present-day composers is Jean Sibelius . All he says in his great moments seems to me absolutely new ; but his actual method of diction is purely traditional . As Hans Sachs said of Walther , It was so old , it sounded so new . ' We often find that music which at its first appearance seemed outre , to the dismay of the audience and the delight of the composer , becomes quite outmoded after a few years and gives way to a new method of shocking the bourgeois . In Leipzig , in the eighteenth century , Bach was already considered an old fogey , and all the bright young things swore by Telemann . Bach , after a period of eclipse , has come back into his own , while Telemann only bores us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hailed by one school of German thought as something new and incomprehensible to the public , while Brahms was condemned as being routinier and academic . Now Brahms sounds as fresh as ever , while , to one hearer at least , the music of Liszt seems intolerably old-fashioned . Therefore I beg all young composers not to try to be original , within the narrow sense of the word . Originality will come of itself if it is in one 's nature . This does not mean that the composer must be careless and thoughtless . It is hard , indeed , to find a true expression of one 's vision . But the artist must not rest until he has discovered the mot juste . If another composer has said the same thing before , so much the worse for the other composer . The originality , or perhaps I should say the personality , of music depends very little on the actual outline of the notes . It derives from something more subtle , which perhaps we can not define but can recognize at once . Schumann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from other people 's . Here are three fugue subjects , each distinct and individual , but built up on the same phrase : And with His stripes ' ? Handel memo  | Forty-eight Preludes and Fugues , No. 20 , from Book II ( transposed ) ? Bach mom . One of the most important elements of our art is the craft which must inevitably accompany it ? the craft of the composer , the performer , and the instrument maker . These three are inseparably connected . The player must have something to play ; the composer is impotent unless there is someone to realize his ideas ; and both of them are lost , except of course in the case of vocal music , unless there is someone who can devise and construct a machine to carry out the composer 's ideas through the skill of the performer . In primitive times these three persons were probably merged in one : a man thought of a tune ; next he had to cut a reed and pierce it with holes so as to make the noises he needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these noises . But perhaps things did not always happen in that order . Perhaps he heard a song tune and , having a sore throat , wanted to realize it in some other way . Or perhaps , like the lady in The Lost Chord ' , his ' fingers wandered idly Over the noisy keys ' until he found something that he liked . Or perhaps he made the pipe first and in trying it out hit upon a good tune . These methods still exist in modem times . We are told in textbooks that a composer must write down his ideas without going near an instrument . Indeed composing at the pianoforte ' was described by R. O. Morris as not quite playing the game ' . Nevertheless it is a practice that I hope all young composers will indulge in freely , when they are in the mood and the teacher is out of earshot . Inspiration does not necessarily come from the brain . Unfortunately , one can not play the pianoforte with one 's solar plexus , but I see no reason why ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ravel used to blame me for trying to compose without using a pianoforte , saying , How then can you invent new harmonies ? ' I  | do not suggest to composers that they should invent , like the young genius in the films , with one hand holding a pen and the other improvising at the pianoforte , but I can see no moral harm , and great artistic advantage , in making certain of our ideas by trying them over and exploring their possibilities at the pianoforte . Where does craft end and art begin ? When I first heard the Prelude to Lohengrin , I wondered how Wagner had devised all those wonderful high string effects . But when I saw the full score I realized that I , or any other composer , would have done the same if only we had thought of the music . I was like the schoolboy who said , I could easily have written all that Shakespeare stuff myself if I 'd only thought of it . ' Craft by itself can do nothing , I admit , and in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great skill finds his invention at a low ebb , he can still write music which almost deceives the elect , and he himself sometimes can not tell whether he is inspired or whether he is doing mere routine work . Nevertheless , the most inspired composer is impotent unless his craft keeps pace with his art . It is now fashionable to teach children painting without any technical training . They are given a paintbox and a brush and told to express themselves ' . I have seen the results . The children could not draw a straight line and had no idea of anatomy or perspective . When I pointed this out to the drawing mistress , she rebuked me and told me that the feeling ' was wonderful . Fortunately , in music we still believe , to a certain extent , in technique . But , in England at all events , we are no longer allowed to speak of harmony and counterpoint but must call our theoretic studies paper work ' . I am glad to say that I was brought up in the traditional manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cherubinic system of counterpoint and have never regretted it . At a recent meeting of modern composers the only thing they all agreed on was that the only sure foundation for musical composition was strict counterpoint . We now come to a very important factor in our art , the means by which we make the necessary noises . The chief of these is the human voice , which has been called the perfect instrument ? perfect in the sense that there is a minimum of mechanism between the initial impulse and the result . The voice in this respect is unlike the  | oboe or horn , in which the connexion is not so direct between the performer 's will and the sound he makes . The scope of the human voice is , of course , limited . The range of the four main voices , bass , tenor , contralto , and soprano , is not more than four octaves , from C below the bass clef to c " ' above the treble clef , except in the case of Russian basses and freak sopranos . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal ; most people can sing a bit . Moreover , the technique and the nature of the human voice is very much what it was two thousand years ago . This is why choral music has remained in the straight road much more than has instrumental writing . In a cappella singing there are no instrument makers to lure the composer aside with exciting new devices . When Stravinsky writes his Symphony of Psalms , one can feel that he is dealing with something fundamental , almost primitive . In the choral music of Copland the tradition of the white spiritual unconsciously affects his music . Music for voices deals with something essential , not with the tricks of presentation . Whether the instrument or voice came first , there can be very little doubt that the pipe and harp appear very soon in primitive music , and the question arises , Was it the inventions of instrument makers which enticed composers into new styles of music or was it the imperious demands of the composers for fresh means of expression which led the instrument makers to see what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a pipe for Amaryllis to play the little tunes that she had invented ; did Amaryllis say that her new tune demanded an extra hole in the pipe , or did Strephon tell Amaryllis that he had pierced a new hole and expected her , forthwith , to make use of it ? Up to the sixteenth century music was almost entirely vocal , unable to move very fast , but capable of holding a sound for a long time . Then came the development of the lute and virginals , unable to sustain sounds like the voice but able to play very quickly . So composers of virginal music invented a new means of covering the ground by the use of elaborate scales and arpeggios , as we find in the final cadences of almost all virginal music . These limitations and new capabilities led the way from the pure choral counterpoint of Palestrina to the instrumental polyphony of Bach . For the harpsichord , though it could not hold long notes , could play the quick  | passages and could achieve phrases and intervals which would be unsingable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his vocal works , has an instrumental foundation . I have it on the authority of Tovey that Bach never wrote for unaccompanied chorus . Even in his motets and chorales the voices were doubled by instruments , which enabled them to achieve passages that they could not have sung unaccompanied , with the result that a choral technique developed . Nowadays we often sing these compositions a cappella , and to my mind they sound very beautiful that way . We are told that we are wrong to perform them thus because that was not what Bach intended . Are we so sure that he did not so intend them , but was prevented by the inadequacy of the means at his disposal ? Sir George Dyson once said to me that in his opinion Bach never heard a decent performance of one of his cantatas or motets . We know that he complained bitterly of the inferiority of his players and singers . Are we not then justified in modifying his instrumentation where it is obvious that he was buying a pig in a poke ? There is good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his cloth , an instance being the beautiful passage for the lute from the St. John Passion , to which Bach appended a note that if necessary it could be played on the organ ! In Bach 's time the pianoforte had only just been invented , and he is reported to have commented unfavorably on the imperfect examples which were shown him by Frederick the Great . Tovey was of the opinion that if Bach had known a modem grand pianoforte he would have preferred its tone to the nasty jangle of the harpsichord to which he was condemned for filling in his continuo . This question of the continuo , or figured bass , requires a little more consideration . If we look at a full score of an aria from a Bach Passion or the B minor Mass , we find something very different from what appears in the vocal score editions . In the full score we see the voice part and , usually , only the bass , with perhaps a line for an obbligato instrument . The bass sometimes has figures under it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director , or his substitute , sat at the harpsichord or organ improvising these inner parts and generally keeping the whole performance together . What initiated this continuo system ? The music of the great  | choral period , the sixteenth century , made use of no such device . The figured bass arose from weakness rather than from strength . About the year L600 some Italian amateurs devised the beginnings of opera . They had very little technical knowledge of music and therefore left the filling in of the harmony , we may suppose , to some professional expert , indicating to him only the bass and the voice parts . This was all very well for a recitative , accompanied by a few chords , but to hear a large choral work thickened out by the continual presence of the harpsichord or organ must have become intolerably monotonous . But it obtained all through the eighteenth century until the advent of the conductor and the increased efficiency of the performers made it unnecessary . But even now , in solo songs of the Bach period , we usually have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A good grand pianoforte does this much less obtrusively and more artistically than the harpsichord . But I am sorry to say that in obedience to the new Bach-as-hewrote-it fashion this instrument is again raising its unpleasant head . The clarinet is a good example of the way in which an instrument will stimulate a composer . It was not an inevitable part of the orchestra in the time of Bach and Handel ; it belonged chiefly to the open-air wind band and was , I imagine , a coarse and rather loud instrument , as its name , little trumpet ' , suggests . But in the early eighteenth century the conductor of the well-known Mannheim orchestra added what must have been an improved version of the clarinet to his band . It was here that Mozart heard this beautiful instrument , for which he later wrote a concerto . He also added a clarinet part to the score of his G minor Symphony . Haydn followed suit , first using the instrument rather tentatively to fill up the tuttis ; but when he wrote the Prelude to The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then is a case of the instrument maker prompting the composer . It was just the opposite with Wagner and his tubas : he wanted four of these instruments to suggest Valhalla , in the Ring ? higher in pitch and rather thinner in tone than the ordinary bass tuba . So he set to work with an instrument maker and together they devised the so-called Wagner tubas . I fear that it is the mid-nineteenth-century composers who are to blame for the deterioration of the modern horn and trumpet . They  | were continually demanding from the trumpet higher and higher notes and from the horn more and more agility , with the result that the noble old trumpet in F had to be given up in favour of a tinny little instrument in a higher key and the true French horn , the soul of orchestral poetry , disappeared in favour of an instrument which looks , indeed , like a horn but sounds more like a mixture of a saxophone and a euphonium . All of Richard Strauss 's tricks can be played easily on this instrument , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bubble , but its poetry is gone . A few years ago I heard the opening of Schubert 's C major Symphony played on a real horn , and all the world beyond the world seemed open to me . Later on I heard it played on a modern instrument ; the notes were as certain as if they were being played on an organ , but the magic was no longer there . Hubert Parry used to say that the beauty of the French horn was partly due to its human fallibility . Is not this true , to a certain extent , of all instrumental playing ? Does not the thrill of sixteen violins playing together come from the fact that they are not scientifically in tune with each other ? Would not the wonderful surge of the opening of Schubert 's Unfinished ' Symphony be lost if the violoncellos and basses moved from note to note with mathematical exactness at the same moment ? An orchestra must not become a perfect machine . Now comes the question of making the instrument first and finding the music for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect . He did not , of course , make instruments himself , but he thought out such devices as the four brass bands in the Messe des morts , and in the excitement of the invention of the means forgot about the end . When it came to the point , he could think of nothing better for his four brass bands to play than a banal march tune . This was indeed putting the cart before the horse . And so the old problem of form and content crops up again ; the idea and its presentation should be simultaneous and indivisible . I have purposely reserved for special discussion the most important instrument in our modern musical armoury . The pianoforte is a comparatively new invention . It was a long time before it superseded the clavichord as a household instrument and the harpsichord for public use . The famous organ builder , Gottfried  | Silbermann , made some experimental pianofortes for Frederick the Great ; Bach tried them and , it is reported , did not care for them . Probably these early examples were very imperfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the pianoforte sound like a harpsichord . Even Beethoven 's pianoforte was a very different affair from our modem grand . Gradually the new instrument acquired its own character and atmosphere . The tone of the harpsichord was constant : only by the manipulation of stops and manuals could the player vary from loud to soft , while crescendo and diminuendo were impossible . A good player on a modern pianoforte can pass at will , gradually or quickly , from an almost inaudible softness to a thundering loudness , and this almost entirely by finger pressure , which has no more effect on the harpsichord than it does on the organ . The pianist can pick out a phrase for special prominence in the middle of a contrapuntal web in a manner that was impossible to his predecessor ; by the use of the loud pedal he can prolong the sound of a note and thus evoke the idea of a violin or vocal cantabile . A clever pianist can suggest the orchestra , the organ , or even the choir , by his playing and can often get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orchestra . Not only can a pianoforte look forward , it can also look back . Music written for the earlier instruments can also be played with good effect on the pianoforte . It may not be exactly what the composer intended , but composers are bound by their means , and I have little doubt that Bach would have thought that his music sounded better on our modem instruments than on those which he had at his disposal . I have heard many of the Forty-Eight Preludes and Fugues played alternately on the pianoforte and harpsichord , and I have no doubt which I prefer . For one thing , on the harpsichord the music sounded like period music ' . To deprive a composition of its period might be fatal to something which is only of its period . Though Bach belongs superficially to the eighteenth century , spiritually he belongs equally to the twentieth . Therefore we can interpret him by our own minds and means and find that he lives for us , more than for the burghers of Leipzig ; for them Bach was indeed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , originating , I believe , in Germany ,  | of playing Bach 's music as he wrote it ' , which , as I suppose , means that we must , if possible , use the exact instruments which Bach used , presumably at the same pitch , and play them exactly as the eighteenth-century musicians played them ? violins with flat bridges and bows held taut by the thumb . We should , of course , substitute the harpsichord for the pianoforte and make use of that atrocious bubble-and-squeak monstrosity , the so-called baroque organ . Our oboes would have to bray like bagpipes and our horns bellow like bulls . Well , we can not do this even if we wanted to , and if we could , I can not imagine anyone wanting to substitute the coarse tone and asthmatic phrasing of Bach 's oboe for the exquisite cantabile of one of our fine symphonic players in the great watching song from the Matthew Passion . The pianoforte at its best is now the universal provider , and at its worst , the maid of all work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be used to realize the most ethereal fancies of Chopin or Debussy and at another , to thump out a comic song in a tavern . The pianoforte is equally at home in the palace or the cottage and has a colossal specialized literature of every degree of goodness or badness . Thus the pianoforte has completed the democratization of our art . The performer 's intonation on a pianoforte does not depend on his own musical nature but on the state of his instrument . That is why for every one player on the flute or violin there are probably a hundred who can tap out a tune on the pianoforte . Here , then , is mass-made music for the masses ; we must be careful that quantity does not oust quality . May I put in a word for the pianoforte duet ? When I was young and orchestral concerts were few , when full scores were beyond our means and the radio and phonograph were not yet invented , our chief means for studying orchestral music was the pianoforte duet . With all our modern aids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a daydream , without giving it our real attention . But the pianoforte duet gave us an intimate knowledge of the great classics which we are all too likely to miss if we turn on the radio and the phonograph.
