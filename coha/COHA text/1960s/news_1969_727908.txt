txt PARIS , June 14 ( in ? Georges Pompidou , dismissed as premier by Gen. Charles de Gaulle 11 months ago , gained strength in a final popularity poll today and held a wide lead over Alain Poher , interim president , for tomorrow 's French presidential election Pompidou , who served for six years as De Gaulle 's premier before he was replaced last July , was given 58 per cent of the vote to Poher 's 42 per cent in a poll published by the newspaper France-Soir . Confirms Other Polls The poll confirmed a series of other soundings in the last three days that put Pompidou 's margin at 56 to 60 per cent of the vote . French public opinion samplers were remarkably accurate in predicting the defeat of the national referendum that led to De Gaulle 's resignation April 27 and Pompidou 's victory in the first round of voting two weeks ago . The son of a school teacher , Pompidou , 57 , was dismissed by de Gaulle when he seemed to have gained too much independent power within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France 's student-worker revolt last spring . Both Pompidou and Poher 60 , were called reactionaries and " Tweedledum and Tweedledee " by the Communist party and other left-wing groups who urged their supporters to abstain from voting . Predict Abstention Rate France-Soir said the abstentions would run to 33 per cent . Other polls said the rate would be from 20 to 28 per cent . Without the communist directive , 22.42 per cent of the registered voters stayed home during the first round June 1 . The Communists , aitno not mentioned by name , seemed to be the subject of a warning today from the interior ministry saying that electioneering or physical threats near the polls would he punished . In a statement last week , the party told its members it " would have eyes everywhere " to report any stepping out of line and voting . The abstention move , conceived to assert communist leadership within France 's divided left wing , hurt Poher 's candidacy more than Pompidou 's . Counting on Left After the first round in which neither won a majority  --  Pompidou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the interim president was counting on communist and left socialist votes to help him beat Pompidou . Even some of Poher 's normal allies , gathered from France 's centrists , called on him to drop out of the race . Among the seven candidates participating in the first round , only Gaston Deferre of the Socialist party swung to Poher . As newspapers lined up the issues , column by column to show how the candidates stood , few essential differences appeared . Tell Foreign Stand In foreign policy , Poher was for considering British entry into the Common Market with more interest than shown by De Gaulle , keeping France in the Atlantic alliance while maintaining friendly relations with Russia , increasing the nation 's role in trying to unify Europe , and working to bring peace in the middle east . None of these positions forced hard , contradictory stands from Pompidou , who seemed to take a more liberal line than De Gaulle , but one without drastic changes . When he was asked about lifting the arms embargo to Israel , Pompidou said the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of-force was noted in the middle east .
