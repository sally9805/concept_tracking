txt A slowdown In the increase in relief rolls here  --  even more than in city budget plans last spring ? is currently counted on to supply the $3-million for extra police overtime in the next four months . Frederick O'R . Hayes , the city 's Budget Director , said in an interview yesterday that welfare rolls had risen by only 5,000 people in July and that the average monthly increase for the preceding three months had been 7,000 . His budget last April was based on a monthly increase of 7,500 ? far below the average of 16,000 a month last year and the peak of 23,575 in July , 1968 . Mayor Lindsay has ordered overtime work in both the Sanitation and Police Departments . As many as 1,400 sanitation men are working every Sunday this month , and 500 extra policemen are shortly to begin patrolling each night during high-crime hours . The police yesterday reported a 2.7 per cent decline in reported crimes here , and a spokesman for the Mayor attributed it in part to the introduction of extra police patrols  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the first decline in reported crimes in three years , the police recorded 42,974 crimes in July , compared with 44,172 for July of 1968 . Last night Mayor Lindsay , in a statement , called on Governor Rockefeller to use part of a potential state revenue surplus of $35-million to $40-million to help welfare families buy school clothing for children . Welfare clients have been demonstrating and keeping children out of school in protests against state legislative bans on such former clothing grants . Mayor Lindsay made public a similar appeal from Joseph Monscrrat , president of the Board of Education , who said the hoard believed elimination of the clothing allotment interfered with proper education . Despite the hoped-for welfare savings . Mr. Hayes said the city would be " lucky " if it eventually broke even by the end of its fiscal year next June 30 . Currently , he said , the stock transfer tax is running about 7 per cent ? $2u-million " ? below the estimated yield , which had been counted on for $305-million for the $6.6-billion budget . Concern Expressed If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2,000 people a month over 12 months , this might save $10-'million to $11-million , Mr. Hayes said . Other city sources expressed concern yesterday that the cuts in Medicaid programs for the poor might force more people to go on relief during the year . Mr. Hayes said his experts had based their forecasts of the welfare slowdown on a hypothesis that cuts in relief grants ? such as the Legislature ordered last spring  --  would reduce the applicants for aid . Over 1,025,000 people are now on the city 's relief rolls , according to welfare officials . The police overtime is to con7 tinue until 600 more patrolmen are trained and ready to work at straight-time rates . Mr. Hayes said that the budget was also currently facing deficit problems in the Sanitation and Correction Departments and that this situation might also arise in the Fire Department . In the Sanitation Department , he said , recruitment has been stepped up because new retirement provisions have created " twice as many eligibles " as a year ago . In the Correction Department , Mr. Hayes said , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoners from overcrowded city prisons to Dannemora State Prison . He said the city was paying the slate $5 a day for each prisoner , the same as the state had contributed when the prisoners were here , despite what he called an actual daily cost of $10 . Now , he said , the city is also having to pay for transporting the men . In an appearance on the WNBC-TV " Direct Line " program during the day , Mr. Hayes said the city would need $2-billion to $3-billion in new annual revenues over the next four years . Asked if a new Mayor could raise this sum , he said , " I fail to see how he could have a significant effect . " U.S. and State Aid Asked The big factors , he said , are burdens that the Federal and state governments should take over , such as welfare and Medicaid , on which , he asserted , New York City now bears 27 per cent of the costs . ' Even if the city Income tax were doubled , he said , this would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's current proposal for a $1,600 Federal grant for welfare families of four persons annually projects a $4-billion national expenditure , Mr. Hayes said , but only " a $20-million net benefit for New York . " The Budget Director said the commuter earnings tax of 0.25 per cent of net income was " abysmally , outrageously low . " He asserted that commuters take out " something very close to 15 to 20 per cent of all the wage and salary income in the city . " The Citizens Budget Commission , a civic research group , made public a comparison of city budgets that cited the welfare appropriation as taking a 23 per cent slice of the expense budget this year for the second year in a row . The portion ? for education dropped from 20 per cent to 18 . The welfare appropriation is currently $1.519,000 , with education set for $1,203,000.
