A few months after the death of Com poser Maurice Ravel in 1937 , his brother Edouard saw Disney 's feature-length cartoon Snow White and decided that " this is the way L'Enfant et les Sortileges should be presented . Ravel 's second and last opera had for its locale the mind of a child . In its cast are teapots as big as a man , cats who talk of love , squirrels who ruminate on redemption . It calls for 18 principals and a chorus of tree frogs , and one of its climactic solo passages by a Chinese cup ( mezzo-soprano ) consists of this mad litany , set to a foxtrot tempo : <P> Ping , pong , ping , pong <P> Keng-a fou , Mahjong <P> Cas-ka-ra , harakiri , Sessue Hayakawa <P> Kek-ta fouhtuh d'mon Kaoua ? <P> Ravel 's opera was a critical success but a popular failure at the Opra-Comique in Paris in 1926 ( the love duet of the cats , with its mewing violins , enraged the audience ) . Nevertheless , L'Enfant contains some of Ravel 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recording conducted by Lorin Maazel-the first of the opera in stereo-again demonstrates . <P> The story , by Colette , has a Hans Christian Andersen simplicity : a naughty child , in a harlequin rage , rips up the furniture , twists the cat 's tail , yanks the clock 's pendulum and exults : " I 'm free-naughty and free . " In the second scene , the animals gather to threaten the child , forgive him only after he has come to the aid of an injured squirrel . <P> The libretto was ideal for a composer who retained a lifelong longing for the " green paradise of childhood . " Ravel was determined that " the vocal line should dominate , " and it does , against an orchestra as luminous as any Ravel ever created . Among the opera 's more effective touches : a procession of shepherds and shepherdesses to a sinuous dance theme played by reed pipes and tambourines ; the dizzying dance of the digits ( Mon Dieu ! c'est I'arithmetique ! ) to raucous and leering brasses . <P> Other new records : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Montreal , conducted by George Little ; Vox ) . The strange , polyphonic songs of the 16th century French composer who pushed musical description to a new high-or low . Stereo fans will be fascinated by two pieces in particular : Le Chant des Oiseaux , in which the chorus twitters and coos , and La Guerre , in which the chorus , without lifting its collective voice beyond a murmur , suggests the confused clamor of the battlefield . <P> Mozart : Concertos for Horn and Orchestra ( Albert Linder , horn ; Vienna State Opera Orchestra , conducted by Hans Swarowsky ; Vanguard ) . The four concertos Mozart wrote for horn are all beauties - full of pert , charming and sometimes humorous ideas put together with faultless style and taste . Danish Hornist Linder does them justice . <P> Mauricio Kagel : TransiciOn II ( Time ) . With its suddenly splatted chords , its plocks and thunks and harplike glissandos . Argentine-born Composer Kagel 's piece for piano , percussion and magnetic tapes suggests a very drunk fraternity pianist trying to play Stardust in pitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Weirdly compelling , but likely to make few converts to the electronic school .
