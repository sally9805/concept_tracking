One danger in launching a trial bal loon is that the balloonist may get caught up in the mooring cables and carried aloft . Just that sort of aerial accident befell Russia 's Leonid Brezhnev and his Bulgarian allies last week . <P> Speaking before 80 Communist Party delegations in Sofia , Bulgarian Party Boss Todor Zhivkov declared that " conditions are ripening " for a conference , of all loyal Leninists to read Red China out of Communist society . Added Brezhnev : " The leaders of China are more and more submitting their policy to narrow nationalist aims . " <P> The idea of a formal excommunication ceremony to isolate Red China dates from the days of Khrushchev , but the new team of Brezhnev and Kosygin let the matter cool when they took power in 1964 , hoping to close the rift . One good reason : the Kremlin knew it could not count on the support of its Communist allies , for party bosses had made clear their opposition to a Soviet blackball of any Red nation . <P> Sure enough , when Zhivkov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , they came under a barrage of counterfire . Snapped Rumania 's Nicolae Ceausescu : " Nothing should be done to deepen the divergencies and increase the threat of a split . " The Italian and North Korean delegations were equally outspoken in their opposition , while Yugoslavs , Poles , Cubans and North Vietnamese maintained a stony silence . The only big parties to endorse the idea were those of Czechoslovakia , Hungary and France .
