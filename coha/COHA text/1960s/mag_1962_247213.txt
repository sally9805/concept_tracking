The angry Congressman stepped to a microphone , stared scornfully at the nearly empty chamber , and denounced a motion that the House of Representatives recess for three days . " I am becoming more and more disturbed over the failure of the House to get down to work , " he snapped . " This is just about the most do-nothing session I have seen in my 14 years here . " He had figured it all out , and a little later he passed on his statistics to reporters . So far this year , he said , the House has been working an average of only four hours a day , a mere 15 days a month-and each Congressman thus is making $126 a day . " That 's a lot of pay for such a short workday , " he complained . <P> Such waspish criticism is routine for wispy ( 5 ft. 6 in. , 135 Ibs . ) Harold Royce Gross , 62 , seven-term Republican Congressman from Iowa 's farm-rich Third District . Day after day , year after year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Waterloo radio newscaster to scold his colleagues about their leisurely ways , question any and all spending bills , and push what he considers his lonely fight " to save this country from national bankruptcy . " He is a nitpicker and a pest . He detests Washington 's social life ( " I 've never worn a monkey suit " ) , prefers watching wrestling on television with his wife Hazel in their apartment ( " an oasis in a community of synthetic functions " ) . But , as self-appointed caretaker of the congressional conscience , he has his own unique value . The House needs a man like H. R. Gross-although one is probably plenty . <P> No ! Gross practices what he preaches . <P> When he derides Eastern Congressmen as being members of the long-weekending " **27;2445;TOOLONG club , " he can point to his own remarkable record : in the past 14 years he has answered 97.1% of all roll calls . Unlike most Representatives , he stays on the floor between roll calls , listens carefully to the debates . <P> He studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as unimportant . " Mr. Speaker , " Gross cries when a colleague seeks unanimous consent to pass a minor appropriations bill without debate , " reserving the right to object , can the gentleman tell us just what this is all about ? " If Gross does n't like the explanation-as in the case of a bill for a historic memorial in Texas in which the $115,000 appropriation did not even cover the cost of the land-Gross declares loudly : No ! With nonpartisan passion , Gross crusades against spending . When Kennedy was inaugurated , Gross protested that an Army chauffeur was driving Frank Sinatra and Peter Lawford around Washington . <P> He fought an addition of 80 White House police , bitterly asked if they would be used to guard Caroline 's ponies . He objected to President Eisenhower 's being restored to five-star general 's rank unless Congress agreed that Ike would get only his $25,000 annual presidential pension and not his $20,543 Army salary as well .                    @
