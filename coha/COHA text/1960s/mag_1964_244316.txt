As mountains go , Austria 's Patscherkofel is not likely to win any beauty contests . A short ( 7,373 ft. ) , stumpy cone , it looks for all the world like an inverted Dixie cup . But the Patscherkofel makes up in ruggedness what it lacks in looks . At last week 's ninth Winter Olympics , its rocky crags and fir-covered slopes were the site of the men 's downhill , the fastest and toughest course ever to test the mettle of the world 's finest skiers . <P> <P> High Hopes . The weather was sunny enough to make the surface moist and soft , cold enough ( at 29 ) to keep the undercoating hard and fast . U.S. hopes ran high : at the last minute officials had reversed the seedings that determined starting positions , moved both Vermont 's Billy Kidd , 20 , and Colorado 's Buddy Werner , 27 , into the coveted first rank . The luck of the draw gave Kidd first crack at the 10,236-ft. course-and when he flashed past the finish line in 2 min. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record , American joy knew no bounds . But Germany 's Ludwig Leitner clocked 2 min. 19.67 sec. , and France 's Leo Lacroix cut almost a second off that . Then , high above the tree line a grinning , brown-haired Austrian stabbed at the snow with his ski poles and began his run . <P> Egon Zimmermann , 23 , never took a skiing lesson in his life . Born in the Tyrolean resort of Lech am Arlberg , he picked up free pointers by watching rich tourists practice stem Christies on the slopes around the Zimmermann family inn . Packed off to Paris ' ritzy Ledoyen restaurant at 15 to learn the art of French cooking , Egon showed a fine flair for mousse-making-whenever he could be persuaded to come in out of the snow . At 18 , he won all three Alpine events at the Austrian junior championships , and experts began calling him " the new Toni Sailer . " But then he dislocated a shoulder on the eve of the 1960 Olympics . <P> The bad luck followed him last year to Chamonix where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was suddenly waved off the course to avoid a collision with a fallen skier . He dodged the skier all right-and flew off the headwall " like an airplane . " Recalls Zimmermann : " I said to myself , ' Egon , that 's the end-you 're going to break every bone in your body . ' I was lucky . I got off with strained ligaments and twelve days on crutches. "
