AT EASE : STORIES I TELL TO FRIENDS by Dwight D. Eisenhower . 400 pages . Doubleday . $6.95 . <P> <P> In Dwight Eisenhower 's three volumes covering World War II and a major portion of his presidency , his prose was always at Attention or , at best , a stiff Parade Rest . At last Ike is At Ease . He writes of this book : " It will be fun just to wander , with no worries about verbosity , coherence , repetitions or literary criticism . " <P> <P> A " fun " author Eisenhower will never be . But this meandering autobiography does offer a refreshingly human review of Ike 's life as he looks back , at 77 , on the years that took him from a barefoot boy in Abilene to the White Housebound war hero in 1952 . <P> Poker with Bob . In the unhurried , slightly wistful style of an Old Soldier reminiscing in the sun , the general summons up memories of his scrabbling childhood ( " our pleasures were simple - they included survival " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He recalls learning Christian responsibility from his mother , the wonders of Tacitus , Shakespeare and Plato from a Canal Zone general , and the intricacies of playing cool-percentage poker from an Abilene illiterate who could only write his name by " starting it with straight lines around which he drew the necessary curves to spell BOB DAVIS . " <P> Ike never completely outgrew his maverick-cadet personality . He tells of a tedious two-month , coast-to-coast motorcade in 1921 when he and another officer amused themselves by convincing " an Easterner " in the troop that Indians were about to attack the caravan in the wilds of Montana . President Roosevelt once asked Eisenhower how he liked the title " Supreme Commander , " and Ike recalls : " I acknowledged that it did have a ring of importance-something like ' Sultan . ' " And while he was Supreme Commander in London , Ike consistently refused to attend formal dinners-largely , he says , because he was a four-pack-a-day smoker who could not wait for the traditional toast to the King before lighting up . <P> The Reason Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustrations of his peacetime military years . Yet in 1940 , when his son John said he wanted to go to West Point , Eisenhower outlined the drawbacks of being an army professional , then laid out his personal reason for sticking with the career that wound up in the White House . " I said , " writes Ike , " that the real satisfaction was for a man to do the best he could . My ambition in the Army had always been to make everybody I worked for regretful when I was ordered to other duty . " It is a sentence that could have been spoken by a J. P. Marquand hero . It is the thinking of an organization man , a sense of duty sharpened ( but not too much ) by ambition . It hardly suggests greatness , but this is , after all , a book of reminiscences in pace .
