 | the dangerous road before MARTIN LUTHER KING @# I FIRST met Martin Luther King , Jr . nearly three years ago now , in Atlanta , Georgia . He was there on a visit from his home in Montgomery . He was " holed up , " he was seeing no one , he was busy writing a book ? so I was informed by the friend who , mercilessly , at my urgent request . was taking me to King 's hotel . I felt terribly guilty about interrupting him but not guilty enough to let the opportunity pass . Still , having been raised among preachers , I would not have been surprised if King had cursed out the friend , refused to speak to me , and dammed the door in our faces . Nor would I have blamed him if he had , since I knew that by this time he must have been forced to suffer many an admiring fool . But the Reverend King is not like any preacher I have ever met before . For one thing , to state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one likes a world-famous man ? by the time they become world-famous they rarely like themselves , which may account for this antipathy . Yet King is immediately and tremendously winning ; there is really no other word for it ; and there he stood , with an inquiring and genuine smile on his face , in the open door of his hotel room . Behind him , on a desk , was a wilderness of paper . He looked at his friend , he looked at me , I was introduced ; he smiled and shook my hand and we entered the room . I do not remember much about that first meeting because I was too overwhelmed by the fact that I was meeting him at all . There were millions of questions that I wanted to ask him , but I feared to begin . Besides , his friend had warned me not to " bug " him , I was not there in a professional capacity , and the questions I wanted to ask him had less to do with his public role than with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not referring to those maliciously juicy tidbits , those meaningless details , which clutter up the gossip columns and muddy everybody 's mind and obliterate the humanity of the subject as well as that of the reader . I wanted to ask him how it felt to be standing where he stood , how he bore it , what complex of miracles had prepared him for it . But such questions can scarcely be asked , they can scarcely be answered . And King does not like to talk about himself . I have described him as winning , but he does not  | give the impression of being particularly outgoing or warm . His restraint is not , on the other hand , of that icily uneasy , nerve-racking kind to be encountered in so many famous Negroes who have allowed their aspirations and notoriety to destroy their identities and who always - seem to be giving an uncertain imitation of some extremely improbable white man . No , King impressed me then and he impresses me now as a man solidly anchored in those spiritual realities concerning which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hideous piety which is so prevalent in his profession , and it also saves him from the ghastly self-importance which until recently , was all that allowed one to be certain one was addressing a Negro leader . King can not be considered a chauvinist at all , not even incidentally , or part of the time , or under stress , or subconsciously . What he says to Negroes he will say to whites ; and what he says to whites he will say to Negroes . He is the first Negro leader in my experience , or the first in many generations , of whom this can be said ; most of his predecessors were in the extraordinary position of saying to white men , Hurry , while saying to black men , Wait . This fact is of the utmost importance . It says a great deal about the situation which produced King and in which he operates ; and , of course , it tells us a great deal about the man . " He came through it all , " said a friend of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " really unscarred . He never went around fighting with himself , like we all did . " The " we " to whom this friend refers are all considerably older than King , which may have something to do with this lightly sketched species of'schizophrenia ; in any case , the fact that King really loves the people he represents and has ? therefore ? no hidden , interior need to hate the white people who oppose him has had and will , I think , continue to have the most far-reaching and unpredictable repercussions on our racial situation . It need scarcely be said that our racial situation is far more complex and dangerous than we are prepared to think of it as being ? since our major desire is not to think of it at all ? and King 's role in it is of an unprecedented difficulty . He is not , for example , to be confused vi Booker T. Washington , whom we gratefully lowed to solve the racial problem singlehanded It was Washington who assured us , in 1895 , o year before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education of Negroes would not give th any desire to become equals ; they would be c tent to remain ? or , rather , after living for gene tions in the greatest intimacy with whites . t become ? separate . It is a measure of the irrealit to which the presence of the Negro had alread ? reduced the nation that this utterly fantastic idea , which thoroughly controverts the purpose of education , which has no historical or psychological validity , and which denies all the principles on which the country imagines itself to have been founded , was not only accepted with cheers but became the cornerstone of an entire way of life . And this did not come about , by the way , merely because of the venom or villainy of the South . It could never have come about at all without the tacit consent of the North ; and this consent robs the North , historically and actually of any claim to moral superiority . The failure of the government to make any realistic provision for the education of tens of thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squarely into the lap of one man ? who knew , whatever else he may not have known . that the education of Negroes had somehow to be accomplished . Whether or not Washington believed what he said is certainly an interestine question . But he did know that he could accomplish his objective by telling white men what they wanted to hear . And it has never been very difficult for a Negro in this country to figure out what white men want to hear : he takes his condition as an echo of their desires . There will be no more Booker T. Washingtons . And whether we like it or not , and no matter how hard or how long we oppose it , there will be no more segregated schools , there will be no more segregated anything . King is entirely right when he says that segregation is dead . The real question which faces the Republic is just how long , how violent , and how expensive the funeral is going to be ; and this question it is up to the Republic to resolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sooner the corpse is buried . the sooner we can get around to the far more taxing and rewarding problems of integration , or what King calls community , and what I think of as the achievement of nationhood , or , more simply and cruelly , the growing up of this dangerously adolescent country . I saw King again , later that same evening , at  | a party given by this same friend . He came late , did not stay long . I remember him standing in the shadows of the room , near a bookcase , drinking something nonalcoholic , and being patient with the interlocutor who had trapped him in this spot . He obviously wanted to get away and go to bed . King is somewhat below what is called average height , he . is sturdily built , but is not quite as heavy or as stocky as he had seemed to me at first . I remember feeling , rather as though he were a younger , much-loved , and menaced brother , that he seemed very slight and vulnerable to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving for Montgomery the next day , and I called on King in the morning to ask him to have someone from the Montgomery Improvement Association meet me at the airport . It was he who had volunteered to do this for me , since he knew that I knew no one there , and he also probably realized that I was frightened . He was coming to Montgomery on Sunday to preach in his own church . Montgomery is the cradle of the Confederacy , an unlucky distinction which no one in Montgomery is allowed to forget . The White House which symbolized and housed that short-lived government is still standing , and " people , " one of the Montgomery ministers told me , " walk around in those halls and cry . " I do not doubt it , the people of Montgomery having inherited nothing less than an ocean of spilt milk . The boycott had been over for a year by the time I got there , and had been ended by a federal decree outlawing segregation in the busses . Therefore , the atmosphere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in a town so aimlessly hostile , so baffled and demoralized . Whoever has a stone to fling , and flings it , is then left without any weapons ; and this was ( and remains ) the situation of the white people in Montgomery . I took a bus ride , for example , solely in order to observe the situation on the busses . As I stepped into the bus , I suddenly remembered that 1 had neglected to ask anyone the price of a bus ride in Montgomery , and so I asked the driver . He gave me the strangest , most hostile of looks , and turned his face away . I dropped fifteen cents into the box and sat down , placing myself , delicately , just a little forward of the center of the bus . The driver had seemed to feel that my question was but another Negro trick , that I had something up my sleeve , and that to answer my question in anv way would be to expose himself to disaster . He could not guess what I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal demoralization by trying to . And this spirit was the spirit of the town . The bus pursued its course , picking up white and Negro passengers . Negroes sat where they pleased , none very far back ; one large woman , carrying packages , seated herself directly behind the driver . And the whites sat there , ignoring them , in a huffy , offended silence . This silence made me think of nothing so much as the silence which follows a really serious lovers ' quarrel : the whites , beneath their cold hostility , were mystified and deeply hurt . They had been betrayed by the Negroes , not merely because the Negroes had declined to remain in their " place , " but because the Negroes had refused to be controlled by the town 's image of them . And , without this image , it seemed to me , the whites were abruptly and totally lost . The very foundations of their private and public worlds were being destroyed . I had never heard King preach , and I went on Sunday to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brick structure , with a steeple , and it directly faces , on the other side of the street , a white , domed building . My notes fail to indicate whether this is the actual capitol of the state or merely a courthouse ; but the conjunction of the two buildings , the steepled one low and dark and tense , the domed one higher and dead white and forbidding , sums up , with an explicitness a set designer might hesitate to copy , the struggle now going on in Montgomery . At that time in Montgomery , King was almost surely the most beloved man there . I do not think that one could have entered any of the packed churches at that time , if King was present , and not have felt this . Of course , I think that King would be loved by his congregations in any case , and there is always a large percentage of church women who adore the young male pastor , and not always , or not necessarily , out of those grim , psychic motives concerning which everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling in this church which quite transcended anything I have ever felt in a church before . Here it was , totally familiar and yet completely new , the packed church , glorious with the Sunday finery of the women , solemn with the touching , gleaming sobriety of the men , beautiful with children . Here were the ushers , standing in the aisles in white dresses or in dark suits , with arm bands on . People were standing along 36 MARTIN LUTHER KING  | each wall , beside the windows , and standing in the back . King and his lieutenants were in the pulpit , young Martin ? as I was beginning to think of him ? in the center chair . When King rose to speak ? to preach ? I began to understand how the atmosphere of this church differed from that of all the other churches I have known . At first I thought that the great emotional power and authority of the Negro church was being put to a new use , but this is not exactly the case . The Negro church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Negro life , but it had acquired a new power . Until Montgomery , the Negro church , which has always been the place where protest and condemnation could be most vividly articulated , also operated as a kind of sanctuary . The minister who spoke could not hope to effect any objective change in the lives of his hearers , and the people did not expect him to . All they came to find , and all that he could give them , was the sustenance for another day 's journey . Now , King could certainly give his congregation that , but he could also give them something more than that , and he had . It is true that it was they who had begun the struggle of which he was now the symbol and the leader ; it is true that it had taken all of their insistence to overcome in him a grave reluctance to stand where he now stood . But it is also true , and it does not happen often , that once he had accepted the place they had prepared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and took over and controlled his life . He suffered with them and , thus , he helped them to suffer . The joy which filled this church , therefore , was the joy achieved by people who have ceased to delude themselves about an intolerable situation , who have found their prayers for a leader miraculously answered , and who now know that they can change their situation , if they will . And , surely , very few people had ever spoken to them as King spoke . King is a great speaker . The secret of his greatness does not lie in his voice or his presence or his manner , though it has something to do with all these ; nor does it lie in his verbal range or felicity , which are not striking ; nor does he have any capacity for those stunning , demagogic flights of the imagination which bring an audience cheering to its feet . The secret lies , I think , in his intimate knowledge of the people he is addressing , be they black or white , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt and baffle them . He does not offer any easy comfort and this keeps his hearers absolutely tense . He allows them their selfrespect ? indeed , he insists on it . " We know , " he told them , " that there are many things wrong in the white world . But there are many things wrong in the black world , too . We ca n't keep on blaming the white man . There are many things we must do for ourselves . " He suggested what some of these were : " I know none of you make enough money ? but save some of it . And there are some things we 've got to face . I know the situation is responsible for a lot of it , but do you know that Negroes are 10 per cent of the population of St. Louis and are responsible for 58 per cent of its crimes ? We 've got to face that . And we have to do something about our moral standards . And we 've got to stop lying to the white man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think segregation is right , you are co-operating with him in doing evil . " The next time , " he said , " the white man asks you what you think of segregation , you tell him . Mr. Charlie , I think it 's wrong and I wish you 'd do something about it by nine o'clock tomorrow morning ! " This brought a wave of laughter and King smiled , too . But he had meant every word he said , and he expected his hearers to act on them . They also expected this of themselves , which is not the usual effect of a sermon ; and that they are living up to their expectations no white man in Montgomery will deny . There was a dinner in the church basement @#  | afterwards , where , for the first time , I met Mrs. King ? light brown , delicate , really quite beautit ul , with a wonderful laugh ? and watched young Martin circulating among church members and isitors . I overheard him explaining to someone that bigotry was a disease and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's object , but the bigot himself . And these people could only be saved by love . In liberating oneself , one was also liberating them . I was shown , by someone else , the damage done to the church by bombs . King did not mention the bombing of his own home , and I did not bring it up . Late the next night , after a mass meeting in another church , I flew to Birmingham . COURAGEOUS WITNESS I D I D not see King again for nearly three years . I saw him in Atlanta , just after his acquittal by a Montgomery court of charges of perjury , tax evasion , and misuse of public funds . He had moved to Atlanta and was co-pastor , with his father , of his father 's church . He had made this move , he told me , because the pressures on him took him away from Montgomery for such excessively long periods that he did not eel that he was properly fulfilling his ministerial duties there . An attempt had been made on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deranged Negro woman ; and he was about to receive , in the state of Georgia , for driving without a resident driver 's license , a suspended twelve-month sentence . And , since I had last seen him , the Negro student movement had begun and was irresistibly bringing about great shifts and divisions in the Negro world , and in the nation . In short , by the time we met again , he was more beleaguered than he had ever been before , and not only by his enemies in the white South . Three years earlier , I had not encountered very many people ? I am speaking now of Negroes ? who were really critical of him . But many more people seemed critical of him now , were bitter , disappointed , skeptical . None of this had anything to do ? I want to make this absolutely clear ? with his personal character or his integrity . It had to do with his effectiveness as a leader . King has had an extraordinary effect in the Negro world , and therefore in the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex cross fire . He was born in Atlanta in 1929 . He has ' Y Irish and Indian blood in his veins ? Irish from his father 's , Indian from his mother 's side . His maternal grandfather built Ebenezer Baptist Church , which , as I have said , young Martin now co-pastors with his father . This grandfather seems to have been an extremely active and capable man , having been one of the NAACP leaders in Atlanta thirty or forty years ago , and having been instrumental in bringing about the construction of Atlanta 's first Negro high school . The paternal grandfather is something else again , a poor , violent , and illiterate farmer who tried to find refuge from reality in drinking . He clearly had a great influence on the formation of the character of Martin , Sr. , who determined , very early , to be as unlike his father as possible . Martin , Sr. came to Atlanta in 1916 , a raw , strapping country boy , determined , in the classic American tradition , to rise above his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Deep South of 1916 , but he was , luckily , too young for the Army , and prices and wages rose during the war , and his improvident father had taught him the value of thrift . So he got his start . He studied in evening school , entered Atlanta 's Morehouse College in 1925 , and graduated in June of 1930 , more than a year after Martin was born . ( There are two other children , an older girl who now teaches at Spelman College , and a younger boy , pastor of a church in Noonan , Georgia . ) By this time , Martin , Sr. had become a preacher , and was pastor of two small churches ; and at about this time , his father-in-law asked him to become the assistant pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church , which he did . His children have never known poverty , and Martin , Sr. is understandably very proud of this , " My prayer , " he told me , " was always : Lord , grant that my children will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't , they have n't , the prayers certainly did no harm . But one can not help feeling that a person as single-minded and determined as the elder Reverend King clearly is would have accomplished anything he set his hand to , anyway . " I equipped myself to give them the comforts of life , " he says . " Not to waste , not to keep up with the Joneses , but just to be comfortable . We 've never lived in a rented house ? and never ridden too long in a car on which payment was due . " He is naturally very proud of Martin , Jr . but . he claims to be not at all surprised . " He sacrificed to make himself ready " ? ready , that is , for a trial , or a series of trials , which might have been the undoing of a lesser man . Yet , though he is not surprised at the extraordinary nature of his son 's eminence , he was surprised when , at college , Martin decided that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become a doctor or a lawyer because he always spoke of these professions as though he aspired to them . As he had ; and since , as I have said , King is far from garrulous on the subject of his interior life , it is somewhat difficult to know what led him to make this switch . He had already taken premedical and law courses . But he had been raised by a minister , an extremely strong-minded one at that , and in an extraordinarily peaceful and protected way . " Never , " says his father , " has Martin known a fuss or a fight or a strike-back in the home . " On the other hand , there are some things from which no Negro can really be protected , for which he can only be prepared ; and Martin , Sr. was more successful than most fathers in accomplishing this strenuous and delicate task . " I have never believed , " he says , " that anybody was better than I. " That this is true would seem to be proved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around fighting with himself , like we all did . " Here , speculation is really on very marshy ground , for the father must certainly have fought in himself some of the battles from which young Martin was protected . We have only to consider the era , especially in the South , to realize that this must be true . And it must have demanded great steadiness of mind , as well as great love , to hide so successfully from his children the evidence of these battles . And , since salvation , humanly speaking , is a two-way street , I suggest that , if the father saved the children , it was , almost equally , the children who saved him . It would seem that he was able , with rare success , to project onto his children , or at least onto one of them , a sense of life as he himself would have liked to live it , and somehow made real in their personalities principles on which he himself must often have found it extremely dangerous and difficult to act . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the admirers and detractors of his son , and I shall , alas , shortly have more to say concerning his generation ; but I do not think that the enormous achievement sketched above can possibly be taken away from him . Again , young Martin 's decision to become a minister has everything to do with his temperament , for he seems always to have been characterized by his striking mixture of steadiness and peace . He apparently did the normal amount of crying in his childhood , for I am told that his grandmother " could n't stand to see it . " But he seems to have done very little complaining ; when he was spanked , " he just stood there and took it " ; he seems to have been incapable of carrying grudges ; and when he was attacked , he did not strike back . From King 's own account , I can only guess that this decision was aided by the fact that , at Monhouse College , he was asked to lead the devotions . The relationship thus established between himself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between himself and God . seemed to work for him as no other had . Also . I think it is of the utmost importance to realize that King loves the South ; many Negroes do . The ministry seems to afford him the best possible vehicle for the expression of that love . At that time in his life , he was discovering " the beauty of the South " ; he sensed in the people " a new determination " ; and he felt that there was a need for " a new , courageous witness . " But it could not have occurred to him , of course , that he would be , and in such an unprecedented fashion , that witness . When Coretta King ? then Coretta Scott ? met him in Boston . where he was attending Boston University and she was studying at the New England Conservatory of Music , she found him an earnest , somewhat too carefully dressed young man . He had gone from Morehouse to Crozer Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania ; the latter institution was interracial , which may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fighting at that time to free himself from all the stereotypes of the Negro , an endeavor which does not leave much room for spontaneity . Both he and Coretta were rather lonely in Boston , and for similar reasons . They were both very distinguished and promising young people , which means that they were also tense , self-conscious , and insecure . They were inevitably cut off from the bulk of the Negro community and their role among whites had to be somewhat ambiguous , for they were not being judged merely as themselves ? or , anyway , they could scarcely afford to think so . They were responsible for the good name of all the Negro people . FEROCIOUS FORMALITIES C O R E T T A had perhaps had more experience than Martin in this role . The more I spoke to her , the more l realized how her story illuminates that of her husband . She had come from Lincoln High in Marion , Alabama , to Antioch College in Ohio , part of one of the earliest groups of Negro students accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an experiment , and though she took it very well and can laugh about it now , she certainly must have had her  | share of exasperated and lonely moments . The social mobility of a Negro girl , especially in such a setting , is even more severely circumscribed than that of a Negro male , and any lapse or error on her part is far more dangerous . From Antioch , Coretta eventually came to Boston on a scholarship and by this time a certain hoydenish , tomboy quality in her had begun , apparently . to be confirmed . The atmosphere at Antioch had been entirely informal , which pleased Coretta ; I gather that at this time in her Tile she was usually to be seen in sweaters , slacks , and scarves . It was a ferociously formal young man and a ferociously informal young girl who finally got together in Boston . Martin immediately saw through Coretta 's disguise , and informed her on their first or second meeting that she had all the qualities he wanted in a wile . Coretta 's understandable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was checked by the rather frightening suspicion that he meant it ; if he had not meant it , he would not have said it . But a great deal had been interested in Coretta 's career as a singer , and she did not feel that she had the right to fail all the people who had done so much to help her . " And I 'd certainly never intended to marry a minister . It was true that he did n't seem like any of the ministers I 'd met , but ? still ? I thought of how circumscribed my life might become . " By circumscribed , she meant dull ; she could not possibly have been more mistaken . What had really happened , in Coretta 's case , as in so many others , was that life had simply refused to recognize her private timetable . She had always intended to marry , but tidily , possibhmeeting her husband at the end of a triumphant concert tour . However , here he was now , exasperatingly early , and she had to rearrange herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June 18 , 1953 . By now , naturally , it is she whom Martin sometimes accuses of thinking too much about clothes . " People who are doing something do n't have time to be worried about all that , " he has informed her . Well , he certainly ought to know . Coretta King told me that from the time she reached Boston and all during Martin 's courtship , and her own indecision , she yet could not rid herself of a feeling that all that was happening had been , somehow , preordained . And one does get an impression , until this point in the King story at least , that inexorable forces which none of us really know anything about were shaping and preparing him for that fateful day in Montgomery . Everything that he will need has been delivered , so to speak , and is waiting to be used . Everything , including the principle of nonviolence . It was in 1950 that Dr. Mordecai W. Johnson of Howard University visited India . King heard one of the speeches Johnson made on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King became interested in Gandhi as a figure , and in nonviolence as a way of life . Later , in 1957 , he would visit India himself . But , so far , of course , we are speaking after the tact . Plans and patterns are always more easily discernible then . This is not so when we try to deal with the present , or attempt speculations about the future . THE MONSTER CREATURE IMMDI AT E L Y after the failure , last June , of Montgomery 's case against him , King returned to Atlanta . I entered , late , on a Sunday morning , the packed Ebenezer Baptist Church . and King was already speaking . He did not look any older , and yet there was a new note of anguish in his voice . He was speaking ol his trial . He described the torment , the spiritual state of people who are committed to a wrong , knowing that it is wrong . He made the trials of these white people far more vivid than anything he himself might have endured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terror ; and , therefore , if community was ever to be achieved , these people . the potential destroyers of the person , must not be hated . It was a terrible plea ? to the people ; and it was a prayer . In Varieties of Religious Experience , William James speaks of vastation ? of being , as opposed to merely regarding , the monstrous creature which came to him in a vision . It seemed to me , though indeed I may be wrong , that something like this had happened to young Martin Luther ? that he had looked on evil a long , hard , lonely time . For evil is in the world : it may be in the world to stay . No creed and no dogma are proof against it , and indeed no person is ; it is always the naked person , alone , who , over and over and over again , must wrest his salvation from these black jaws . Perhaps young Martin was finding a new and more somber meaning in the command : " Overcome evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to overcome evil is to eradicate it . King spoke more candidly than I had ever heard him speak before , of his bitterly assaulted pride , of his shame , when he found himself accused , before all the world , of having used and betrayed the people of Montgomery by stealing the money they had entrusted to him . " I knew  | it was n't true ? but who would believe me ? " He had canceled a speaking trip to Chicago , for he felt that he could not face anyone . And he prayed ; he walked up and down in his study , alone . It was borne in on him , finally , that he had no right not to go , no right to hide . " I called the airport and made another reservation and went on to Chicago . " He appeared there , then , as an accused man , and gave us no details of his visit , which did not , in any case , matter . For if he had not been able to face Chicago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have been defeated long before his entrance into that courtroom in Montgomery . UNLUCKY NEGRO LEADERS WHEN 1 saw him the next day in his office , he was very different , kind and attentive , but far away . A meeting of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference was to begin that day , and I think his mind must have been on that . The beleaguered ministers of the Deep South were coming to Atlanta that day in order to discuss the specific situations which confronted them in their particular towns or cities , and King was their leader . All of them had come under immensely greater local pressure because of the student sit-in movement . Inevitably , they were held responsible for it , even though they might very well not have known until reading it in the papers that the students had carried out another demonstration . I do not mean to suggest that there is any question of their support of the students ? they may or may not be responsible for them but they certainly consider themselves responsible to them . But all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He talked about his visit to India and its effect on him . He was hideously struck by the poverty , which he talked about in great detail . He was also much impressed by Nehru , who had , he said , extraordinary qualities of " perception and dedication and courage ? far more than the average American politician . " We talked about the South . " Perhaps 4 or 5 per cent of the people are to be found on either end of the racial scale " ? either actively for or actively against desegregation ; " the rest are passive adherents . The sin of the South is the sin of conformity . " And he feels , as I do , that much of the responsibility for the situation in which we have found ourselves since 1954 is due to the failure of President Eisenhower to make any coherent , any guiding statement concerning the nation 's greatest moral and social problem . But we did not discuss the impending cooTerence which , in any case , he could scarcels have discussed with me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face him now and make his future so problematical . For he could not have discussed these with me , either . That white men find King dangerous is well known . They can say so . But many Negroes also find King dangerous , but can not say so , at leapt not publicly . The reason that the Negroes of whom I speak are trapped in such a stunning silence is that to say what they really feel would be to deny the entire public purpose of their lives . Now , the problem of Negro leadership in this country has always been extremely delicate , dan gerous , and complex . The term itself become : remarkably difficult to define , the moment one realizes that the real role of the Negro leader , in the eyes of the American Republic . was not to make the Negro a first-class citizen but to keep him content as a second-class one . This sounds extremely harsh , but the record bears me out . And this problem , which it was the responsibility of the entire country to face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of them were real leaders and some of them were false . Many of the greatest have scarcely ever been heard of . The role of the genuine leadership , in its own eyes , was to destroy the barriers which prevented Negroes from fully participating in American life , to prepare Negroes for first-class citizenship , while at the same time bringing to hear on the Republic every conceivable pressure to make this status a reality . For this reason , the real leadership was to be found everywhere , in law courts , colleges , churches , hobo camps : on picket lines , freight trains , and chain gangs ; and in jails . Not everyone who was publicized as a leader really was one . And many leaders who would never have dreamed of applying the term to themselves were considered by the Republic ? when it knew of their existence at all ? to be criminals . This is , of course , but the old and universal story of poverty in battle with privilege , but we tend not to think of old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relentlessly parochial land . - The real goal of the Negro leader was nothing less than the total integration of Negroes in all levels of the national life . But this could rarely be stated so baldly ; it often could not he stated at all ; in order to begin Negro education , for example , Booker Washington had found it necessary to state the exact opposite . The reason for this duplicity is that the goal contains the as- sumption that Negroes are to be treated , in all respects , exactly like all other citizens of the Republic . This is an idea which has always had extremely rough going in America . For one thing , it attacked , and attacks , a vast complex of special interests which would lose money and power if the situation of the Negro were to hange . For another , the idea of freedom necessarily carries with it the idea of sexual freedom : the freedom to meet , sleep with , and marry whom one chooses . It would be fascinating , but I am afraid we must postpone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many people appear to be onvinced that Negroes would then immediately meet , sleep with , and marry white women ; who , remarkably enough , are only protected from such undesirable alliances by the majesty and vigilance of the law . The duplicity of the Negro leader was more than matched by the duplicity of the people with whom he had to deal . They , and most of the ountry , felt at the very bottom of their hearts that the Negro was inferior to them and , theretore , merited the treatment that he got . But it was not always politic to say this , either . It certainly could never be said over the bargaining . able , where white and black men met . The Negro leader was there to force from his adversary whatever he could get : new schools , new schoolrooms , new houses , new jobs . He was invested with very little power because the Negro to had so very little power . ( Other Negro leadwere trying to correct that . ) It was not easy to wring concessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after all , no intention of giving their power away . People seldom do give eir power away , forces beyond their control ke their power from them ; and I am afraid at much of the liberal cant about progress is it a sentimental reflection of this implacable ct . ( Liberal cant about love and heroism also obscures , not to say blasphemes , the great love and heroism of many white people . Our racial story would be inconceivably more grim if these pie , in the teeth of the most fantastic odds , if not continue to appear ; but they were almost over , of course , to be found at the bargaining table . ) Whatever concession the Negro leader caraway from the bargaining table was won with the tacit understanding that he , in return , would influence the people he represented in the direction that the people in power wished them to be influenced : Very often , in fact , he did not do this at all , but contrived to delude the white men ( who are , in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had . But very often , too , he deluded himself into believing that the aims of white men in power and the desires of Negroes out of power were the same . It was altogether inevitable , in short , that , by means of the extraordinary tableau I have tried to describe , a class of Negroes should have been created whose loyalty to their class was infinitely greater than their loyalty to the people from whom they had been so cunningly estranged . We must add , for I think it is important , that the Negro leader knew that he , too , was called " nigger " when his back was turned . The great mass of the black people around him were illiterate , demoralized , in want , and incorrigible . It is not hard to see that the Negro leader 's personal and public frustrations would almost inevitably be turned against these people . for their misery , which formed the cornerstone of his peculiar power , was also responsible for his humiliation . And in Harlem , now , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the greatest misery . They do not see this misery , though , because they do not want to see it . They defend themselves against an intolerable reality , which menaces them , by despising the people who are trapped in it . A CLASS VICE T H E criticism , therefore , of the publicized Negro leadership ? which is not , as I have tried to indicate , always the real leadership ? is a criticism leveled , above all , against this class . They are , perhaps , the most unlucky bourgeoisie in the world 's entire history , trapped , as they are , in a no man 's land between black humiliation and white power . They can not move backwards , and they can not move forward , either . One of the greatest vices of the white bourgeoisie on which they have modeled themselves is its reluctance to think , its distrust of the independent mind . Since the Negro bourgeoisie has so many things not to think about , it is positively afflicted with this vice . I should like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the honorable and heroic role played by the NAACP in the national life , and point out to what extent its work has helped create the present ferment . But , for the moment , I shall have to confine my remarks to its organ , The Crisis , because I think it is incontestable that this magazine reveals the state of mind of the Negro bourgeoisie . The Crisis has the most exciting subject matter in the world at its fingertips , and yet manages to be one of the world 's dullest magazines . When the Reverend James  | Lawson ? who was expelled from Vanderbilt University for his sit-in activities ? said this , or something like it , he caused a great storm of ill feeling . But he was quite right to feel as he does about The Crisis , and quite right to say so . And the charge is not answered by referring to the history of the NAACP . Now , to charge The Crisis with dullness may seem to be a very trivial matter . It is not trivial , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to examine what is really happening in the Negro world ? its failure indeed , for that matter , to seize upon what is happening in the world at large . And I have singled it out because this inability is revelatory of the gap which now ominously widens between what we shall now have to call the +:f ciai leadership and the young people who have begun what is nothing less than a moral revolution . It is because of this gap that King finds himself in such a difficult position . The pressures on him are tremendous , and they come from above and below . He lost much moral credit , for example , especially in the eyes of the young , when he allowed Adam Clayton Powell to force the resignation of his ( King 's ) extremely able organizer and lieutenant , Bayard Rustin . Rustin , also , has a long and honorable record as a fighter for Negro rights , and is one of the most penetrating and able men around . The techniques used by Powell ? we will not speculate as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was faced with the choice of defending his organizer , who was also his friend , or agreeing with Powell ; and he chose the latter course . Nor do I know of anyone satisfied with the reasons given for the exclusion of James Lawson from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference . It would seem , certainly , that so able , outspoken , and energetic a man might prove of great value to this organization : why , then , is he not a part of it ? A NEW DIMENSION A N D there are many other questions , all of them ominous , and too many to go into here . But they all come , finally , it seems to me , to this tremendous reality : it is the sons and daughters of the beleaguered bourgeoisie ? supported , in the most extraordinary fashion , by those old , work-worn men and women who were known , only yesterday , as " the country niggers " ? who have begun a revolution in the consciousness of this country which will inexorably destroy nearly all that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people have never believed in the American image of the Negro and have never bargained with the Republic , and now they never will . There is no longer any basis on which to bargain : for the myth of white supremacy is exploding all over the world , from the Congo to New Orleans . Those who have been watched and judged and described for so long are now watching and judging and describing for themselves . And one of the things that this means , to put it far too simply and bluntly. is that the white man on whom the American Negro has modeled himself for so long is vanishing . Because this white man was , himself . very largely a mythical creation : white men have never been , here , what they imagined themselves to be . The liberation of Americans from the racial anguish which has crippled us for so long can only mean , truly , the creation of a new people in this still-new world . But the battle to achieve this has not ended . it has scarcely begun . Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality and the force of his beliefs , has injected a new dimension into our ferocious struggle . He has succeeded , in a way no Negro before him has managed to do , to carry the battle into the individual heart and make its resolution the province of the individual will . He has made it a matter , on both sides of the racial fence , of self-examination ; and has incurred , therefore , the grave responsibility of continuing to lead in the path he has encouraged so many people to follow . How he will do this I do not know , but I do not see how he can possibly avoid a break , at last , with the habits and attitudes , stratagems and fears of the past . No one can read the future , but we do know , as James has put it , that " all futures are rough . " King 's responsibility , and ours , is to that future which is already sending before it so many striking signs and portents . The possibility of liberation which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an overhauling of all that gave us our identity . The Negro who will emerge out of this present struggle ? whoever , indeed , this dark stranger may prove to be ? will not be dependent , in any way at all , on any of the many props and crutches which help form our identity now . And neither will the white man . We will need every ounce of moral stamina we can find . For everything is changing , from our notion of politics to our notion of ourselves , and we are certain , as we begin history 's strangest metamorphosis , to undergo the torment of being forced to surrender far more than we ever realized we had accepted .
