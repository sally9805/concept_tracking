In the U.S. Naval Academy 's hospital in Annapolis last week , a dozen midshipmen who did not seem critically ill were confined to bed and getting intensive care . In mid-February they had begun to feel lethargic . Then they had developed slight fevers , headaches and sore throats . The lymph glands in their necks and armpits swelled . Medical Officer Edward C. Keene was not surprised-he would have been surprised if he had not had a rash of cases . The ailing mids were victims of infectious mononucleosis , a mysterious disease that breaks out about six weeks after infection . And infection most commonly occurs during the Christmas-New Year holidays , when a young man 's fancy is to kiss his girl . <P> One Pleasant Date . Doctors , confronted with a possible case of mononucleosis , often regard it as a mild infection . It is frequently more than that , says Colonel Robert J. Hoagland , who began studying mono in 1946 when he was medical officer at West Point ( where , as at most colleges , the disease is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since his transfer there . <P> Much of the confusion in diagnosing it is largely unnecessary , says Dr. Hoagland : the symptoms of a full-blown case follow a pattern like the midshipmen 's . A blood test alone will neither prove nor disprove mononucleosis , but a blood test in combination with these symptoms is decisive . <P> And the disease is not to be taken lightly : it almost invariably results in inflammation of the liver-though a less dangerous form of hepatitis than the widespread infectious hepatitis or serum hepatitis ( TIME , Nov. 14 ) , which are caused by different viruses . And mono must be carefully doctored and nursed , says Colonel Hoagland , because in a few neglected cases it has caused rupture of the spleen , meningitis or heart block-and death . <P> No laboratory has yet isolated the cause of infectious mononucleosis. but it is universally believed to be a small virus . Probably it stays in its victims ' bodies long after they have recovered , so they become " healthy carriers " and pass it on . The mechanism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Willard Dalrymple , chairman of the American College Health Association 's committee on mono , who has observed 600 cases at Harvard and M.I.T. , scoffs at the kissing theory . But Colonel Hoagland , who knows his West Point cadets , has pinned it down . Among 73 mono patients at West Point , no fewer than 71 had been dating six weeks earlier and had got as far as " deep kissing . " A quick buss on the lips is probably not enough to transmit the virus . <P> Two Weeks in Bed . Mono victims , especially coeds , complain that the disease leaves them weak for months , and keeps recurring . Yet the best current medical opinion is that the severity of the disease depends on the victim 's physical fitness-or unfitness . An athlete in training who is getting plenty of sleep may throw it off as nothing more than a bad cold . But even a well-trained cadet or midshipman , going short of sleep during the holiday social whirl and plunging into a tough round of studies , may be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short of food ( to keep slim ) or of sleep . They usually have the severest , longest-lasting cases .
