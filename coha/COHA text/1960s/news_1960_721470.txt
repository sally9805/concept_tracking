txt UNITED NATIONS , . /V , Y. ; Oct. 6 ? PremierMtrushchevshast lost the ! lrst round of his battle ' to ' trans : form and paralyze the United Nations , but he 's not through yet . He has yet to play his economic card . kle has not terrorized either the , neutral nations or Secretary General Hammarskjold by his brassy tantrums or his political maneuvers , but he can still wage an economic offensive that would be awkward for both Hammarskjold and the U. N. Very little attention has been paid to the finances of the world organization , but its budget is rising steeply with its responsibilities , and Khrushchev has already demonstrated that his Government will refuse to pay for anything in the U. N. it opposes . For example , Moscow has yet to pay its share of the cost of sending a United Nations force into the Middle East four years ago during the Suez crisis . This amounted to $2,721,932 . And while Khrushchev has said nothing about it so far , it can be taken for granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N. military and economic operations in the Congo . These costs are now mounting rapidly . The estimate of the maintenance of the U. N. troops there in this calendar year is $50,000,000 , and for 1961 it is expected to cost between $80,000,000 and $150,000,000 . In addition to this , Secretary General Hammarskjold has called for a Congo economic rehabilitation fund of $100,000,000 , and these special funds , of course , are in addition to the regular assessments for the U. N. itself and its specialized agencies such as the World Health Organization , the Food and Agriculture Organization , the . Inter . national Labor Organization and the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization . Please Remit The cost of maintaining the U. N. is allocated in accordance with its members ' ability to pay . The United States , for example , is assessed 32.5 per cent of the total budgets , but actually pays about 40 per cent when its voluntary contributions are added . Moscow is supposed to pay 13.6 per cent of the budget , and if it refuses to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after it is two years in arrears , there is no way it can be forced to pay or be suspended . Thus it is far too early to proclaim victory over Khrushchev even on his fight against the Secretariat . He can not force Hammarskjold out , but he can refuse to contribute to the cost of the Secretariat , just as lie has refused to help finance troop and economic projects he opposes ; and this could cause considerable difficulty , especially if his example were followed by the other Communist members of the world organization . Even Washington is finding considerable resistance in the Congress to the rising appropriations of the U. N. , and of course the problem is more serious for poorer countries . The United States share of the budget of the U. N. and its specialized agencies last year was $116 , - 051,131 . And this was before the bill came in for the Congo , and before the President went to New York and proposed new and expensive U. N. programs of economic , educational and technical assistance for Africa . Khrushchev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political offensives at the U. N. than he did for his attack on the Secretariat . He may not have the votes to bring Communist China into the General Assembly , but the vote on this issue will be a far better test of the EastWest division within the U. N. than the votes on supporting Secretary General Hammarskjold . Also , Khrushchev is staying on in New York while the leaders of the other most powerful nations are going away . President Eisenhower made two quick trips to New York and then departed . Prime Minister Macmillan of Britain made one brilliant intervention in the general debate and has now gone home . And , of course , President de Gaulle of France did not come at all . When Khrushchev made his first major speech to the General Assembly it is significant that the United States , British and French delegations were all asking the same question : " Who can reply effectively for the West ? " Mr. Macmillan provided a personal answer to this question with a brilliant speech , but now Khrushchev is the last of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remain on the scene . Accordingly , the battle is not over yet . Khrushchev is not the world 's ideal of a good loser , and he can be counted on to use the full economic and political arsenal of communism before he is through .
