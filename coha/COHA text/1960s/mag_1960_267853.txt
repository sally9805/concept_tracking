NBC 's Washington studios were abuzz with crowds on the outside and newsmen and technicians on the inside . At 6:31 Jack Kennedy rolled up in a Pontiac convertible with Brother Bobby and a few aides , swept directly into the TV studio . It was cold ( 64 F. ) ; studio officials meant to keep the temperature low in order to counteract the hot lights that produced beads of perspiration on Nixon 's face during the first telecast . Kennedy allowed as how he would need a sweater if things did n't warm up ; a studio man turned up the thermostat . Then Jack and Bobby walked up to the platform , took turns standing at both speakers ' stands while they gazed at their images on the floor TV monitors . Mindful of the lighting trouble that had befallen his opponent in the first debate , Kennedy noted " all those lights pointing over here " ( at his position ) , and " only one points over there " ( at Nixon 's ) . Muttered he , as technicians scampered to adjust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights in my eyes . " As before , Kennedy disdained any TV makeup . <P> Twenty minutes after Kennedy 's arrival , Richard Nixon 's Government Cadillac pulled up and disgorged the Republican team . Nixon had recently emerged from a Statler-Hilton hotel suite where he spent a few uninterrupted hours of peace and thought . Inside the studio Nixon stepped straight up to the platform , put his wristwatch on his speaker 's stand . He had been made up at home by an expert , and an accompanying lighting expert pronounced NBC 's lights perfectly all right . A few minutes before they went on the air , Kennedy strolled over to the Vice President , and both spoke inaudibly as they shook hands . Moments later , TV monitors in the studio pressroom came alive and focused on Nixon . He was sitting grimly , staring straight ahead , as if to substantiate preshow betting that Nixon had decided to take the gloves off and hit hard . <P> Hit hard he did-and so did Jack Kennedy . Their hour-long slugging match gave the U.S. its best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issues . <P> DOMESTIC ISSUES <P> Both men made telling scores on domestic issues . Jack Kennedy belabored the Eisenhower Administration for failure of moral leadership in civil rights ; Nixon named Democratic Vice Presidential Candidate Lyndon Johnson as a man who voted against and still opposes adequate civil rights legislation. * Kennedy called for economic reform , blasting the Administration 's hardmoney , high-interest-rate policies , accused Ike of turning down needed aid for depressed areas . He defended his celebrated claim that " 17 million Americans go to bed hungry " by shifting to Secretary of Agriculture Benson 's statement that 25 million Americans have inadequate diets . A tax increase in the winter of 1961 , Kennedy said , " under present economic conditions , " would not be " desirable . In fact , it would be deflationary . . . cause a real slowdown in our economy . "
