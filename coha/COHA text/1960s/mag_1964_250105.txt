" There has been a lot of discussion as to whether J. Edgar Hoover should be asked to resign from the FBI after his recent remarks about Martin Luther King and the Warren Report , " wrote Syndicated Columnist Art Buchwald last week . " I can now reveal for the first time why President Johnson ca n't ask J. Edgar Hoover to resign . The reason is J. Edgar Hoover does n't exist . He is a mythical person first thought up by the Reader 's Digest . ' " Buchwald went on to develop his theme : that even the name was a phony , attached over the years to 26 " hired people " who took turns posing as the FBI 's nonexistent chief . <P> As usual , Buchwald was only kidding . But his column , syndicated in 207 newspapers , reaches millions of readers , not all of whom saw through his whimsical jape . Soon newspapers all over were fielding telephone calls from anxious subscribers seeking assurance that there really was a J. Edgar Hoover , or angrily offering to prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought he was just misinformed , " reported the Austin ( Tex . ) Statesman . <P> In Phoenix , a similar avalanche of reader inquiries inspired the Arizona Republic to set the record straight with some whimsy of its own in an editorial entitled , " YES VIRGINIA . . . " * Said the Republic : " Telephones have not stopped ringing as one after another caller has demanded that we either present proof that Hoover does in fact exist or else print a retraction . After a thorough day-long investigation , the Republic is now in a position to report that J. Edgar Hoover does in fact exist and is in the best of health . What our investigators further turned up is the fact that Art Buchwald does not exist . He is a mythical person first thought up by MAD magazine . " <P> <P> * A reference borrowed from an 1897 editorial in the New York Sun , written in response to a letter from a worried eight-year-old girl , assuring her : " Yes , Virginia , there is a Santa Claus .
