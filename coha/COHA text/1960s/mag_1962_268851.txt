In Boston the job will cost $200 million ; the Houston contract will run to $250 million-two of the ripest architectural plums of the year . Both of these projects came from the busy assembly-line drawing boards of one of the most successful and controversial architects in the nation today , Charles Luckman , the onetime boy wonder of the corporate world . <P> Construction contracts were let last week for Boston 's Prudential Center , which will convert a blighted Back Bay railroad yard to the 52-story New England headquarters of the Prudential Insurance Co. , a 1,000-room hotel , a 5,800-seat auditorium , gardens , a skating rink and swimming pool . In Washington this week , NASA will unveil the master plan for its man-in-space research center outside Houston , a complex of 49 buildings , training fields and mock-up lunar landscapes for practice landings . Building begins in May , will finish by late 1964 . <P> Luckman designed them both . Though he is 52 and getting puffy , Chuck Luckman still generates the same showman 's charm that made him president of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and woefully out of a job at 40 ( largely because Lever lost money after Luckman plunged heavily into new products and inventories ) . <P> Champions &; Critics . In architecture as in big business , Luckman has strong champions and critics . The critics grumble that he is more a businessman than an architect . " He is successful , " says one top Chicago architect coolly , " because he produces anonymous architecture in a prescribed time and at the least cost and fuss to his clients . " Luckman denies only the " anonymous " part of that charge . He insists that " I 'm in this business not for security but for satisfaction " Kansas City-born , Luckman was graduated magna cum laude in architecture from the University of Illinois ( ' 31 ) . But Depression pressures pushed him into store-to-store selling . He soon was making news as well as sales . He was credited with discovering Bob Hope for Pepsodent ( someone else did ) . He commissioned the glass-skinned Lever House on Park Avenue , which was worth its weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights to education in the highbrow press , sat on prestigious Government committees , dined with Presidents . <P> When Luckman 's comet burned low in 1950 , he went back to architecture in partnership with a gifted Illinois classmate , Los Angeles Architect William L. Pereira . The two built a substantial list of clients , designed the University of California 's Santa Barbara campus , the U.S. military bases in Spain , the Berlin Hilton hotel and CBS 's Television City in Hollywood . Most of the architecture was frankly Pereira . Luckman wanted to grow bigger and bigger ; Pereira wanted to stay small so that he could personally watch over every project from beginning to end . Each got his wish four years ago , when Luckman bought out Pereira , who set off on his own .
