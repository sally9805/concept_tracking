" Yet we will all die , no matter how we spend our time ; even now we are dying , sloughing off dead cells until , like so many windup dolls , the momentum of life runs down ; and buried in the dirt , we go on living as the uninformed hair and nails , scrounging meals off a liquefying corpse , continue to live and to grow , or so I have read . To die , the active verb , must be no more than another giving birth , You lie , so frightened , quite still , the doctor tells you to relax ( he has seen the performance so often ) on a chill and unfamiliar bed , the damp sheets heavy on your cold legs , waiting for your body to do something that it knows how to do and of which you yourself know nothing .

In a medieval dance of death , the skeletons grin . Does this seem unpleasant ?

" It was apropos of nothing , but how beautifully done . I thought about the line and I figured it out . Of course , the think you know at fifty that you can not make someone twenty years old believe , unless by doing so you make him fifty too , is the simple knowledge that you are really and truly going to die  --  not someday , but soon , in so many days , weeks , or years .

WILL IT BE THERE ? My hand continues to move across the paper ; the momentary crisis is over as the blackness again opens up at my feet .

Do n't talk to me about affections and liking  --  there 's no octane in ' em , although I know as well as you do the light warmth of sitting around the table at breakfast ; cool air wisping in through the open terrace door ; the sun making the white walls , the gold rug , the natural redwood furniture , the bookshelves , the white 72 HOW TO WRITE " NEW YORKER " STORIES dishes on the round table each glow with a soft and independent luminosity ; the color of morning , and the round cheeks of the children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper and telling me the news .

She wanted him punished , and could they have done anything to him if she had lived ? There 's no law against dipping your wife in acid . She had to die so that there would be a murder . Is n't it funny ? He did n't want her to die . Not at all . He wanted her to live and be in pain . The poor , poor girl , taking into account that she may have been a perfect bitch . The poor girl .

" Florence held up her arms and her mouth with a kiss on it and said , " Bye , bye , Papa , " and Aaron said , " Oh look " ; a towhee , a brown bird smaller than a robin , had hopped into the room through the open door to peck at the crumbs under the table . Aaron jumped off his chair and ran around and around the living room in the pale-gold light , after the brown bird flying around and around and finally out , through the door , and we all laughed . There is this happiness that comes from having small children in the house ; it is effortless and lovely  --  but unimportant , a by-product , and irrelevant to the way we go at life and to what the children are working so hard to learn to do well , the simple climate of our lives . Butting and kicking . we rip our way out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; to beat other wills into submission to our own . This is the permeating mood of what we do and are , in the war between children and parents , between brothers and sisters . It is the padded , barred cage for two that marriage is , It is the surly salesgirl and the bullying bus driver ( people you do n't know , feeling you over for soft spots ) , one 's friends who analyze you and each other to ribbons over coffee , the cannibalism , man eating man , that business is , everything that happens in all the stories , and the interactions that are the reason for writing novels that do n't , after all , explain anything . It is why there are world wars and why the UN is so pathetic . We live a war , and the great wars are no more than the excess energy of our ordinary lives frothing up into a community activity  --  like the Little League .

What makes you think that the meaning and purpose of anyone 's life are distant , even a millimeter , a micron , from the life itself ? Idiots drool artificialities about the meaning of life being found in loving . What ! The whole meaning of all that time only found stuffed in the one little hour ? Nothing continues to live unless it has purpose and intention . When we first came to the island to live , Irving , for no great reason , cut down the flowering stem of a century plant . It was a week old , a giant asparagus stalk six feet tall on the pile of debris behind the barn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crazy thing pushed out another ten feet of vertical stalk , thinned out into branches at the top and bloomed its fleshy white blossoms  --  and that was the simple vanity of a mere vegetable ! Our meaning and purpose are here in this single-minded straining to stand and smile up into the face of the sun , our feet balanced on a little rug of soft and submissive necks . Just listen to the tone of whoever speaks to you next . Not admirable , but no one ever said living was  --  only that , aside from living , what is there ? You plead that you are acting in self-defense , and it is true that you 'll get stamped if you do n't watch out , but is that the reason for your own broad boots ?

But does this less than a midget , this insect , know his insignificant state ? To the contrary . He yells and turns red and throws his arms and legs and all but beats his chest until his unstated needs are satisfied . Maybe everything starts from eating , the four-hour necessity of which sends us gulping up and chewing everything and everyone to fill the void around which we are formed . Aaron 's first words were " mama , " " papa , " and " no ! ! " The world and how to beat it as seen from down inside the bars of a crib . Florence added to these " I want , " which , with the addition of any word  --  noun , verb , what-have-you or what-haven't-youbecomes the universal , all-purpose sentence . It is ten o'clock , and I am trying to write . Aaron says to me , " What is your favorite animal , Mama ? " " Little boys , " I say , not looking up . " An animal has four legs , " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mama ? " " A deer , " I mumble , still trying to keep my mind on the work under my hand . " Why is a deer your favorite animal , Mama ? " comes next , and I give up . I am beaten ; simple harassment is the ultimate weapon . It starts in the morning . " I do n't want to get up ! " " I wo n't brush my teeth . " " Do n't wash my face ! " I put plates of scrambled eggs on table . " I hate that " ; and the orange juice and milk get spilled " accidentally " ; and dishes broken and the furniture attacked and the pulling and slapping at each other ; the garden uprooted plant by plant and the continuous questions , not listening to the answers , but looking up at you so sweetly to see how much further they can go before your patience turns on them . and then two hundred and eighty-seven " no 's " later " I wo n't go to bed ! ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I sit down to a calm evening 's reading , and there is more of the same , happily married as we are . 74 I-10W TO WRITE " NEW YORKER " STORIES Guerrilla actions wearing away at your flank . For instance , it 's a small thing , too insignificant to actually fight about , but you would think that with all the magazines that come to the house  --  Consumer Reports , Progressive Architecture , The Engineering News-Record , The New Statesman , Look , The Times Literary Supplement , The New Yorker , Sunset , The New Republic , Landscape ( which is not about gardening ) the Sunday edition of the New York Times  --  without which life would still be incomplete  --  you would think that with all this paper that Iry reads and takes apart and leaves piled up on chairs , the floor , and in the bathroom , you would think he would let me have The Ladies Home Journal when it comes . There is something very pleasant in handling a fresh magazine . I 've told him several times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only magazine I would like to see first , but he grabs it every time ( it 's absolutely ridiculous , is n't it ? ) , and by the time I get it there are orange pits sticking the pages together . It is a small thing and quite unimportant , but of course , I am always annoyed , and there is no reason for it except simple antagonism and the same sort of ripping at you that the children do  --  except that Iry is simply being human , while the children are still learning how to do this , honing their personalities on mine for the full set of fangs and claws they 'll need to get them through kindergarten . They are , however , still new and small , and the world seems very large , so it is very hard work and they get very tired . After tearing and tearing at you in the hope you 'll fall apart in screaming frustration , they creep up on your lap to be comforted and petted , because these are the people who love you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a towel , and hold him while sitting on the closed cover of the toilet .. I tickle him and he wiggles and laughs , and I rub his hair to dry it . And I look at the smooth skin of his cheek and the grave clarity of his gray eyes and think that in fifteen years he will be shaving and I wo n't be able to enclose him in my arms ; he will be a man  --  and a stranger . Even more meaningful , my daughter is myself . I pick her up and press her round warmth to me , and it is as though I am standing and holding another myself in my arms , and if together we make one round shape of completeness , there is equally an intensity of feeling that no man babbling about the " innocence " of mother love admits . There is nothing whatever innocent in us  --  it is ultimate sexuality . A man loves a woman and wants to screw her , but this is only a mutual aggression , a preliminary for a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . Point of view is everything ; men always think the world stops where they do , but there is a purpose to all that rubbing , no less , My complaint is in the extravagance of it all , but then in nature ( in Nature , in the nature of things ) everything is overdone ; we have to eat  --  we want to gorge . To reproduce only a new Irving and myself on the earth , we have enough juice to repopulate it , and there is this enormous sense of responsibility in being a mother . Grace Kelly described it in one of the magazines that came to the house last spring . " Once you are a mother , " she said , " you never have a peaceful night 's sleep the rest of your life . I have terrible nightmares about accidents to my children , like their falling off cliffs . " I know what she means . The children are so sweet and so vulnerable . Their eyes are so clear ; you look into them and see them pierced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needle , perhaps . Their hands are so small and so perfect in the detail of joints and nails and cuticle , and you see the hand cut off at the wrist , and a stump  --  nothing waving on a little arm . These are nightmares , " We must love one another or die . " How inadequate ; so passive ; so masculine ! I love them enough so they can not , will not die , the amputations that life is waiting to inflict on them notwithstanding . To prepare , to protect them , I have found that I can do things I did not know I could do . Still , it has not been easy . I have some strong little nail scissors . They are quite heavy , and I 've had them a long time ; the nails on my big toes are thick , and I also use them on the children . Three weeks ago I trimmed their nails and cut off the top joint of Florence 's fourth finger on her right hand and the tip of Aaron 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joint is a natural point of separation . They cried , and the fingers bled , so I held the children on my lap and comforted them and told them that now they would be all right . I put antiseptic and a bandage on each of them and held them with their hands up high for fifteen minutes so the bleeding would stop . And Florence said , " Mama , my mama . " And Aaron said , " Now will I be all right , Mama ? " I kissed them and they went outside again to play . In the evening I told Iry about the accident . No children have fallen off cliffs in my dreams . If I have dreamed , it has been only of crying . In the darkness it comes in waves and hollows and surrounds and covers me and that crying does not stop . Only that . I can bear it . Next time I will work on their toes .
