When Russia 's Venus 4 capsule suddenly fell silent in the thick Venusian atmosphere last October , Soviet scientists assumed that the spacecraft 's final readings-a temperature of 520 F. and an atmospheric pressure 15 to 22 times greater than Earth's-described conditions on the planet 's surface . Not so , say U.S. Electrical Engineers Arvydas Kliore and Dan Cain . The Venusian at mosphere , they report in the current issue of Journal of Atmospheric Sciences , is much hotter and far more crushing than the Soviets think . On the surface the temperature is actually close to 900 F. , the atmospheric pressure a staggering 75 to 100 times the sea level pressure on Earth . <P> Their own figures , the two Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientists explain , are based not only on data from Venus 4 but also on transmissions from the U.S. spacecraft Mariner 5 which flew past Venus less than two days after the Russian landing . According to JPL , the Russian capsule stopped sending signals when it was 3,774 miles from the center of Venus . But recent measurements by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's radius is only 3,759 miles . That means that at the instant Venus 4 stopped transmitting , it must have been 15 miles above the planet 's surface . The capsule , Kliore and Cain speculate , may have landed on a Venusian mountain three times as high as Mount Everest . Or more likely , it may have gone dead while still floating down through the atmosphere-a victim of electronic heat prostration . To back up their temperature estimate , the JPL men also point out that U.S. radio astronomy measurements and data from Mariner 2 , which bypassed Venus in 1962 , indicate a Venusian surface temperature of at least 800 F. <P> <P> The new findings make it less likely than ever that future space probes will find any kind of life on Venus . A surface compression of 75 atmospheres is as crushing as the pressure of water 2,550 ft. below the ocean 's surface . A temperature of 900 F. is more than enough to melt lead or zinc , or do in any form of life familiar to Earthmen.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
