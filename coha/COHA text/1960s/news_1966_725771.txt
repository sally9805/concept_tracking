txt Washington , Sept. 9-President Johnson faces a showdown with Congress over unbudgeted Viet Nam war costs before it approves the tax changes he proposed to fight inflation , members reported today . The President yesterday asked Congress to suspend the 7 per cent tax credit businesses get for investments in equip . ment and plants , and to suspend the accelerated depreciation schedules for writing off plant and equipment costs . Drastic Action Called Need Many members appeared to agree with Chairman Wilbur D. Mills D. , Ark. of the House ways and means committee who reportedly told the President his tax proposals are " too little and too late . " If Viet Nam war costs are as high as some suspect , they say far more drastic tax action must be taken immediately . Chairman George Mahon D. , Tex. of the House appropriations committee warned Aug. 25 when the House passed the $58,858,003,000 defense department appropriation bill that more money for Viet Nam would be needed quickly . " Nobody knows the exact figure , but it is going to be a tremendous figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President would send Congress a request for more money shortly after Christmas . Mahon said he could only guess the amount , but he ' expected it could range between 5 and 15 billion dollars . Others on Mahon 's committee have said 20 billion dollars may be closer . The President in his tax message said that " further longerrange actions may prove necessary to maintain balanced growth and finance the defense of Viet Nam . " He said he could not make further decisions until Congress completed action on eight remaining appropriations bills , and until the defense department " knows the size " of its Viet Nam spending needs . " Because we can not control or predict these outcomes , " the President said , " we can not blueprint our fiscal measures in the months ahead . But should additional fiscal measures be required to preserve price stability and maintain sound fiscal policies , I will recommend them . " See Delay Past Election These statements were interpreted thruout Congress as saying in effect that Johnson would ask for higher income taxes after the November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have Congress meet after the elections to enact a raise in income taxes . But if this does not come about , members are dead certain a general tax increase is in prospect early next year . Sen. Jacob Javits R. , N. Y. said in a Senate speech this morning that Congress should vote a 7 to 10 per cent acrossthe-hoard increase in income taxes and ignore the President 's request to suspend the investment credit . Sen. William Proxmire D. , Wis. opposed suspension of the investment credit . He said the President " should make a far sharper reduction in federal spending " than he indicated he would in his tax message . Tells Ways to Save " In addition to the President 's feeble economies , " Proxmire said , " I would cut a billion dollars out of the space program , 200 million dollars the administration plans to spend on the supersonic transport airplane , stop all spending on mass transportation , and postpone all federal public works projects , including road building that is under direct Presidential control . " Proxmire reminded Congress that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told the joint Senate-House economics committee last March that suspension of the investment credit " can not have its prime effect for at least a year after Congress acts . " Secretary of the Treasury Henry H. Fowler , who has strongly opposed suspension of the investment credit in appearances before congressional committees this year , has been announced as the first witness in support of the administration bill when House hearings start Monday . Many Ask to Be Heard The ways and means committee began receiving requests early this morning from persons and organizations wanting to be heard on the President 's proposal . An attempt is being made to arrange schedules so that all may be heard next week . If all goes according to plan , the ways and means committee could meet behind closed doors the week of Sept. 18 and write its bill . It might be able to report the bill and obtain clearance from the rules committee for floor debate the next week . Members noted one hitch . Speaker John McCormack D. , Mass. announced at a press conference that he has scheduled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate starting Sept. 27 . He expected the poverty program to occupy the House most of the week . That would leave only Monday , Sept. 26 , or the week-end , when most members have scheduled campaign activities , for the tax bill . Seek Oct. 15 Windup Tax legislation must originate in the House . Both Speaker McCormack and Sen. Mike Mansfield D. , Mont. , the Senate majority leader , have pledged to do their utmost to adjourn Congress by Oct. 15 so that members may go home and campaign for reelection . If the House can not pass the tax bill before Sept. 30 , there will be extremely little time left for the Senate to act . Sen. John Williams R. , Del. served notice today that he would block the finance committee from holding hearings on the tax bill at any time the Senate is in session . It requires the unanimous consent of members of the Senate for a committee to hold hearings while the Senate is in session .               @ @ @ @ @ @
