We do n't want to associate civil rights with this kind of lawlessness . " The basic factor here was deprivations not related to civil rights . This is not essentially a Negro problem  --  this is an American problem . " Sees Red Involvement Asked about possible Communist influence in the rioting , he said : " In any disorder of this magnitude , there is likely to be some Communist involvement . But it 's not likely to be a broadbased motivating factor . " Escorted by six police officers , Dr. King talked to an overflow crowd of 300 Negroes at the Westminster Community Center on 102d Street , in the riot area . As he counseled nonviolence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muslim yelled : " Get out of here , Dr. King ! We do n't want you !

The clergymen said : " As white Christian priests , we accuse the churches of Los Angeles of a disastrous failure to act morally , or provide leadership , in race relations . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppressed Negroes . Their hopelessness , and its causes . are simply not comprehended by people who do not know at first hand the ghetto conditions . " It is distressingly apparent that communication has been , and remains , virtually nonexistent between these people and the white power structure of the city . " The Muslim structure where the exchange of fire took place was Muhammad 's Mosque , at Broadway and 56th Street . the scene of the city 's only other racial clash of recent years . There , on April 27 , 1962 , a melee between Muslims and policemen resulted in the death of one rioter and the serious injury of a dozen rioters and policemen .
