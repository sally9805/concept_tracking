txt President Nixon proposed today a series of apti-inflationary. measures to halt what he described as " a form of economic aggression against the very young and the very old , the poor and the thrifty . " The President , in a brief , general message to Congress that contained no real surprises , called for the maintenance of present taxes and " significant " cuts in the budget for fiscal year 1970 , which begins next July 1 . His revenue proposals followed the line set by the Johnson Administration : continuation of the full 10 per cent surcharge on income taxes and postponement of reductions in telephone and automobile excise taxes . Upward Spiral Continues But an Administration source indicated that the Nixon cuts in spending , which he said would be widely spread , envisioned taking at least $2.7-billion out of the budget offered by the Democrats . Mr. Nixon 's message came amid continued evidence of inflationary pressures . The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported yesterday , for instance , that consumer prices had increased by four-tenths of one per cent last month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month when banks began charging 71/2 per cent to leading borrowers . Also , capital investment by business took a sharp rise . Under orthodox economic principles , the Government hopes that by taking away more money through taxes and by reducing its own spending it can hold back demand and level off the increasing cost of living . Concern for ' Defenseless ' " We are determined to keep faith with America 's wage-earners , farmers and businessmen , " the President said . " We are committed to take every necessary action to protect every American 's savings and real income from further loss to inflation . " At several points in his message , Mr. Nixon stressed his concern with the impact of inflation on " those of modest means . " After referring to the very young , the very old , the poor , and the thrifty , he said : " It is these Americans who arp largely defenseless against the kind of price increases for food , clothing , medicine , housing and education that have swept over the nation in the last few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 18 , and sent to the President a measure approving a $12-billion increase in the national debt . Mr. Nixon was sure to sign the bill . Mr. Nixon had asked that securities owned by Government trust funds be excluded I from consideration in comput- ' ing the national debt , a bookkeeping change that might have made further increases in the ceiling unnecessary in his present term . But Congress Instead voted to increase the " temporary " debt ceiling to $377-billion . The " permanent " ceiling of $365-billion is expected to be exceeded by $2.2-billion on April 15 . The temporary limit will drop back to the permanent level on June 30 , 1970 . That will require the President to . ask Congress for another increase next year . In the anti-inflationary effort outlined by Mr. Nixon in his message today , the Administration has essentially set itself three fields of budget cutting . First , it wants to offset a drop of $1.7-billion in the surplus forecast by the Johnson Administration . The change was attributed to cost increases such as higher interest on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surplus Second , it hopes to increase the budget surplus of $3.4-billion originally set by the Johnson Administration . Senator Everett Dirksen of Illinois , the Senate Republican leader , said the President aimed at doubling the surplus . Another informant described that goal as " a pretty extreme possibility . " And finally , there have been reports that an unofficial review of the Johnson Administration budget has generated requests within the Nixon Administration for a $1-billion spending increase rather than a decrease . This , too , would have to be eliminated . The basic outlines of the President 's program have been reported earlier . The Administration provided little information today about which budget items would be trimmed . Sources said the cuts would come in both the defense and domestic areas and would reflect the new Administration 's priorities . One official said no " arbitrary percentages " were envisioned in effecting the reductions . Series of Amendments There were suggestions that some resigning Government employes would not be replaced and that a " selective " cut in public works programs would be carried out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be " still under consideration . " The specific proposals for cutting are expected to come in a series of budget amendments over the next several weeks . There would be no new budget nor single package of changes . On the revenue side , the Ad-1 ministration expects the surplus to supply about $9.5-billion , the the excise taxes about $500-million , and maintenance of " user charges " such as truck taxes , more than $400-million . Mr. Nixon also promised to submit some tax reform proposals in April . Congressional leaders of both parties said they expected Congress to extend the surtax as requested . Senator Mike Mansfield of Montana , the majority leader , said he favored attaching a spending limitation to the measure , as was done when it was first imposed . In a supplemental request on the current budget , Mr. Nixon asked Congress for a cut of $148.5-million and an increase of $67.2-million for a net reduction in the present fiscal year of $81.3-million . The requests included $4-million to relieve price pressures on softwood lumber and plywood ; $14-million for 500 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief , $20-million for unemployment compensation for Federal workers and former servicemen ; $2.5-million for crime prevention , and $1.4-million to prevent a " massive " migration of screwworms this spring . Of the proposed decrease , $140.7-million reflects miscellaneous savings in the Defense Department .
