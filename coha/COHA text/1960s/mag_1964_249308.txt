Like pond-scrimming beetles , hundreds of speedboats and scows criss crossed the Gulf of Mexico last week carrying men and material to 88 rigs perched off the Louisiana coast . Helicopters whirred overhead , and field offices set up by 20 major oil companies bulged with engineers and geological surveyors . Arcing from the Mississippi Delta westward to the Sabine River and extending seaward 75 miles , Louisiana 's 47 offshore oilfields cover a pool of more than 10 billion bbl . Coastal Louisiana , as a result , has become the world 's busiest offshore oil site . <P> Most Generous . Domestic-oil exploration has changed drastically since the 1956 Suez crisis touched off an any-thing-goes search for more Stateside oil . Renewed imports , tightened state restrictions to guard reserves , and marginal returns from shallow drilling are forcing today 's oilmen to drill deeper and to move into states where allowables-the monthly production quotas imposed by the state-are more generous . Louisiana is not only among the most liberal in quotas , but has the best deep-drill prospects . Though Texas still leads all oil-producing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ output has declined steadily since 1951 . Louisiana four years ago bumped California from second place , last year raised its production another 13% to 521.1 million bbl. - 25% of it in offshore oil . <P> The oil companies that have flocked offshore have to drill down through as much as 300 ft. of water and 16,000 ft. of mud and shale . A single successful well costs as much as $3,000,000 , about six times the cost of a similar dry-land operation . The lease on a giant three-legged drilling platform , such as Kerr-McGee 's Kermac 54 , now jack-legged this week into 180 ft. of water 80 miles from shore , runs to $8,000 a day . Oil companies so far have invested $4.25 billion in offshore operations , recovered $1.75 billion of it . Under such conditions , all but a handful of independents have been frozen out of the play . <P> Even the major companies have found it wise to syndicate offshore . Shell , Humble and Standard of California are the three biggest offshore explorers , but each has entered partnerships besides maintaining a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a syndicate formed by Continental , Atlantic , Tidewater and Cities Service ; since 1953 it has had 300 successful completions in 600 attempts . But C.A.T.C. has also spent $497 million , climbed out of a sea of red only in 1962 . <P> Contested Claims . Both the U.S. Government and the state of Louisiana will profit from the offshore boom , but no one yet knows to what extent . Congress set out to settle the tidelands oil controversy in 1953 by extending state ownership of coastal waters to three miles , beyond which the Government takes the lease and royalty profits . But it neglected to designate a base point for the measurement ( low-tide mark , land mass , mud flats ? ) , and jurisdictional claims are being contested on 20% of the Louisiana tracts . Until the point is determined , contested royalties go into escrow . But the question of ownership scarcely bothers the oil companies , which have settled down for a long haul . To eliminate barge hauling , they have already laid a whole network of pipes on the Gulf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
