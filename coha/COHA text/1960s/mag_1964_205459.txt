RACE : THE HISTORY OF AN IDEA IN AMERICA by Thomas F. Gossett. 512 pages . S.M.U. Press . $6.95 . <P> <P> " Negroes have a very strong and disagreeable odor . They seem to require less sleep . Their love is ardent but it kindles the senses only , not the imagination . In reason they are much inferior to whites ; in imagination , they are dull , tasteless and anomalous . Their griefs are transient . " <P> The words might be those of a Bilbo , a Rankin or any number of rednecks . In fact , they are the considered opinion of the author of the Declaration of Independence , Thomas Jefferson , who thought that " all men are created equal , " except for Negroes . In this painstaking book , Thomas Gossett , English professor at Trinity University in San Antonio , has traced racism to some surprising sources . Racism would not have endured so long , he suggests , if it had not had the wholehearted support of nearly all early American intellectuals . " The frontiersmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians or at least were indifferent to it , " writes Gossett . " The intellectuals were most often equally convinced that the Indians , because of their inherent nature , must ultimately disappear . They were frequently willing to sigh philosophically over the fate of the Indians , but this was an empty gesture . " <P> Falling for Darwin . Racism was rare before the era of colonialism , writes Gossett . People enslaved and oppressed one another , but they seldom justified their action on racial grounds . But in the Victorian age , when white Europeans ruled colored races the world over , racial theories mushroomed . The favorite of these was Social Darwinism , which held that human races evolve like animal species and that the nonwhite races were at the bottom of the evolutionary scale . <P> American intellectuals , whether liberals or conservatives , scientists or creative artists , fell hard for Social Darwinism . Wrote Jack London , the friend of the masses : " Socialism is devised so as to give more strength to these certain kindred favored races so that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lesser , weaker races . " Theodore Roosevelt declared : " The most vicious cowboy has more moral principle than the average Indian . " Poet-Essayist Oliver Wendell Holmes described the Indians as a " sketch in red crayons of a rudimental manhood . The white man hunts him down like the wild beasts of the forest , and so the red-crayon sketch is rubbed out , and the canvas is ready for a picture of manhood a little more like God 's own image . " <P> One " scientific " test after another was devised to prove the inferiority of colored races . First , phrenology , or the study of skulls , was the rage . Enthusiasts claimed that the bigger the brain cavity , the brighter the person . When Negroes and Chinese turned up with huge brains , racists took to measuring noses . The theory was that the lesser races have longer noses-until it was pointed out that Darwin himself had an exceptionally long nose .                   @ @
