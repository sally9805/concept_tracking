" In the entire history of painting in America there has been no more conspicuous example of being the right man in the right place at the right time , " writes Professor Howard Merritt in his introduction to the first major show of the works of Thomas Cole in 20 years . <P> The nation was young , proud and prickly . Proud of its achievements and of its mighty land , but looking for someone , somehow , to confirm it in its pride . It fell to Cole to see and paint the U.S. with a vision of its grandeur that expressed the young nation 's inner vision - of a landscape that need yield pride of place to no other country . <P> Works Undefiled . Cole was the shy and sensitive son of an English immigrant who had set up shop as a wallpaper maker in the bustling new town of Steubenville , Ohio , where he arrived in 1818 . Thomas helped his father with designs , was shown how to paint likenesses by one of the itinerant portrait painters who trudged from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to be a traveling portrait painter himself . Yet as he rested by the side of the road between jobs , he found himself powerfully drawn to the wilderness surrounding him . " These scenes of solitude from which the hand of nature has never been lifted , " he noted , " affect the mind with more deep-toned emotion than aught which the hand of man has touched . Amid them , the consequent associations are of God , the Creator ; they are his undefiled works . " Cole decided to become a landscape painter instead of a portraitist . <P> The right place , as the young Cole quickly realized , was New York , whose prosperous merchants were eager to purchase paintings for their new mansions and whose intellectual community had already fostered the talents of William Cullen Bryant , James Fenimore Cooper and Washington Irving . Nature was in fashion . A speaker exhorted the nascent American Academy of Fine Arts in 1825 : " The genius of your country points you to its stupendous cataracts and its ranging mountains . There , where nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely landscape , and adorn our houses with American prospects and American skies . " Cole may well have listened to this very injunction , having worked his way to New York by this time . During the summer he embarked on what was to be the first of many summer sketching trips up the Hudson River Valley . <P> He saw , with his painter 's eye , a countryside that was indeed romantic , with deep gorges , beetling cliffs , and tumbling torrents . As a professional , Cole rejoiced because it was also a landscape that-unlike the more familiar Alps and the more picturesque Italian ruins-was at the time undiscovered by artists . " No Tivolis , Ternis , Mont Blancs , hackneyed and worn by the daily pencils of hundreds , " he wrote with delight , " but primeval forests and virgin lakes . "
