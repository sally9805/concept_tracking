Though the worsening war in Viet Nam dominated the headlines , there was no respite for Lyndon Johnson from other pressing presidential problems . Last week , the President took time from his worries to name James H. Rowe Jr. , an old friend and political adviser , to head the Citizens Committee for Johnson and Humphrey , a volunteer organization that will drum up support for the President 's reelection , as " Elect A.B.J. " ( Anyone But Johnson ) buttons were being increasingly displayed . The President also told a meeting of state directors of the U.S. Employment Service that the hard-core unemployed must be trained and given jobs so that the U.S. will remain a " bustling , thriving , go-go nation . " <P> Most go-go feature of the week was Johnson 's urban message , which went to Congress while he was at his Texas ranch for a Washington 's Birthday retreat . The message contained an ambitious program to provide 26 million new homes and apartments for low-and middle-income families in the next decade , more than ten times the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs . In hopeful theory at least , the plan should eliminate all substandard housing in the nation . If Congress approves , the construction of 6,000,000 of the homes and apartments would be subsidized directly by the Government for low-income families over the next ten years . In the first year , 300,000 homes would be built , and for the first time , 100,000 needy families would be given a chance to buy the subsidized houses . Private industry would receive Government inducements such as tax write-offs to construct 20 million other houses and apartments . <P> Cities in Crisis . The major aim of the President 's proposals was to induce private industry to assume a larger role in solving the nation 's housing problems , as proposed in a study by a presidential slum-housing commission headed by Industrialist Edgar Kaiser . To that end , he urged the creation of a National Housing Partnership of major firms that are not now in the building industry . Because of its large size , the National Partnership could reduce costs by standardizing construction plans and making massive purchases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for local developments . <P> The President also asked for creation of a National Insurance Development Corporation that would end " redlining " practices , by which insurance companies refuse to insure homes and businesses in potential ghetto riot areas . As well , he requested $1 billion for model cities , a threefold increase over last year , and passage of the Administration 's oft-requested fair-housing law . All told , the multifaceted program would cost taxpayers $2.4 billion for the first year . <P> " Today America 's cities are in crisis , " Johnson warned Congress . He might have been thinking of his own prospects when he added : " There is no time to lose . "
