" The United Nations has added another ring to the Congo circus , " snapped a disgusted Western diplomat in Leopoldville last week . " And its show looks just as ridiculous as what is going on in the Congolese rings . " Many a baffled Congolese would agree . <P> Originally , the U.N . ' s Congo officials had condoned the takeover of power by Colonel Joseph Mobutu , 30 , relieved to have someone try to impose order on the squabbling politicians . Now they were undermining the hapless young soldier . <P> <P> Originally , they had viewed erratic Premier Patrice Lumumba with alarm , closed the Congo 's airports to his men , and refused him access to the radio station to stifle his dangerous demagoguery ; now they seemed resigned to accepting his return to power . Originally , the U.N . had urged Belgian civilian experts ( but not troops ) to stay and help rebuild the Congo ; now they were issuing strident warnings that Belgians were unwelcome . <P> New Alignment . In Leopoldville , Western officials and diplomats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Best guess was that U.N . Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold was reacting to new and compelling pressures . In the face of Nikita Khrushchev 's attack in the General Assembly , the new African nations had rallied to the defense of the U.N . and Hammarskjold himself . But the 70-0 Assembly vote upholding Hammarskjold obscured the fact that many Africans still felt that Lumumba was the legitimate head of the Congolese government . Ghana 's Kwame Nkrumah and Guinea 's Sekou Toure demanded Lumumba 's return for reasons of their own-he is an old pal . But many others argued simply that he was the only man who had won an election . <P> <P> Hammarskjold is known to feel that the entire success of the U.N . in the Congo depends on maintaining solid Afro-Asian support . And by virtue of last month 's U.N . resolution , Africans will soon get an even larger voice in Congo affairs . A clause in the resolution set up a special " conciliation committee " made up largely of Africans , who soon will fly to the Congo . Was Hammarskjold anticipating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only guess . But the words and actions of Hammarskjold 's men in the Congo clearly indicated that new instructions had crossed the Atlantic . <P> <P> All week long , the top aides of U.N . ' s Congo Chief Rajeshwar Dayal of India made it obvious that the U.N . was ready to scrap Mobutu . The nervous colonel , they whispered , had asked Dayal for an apartment in Le Royal , the U.N . ' s headquarters building . He no longer was in control of his army . He was about to flee the city . He was a poor officer . Ignoring the roughhouse tactics of Lumumba 's own gangs , an official report spoke of " the highhanded and illegal activities " of Mobutu 's army , accusing the army of " acts of lawlessness.
