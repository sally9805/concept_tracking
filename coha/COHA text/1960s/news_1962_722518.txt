txt Letters to The Times Letters to The Times To Explain Foreign Policy Humphrey Proposal for SenateHouse Question Period Discussed The writer of the following letter served in the State Department and with H. Field Haviland Jr . has written a work on executive-legislative relationships in the conduct of foreign affairs . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Cabell Phillips ' column in your issue of June 16 reports a suggestion by Senator Humphrey that Congress establish a " question period " to permit State Department officials to " explain " foreign policy to the full membership of the Senate and House as a means of achieving the Legislative-Executive partnership that Secretary of State Rusk has described as essential for the conduct of foreign policy . Because the proposal borrows only one feature from a markedly different system of government , the cabinet government of the parliamentary system , it is unlikely to have the desired effect in the United States . Each element of a governmental system depends on the functioning of the whole , and the question period 's utility in British practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checks and balances are maintained by the separation of powers . In Britain the members of the Government who answer questions not only conduct foreign policy but also wield political power by virtue of election to Parliament . The Cabinet is drawn from the majority party and is collectively responsible to Parliament . The Opposition 's shadow cabinet is prepared to assume authority should its assault on the Government be successful . Political Influence In contrast , State Department officials and Cabinet members do not hold seats in the House or Senate ( the " Club " ) and have none of the political influence gained by election to public office . They serve solely at the pleasure of the President , who alone is responsible both to Congress and the electorate for foreign policy . Inevitably there is a limit to what appointed Cabinet members and Government officials can do under these circumstances to persuade skeptical Congressmen and Senators to support foreign policies which of ten seem unwelcome and expensive to their constituents . Our governmental system has better remedies for the improvement of foreign policy , including most particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Congress . The President 's foreign policy will be enacted if he has the requisite popular support so that Congressmen and Senators challenge him only at their peril and if the Congressional policy committees have had their say in shaping it . No amount of institutional tinkering can replace these essential ingredients . Admittedly , however , Presidents are not always strong , and Congress now influences foreign affairs in a manner unanticipated by the Founding Fathers . House-Senate Link Under t these circumstances the foreign policy committees of the House and Senate form a vital link between the Legislative and Executive branches . Great care would have to be taken , therefore , to insure that a " question period " involving a confrontation of all members of Congress and State Department and other executive officials would not dangerously weaken the authority of these committtees . If innovation is necessary to increase communication between the two branches , it might be wise to establish on an informal basis a joint Legislative-Executive advisory committee on foreign policy , a device that was used successfully by Secretary Hull . The membership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Influence foreign affairs . The result was agreement between the leadership of both branches of government that the United States must abandon its pre-war policy of neutrality and isolation . DANIEL S. CHEEVER . Wareham , Mass. , July 4 , 1962 . United Germany Feared To THE EDITOR OF THE Ncw YORK TIMES : It is reported that Bundy , Special Assistant to the President , has stated that the reunification of Germany is the keystone of our foreign policy . This seems an incredible piece of folly . Germany has brought two catastrophic world wars upon the rest of us . There is a great deal of evidence that the poison of nazism is far from dead there ; in fact , there are many signs of a resurgence of German arrogance . It is common talk that West Germany is attempting to dominate the Common Market . East Germany is impoverished , suffering without recourse under a very strict occupation . Somehow , this seems exceedingly appropriate ; it is only inequitable that it should be East Germany alone , and not West Germany too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general repentance , shame and change of heart among the Germans for their country 's recent deeds , I would not write this . Unfortunately , those who are ashamed seem to be a small minority . I have heard of more evidence of shame in East Germany than in the West . So long as most Germans are willing to justify their country 's past and presumably willing to try it all again if opportunity should develop ? then reunification should be prevented at all costs .

Stockpiling Secrecy Denied Order to Purchase Lead and Zinc Declared Given Wide Publicity To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your June 26 editorial states that the Senate subcommittee in its investigation of the Government 's stockpiling program " has uncovered a dismaying example of misuse of military secrecy to conceal policies expensive to the taxpayers and alien to any proper consideration of national defense . " I am certain that your newspaper files will bear me out that there was no " secrecy " or concealment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On Aug. 23 , 1954 , James C. Hagerty , press secretary to President Eisenhower , issued a news release to the daily and trade press stating that the President had " outlined an expanded stockpiling program for strengthening the lead and zinc industry as an integral part of the nation 's defense mobilization base . The President took this action in lieu of accepting the recommendations of the United States Tariff Commission for an increase in the duty on imports of these two metals . " Eisenhower Directive Included in Mr. Hagerty 's press release was a copy of the letter that President Eisenhower had written to Chairman Millikin of the Senate Finance Committee and to Chairman Reed of the House Ways and Means Committee in which he stated that he had directed the Office of Defense Mobilization to purchase 200,000 tons of . newly mined domestic lead and 300,000 tons of newly mined domestic zinc at market prices for the long-term stockpile program in order to strengthen and protect the domestic mobilization base for these metals . The above release was given wide publicity in the daily and trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed . Consequently , it is erroneous for your editorial to state that " The effect of these policies ? instituted without knowledge of Congress or the public  --  was to turn the strategic stockpile of lead and zinc into a mechanism for price supports . " Whether the Government 's policy was right or wrong is a moot question and it would take up too much of your valuable space to argue it . The primary purpose of this letter is to set the record straight . Thus far Senator Symington 's committee has not " uncovered " any startling facts . The committee simply has been reviewing facts that are already well known . JOSEPH ZIMM LAN A N. New York , June 27 , 1962 . Locking School Yards To THE EDITOR OF THE'NEW YORK TIMES : The Board of Education can help curb the traditional upsurge in juvenile delinquency during the summer months by padlocking all public school yards after dark to prevent these areas from being used for night-time rendezvous for rowdy and destructive teen-agers . Last summer there were repeated incidents of roistering teen-age gangs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to step in to break up all-night carousing by youths who caused considerable disturbance in the community and costly damage to school property . SOLOMON Z. FERZIGER . Brooklyn , July 5 , 1962 . Tax Cut in 1962 Urged To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Whether to put through a tax cut this year or in 1963 is no longer the question . Since the objective of the tax cut is to spur spending , and since it is foregone that the tax cut in any event will be effective in 1963 , will not the effect of deferring it help to manufacture an economic slowdown in 1962 ? JOEL S. HARTMAN . Fire Island , L. I. , July 4 , 1962 . For Varied School Prayer Individual Expression of Faith by Pupils Proposed To THE EDITOR or THE NEW YORK TIME : I am genuinely surprised at the furor created by the Supreme Court 's decision on prayer in the schools . It seems to be rather startling proof of the thesis Will Herberg has been developing : that we are all supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life , not because we have a faith  --  or faiths ? we hold deeply . What man of faith really wants the expression of his faith reduced to as inoffensive a pattern as can be dreamed up by pressure-conscious school administrators and imposed on teachers and pupils of all faiths and all degrees of faith , fervent and flaccid ? The Regents ' prayer has precisely the kind of innocuous sterility that seems designed to prevent a child from asking the questions we of the church hope he will ask . It avoids the warm and evocative language of our rich heritage of prayer ; consciously or unconsciously it seems designed to promote that empty and conformist " religion-in-general " that requires vs to be " religious , " but makes religion devoid of any content beyond the polite acknowledgment that we have a Creator . Shared Experience Surely even the Regents can be more creative than this . In our pluralistic culture , where God has spoken to so many persons and groups in such wonderfully diverse ways , if we want some real expressions of faith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the parents ? Why not make the open. , ing prayer an assignment in which each day a different child brings from his home  --  or his clergyman ? a prayer that is expressive of how his particular tradition of faith speaks to God in praise and petition ? And if parents have no tradition of faith , they could equip their little emissary with a quotation from " Invictus " or John Dewey or Zen Buddhism or Nick Kenny  --  at least parents might be pushed to give some thought to what they do believe , and how they are communicating it to their children . The opening prayer could then be a treat rather than a treatment , and a shared educational experience rather than a ritual . And so far as our Americanism is concerned , it would be far more expressive and supportive of the real faith of America than the schoolmen 's arbitrary decision for all of us as to what it is we believe in common . Maybe this would be unconstitutional too , though I do n't see why . If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think up something else , if we 're really serious about testifying to a basic faith and not just trying to give our children one more badge of conformity to wear .

Aid for Commuters To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The New York Central has announced a fare increase , while the Long Island Rail Road has announced a fare rise for Suffolk County . With each and every fare increase these railroads have lost riders . Those who remain bear the added burden of further increases . Meanwhile these railroads have reduced the number of maintenance men . The result is more cars on the highways , more congestion and traffic tie-ups in the city . With the rapid build-up of Suffolk County and its counterpart in Westchester and surrounding counties , travel to the city by automobile will become a nightmare . New highways will become a must , resulting in increasing taxes . However , New York City can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking must be the order of the day . The metropolitan area , at least thirty miles from the core of New York City , must be developed into a mass and rapid transit system . One could then go from Long Island to Westchester or New Jersey without those time-wasting changes , and at fares within the reach of all . Why then , the delay ? Rockefeller has refused to treat the problem as a New York State problem but has insisted that it be treated regionally . The hard core is in Long Island and Westchester . The Port Authority could take over the L. I. R. R. and the New York Central and New Haven operating in New York . These three railroads could be hooked up with the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad and the New York Transit System . We can not wait a moment longer . A new authority or the Port Authority must take over and operate all transit lines . NATHAN M. KLEIN . New York , July 1 , 1962.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
