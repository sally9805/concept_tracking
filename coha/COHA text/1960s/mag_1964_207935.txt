Somehow or other , Red Chinese Premier Chou En-lai could not bring himself to leave Moscow . Perhaps it was the tonic weather-snow flurries and freezing temperatures . Maybe it was the charm of his hosts , burr-browed <P> Leonid Brezhnev and cozy , cadaverous Aleksei Kosygin . More probably , Chou , who was closeted with B. &; K. at least once a day for most of last week , felt he was getting somewhere with his Russian adversaries-not fast but fast enough . After all , Peking 's great enemy , Nikita Khrushchev , had been sacrificed ; now both sides could make at least limited concessions . <P> Token Aid . According to rumors filtering out of the Kremlin sessions , Chou had finally agreed to a conference of Communist parties . But the meeting , originally called by Khrushchev for Dec. 15 , would now not take place until next spring , after a series of preliminary talks between Russian and Chinese ideologues . And instead of reading Peking out of the Communist movement , as Khrushchev had intended , the conclave will undoubtedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chinese agreement to attend the meeting , however modified , there seemed to be at least token resumption of Russian aid to the Chinese . Tass reported that a 20,000-kw. turbine , built by the Russians for a Chinese hydroelectric project , would soon be delivered ; Izvestia ran a photo of a Russian engineer supervising pro-Peking North Koreans building a technical school . <P> Russia and China evidently also agreed to stop calling each other dirty names . B. &; K. even began patching up relations with Albania , Red China 's vociferous ally in Europe , whose propagandists have called Khrushchev 's followers " veritable criminals and sinister schemers . " Radio Moscow beamed a message of good will to Tirana , praising Albania 's " sovereignty and position in the world " and reiterating faith in the Soviet Union 's " sublime internationalist duty " of aiding all fraternal parties . But the Albanians , cocky as always , refused to end their " open ideological war " on Khrushchevian revisionism . <P> Wary Hope . Western observers watched hawklike for signs of uncordiality between the Russians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the conclusion was widespread that the talks had " tailed . " Actually , after years of bitterness , they could hardly have " succeeded " in one week , and the significant fact remains that they took place at all . <P> The basic differences between Russia and Red China certainly could not be talked away , as a Pravda editorial on the day of Chou 's departure indicated . Said Pravda : " The Soviet Union is firmly against all plans designed to heat up the international atmosphere . " Clearly , Moscow was not ready to buy Peking 's hard line-at least for the moment . But by the time Chou finished his long goodbye and flew home to Peking , a Sino-Soviet dialogue had been established for the first time in 16 months . The olive branch had been offered to all warring parties in the Communist movement , and the acute embarrassment brought about by Khrushchev 's boorish intransigence had been transmuted into a glow of wary hope . How healing this might be for Communist prestige with the " nonaligned " was illustrated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
