How long does it take a lesser Nazi to live down his party activities ? Does what he did 23 years ago make his life a permanent open book ? Or does the passage of time entitle him to the normal citizen 's right of privacy ? The recent case of one such West German citizen may well have answered all these questions . <P> Back in 1943 , when bomb-torn Berlin started evacuating pregnant women to his East Prussian hospital , Dr. Emil Martens recklessly remarked to a colleague and fellow Nazi that Germany must be losing the war . The colleague . <P> Dr. Ernst Klingsiek , scribbled Martens ' words on a prescription pad - words that a Nazi judge soon called " worth five death sentences . " Condemned to the guillotine . Martens spent a year in prison , mostly in chains , until his dossier was deliberately lost by a Nazi official who happened to be one of his ex-patients . Because officials dared not kill him without proper papers , Martens survived . <P> In 1962 , a West Berlin TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts to stamp out what President Theodore Heuss had called West Germany 's " unovercome " Nazi past . Dr. Martens , now a West Berlin surgeon of 71 , was shown telling how he almost lost his head . Then came readily identifiable shots of Dr. Klingsiek , now a prosperous Herford physician , driving home in his Mercedes-Benz to what a Frankfurt newspaper later called his " luxurious villa . " With out actually naming " this main prosecution witness " against Martens , the commentator said ironically : " As you can see , he is doing well . " <P> Pain &; Suffering . Klingsiek sued the TV station for allegedly damaging his practice . He cited West Germany 's privacy law , which bars any publication of a person 's picture without his permission , unless he is " a personage of contemporary history . " Two lower courts said he was just that . But a higher federal court has just upheld Klingsiek , ruling that the TV station " perhaps " could have complied with the privacy law by only one method - showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , insisted the court , Klingsiek " did not denounce Dr. Martens and did not tell untruths . " Though his practice itself was not provably damaged , Klingsiek was entitled at least to cash compensation for " pain and suffering , " the amount to be decided later . <P> Klingsiek 's victory is likely to benefit many another ex-Nazi . Sentenced to 14 years in 1965 , for example , Auschwitz Adjutant Robert Mulka was sprung for health reasons five months later . In a widely published picture , Mulka was recently shown puttering in his Hamburg garden . Since the picture was sneaked without his permission , Mulka may feel that he now has a good privacy case . On the other hand , the statute of limitations has not run out on crimes committed by still uncaught Nazis . If and when they are found , the press may be entitled to publish their pictures on the theory that they are still public figures .
