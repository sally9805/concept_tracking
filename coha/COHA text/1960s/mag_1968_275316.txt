KEEP WASHINGTON GREEN , urge the ubiquitous signs on trash cans and along highways in Washington State , and the supporters of Candidate Richard A. C. Greene wanted to get some extra mileage out of them by adding an extra E. Greene said no , but that may be his only restraint . The Republican candidate for state lands commissioner-who does not even live in Washington-campaigns on a motto of " Land and Order " and vows , if elected , to " fearlessly commission the land . " He calls his opponent , Democratic Incumbent Bert Cole , " simply much too good " for the $20,000-a-year job , and runs for his office by running away . <P> From Honolulu , where Greene teaches Latin and Greek at the University of Hawaii , he has tickled the Washington electorate with a zany campaign that so far has cost him little more than $200 , the filing fee . His wry humor , propagated in press releases , has gained him far more attention than he would have got in a costlier conventional campaign . A mustachioed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 30 , says he was born in Crete , III. , the " son of a well-known Cretin . " He lived in Washington only from 1964 to 1967 , and he entered politics because of his deep concern about proper land use . " Land should be used , " he says , " gently but firmly . " <P> His philosophy is " Archconservationist " and his politics " Temporary Republican . " He did not cast his primary ballot , keeping it instead as a " rare souvenir . " Yet he won nomination with 88,500 votes , beating three other Republicans , among them an Indian chief . Then he issued his grand manifesto , including a plank on Indian fishing rights . Each fisherman 's limit is four Indians : <P> " Any Indian under 5 ft. 1 in. must be thrown back . " <P> Greene 's principal goal is to make a wilderness recreational area out of the present Boeing Aircraft plant near Seattle . He would cede all of eastern Washington , " including the fearful town of Yakima , " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says he , " I 'd invade . It 's high time Washington had a foreign policy anyway . " If three-term Commissioner Cole defeats him , Candidate Greene threatens to consider " capping my teeth " to become photogenic , " and running for Governor . " If he is victorious , he promises to serve , provided that someone can be persuaded to teach his classes for him . But first , he would demand a recount.
