The dimensions of Lyndon Johnson 's victory were staggering . He won every one of the East 's 142 electoral votes , becoming the first Democratic President ever to carry Vermont , the first since 1912 to win Maine . He made a clean sweep of the Midwest , the Mountain and Border States , the West Coast , appeared to have lost only Arizona in the Southwest . Only in the South did Barry Goldwater score a breakthrough , capturing Alabama , Georgia , Louisiana , Mississippi and South Carolina . Remarkably , the pattern of Democrat Johnson 's victory was strikingly similar to Republican Dwight Eisen- hower 's in 1956-only with the party loyalties reversed . <P> The Clingers . After a numbingly dull campaign , election night promised to be almost as dreary . As soon as the first returns trickled in from Kentucky , Indiana and Ohio at around 7 p.m . ( E.S.T. ) , it became clear that Lyndon was headed for a big victory . The only question was : How big ? By 9 p.m. , when Vermont had plopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson the winner , the answer became obvious : very , very big . In fact , TV 's impatient forecasters were projecting final results with almost impudent haste : CBS suavely announced Bobby Kennedy 's victory over Ken Keating in New York with no votes showing at all . <P> Johnson 's electoral margin of 486 to 52 votes ( assuming he loses Arizona 's five ) fell short of Franklin Roosevelt 's record 523-to-8 victory over Alf Landon in 1936 , but it was the second best in history . Moreover , when the final returns are tabulated , Johnson seems certain to be credited with the greatest popular-vote margin in U.S. history - some 61% of the record 70 mil- lion votes cast , and a plurality of some 15 million votes . In 1936 , F.D.R. won 60.8% of the vote and had an 11,078,204-vote plurality . <P> By themselves , the statistics were impressive enough . But even more impressive was what they meant to coattailclinging Democratic candidates for Congress , governorships and state legislatures . Only ticket splitting of incredible proportions saved moderate Repub licans such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Washington from defeat ; despite considerable splitting , New York 's Ken Keating , Illinois ' Chuck Percy , Oklahoma 's Bud Wilkinson went down . In the Senate , Democrats were assured of retaining their lopsided ma- jority of 66 to 34. or even of increasing it . Thanks to Lyndon 's sturdy coattails . Democratic gubernatorial candidates won in Indiana and West Virginia . <P> Cashing the Checks . " I want the mandate of this election to be written strong and clear , " said the President , " so that none will mistake the meaning . " As far as figures are concerned , the mandate could hardly have been written more clearly . But since the figures meant anti-Goldwater as much as pro-Johnson , carrying out the mandate will not follow automatically .
