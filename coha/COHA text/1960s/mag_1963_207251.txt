Potential investors poured into the convention of the National Institute of Dry-cleaning two years ago , clamoring to find out about a new " wonder business " that was virtually guaranteed to coin profits while they went fishing . Last week in Washington , the institute met again , and this time it was hard to hear a good word said for the business of coin-operated dry cleaning shops . In the two years between the two gatherings , the coin-op industry blossomed into a $120 million-a-year business with 7,300 shops across the U.S. But coin-ops have made more owners miserable than millionaires . <P> Not for Amateurs . Coin-operated dry-cleaning machines look and operate much like coin-operated laundry machines . <P> <P> Promising to clean an 8-lb. load of clothes for $1.50 to $2 , they were expected to be just as successful . The Norge division of Chicago 's Borg Warner Corp . got into the market early and now has 50% of it . Soon 32 other firms followed-including G.M. 's Frigidaire , Whirlpool , Westinghouse , Philco-and the competition was on . Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to investors who swallowed the high-powered promises of " profits while you sleep . " Hard-talking salesmen urged investors to take out 90% loans on equipment worth up to $100,000 . Many cities were quickly swamped with coin-ops ; Denver at one point had 1,800 machines vying for business that 500 could have handled . <P> <P> Drycleaning even by machine turned out to be no business for beginners . The plumbers , insurancemen , and merchants who set up shops found that almost every fabric posed a different cleaning problem and that customers expected them to take out spots and stains just like the more expensive professionals , whose drycleaning process takes 14 separate steps . Coin-op cleaning proved to be better suited for such bulky items as blankets and draperies than for men 's suits and outerwear . Fulltime attendants ( often required by local laws ) sent up labor costs . Electric bills were high , and machines frequently proved unreliable . Clothes often came out smelling like sulphur . Many began to echo the wry dismay of Irwin Gott , a Houston **25;14399;TOOLONG : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it just turned out that way . " <P> Little Extras . When coin-ops first started , the talk was that they would soon put professional drycleaners out of business . Something quite different is happening . To attract customers , the successful coin-ops have had to expand their operations into spotting , pressing and other services , thus are becoming somewhat professional themselves . Many professionals , having lost some business to the coin-ops , have turned to selling coin-op-type service as a sideline , for cleaning materials from around the house and old clothes that do not need pressing . The general feeling at last week 's convention was that there is a continuing place for coin-ops , but that the most successful will probably be managed by professional cleaners in big operations that put coin laundry and coin drycleaning under the same roof with a full line of professional drycleaning.
