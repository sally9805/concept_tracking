" A most confusing-and most ' disturbing-presidential primary , " said the New York Times . " You might as well be your own expert , " said Scripps-Howard 's Houston Press . These comments seemed a far cry from the usual confident election postmortems . But then , New Hampshire was no ordinary election ; its results incited numerous misgivings and even more contradictions in the nation 's press . <P> To the Detroit News , the message from New England seemed clear : " A triumph for a man who looks like a President , who is and has been deeply involved in the critical fight against the Communists , and who offers the Republicans an attractive alternative to Sena tor Barry Goldwater and Governor Nelson Rockefeller . " But in the same city , the Detroit Free Press took quite an opposite view . " Here he is again , " said the Free Press 's political columnist , Judd Arnett , " the most successful political failure of our times , a sort of Harold Stassen with glamour , riding on a wave of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the snowbound burghers of New Hampshire . They must have voted for Henry Cabot for kicks . " <P> <P> That sort of talk went on and on . <P> " We 'd say ' God help the G.O.P. ' if we believed that the result meant that Lodge would be the Republican presidential nominee , " said the Chicago Tribune . " But we do n't . " The Baltimore Sun allowed that " Mr. Lodge is a good man " but added that his victory was only a " local phenomenon . " In New Hampshire , the Manchester Union Leader 's terrible-tempered Publisher William Loeb , who had backed Candidate Barry Goldwater , described the write-in vote for Lodge as " temporary political insanity . " <P> But in Charleston , S.C. , the News &; Courier , swallowing its disappointment over its idol Barry Goldwater 's indifferent showing , found room to rejoice , after a fashion , over the emergence of Lodge . Said that paper , in what was surely the weirdest political forecast of the year : " The size of Mr. Lodge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert F. Kennedy , suggests to us a Johnson-Lodge combination for 1964.
