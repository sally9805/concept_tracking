Hovering over the open-air podium with his arms outstretched , the white-bearded , white-jacketed conductor looked like a snowy egret about to flap off into the fading sunset . Instead , he flew into Beethoven 's Sixth Symphony , his baton carving the air , his left hand kneading a softly glowing tone from the strings . In Copland 's Quiet City , he moved with the sure , deft strokes of a tailor stitching a hem , weaving the complex patterns into a taut whole . The interpretations , typically , were masterpieces of lucidity and logic , and at concert 's end the audience at Stanford University awarded a resounding ovation to Geneva 's Ernest Ansermet and his Orchestre de la Suisse Romande . <P> The performance was part of a ten-concert series by the orchestra at Stanford . Though the Suisse Romande is well known to American audiences from its recordings , this was the orchestra 's first visit to the U.S. As debuts go , it was a grueling test . Ansermet ( pronounced ahn-ser-may ) led his 115-member ensemble through a symphonic obstacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works of Stravinsky , Bartok , Prokofiev and Berg . As if that were not enough , Ansermet then jetted to Manhattan to conduct five equally demanding works with the New York Philharmonic last week as part of its month-long Stravinsky festival . <P> The major piece on the program was Persephone , in which Ansermet , with a strong assist from Actress Yvette Mimieux , as the narrator , and Tenor Leopold Simoneau , displayed his clean and convincing way with Stravinsky . <P> In Decent Darkness . From Ansermet 's spirited and successful attack , it was hard to believe that he is 82 . Half a century ago , he braved fistfights and a barrage of vegetables to first promote the works of such tradition-shattering composers as Debussy and Stravinsky . As conductor , first of the Diaghilev Ballet Russe and later of the Suisse Romande , which he founded in 1918 , he daringly premiered more new works than most conductors attempt in a life time . Ansermet built the Suisse Romande into one of Europe 's most finely honed ensembles , guest-conducted almost all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been " to bring things of value to light and to leave those of no worth in decent darkness . " <P> In the late 1930s , with the advent of the unmelodic twelve-tone school of Arnold Schoenberg , Ansermet saw darkness . Atonality , he declared , was not music . Drawing on his early background as a mathematics teacher , Ansermet published a complex tome that sought to prove " by mathematical formulas that the strict twelve-tone system is entirely opposed to the laws of hearing . " <P> His close friend Stravinsky was enraged , and the two had a falling out . When the invitation came to take part in the Philharmonic 's Stravinsky festival , Ansermet accepted , hopeful of a reconciliation . But Stravinsky was delayed by illness in coming to Manhattan , and the expected meeting never took place . " I hope we can make peace , " said Ansermet . " We are too old to fight .
