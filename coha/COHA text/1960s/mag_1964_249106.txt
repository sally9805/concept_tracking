The cream-colored draperies parted , the glass door slid open , and there , on crutches , stood Barry Goldwater . Hobbling out to the flagstone patio of his home near Phoenix in the shadow of Camelback Mountain , Goldwater faced scores of Arizona G.O.P. leaders , reporters and television crewmen . Said he : " I want to tell you that I will seek the Republican presidential nomination . " <P> That night , in snow-covered Portsmouth , N.H. , Nelson Rockefeller , a presidential candidate since November , stood before an audience of 1,200 cheering people in a high school auditorium and cried : " The campaign has begun ! " <P> Election Year 1964 was indeed under way , and quite a year it promised to be . The shadow maneuvers of 1963 were over . Barry and Rocky were in the race , while other Republican possibilities jostled for position , all looking toward that day of convention reckoning just six months away . <P> " A Real Rough Go . " Despite some idle talk to the effect that Goldwater did not really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give him a graceful way to stay out , his announcement was no surprise . As his family watched near by , Barry leaned against a lectern to favor his right heel , which had recently been operated on for a calcium deposit . He read his formal statement more slowly and clearly than usual . He had , he said , decided to run " because I have not heard from any announced Republican candidate a declaration of conscience or of political position that could possibly offer to the American people a clear choice in the next presidential election . <P> " I will not change my beliefs to win votes . I will offer a choice , not an echo . This will not be an engagement of personalities . It will be an engagement of principles . " <P> Answering questions , Goldwater displayed the candor and earthy humor that make him an engaging political personality . He would , he said , enter primaries in at least Illinois , California , New Hampshire and Oregon . But , he said , " it 's gon na be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Westerner from a small state , population-wise , to get the nomination . And I 'm willing to take that chance . " He said that he saw " no incompatibility " in filing for re-election to the Senate while running for President . Reporters reminded him that he had been sharply critical of Lyndon Johnson for running for Vice President and the Senate at the same time in 1960 . Well , grinned Goldwater , Lyndon was a good teacher , and " I would like to be a good student . " <P> Did he feel that Kennedy 's death hurt his chances for carrying the South in November ? " Oh , I think you 'd have to be honest and say that it would . You have now a President who is a Southerner-at least he calls himself a Southerner . " But would n't the South be essential to a Goldwater win next November ? " I do n't buy that , and I do n't buy that the South will necessarily go with a Southerner . " Would he concede Texas to President Johnson ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Republican who 's won in a Democratic state , and mister , Democrats do n't know what a dogfight is till they do something like that . " Did he consider Henry Cabot Lodge Jr . a rival for the G.O.P. nomination ? " I consider anybody who has visited with General Eisenhower in the last few weeks a potential candidate .
