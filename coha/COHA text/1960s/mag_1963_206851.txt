James Baldwin , 38 , has brown skin , black hatreds , and a brilliant literary style . In his novels ( Go Tell It on the Mountain , Giovanni 's Room , Another Country ) and essays , Baldwin has written of things he knows well : his native Harlem , homosexuality , France ( where he has lived as a sometime self-exile , supported partly by U.S. foundation grants ) - and what he considers the all but hopeless estrangement between the American Negro and white man . <P> Soon to be published by Dial Press is another Baldwin book , based mostly on a 20,000-word New Yorker essay . It shows Baldwin as the most bitterly eloquent voice of the American Negro . Yet it also shows him as one who speaks less for the Negro than to the white-and it is in that sense that he is most compelling . <P> Elijah 's Hopes . Negroes , he writes , " are taught really to despise themselves from the moment their eyes open on the world . This world is white and they are black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are superior to blacks . . . and the world has innumerable ways of making this difference known and felt and feared . " When Baldwin was ten , two white cops " amused themselves with me by frisking me , making comic ( and terrifying ) speculations concerning my ancestry and probable sexual prowess , and , for good measure , leaving me flat on my back in one of Harlem 's empty lots . " <P> Baldwin has understanding but little sympathy for the Black Muslim movement ( TIME , Aug. 10 , 1959 ) and its mystical leaders , who contend that " Allah " will wreak vengeance on the " white devil . " Visiting the Muslim leader Elijah Muhammad in Chicago , Baldwin found himself wanting to defend his white friends . " I suddenly had a glimpse of what white people must go through at a dinner table when they are trying to prove that Negroes are not subhuman . " When he left , he felt that he and Elijah " would always be strangers , and possibly , one day , enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baldwin . " I could have hoped that the movement had been able to inculcate in the demoralized Negro population a truer and more individual sense of its own worth . " <P> How ? By helping the Negro to accept his past and learn how to use it , says Baldwin . " The Negro himself no longer believes in the good faith of white Americans . . . When the country speaks of a ' new ' Negro , which it has been doing every hour on the hour for decades , it is not really referring to a change in the Negro , but only to a new difficulty in keeping him in his place .
