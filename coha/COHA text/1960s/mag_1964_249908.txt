President Johnson has above all been his own best cheerleader . " Get in your cars and come to the speakin ' , " he implores the streetside crowds that flock to see him . " You do n't have to dress . <P> Just bring your children and dogs , any thing you have with you . It wo n't take long . You 'll be back in time to put the kids to bed . " He invites everybody to the Inauguration . He tells them to " put this in your noggin . " When hecklers jeered him last week , Lyndon said , " Now you folks come on and be happy , come on and be happy ! " <P> Buster Browns &; the Pedernales . He is the master of the homily . In St. Louis he drawled : " I do want you to know , since I was a little boy that went to the post office in a general store the first time and put on my first pair of Buster Brown shoes that were made here in St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of Missouri . I know they are going to do their duty , and I know when they do their duty on November the third that I am going to get a telephone call down at my little ranch on the banks of the Pedernales saying , ' Everything went all right in St. Louis and Missouri today . ' " <P> There are , of course , the statesmanly moments . Eschewing eyeglasses , Lyndon put on contact lenses and , in a toneless , reflective television appearance , told the country that the events in Communist China and Moscow were " large and full of meaning , " but " they do not change our basic policy . " Later in the week , he told newsmen that " divisions and suspicions among our people will only open the doors for those adversaries who seek to divide us and to weaken our leadership . There must be no misunderstanding of America 's purpose and there must be no miscalculation of America 's will . " <P> Economy-Size Aspirin . Johnson also talks about " these people " - meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We must constantly be deliberate , prudent and restrained . Before we shoot from the hip , as Mr. Rayburn , the great political leader , used to say , the three most important words in the English language for everyone are ' Just a minute . ' " From the way " these people " talk , the President declared in southern Illinois , " all that we need to do is to snap our fingers and ancient disputes that have gone on for centuries will be instantly settled . Well , I wish there was some giant economy-size aspirin tablet that would work on international headaches . But there just is n't . " <P> It was precisely because of " these people , " said Johnson , that many Republicans are going to vote Democratic . " It is not backlash , " he said . " That is gone . It is not frontlash . It is the smearlash . Because when people get desperate they get dangerous , and when they get dangerous they are not cautious . And when they get to fearing and doubting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to go along with them . "
