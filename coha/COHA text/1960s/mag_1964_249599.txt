Short of sending him out blindfolded on a moonless night with a black-painted ball , there does n't seem to be much that anybody can do to stop Tony Lema from winning golf tournaments . <P> Last week they tried the next best thing : they sicked St. Andrews onto him - and all Tony did was to win the British Open , for his fourth victory in the last six weeks . <P> St. Andrews purports to be the " birthplace of modern golf , " but that is open to debate . ( Some historians claim that the Dutch invented the game , not the Scotch . ) It also purports to be the toughest championship course in the world - and about that , there is no debate at all . The fishhook-shaped Old Course at the Royal and Ancient Golf Club is only 6,926 yds. long - practically puny by American standards . But it is an un-American course . There are stone walls to play over , tiered greens the size of polo fields , and acre upon acre of prickly gorse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " The Twin Fangs of the Lady of Fife , " " The Valley of Sin , " " Hell Bunker . " For a topper , there is the weather . The word " links , " after all , originated in Scotland . It means " golf course by th sea , " and in the case of St. Andrew ; that means the North Sea . <P> Slick as Ice . If Tony Lema had eve served on convoy duty in World War II , he might have known what to expect . At 30 , he was far too young , am what 's more , he had never even seen th Old Course before . Neither had Jack Nicklaus , 24 , whose $24,000 victor the week before in the Whitemarsh Open put him back on top of pro golf 's money-winning list ( with $81,718 ) demonstrated that he was once more at the peak of his game-and persuaded British bookies to install him as the favorite , at 7 to 2 . The odds on Lema : 7 to 1 . <P> On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open fairways at 60 m.p.h " I could n't keep my footing , " complained Nicklaus , who at 205 Ibs. is one of golf 's best-anchored pros . He three-putted six greens , settled for a 76 . Lema , who weighs in at 180 Ibs. , shot a one-over-par 73 , two strokes off the pace set by Ireland 's Christy O'Connor and France 's Jean Garaialde , and pronounced himself satisfied . " There is nothing comparable to putting in this wind , " he said . " Let me tell you something about golf-it 's a humbling game . " The nicest thing anybody could say about the second day was that the wind was only 45 m.p.h . But somewhere along the way , Lema lost his humility . Normally one of the best wedge players in the game , he changed his tactics , switched to a No. 7 iron , and ran the ball up to the pin . At the turn , Lema was one under par , and he picked up another two strokes on the 312-yd. twelfth hole-driving the green from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 . " They 've got to come and catch me now , " said Tony , whose 68 gave him a two-stroke lead .
