 | Their mothers are rendered uneasy by the quiet ; they even have some unoccupied hours and complain of headaches . The trees are clothed in heathen splendor . The days draw in . For many months the miners will live mainly by artificial light . The holidays of autumn are dreaded . George Lansing has left town , but on Halloween his troop of Mohicans will uproot the Mayor 's gateposts and wrench the hands of the town clock . The stouthearted members of the Women 's Christian Temperance Union are manfully fighting to have the saloons closed on Election Day . Philosophy quickens briefly in the mind of even the most selfsufficient householder as he stands , once again , over his pile of burning leaves . The first snowfall opens wide the eyes of the townspeople ; white casts a more than usual spell in Coaltown . Sophia and Constance did not return to school . A few adults were now nodding to Sophia on the street , but the boys and girls were still vindictive . The boys were still trying to trip her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretending that Sophia , like her wicked father , would shoot them dead . They crowded close about her and then , like panic-stricken doves , fled in all directions . Parents are often heard to complain that their children do not follow their example . With Lily 's departure the work became more burdensome . The weight of routine bore most heavily on Constance in the fall of 1904 and the following spring when she celebrated her twelfth birthday . February and March are the comfortless months . Constance was the only member of the family to indulge in tears and fits of temper . She longed to go to school , to church , to walk in the town . Sophia gave her charge of the ducks , her mother offered her an absorbing occupation remembered from her own girlhood in Hoboken , New Jersey : the care of the grape arbor and the making of the " spring wine " ; but Constance found no interest in animals or plants . She wanted to see people  --  hundreds of people . It was Miss Doubkov who finally came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you 're very wise in not exposing Constance to the rudeness of the children in town , but I feel that  | she needs exercise . When I was her age  --  in Russia  --  my sister and I spent whole days hunting mushrooms and picking berries . If Constance gave you her promise not to go into the center of town , why not let her go into the woods three or four times a week ? " It was wonderful . On alternate days Constance rose an hour earlier and began her scrubbing , mopping , and sweeping . At eleven she slipped out of town by the path behind the depot . She never told her mother that within three weeks she was a welcome visitor in many farmhouses . She sat in kitchens and listened , she helped her neighbors hang out the wash and listened . She sat a while with bedridden grandfathers and grandmothers . She loved to watch people 's faces , particularly their eyes . She had never known shyness . She joined mowers under the trees during their lunch hour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Elms " her tears and outbursts of anger ceased . No Ashley had ever been seriously ill . One morning in October Sophia got out of bed , put on her hat , went downstairs , and started walking to the railway station in her nightgown . She fainted on the main street and was brought back and put to bed . Porky ran to call Dr. Gillies . Mrs. Ashley was waiting for the doctor when he came down the stairs . Her face was more stricken than on the day when her husband 's conviction had been read in court . Her hoarseness had returned . " What . . . what does it seem to be , Doctor ? " " Well , Mrs. Ashley , I do n't like it . Sophie being Sophie , I do n't like it . I think I 've seen it coming on . She 's all tuckered out , Mrs. Ashley . " " Yes . " " Now this afternoon I 'm going to drive her out to the Bell Farm . Every one of the Bells loves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think they 'll charge to board Sophie . " Mrs. Ashley put her hand on the newel post to steady herself . " This afternoon . . . ? " " Now , Sophie do n't want to go . She 's angry at me . She  | does n't know who 'll do the shopping . She thinks the house 'll fall down , if she is n't here . I 've given her something so she 'll rest . I 'll send Mrs. Hauserman over . " " I 'll do the shopping , Dr. Gillies . " " She 'll be glad to hear that . I told her firmly that her father would want her to get two weeks ' rest at the Bell Farm . For the first week I do n't want her to have any callers  --  not even yourself or Connie . But I think it 'd be a good idea if you wrote her once a day . Tell her that ' The Elms ' is running along pretty well , but that everybody misses her. ? I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Caught . . . caught what , Dr. Gillies ? " " For the first ten minutes she did n't recognize me . Old carthorses break down , Mrs. Ashley . They ca n't carry loads of gravel forever . I 'd like to ask Roger to come back and see us . Suggest it to him when you write. ? The Bells have loved Sophie ever since she walked out and asked them for some hog fat to make soap out of . They 're fond of Roger , too , him having worked there all those summers. ? So I 'll be back at three . " " Thank you , Doctor . " As he left the house , Dr. Gillies said to himself , " Some people go forward and some go back . " Beata Ashley went into the flower-pot room and sat down . She tried to rise several times . Waves of self-reproach swept over her . The next morning she dressed for her shopping trip into town . She descended the front steps ; she reached her gate . She could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face the handshakes , the greetings , the stares . . . from the citizens of Coaltown who had so often broken into gales of laughter in the courtroom ... those jurymen , those jurymen 's wives . She returned into the house . She drew up a list of things needed and Mrs. Swenson did the shopping . Nor was she able to fulfill her intention of writing every day . Her letters were lame . She could think of nothing to say . While Sophia was at the Bell Farm she received a letter  | from her brother telling her that he was returning to Coaltown for Christmas . He wrote of this plan also to his mother and sent her , for " fun , " a sheaf of the articles he had published in the Chicago papers under the name of " Trent . " One night in November of that year Beata Ashley was awakened by a noise at her window  --  a rattling and rustling and a faint tapping . Her first thought was that a rain had changed to hail , but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she put one foot on the floor and listened . For a moment her heart stopped beating . Small pieces of gravel were being thrown into her open window . She stepped into her slippers and threw her wrapper about her . She stood against the wall looking down through the window at the croquet ground below . As she watched , a man 's figure turned and hurried away toward the front of the house . She descended the stairs . Finally she opened the front door . There was no one there . She went into the kitchen and lit a lamp . She warmed some milk and drank it slowly . Just so , under the cover of night , John Ashley would return . Just so , he would announce his presence . She climbed the stairs to her room . She removed her slippers . She walked back and forth . There was no gravel on the floor .  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | Tolland , a Canadian . He was waiting to be joined by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuba . John Ashley was a man of faith . He did not know that he was a man of faith . He would have been quick to deny that he was a man of religious faith , but religions are merely the garments of faith  --  and very ill cut they often are , especially in Coaltown , Illinois . Like most men of faith John Ashley was  --  so to speak ? invisible . You brushed shoulders with a man of faith in the crowd yesterday ; a woman of faith sold you a pair of gloves . Their principal characteristics do not tend to render them conspicuous . Only from time to time one or other of them is propelled by circumstance into becoming visible  --  blindingly visible . They tend their flocks in Domremy ; they pursue an obscure law practice in New Salem , Illinois . They are not afraid ; they are not self-regarding ; they are constantly nourished by astonishment and wonder at life itself . They are not interesting . They lack those traits  --  our bosom companions  --  that so strongly engage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , destructiveness and self-destructiveness . No pathos hovers about them . Try as hard as you like , you can not see them as the subjects of tragedy . ( It has often been attempted ; when the emotion subsides the audience finds that its tears have been shed , unprofitably , for itself . ) They have little sense of humor , which draws so heavily on a consciousness of superiority and on an aloofness from the predicaments of others . In general they are inarticulate , especially in matters of faith . The intellectual qualifications for faith ? as we shall see when we consider Ashley 's faith in connection with his mathematical gift and his talent as a gambler  --  are developed and fortified by a ranging observation and a retentive memory . Faith founded schools ; it is not dependent on them . A high authority has told us that we are more likely to find faith in an old woman on her knees scrubbing the floors of a public building than in a bishop on his throne . We have described  | these men and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , humorless , so often unlearned . Wherein lies their value ? We did not choose the day of our birth nor may we choose the day of our death , yet choice is the sovereign faculty of the mind . We did not choose our parents , color , sex , health , or endowments . We were shaken into existence , like dice from a box . Barriers and prison walls surround us and those about us ? everywhere , inner and outer impediments . These men and women with the aid of observation and memory early encompass a large landscape . They know themselves , but their self is not the only window through which they view their existence . They are certain that one small part of what is given us is free . They explore daily the exercise of freedom . Their eyes are on the future . When the evil hour comes , they hold . They save cities  --  or , having failed , their example saves other cities after their death . They confront injustice . They assemble and inspirit the despairing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? They are slow to give words to the object of their faith . To them it is self-evident and the self-evident is not easily described . But men and women without faith , they are articulate . They are constantly and loudly expatiating on it : it is " faith in life , " in the " meaning of life , " in God , in progress , in humanity ? all those whipped words , those twisted signposts , that borrowed finery , all that traitor 's eloquence . There is no creation without faith and hope . There is no faith and hope that does not express itself in creation . These men and women work . The spectacle that most discourages them is not error or ignorance or cruelty , but sloth . This work that they do may often seem to be all but imperceptible . That is characteristic of activity that never for a moment envisages an audience . John Ashley was of this breed . No historic demands were laid upon him and we do not know how he would have met them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was  | almost invisible . For a time many tried to catch a glimpse of him through his children . He was a link in a chain , a stitch in a tapestry , a planter of trees , a breaker of stones on an old road to a not yet clearly marked destination . Ashley had no idea who his rescuers were . Perhaps a miracle is like that  --  simple , natural , and unearthly . Their actions had been swift , precise , and silent . They had smashed the overhanging lamps . His guards had lunged about in the dark , shouting ; they had fired a shot or two and then ceased . His handcuffs fell from his wrists . He had been led out of the car  --  more carried than led  --  into a grove . One of these friends had placed his hand upon the saddle of a horse . Another had given him a suit of worn blue overalls , a purse containing fifteen dollars , a small compass , a map , and a box of matches  --  all in silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed on his head . Finally one of them lit a match and again he saw their faces . These railway porters did not look like Negroes , but like the grotesquely blackened performers in a minstrel show . The tallest of them pointed in a certain direction , then slowly his extended finger moved fifteen degrees to the right . Ashley said , " Thank you . " They disappeared . He heard no sound of horses ' hoofs . Simple , natural , and unearthly . Left alone , he lit a match and consulted his compass . The friend had first pointed to the southwest then to the west . Ashley knew that he was beside the railroad yard near the station at Fort Barry . Sixty miles to the west was the Mississippi River . He changed his clothes , rolling his prison garb into a bundle which he attached to the pommel . He found a bag of apples and a bag of oats hanging from the saddle . He was filled with wonder . He laughed softly . " Gee whillikers ! Gee whillikers ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Ashley death is never now  --  there remains always a month , day , hour , even a  | minute to live . He had never known fear . Even when the sentence was read in court , even when he sat in the train on what the newspapers would certainly be calling his " last journey , " he had felt no fear . To a John Ashley worst never comes to worst . When the match was lit in the grove he had looked at the horse and the horse had looked at him . He now mounted her and waited . She moved forward slowly . Did she see a path through the thick undergrowth ? Was she returning to her stall ? After ten minutes he again lit a match and consulted his compass . They had been moving to the southwest . He split an apple and shared it with her . They rode on . At the end of an hour they came to a broad country road and turned right . Twice he heard riders coming from the east behind him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trees . He heard the reverberations of a wooden bridge beneath them ; they went down the bank and drank from the stream . They resumed the journey at a brisker pace . Ashley felt younger hourly . He was filled with an indefensible , an impermissible , happiness . He was out of that jail where he had suffered more in body than in mind . From time to time he dismounted and walked beside the horse . He felt the need to talk . The horse seemed to like being talked to ; in the diffused starlight he could see her ears rising and falling . Bessie ? ... Molly ? . . . Belinda ? . . . Someone gave you to me . It 's not often one receives presents like that  --  a present as big as a whole life . Will I ever know why six men risked their lives to save mine ? Will I die without knowing that ? " No ! Your name is Evangeline , bringer of good tidings ... . It 's been strange , has n't it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a part in a mysterious adventure  --  in an act , like this , of generosity and courage . No one knew when you were broken  --  it must be a black and frightening thing to be broken , Evangeline ! ? that one day you would carry a man on your back and give him a chance to live . . . . You are a sign . We 've both been marked for something . " After these conversations he felt even more buoyant . Not  | forgetting to listen for oncoming riders , he even sang fragments of his favorite songs , " ' Nita , Juanita , " and " No gottee tickee , No gettee shirtee , At the Chinee laundryman 's , " and the song of his fraternity at engineering school , " We 'll be true until we die to the brothers in Kappa Psi . " The west began to brighten . Dawns are poor things in Coaltown . He was overwhelmed with the wonder of it . " Yes , that 's what they mean when they say a ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and read the signs ; to the south , " Kenniston , 20 m. , " to the northeast , " Fort Barry , 14 m. , " to the west , " Tatum , 1 m . " He passed through Tatum , blank and pallid in the early light . Two miles beyond it he turned left into a deep wood , following a brook . He found seven yards of rope attached to his saddle and tethered Evangeline . He poured some oats into the crown of his hat ( blew on it , sniffed it , took some into his mouth ) and set it before her . In the bag of apples he found some baked potatoes . He glanced briefly from time to time at Evangeline . Ashley had ridden horses as a boy , spending his summer vacations on his grandmother 's farm . She  --  the old independent eccentric gray-eyed Marie-Louise Scolastique Dubois Ashley  --  was the person he most loved until his twenty-first year and the person who had most rigorously loved him . She was , besides many other things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her from far and wide . She infuriated many a farmer with her denunciation of his husbandry . She moved among horses like one knowing their language . Cattle , dogs and cats , birds , deer , even skunks exchanged intelligence with her . By day and often far into the night under a kerosene lamp John helped her with injections , boluses , cataplasms ; together they had delivered colts and calves ; they had put many an animal to sleep . He remembered some of her injunctions : " Never look a horse or a dog or a child in the eye for longer than a few seconds ; it shames them . Do n't stroke a horse 's neck , slap it ; and after you 've slapped it , slap your own thigh . Do n't do anything sudden with  | your feet . Feet and teeth are what they use to attack their enemies and to defend themselves . Joe Dekker 's always closing his stall door with a kick of his foot ; his horses hate him . If you 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you at a distance striking yourself with it . When you give him oats , sniff it first ; blow it all over the place ; eat some , and then give it to him as though you hated to part with it . " Ashley had owned a horse and buggy in Coaltown , having paid a bottom price for Bella , an unamiable beast . He had driven Bella for ten years in a friendship to which only a ballad could do justice . He now stole some glances at Evangeline . She was no longer young , but she had been well cared for and was soundly shod . He fell off to sleep , though he was tormented by fleas . He had written Beata daily from the jail , without mentioning the fleas . He had told her how he missed his bed and the sheets smelling of lavender . He awoke in the early afternoon . It was intensely hot , even in the deep forest . " Come on , Evangeline . Let 's follow the stream and find a pool . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool . He tethered Evangeline for the last time . He lay in the water and closed his eyes . " Beata knows now . Roger will have heard . Yes , Porky will have heard first . ' Mama , Papa got away . ' " He tried to imagine his own future and to plan for it , but he was deficient in that aspect of the imagination which has to do with taking shrewd care of oneself . He had little if any faculty for making plans ; he had no experience of worry . People who are habitually anxious forge plans day and night . Serener natures are incomprehensible to them ; they appear to drift and procrastinate . But John Ashley was laying plans without being aware of it . He spent eight days sleeping in the woods . Each evening he awoke with a project formed in his mind . Plans were the gifts of sleep . Waking on that first evening near Tatum , it was clear to him that he was a Canadian on his way to work in the mines of Chile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an engineer with experience in mining . He knew very little  | about Chile , but the little he knew suited his situation . Chile was far . It was part of the folklore in engineering schools that no bright graduate went to Chile , if he could help it . The conditions of life and work there were massively difficult . You worked the nitrate mines in intolerable heat on a desert where no rain ever fell . The best copper mines in the Andes , with one famous exception , were located above eleven thousand feet . You could n't take a wife there . There was no entertainment . You could n't even drink above ten thousand feet  --  not what a man calls drinking . His goal was Chile . Not only was Ashley going to Chile , he would become a Chilean . The next morning he learned that he was to descend the Mississippi River on a lumber barge . Five years before he had borrowed a surrey and taken his family to see the river . The trip had been taken in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip to Chicago , as being cheaper . The Ashleys had sat long on the bluffs above the stream , completely satisfied by the spectacle . They had taken a great interest in the various barges , short and squat or long and narrow , that floated down the river or laboriously chugged their way up it . A passerby informed them that the long thin ones were lumber barges from the north on their way to New Orleans . " Swedish fellas on ' em . Ca n't speak twenty words of American . " Ashley had not been in swimming since his student days , but he thought he could swim to midstream . On the third evening it was revealed to him that he was crossing the country too quickly . When he reached the river he must walk boldly into some rural community  --  as primitive a one as possible  --  in order to purchase some food and to sell Evangeline . He could not expose himself to that danger until his hair and beard had grown . Each morning and evening he leaned over a pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in jail on the night that his sentence was pronounced , five days before his train journey . Now each morning there was greater promise of a brown plush mat . A foolish honey-colored beard  | was forming . He needed this to cover a scar on his left jaw ; he had fallen on a hay fork thirty years ago while working on his grandmother 's farm . He must remain hidden for a time in this thinly populated region . He now stayed two nights in each camping site . He massaged his scalp . Other projects became successively clear to him  --  ways of reaching the southern Pacific Coast , ways of earning money . There were some problems to which the counsels of sleep offered no solution : how , in time , he would write to his wife , how he would send her money , how he would learn what was passing at " The Elms . " In the meantime the land was swarming with John Ashleys . Colonel Stotz in Springfield began receiving the first of hundreds of letters and telegrams  --  within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  telling him where Ashley had been seen ; many of them demanded their reward ( it had risen to four thousand dollars ) by return post . Travelers between the ages of twenty and sixty were being pulled off their horses , dragged from their buggies , pursued across fields and their hats snatched off . Sheriffs became sick and tired of all the indignant and often terrified bald men who were brought before them . Newsboys cried " Extra ! Extra ! " Ashley had been found living on an Indian reservation in Minnesota , his face stained with walnut juice . Ashley had been found sequestered in an expensive private institution for the insane in Kentucky . Great wealth and important connections were increasingly associated with the fugitive . Ashley made nicks in his saddle to mark the days , but even so lost track of them . The oats and the bag of food came to an end . Berries were beginning to redden ; he found watercress . A change came over horse and rider ; they grew younger . When they took to the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware that her coat shone , even before he took to currying her with fistfuls of twigs and moss . He had the  | sensation that she had accompanied hunted men before , that she was no stranger to pursuit and secrecy . The traffic on the road increased . She heard the oncoming hoof beats before her master did and found hiding . When they aroused barking dogs she took to a gallop . When , for the third time , he dismounted to walk beside her she showed her displeasure and it came to him suddenly that hounds might have been put upon his scent . When his mood inclined toward dejection during the day she moved toward him and tried to distract him ; she snorted into the water of the brook or she pawed the ground . When he was afflicted with diarrhea she gazed soberly into the distance ; she counseled fortitude . Riding along after midnight he would occasionally see the light of a lamp from the second story of a farmhouse . To a family man the sight suggests sitting up beside an ailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of emotion . He learned that he must limit the occasions when he could permit himself to think of the past . Memories pressed upon him , uncalled , all but unendurable . He held in his arms for the first time  --  wonder of wonders  --  the newborn Lily . He surprised for the first time a look of fear directed toward him on the face of his son , Roger , three years old . ( He had had to be severe ; he had had to spank him . The boy had twice broken away from his mother 's hand and run toward the horses in Coaltown 's main street . ) He returned from work and was met again by Constance 's clamorous welcome , and heard Lily rebuking her : " You do n't have to act like a pack of dogs when Papa comes home ! " From time to time it had been necessary for him to spend the night , on the mines ' business , in Fort Barry  --  he heard Sophia saying , " When Papa 's not in the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different . " And Beata , the good , the patient , the silent , the beautiful . " Evangeline , I 'm a family man . That 's all . I have no talents . I 'm not even an engineer . All I have to show , living and dying , is that I 'm a family man . Girl , why did this meaningless , crazy thing happen to me ? "  | At Coaltown , even in his home , Ashley had not been a talkative man , yet he now talked copiously to Evangeline . " I know why you 're looking so handsome . You 're thinking what I 'm thinking . We ca n't go on this way for five hundred miles . I must sell you and you want to fetch me a good price . Goodbyes are hard . They 're like death  --  like my grandmother 's death . The only thing to do about them is to know them , to take them completely into yourself , and then put them out of your mind . They 'll come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's no good to reach out after them . . . . I told you all about my grandmother who did so much for horses . I 've been thinking about her more and more on this trip we 're making . She 's come back to me when I need her . She taught me how not to be afraid . Have you noticed that no hunters have shown up to disturb us , no farmers have come into these woods to mark their trees , no sheriffs have been sitting up all night waiting for us to pass by ? It would be a pity , would n't it , if this adventure of ours , that started out with such bravery and generosity  --  shucks , it would be a pity if it ended up with another little train ride to Joliet . But better men than you and I have been ambushed , greater hopes than ours have been brought down like a house of cards . Sure , Evangeline , if the spectacle of one defeat or of a hundred defeats discouraged a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no justice on earth , no hospitals , no homes , no friendships like yours and mine . There 'd just be moaning people , creeping about . Let 's not do anything foolish . " Ashley had told her all about the trial . " There 's nothing awful about dying ; the only awful thing about dying is the things you leave unfinished . Can you imagine it ? I left no provision for the education of my children . How could I have been so stupid ? Beata set aside a little money every week for Lily 's voice training ; it was eaten up by the trial , of course . I suppose I assumed that the boy could fend for himself and that I could send the younger girls to better schools when the  | time came . If Beata had firmly called my attention to it , I could have done something about it . I could have hunted for another job , or insisted on a raise , or have really pushed those inventions of mine . . . . Mind you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was happy and stupid . Happy , asleep , and stupid . " By the end of a week he was satisfied that he had a modest stand of hair . He rubbed some dirt on his head and squeezed the juice of some purple berries on it and was astonished . He could have entered civilization two days before . His beard made him look like a wan theological student . The long thin line of his scar could be seen through it . He experimented with the saps of twigs and roots in an effort to stain it . It became manly and opaque . They reached the river at Gilchrist 's Ferry toward two in the morning of the following night . All was dark in the town . He followed a road to the south along the bluffs . After riding an hour he came upon a cluster of houses and stores , a church and a schoolhouse . He was barely able to make out a sign on the front of one of the buildings : " United States Post Office , Giles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have a fine upstanding post office , " he murmured and rode on . An hour later he found what he wanted . There was a general store with a long hitching rail before it , a blacksmith shop beside a dirt clearing in which stood a stake for pitching horseshoes , some shacks , some steps leading down to a landing on the river . Downstream he saw some lights on what appeared to be an island . He retraced his road to a place about a mile north of the village , sat down on the bluff , and fell asleep . He awoke at dawn . Through the mist he saw a long lumber barge descending the river . There was a light in the wheelhouse . He thought he heard voices . He imagined that he smelled coffee and bacon . On the highest Andes a zephyr may precipitate an avalanche . It was the imagined smell of coffee and bacon that unmanned John Ashley . It brought back with it " The Elms , " the job in which he delighted , the long weariness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten yards from him , Lily 's singing , Roger 's selfreliance , Sophia 's watchful gravity , Constance 's boisterous love ? all , all , all . He put his head between his knees . He fell over to one side , then rolled over to the other . He groaned , he lowed , he bayed . The anguish of mind in a mature man is borne in silence and immobility , but John Ashley was not a mature man . The sun had been up several hours when he returned to the village . He tethered Evangeline to the hitching rail and stood on the bluff for a long time looking at the river , his back to the general store . He knew that an increasing number of eyes would be fixed upon him and would be appraising the horse . Finally he turned , strolled across the road , nodded to some men on the porch , and entered the store . Five men were standing or sitting about a cold stove . All but the storekeeper dropped their eyes to the floor . Ashley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was returned . He purchased a box of ginger snaps , discreetly displaying some dollar hills . He ate a cookie in thoughtful silence . The curiosity about him became intense . Some more men drifted into the store . " Where you from , son ? " asked the storekeeper . Ashley pointed north with his thumb , smiling : " Canada . " " Sight ways ! " The words were repeated in a murmur around the room . " I took it slow . Hung up in Ioway a bit . Hunting for my brother . " " Well , now ! " Ashley continued to chew meditatively . More men and boys gathered about the door . A rig drew up . " Suppose I could buy some breakfast ? Eggs , bacon ? Like two bits ' worth ? " " Well ! . . . Emma ! Emma ! ... Fix the fella some eggs and bacon and grits . " A woman appeared at the door behind the counter and stared at him . Ashley tilted his hat . " Right kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She disappeared . There was another long silence . " Where you thinking to find your brother ? " " Got word maybe he 's down to New Orleans . " " Well , now ! " Ashley looked at the storekeeper and said in scorn , " Up to Gilchrist 's Ferry a man offered me twenty-four dollars for my horse ! ? What 's this place called ? " " Just called ' Hodge 's . ' " The heads of the men in the doorway had turned to gaze at Evangeline . Several sidled out through the open door to join a circle forming around her . There was talk in low tones . Ashley went out on the porch , still chewing , and looked up and down the river . Addressing no one in particular he asked , " On those lumber barges , do they ever take a man on , just for the ride ? " " Some does and some do n't . " " Do they ever pull up here ? " There was a low laugh . " They keep away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shore any . See that island down there ? That 's Brennan 's Island . They stop there now and again . There 's two of them there now . See them ? " A young man had pulled back Evangeline 's lips and was examining her teeth . Evangeline put back her ears and snorted . Ashley did not look at her . " I 'll give you twenty dollars for the horse and saddle , " said the young man in a loud voice . Ashley gave no sign of having heard him . He re-entered the store and sat down on a nail keg , his eyes on the floor . Emma brought him his breakfast in a pewter basin . Evangeline neighed . Some women came into the store and made some purchases in a constrained manner . Evangeline neighed again . There was a stir at the door ; the loungers drew back . A short solid woman of fifty marched in and placed herself before Ashley . She was wearing a jacket and skirt of the denim from which overalls are made . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled close over her short wiry  | hair . Her scuffed cheeks were red , almost as red as the turkey-red scarf tied about her throat . Her manner was brusque , but a smile seemed to come and go in her gray eyes . " Thirty dollars , " she said . Ashley looked up at her quickly , then ate a forkful of grits . " Is that you who just come in that rig ? " " Yes . " " Let me look at your horse . " The woman gave a scornful snort . Ashley filled his mouth again slowly and went out into the road . He inspected her horse from all sides . The woman stood beside Evangeline , who bunted her sleeve and shoulder smelling oats . " Thirty-two , " said Ashley , " and you get someone to row me to Brennan 's Island . " " Done ! ? Follow me . " Ashley paid his bill , exchanged grunts with the company , and rode after the woman 's rig . At the end of ten minutes they turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOI ) GE , HAY AND FEED . She called " Victor ! Victor ! " A boy of sixteen came running from the barn . Ashley dismounted . " Does that horse know her name ? " " Yes  --  Evangeline . " " Where 'd you get that saddle ? " " Friend gave it to me . " " I 've only seen one like it before . It 's Indian work . Victor , put Evangeline in Julia 's stall and give her some oats . Then get your oars . I 've got to go in the house and fetch something . Let my rig stay like it is . And bring me a jenny bag of corn . " Evangeline did not look back . Mrs. Hodge was gone some time . She returned carrying an old carpetbag , which she handed to Ashley . " Victor , row this gentleman over to Dinkier 's . Take the corn down to the boat and wait for him . " Victor started down the steps to the dock . Mrs. Hodge took  | an old shapeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hand . " It 's a fifty-dollar horse , what with that saddle . Give that corn to Win Dinkier  --  runs the store at Brennan 's Point . Tell him it comes from Mrs. Hodge . Tell him I said to fix you up on one of those Swede barges . " She looked at him in silence for a moment . Only once before had he seen such eyes  --  his grandmother 's . " Keep your mouth closed . Do n't go shooting anybody , unless you have to . Take off your hat . " He did . She nodded , laughing in a low rumble . " Coming on . You 'll not need to wash your head for a week or two . " Ashley put his hand on her wrist . He asked urgently , " After a while . . . could you think of some way to get a word to my wife ? " " Start getting down into that boat. ? To torment her worse ? Say to yourself : seven years . Leave impatience to boys . Goodbye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She added : " Trust women . Men wo n't be much help to you from now on . " She turned and went back to her house . Ashley spent the next four days in and around Dinkler 's store , which was part grocery , part chandlery , and part saloon . It sold flea and tick powder . Barges came and went . When Dinkler 's was full of rivermen he stayed in his shed at the water 's edge . The satchel Mrs. Hodge had given him contained socks , underwear , shirts , soap , a half-used tube of salve , a razor , a frayed copy of Robert Burns 's poems , and a suit of church-going black , of old-fashioned cut and for a taller man . Thrust into the pocket was an old envelope addressed to Mrs. Tolland Hodge , Giles , Illinois . He did not finish the letter that began " Dear Bet . " He decided that his new name was James Tolland , a Canadian . On the fifth day Win Dinkier put him on a Norwegian barge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the akvavit you could drink .  | Life on a barge headed downstream is of an almost intolerable boredom . The men played cards . He won back half his passage and half his akvavit . He made friends . In their language the rivermen called him the " young one . " To explain himself he told a number of lies and was allowed to resume his taciturnity . On clear nights he slept under the stars on the odorous boards . At table he repeatedly turned the conversation toward the subject of New Orleans . He learned the names of a number of reunions where fairly clean cards were played far into the night . He was warned to avoid a certain cafe , Aux Marins , which was frequented by smugglers , ammunition runners , and the like  --  men without " papers . " He heard a great deal about the importance of " papers . " Just when he was beginning to be concerned about the problem of eluding the port inspectors the solution was offered to him . Twenty miles north of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barge . There would be long chaffering . They would be offered clandestine rum , mash , . rapot , and aphrodisiac drugs . His moment came ; as the boat was leaving , Ashley seized his carpetbag , jumped into the boat , shouted goodbye to his friends and was rowed ashore . In New Orleans Ashley seldom left his room by day . He wore his overalls and went to no pains to keep them neat . He dragged his fingers through his thick hair and even rubbed grime on his face . He was a Canadian seaman looking for a job . He changed his lodgings every four days , never moving far from the neighborhood of Gallatin and Gasquet streets . There was nothing about him to arouse suspicion , but he was everywhere an object of curiosity and he knew it . But for a long time he was unaware that a preposterous thing had befallen his appearance . The curly straw-colored sidewhiskers followed the line of his jaw , descending to a short beard . Other curls played about his wide forehead . The commonplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange distinction . He had come to resemble one of the Apostles  --  a John or a James  --  as they are  | pictured in art , particularly in bad art , on name-day cards , and votive medals , or as wax or plaster statues . People stopped to stare at him ; later , in the southern hemisphere , passersby furtively crossed themselves . Ashley did not know this , or that the police ? alert for the bloodthirsty assassin of Illinois who had shot his best friend in the back of the head and had fought his way , singlehanded , through a posse of ten armed men  --  gave no second glance at this pious-looking youth . Every night at eleven he pushed open the door of Aux Marins , murmured " Bon soir " cheerfully , and sat down with his newspapers . He often laid out a pack of cards and studied the card games he had been taught on the raft . Jean-le-Borgne suffered from insomnia . Night after night he postponed the hour when he must climb the circular iron staircase to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canadian customer at his games and proposed that they play together . It became custom . The stakes were small . Luck favored them in alternation . Ashley learned la manille , les trois valets , and piquet . There was at first little conversation , but the silences became congenial . Finally Ashley 's patience was rewarded . He learned of a certain ship that would be leaving  --  in a week or two , or maybe a month or two ? for Panama from a certain abandoned and decaying dock on an island in the Delta . Its cargo would be , ostensibly , rice . Ashley needed money . He had the black suit altered to fit him . He put on a high stock collar . He presented himself at La Reunion du Tapis Vert and at La Dame de Pique , paid his door fee , and joined the tables . These clubs were frequented by small merchants , in slavery to cards , and by the younger sons of plantation owners who had no wish to play under their fathers ' eyes at the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won nor lost ; toward four in the morning he would occasionally have a sudden run of luck . When he resorted to cheating it was with limited ambition and great circumspection.  | Ashley was a man of faith and did not know it ; he was also a gifted mathematician  --  perhaps with a touch of genius  --  and did not know it . He was a born card player , though he had not played in twenty years . In the fraternity house at his engineering school in Hoboken , New Jersey , there had seldom been fewer than six games in progress , night and day . Ashley had no competitive sense and no need of money , but he took great interest in the play of numbers . He drew up charts analyzing the elements of probability in the various games . He had a memory for numbers and symbols . He had applied himself there to not winning overmuch and  --  since he was president of the fraternity  --  to preventing any other player from doing so . On the barge , at play with Jean-le-Borgne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; alone in his room he studied their structure . Men of faith and men of genius have this in common : they know ( observe and remember ) many things they are not conscious of knowing . They are attentive to relationships , recurrences , patterns , and " laws . " There is no impurity in this operation of their minds  --  neither self-advancement nor pride nor self-justification . The nets they fling are wider and deeper than they are fully aware of . Clarity is a noble quality of mind , but those who primarily demand clarity of themselves miss many a truth which  --  with patience  --  might become clear at some future time . Minds that are impatient for clarity  --  or even reasonableness  --  become gradually narrower and dryer . A few years after these events a relatively obscure scientist , working in a bureau of weights and measures in Switzerland , was searching  --  as were many others  --  for a formula that would express the nature of energy . He tells us that it appeared to him in a dream . He awoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a laughable self-evidence . An ancient philosopher ascribes knowledge to recollection : the delighted surprise at learning what one already knows . Ashley had no idea why he was so accomplished a gambler . He relied upon a whole series  | of fetishes , irrational promptings and superstitions , and was ashamed of them . Faith is an ever-widening pool of clarity , fed from springs beyond the margin of consciousness . We all know more than we know we know . His sailing was delayed . He waited . Several nights a week , in grimy overalls , he explored the city . He renewed a lapsed curiosity about the lives of others . His interest was centered on the relationships in the family . With the coming on of night he set out on long walks . He became an impenitent eavesdropper . He followed married couples ; he particularly lingered where he could overhear the conversation between a father and his older son or daughter . Everywhere he attempted to appraise the quality of a relationship . He turned about the homes of the prosperous as though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself in the lives of those in his own quarter . He came to feel like some husband , father , or uncle who returns unrecognized after years of absence ? an Enoch Arden , a Ulysses beggar at his own hearth . He was driven by a need to persuade himself of the happiness of others . He shrank from the sights and sounds of brutality and disease , but , by some unhappy chance , he came upon them everywhere . In the mines at Coaltown he had learned to distinguish the cough of tuberculosis ; he now heard it on all sides and saw the red spittle on the pavements . He had thrust upon him the marks of other diseases , also  --  the one-eyed , the ravaged noses . Everywhere prostitutes patrolled their exclusive territory , as bees are said to do . He did not venture into the half-mile square of Storeyvillefamous in song , parterre of youth and beauty , selected and fostered from among thousands . Here about him were women who could never enter Storeyville or who had outlived their service there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of laughter and contentment . This was followed by an hour of strolling , of sitting on galleries and front steps , of low-voiced courtships , of measured  | discussions in the cafes  --  lofty intelligences discussing politics . By ten-thirty , however , the mood changed . An ominous current invaded the city . By midnight sudden cries filled the air , blows , pursuits , overturned furniture , sobbing and whimpering . In Coaltown the report that men  --  particularly the miners  --  beat their wives was matter for laughter . Here Ashley saw them . In a narrow alley he came upon a man striking a woman , blow after blow ; she sank gradually to her knees , taunting him as no father , as a clown of a father . Another man was beating a woman 's head monotonously against the wall of a staircase . He saw children cowering under blows . A girl of six rushed from a doorway and leapt into his arms like a squirrel on a treetop . A man followed her , his head lowered , a table leg in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ashley hurried away . A hunted man is in no position to defend the persecuted . He longed to be at sea , to be on a mountain peak , on the Andes . He waited . He descended . He ventured into other cafes . He spent an evening at Joly 's , at Bresson 's , and many an evening at Quedebac 's . The underworld has its hierarchies . Ashley was a pariah and must accept his caste . One stratum above him was Bresson 's  --  the resort of thieves , burglars , pickpockets , small-time confidence men , the touts at races and cockfights . These were active eager-eyed men , full of plans , heavy drinkers , loud talkers , boisterous liars . Whenever the police  --  in or out of uniform  --  strolled among the tables at Bresson 's , the habitues neither lowered their voices nor glanced up . Their remarks took on a sarcastic edge ; they pretended they were unaware of the intruders . These were convivial men and they admitted only convivial men to their number . Ashley was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiosity . Below him was the rock bottom of social life  --  Joly 's  --  the pimps ' cafe , which no other man ever knowingly enters . Pimps foregather only with one another .  | In his ignorance Ashley spent an evening at Joly 's . Toward the end of it Joly approached him and asked him in a low voice , " Are you from St. Louis ? " " No . " " I thought you was Herb Benson from St. Louis ? You 're in the tambour ? " Ashley did n't know why he should be in any " drum , " but he compliantly said that he was . " Where did you work ? " " Up in Illinois . " " Chicago ? " " Near it . " " Great in Chicago , eh ? Great ? " " Yes . " " Well , well ! Baba 's Louis had to go up the river . You know Baba ? She 's the one just went out  --  the fat one . She told me to tell you it 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 'd bring you thirty dollars a week  --  more , if you 'd jump with it . " " Why would she bring me thirty dollars ? " Joly 's breath stuck in his windpipe . His eyes started out of his head . " Get up and get out of here ! Get out of here quick ! Get ! Get ! " Ashley stared at him , put down a coin , and went out the door . Joly flung the money after him down the street . Ashley 's stratum was that of those who had failed in both the orderly and disorderly life . Their cafe was Quedebac 's  --  men returned from long prison sentences , unlucky housebreakers , unlucky gamblers , ex-pimps , ex-touts , spiritless men , many with tremulous hands and tremulous cheeks . They fed in the sheds at the back doors of convents . Some , intermittently , washed dishes in restaurants ; some , intermittently , earned their living at the dismalest of all professions  --  were orderlies in hospitals . Ashley heard from them of their work and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master his repulsion ; he was afraid of nothing  | except himself . Fastidiousness is a timidity . He did not know if hospitals demanded to see the " papers " of orderlies . In the meantime he was searching for Spanish speakers ; he found one and paid for his lessons in drink . Women came and went , the last rejects of their profession . " M'ssieu James , will you buy me a verte ? " ( Absinthe . ) " I ca n't afford it tonight , Toinette . You can have a beer . " " Thank you , M'ssieu James . " The word " reprobate " is used loosely ; this was the world of reprobates . All speech was obscene , but not from any intention to startle or even to convey emphasis . Reprobates are incapable of anger ; they have lost the right to it . They have been judged and they agree with their judges . They tell few lies . They have nothing to hide and little to gain . They are generous to one another , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All was new to Ashley . Quedebac 's made little claim on compassion , even if he had possessed a measure of it . But Quedebac 's increased the turmoil of questioning within him  --  the constant urgent unanswerable questions . Yet he did not find the cafe uncongenial ; he even pushed open the door with a stirring of anticipation . He was casually welcomed . The even flow of conversation was uninterrupted . The process of learning is accompanied by alternations of pain and brief quickenings of pleasure that resemble pain . It took him a year and two weeks to reach Chile . He moved down the coast , finding passage in small ships , avoiding the larger ports when he could . There was generally work for a man who could do sums , was of open approach , and had an air of authority ? provided , however , that he wore a workman 's clothes . Work for a gentleman would be hard to find . He kept accounts in warehouses . He weighed produce on plantations . When questioned about his papers he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire in Panama . He was believed or indulged .  | He tallied cargoes in Buenaventura . He supervised turtle hunts on the low islands off San Barto . Ashleys give all of themselves to whatever task lies before them . Everywhere he was asked to stay , but he moved on . He sat late in bars ; he played cards . His knowledge of the seaboard dialect progressed rapidly . When there was no work to be found he even picked up a little money as a public letter writer . He spent three months at Islaya . It is a truth well known but seldom uttered that almost any foreigner is a better foreman over a group of Ecuadorian laborers than any Ecuadorian . He slept on the stinking decks of guano boats and closely observed their management . After several trips he was put in charge of one . He was shipwrecked among silver barracudas and lost a third of his crew . It was perhaps his fault , for he pretended to a knowledge of navigation he did not possess , but bad conscience did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men are threatened with hunger , hidden reefs , and storms ; all waters are shark-infested . It later became common knowledge that all the Ashleys were incorrigibly immoral . He quickly made a place for himself in the oil fields at Salinas . He could have settled down and advanced far . Everywhere there were card games far into the night  --  here under the tent of netting and the hurricane lamp . Dr. Andersen , the Dane , was a pleasant fellow . There was an American , Billings , traveling in pharmaceuticals . " Slap it down , Billings . Slap it down. ? How 's your rat list ? " " Slow , very slow . " " Do you know what the rat list is , Tolland ? " " No . " " It 's a list of hunted men with a price on their head . Who are you looking for now , Billings ? " " Vice-president of a Kansas City bank . Run off with a hundred thousand dollars and a sixteen-year-old girl . " " Probably down here ? "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico this year . " " What 's the money ? " Three or four thousands . " " What are his marks ? " " About forty-four . Round pink face . Two gold teeth . " " Slap it down , Billings ! ? Did they ever catch the judge ? " " Found him dead in Santa Marta . Took his own life , looked like . Tired of running . Seems like people got tired of feeding him , too . Two hundred pounds down to ninety. ? Just got word of a new one  --  four thousand dollars . Man in Indiana  --  shot his best friend in the back of the head . Terrible type . Would n't want to meet him on a dark night . Shot his way free , single-handed , out of a posse of twelve men . " " Old or young ? " " Has grown children . " " Any marks ? " " I forget. ? Do you know a good way to catch a rat ? " Billings lowered his voice and narrowed his eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you think you 've spotted your man , you come up behind him and shout his real name ' HOPKINS ' or ' ASHLEY ' ? like that ! " In Callao , Ashley got work in a Chinese importing firm . His employers had seldom encountered honesty outside their own race . He was advanced to a position just short of partnership . His duties , however , increasingly required his calling at important firms in Lima . He resigned . He moved to a squalid lodging by the sea near Callao . He had journeyed thousands of miles . He had entered realms far stranger to him than those described by the geographers . He was now idle . Hitherto constant activity had concealed from him the full burden of his widening knowledge . While waiting for a coastal steamer he fell gravely ill . Despair probes the organs one by one , seeking the easiest entrance for the kill . He was saved from  | death by the sisters , old and young , turn and turn about by his bed . His convalescence was surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canadiense . " His ascent had begun , perhaps . " That 's Chile , " said the Captain pointing toward the low shore . Ashley 's heart gave a leap . He had reached Chile . He was still alive . This was the land of his adoption . But he was not yet ready for Arica or Antofagasta . He asked to be rowed ashore at San Gregorio . There he learned that a Norwegian trading ship would put in at any time  --  in a few days or in a few months . He was low in funds . Most of the hundred and fifty dollars he had saved in Callao had been stolen from him . A hard core of money which throughout the year he had sewn into the lining of his belt was safe ; that was held intact for his final throw of the dice : his passage to Antofagasta and his presentation of himself to the mining authorities there . Once ashore in San Gregorio he looked about for work . There was none to be found . He engaged a bed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pallet under an overhang in the stables . He busied himself with removing the filth as best he could . He was the governor of his mind : He did not permit himself to be aware of hunger or to recognize the disgust he felt at the vermin he harbored . He sat in Pablito 's tavern all day and far into the night . Within a week he was playing cards with the mayor , the chief of police , and the leading merchants . He lost a little ; one evening in three he gained what he had lost and more . He was blackened by the sun ; his hair was long and unruly . In spite of his mastery of the dialect and abject lodging , he was " Don Diego " or " Don Jaime " ? he preferred the latter . He explored the little town and its environs . He made friends . Through no efforts of his own he again became a public letter writer . His charges were moderate , a few coppers . People who had not sent a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . There was much correspondence about inheritances , dictated by those who had bitterly learned to avoid lawyers . Tradesmen wanted letters written in dignified castellano . There were love letters and threatening letters to be delivered after dark by the town 's clever hunchback . He even wrote prayers that were to be hung over a child 's bed as amulets . He listened to long feverish whispered stories . He advised , he consoled , he reprehended . His hands were being continually kissed . Don Jaimito el bueno . From his card partners he began to pick up information about copper mining in the Andes , about the Scotchmen and Germans who worked the mines , and about the cold and heat that alternated above ten thousand feet . The city fathers returned to their homes at eleven o'clock for dinner and left Ashley to silence , warm beer , and Maria Icaza . Maria Icaza was midwife , abortionist , maga , teller of fortunes , interpreter of dreams , go-between , exorcisor of devils . She was Chilean and Indian , yet there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Persian . " Bluest of all were her heavy eyelids , which descended over her eyes like hoods . She said she was over eighty . The claim added to her authority ; she was probably seventy . She sat against the wall and brooded about crime , disease , folly , and death . From time to time her clients consulted her or called her away . Ashley 's customers likewise drew up their chairs beside him . Both held office hours in whispers . Both had dogs that would not stir a yard from their feet ? Maria Icaza 's Fidel and Ashley 's Calgary  --  good friends for lack of better . There were fleas on the ground and gnats in the air ; a slight mitigation of the heat could be felt toward two in the morning . They exchanged salutations . She directed one of her customers to his table ; there was a letter to be written . He directed one of his customers to hers ; there was a crisis to be met . Finally , they were playing cards , a pile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few dozen words were exchanged in an hour . From time to time Maria Icaza would be shaken by fits of coughing . The long red scarf which she pressed to her mouth was streaked dark brown with blood . When she felt a severer fit coming on she and Fidel walked with dignity to the outhouse , whence the sounds of her agony could be heard in the long silence of the night . " Where did you catch this cold , Maria Icaza ? " " High  --  high in the Andes . " Their friendship grew in their silences ; it was cemented by their destitution ; it was nourished by the prevalence of misery in San Gregorio . The second week he was " Don Jaime , " the third " Jaimito , " the fourth " mi hijo . " She frequently laid out her pack of cards in his intention or somberly studied the palms of his hands . He told her he put no faith in such things . She replied , using a vulgar idiom , that that made no difference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she put her blue forefinger on a card and waited until he had looked up into her face . She made the gesture of a rope around her neck . Looking at her interrogatively he flung the rope around his neck and pulled the end abruptly toward the ceiling . " I do n't know , " she answered surlily . One night as she laid out the cards he asked , " How many children have I ? " " Do not ask me such questions . If you doubt me , you can go and stand on your head in the excrement ! You have four or five children . " " Are they well ? " " Why would they not be well ? " One night he began telling her his whole story . She interrupted him , saying , " What happens is not interesting . " " What is interesting , Maria Icaza ? " " God , " she replied , pointing first to her forehead , then to his .  | Maria Icaza was a singer when her health permitted . Old Pablo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saloon before midnight . Once in a while , when the city fathers had gone to their homes , he nodded a grave permission to one or other of the choicest  --  to Consuelo or Maridolores . They were required to sit sedately with a glass before them . Occasionally it made for good business . Maridolores , the joyous one , would murmur , " Maria Icaza of my heart , one song ! One song ! Don Jaime , ask Maria Icaza to sing one song . " Fidel seemed to understand what was wanted . He would plant his forepaws on her lap and plead for a song . Ashley would glance at her with affectionate anticipation . Old Pablo would place a glass of rum before her with a bow . Maria Icaza would begin abruptly in a voice of extraordinary volume and range . A long heart-chilling cadenza , " Ale ! " would fill the room . Then : " The lacemaker sits at her window Blind ! Blind ! Comb your hair , little one . There 's enough sadness to come . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons , my daughters ? " Fidel looked eagerly from face to face to make sure that all would rise to this privilege . At the refrain the girls beat their saucers with spoons . Maridolores leapt to the floor , her heels resounding like drumbeats . The pharmacist next door woke , dressed , and came down with his guitar . The room filled . Oh , what an hour ! What passion ! . . . What memories ! A throng gathered in the street outside the tavern . What a clapping of hands ! Maria Icaza , the beautiful  --  sing ! " Finally Ashley would whisper , " Do n't sing any more , Maria or :  | Icaza ! Save your breath , for the love of Christ ! " The festival would come to an end . Fidel lay down , his muzzle against his mistress 's stocking , replete with pleasure . A transient happiness had descended upon San Gregorio . Maria Icaza asked Ashley to tell her his dreams . He answered he could not remember them . She laughed contemptuously . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You have not been sleeping . I will tell you your dreams . You are having the dream of the universal nothingness . You walk down , down , into valleys of nothing , of chalk . You stare , you stare into pits where all is cold . You wake up cold . You think you will never be warm again . And there is this nothing  --  nada , nada , nadabut this nada laughs , like teeth striking together . You open the door of a cupboard , of a room , and there is nothing there but this laughing . The floor is not a floor . The walls are not walls . You wake up and you can not stop your trembling . Life has no sense . Life is an idiot laughing. ? Why did you lie to me ? " He said slowly , " I could not tell anyone about them . " He went out the door and stood a long time with his hands on the parapet above the waves . When he returned she gestured to him to deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maria Icaza ? " " Later. ? Play ! " An hour later she said , " Naturally , you have these bad dreams , mi hijo . " " Why , naturally ? " " God in His goodness sends them to you . " He waited . " He does not want you to be ignorant any longer . You are ignorant . You are very ignorant. ? Cut the pack . I wish to read what the cards tell me . " She laid them out , yet seemed scarcely to glance at them . " You are forty-one or forty-two years old . " She drew her finger across her face . " You have no wrinkles here  --  from care  | and thought . You have no wrinkles here  --  from laughter . Your understanding is like a little fetus  --  a poor little twisting and turning fetus  --  trying to be born . When God loves a creature He wants the creature to know the highest happiness and the deepest misery  --  then he can die . He wants him to know all that being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ashley looked down and said in a low voice , " I have been very happy . " She swept her hands in scorn across the cards on the table , the landscape of his life . " That ? That  --  happiness ? No ! No ! There is no happiness save in understanding the whole . You are a creature whom God loves  --  particularly loves . You are being born . " Here she fell into a fit of coughing and drew the red scarf across her mouth . When she had recovered she put her hand into a voluminous and bulging pocket in her skirt . She drew out a small crucifix rudely carved from thornwood . " Before you go to sleep look at it well . Think of that suffering . Not the nails . The nails are not important . There are nails everywhere . But think of the suffering  --  there ! " She put her fingers on the center of her forehead . " He who held in His mind a hundred thousand San Gregorios and Antofagastas and Tiburones and  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " A hundred thousand Caltones . Look at it , then put it by your head when you sleep . You will have no more nightmares . There is no happiness for those who have not looked at the horror and the nada . " He took it . He put his hand on hers and asked softly . " Have you known the highest happiness , Maria Icaza ? " Her spine straightened . Her chin rose . She looked out of the door , then glanced at him with a faint smile of contempt that said , " Of course , I have . " She took the crucifix out of his hand for a moment . She  | pointed to the red glass beads that had been affixed to it to represent the drops of blood . She looked at him . " Red . Red . Look at the red . Men , women , and children love you because of the blue of your eyes . But there is a better love than that . Blue is the color of faith . But red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that you have faith . So has Fidel ! Faith is not enough . Maybe , if you are lucky , you will be born into love . " Ashley lowered his voice and lowered his eyes . " Maria Icaza , dear Maria Icaza ! If I am born again , if I know the best and the worst , that can not help my children . I fathered them when I was still in ignorance . " Maria Icaza struck his hand sharply . " Idiot ! Imbecile ! If God plans to give you His greatest gifts , it is because you always merited them . " Maria Icaza had never seen an oak tree , but she quoted the Spanish proverb , " The oak tree is in the acorn . " She went on , " If Simon Bolivar had fathered a child at sixteen and died next day , the child would still be the son of the Liberator . " Ashley had no more nightmares . The Norwegian trading vessel put in a few days later . Ashley had barely enough money for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Maria Icaza in the hospital . He attached to it a card all red . In his preparations for departure he lost the crucifix . In Antofagasta Ashley found lodgings in the workers ' quarter and set about planning his campaign unhurriedly . From five in the afternoon until well after midnight he sat , alternately , in the Cafe de la Republica and the Cafe de la Constitution , bent over one or other of the German-language newspapers published a thousand miles to the south in that province of Chile which is a new Wurttemberg . These cafes were in rat catchers ' country ; his presence was risky but necessary . All around him , hour after hour , men were talking of nitrates and copper . He soon became aware that another marginal man was frequenting the two cafes . " Old Percival " was a derelict of the fields , a former nitrate man , a former silver man , and a former copper man . He had lost an eye to  | love or dynamite and his wits were dim from wine and from brooding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his more prosperous friends and waited to be offered a drink . It was often given him ; he was often rebuffed , though never roughly . He introduced himself to Ashley : " Roderick Percival , sir , former managing director of the El Rosario Smelter . Inventor , sir , of the Percival Centrifugal Retort System  --  stolen from me by the Graham brothers , Ian and Robert , and I do n't care who hears me say so . " This was the overture to some fifty hours of soliloquy . Ashley drew his guest to less metropolitan bars . He submitted to many a repetition . He began to suspect that some of his guest 's grievances were justified . Again , his patience was rewarded . " Mr. Tolland , sir , never work at a mine that 's over ten thousand feet above sea level . Why shorten your life , sir ? Nobody opens their mouth to say a word ; they save their breath . Up there men get melancholy . Chap blew off the top of his head at Rocas Verdes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at a mine that 's far from a main line . A man ca n't get away for a spree . Why , there are some mines up there where the bucketline to the junction breaks down four times a summer  --  avalanches . Men get to hate the sight of one another . . . . Do n't work at any mine that 's not financed by American capital . There 's the ticket . Look at El Teniente . You 'd think you were at a Saratoga Springs hotel . Hot showers , if you please , day and night . Houses for married engineers ! Of course , liquor 's forbidden , but a smart man knows a trick or two . Why , they 've got a lunchroom fifteen hundred feet down a shaft  --  ham sandwiches and lemonade . Look at Rocas Verdes  --  lot of Scotchmen and Swiss and Germans . You 're lucky if you get a bowl of oatmeal . Besides a lot of the miners are Bolivian Indians  --  ca n't even talk Spanish . " Ashley saw his way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The representative in Antofagasta was Mr. Andrew Smith , who , at all temperatures , wore a black alpaca jacket buttoned up to his black Covenanter 's beard . It re-  | quired all Ashley 's equanimity to stand up to Mr. Smith 's piercing gaze .... " Mr. James Tolland , of Bemis , Alberta . . . a mechanical engineer , eager to learn copper mining . . . citizenship papers and academic certificates unfortunately lost in a hotel fire in Panama . . .. Letter of recommendation from Dr. Knut Andersen of the Salinas oil fields in Ecuador . . . . " Mr. Tolland submitted some mechanical drawings  --  equipment for a coal mine . Ashley might have spared his pains . Mr. Andrew Smith engaged him on the spot , delaying only to ask him about the condition of his heart and lungs . Ashley 's work  --  to start with  --  was to supervise the living quarters of the engineers and the miners  --  heating , kitchen , sanitation  --  and to prepare plans for the further installation of electricity . He would receive a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to learn the processes of copper mining in all its phases . He was given instructions concerning his clothing and equipment and the money to purchase them . " The company , " said Mr. Smith , " would like ye to go to Manantiales for a week . That 's just short of seven thousand feet and will prepare ye for the higher altitudes . When you coom in this afternoon to sign the contract , I 'll gi ' ye a letter to Mrs. Wickersham . She runs a hotel there  --  her Fonda , the best hotel in South America . It can be she 'll take ye and it can be she 'll no . She 's like that . A train leaves on Friday at eight o'clock and if it does n't leave on Friday , it leaves on Saturday . When you get to Rocas Verdes write me once a month about what you need there . " Ashley brought more questions to Roderick Percival . At first Percival was evasive about both Dr. MacKenzie and Mrs. Wickersham . Apparently he had suffered at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rocas Verdes mines and had been disbarred from the Fonda . MacKenzie was crazy ; had lived " up there " too long ; had a closed mind ; thought he knew it all ? conceited as an old baboon . Mrs. Wickersham was a " tartar " ; ran a hotel as though it were her private home . . . . Nosey  --  a  | trouble-making gossip ... likes to call herself the " newspaper of the Andes " . . . knows all the stories of the seventies and the eighties ; awful bore , always repeating herself . Percival knew her when she was nothing but a cook for a party of emerald hunters . Anyway , she 'd had one moment of good sense ; set up her hotel in the only agreeable place in north Chile . She 's not only got her hot springs , but the only real river within hundreds of miles ... . " There are no streams around here , Mr. Tolland . No rain .

Surely , yes , surely , the snow and ice up there melt at the edges and big streams form , but they do n't get far . Sucked up by the sun and sucked down by the soil . Why , we would n't have water in Antofagasta if Peter Wessel had n't made that pipeline . A Dane  --  great friend of mine . He wanted to make a Tivoli Gardens here , like they have in Copenhagen . Was n't as crazy as it sounds . With all that nitrate in the soil , your roses would grow to Heaven . All you need is water and shade . And Mrs. Wickersham 's got that at Manantiales . Feeds her guests vegetables that would win first prize at any county fair in the States . Feeds her hospitals and orphanages with them , too ....

Now , as though scales had fallen from his eyes , he saw only poverty , hunger , disease , and violence . Stores and houses were open to the street . Early in the evening the air was filled with laughter and terms of endearment . The bonds within the family appeared to carry a warmth unknown further north . But toward midnight the temper changed . He no longer shrank from these sights and sounds , these blows and imprecations . He even sought them out , as though there were something to be learned from them : some answer to that per-  | sistent " why ? " He had never been a man of reflection . He had no vocabulary and no grammar with which to reflect on such matters , except those which he had long repudiated  --  the sermons delivered in Coaltown 's Methodist church . He began to be afraid  --  an Ashley afraid ! ? that he would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his life " stump ignorant . " Take this omnipresent wife beating : Groping , he tried to recall an evening in Salinas and some remarks of Dr. Andersen . There had been a card game under the tent of mosquito netting in that house raised on piles above the shore . It was a popular saint 's day and the clamor of the festivities could be heard from the distant workers ' quarter . One of the players made a joke about all the wives who would be beaten that night . The doctor , speaking dryly and fastidiously , had said : " The men ca n't strike us . We are foreigners , unbelievably rich , semi-divine . They ca n't strike their foremen  --  though once in a while they can ambush and shoot them . They strike one another , but they do n't put their heart into it . They know they 're all caught in the same desperate trap . But they can beat those who are nearest to them . The blows are aimed at circumstance , at destiny , at God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wretched husband and father does not strike his loved ones across the eyes or in the belly : those blows require two executioners ; someone must unfold the cowering victim . Pedro would not permit another man to touch his treasures . " " But ... " Ashley remembered protesting , falteringly , " the men are drunk . " " That 's too easy an explanation , sir . They are devoted husbands and fathers . They get drunk in order to be brutal , to release themselves to strike at God . " " I do n't understand . " The game went on . Later Ashley asked , " Do they beat their wives and children in Europe ? " " In Denmark , do you mean ? In my home ? ? Oh , Mr. Tolland ! We civilized men have more refined tortures . "  | " What ? ... What ? " " It 's your deal , Smithson. ? Suffering is like money , Mr. Tolland . It circulates from hand to hand . We pass on what we take in. ? It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said something about " sometimes the chain is broken . " Now , in Antofagasta , Ashley 's distress was increased by the frequent view of persons who resembled the members of his family . At first glance these short , bent , black-clothed women bore no likeness to Beata , but occasionally a gesture or a word recalled her . Like hers , their lives were centered about one man of unpredictable moods , their breadwinner , who slept beside them  --  a man occupied with his own interests far from their eternal kitchen ; they were bringing up children ; they were growing old . He saw an occasional Lily . Roger looked at him sharply and hurried by . He bought fruit syrups from Sophias . Other Sophias waited on him in restaurants . He played checkers with a Constance . More frequently he encountered a Eustacia Lansing . The train was scheduled to arrive at Manantiales at four or five or six in the afternoon  --  eighty miles in eight to ten hours . For a time it careened gaily over the plain , then crept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trestles . It made long halts in villages that came to life when it approached  --  - parched nitrate towns clustered about a water tower whose seepage and intermittent shade had produced one pepper tree . At each stop all the passengers descended from the cars . The engineer , firemen , and conductor consented to have a glass or two with the stationmaster . Hour by hour the landscape became more awe-inspiring . The Pacific Ocean below them became a vaster platter . The peaks above them drew near and seemed to lean above the train . Ashley had seen Chimborazo from Guayaquil , rising almost twenty-one thousand feet from the sea ( " Beata should see this ! The children should see this ! " ) , but these were Chile 's mountains , his  --  henceforward his .  | The wooden benches on the train were filling up long before its departure . Ashley found a place opposite and beside a large family . He exchanged no words with them after the first prim greeting . He read or pretended to sleep . Some neighbors had come to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Widow Rosa Davilos and Maria del Carmen , sixteen , Pablo , Clara , Ines and Carlos . The neighbors also wore black and were accompanied by their daughters . ( There is a proverb : " A daughter is a domestic calamity . " ) Each brought a small gift of food  --  accepted after such long scenes of surprise and protest that there was little breath left for thanks . When the train finally started all crossed themselves devoutly and the widow was urged for the twentieth time to submit to the will of God  --  an injunction that Ashley knew denoted some last numbing demand on human fortitude . The family glanced from time to time at the gentleman . It was soon assumed that so exalted a personage would take no interest in their conversation , even if he were able to understand the dialect in which they spoke . The widow wrapped herself in desolation and leaned her cheek against the window frame . The older son , opposite Ashley , gazed somberly before him , withdrawn into contempt from the woman talk that flowed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the food that was piled on Clara 's lap . Clara , fourteen , appeared to be her mother 's deputy . An hour later the children were still complaining of hunger . Finally their mother opened her eyes and said , " Eat ! " Clara divided the food into five portions and gave Ines and Carlos their share . The four older members of the family denied that they were hungry . The gestures of sacrifice were transformed into a bitter quarrel . Pablo urged his mother to eat . In tones of hysterical exasperation she commanded him to eat . Maria del Carmen had no appetite . " God in Heaven , why have I been given such children ! " " Mama , " said Clara softly , " you 've dropped your purse . Here it is. "  | " My purse ! That 's heavy , my purse ! Keep it ! " " Yes , Mama . " By noon the children were again hungry . Clara told them long rambling stories about the Infant Jesus . He passes through rooms where little children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls beautiful , so beautiful . Then , still in a low voice , she told them of the wonderful life that awaited them in Manantiales . " Do you know what Manantiales means ? It means that water comes right up out of the ground . It comes hot and it comes cold . And flowers everywhere  --  everywhere you look . And Grandmother will say , ' Go out into the garden , Ines of my eyes , and bring me some roses to put before the Mother of God . ' Do you remember what Grandmother said when she came to see Papa before he went to Heaven ? She said there was an English lady in Manantiales who had a school for girls and that she would make Carmencita a laundress and , maybe , me a nursing sister and that we would bring money  --  money  --  money to Mama every Saturday of the Lord . This English lady  --  when a girl wants to be married , she gives her a bed and a griddle ! " " And shoes , Clara ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " " Does she do anything for boys ? " " You do n't listen ! When she sees Pablito , she 'll say , ' I do n't know what I 've done that God is so good to me ! I 've been out of my mind looking for a strong honorable boy to take care of my mules and horses ! ' And when Carlos gets bigger she 'll say , ' I 've been watching that Carlos Davilos for some time now . I 've plans for him . ' " Here the Widow Davilos opened her eyes , leaned forward , and gave Clara a resounding slap across the face . " Mamita ! " " Hold your noise ! Filling the children 's ears with that nonsense ! You and your English lady and your griddles and your  | shoes. ? Tell them we have nothing to live for ! Tell them that ! " " Yes , Mama . " The food was again distributed . Maria del Carmen accepted her share . Clara placed a portion on Pablo 's knee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maria del Carmen covered her eyes with her hands and shuddered . Her mother looked at her angrily and suddenly pulled her hands from her face . " Do n't be a fool , child ! Look down into that ravine ! Look ! It would be better for us all if we fell into that ditch . " Clara looked sternly at her mother and crossed herself . Her mother was stung . " What does that mean , little pestilence ? " " Mama , we want you to live more than anything in the world . " " For what ? Tell me that  --  for WHAT ? Your father has left us nothing . Nothing . Nothing . You grandmother can do nothing for us . Your uncle Tomas is below worthless . She has three women in the house already . You know what became of Ana Romero 's children . You know that ! " " I am ready to beg , Mama . I will take Ines and Carlito with me . They can sing . " Again her mother slapped her sharply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beggars ; He only hates the people who do n't give anything to beggars . If Papa did n't leave us anything , it was the will of God . " " What 's that ? What 's that ? " " If Papa fell and hurt his head , it was the will ? " " Your father was a saint , a perfect saint ! " Pablo threw a glance of angry scorn at his mother . " What are you looking at me like that for ? You ! You never appreciated your father  --  never ! Oh ! If you turn out to be one-tenth the man your father was , I know someone who 'll be very much surprised ! " " Mama ! " whispered Clara . " Do n't you ' Mama ' me ! " " Mama , you know you said to Sister Rufina how proud  | you were of Pablito . You said he was the manliest boy in the quarter . " " You ! " Pablo stood up and said loudly , " Papa was a st00000pid ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I was married to your father for twenty years . I bore him nine children . I was the happiest woman in Antofagasta . " " You were happy ! You were happy ! ? Were we happy ? " Rosa Davilos started to reply when Clara said to them all , authoritatively , " Papa is watching us . " Ashley wiped his forehead . He all but groaned aloud . He seemed to himself to be dreaming  --  that is : present at one of those ten-act dramas of which we are simultaneously the spellbound spectator , the protagonist , and the unavowed author . A quarter of an hour later his eyes happened to meet those of Rosa Davilos . As she looked at him expressions of astonishment and fear crossed her face . She drew herself up and assumed the air of a great lady . When the passengers descended at the next station she moved her family to another car . He walked down the village 's one sunbaked street . He stood by the water tower and the pepper tree . At intervals he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cracking the surface to extract the nitrate that would cross the seas to furnish instruments of death and to fertilize crops . " Life affords no second chances , " he thought . " Is this what growing older is  --  seeing always more clearly the things we failed to see ? " When he returned to the train he found himself in the midst of another family  --  a party so large that it filled several benches . All were a little tipsy . They were celebrating the name day of a little old lady who sat opposite him , giggling sleepily . From time to time her children and grandchildren would lean down and embrace her , exclaiming noisily : " Mamita , you treasure ! " " Abuelita , darling ! " The men pressed drinks on him . He was introduced to them all and paid his compliments to the old lady . It is the diversity of life that renders thinking difficult .  | Many a beginning philosopher has been on the point of grasping the problem of suffering , but what sage can cope with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the workers ' quarter . His depression lifted . He was young ; he was well ; he had escaped his pursuers . For the first time in a year he was in a temperate climate ; the nights were cold . Best of all he was active . He repaired the flue in his landlady 's kitchen ; he roused her son from torpor and together they cleaned the cistern . He sang . He made himself useful in the neighborhood and was invited to dinner . Imagine a gentleman getting himself dirty at tasks like that ! It was " Don Jaime " here and " Don Jaime " there . It was said later of the Ashley children that they were all slow to mature . They were , but not as preposterously slow as their father . The principal harm in being thus fast or slow seems to be that the growing boy or girl may skip or skimp or overprolong one or other of the automutative phases to which  --  as it were  --  the young are entitled . John Ashley of Pulley 's Falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexander conquering one world after another , but he had not been the boy who gives his life to working among lepers ; he had been the knight crusader of the story books , but he had not seen himself as the statesman who would correct all the injustices in the social order . He had been a rebel only to the extent of erecting a wall between himself and his doting parents and of rejecting their idols . At engineering school he had calmly declared himself to be an atheist , only to commit himself to a more abject superstition : he had been certain that some agent was at his beck and call ; catastrophes descended upon other people but not upon him ; circumstances rushed forward to offer him whatever he most wanted . Above all , he had barely brushed that phase in late adolescence when every youth is an argumentative philosopher . Ashley in Manantiales was belatedly suffering pains that he should have endured twenty years before . At night he lay on the roof of his inn and gazed up at  | the constellations among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book thousands of miles away , he thought : " In infinite space , in infinite time , in infinite matter , an organism like a bubble is formed ; it lasts a short while and then bursts ; and that bubble is myself . " Another memory of his past life returned to torment him ? his relations with his parents . John Ashley had eloped with Beata Kellerman on the day following his graduation from engineering school in Hoboken , New Jersey . His parents had journeyed down from Pulley 's Falls , New York , to be present at the exercises . They had seen him carry off the honors , prize after prize . The next day they returned to their home ; he was to follow them within the week . At Christmas he sent them a card without return address . He never wrote them , though he considered doing so in his happiness when Lily was born . Without resentment and with little cause for resentment both he and Beata had cut themselves off from their families . During all the intervening years this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only now , when his attention was so urgently directed toward the family life about him , did he begin to ask himself anxiously wherein he was to blame . Was he an unnatural son ? Had this " unnaturalness " exerted a harmful influence in the life of his own family ? Would his children , in turn  --  self-sufficient and without affection  --  disappear into the throng ? Had there been something amiss in the life at " The Elms " ? But there had been seventeen years of loving happiness there ! Why , then , had Maria Icaza replied with scorn to his claim to having been happy ? His father had been an honorable man , a leader in the community , the president of the bank in Pulley 's Falls . John was an only child , though he remembered that his parents had lost two children in infancy , two girls , before he was born . His father had been taciturn and undemonstrative , perhaps in reaction to his wife 's effusiveness . His mother idolized her son , adored him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceal an unspoken contract . Adoration of a human being , under guise of self-effacement and humility , advances large claims and is an attempt at possession . John had a good disposition ; his rejection of his mother 's demands on him never took the form of exasperation . He pretended to be unaware of them . He had in his life an example of the love which enlarges freedom ; the summers he spent on his Grandmother Ashley 's farm were the happiest days he was ever to know . It came back to him now that his father had one trait that had then seemed to him to be embarrassing but unimportant . His father had been a miser  --  a clandestine miser . His house was run in comfort ; he made his contribution to the church ; but any financial demand that exceeded his precise budget tortured him . His wife spent a great deal of time and ingenuity in attempting to conceal the extent of his idiosyncrasy from the neighbors , but stories circulated of complicated maneuvers to save a " red cent " ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father was rich , probably very rich . In addition to his work at the bank he was constantly buying and selling farms , houses , and stores . Now , in Manantiales , Ashley realized that he had formed himself to be the opposite of his father and that his life had been as mistaken as his father 's . The root of avarice is the fear of what circumstance may bring . The opposite of the miser is not the spendthrift of the parable  --  the prodigal son who wastes his substance in riotous living  --  but the grasshopper who heedlessly sings through a long summer . Ashley had lived without fear and without judgment . He groaned aloud . " Is that what family life is ? The growing children are misshapen by those parents who were in various ways warped by the blindness , ignorance , and passions of their own parents ; and one 's own errors impoverish and cripple one 's children ? Such is the endless chain of the generations ? " Ashley 's wonderful grandmother had been an eccentric . He knew very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Roman Catholic in  | Montreal . Marrying his grandfather , a small farmer on rocky soil , she had attended his Methodist church . She had persuaded him to move fifty miles south to better soil . But something had gone wrong between them . She had joined one of those peculiar religious sects  --  rigidly ascetic , yet given to emotional camp meetings and to " speaking in tongues " ? that were particularly prevalent in northern New York State . Her husband had left to seek gold in Alaska . She ran her farm alone with the help of a succession of unreliable " hands " and developed her extraordinary gift for handling animals . She was strong-minded and tirelessly active ; lavish in the works but not the words of love . She had sent her son to a small college from which he graduated to become the banker of Pulley 's Falls  --  living in that world of little triumphs and vast dreads , which is a miser 's life . Thereafter there had been no friendly bond between them . Had her very virtues been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endless chain of the generations ? During those summers his grandmother had taken him to the Wednesday-evening prayer meetings at her church . He was surprised to see that there was no preacher . Some sat , some stood , some knelt . There were long silences . There were short hushed hymns . There were brief requests for patience , for death , for light . All churches henceforward seemed trivial to him who had known this self-forgetting urgency . The company seemed to be waiting for his grandmother to pray . When she had spoken the meeting came to an end . She arose and addressed the Lord without closing her eyes . She spoke with a strong French accent which , when she was in deep earnest , became almost unintelligible . Many times her contribution was brief . Her thought turned always on God 's plan for the universe . She asked to be shown her part in it . She complained of His slowness in its fulfillment . She asked that God be merciful to those who in wickedness or in ignorance had interfered with His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with electric energy . There was no doubt about it  --  it was  | her wickedness and ignorance that weighed her down  --  but all of her listeners took it on themselves . There was a murmuring and a rising and a sinking to the floor and a covering of eyes . John could not understand why his grandmother talked like that . She was the perfectest person he had ever known . Finally she consoled herself and the congregation by the conviction that God converts even our shortcomings to His own ends . She always ended by saying : " Let 's sing , ' Come Holy Ghost and Make Thy Home . ' " He understood her now . He lay on the roof of his inn and gazed up at the constellations . He was dog-tired and slept . The moment in his growth arrived when he felt the need to admire someone . His thoughts kept returning to that Mrs. Wickersham . He visited her hospital , her orphanage , her lacemaking school for the blind . These first two were municipal institutions , but the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all were hers . He had not called with Andrew Smith 's letter at " the best hotel in South America " ; that was rat catchers ' country . He saw her riding her black horse through the streets of the town  --  erect , authoritative , her iron grey hair pulled back to a low bun under her wide-brimmed Spanish hat , a red rose in her lapel  --  doing her marketing and visiting her institutions . Storekeepers and shopgirls rushed out into the street to kiss her hand ; men stood with lowered attentive heads while she harangued them . She spoke the language of the working people even better than he did . She laughed . Everyone around her laughed . Ashley seldom laughed ; he did not despise laughter , but it seemed to him to be prompted by unimportant digressions that delayed the sober occupations of life . His curiosity was aroused by Mrs. Wickersham and he was ready to admire her . He came to know the hours when she was absent from her hotel . One morning he went to the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was told she was out . He walked by the house boy into the reception room and said that he would wait .  | A number of the Conquistadores chose to end their days in the new world . It is hard to believe that they did not wish to return to that Spain of powerful compulsion  --  to Vizcaya , mother of seamen , even to Estremadura , whose beauties are not revealed to the hasty . They settled down in America , built themselves houses , and begot broadnosed children . But they had left a realm that was even closer to them than their birthplace and their land of adoption  --  the oceans which they had crossed and recrossed so many times . Their new homes were white without and within , with one exception . The walls of their reception rooms were painted blue from the floor to the level of a standing man 's eyes : the lower portion of the four walls was sea-blue , the sea on a day of sun and light breeze . Mrs. Wickersham had also brought the sea and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a center table hung the model of a sixteenth-century galleon . On the wall  --  embattled Presbyterian though she was  --  she had placed an enormous time-faded crucifix . Through the open door and windows the wealth of the garden threatened to inundate the room in a many-colored tide . For Ashley the function of a room was to be serviceable ; it had never occurred to him that it could be beautiful . He who lacked so many qualities  --  humor , ambition , vanity , reflection  --  had never distinguished a category of the beautiful . Some pictures on grocers ' calendars had pleased him . At school he had been praised for the " beauty " of his mechanical drawings . We remember how on his flight through Illinois he had been overwhelmed by the beauty of dawn , and later of Chimborazo , and of his Chilean peaks . He sat down in a high-backed chair and looked about him . He became aware of an odd sensation in his throat : he sobbed . His eyes rested on the exhausted and submissive head on the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suffering , and confusion , but men and women could surmount despair by making beautiful things , emulating the beauty of the first creation . He rested between sleeping and waking . He was abruptly  | aroused by a sharp voice . Mrs. Wickersham was standing at the door looking at him . She spoke with military truculence : " Who are you ? " He rose quickly . " Is James Tolland here ? " he asked . " James Tolland ? I do n't know the name . " " I hoped he 'd be here , Mrs. Wickersham . I 'll call later . Thank you , ma'am . Good morning . " The next day he continued his journey . He had his first nosebleed at nine thousand feet . He lay down on the floor of the train . He kept laughing quietly and the laughter hurt him . At the junction for Rocas Verdes he was met by two Spanish-speaking Indians . The connecting line had been interrupted by an avalanche ; they must proceed on muleback . He rode five hours , half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road . He arrived at the mines at noon on the following day and was put to bed for twenty-four hours by the Dutch doctor . Several times he awoke and smelled violets or lavender . His mother 's clothes had been redolent of the sachets of violet that her husband had unfailingly given her at Christmas . Beata had cultivated beds of lavender at " The Elms " ; her clothes and the household linen breathed lavender . It cost nothing . At times Ashley 's room was filled with people . His mother and his wife stood at either side of his bed and firmly tucked the ends of the blanket under him . They had never met , but seemed now to have entered into a close understanding . The blanket pressed upon his chest . Their faces were grave . " You 're not going to school tomorrow , " his mother said in a low voice . " I shall write a note to Mr. Shattuck . " He pulled at the blanket to free himself . " Mama , I 'm not a mummy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think we 're going to like it here , " said Beata . " You always say that ! " " Go to sleep , dear . "  | " Where are the children ? " " They were here a minute ago . I do n't know where they 've gone . " " I want to see them . " " Sh , sh ! Go to sleep now . " He awoke later at the moment when Eustacia Lansing entered the room . She was wearing one of those outrageous dresses of plum color and red , suggesting tropical flowers and fruits set in deep green foliage . There was the fascinating mole under her right eye . He verified for the thousandth time that one of her eyes was green-to-blue and the other was hazel-to-dark brown . As so often she seemed scarcely able to contain herself ; some merriment , some reprehensible joke was about to convulse her . John Ashley had made it a rule in life not to permit his thoughts to dwell on Eustacia Lansing . At most he allowed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brush her . But altitudes play strange tricks on a man . " Stacey ! " he cried and began to laugh until his sides hurt . " This is n't high , " she said in Spanish . " The children want to go much higher . " " Stacey , you ca n't speak Spanish ! Where 'd you learn Spanish ? ? What children ? Whose children ? " " Our children , Juanito . Ours . " " Whose ? " " Yours and mine . " He was laughing so he almost fell out of bed . His fingertips touched the floor . " We have no children , Stacey . " " Donkey ! How can you say a thing like that ! We have so many and you know it ! " Suddenly hushed , he asked hesitantly , " Have we ? I only kissed you once and Breck was standing right beside you . " " Really ? " she said , a strange smile on her face . " Really ? " and she went out the closed door . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | faith . It is too early to treat of love . The last appearing of the graces is still emerging from the primal ooze . Its numerous aspects are confusedly intermingled  --  cruelty with mercy , creativity with havoc . It may be that after many thousands of years we may see it " clarify " ? as is said of turbid wine . His colleagues were embittered men . They had left their countries and kin  --  they had left home life itself  --  and come thousands of miles to live in a barely supportable climate  --  all to make their fortunes . But fortunes in the field had been made in the seventies and eighties ; now the fortunes from the mines were being made by men who ate steak every night beside the white shoulders of bejeweled women ( these were the images that obsessed the stertorous dreamers of Rocas Verdes ) . The principle of the economy of energy prevailed on the mountain , including utterance . Their very card games were conducted in grunts and finger gestures . This was not entirely due to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ore . Sloth is like a viscous mineral . Under Dr. MacKenzie 's eye they were all ( except the mines ' doctor ) excellent workers , but sloth is not incompatible with a circumscribed diligence . Sloth breeds self-hatred and hatred ; these hatreds hung in the air of the club room . Under the necessity to conserve energy they seldom reached expression . Once or twice a year a man would suddenly screech with rage at another , or would go out of his mind , biting his fists and rolling on the ground . Dr. van Domelen would administer sedatives . Dr. MacKenzie , called from his hut , would save the wretched man 's face : " The fact is we 've all been working too hard , especially you , Wilson . You 've been doing splendid work , splendid . Why do n't you go down to Manantiales for a week ? Maybe Mrs. Wickersham will put you up . Even if she has n't got a room free , she 'll let you come to dinner . " Ashley , except for Dr. van @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It gave the twenty-two engineers pleasure to look  | down on his youth , to raise their eyebrows knowingly at his beginner 's enthusiasm and enterprise , and to sneer at the duties he performed . They regarded him as the " housekeeper . " He was one degree above the Chinese cook . Why did the men remain at Rocas Verdes ? At the turn of the century mines all over the world were advertising frantically for engineers . Nineteen months later , when the great friendship had begun , Ashley put the question to Mrs. Wickersham . " Well , mining engineers are an odd lot . They love ore and nothing else . They may think that they love the wealth that it promises to bring them , but no ! they love the metal . They love the act of extracting it from the groaning , shrieking mountain . Now , Rocas Verdes is a small mine ; it 's at a killing altitude , but ... the copper there is the best quality in all the Andes . Your friends up there are sour men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guts to be working in a mine that produces beautiful stuff . Everyone in the world strains to be associated with what 's best in its kind . It 's a miners ' mine . Dr. MacKenzie is known throughout the Andes as having a wonderful sense for knowing where the bloody copper is hidden and how to get it out . He could be governor of El Teniente , if he wanted to be ; but he likes it at Rocas Verdes . Mining engineers are an odd lot ; they like it to be difficult . Mr. Tolland , at my own table I 've seen men behave in Dr. MacKenzie 's presence as though they were self-conscious schoolboys in their first corduroy pants  --  and they were earning four and five times what he does . They work in vast millionaires ' mines . They have wives and children with them , and butlers , and hot shower baths ? " " We have hot shower baths now , Mrs. Wickersham . " " And whiskey-and-sodas . But they 're not really miners any more . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A true miner is taciturn , unsocial , single-minded . Generally , their wives have left them , as Dr. MacKenzie 's did . Mind you , they do n't know all these things . They think they 're like other  | men , only better . Just as they deceive themselves about the money in it . Notice how clever your company is  --  automatically raising a man 's salary every four years . It 's like a bundle of hay in front of a donkey 's nose . It gives him the illusion of getting rich . In my opinion , the real reason why the men stay there is because it 's the aristocrat of mines ; it 's so damned unendurable , detestable , and impossible ; and the copper 's first class . " There was everywhere evidence of his predecessor 's sloth . By the end of the second week he had cleaned the kitchen and improved the system supplying hot water . He made a friend of the cook and interested himself in the peculiarities of kitchen chemistry at high altitudes . He busied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was again improvising as he had done in Coaltown . He turned over old lumber and broken chairs and perforated saucepans and rejected blankets . Presumably his predecessor had been shy of requesting material from the Antofagasta office . No Ashley was ever shy . John Ashley 's monthly letters to Andrew Smith were filled with varied demands and the material began ascending the mountains . The men had been fed on salt pork and corned beef . He obtained permission to order meat and vegetables from Manantiales  --  a possibility that had not presented itself to sloth . Apples and pineapples appeared on the table . Araucanian rugs replaced Manchester drugget . He was happiest in the miners ' villages , the Chilean and the Indian . The assistants assigned to him were Bolivian Indians . He was invited to the christening of a daughter . After the banquet he asked to see the mother and child again . This was not in the customs of the tribe , but the mother and baby were brought before him . He had not held an infant in his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. van Domelen was seldom called to the native villages , least of all to the Indians ' . They were stoical by nature and possessed their own means of relieving extreme pain . Illness and death were less intimidating than his potions , his gleaming instruments ,  | the brandy on his breath , and the contempt in his eyes . He had two children in the Indian village ; their mother glided into his hut when he hung a lamp over his door . Ashley saw signs of rickets . Though it was not in his province , he ordered cod liver oil from Andrew Smith by telegraph . He received permission  --  Indian life is surrounded with all the formality of a Spanish court  --  to enter their homes . He pondered ventilation , diet , and sanitation . He recommended and rebuked . In the lanes : " Buenos , Antonio ! " " Buenos , Don Jaime ! " " Buenos , Tecla ! " " Buenos , Don Jaime ! " " Ta-hili , Xebu ! " " Ta-hili , Clez-u ! " " Ta-hili @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time did what Ashley asked of it : It sped . Mrs. Hodge had said , " Seven years . " The engineers hated him . No word of appreciation was ever expressed for the improvements he had brought about in their living conditions . He was undermining the somber pleasure they derived from the rigor of their existence . They begrudged the hours when he descended into the mines in his effort to learn their profession . He seldom joined their card games after dinner , nor did Dr. MacKenzie . The managing director rose from table , bowed formally to the men , wished them good night , and went to his hut . He alone on the mountain had a hobby . He was a reader and read far into the night . He ordered the books from Princes Street , Edinburgh ; they came to him around the Horn or were carried by railroad across the fens of Panama . He was interested in the religions of the ancient world . He read the Bible in Hebrew , The Book of the Dead in French , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days were filled with thoughts of copper , his nights with the comforting or terrifying visions of mankind . He  | was old and ugly , but on closer view and longer acquaintance less old and ugly than he first appeared to be . His nose had been broken , perhaps several times ; he limped ; his eyes and mouth were severe , but occasionally surprised the observer with some expression of deeply buried mirth or irony . He watched all the men ; he watched Ashley . One afternoon he returned to his hut to find Ashley cleaning the flue of his fireplace . " Ah ! Good afternoon , Tolland . " " Good afternoon , Dr. MacKenzie . These briquets clog up a flue in no time . " " Yes . . . yes . . . eh , Tolland , what are those tin sheets you 've put up beside the latrines ? " " Well , sir , I 've been thinking about solar heat . I 've been trying to direct some rays on those spurs of ice  --  might fill a washing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would freeze overnight , but we could take an axe to it when the sun 's up . " " Yes . . . hmm . . . I think I remember an article about collecting solar heat in some old engineering journals I have . I 'll look it up . Come around after dinner tonight . Bring a cup with you and we 'll make some tea . " That was the first of many cups of tea in Dr. MacKenzie 's hut . These visits were an administrative error on his part and he knew it . The engineers respected their managing director as much as they hated one another . His hospitality to Ashley was without precedent . They were jealous . One night during his sixth month on the hill , Ashley learned that a child had died in the Chilean village . On the previous evening there had been a small celebration of some miner 's name day . The women and children had sat crowded together in one corner of the hut while the men drank chicha . The ban on alcohol brought some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the singing and dancing and horseplay a gourd of hot chicha had been spilled over Martin Ramirez 's week-old son . Dr. van Domelen had worked over the baby for several hours in vain . Ashley knew  | the parents and went to their two-family hut . He knocked at the door and entered . There were five or six women in the room , their shawls over their heads , and some children . All the men in the village were away at work , except Martin Ramirez , who sat in a corner , more angry than sorrowful . Babies die every day . Women 's fuss . The baby lay on the floor wrapped in his mother 's coat . " Buenos ! " There was a murmur of greeting from the women and children . Ashley stood with his back to the door waiting for his eyes to become accustomed to the half-light . Soundlessly the visitors left the room to him , leaving the parents , and one old woman . He pressed a greeting from the father . " Buenos , Martin ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , Ana . " Ana was a mere girl . She had long since lost the use of one eye . Timidly she sat down on the bed beside him . " What 's the little boy 's name ? " " Senor . . . the priest has not been here . He has no name . " The priest came once a fortnight or once a month from the larger mines to the north . " Yes , but he has a name . You know his name . " ... e ... e ... " Ana 's eye moved hesitantly toward her husband . " I think . . . Martin . " She began to tremble . " Senor , he is not a Christian . " Ashley remembered that Latin Americans barely hear what is said to them unless one touches them with one 's hand . He put his fingers lightly on her wrist and spoke with surprise and reproach . " But , Ana , my daughter ! You do n't believe such foolish things ! " She glanced up at him quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ! No , senor . " " You  --  Ana ! You are not going to tell me that God-theEternal punishes babies who have not sinned ! " She did not answer .  | " Did n't you hear that the Holy Pope in Rome went up to his golden chair and said to the whole world that that was a very wrong thought ? He said that God was sorrowful that anyone would believe a thing like that . " Ashley went on at some length about this . Ana 's eye was fixed upon his face . Ashley was smiling . " Martinito is not here , Ana . " " Where is he , senor ? " " In happiness . " Ashley held out his hands as though he were holding a baby . " In the greatest happiness . " Ana murmured something . " What are you saying , mi hija ? " " He could not speak . His eyes were open , but he could not speak . " " Ana , I have four children . I know all about babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us fathers and mothers . You know that . " " Yes , senor . . . He said , ' Why ? ' " Ashley put his hand firmly on her wrist . " You are right . He said , ' Why ? ' And he said something else , too . " " What , senor ? " " ' Remember me ! ' " Ana became very agitated . She said quickly , " Oh , senor , I shall never forget Martinito , never , never . " " We do not know why we suffer . We do not know why millions and millions of people suffer . But we know one thing . You have suffered . Only those who have suffered ever come to have a heart that is wise . " " What , senor ? " He repeated the words in a low voice . Ana looked about the room , lost . She had understood Don Jaime up to that point . But this idea was too difficult to grasp . Ashley went on . " You will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old woman . And someday your children and your grandchildren will be all around you on your name day . They will say , ' Mamita Ana , you  | treasure ! ' Mamita Ana , to de oro ! ' and you will remember Martinito . The only people in the world who are really loved  --  really loved , Ana  --  are those with hearts that are wise . You will not forget Martinito ? " " No , senor . " " You will never forget Martinito ? " " Never , never , senor . " He rose to go . With a glance and the slightest gesture of a hand toward the baby she asked something of him . She asked a rite . He came from the world of great people who were rich , who ate at tables , who could read and write  --  who had been favored by GOD and who carried magic within them . Ashley was not certain that he could make the sign of the cross correctly . He had hated everything about the Coaltown church during his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hated the prayers . Out of the children 's hearing he had once muttered to Beata , " Prayers should be in Chinese . " He now recited the Gettysburg Address twice , first in a low voice , then ringingly . Ana slid to the floor on her knees . He recited , " Under the spreading chestnut tree , The village smithy stands . " He started off on a fragment from Shakespeare that Lily spoke so beautifully : " The quality of mercy is not strained , " but he got lost . He talked to Roger and then to Sophia . " I must count on you to take care of your mother . We can not understand now what has happened to us . Let us live as though we believed there were some meaning in it . Sophia , let us live as though we believed . Forget me . Put me out of your minds , and live . Live . Amen ! Amen ! " He returned to his room . He was overcome with a great weakness . He could barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell full length upon the floor . His head struck the corner of the fireplace . When he awoke four hours later he could scarcely pass his comb through his hair . The blood had dried into a mat . Ashley drank tea in Dr. MacKenzie 's hut several evenings a month . He hoped that the managing director would discuss the  | problems of mining , but his host made it quite clear that he put copper out of his thoughts at sunset . By tacit consent they refrained from talking about their colleagues ; neither wished to talk about himself . The walls were lined with books ; there remained little to discuss except the subjects proposed by their titles  --  the religions of the ancient world and of the East . Ashley was ready and even eager to hear about them , but he soon learned that he was to receive neither profit nor pleasure there . Dr. MacKenzie looked upon all human activities  --  except mining  --  with irony and detachment . Ashley never employed irony and did not understand it ; nor was he prepared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men had consoled or tormented themselves . It made him uncomfortable to hear accounts of human sacrifice delivered with a remote and superior smile  --  maidens immolated in Carthage , babies roasted before Baal , widows burned on pyres . Ashley wanted to understand such practices ; he did not even shrink from trying to imagine under what circumstances he would have participated in them . These were not smiling matters . Another thing made Ashley uneasy during these conversations . At each session , Dr. MacKenzie  --  with the regularity of one pursuing a system  --  asked him a question which both men knew to be impermissible . By time-honored convention , uprooted men in far places may occasionally volunteer a piece of information about their past lives ; they may not ask for any . Dr. MacKenzie broke this law : " May I ask , Mr. Tolland  --  have you ever been married ? " " Were both your parents born in Canada ? " Ashley lied roundly and returned the conversation to the ancient religions . He heard how every Egyptian for well over ten thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with merit earned , he might become the god Osiris . Yes , that his soul ? " MacKenzie-Osiris " or " Tolland-Osiris " ? descended the Nile in his death boat to the hall of judgment . There , if it had escaped the snapping crocodile and the snapping jackal , it was weighed on a balance . Ashley listened spellbound to the awful Negative  | Confession ( " I have not diverted water from where it should flow , " " I have not ... " ) He heard of how countless Indians believed , and were now believing , that they were reborn into the world millions of times and that , with merit earned , they would ultimately become a Bodhisattva , a Buddha . Ashley did not find these thoughts and images very strange . He seemed to be momentarily on the threshold of believing them . What he found strange was Dr. MacKenzie 's way of presenting them . Question after question rose in his mind , but he did not put them to his host . He listened . He borrowed some books and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But then , he had never been a reader . Beata was the reader . One evening he ventured a question . " Dr. MacKenzie , you say so often that the Greeks were a great people . Why did they have so many gods ? " " Well , first there 's the easy answer  --  the one they teach us at school . Whenever a new migration poured into the country or whenever they conquered another city-state or entered into a close alliance , they made a place for the foreigners ' gods among their own . Or they combined one with one of their own . Sheer hospitality . On the whole they tried to keep the principal gods down to twelve , although it was n't always the same twelve . But I think we have to look deeper than that . Wonderful people , the Greeks . " Occasionally , as now , Dr. MacKenzie dropped his ironical tone . It was a sign of earnestness that he resorted to long pauses . Ashley waited . " The twelve gods represent twelve different types of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and me . They looked at their wives and mothers and aunts . They made gods out of the various types of human personality . They put themselves on the altar . Look at their goddesses  --  mother and guardian of the hearth ; lover ; virgin ; witch out of hell ; guardian of civilization and friend of man ? " " What ? What 's that last , sir ? " " Athene . Pallas Athene . Minerva to the Romans . She does n't  | give a damn about Hera 's cooking and diapers , or about Aphrodite 's perfumes and cosmetics . She gave Greece the olive ; some say she gave it the horse . She wanted her city to be a lighthouse on a hill for all peoples and , by God , she did it . She 's a friend to good men . Mothers are no help ; wives are no help ; mistresses are no help . They want to possess the man . They want him to serve their interests . Athene wants a man to surpass himself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes did she have , sir ? " " Color eyes ? ... Hmm . . . Let me think : " Then the greyeyed Athene appeared to the far-voyaging Odysseus as an old woman , and he knew her not . " Buck up , " she said . " What are you doing sniveling by the salt sea ? Get some heart into you , boy , and do what I tell you . You shall yet return to your dear wife and your homeland ! " ' Grey eyes. ? She often gets discouraged , I think . " " Why ? " " She never wins the golden apple . It 's Aphrodite who wins the golden apple and starts making trouble . But Aphrodite often gets discouraged too , poor girl . " Here Dr. MacKenzie was shaken by his silent laughter and had to down a whole cup of tea . Tea is inebriating at high altitude . " Why should Aphrodite get discouraged ? " " Why , because she thinks that love is the whole of life ? the beginning and the ending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her gentlemen friends think so , also  --  for a short time . But after a while her gentlemen friends go off to build cities or fight wars or to dig for copper . She gets furious . She tears her pillow into strips . Poor Aphrodite ! She can find some consolation in her mirror . Do you know why I think Venus came from the sea ? " " No . " " Because a calm sea is a mirror. ? She came ashore in a shell . Do you see the connection ? Pearls . Venus is obsessed with  | jewels . That 's why she married Hephaestus . He could bring her diamonds out of the mountains . " More laughter . Ashley was beginning to have a headache . What good is conversation if it is n't serious ? " What type are you ? " asked Dr. MacKenzie abruptly . " What , sir ? " " Which of the gods do you take after ? " Ashley had no opinion . " Oh , you 're one of them , Tolland . You ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Doctor ? " " Oh , that 's easy . I 'm Hephaestus , the blacksmith . All we miners are diggers and blacksmiths . Always getting inside mountains , preferably volcanoes. ? Now which are you ? You 're not one of us miners . You only play at it . Are you Apollo ? Eh ? Healing , poetry , prophecy ? " " No ! " " Are you Ares , the warrior ? I guess not . Are you Hermes ! ? businessman , banker , lawyer , liar , cheat , newspaperman , god of eloquence , guide and companion to the dying ? No , you 're not merry enough . " Ashley was losing interest , but for politeness ' sake he found a question or two . " Dr. MacKenzie , how could a liar and a thief be of any use to people who are dying ? " " Greek , Greek . Very Greek . Each of these gods and goddesses had two sides . Even Pallas Athene can be a raging fury when she 's aroused . Hermes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mischievous though he was , he liked to conduct people to their destinations . Look at this picture . It 's an engraved gem . See him there ? He 's holding his staff in the air and leading that veiled woman by the hand . Is n't that beautiful ? " Yes , it was beautiful . " My father was a Saturn . Wise . Gave advice all day  --  on the street , in the home , and on Sundays from the pulpit . Bad advice ,  | perfectly awful advice . My mother was a Hera  --  hearth and home , nestbuilding . But a ruler  --  yes , indeed . Terrible woman . I had two brothers , both Apollos . Saturns tend to beget Apollos , have you noticed that ? " " No , sir . " " Maybe I imagine it . One of them is serving a long sentence . His light  --  his illumination  --  took the form of being an anarchist . My sister was a Diana . Never grew up . Still a schoolgirl ! Had three children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get back to you , Tolland . Maybe you take after a god in some other religion . The Greeks did n't know everything . There are types of personality that the Greeks had n't observed . They were rare in Greece so they were n't elevated to gods . Take Christianity , for instance . Christianity is a Jewish religion . Most un-Greek thing in the world . Maybe that 's where you come in . You Hebrews came along and tossed us off our thrones . You brought in that unhappy conscience of yours  --  all that damned moral anxiety . Maybe you 're a Christian . Always denying yourselves any enjoyment , always punishing yourselves . Is that it ? " Ashley made no answer . " The rest of us are fallen . We 're shorn . We 're decayed . It 's an awful thing , Mr. Tolland , to be robbed of one 's divinity ? awful ! There 's nothing left for us to do but enjoy ourselves in our miserable way . Saturns without wisdom , like my father ; Apollos without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troublemakers . Or cranky and erratic , like Mrs. Wickersham . " " Dr. MacKenzie , what 's the matter with those . . . those ' nestbuilders ' ? " " Those Heras , those Junos ? Why , they treat all their men as though they were boys  --  their husbands , their sons , and their fathers . Once they 've produced a few babies they think they know everything . They think all the problems of the human race have been solved . Their aim is to soothe . They call it ' keeping everybody happy . ' They try to rob their menfolk of sight and hearing and  | thought . Beware of the word happy ' in Hera 's mouth ; it means dozing . ' " An all but insupportable pang rent Ashley 's headache . He rose to say good night . " But , Dr. MacKenzie , you do n't believe . . . all this , do you ? " " No , of course not . But , Mr. Tolland , in Edinburgh we have a philosophers ' club . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others believe and have believed ; but if any member uses the verb in the first or second person of the present tense , he has to pay a fine . He has to put a shilling in a skull on the mantel . We soon get out of the habit . " Time did what Ashley asked of it  --  it sped . The company ruled that at the end of every eight months each engineer should descend for a month to lower altitudes to give his heart and lungs a rest . On the eve of his departure Ashley shook hands with his fellow engineers . They were unexpectedly cordial . Many persons are at their most amiable when saying goodbye . He shrank from taking formal leave of the villagers , but a deputation of men , wrapped to their noses , stood waiting for him outside the door of the club room . They gave him presents . They kissed his hands . He called on Dr. MacKenzie . " I hope you can stay at Mrs. Wickersham 's hotel . Wait a moment ! I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Doctor . I 'm going to Santiago . I 'll stop in Manantiales next time . " As Ashley was leaving the room the managing director called him back . " Tolland , do n't you think it would be a good idea if you brought back a little companion ? " " What , sir ? " " A little ' hillwife . ' You know what I mean . The company approves of it , makes provision for it . " Dr. MacKenzie was born to blunder . The friendship had  | been cooling ; he killed it . In that realm no man gives advice to a man over twenty-five  --  asked or unasked  --  and Dr. MacKenzie knew it . A dozen of the engineers , like Dr. van Domelen , had installed " native " women in the Chilean or Indian villages . The men never went into the villages ; they did not take their hill wives to the lower altitudes on their vacations ; they seldom saw their children . There was a general pretense that the system did not exist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in his own eyes , was a family man and little else . Yet he was a family man who , for reasons beyond his control , had proved to be a total failure . Was Beata protected against insult ? Did the family have enough to eat ? Did the children have adequate clothing in winter ? He was saving his money ; he would see them again in seven years . In the meantime there was one thing he could do ? one absurd impassioned thing : he could remain faithful to his wife . This was what he thought of as " holding up the walls . " Many men and women can live out their lives without any resort to superstition , magic , prayer , or fetish . They remember no anniversaries , salute no flags , and bind themselves by no oaths . They submit themselves totally to blind Circumstance , who takes away without thought what it gave without plan . Ashley 's fidelity was not supported by any vow undertaken before church or state , for  --  as we shall see later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truest virtues are supererogatory : compassion not toward the good but toward the wicked , generosity to the ungrateful , fidelity without formal commitment . Continence , for Ashley , was a deprivation like blindness or immobility . He maintained it by rigorous strategy . It was to this end that he so organized his life that he went nightly to bed " dog-tired , " " log-tired . " He governed sharply what our ancestors called his " conversation . " But any resolute person can conquer the demands of the flesh ; he had a harder battle to win . He had known only one woman ; he had had no experience of disassociating love from its train of attendants ?  | companionship , courage , consolation , unfolding knowledge , and ? in parenthood  --  creation . Time and time again on his trips southward these fair promises had been extended to him . Women had seen these expectations in his eyes . He remembered hearing in Coaltown that Dr. Gillies was accustomed to say to patients addicted to alcoholism , " Do n't deprive yourself of anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ashley felt his deprivation keenly ; in its place he put this absurd superstition  --  if he failed , the walls of The Elms " would sway , totter , and collapse . The continent  --  that is , the resolute and dedicated ones , not the pining continent  --  have a way of recognizing one another . Later , when Ashley worked himself " dog-tired , " repairing and reinforcing and embellishing Mrs. Wickersham 's hospital and schools , what friendships arose with the sisters !  --  what laughter , what complicity  --  yes , what airy courtships , what coquetry ! So Dr. MacKenzie blundered . He knew he had blundered and his contempt for Ashley turned to hate  --  one of those hatreds nourished by self-hatred . " Thank you , " said Ashley , " I 'll think it over . " In Antofagasta he changed trains without calling on Mr. Andrew Smith of the Kinnairdie Mining Company . His first task in Santiago de Chile was to find work . His appearance had altered during the eight months . He had aged  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty-two . He was blackened by the sun to the degree so rapidly acquired at high altitudes . His hair had darkened and had lost its youthful curls . The pitch of his voice was lower . He was taken for a Chilean of the Irish or German admixture so frequent in the country . He applied without success for work as a nursery gardener , a stable hand , a gravedigger , a handyman at the " Eden " pleasure park . Finally he was hired to work on the new road toward the north , toward Valparaiso and Antofagasta . When his vacation drew to an end he left the road with regret ; he had contributed to mixing and pouring the cement for twenty culverts . Again he changed trains in Antofagasta and spent the  | night in the inn he had known . The next morning he called on Mr. Andrew Smith , who did not at first recognize him and who was displeased at seeing a responsible engineer of his company wearing the clothes of a laborer . He had much to talk over with Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cautiously and , as far as possible , secretly . Mr. Smith and the mysterious Board of Directors would have suffered untold agonies if they had learned that loose idle talkers were spreading the rumor that Rocas Verdes was running into ever richer seams of ore , and that there were plans for large expansion . Ashley was directed to draw up designs and estimates for many more miners ' huts . In fact large quantities of lime and timber were already ascending the mountains . The problems of housing were discussed at length . When Ashley prepared to take his leave , Mr. Smith 's manner acquired a measure of warmth . He expressed a guarded commendation of the young man 's work . He intimated that the Board of Directors might soon give concrete expression to their appreciation . Ashley sat down again abruptly and said , " Mr. Smith , there are two things that I 'd like to propose to you . " " Indeed ? " " I think that it would be a very wise measure to announce an increase in the miners ' pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Smith stared at him angrily . " You know how many hours are lost every week because of illness . " " I do . That is malingering , Mr. Tolland . The miner is incorrigibly lazy . Dr. van Domelen has a constant struggle with them . " " No , this is different . These men are not lazy . When they are working with me on some project for their own village , it is hard to make them stop . All they need is some sign that they are respected as human beings . The Indian , sir , is subject to spells in which his mind and will ' go blank ' ? that 's the only way I know how to put it . " " That 's the way to put it  --  incorrigible laziness. "  | " His whole life stretches before him , working underground , without possibility of change . The monotony is bad enough ; the loss of hope is worse . But " ? and here Ashley rose ? " the lack of human consideration is killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their veins . The Indians do fall ill . This sense of being shut off and despised takes the form of an illness . " Mr. Smith opened and shut his lips several times ; finally he said , " A man has to earn his living on this earth , Mr. Tolland , just as you and I do . A raise in their wages is none of your concern . They 'd spend it in drink . They somehow manage to smuggle it in , I do n't know how . " Ashley walked about the room . He approached Mr. Smith 's desk and said , in a lowered voice : " Chicha is not the only thing that is smuggled in . Information finds its way in , too . I do n't know how . Our miners have heard of the wages at La Reina and San Tomas and Dos Cumbres  --  especially our Bolivian Indians , who are our best workers . You are building new huts ; you may have trouble filling them . The best investment in a mine is the selfrespect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Ore does not come to the surface by itself . ' " Mr. Smith swallowed . He shifted the pen and inkwell on his desk . He coughed . " You said you had a second suggestion . " " There should be a priest living at Rocas Verdes . Those irregular visits are n't right . " " What do they want with their wretched priests ? The priest charges them so much for a wedding and a christening that most of the miners are n't even married . They hate their priests . A visit once a month 's good enough for them . Mr. Tolland , let me tell you something : Roman Catholicism is childish superstition at best ; in Chile it 's beneath contempt . " " I think we 're all bad judges of what goes on in other people 's minds about God , Mr. Smith . It 's a bad thing to force a God on a man who does n't want one . It 's worse to stand in the way of a man who wants one badly . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ashley was seized by a splitting headache . He closed his eyes and almost fell from his chair . Again Mr. Smith stared at him as though he had been struck . If there was to be any moralizing , . Mr. Smith was accustomed to doing it . It 's what he did best . Scotland is heavily populated with Saturns . No young whippersnapper from Canada could tell him anything about religious matters . " Are you ill , Mr. Tolland ? " ! i " Might I have a glass of water , please . " Mr. Smith watched him drink . At last he said , " How would we get a priest there ? Everybody knows there are n't enough in Chile to go round . They have to ship them over from Spain . " Ashley had given no thought to this . To his own surprise he heard himself saying offhandedly ? " I suppose you write to the Bishop . Maybe you give him a present . You promise to pay the priest 's salary for the first five years  --  something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ashley went on : " Ask for a young one . Give me permission to build him a hut ; and give me permission to enlarge the chapel . It looks like a pigsty . And I think it 'd be useful in the long run if you gave me permission to stay one more day in Antofagasta so that I could look at some churches and talk to some priests . " Mr. Smith struggled with himself . When he spoke , his Scots speech , which I have omitted to reproduce , returned pronouncedly : " I give you that permission . But do n't be getting too many fancies , Mr. Tolland . " At the door Ashley  --  totally recovered , ten years younger ? turned with a smile . " Rocas Verdes could be as beautiful inside as it is  --  outside . " He flung his hand into the air as though de1 scribing a coronet of peaks . Two weeks after his return to Rocas Verdes it was announced that the miners were to receive an increase in their monthly pay . The news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the calamity that would surely accompany it . After the second  | payment , by ones and twos , they thanked Ashley . They connected it with his visit to the lowlands . Ashley said to himself , " That 's for Coaltown ! " He was a builder now . The villagers watched the enlargement of the chapel with awed eyes . There was a great deal of voluntary work at night under the glare of an acetylene lamp . Women and children could n't be persuaded to go to bed . They stood in the cold watching their husbands and fathers and sons shape a dome  --  it was a little dome , but that 's what it indubitably was . In Antofagasta Ashley had taken council with the clergy and from his own pocket had bought a crucifix , some altar cloths , and six hundred candles . When the itinerant priest arrived he was overwhelmed with requests for weddings and christenings . The candlelight fell on blissful faces , and after the services there was much parading in the lanes  --  spouses newly joined in holy wedlock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names was now recorded in Heaven 's own register . This embracing of the sacraments was not entirely the result of a higher wage , or the promise of a dome . A rumor had reached the village that they were soon to have a priest of their own  --  living among them , knowing them by name , remembering them from confession to confession , being very stern with them ( they hoped for that ) , one who also had the spirit and the authority to extend pardon  --  in short , a padre . It was for him they wished to be in fair estate , christened and married . Four months later Don Felipe arrived . Ashley kept out of sight . He had suggested to Dr. MacKenzie that it would be very well received if the managing director were the first to welcome the padre and to conduct him to his house . Dr. MacKenzie shrugged his shoulders  --  Christians , Mohammedans , and Buddhists were all one to him , all groveling before idols , seeking unmerited rewards . Ashley sat beside Don Felipe at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . It was Roger  --  not a feature alike , with no resemblance in voice , but Roger  --  perhaps six years older , like him a little stiff , unsmiling , taciturn , intensely  | alive in eye and ear , concentrated ; above all , independent . Like Roger he did n't want advice , he did n't want help , he did n't want friendship . ( Friendship , it seems , was another of the things that can be dispensed with , when one finds something better to replace it . ) Like Roger , he was of an exemplary politeness . The priest surveyed the engineers seated at the tables around him . He became aware of their contempt . He was the youngest in the room by at least eleven years . Dr. MacKenzie 's condescension took the form of asking the " child " a great many personal questions , such as no Spanish gentleman would put to another at a first or fifth meeting . Don Felipe answered them all as Roger would , simply , and with a shade of distaste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South America eight months . He had served at La Paz . He had begun the study of the Indians ' languages . He was born twenty-seven years ago , youngest of six children , in Seville . " You 'll find our miners a rather rough lot , " said Dr. MacKenzie , who was proud of his colloquial Spanish , using a word that pointed to both " disorderly " and " oafish . " Ashley caught the expression that the priest turned toward the managing director ; it contained a faint smile and seemed to say , " Oh , sir , not as oafish as you Protestants . " To Ashley he said , " Pedro Quinones tells me , Don Diego , that you have done much to enlarge the church here . " Ashley choked . " The men gave their own time , Father . " Don Felipe turned his black eyes on him and made no reply . A few minutes later he asked , " These gentlemen are from several countries ? " " Yes , Father . Our director is from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are four Germans and three Swiss . The larger number are from England and the United States . " " And you , sir ? " " For reasons I can not tell you now , I say that I am a Canadian . "  | Don Felipe received the statement as though he were accustomed to such peculiar locutions . Don Felipe was young , but he suffered from no insecurity . He arranged the next day to take his meals in the kitchen , where he established the best of relations with the Chinese cook . Like Roger , he gave all of himself to the task that was set before him . That soutane whipped about the lanes as though six priests had arrived . He had a beautiful singing voice which awoke others . There were processional litanies in the bitter cold  --  candles under the stars . The church was too small . His sermons were like journeys into a far country , dreams from which one awoke dazed and in great need of a friendly hand . He was a remorseless enemy of sin ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and yet , it was said , when he offered absolution to the penitent , strong men fainted . His greatest innovation , and difficult for the community to grasp , was his homage to women . Within a few months its effect became evident in their carriage . It became proverbial that his parishioners walked like the women of Andalucia . A number of my readers will have recognized that we are talking of the future Archbishop Felipe Ochoa , " Pastor of the Indians , " author of Rectas Facite in Solitudine ( Semitas Dei Nostri ) . Ashley had many brief encounters with the padre , but no conversations . Like Roger 's the priest 's face , in front view , was impassive ; but his profile and the back of his head were vulnerable , as it is in the young . Ashley caught intimations of his homesickness for Seville ( the beloved , the beautiful ) and for his father and mother , of his longing for his professors and fellow students at the seminary , for the services and the music at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had also made the great decision . Ashley came to divine that he had only the vaguest notion where Scotland , Switzerland , and Canada were . His education had stored his head with far more important knowledge than that . Ashley could scarcely apprehend the extent to which he carried an irrational repulsion from Protestants . He had hitherto  | seen very few in his life  --  tourists , book in hand , impiously strolling about his cathedral as though they were in a railway station . He assumed that Protestants were a despised minority on the earth 's surface , crawling about abashedly , aware of their abjection but too satanically proud to acknowledge their error . Time sped . The next eight months drew to a close ; Ashley must descend the mountains for another vacation . He received a letter from the chairman of the board informing him that he had been promoted . He was to receive the salary of a man who had worked twelve years in the mine . The Kinnairdie Company wished to retain his services . The promotion was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was engaged , of building and electrification , were in full swing . He dreaded the vacation . He submitted to a physical examination by Dr. van Domelen and was permitted to continue at Rocas Verdes for another two months . But May , 1905 , arrived and he must leave . He had every intention of returning to his post after this vacation . . . and yet ! He longed to leave the mountains forever . He rejoiced in his work , he loved his Chileans and Indians , but he was starved for companionship  --  above all , for wife and child , but that did not bear thinking of . He had been tormented lately , waking and sleeping , by a recurrent dream : on a dark night , nearer to dawn than to midnight , he was standing under their elms .. . the southeast corner room . . . he was throwing some pebbles into the window . She awoke ; she descended the stairs and opened the front door . But this was insane ! Such rashness could only involve them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? that would be July , 1909 . Ashley intended to return to Rocas Verdes , yet he packed his knapsacks as though for a final departure . He sewed his paper money into his clothing ; his salary checks he could cash in any large town . For the first time in his life he was gloating over money . His leave-takings were much the same . Again he called on Dr. MacKenzie .  | " This time you must stop at Manantiales  --  at least for a week . You must learn to know Mrs. Wickersham 's hotel . I 've telegraphed her that you were coming and here 's a letter for her . You 've heard the men talk about her ? " " A little . " " She wo n't have Heidrich again , or van Domelen or Platt . She says she ca n't stand gloomy men . There are two other passable hotels in Manantiales , but nothing on earth can compare with her Fonda . The beds , Tolland , the food , the copper-lined bathtubs , the servants ! And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little over thirty years . She got me my first job , in fact . In the early days she was the miners ' post office and banker and even employment agency . She was more than that  --  she was a sort of guardian of standards . There was a German mine  --  it 's in other hands now ? called the ' Suevia Eterna . ' Living conditions were bad ; it was arrogant to its non-German engineers , late in its pay checks  --  all that ; but it thought itself the best mine in the hills . She advised young men away from it . She abetted other mines in stealing its good men . Well , old ' Suevia ' sent a committee to call on her . She burned the skin off their scalps ; told them how to run a mine . But I 'd hate to work in any mine that she ran  --  if she ran it as she runs her hotel . One night at the Fonda an American businessman was telling us all that the white man was the masterwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into the world to be his servant help . She made him finish his dinner upstairs . He had to leave the next morning and she would n't let him pay his bill . " " She 's English ? " " Yes , born in the late thirties , I expect . Came out here as a bride . Husband was one of these emerald hunters . She told a story once of cooking for a lot of men over in the Peruvian oriente where it never stops raining  --  in a thatched hut , holding an umbrella over her tapir stew ; and of being in some diggings higher up than this , where you have to learn from scratch how to boil an  | egg . Husband died , leaving her with a little girl ; she opened the Fonda . Three things interest her : her hospitals and orphanages ; good company and good talk at her dinner table ; and her reputation for knowing everything that 's going on in the Andes. ? By the way , have you got a cravat ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . She insists on men wearing a cravat at dinner . " " Thank you. ? Which of the goddesses of Greece does she resemble , Dr. MacKenzie ? " " Oh , you remember that little discussion , do you ? Well , I once expounded the whole theory to her . " Here Dr. MacKenzie fell into his soundless laughter . " She told me that I was an old fool . She told me each man belongs to one type : that 's why we 're so tiresome . But that most women were all five or six goddesses mixed up together . She said that every woman wanted to be an Aphrodite , but she had to settle for what she could get . She said that she 'd been all of them  --  all six . She said that it 's a lucky woman who graduates from Artemis to Aphrodite , to Hera and ends up as Athene . It 's sad when they get stuck in one image. ? Come back and tell me what you think . " On the night before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was intensely cold . He came to the church and pushed open the door . All was dark but for a lighted wick burning in its cup of red glass . It cast a faint reflection on the little dome above it . Don Felipe was kneeling before it , unfathomably motionless . Ashley returned to the square . He was smiling . To himself he said , " That 's for Roger . " He was filled with awe  --  with grateful wonder  --  that life permits us to pay old debts , to redeem old blindnesses , old stupidities . His grandmother had promised him that . Ashley had no intention of going to the Fonda . He told himself he was no fool . When he arrived at Manantiales the sun was about to sink beneath the Pacific . He walked under trees and low-  | flying birds . The descent from the heights left him drowsy . With stealth he slowly approached the inn and entered the garden . He sank down on a bench . A fountain was rising from a pool at his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights appeared in the windows . He thought of the sala of white and deep-sea blue . He thought of the crucifix on the wall . Most of all he thought of Mrs. Wickersham . He was longing for someone to talk with . He was longing for friendship . " All right , " he said , rising . " I 'll risk my life for it . " He straightened his shoulders and walked into the front hall . She was sitting by a lamp in her little office , bent over her account books . She looked up and saw him . Again she asked him in the tones of a drill sergeant , " Who are you ? " " James Tolland , ma'am , from Rocas Verdes . I have a letter to you from Dr. MacKenzie . " " Come in here , please . " She took the green shade off the lamp so that the light would fall fully upon him . She looked him up and down . " Have n't I seen you before ? " " No , ma'am . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed her face . She went into the hall , clapped her hands , and called " Tomas ! Tomas ! " An Indian boy came running toward her . She gave her directions in the dialect of the sierra . " Move Doctor Pepper-andSalt to Number Ten damn-damn quick . Tell Teresita to make Number Four perfect like Heaven and the Angels . When Number Four is ready , carry hot water to the bath and come to me. ? Mr. Tolland , your room and bath will be ready in fifteen minutes . Your room is Number Four at the top of those stairs . Here are some San Francisco papers to read while you 're waiting . Dinner is at nine . You can go to sleep . Tomas will knock at your door at a quarter before nine . If you want a drink before dinner , be sure that it is half strength . The first twenty-four hours after a descent are tricky . " " Thank you , Mrs. Wickersham. "  | He turned and went toward the sala . At the door he turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer hanging on the wall . In his astonishment , in his consternation , Ashley let the newspapers fall from his hand . Mrs. Wickersham had been following him with her eyes . She knew very well why , three minutes earlier , she had made room for him at the Fonda . There was nothing particularly prepossessing about John Ashley ; Dr. MacKenzie 's telegram and letter carried little weight with her . She accepted him because he had lied to her . She remembered very well that they had seen each other before . She had forgotten whatever words they had exchanged , but she was sure of the fact . It was n't merely the lie that arrested her now , it was the sturdiness of the lie , its " sincerity . " Mrs. Wickersham was , as Dr. MacKenzie had said , " choke-full " of curiosity . She knew that Ashley was not a liar and that he had lied to her . She wanted to know more about that . She never joined her guests at lunch . She descended at nine o'clock wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer in their first youth , decked out with bugles of jet and scarlet velvet bows . The first three evenings she placed Ashley far from her at the lower end of the table . She watched him and was sorry that she had asked him into the house . He spoke very little . He listened to Swiss botanists and Swedish archaeologists and Baptist missionaries , to businessmen and engineers ( including a compatriot from Canada ) and those eternal professional world travelers already composing their chapter on the " Land of the Condor . " She placed him beside the Chilean doctor at her hospital and the mayor of Manantiales . He was n't a man 's man . Men merely tried to impress him with their wealth or position . Women liked him , but women like any man who will give them his whole attention . She would let him stay out the week . On the fourth night she seated him at her left and there he remained . " Mr. Tolland , what were you doing in my kitchen today ? " " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you do ? " " I put it out . I want your permission to go into the kitchen and laundry every day until they 're in order . These earthquakes have shaken up your pipes and flues and boilers . I saw some places that could be dangerous . " " In Chile gentlemen do n't soil their hands , Mr. Tolland . I have repairmen and plumbers of my own . " He looked her in the eye . " Yes , I 've seen their work . . . . Mrs. Wickersham , I 'm a tinker . And I 'm miserable when I have n't anything to do . I want you to show me your orphanages and hospitals  --  all those parts that the visitors do n't see . Before the boilers blow up and the drains overflow . " " Gosh ! " He changed to his workingman 's clothes . He collected some assistants and tools . He was introduced to the sisters and the teachers and the cooks and the doctors . By the end of the week there was a sawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the second week partitions were removed and partitions were installed . The sisters were particularly delighted when he made them shelves , dozens of shelves . He cleaned fireplaces and wells and latrines . He sang " ' Nita , Juanita " and " No gottee tickee , No gettee shirtee , at the Chinee laundryman 's . " To himself he said , " This is for Sophia . " He looked younger every day . He was greeted with blushes and laughter when he arrived in the morning , " Don Jaime , el canadiense . " The wards knew him . The schoolchildren knew him . The blind girls were directed to rise and sing to him . The astonishment increased that so obviously important a personage spoke their language so well and that he deigned to labor . In the wards and on the sun terrace he would stop and talk to the amputated young and to the aged . He seemed to have a genius for remembering names . Early , before his hands and clothes were dirty , he would pick up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | He belonged to that order of human beings from whom come hope and reassurance . What particularly struck Mother Superintendent was his deference to girls and women , an indefinable homage that was like something remembered from old legends and ballads . Mrs. Wickersham defended her heart as best she could . The old are slow to believe that the young can repose a real friendship in them . At best the young can be polite , but are in a hurry to rejoin their coevals . Besides , they  --  the old  --  draw back from the demands that a new friendship might exact ; they have seen so many fade , have begun to forget the valued ones . It may be that friendship is little more than a fatigued and fatiguing word . What then was the energy in the glance that Ashley turned toward her ? Was that , really , friendship ? Moreover , Ashley arrived at the Fonda at the moment when Mrs. Wickersham was losing control of her life 's rudder . She had begun to weary of well doing . All those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind whom she had taught lacemaking and weaving . Ale , Ale , Ale ! The times she had been awakened at four in the morning for one thing or another  --  to save a boy from the brutality of the police , or a member of the police force from the resentment of the workers . She was a citizen of Chile and had received ribbons of recognition from a grateful republic . She had appealed to the President himself to extend clemency to some half-mad worker who had desecrated a church or some distraught girl who had hurled her baby into a cistern . Doers of good have their seasons of weakness . They know that there is no spiritual vulgarity equal to that of expecting gratitude and admiration , but they allow themselves to be seduced by the sweet fantasies of self-pity . " No one has ever done anything for me , spontaneously . " She had lost touch with the emotion which had first prompted her to these works . Sorriest of all , she had grown weary of women and woman talk , of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exaggerating both  --  of their helplessness when confronting a choice between two evils . And , like  | all persons of resolute mind and long experience , she had become impatient at the presence of independence in others . She had become bad company to herself . She had invited cynicism into her thought ; her tongue had become malicious . She had decided to devote what few years remained to her to enjoying herself  --  to the only enjoyments left to her : to trying to rule others ' lives and to making of herself a " character . " She was fashioning a mask for her face  --  Mrs. Wickersham , amusing , a little frightening , and always right , wise , and admirable . Some go forward and some go back . A sort of insolence in regard to the opinions of others expressed itself in her wearing , in the evening , a decollete that had gone out of fashion for half a century and in a free application of the rabbit 's foot and rouge . And then John Ashley arrived at the Fonda and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play cards ? " " Yes , ma'am . " " Once in a while we play cards in the smoking room . We play for money . I do n't want the Fonda to be known as a gambling hell , so I 've made a rule : no player can win more than twenty dollars . Any profits he makes above that must go into the jar for my hospital . Do you play dos picaros ? " " Yes . " " We 're playing tonight at midnight . " At last Ashley could play without dissembling his skill . There were some rich men at the table  --  world travelers , landowners in the valley , and nitrate and copper men . He took their money . He took Mrs. Wickersham 's money . A slate hung on the wall . At the end of the evening she wrote on it the sum accruing to the hospital . Her eyes glittered . A hundred and eighty dollars ! A Roentgen-ray machine cost six hundred dollars . A few days later : " Mr. Tolland , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ma'am . "  | " Come on up on the roof after dinner . I have some good rum . We 'll talk . " So began the late conversations under the stars . They sat facing the mountains , with the jug on a low table between them . The peaks  --  sightless , noble , and long enduring  --  seemed to await their next event , to be leveled , or riven and folded . It was spring . At intervals from the distance could be heard a susurrus , a faint thunder , and a plop  --  some avalanche of ten thousand tons . With the moonrise glory suffused heaven and earth . The peaks came alive ; they seemed to sway and sing , serene fields between black pinnacles . ( " Beata should see this ! The children should see this ! " ) The conversations were about Chile , about the early days of mining , about the hospitals and schools , about men and women . Ashley , fatigued by the hard day 's work , rejoiced in grateful friendship , but Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotions . Who was he ? What was his story ? The more she loved him the more she resented his refusal to talk about himself . She had visited his room in his absence and examined his possessions . She had come upon some faded blue photographs ? in one a tall young woman was standing by a pond holding a baby in her arms ; three young children sat at her feet . Even in the worn print she could read health , beauty , and harmony . She studied it a long time with something near to bitterness . To anyone else in the world she  --  the " dragon , " the " tartar " ? would have put direct questions ( " What are you doing down here without your family ? " " Why did you lie to me ? " ) , but she was a little afraid of Ashley . At moments she was so filled with enraged frustration that she was on the point of ordering him out of the hotel . She had had a long experience of fugitive men ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their number . On the fifteenth night of Ashley 's stay there was a long discussion at the dinner table of the " rat list " ? its celebrities past and present , the money that could be earned at rat catching , and the unremitting attention necessary for the hunt .  | Toward seven in the evening on that day an unaccustomed bustle and noise had been heard in the corridors of the Fonda , laughter from the houseboys and smothered shrieks from the girls . A favorite guest of the house had arrived , the famous Mr. Wellington Bristow , a businessman , owner of an import-export office in Santiago de Chile . He was an American citizen , he said , born in Rome of an English father and a Greek mother , but he had been heard to describe his origins differently . He carried a score of business cards in his pockets announcing that he was sole representative in Chile of certain American pharmaceuticals , of Scotch woolens , of a French perfume , a Bavarian beer , and so on . He was a general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His small head was covered with short curls and was set on the wide shoulders of an athlete . Around the card tables at midnight he looked thirty , at dinner forty , but at noon he could have passed for sixty , for his face then appeared anxious and tired , etched by innumerable small lines , not all of them the gift of laughter . He was dressed in the height of the London fashion of thirty years ago , favoring brightly colored vests and checkered trousers . He had restless jeweled hands that attracted aces . His linen was not always snowy ; his cuffs were frayed . He was ceaselessly occupied in making money and often hungry . He was the best company in the world . Wellington Bristow was every inch a businessman and a genius at it , but he loved negotiation more than money ; he was of a generous nature ; and he was joyous . Hence he had three strikes against him . He had to complicate a transaction , draw in third parties , bury it under provisos and " riders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hint of a bribe or to threaten the recalcitrant with an intimation of blackmail . Inflating promises and concealing risks were a pleasure . He sacrificed his very commissions to render the deal more exciting . He loved business for its own sake . What little money he had he could not keep . He was constantly giving presents he could not afford , which is the soul of generosity . On each of his visits to the Fonda he brought Mrs. Wickersham some-  | thing new and delightful from the great world  --  the first typewriter seen in Manantiales , the first fountain pen , the first caviar , an evening cloak by Worth . On this trip he arrived with ten bottles of champagne ; there were holes in his shoes and socks . No one has ever seen a successful businessman who is joyous , for joy is praise of the whole and can not exist where there are ulterior aims . His joy was of the purest sort ; it stole its gaiety from dejection and danger . What a talker he was , what a persuader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The great persuaders are those without principles ; sincerity stammers . The first Ashley knew of Mr. Bristow 's presence in the house was the sound of Mrs. Wickersham 's voice , raised in indignation , from the hall below : " No , Mr. Bristow , I will not have a coffin ! I do n't care whether it 's made of ebony or not , I will not have it in the house ! " But that was merely one of Mr. Bristow 's jokes . The ten bottles of champagne had been brought into the Fonda in a long narrow box , yet . . . yet it was not entirely a joke . Mr. Bristow 's thoughts ran on deathbeds , coffins , and funerals . In these matters he was not only serious , but of a high calming gravity . He haunted the dwellings of the moribund . He eased their passage and awoke a longing for the farther shore . He stepped aside for the viaticum , tapping his foot impatiently , but on many fading eyes the last image was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The people of Santiago , of all classes , would knock at his door at any hour and beg him to write words to be inserted in the newspapers with the announcement of a death . Some of them have passed into proverbial lore : " Strangers , only those who have known great joy can know our grief . Family of Casilda Romero Valdes , " " Stranger , pause : death is not bitter to those who have watched the suffering of their child . Family of Mendo Casares y Castro . " Wellington Bristow came to Manantiales three or four times a year . Manantiales was a " little Amsterdam " of the Andes , a  | market and outlet , mostly clandestine , for emeralds which found their way , westward bound , over the passes . An underground route to the capitals of the world passed through a number of squalid huts at the edge of the town . Mr. Bristow picked up emeralds at Manantiales , before climbing higher for chinchilla pelts . Mrs. Wickersham looked forward to his visits . He brought the gossip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card tables ; and he teased and left unsatisfied her abounding curiosity concerning himself . Who was he ? Who was he , really ? He published his news for her at table on the first evening . She seated him at a distance from her so that the whole company could enjoy his chronicles : trials , bankruptcies , deaths and funerals ( " I do n't want to hear about funerals , Mr. Bristow ! " ) , imprisonments , hurried marriages ( " Orange blossoms will burst into bloom prematurely , Mrs. Wickersham , if you light a fire under them . " " I know that , Mr. Bristow " ) , guns fired in bedrooms , forged wills , leper wins lottery , deaths and funerals ( " I do n't want to hear about funerals , Mr. Bristow ! " ) , miraculous cures before suburban altars , Inca princess unmasked as Miss Beatrice Campbell of Newark , New Jersey , the newest modes ( cartwheel hats and knuckle-length sleeves ) , deaths and funerals ( " Stop it right now ! " ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Have you caught any rats lately , Mr. Bristow ? " " No ma'am , but a friend of mine caught a big one in Lima a few months ago . " " Mr. Tolland , do you know what the ' rat list ' is ? " " Yes , ma'am . " " What 's this story about Lima , Mr. Bristow ? " " Just my bad luck , Mrs. Wickersham . He 'd have come south soon . I 've been watching out for him for two years . He was vice president of a Kansas City bank  --  blue eyes , round face , pink complexion , about forty years old . He 'd run off with several hundred thousand dollars and a sixteen-year-old girl . " " What 's the cauliflower ? "  | " There 'll be four or five thousand from the bank and as much from the girl 's family . It was the carbuncle scars on the back of his neck that gave him away . My friend put some pills in his liquor and pulled his scarf off. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that ? " " They found him in Alaska where he was cooking in a hotel . Happy as an eel in a pie  --  that 's what they said . He 'd always wanted to cook . His wife would n't pay the cauliflower . She did n't want him back . She already had a cook , she said . " " How many names are on your list now ? " " Oh , hundreds , Mrs. Wickersham . Some of them go back thirty years . We 're only interested in the big prizes . It keeps you on your toes . Like the man who kidnaped Mrs. Beecham in ninetynine . He was thirty years old , then , and looked like Pete Dondrue , the jockey , they said . " " Any marks ? " " Just a little peculiarity I ca n't mention here , Mrs. Wickersham . " " Well , you keep your eyes open . You 'll pick up some cauliflower yet . " Mr. Bristow was at his happiest at the card tables , and would have won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played neither for money nor for victory , but to circumvent the rules of the game . Ashley left it to the others to expose his cheating . Caught , Mr. Bristow would merely laugh ? " I wondered if you 'd see that ! " All faces turned toward Mrs. Wickersham , the " dragon , " who would have sent any other guest flying from the house . " Oh , he 's a rascal ! I 've known it for years . Play the game correctly , Mr. Bristow , or out you go ! " Mr. Bristow took a decided fancy to Ashley , who liked him in the guarded and flattered way we often do those invested with qualities opposite to our own . Four days later Wellington Bristow left on a brief trip up in the hills . He hoped to pick up some chinchilla pelts . He looked  | forward to passing an evening with his old friend Dr. MacKenzie at Rocas Verdes . A departure is a pretext for a party and there was drinking and storytelling in the bar after Mrs. Wickersham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storytelling . They were true stories  --  all of them had befallen Mr. Bristow in various parts of the world . For the first hour they had to do with narrow escapes from death . They turned on wonders and coincidences . He had escaped drowning and burning houses ; he had been rescued in the nick of time from murder at the hands of brigands . Ashley was the sole listener , for the others had fallen asleep  --  the nitrate merchant , the botanist , and Mrs. Hobbes-Jones ( author of A Child 's Asia , A Child 's Africa , and so on ) . Finally , Mr. Bristow asked him in a low voice , " Have you ever been close to death , Mr. Tolland ? " " No , " said Ashley , " I ca n't say I have . " Bristow then went on to stories of deaths he had witnessed that arrived opportunely , at some right moment  --  deaths that beautifully crowned an enterprise or averted disgrace , or that lifted an intolerable burden . His eyes glowed , he appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We did not choose the day of our birth ; we may not choose the day of leavetaking . They are chosen . " Ashley had given little thought to death . He listened absorbedly  --  as his children had listened to him tell stories about Little Ib 's adventures at the North Pole and Little Susanna 's Trip to the Moon  --  and , like his children , he fell asleep . The next morning when Bristow was leaving the Fonda , Mrs. Wickersham stopped him at the door . " What were you doing in Mr. Tolland 's room yesterday afternoon , Mr. Bristow ? " " I ? I ? ? I do n't even know where his room is ! " " I asked you what you were doing in his room . " " Oh , I remember . Was that Tolland 's room ? I just wanted to borrow some ink . "  | " What did you take from his room ? " " Nothing . " " I was told you were there twenty minutes . " " Twenty minutes ! I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like my guests disturbed. ? How many days will you be away ? " " Five days , six at the most . " She turned away without saying goodbye . As soon as he was gone she called Tomas . " Did Mr. Bristow leave some luggage in the storeroom ? " " Yes , Padrona . " " I want to be sure it 's safe . Put it upstairs in my room . " It was not the first time Mrs. Wickersham had gone through Mr. Bristow 's luggage . She found a copy of the rat list . On the last page there was an entry underscored by a red crayon . " ASHLEY , JOHN B. Born Pulley 's Falls , New York , about 1862 . Five feet eight ? 180 lbs . Brown hair . Blue eyes . Vertical scar on right jaw . Educ . Type ; Eastern accent . Mining engineer , Coaltown , Ill . Wife and 4 ch . Shot Breckenridge Lansing , his employer , in the back of the head , May , 1902 . Sentenced  --  Escaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22 . Dangerous character , connected with criminal associates . Reward , State 's Attorney 's Office , Springfield , Illinois , 3000 . Additional reward , 2000 , J. B. Levitt , Brockhurt , Levitt , and Levitt , P.O. Box 64 , Springfield , Ill . " Mrs. Wickersham leaned long over this material . She closed her eyes , as though overcome by a great weariness . It was not the first time she had asked herself the question to which she could furnish several answers ? " Why are good men stupider than bad men ? " During that hour she erased from her memory and her heart a speech that she had been preparing . She laid it away as some girl  --  hearing that her future husband had been killed ? would carry a wedding dress to the attic . The speech had been  | shaped and embellished by many rehearsals . She had intended delivering it that night , beside the jug of rum on the roof of her hotel .. " Mr. Tolland , leave Rocas Verdes and come to Manantiales to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my interests in the town . You 're a blessing to the schools and hospitals already . We do n't know how we 'll get on without you . Besides , with you I could do a great many things I have n't had the time or the wits to do by myself . The water from the Santa Catalina spring has extraordinary properties . We could bottle it and sell it by the trainload . In addition , we could build a great sanatorium . People should come and bathe here . Manantiales could be a small city of healing and happy industry . " The speech went on , even more swelling , more visionary , at each rehearsal . " Since I 've been here we 've taught more than a thousand children . They marry ; they have children ; they open stores and inns and stables throughout the whole province . They farm . But that 's not enough . What we need is a school to prepare teachers . The mixture of Spanish and Indian blood makes a very fine stock . By themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have a keen psychological intelligence and a readiness to help one another . The colonials are active , but they are vain and non-cooperative . Both are at their best  --  when they 're mixed  --  in this climate and at this altitude . Come , Mr Tolland , let us make a college , a medical school , and a city of healing . Let us build for the future when Manantiales will be an example and a model for all the provinces in Chile and in the Andes . " That was the speech she never delivered . Presently she rose , replaced the rat list in Mr. Bristow 's luggage , ordered her horse to be brought to the door , put on her black Spanish hat , and pinned a red rose on her lapel . She rode into town and was closeted for an hour with Dr. Martinez of the hospital . She directed him to order a coffin generously designed  | for a man five feet and eight inches tall , to be placed in the farthest hut reserved for contagious patients . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and resolute had come into her voice and manner . From the doctor 's office she went to that of the Mother Directress . From there she caught a glimpse of Ashley and his crew at work on the new laundry , but she stayed out of his field of vision . She had nothing , for the present , to say to him . Sister Geronima began describing to her how Don Jaime was raising the level of the troughs , " so the girls wo n't have back aches . And , Padrona , he lowered the desks of the lace makers . He has such a feeling for the right height ! " But Mrs. Wickersham cut these praises short and talked of more important matters . At the Fonda the guests were informed that dinner would be delayed until nine-thirty . Mrs. Wickersham dressed with more than her usual care . She wore her opal earrings and a dress which few of her guests had seen before . It was white . She had worn it on the occasion when the President of her country had conferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her close friends ( but what close friends had she ? They were dead ; her daughter was in India ) would have known that this uncalled-for " dressing-up " was a sign of dejection  --  her wearing the decoration pointed to despair . She directed Ashley to sit opposite her at the foot of the table , between a Finnish botanist and his wife . Her eyes rested on him from time to time as from a great distance . At dessert the guests were served Mr. Bristow 's champagne . She gave her attention intermittently to an eminent German geographer at her right . The conversation about the table became more animated . Ashley and his Finnish friends were enjoying themselves . " What are you young people talking about down there ? " she called . " Mrs. Wickersham , " said Ashley , " Dr. and Mrs. Tihonen have some splendid ideas for the trees we should plant all up and down the valley . They 're going to give me a list and a map . "  | The table fell silent at this sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German geographer , clapping his hands . " There are few satisfactions greater than the planting of trees . " The Tihonens clapped their hands . Everyone clapped except Mrs. Wickersham . Dr. von Strelow continued : " It is the planting of crops that separates man from the animal . The animal does not know there is a future ; he does not know that he will die . We die , but the orchard survives . The planting of trees is the least self-centered of all that we do . It is a purer act of faith than the procreation of children . Dr. Tihonen , come with us tomorrow and show us those groves and forests we shall never see . " Again the table applauded . " But , Mrs. Wickersham , you should do more than plant trees in this beautiful valley . You should found a city . " " What ? " " Five miles down the valley  --  a new town . My life study , gracious lady , is to describe the conditions favorable to man  --  to his body , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain here , but you have all these hot and cold springs . There can never be a large city here ; your agriculture will be limited ; but you have a perfect environment for things of the mind . I can see a university here and a crown of hospitals and medical schools and hotels . I can see a concert hall and a theatre . The people from the cities on the coast will come up here to renew the spirit . There ? five miles down the valley . I will show you the place tomorrow . You have done admirable things here in Manantiales , Mrs. Wickersham . Now you must do still more remarkable things there . " The guests raised their glasses and shouted . " What shall we call this town of light and healing ? I fear that Mrs. Wickersham is too modest to let us call it by her name . Let us call it Athens  --  Atenas . I will bequeath my library to the university . "  | " I will give it my collection of the plants of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give five thousand dollars to it right now , " said the mining engineer at Mrs. Wickersham 's left . Throughout this rhapsody Mrs. Wickersham had been clutching the edge of the table with tense fingers . She rose and said , unsmilingly , " We shall have coffee in the club room , ladies and gentlemen . " The coldness in her voice deflated the company 's elation . They looked into one another 's faces like children rebuked . She led the way from the room with head high and lowered eyes . When coffee was passed she said to Ashley , " I must see you on the roof at midnight . There is something I must tell you . " After some struggle with herself she addressed her guests : " I want to thank Dr. von Strelow and Dr. Tihonen for the beautiful plans they have made for the valley . And I want to thank you all for the good will you 've brought to them . " She had something further to say , but could not complete her speech . On the roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time . Ashley knew that there was something weighty in the air . " Mr. Tolland , are you a man the police are hunting for ? " " Yes , I am . " " Are you on Mr. Bristow 's rat list ? " " I suppose I am . I 've never seen it . " " You feel fairly certain that you will not be caught ? " " No . I take the risk . I 'd rather take the risk than spend my life running . I 'm not running from myself . I 'm innocent of the charge that was brought against me . " " Mr. Tolland , have you missed anything from your room lately ? " " Well , the fact is , I 'm certain that someone stole some photographs I valued . "  | " Has anything else unusual happened that might be connected with that ? " ? " Yes , I was wondering whether I should tell you about it . A few nights ago in the club room someone put some kind of drug in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that night  --  hours later  --  I was wakened by someone in my room . I could hardly drag myself awake . Someone was pulling my beard . There was a light on  --  a man was moving around , maybe two men . All I knew was that I was struggling to get this man 's hand off my chin . The man  --  or the men  --  were laughing . You might say , giggling . I struck back at him , but there was no strength in my arm . Then they went away . At first I thought it had been a nightmare . I could scarcely get out of bed to light the lamp . It was no nightmare . The furniture had been pushed about . " " How do you explain it ? " " Oh , I think it was some practical joke of Mr. Bristow 's . " " If you 're on the rat list , Mr. Tolland , there may be some scar to identify you by . " Ashley put his hand up to his right jaw . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then stared at her in the darkness . " So that was it ! " " He wants to collect the money on your head , Mr. Tolland . " " How would he do it ? " " He carries some kind of document around with him . He 's honorary deputy sheriff of some town in the States . It has probably no official value whatever , but it 's enough to impress the police down here . It 's covered with ribbons and seals and flags and eagles . " " What will he do now ? " " He 's gone up to Rocas Verdes to talk you over with Dr. MacKenzie . " " Dr. MacKenzie 's my friend . " " Mr. Tolland , Dr. MacKenzie would betray anyone for the sheer pleasure of it. ? What time is it ? "  | Ashley lit a match , " A quarter past one . " " Please light the lamp . . . . I found the rat list in Mr. Bristow 's luggage . I copied out the description of yourself . Read it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me about this before ? You think you are lucky . You think some special providence watches over you . There are no special providences , Mr. Tolland ; there 's simply our wits . Why did n't you trust me ? Friendship is for those who earn it . You are in very great danger . Since you have been found out , there is only one thing to be done : James Tolland must die . John Ashley and James Tolland must die a good thoroughly certified death . The whole world must be convinced of it so that this search for you will be over . We are going to forge some documents for you . We are going to spirit you away across the desert to a little harbor called Tiburones up near the Peruvian border . Some small nitrate boats put in there . They 'll take you to Central America . You 'll be a Chilean who had a German mother . Have you any money ? " " I have more than I know what to do with . " " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a rare and terrible disease . I 've chosen one that 's not contagious ; otherwise , I 'd have to lock everybody up in quarantine . You 've heard of poison ivy . Well , we have something ten times worse than poison ivy . You are going to die of the tachaxa espinosa rash , in perfect agony , Mr. Tolland . Dr. Martinez will write your death certificate . The Mayor and your friend Mother Laurencia and myself will sign it . The consul 's office in the capital will register it . Newspapers all over the world will publish it . That escaped convict John Ashley  --  the terror of decent men and women  --  is dead . You will have a glorious funeral . You will be buried near me in almost consecrated ground . Then you will be born again . Drink your rum . " " I have n't finished the laundry . " Mrs. Wickersham snorted . " You have n't helped me build the new Atenas . Life is a series of disappointments , Mr. Tolland . Life is a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of  | talking . My voice is tired . I want you to tell me this story about your killing a man and this other story about your escaping from your guards . " He talked for half an hour . He finished the story and fell silent . " Well ! " she said . " Well ! ? someone else shot him . " " There was no one else around . And even if there had been , he could n't have shot him at exactly the same second . Only one shot was heard . " " You have no idea who those rescuers were ? " " None . " " They were miners who felt indebted to you .... " " Oh , Mrs. Wickersham , miners spend their lives underground . They 're not quick on their feet . They 're not quick in the head . They could n't plan a thing like that and carry it out  --  like circus acrobats . " " Mr. Tolland , it 's very strange . It makes me feel twenty years younger . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I did n't feel that things like miracles were happening all around me . Of course , there 's an explanation for what you 've told me ? but explanations are for people who carry dull minds through dull lives . I feel thirty years younger . But I was very unhappy at dinner  --  hearing all that nonsense about building a university here and a medical school  --  and even a concert hall and a theatre ! In all my dreaming I never got as far as that ! ? and of how we must found a city ! And who 's to do all that  --  a woman of seventy and you , a man who ca n't show his face in public ? That old fool of a professor wants to locate this Atenas here in this valley where we have two hundred earthquakes a year . Earthquakes start fires . Ceilings fall in . The churches collapse so often that they do n't try to build domes any more . . . . Opera ! Singers ca n't catch their breath at this altitude . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and recovering the train of her thought . " Do you know why we have so many earthquakes ? Because  | the Andes are rising higher . Soon they 'll be higher than the Himalayas . They 'll be the highest mountains ever seen . But sun and ice will reduce them again . They say the Alps are already crumbling away . It 'll be as flat as your hand here before you can say ' Jack Robinson . ' A few little Atenases , like the original Athens , will have had their day . Cities come and go , Mr. Tolland , like the sand castles that children build upon the shore . The human race gets no better . Mankind is vicious , slothful , quarrelsome , and self-centered . If I were younger and you were a free man , we could do something here  --  here and there . You and I have a certain quality that is rare as teeth in a hen . We work . And we forget ourselves in our work . Most people think they work ; they can kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atenas , but they 're only shining their own shoes . When I was young I used to be astonished at how little progress was made in the world  --  all those fine words , all those noble talkative men and women , those plans , those cornerstones , those constitutions drawn up for ideal republics . They do n't make a dent on the average man or woman . The wife , like Delilah , crops her husband 's hair ; the father stifles his children . From time to time everyone goes into an ecstasy about the glorious advance of civilization  --  the miracle of vaccination , the wonders of the railroad . But the excitement dies down and there we are again  --  wolves and hyenas , wolves and peacocks. ? What time is it ? " She was ashamed of herself . She was crying . She had n't shed a tear for thirty , maybe forty , years . Yet she was laughing , too , the long low almost soundless rumble that so often accompanied her thoughts when she was alone . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we are the slaves of hope. ? Well , the evening 's over and I 'm drunk . Mr. Tolland , you must go to bed now . You 're going to wake up a very sick man . At about seven-thirty you are going to be carried through the streets on a stretcher so that the whole world can see that you 're dying . Here 's some red ink . Rub it on your chest and es-  | pecially at the base of your throat . You will have great buboes in your armpits and in your groin . Paint them red . And here 's some black ink . The inside of your mouth must turn black . When you 're lying on that stretcher keep your mouth wide open . We must all see you buried before Mr. Bristow returns . I 'll come and visit you tomorrow afternoon , after you 're dead , to tell you what happens to you next . Good night , Mr. Ashley . " He put his glass down , still smiling . " I 'll be back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! There 'll be other fools  --  another Ada Wickersham , another John Ashley , and another Wellington Bristow , of course . " Soon after four in the morning Mrs. Wickersham was awakened by a loud knocking on her door . It was Tomas . " What is it ? " " Padrona , the police are taking Don Jaime away . " " Which police ? " " Captain Rui and Ibanez and Pancho . " " Tell Captain Rui to stay right there until I come . Who else is there ? " " Don Velanton " ( " Velanton " for Wellington ) . " Don Velanton went away this morning . " " He is here . " " Tell Captain Rui to wait with his prisoner in the sala until I come . Tell him I said to him , ' Remember Fernan . ' " Fernan was the captain 's son . Mrs. Wickersham had extricated him from a grave predicament . She made them wait . She dressed slowly . Twenty minutes later she entered the sala . Ashley , handcuffed , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost sobbing . " Mrs. Wickersham , Mr. Tolland is a famous criminal . He shot his best friend ? " " I thought you left Manantiales this morning . " " ? in the back of the head . He is a very dangerous person . " " Button up your clothes ! " This phrase , frequently exchanged  | by boys in their horseplay , is used among adults as an expression of supreme contempt . " Mrs. Wickersham ! ! ! " " Captain Rui ! " " Yes , Padrona . " " How is your wife ? " " Well , Padrona . " " How are Serafina and Luz ? " " Well , Padrona . " " How is Fernan ? " The captain replied in a lower voice , " Well , Padrona . " " Good morning , Pancho . Good morning , Ibanez . " " Good morning , Padrona . " Silence . " I saw your mother yesterday , Pancho . I think she is recovering , I think she 's doing very well . " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Padrona . " She sat down and gazed weightily before her . Her eyes avoided Ashley 's and Bristow 's . " Captain Rui , I have directed a hotel in Manantiales for many years . It has not been easy . I am a woman  --  alone  --  a helpless woman . I could not have done it without the help of some strong and honorable men  --  like yourself , Captain Rui . " ( " Oh , my Padrona ! " ) " I am a mother , with a mother 's heart . Forgive my emotion ! ? Captain Rui , have you ever known anything scandalous or improper happening in my hotel ? " ( " No , Padrona ! " ) " A defenseless old woman with God 's help I have run a respectable house . " Another long pause as she pressed her scarf to her eyes . " But yesterday a shocking and a shameful thing took place . I thought that that man  --  Don Velanton Brist6 ? was my friend . I thought he was an honorable man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can prove to you ? " " He entered the room of one of my guests and STOLE an  | object of great value ! I can scarcely speak . . . for shame. ? Who is this man , Captain Rui ? " " Padrona ... Don Jaime Tolan . " " Yes . Who without reward  --  without one cent from me ? has worked from sunrise to sunset for the love of the people of Manantiales . He has made the hospital fit for a king  --  the hospital where your dear mother is this very minute , Pancho . " " I know it , Padrona . " " Do you know what Mother Laurencia called Don Jaime Tolan ? With her own sainted lips she called him an angel . " Wellington Bristow slid to his knees . " Mrs. Wickersham . That 's ASHLEY  --  the murderer . I can prove it . " " Captain Rui , that man on the floor , that SERPENT , from his black , black heart accused that ANGEL of crimes too horrible to mention. ? Remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LIAR and THIEF , and may God be merciful to him . " It was done . " Mrs. Wickersham , have some pity on me . I 'll give you half the cauliflower . " " Captain Rui , when you are taking him to jail , do not hurt him . Behave to him in a Christian way . But do not talk to him . Do n't let him talk to anyone . I will call on the Mayor this morning and tell him of this treachery . Put Don Velanton in the ' coffee bin . ' The first three days a little soup and bread at noon . Do not treat him unkindly , but make certain that he talks to no one  --  not even to you and your guards . It is too late to weep , Mr. Bristow ! ? Don Jaime , you do not look well . " Ashley could not speak . He pointed to his throat . He unbuttoned his collar . " Open your mouth , Don Jaime ! " Mrs. Wickersham looked into his mouth , gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the saints in heaven defend us ! " She whispered two words to Captain Rui , who blanched and crossed himself . She called into the hall ? " Tomas ! Run at once to Dr.  | Martinez ! Tell him to come here ! ? Get up off the ground , Mr. Bristow . You will have time to go down on your knees in the ' coffee bin ' ! " Ashley was borne through the streets and left in the shed for desperate cases . At noon all was over . The chapel bell tolled ; the blind girls asked to be led in prayer ; the sisters could scarcely find their way among the beds . At noon Mrs. Wickersham visited the shed . He must have some " papers " for his new life . She brought a collection of old and new birth certificates , citizenship papers , and passports . They had been assembled from undertakers ' offices , from innkeepers , and even from pawnbrokers . They described men of all ages , and sorts  --  men with twelve teeth missing , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hernias and hemorrhoids and cloven palates . She brought also some penknives , bottles of ink and of acid . Ashley was in his element . They experimented with various forms of erasure , alteration , and clerical penmanship . Finally , they produced a certificate  --  stained by weather and perspiration , barely legible  --  for " Carlos Cespedes Rojas , born in Santiago de Chile , on March 7 or 9 , 1862 , blue eyes , brown hair , medium height , sound teeth , bearing a scar on his right jaw , bachelor , field worker . " At midnight she returned with an old man Esteban and five mules . His journey was to Tiburones . The road was over two hundred miles  --  one hundred and twenty , as the bird flies , if a bird had ever flown it . Few drops of rain fell on it in a century . It crossed old nitrate beds that had been abandoned since the railroad was built . It was said to be haunted by the ghosts of the many fugitives who had died there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' nests ; hay was piled on their backs . There was bread , fruit , and wine for the men . Esteban held a second wide-brimmed hat like his own . " Well , get along with you , " she said . Ashley stood looking in silence at the grey eyes in the red  | face , printing her features on his memory . She brought a silk scarf out of her handbag . " This is wet . Tie it about your forehead . " He gave her an envelope . " Put that in the jar for the Roentgen-ray machine . " Silence . " I 'll let Mr. Bristow out for a few hours . He enjoys funerals so. ? Mr. Tolland , did you ever hear of the English poet John Keats ? " " I 've heard of him . " " He said that life is a ' vale of soul-making . ' He might have added that it 's a ' vale of soul-unmaking , ' too . We go up or we go down  --  forward or back . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A few stones for a little Atenas . Write me . I 'll write you and tell you how we 're getting on. ? Start off , Esteban ! " Ashley took her right hand and kissed the back of it slowly . The leave-takings of the children of faith are like first recognitions . Time does not present itself to them as an infinite succession of endings . Twelve days later Esteban returned to Manantiales by the new road . He brought Mrs. Wickersham a letter from Carlos Cespedes . The hay and water for the mules had been barely sufficient . Several weeks later she received another by slow coastal mail . He was leaving Tiburones the next day for the north . She received no more . He was drowned at sea . No announcement of the capture of John Ashley of Coaltown ever appeared or of his death and burial . Wellington Bristow was able to persuade the consular agent that there was something suspicious ? " very fishy " ? about Mrs. Wickersham 's claims to have buried the notorious fugitive . Mr. Bristow continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | on great occasions and on grave issues , yet never for longer than thirty minutes . The First World War was imminent . His views often ran counter to those of his readers and listeners . The facades of his newspaper offices were occasionally defaced and the windows broken ; he was burned in effigy here and there ; but  --  unlike his sister Constance  --  he was seldom insulted and reviled by members of his audience . He was old-fashioned , countrified , a little ridiculous , and compelling . Roger Ashley was seventeen and a half when  --  on foot  --  he entered Chicago . He was hungry , tired , dirty , unsmiling , and resolute . He looked very much a rustic and was taken to be sixteen , but he did not know this . His blue suit , which he had outgrown , shone here and there , like a mirror . Under his arm he carried a few articles of clothing wrapped in brown paper . Like his father before him he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led all his classes and captained all his teams . He had never known fear or self-consciousness . He had leapt at runaway horses , parted fighting dogs , and rushed into burning houses as though he had been singled out to do so . He had worked all summer on Mr. Bell 's farm since he was eleven and was strong . Chicago was growing fast . It was not hard to find work , poorly paid though it was . He was free to choose and he changed jobs often . First he had to eat . Lodging was of less importance . In summer a man can sleep in parks and under bridges . Next , he had to earn money to send his mother . Above all he had to select his lifework . Sometimes he went for days with little to eat ; sometimes he deliberately took less remunerative jobs , though it reduced the sums he sent to Coaltown ; but he never ceased to search for his life 's career  --  to explore , observe , weigh , and eliminate the professions . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice and he wanted to start preparing himself as soon as possible . Two other important tasks lay before him , but he was not  | aware of them . He must acquire an education . He must reconcile himself to the human community . He thought that education , with a little application , came of itself . He thought that the dark resentment that filled his mind and heart was the normal armor of a man who has emerged from the thoughtlessness of boyhood . Many years later Dr. Gillies said : " Roger Ashley entered Chicago stump-ignorant . Fifteen years later , without having put foot in a classroom , he was the best-educated man in the country . Of course , he had some advantages over the rest of us . Socially , he was a pariah . Philosophically , he had just suffered the spectacle of his family being chewed up fine by a civilized Christian community . Economically , he owned nothing  --  he did n't even have an extra pair of shoes to pawn . Academically , he had never faced a professor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gillies failed to note . Roger possessed little sense of humor . There was no second Roger lodged within his head . A sense of humor judges one 's actions and the actions of others from a wider reference and a longer view and finds them incongruous . It dampens enthusiasm ; it mocks hope ; it pardons shortcomings ; it consoles failure . It recommends moderation . This wider reference and longer view are not the gifts of any extraordinary wisdom ; they are merely the condensed opinion of a given community at a given moment . Roger was a very serious young man . Further advantages and disadvantages will come to our attention in the course of this history . Since he entered the city hungry he immediately sought work in restaurants . He began earning his living at the bottom of the ladder of all employment ; he washed dishes . There is something comical about low tasks being performed not only adequately but to perfection . Roger knew no better , having no sense of humor . The Ashleys gave all of themselves to whatever task was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , industrious without being aggressive , and , like his father , he was inventive . He grad-  | ually instituted procedures that made for speed , efficiency , and economy . The first thing he did was to place wooden boxes in the washing troughs . All the dishwashers were getting bent backs , stiff necks , chest pains , and murderous rages from leaning over ten hours a day . He was remarked . He was called into the kitchen to supervise the mechanics of delivering and removing plates . The restaurant , like Chicago , had grown too fast . In no time he was all over the place . His name was constantly in the air , " Trent , Trent ! Wo ist der ver fluchte Kerl ? " " Trent ! How can I work if there 's no goddamned fish here ? " He was blamed for everything that went wrong , but he had a calming effect on the irritability of cooks and waiters . They cursed him during those terrible hours from noon to three and from six to nine , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate . Emergencies arose and his work carried him into the dining rooms . He reorganized service tables and sideboards . His wages were raised once , but raises are not readily given to the silent and the undemanding . He left the restaurant at the end of three months . " Resigned " is too grand a word for those who receive seventy cents a day . Feeding the public had become distasteful to him . He felt there was something infantile about it . Besides , he was looking about for a night job that would give him an opportunity to explore Chicago by day . It would also , after a short rest , enable him to get work by day as well . " The Elms " needed money and he needed a new pair of pants . Sleep is for sloths . His fellow workers at the restaurant were aghast and even wept , but he left without regret . Everybody liked him and he liked no one . He applied for the position of night clerk in a hotel . He was turned away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rusticity . Finally , he was given the night shift at the Carr-Bingham . He earned less money , but he was allowed to sleep in the trunk room under the eaves . He made himself tea at sunrise . He ate once a day , standing up . In any one of a dozen German saloons in the neighborhood he could help himself , for  | the price of a beer , to the mounds of pumpernickel , cold cuts , cheese , and pickles . The Carr-Bingham was a fourth-rate hotel . In sixth-rate hotels all is misery and vice ; in a fourth-rate one there is a grain of effort and a wisp of hope . Those who are silent , self-effacing , and attentive become the recipients of confidences . He heard many life stories between ten at night and eight in the morning . From every side there was brought home to him a thing that had never come to his attention , except in the matter of Goshen : the importance of money to self-respect and , above all , to independence . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letter from Sophia telling of the boardinghouse at " The Elms , " about Mrs. Guilfoyle , Brother Jorgenson , and the high school teacher . He promptly went out and found a daytime job . Almost nightly one or other of the guests tried to borrow money from him . " Just fifty cents , Trent  --  that 's a good fellow , " " I 'll pay you back tomorrow , honestly I will . " He was no lender ; he knew no greater need than his own . He appropriated a pair of shoes from the belongings of an absconding guest . He was often called upon to put drunkards to bed . On two occasions he pocketed the dollar bill or loose change that these late revelers dropped behind them on the stairs . Money , he felt , was for those who needed it . It 's a spiritless son and breadwinner who does not write his own morality . He reflected further on the matter , however , when two of his three shirts , then some money , were stolen from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would not become a hotel man . He had known a home . Night after night he was aware of the guests  --  the querulous breathing , the abrupt awakenings , the unrestorative sleep of the homeless . Dr. Gillies 's letter of recommendation was useful . He sold haberdashery all day , standing behind a narrow counter . He left the position after three weeks in order to catch up with sleep . When he announced his departure he was offered a promotion which he did not accept . He sorted cheques all day , seated at a  | table in a bank . He became a messenger in a law firm , an interoffice runner  --  the job was called that of " Indian . " He extended and even created his own usefulness . Everywhere he observed , weighed , explored , and eliminated the professions . He watched the chiefs  --  their hands and eyes , their relations with their subordinates , their greetings on arrival and departure . Roger had never attended a theatre , but he had played King Herod and Ahasuerus in Sunday-school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting is not to be natural . Apparently the more important a businessman became the more he " acted . " These men did not greet their associates in the morning ; they " acted " greeting their associates in the morning . Their very smiles and frowns and clearings of the throat were calculated to convey that they were important , busy , and short of temper . It was apparent that they were somehow afraid  --  afraid of a non-acted word or gesture . Moreover , Roger became aware of the deformation induced by the sedentary life  --  the revolt of the body against the long day in the swivel chair , the sagging cheek , the paunch , the increasing fatigue in the afternoon , the strained breathing , the mounting irritation , the soda tablets , and the spittoon . Roger seldom thought of his father , but his father was serving him as the measure of a man . He had never known him to be for one moment guilty of acting . These merchants and bankers and lawyers , he asked himself , did they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did they " act " being husbands and fathers ? Of course , they did . He 'd seen that often in Coaltown ? Joel Miller 's father and George Lansing 's father , the great and late Breckenridge Lansing . John Ashley had begun the day singing loudly before his shaving mirror . He raised a joyful storm in the house . " Bathroom 's free , little doggies ! Last one to breakfast is a buffalo . " His son was certain that these men did not sing in the morning . John Ashley had driven away to his office with delight and , arrived on the hill , had divided his time between office , workshop , company store , infirmary , and the shafts . Roger  | resolved that he would never follow a career that involved sitting down all day . In addition he gathered , in some obscure way , that a large part of all this " acting " was an attempt to make the operations of business appear more difficult than they were . Diversity of experience does not in itself constitute an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does . Contact with the suffering of others does not in itself enlarge understanding . Luck must play a part . Roger was overwhelmed by the crowds of Chicago . He was oppressed by the multiplicity of human beings . On the way to work he would stop and gaze at the throngs on LaSalle Street . ( During his first days he thought he was seeing the same persons walking back and forth . ) All these men and women had souls , had " selves . " All were as important to themselves as he was to himself . In seventy years everyone he was looking at  --  and himself  --  would be dead , except a few old freaks . There 'd be a whole new million hurrying and worrying and laughing and talking . " Get out of my way . I do n't know you . I 'm busy living . " " Mr. Joch said that Peking in China was eight times as big as Chicago . Crowds make you think of death ; death makes you think of crowds . . . . Nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into life . . . Cemeteries must be awfully crowded : ' Did you enjoy your trip , son ? ' ' Was it a pleasant visit , ma'am ? ' . . . Chicago 's like a big clockshop  --  all those little hammers going . In the street people put on a face so that strangers wo n't read their souls . A crowd is a sterner judge than a relative or a friend . The crowd is God . LaSalle Street is like hell  --  you 're being judged all the time . . . . Suicide very logical . " In Old Quarry Pond there were millions of minnows . Mr. Marden said that fish ate their own eggs when there were too many . War  --  not enough food to go round . " Crowds make you think of money . Everybody has some money in his pocket . Metal and paper . Represents a certain amount  | of work and the quality of the work . Biggest lie under the sun . Mr. Joch telling me about the Pullman strike nine years ago ... . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another . On the street men 's eyes never quiet , every minute looking for a pretty girl . Women put blinkers on their faces ; look straight ahead . Pretend they do n't see anybody . Same thing . Pull of the sexes is like a carrot hanging in front of a donkey 's nose . Keeps up his interest . Like Shakespeare says , Lights fools the way to dusty death . ' .. . " Crowds make you think about religion . What did God mean by making so many ? I 'm not going to begin thinking about religion for five years . I do n't know where to begin . Probably just a carrot in front of your nose . Makes people feel important . Maybe Papa 's dead . But he 's not dead for Sophie and me . He 's alive in us even when we are n't thinking about him . " Imagination means seeing through walls . And seeing through skulls . Eugene V. Debs in prison just a mile away . I wish I could be a fly on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lots of things . " At times he felt himself shrinking to a ghost , to a nobody ? cold , meaningless , and alone . To recover himself he placed Sophia beside him . " Look , Sophie ! Just look ! " He decided to appraise a life in medicine . Without presenting Dr. Gillies 's letter he applied at a hospital for work as an orderly and was engaged at once . The pay was as low as the dishwasher 's , but he was given his meals and a cot in a dormitory . He swabbed out operating rooms and carried out pails of flesh . He fainted once , as did the nurse beside him . He washed the moribund and held the aged and broken in his arms while the nurses changed the sheets under them . He had never been ill and prior to his arrival at the Carr-Bingham he had seen very little illness . The examples of it he had seen there were obviously the result of mistakes and general foolishness . It was some time before he was able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was silent ,  | willing , and tireless . The nurses came to take it for granted that he was always on duty . There is something comical , you remember , about performing a low job perfectly . This servant had no sense of proportion . In the wards after " lights out " he would return several times during the night to tend Mr. Kegan 's fistula or the unhappy Barry Hotchkiss 's strangulated hernia . His devotion to duty was mistaken for sympathy . He neglected nothing ; he forgot nothing . In previous tasks he had inspired friendship ; here his comings and goings were followed with love . He loved no one . When he hastened silently between the beds at three in the morning whispers arose  --  as on some battlefield after a hard-fought defeat ? " Trent ! Trent ! " He was much in demand as a letter writer . ( " I have only time for about twenty words , Mr. Watson . " " You already owe me for three stamps , Judge . " ) He was occasionally called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and said softly , " You are a good boy . God will reward you . " Roger wanted none of God 's recompenses . He wanted twenty dollars to send his mother . Every month that passed saw a reduction in the number of things that could surprise him . His contacts with his fellow orderlies enlarged his experience . Dr. Gillies had refrained from telling him that they were drawn from among the all but unemployable  --  men fresh from prison or absent without leave from their country 's armed forces , unfrocked priests , epileptics , pyromaniacs under surveillance , cryptographers working on Shakespeare 's plays , collectors of dolls ' clothing , weight lifters , and world reformers . The vast room was seldom quiet , for the orderlies worked in staggered shifts . Roger slept with cotton in his ears , only ostensibly because of the noise  --  he could have slept through battles and cyclones  --  but because of the conversation . The presence of woman obsessed the dormitory at all hours , resembling a cloud of gnats , invoked and repelled in cackles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The practice of stuffing his ears with cotton he adopted from  | Clem , the oldest of the orderlies . Clem spent the larger part of his free time reading ; he would have spent all of it so but for his failing eyesight . For every half hour he read he sat for a half hour with his hands covering his eyes in a pose that suggested prayer or desperation . He was a philosopher . In the limited space available to in one corner of the dormitory he had built a hermit 's cell about his bed , made from packing cases marked " Jeyes ' Fluid " and " Jarvis 's HCHO " ? walls and bookshelves . Many of the books were in Latin or in an English as impenetrable as Latin ; some were in French and German : SPINOZA . . . DESCARTES . . . PLOTINUS . Hence the cotton in his ears . Roger 's eyes often rested speculatively on Clem 's lowered sound-proof head . Most of the patients left the hospital shaken , but cured . Roger received many gifts  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suspenders , pocket combs , grocers ' calendars . ( " Goodbye , Trent boy , thanks a lot , " " Goodbye , Trent , you 've been awful good to my husband . Now do n't forget what I said : we have a room for you in our house , if ever you need it . " ) He was loved and he loved no one . But Roger had much to do with death . He had made a resolve not to put to himself the questions that inevitably arise from a frequent contact with death , but certain resolutions are hard to keep . When a patient was entering on a difficult or protracted death he was lifted onto a wheeled table and rolled into a room reserved for the dying . The orderlies had an ugly name for this room that Roger never used . Priests came in and out . Relatives were permitted to stand a moment at the door . Orderlies were in the custom of dropping in and lighting a pipe . Conversation was not easy , what with all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called for their mothers  --  even men who appeared to be nearing a hundred . ( A man 's first and last words are easy to say ; that m recurs in all languages . ) A bowl of filed-down pennies stood on a shelf . Roger came to recognize fairly well the moment  | of death . He watched with wonder . He liked the words " gave up the ghost . " ( Query : where does it go ? ) He could look steadily into the eyes of his older patients . He averted his eyes from the young men . From time to time the weight of these experiences bore heavily on him , just eighteen . He would wait until nightfall , hoping for clear weather . In clear weather he would carry an armful of blankets to the roof of the hospital , clear away the snow , and lie down with his face to the sky . From the gorge in Coaltown one saw only a narrow portion of the heavens . It gave him a restful feeling to think that God who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . There was probably some connection . They were shining down on " The Elms " and maybe on his father , millions of them . He was becoming reconciled to the disturbing discovery of the human multitude . Against his will his thoughts returned often to a puzzling rigmarole told him by one of his fellow orderlies . Peter Bogardus had been a barber , but had given up the work because he was nervous ; he could n't handle knives . He was pockmarked and totally bald . He did n't drink , but he had bad habits . He was a better orderly than most  --  far better than Roger because he knew more . ( " Quick as a fox in a crisis , " said Chief Nurse Bergstrom . " He saves twenty lives a year . " ) He belonged to an association that made a study of the life after death and ghosts . He invited Roger to attend a meeting , but Roger refused ; he was afraid he would be charged admission . Besides , he assimilated what he wanted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idling in the room for the dying . Roger often dropped in there to see how things were going . He 'd accompanied many a patient along the road . The other orderlies noticed that he had a sort of gift for quieting the patients just before they " kicked the bucket . " ( " Trent , why do you always pick up the old geezers ' hands ? " " I do n't know . Do I ? I think maybe they like it . " ) It was Bogardus 's day on duty there . He walked back and  | forth smoking long brown cigarettes . At intervals he shook off the ash into the bowl of pennies . " Trent , " he said , " all men lead as many lives as there are sands in the Ganges River . " Roger waited . Finally he had to ask , " What do you mean , Pete ? " " We are born again and again . These three men here ? look at them ! " Roger did n't have to look at what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trembling chins and cheeks . " They will be dead in a few hours . But forty-nine days from now  --  seven sevens ! ? they will be born again . And they will be born again hundreds of thousands of times . " Roger remembered hearing something about this ridiculous idea before . In Coaltown his father had put money in the collection plate at church to send missionaries across the ocean to rid ignorant people of just such notions as that . But Roger was readier than he had been to listen to old and new ideas ; Coaltown had some pretty ridiculous ones of its own . " There 's a mighty ladder , boy . In each new life a man may acquire merit that will permit him to step up a rung or two , or he may fall into error and slip back . Through the merit of Gautama Buddha himself and those who have followed him all men tend to rise . Finally , when they have lived as many lives as the sands of the Ganges , they will arrive at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words ! ? arrived at that threshold , these men will not step over it . They will deny themselves supreme happiness . They will continue to be reborn . They will choose to wait until all men have reached that threshold ? men as numerous as the sands of the Ganges  --  many of them cruel and wicked men . They move about among us now , in disguise , aiding us to ascend that mighty ladder . But even when all the men on this earth , as many as are the sands of the Ganges , have reached that threshold none of them will step over it into supreme happiness , for there are other inhabited stars , as many as  | the sands of the Ganges . We must wait until all the men on all the stars have purified themselves . No man can wish to be happy until everyone else in the universe is happy . " Roger stared at him , uncomprehendingly . His family had been happy at " The Elms . " Peter went on : " You can see that great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count all those human beings on it ? Sometimes you can see a little flutter  --  someone has mounted four steps  --  Socrates or Mrs. Besant or Tom Paine or Abraham Lincoln . Sometimes there 's a moment of confusion  --  looks like an avalanche in the Rockies  --  a man  --  a Nero or a millionaire  --  has tumbled and lost fifty or a thousand of his lives . None ever stands still . " He continued to walk to and fro smoking his long brown cigarette . Suddenly he turned and shouted , " Free yourself of attachments ! Wife and child  --  illusions ! Your reputation among men , your honor , your dignity  --  vanity ! Look at these men ! Some men , at the moment of death , are given for half a second a memory of their former existences  --  a glimpse of their future existences . Boy , they lean for half a second over the vast abyss of time and see the long wretchedness of their past lives . Others look up and see the threshold in the far distance above them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end to living in this sorrowful world , this vale of tears . " Roger started . He had seen those lightning-quick returns to consciousness  --  those expressions of immeasurable horror , those visions of all consolation . Bogardus crossed and leaned toward him , lowering his voice . " Trent , know this : there is a limit even to the number of the sands of the Ganges . We shall be Buddhas when the last earthbound man and the last starbound man has sprung free . " Peter 's agitation had communicated itself to two of the patients . " Judge " Bartlett 's eyes were rolling imploringly from side to side . Roger could read the message of his agitated fingers on the blanket ; he understood the guttural noises from his throat .  | He crossed the room and wiped the patient 's mouth with a towel . He shouted , " I ca n't write a letter now , Judge . I have n't got a pencil . I 'll do it tomorrow . Go to sleep . Yes , go to sleep . Get some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On another table a patient mutters . " Hab kei Gelt .... Mufti . ... Hil f ' .... Lu. . . . u . . . u . . . ft . " " Alles gut , Herr Metzger ! " cried Roger . " Schla f a bissi ! fa ! " Peter Bogardus continued : " You Christians ca n't wait that long  --  no , siree . You want your supreme happiness next Tuesday . You ca n't wait ten billion billion years  --  that 's Christ 's fault  --  impatience ; always announcing the end of the world , next week , next month . And Christianity inherited his impatience  --  kill , torture , burn , divide . Baptize ' em or burn ' em ! Believe in me or go to hell . That 's what hell is  --  impatience . " He wiped the perspira- i tion from his forehead . " Look at me  --  getting excited ! Look at me  --  attached to trying to make you understand something . Why should I care whether a little peanut like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the damnable impatience I acquired when I was a Christian . Look at me  --  trembling ! " He sat down on the floor , cross-legged . " I must do my breathing exercises and calm myself . No ! I 'd better stand on my head . That 's best . " Peter flung his heels to the ceiling . Roger was accustomed to this . He was still thinking about the ladder of rebirth . " You do n't really believe that , do you , Peter ? " Peter , upside down , rested his pale watery eyes on Roger and waited . " Never ask a man what he believes . Watch what he uses . ' Believe ' is a dead word and brings death with it . " A new patient , purple of face , was rolled in . " Hello , Trent . Hello , Pete , " said the orderly . " Hello , Herb . " " Y'know him ? " " Yes , " said Roger . " First name 's Nick . Night watchman in the Fletcher Building . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having served and washed him for weeks . If there was anything in the Great Ladder idea , Nick was high up , high up . Roger had never seen a patient who so made himself at home  --  so to speak  --  in the hospital and in his pain . Though dependent upon others for humiliating aid , though his bed stood among those of noisy , foul-mouthed , furious sufferers , he gazed tranquilly at the ceiling . A stag would die so . He asked for nothing . When Roger offered to write a letter for him , he dictated some words to his daughter in Boston , requesting only that the letter be mailed a week after his burial . He told her that his Mormon brothers would put his body under the ground when he was freed of it . Roger turned his chair and sat with his back to Old Nick . Nick would not wish a friend to witness his animal struggles ; they were not important . And suddenly it came to Roger that his father , too , was high , high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hyena trial " ? his father had conducted himself just so : out of reach of curiosity and malice and to all appearances at home in the courtroom and his extremity . Roger went out of the door and out of the building . He stood in the sunlight at the hospital 's rear entrance , shivering in his white suit . He had no questions to put to his father . He had no wish to sit down at a table and talk with him ; but Roger would have given much of the little he possessed to see him pass along the street . He would have followed him for blocks simply to rest his eyes on someone who was so high up . He wanted to watch him closely too , because someday he ? Roger  --  would have children of his own . He would leave them behind him . He would die . He was being drawn to the human community by thoughts of the dying , the banished , and the unborn . It was from another aspect of his family 's slowness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of  | a woman in the distance would evoke his mother ; an object , a girl 's voice , a smell would recall " The Elms . " Everything would go dark before his eyes . He would be obliged to put out his hand to a lamp-post or a wall and to wait until the pain subsided . From time to time , in order to suffer more intensely  --  that is to embrace " The Elms " more passionately  --  he went to the railway station from which trains departed for Coaltown . The station was near the lake . He had never seen a body of standing water larger than a pond . The view of those innumerable waves calmed him . " When you think of all the people in the world and all the thousands of years that have gone by , I bet there must have been a lot of fellows my age who had to leave their homes for one reason or another ? like going to war , for instance . " Questions , the torment of questions . There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deprivation awaken the young mind to inquiry . Roger did not realize that he and his sisters had acquired that habit of mind in their earliest years : they had struggled to survive . Like plants in a parched soil , they had sent down deep roots . From infancy they had groped hither and thither , asking " What ? " and " why ? " and " how ? " Beata Ashley was an admirable mother ; she gave her children much ; she gave them everything except the essential . As we have seen ( and as a result of a starvation in her own childhood ) she must love only one human being . John Ashley could give his children the essential  --  and much besides  --  but he was late-maturing ; the flowering of his imagination was still to come . The children did not turn in on themselves . They were saved from fruitless introspection by their father 's joy in them . Lily became the princess sleeping in the cave ; Sophia entered into her ministry to animals . Constance  --  knowing no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would see herself as the mother of millions , more than half of them older than herself . Roger barely escaped some obscure  | shipwreck . A puzzling event took place in the summer of 1891 . He was six and a half . He was well known in Coaltown as a model boy  --  so bright , so well behaved . His parents were out of the house . Seizing his youngest sister 's chair he broke five windows in the living room . He then ran away from home , weeping as from some unfathomable abandonment . He stopped only to pick up Sophia 's kitten to comfort him on his long walk to China . His parents tendered scarcely one word of rebuke . Roger never gave vent to his frustration again . A change came over him . The small adventurer and babbler became taciturn . He became a listener ( " what ? " " why ? " ) . The expression on his face varied little . He became the school 's best student and athlete . He was liked by everyone in town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Porky . He accepted one person 's love , Sophia 's . He was strengthened by confidence in his father and isolated by his passionate love for his mother . Questions . Questions . Now  --  like his father , thousands of miles away  --  he had no vocabulary and no grammar for reflection . What unity could be found in the increasing diversity of his existence : the catastrophe in Coaltown ; his mother walking beside him imperturbedly to the courthouse ; the mystery of his father 's rescue ; the noontime crowd on LaSalle Street ; the deaths he was witnessing daily ; God 's responsibility for the suffering of children , horses , dogs , and cats ; Eugene V. Debs in prison scarcely a mile away ; his happiness when he looked at the waves and the stars ; his fellow orderlies ' views on women ; his resolve to achieve a great lifework ? And the working world  --  injustice everywhere : employers cheated the workers ; workers cheated the employers and one another ? He 'd done some cheating himself . One day he stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books you 're reading  --  do students study them in college ? " " Yes , some of them . " " Did you go to college ? "  | " Yes , I did . " " What does a college education do for you ? " " It ties together the things you see . " Roger drew back as though he had been struck . " Can a person educate himself , Clem ? " " One in a million , maybe . " " Does most of an education come out of books ? " " A man who tried to understand anything without knowing THOSE BOOKS would just be a feathered kangaroo . Like Pete Bogardus . You 're wasting my time . " " Thank you , Clem . " He had no wish to go to any of those colleges , or  --  for a time , at least  --  to read any of those famous books . He had walked the streets of Chicago at all hours . He had listened to scores of life stories . Man is cruel to man and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhuman to others . It 's not kindness that 's important but justice . Kindness is the stammering apology of the unjust . The whole world 's wrong , he saw . There 's something wrong at the heart of the world and he would track it down . Many of those books and colleges had been around for hundreds of years  --  with very little effect . The few serious books he had looked into seemed windy , slow-moving , filled with padding  --  like political addresses and sermons . Like all Ashleys , he wanted no help . We shall see later how his father " invented " marriage and paternity . Roger wanted to invent the explanation for existence and the rules whereby men could live rationally side by side  --  to be the first philosopher , the first planner of the just community . Independence of mind ( most men boast of possessing it ) can not rest . Roger had already entered on this great task . His head was full of notions and he was driven to write them down . At the Carr-Bingham Hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and later at the hospital , he wrote thousands and thousands of words on the backs of old account books , bills , announcements , and calendars  --  notions . He  | had never had a friend of his own age , except Porky , even more taciturn than himself . He had never , like other young men , built and unbuilt God , society , morals in conversation . He now drew up an explanation of the nature of things ; he derived ethics from the order in the cosmos ; he designed the constitution of an ideal state . One day his feverish resort to writing came to an end as abruptly as it had begun . He carried the armfuls of scrap paper to the incinerator . He had come to a dead end , not in discouragement but as the result of an insight : he discovered that he knew nothing and that he was ill equipped to learn , but that learning was possible . He was ripe for reading . We shall see how he entered reading by the back door . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hotel , promoted to day clerk . He was anxious to make more money and he had arrived at a conclusion about medicine . He had become aware of that never-ending line  --  from the beginning of time to the end of time  --  of patients waiting at the door . No bed was empty for longer than three hours . To his eyes medicine appeared to be a business of patch and shore and bolster  --  the temporary repair of unsalvageable vessels . He was an ignorant country boy ; he had no idea that medicine could take a different view of itself . Back at the hotel Roger came into closer contact with a group of newspaper reporters who shared a row of cubicle-like rooms on the top floor near his own . This corridor had long since 16st its institutional uniformity . Most of the doors had been shattered in rage or horseplay and removed . The management had prudently replaced the chairs with benches and packing cases . For men without women a cave is sufficient . A smell of gin , lemon peel , mash , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom ate , slept , washed , or fell silent . They were ill paid and only intermittently ambitious , but they were convinced that they belonged to the greatest profession in  | the world . They knew everything ; all men except themselves were the dupes of appearances . They were privy to corruption in public office , the farce of philanthropy , the hypocrisy of the clergy , the wolves ' raids of big business  --  especially of the railroads and of the stockyards . They were rich in all the knowledge they were not permitted to print . Knowledge , like courage and virtue , isolates a man ; they were thrown back on one another 's company . Barred from publishing what they knew , they were driven to seek out some other mode of expression : they were conversationalists . Conversation was their brightly lighted stage and their battlefield . There they knew their triumphs and their massacres . Day by day and night by night they strove for the palm of the unparalleled jest , the supreme verbal acrobacy . Under the guise of comradeship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words and images of intoxicating precision ; they demanded ever stronger accents from blasphemy and obscenity . They were untalented reporters because their ambitions lay elsewhere ; they were conversationalists . Roger listened . They were quick-witted ; they had a wide if heterogeneous field of information . Above all they had a point of view : the abject condition of man and the futility of his efforts to improve himself . Any confrontation with fortitude , heroism , piety , or even dignity rendered them uncomfortable . They prided themselves on being impressed by nothing . Any impulse toward admiration or compassion they promptly converted into ribaldry and persiflage . Several of these reporters had been present at the Coaltown trial and recognized the hotel clerk . They handled him roughly about it for a while , then forgot it . They could not take him seriously . He was a country yokel , a rube . He was still wet behind the ears . Roger had two qualities , however , that recommended him to them . He was an attentive though unsmiling listener and he was reliable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trent listens with his eyes and ears and nose  --  damn it , he listens with his chin . " Dissipated men need one trustworthy friend . He became  | their banker and their message center . " Keep this money for me until tomorrow , Trent . I do n't know what will be happening to me tonight . " " Tell Herb to keep out of sight . Gretchen 's looking for him . " " Tell Spider the caucus is at ten o'clock in St. Stephen 's Hall . " If journalism was the greatest profession in the world Roger resolved to look into it . He could not understand why reporters held all action and all human beings , except themselves , in contempt . He could not understand why , seeing corruption everywhere , they were not moved to report the whole of it . One afternoon Spider , returning to the hotel , laid a large envelope before Roger . It contained scores of stories and editorials about the Ashley-Lansing case . During the trial the Ashleys read no papers . He now read these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurately they reported the proceedings in the courthouse and yet how feeble and unfocused the editorial comment was , even when it inveighed against the verdict and the conduct of the trial . During a solemn midnight walk beside Lake Michigan Roger resolved to become a newspaperman . Years later Roger was able to acknowledge the extent of his indebtedness to the group of reporters on the top floor of the Carr-Bingham : his introduction to journalism , to opera , to one of those devil 's advocates that are so important in any education ? that is , to the conversation of T. G. Speidel  --  and to reading . The reporters were readers , as time permitted . There were many books to be found on the top floor of the Carr-Bingham Hotel  --  under the beds , over the wardrobes , in the toilet and broom cupboard , beside the mousetrap . Most of them were pocket size  --  a child 's pocket size . Their covers were of spongy blue paper or of imitation leather . They bore such titles as The Wit and Wisdom of Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Best Pages of Casanova , Nietzsche on Superstition , Tolstoy on Art , Nuggets from Goethe , Nuggets from Voltaire , Confucius on The Center . Roger read them . He entered reading by the back  | door . He paid a visit to the Public Library , but was displeased with it . He began to haunt second-hand bookstores . Reading became for him a great adventure . He told no one of his rewards and of his defeats . Even before he arrived at his decision to become a journalist Roger learned that the profession enjoys an inestimable privilege : newspapermen can occasionally obtain free admission to the theatre . One evening a reporter gave him a ticket to the opera . He attended a performance of Fidelio . It was an overwhelming experience . He had endured much . He was at no time near to any breaking point , but he was starved of food for the spirit . It was time that he gazed on larger images of perseverance and constancy . A man can produce fortitude from his own vitals , but the true food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into battle they listened  --  eyes fixed on the distance  --  to songs that recalled the exploits of their ancestors . It was perhaps not incidental that on that occasion he followed the story of a woman who descended into a dungeon to rescue a husband unjustly condemned to death . A week later another opera offered him the spectacle of a young man who endured trials of fire and water to win the hand of the girl he loved . At the end of it the young man was received into the fellowship of the wise and the just . If operas were like that ? if they concerned themselves with things that really mattered ( rendered all but unendurably convincing by such wonderful noise ) ? he must so arrange his life as to be constantly present at them . He persuaded his friends on the top floor of the hotel to find work for him on a newspaper . He became a " printer 's devil , " or " pie monkey , " as the job was called there . His hands and face and apron were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presses . In a maze of iron staircases he rushed copy from the reporters to the editors . He rushed copy from the editors to the  | typesetters . He soon learned what was needed before it was called for ; he foresaw blockages ; he eased the recurring crises . The halls resounded with his name . " Trent ! Trent ! Where 's that damned Trent ? " " Trent , carry this poop downstairs and be quick about it . " A reporter , short of time between two stories , would thrust his notes on Roger : " Run it up ! And remember WHAT , WHO , WHERE , WHEN . " He was awaiting his opportunity and his opportunity came . All the reporters were out on assignment . It was learned that a man had strangled a woman behind Heffernan 's Livery Stable . " Get that story and get it right ! Run ! " Another opportunity arose and another . In late August , 1903 , he became a reporter . He had been in Chicago thirteen months . He was eighteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only doing his duty and feeding his curiosity , he was making a thing . His youthful and countrified air enabled him to be present at occasions from which an older and more knowing man would have been thrown out . He stood against the wall at closed political meetings ; he slipped past the guards in the training quarters of boxing champions ; he re-entered his old hospital by the employees ' entrance and obtained a confession from a dying man . He arrived before the police and put questions to women who did not yet know that they were widows . He was taking notes at a Greek patriotic banquet in the Olympia Restaurant while the guests , stricken with food poisoning , lay about on the floor like brightly colored clothes bags . By December , 1903 , he was writing his sister , " I bet I know four hundred Chicagoans by names and faces . " Soon he was submitting special articles to the editor ; they were known as " pudding pieces . " They were signed TRENT : " Chicagoans , Save Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Swop Market on Wisconsin Avenue , " " Know Your Chinese Neighbors . " He sent them to Sophia . Notices would appear on the assignment board : " TF ? 500 words  --  Friday ? Women 's interests . " The editor was bewildered by Roger 's contributions and rejected half of them as unlikely to interest readers ,  | or as capable of giving offense . When a new editor joined the paper , Roger resubmitted them . He was inventing a new kind of journalism . Readers began to keep scrapbooks of these pieces ; the offices of the newspaper were plagued with requests for old issues . He received a bonus of twenty-five cents for each . Here are some further titles . Sympathy was stirring ; he was beginning to see through walls and through skulls . " A Day at Hull House . " " A Child Goes to the Stockyards " ( twice rejected ) . " A Fourth-rate Hotel . " " The Statues in Our Parks . " " Thanks , Bettina ! " ( " Trent " interviewed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The concluding sentence read : " By the time these words have been set in print Bettina 's hoofs will have been bottled for glue . " ) " Seagoing Adventure . " ( The night boat to Milwaukee . ) " Know Your Hungarian Neighbors . " ( The " Ungaria Eterna Association " promptly sent him an invitation to a banquet in his honor which he courteously declined . ) " Kennels for Babies . " ( Twice rejected . Shocked readers canceled their subscriptions . ) " Pat Quiggan and Il Trovatore . " ( A scene shifter at the auditorium gives his account of what takes place in the famous opera . Roger had little sense of humor , but an unerring ear . Truth is funnier than fiction . Like a number of the other puddings this was reprinted from coast to coast , much embellished . ) " A Pleasant Evening to You , Gentlemen . " ( A visit to the newly opened " St. Casimir 's Home for the Aged . " Roger received a letter of appreciation from the Archbishop . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a seamstresses ' sweatshop . A score of readers sent the author the text of a poem he had never read , " The Song of the Shirt . " ) " Who Are Chicago 's Seven Best Preachers ? " ( Three articles . Roger had unwittingly put his head into a hornets ' nest of sec-  | tarian enthusiasm and strife . For weeks he received from fifty to a hundred letters a day . ) " A Cap for Florence Nightingale . " ( October , 1905 . This was written in great trouble of mind to give pleasure to Sophia . Roger had just heard from Porky that she had been taken to the Bell Farm for rest . He wrote her every day , finally enclosing this " pudding " and announcing that he was returning to Coaltown for Christmas . The editor first refused this piece as too silly for print , whereupon Roger resigned , declaring that he would take his work to another paper . The editor relented . In it Trent reproduced the thoughts of a father as he watched his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' training school in Chicago . The girl was named Sophia and had lived in a house in southern Illinois called " The Elms . " The father recalled his daughter 's love for animals , the splints she had made for squirrels and birds , the fledglings she had fed from an eye dropper . The author seemed to know a great deal about the duties , the trials , and the rewards of nursing . The piece was widely reprinted and brought many letters . A big cake was delivered to the newspaper office ; it had been baked by the sister at Misericordia Hospital who , they said , had long been praying for him . ) Roger had a rickety ink-stained table in the City Room , but was seldom there . There was a rumor in the city that he was the son of a famous criminal ; it was attributed to envious gossip . Rumor also said that he was under twenty , which was preposterous . It was generally believed that he came of an old Chicago family and was well on in life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evanston , surrounded by a large family and many animals . Roger had a considerable acquaintance , however , among people who " worked , " to whom he was known as " that boy who writes those things in the paper . " He had made a number of enemies also , particularly in the sporting and political circles , and had had occasion to defend himself from violence . All this activity , to him , bore little resemblance to the lifework in journalism that  | was forming in his mind . He was looking forward to inventing a journalism that had never been seen before . He was not impatient . He did not take these " puddings " seriously . Besides , their spelling and grammar were deplorable . He took the precaution of submitting them to old Mr. Brant of the green eyeshade , who prepared them for print . Roger studied and digested Mr. Brant 's emendations . In Chicago " Trent " was beginning to be famous , but those who have never wished for fame in early youth are slow to recognize it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . As far as he was concerned he wrote solely for money . During the spring of 1904 his face narrowed , his voice descended half an octave , his glance sharpened . His inner weather became less troubled . Perhaps he learned laughter from Demetria , Lauradel , and Izumi  --  of whom we shall hear more ; perhaps it sprang from his pleasure in his work . His characteristic movements were swift ; he crossed and recrossed the city as though he had wings on his heels . At Christmas he sent his mother a sheaf of his " puddings " and gave for the first time an address to which she could reply . He made no apology for having withheld it so long ? ostensibly to escape annoyance from the police  --  and she made no allusion to it : at any distance this mother and son could read each other 's thoughts . She expressed her pleasure in his articles . She thanked him for his remittances and assured him that they were no longer necessary . She gave him an account of the boardinghouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him that Lily had left Coaltown to study singing in Chicago . Lily sent her money regularly , but she did not know what name she had taken nor any address for her . ( The Ashleys were odd folk . ) She hoped that Roger would visit them in Coaltown before long . His room had been rented to many guests , but it would be readied for him . She made no mention of the ordeals they had undergone together two and a half years ago . She concluded her letter in German : she asked for a photograph of him . Both had written many drafts for these Christmas letters ; the emotion had been consigned to the wastepaper baskets .  | The reporters spent a large part of their days and nights in Krauss 's , a German saloon on Wells Street , equidistant from their several newspapers ' offices . There they wrote their stories and carried on their week-long , month-long card games , and there they wrestled for the conversational crown . Roger needed their conversation , though he soon outgrew it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vocabulary was rich . The talk turned largely on liquor ( after-effects of last night 's consumption ) , women ( rapacity of , their staggering over-self-estimation , Schopenhauer 's matchless essay on ) , politics ( gorgonzola in the City Hall , populace led by the nose ) , their editors ( exposure and downfall predicted ) , literature ( Omar Khayyam , greatest poet that ever lived ) , philosophy ( Colonel Robert G. Ingersoll , towering intellect of ) , Chicago 's rich men ( hands and feet in the trough ) , religion ( farcical character of , opiate of the masses ) , venereal disease ( wonder doctor reported in Gary , Indiana ) . Roger endured much browbeating . For a time they were able to ignore his rapid advancement . His youthfulness , ignorance , illiteracy , and countrified air rendered it incredible . It was assumed that some mysterious person , or persons , wrote the pieces for him . By June of 1904 , however , there could no longer be any doubt . Their condescension turned to violent dislike . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a retraction . He was no longer welcome at Krauss 's . Before that privilege was denied him , however , he had made a friend and taken a profit . The dean and Nestor of the round tables , Thomas Garrison Speidel , " T.G. , " had adopted him as audience , pupil , and doormat . T.G. was a nihilist . For a time he had belonged to both anarchist and nihilist clubs and had addressed them  --  first to their admiration , then to their mounting bewilderment and fury . He was duly thrown out of both organizations . On the one hand he was eloquent on the necessity of razing all political and social institutions , but on the other he insinuated many a sneer at the enthusiasms of the revolutionary dream . His pre-eminence among the reporters reposed upon the purity with which he hated " every-  | thing " and upon the fact that he seldom spoke . He was a dean at forty-five and a mastiff among puppies . He had a fine head , lined and furrowed , and freckled with light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of circus performers , who had found him , at the age of five , unadapted to acrobatic training . He had been farmed out to foster homes , flogged , scalded , locked up in cupboards , and always starved . There had been a history of running away , of stealing for hoboes ' dens , of reformatories , of being adopted by kindly and unkindly farmers , of more escapes . He had earned his living in many ways . He had followed county fairs and been a mesmerist in a side show . He had even dabbled in quack healing . In a camp meeting in Kentucky he had effected three cures so remarkable that a sacred rage descended on the congregations ; he barely escaped their enthusiasm with his life . He never ventured into healing again . Finally he came to rest as a reporter : the occupation was not sedentary ; it admitted of drinking at all hours ; its demands on sustained thought were intermittent ; it flattered a delusion of omniscience . He had been married four or three times . Occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door of the newspaper office or at Krauss 's . They were well-behaved and bright  --  all T.G. 's wives had been , as his daughters proved to be , exceptional women . There is a limit to the number of ten-cent pieces a drinking man can dispense on a salary of twelve dollars a week . He talked to them with gravity and great charm . ( He reserved his contempt for persons whom he knew well . ) The children went away pleased ; they had merely wanted to look at their father . T.G. had a tormenting secret . He was the author of some verse dramas . Throughout that stormy childhood and youth he had read books . Unfortunately , he did not so much read books as read himself into books . He was incapable of a prolonged self-forgetfulness . He had never been able to finish Rousseau 's Confessions or even Anna Karenina  --  so great was the turbulence set up within him . Similarly , he was a victim of music . A band  | concert unmanned him . Even as a boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was singing or playing . He even slipped into churches . He made no distinction between good music and bad , but inferior music had a more rapid action . His dramas were called Abelard and Lancelot and , of course , Lucifer . He had never finished a play and never read a line to a human being . The friendship between T.G. and Roger resembled an armed truce . Each needed the other . T.G. needed a fresh ear for his doctrines and a companion in total disillusion . He proselytized . Roger needed the older man 's conversation : it brought to the surface , it aerated , his half-formed misanthropy . In the early days of their association , T.G. 's picture of society as a facade concealing beast , sloth , peacock , blindworm , and asp glided into Roger 's mind like balm . If Roger had much to learn , he had much to unlearn . The two men were also useful to each other in a practical sense . They worked on different papers . After attending separately some trial , boxing match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the occasion to the other . If T.G. had been drinking , Roger wrote two accounts of the event and gave one of them to his friend . It was neither the scabrous nor iconoclastic content of T.G. 's conversation that introduced a constant strain on their relationship ; it was the burden of insult and contempt that Roger was called upon to endure . " T.G. " could be rendered frantic by any reply that invoked moral values or a shade of idealism . " You dreck ! You donkey drool ! You yellow drawers ! You have no ideas ! All you 've got in your head are some clinkers from Coaltown and your grandmother 's old trusses ! " At this , Roger would rise , gaze at him a moment , kick over a chair , and start for the door . T.G. would call him back , tender a sour apology , and the truce would be resumed . It was not easy to humiliate or insult the Ashleys . Their attention would be riveted , not on themselves , but on their attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Early in her career Lily was often hissed or booed in the opera houses of Europe ; she waited tranquilly through the tumult for the opinion of the majority to manifest itself and to make clear to herself , after the performance , the reasons for the antagonism . Many hotels and very many homes refused to receive Constance . She said , " After people have had the pleasure of being shocked they start to think . My best supporters began as my worst enemies . But why must that be ? " One of the reasons for Roger 's patience now was his search for an answer to that question : why does each of us do what we do  --  the petty , the favored , the aggressive , the meek ? Always there lurked the fear that one 's own view of truth was merely a small window in a small house . In the face of so important a concern any contempt poured on oneself was incidental . June , 1904 : " You know why your father was such a grinning idiot , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farce , do n't you ? Because Coaltown and everybody in it was stupefied by the fumes that came up from under the ground . You know that the miners in Coaltown are the worst paid in the country ? " " No .

" " Do n't lie to me ! Where was he  --  asleep ? The facts speak for themselves . There were very few miners with less than five children . A miner with a small family could move away and find a better job . And did . Men with seven children are stuck . Especially when they 're hipdeep in debt to the company stores .

Joe started coughing . ' Sorry , Joe , we ca n't use you any more ; you 're dying . ' And Dohenus : sixty-three men caught in a gas caloup . Fifty-one widows . Almost three hundred little orphans .

He was on the leash from rich men . You come from the middle class , do n't you ? That is to say : the crawling class ? You do n't know how to use the words ' rich ' and ' poor . ' There were six in your family . You all had two pairs of shoes , did n't you ? " " Yes . " " You had meat every day of the week , did n't you ? You had meat twice a day . Blistering cabooses !

" " What do you mean , T.G. ? " " You went to the circus last week , did n't you ? Well , go again . Ask the guards to let you go into the lions ' cage at feeding time . Now , when the lion 's got that hunk of horsemeat between his teeth , you take it away from him . You can do it . Yes , you can . You can do it , but you have to KILL him first . That 's the picture of the rich man and his property . Get this straight . No rich man ever gave away a penny he could find a use for . Never has and never will . By separating themselves from a little money the rich feel justified in making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their bowels to catch those half-dozen flies they need to feed themselves and their loved ones ; but the rich make silk and silk and silk . Nothing can stop them . Their houses are stuffed with it . Their banks are stuffed with it , and it 's not out of their bowels they make it , but out of the bowels and lungs and eyeballs of others . The little coins that fall from their tables make churches and libraries , do n't they ? Churches ! That 's where the soothing syrup 's stored . There 's no marriage tighter than that between the banker and the bishop . The poor should rest content in that situation in which God has seen fit to place them . It 's God 's will that they work a lifetime over a sewing machine or in a mine . Trent ! Get a-holt of this : theft is the obligation of the poor !

Property can be unearned , unmerited , extorted , abused , misspent , without losing one iota of its sacred character  --  its religious character . They used to hang a man for stealing a loaf of bread . We do n't do that now : we warp his life and maim his children . I was once given eight months for stealing a bicycle  --  a rich boy 's toy . But I was able to escape and steal another . I NEEDED a bicycle. ? Listen to me : there 's going to be an earthquake .

You 've been thinking that most of ' em would be better off dead . Why , I 'm ashamed of you  --  a nice American boy like you going around killing people . Do n't lie to me !

They know that their sons will be jangling the bedsprings with girls in their arms when the old man is wheezing in a wheelchair . That 's a bitter thought . Second !

Everybody knows that family life is a hell , but if you want to see a family life that 's really beautiful , go back to the zoo . Look at the lions and tigers and bears . They really love their young . They really do .

For thousands of years men have been manufacturing interpretations : life 's a test of our character ; rewards and penalties after death ; God 's plan ; Allah 's Paradise , full of beautiful girls for everybody ; Buddha 's nirvana  --  we get that anyway , it means ' see nothing , feel nothing ' ; evolution , higher forms , social betterment , Utopia , flying machines , better shoelaces  --  nothing but THISTLE DUST !

The children of the Sun reflect the characteristics of Apollo leading the muses in his train , healing , cleansing with light , dispelling mists , prophesying : Thomas Garrison Speidel . The children of Saturn also shed their influence upon the growing man : Roger spent the greater part of the day moving about Chicago and its environs . He returned at intervals to his table in the tumultuous City Room , where he was accustomed to receive visits from persons wanting publicity for a favorite charity , an obituary for a relative ( Roger was very fine at obituaries ) , an advertisement  | for a lost pet . Some came to express approval or indignation . One morning as he was leaving his desk he was approached by a grave bearded man whom he recognized as the prominent lawyer Abraham Bittner . " Mr. Frazier ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Bittner sat down , slowly drew off his gloves , and looked at Roger in silence . " What can I do for you , Mr. Bittner ? " Mr. Bittner 's hands played with an agate fob that dangled from his watch chain . Roger 's eyes kept returning to some words engraved on two sides of the stone . Seeing his curiosity , Mr. Bittner drew out the watch and fob and placed them on the table . He remained silent as Roger looked more closely at the stone . " Are those words in Greek , Mr. Bittner ? " " They are in Hebrew . " Roger raised his eyes inquiringly . " Those words are the motto of a society to which I belong . I am calling on you today as a representative of that society . " " What do those words say , sir ? " " Have you a Bible in this office ? " " We had one . Someone took it .

I represent this society and particularly its directing committee of twelve men . This committee  --  as a mark of esteem for what you are doing for the city of Chicago  --  would like to place a convenience at your disposal . " He paused . " You live in Room 441 at the Thurston House . The street under your windows is noisy until late at night and is particularly so in the early morning . The view from your two windows opens on the brick wall of Cowan 's warehouse . Are these things so ? " " Yes , Mr. Bittner. "  | This committee wishes to rent to you for three years , at one dollar a year , an apartment on the fourth floor at 16 Bowen Street . Four of its windows look out upon the lake . There are absolutely no conditions attached to this offer . It is extended entirely in the interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to receive you from this moment . Here are the keys . Here is a receipt for your signature . " Roger continued to stare at him . Finally he started to speak , but Mr. Bittner arrested him with raised hands . " You will not know the names of these committee members . They do not wish to be thanked . All but two are men of large means  --  very large means . They are Chicagoans . They love this city . They are resolved to do everything in their power to make Chicago the greatest , the most civilized , the most humane , the most beautiful city in the world . They have already extended parks , built fountains , and widened avenues . They contribute largely to the universities , the hospitals , the orphanages , to the rehabilitation of prisoners . You have written of your interest in the planting of trees . The committee has planted groves of oaks in the parks and has prevented others from being cut down . " He lowered his voice . A smile hovered about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who will understand its import . " They are thinking of some Jerusalem here in the future  --  a free Jerusalem .

You have restored a measure of dignity to older men and women in the eyes of their own children . You have called the attention of your readers to deplorable things which it is in their power to alter ? all this in your way . The committee has this fear : that you will leave Chicago , that you will carry on your valuable work in New York or in some other city . " He slowly put his watch and agate fob back into his pocket . The door of the editor 's office opened . Old Hickson appeared  | holding some yellow pages in his hand . He called angrily : " TRENT ! TRENT ! We ca n't print this goddamned slop . Who the hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toes ! Get a bee under your tail ! " Suddenly the editor saw that Roger was entertaining a dignified visitor . He returned to his desk , slamming the door behind him . Roger picked up the keys . " Thank you very much , Mr. Bittner , for what you 've told me . Thank the members of the committee . But I . . . I ... I 'm uncomfortable when I 'm given presents . I 'm sorry , Mr. Bittner , but that 's the way I am . " He laid the keys down soundlessly on Mr. Bittner 's side of the table . " Thank you , I 'm sorry . " Mr. Bittner rose . He smiled and put out his hand . " I shall call on you again in November . " Two nights later Roger walked to the address on Bowen Street . The windows on the fourth floor were dark . He compared the ground plan with that of the corresponding apartment on the first floor , where the windows were lighted and open . There would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He looked long at the lake . But he was just nineteen . Those rooms were for a full-grown man . He did n't want to be a full-grown man yet . Mr. Bittner renewed his offer in November and was again refused . Ashleys do n't take presents . But it gave him a strange feeling , a hushed feeling : he was being watched by the good and the wise . Persons who did not give their names had unlocked his father 's handcuffs and given his father a horse . He tried to recall the words engraved on the stone . . . about a road . . . about deserts . The Archbishop of Chicago had written Mr. Frazier a letter of appreciation on " Trent 's " account of the inauguration of St. Casimir 's Home . He had sent a copy of " A Cap for Florence Nightingale " to his sister , who directed a hospital in Thuringia . When  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | " Do I ? . . . Do I ? ... Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling them is unusual . Your father 's behavior was unusual . Let me say that to my eyes there are some unusual aspects that perhaps you do not see . " Roger waited . " I think I may be able to make clear what I mean by telling you a story . A story . A number of years ago in one of the southern provinces of China there was a wave of hatred against all foreigners . A considerable number were killed . All the members of one of our missions were taken prisoner  --  a bishop , four priests , six sisters , and two Chinese servants . All but the servants were German . Each was placed in a small cell in a long low building made of clay and pebbles . They were allowed no communication with one another . From time to time one or another of them would be led out to be tortured . They expected that at any moment they would be beheaded . However , their execution was delayed and after a few years they were released . Can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Bishop was placed in the central cell of thirteen . What do you think he did , Mr. Frazier ? " Roger thought a moment . " He . . . he started tapping on the walls . He counted the letters of the alphabet . " The Archbishop was delighted . He rose and went to the wall . He rapidly tapped a group of five , then another group of five , then twice . Again Roger thought a moment . " L , " he said . " In German we think of I and J as one letter . " " M , " said Roger . The Archbishop returned to his seat . " This could only be done very late at night and the tapping could only be heard through one wall . So , in the depth of the night messages of love and courage and faith were passed back and forth . Now the jailers had placed the two Chinese servants in the                   @ @
