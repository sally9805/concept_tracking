 | Blackout : Can it Happen in Your Town ? @# There 's only one honest answer to the question posed above . Yes . The recent Northeast blackout demonstrates how . Unless you live in one of a few remaining isolated communities , your electric power system is tied into a grid very much like the one that failed and left 30 million people in the dark . That blackout , the biggest in history , started near Niagara Falls on Nov. 9 last year , spread north to Toronto and east across New York State . Rapidly , the crashing curtain of darkness closed over Rochester , Syracuse , Albany , leaped the state line into Massachusetts and Connecticut , New Hampshire and Vermont , blacked out Boston , Hartford , and thousands of towns and villages all over New England . Finally , 12 minutes after the first flicker . it plunged into New York City . Eight million people at the height of the afternoon homeward rush , swarming along sidewalks , packed sardine-like in subways , jammed in stalled elevators , caught in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Huge , nationwide power grids bring you cheaper and more-reliable electric power . But the tie-ins can also bring disaster , as in the recent Northeast blackout . Here 's the inside story of our power networks @#  | muter trains , were suddenly in the dark . Without traffic lights , the streets turned into a snarl that-would not be untangled for hours . But despite the world-wide publicity it received , several important points have not been widely reported . First : In 1962 , sections of Iowa , Missouri , Kansas , Nebraska , South Dakota , and Minnesota were blacked out in almost precisely the same way , as generating stations went down like a row of dominoes . The same section went dark again about a year ago ? on Jan. 28 , 1965 . In June , a large section of the Southwest was blacked out when an operator threw the wrong switch . Second : While most people were shocked to learn that such a thing could happen , the recent blackout came as no surprise to power engineers , who have always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although previous blackouts have pinpointed specific weaknesses in our electrical systems and methods of dealing with them , preventive measures have not been widely applied . Will the lessons learned in the Great Northeast Blackout help prevent a similar failure where you live ? Let 's make one distinction . We 're not talking about local power failures . These failures are annoying , but usually not serious . But the big ones are more than nuisances . And big cities , with people trapped in subways and elevators , and traffic stalled , are n't the only places they can hurt . More and more of the nation 's homes are becoming totally dependent on electricity for everything ? cooking , heat , light , in many cases water . The grid problem . These big blackouts grow not from local-line or transformer failures , but from far more complex causes involving what engineers call the inter-tie system or grid . Years ago , each community had its own generator . As a town grew , electric companies installed snore generators , but they were all separate . Gradually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could do better by hooking generators together in coordinated systems . Then , if one generator failed or had to be repaired , the others could pick up the load . Then along came high-voltage transmission lines and , with them , the ability to transmit large amounts of electric power over long distances . Now system planners could not only hook generators in one area together , they could put up huge high-voltage lines and connect separate systems . Then companies could swap power on a large scale and help each other in emergencies . Such interconnected systems are called power pools . The system ? most of the time ? works beautifully . In California recently , one company lost a staggering million kilowatts of generating capacity . The lights did n't even blink . Neighboring companies picked up the load instantly . One reason : money . There 's another advantage : Tying separate utilities together saves money . Big generators operate far  | more efficiently than small ones . Two utilities that need more generating facilities now frequently pool their money and build one huge station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and both get power for less than it would cost if they did it alone . Or a company straining to meet its peak load will buy cheap power from a neighboring system rather than run its own inefficient emergency generators . There 's still another reason for pooling . On the Nest Coast , for example , both the northern area and the southern area need a certain steady amount of electricity year-round for lights , TV sets , and so on . In addition , each has a heavy seasonal peak . In the north , the big load comes with electric heating in the winter . In the south , it 's summer air conditioning . With separate systems , each section would have to build enough generating capacity to meet its peak load . With pooling , each can build only enough for its base load , plus a much smaller reserve . Then in the summer , the northern system sends excess power south ; in winter it goes the other way . Peaks occur at different times of day in different sections , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Electric power , of course , ca n't be stored ; it must be made as the customers ask for it . For example , you flip on a light switch . This adds slightly to the load on a generator in the system . Loaded down a little more , the generator slows very slightly . A governor senses the slowdown and feeds more fuel to the generator , bringing it back up to standard speed ? 60 cycles per second . As more and more lights go on , the generator finally reaches its maximum capacity . Then the system operator either starts up another generator or arranges with another company to send in a block of power . Computers keep tabs . To check on the constantly fluctuating demand and to help decide when to buy power , when to make it , and when to sell it to other pool members , most companies now use computers . The computer constantly watches voltages , frequencies , and loads all over the system , and from time to time tells the system operator which generators to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Today , 97 percent of the nation 's generating capacity is tied into these co-op pools . Virtually every generator east of the Rockies is now tied in to one vast grid ; those west  | of the Rockies to another . By this spring , a half-dozen major links now being thrown across the mountains should have combined the two giant pools into one . Grids save money for power companies and their customers . Some engineers estimate that power costs would be more than doubled if every company were on its own . And grids do prevent blackouts . For every November 9 , there are hundreds of emergencies where the pools keep lights on . But the grids also bring a new , ? kind of yuhierability . " Whenever you interconnect in any large system , " says W. I. Kelley , vice-president of Illinois Power Co. , " a byproduct is the possibility of cascading power failures . " Exhibit No .

It starts at the giant hydroelectric plants near Niagara Falls and stretches more than 400 miles to New York City . Along the trunk are its branches , smaller 230-kv , and 138-kv transmission lines . And in the branches of this electrical tree nestle six major power companies and generating facilities and a handful of smaller ones . Major branches spread into New England , jab into Canada . The beginning . The trouble began when a relay in the Sir Adam Beck No. 2 station in Ontario ? one member of the pool ? snapped shut and gave the tree a mighty shake . The shudder rippled down the tree , shaking power plants off . Here 's how it happened . At 5:16 p.m. on Nov. 9 , 1965 , the 15 huge generators in the Beck plant were sending their power north toward Toronto along five giant 230-kv transmission lines . Each of the lines was carrying 350 megawatts ( million watts ) of power . But their overload relays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety margin .

Obviously , there 's little change so far . On Dec. ( i , a similar cascading failure knocked out power in east Texas . For the future , the FPC has made its impressive recommendatwns . But it 's questionable how widely they 'll be applied . After all , we have n't really learned anything new . Power engineers knew cascading blackouts could happen ; they 've happened before . And they 've recommended changes before , too . Following the Midwest failures , for example , investigators came to essentially the same conclusion the FPC reached in December . As a result of the recent blackout , the FPC has indicated that it will push for new laws regulating pools and inter-ties , not simply make suggestions . Can a blackout happen in your town ? Well , there 's less chance of it now than there was a few months ago . But do n't throw away your candles .                  @ @ @
