txt Republicans were urged by President Kennedy today to break party ranks and support his farm bill . In answer to a question at his news conference , the President made what appeared to be an obvious effort to break down the insistence by Republican leaders that the vote on the farm bill in the House next week is a matter of party dis ? cipline . Question 11 , Page 10 . " I think that we have a right to expect that on these matters of great national import  --  that at least we will receive some help from across the aisle , " he said . The bill , which would provide for the stiffest production controls yet devised for key crops if farmers voted for them , presents the " first chance of bringing some order out of what - is a very chaotic situation , " the President declared . The House is scheduled to // take up the farm bill on Monday . The Senate has already adopted a similar measure . The proposed legislation would set up , for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of corn and other livestock feed grains . It would also provide for a new production and marketing quota system for wheat . President Kennedy said again that the farm bill " can save $1 , - 000,000,000 a year to the taxpayers of this country ; over a period of four years , $4,000-000,000 . " " If we fail and our farm bill is defeated , " he went on , " we go back to the program which is in permanent legislation , the Benson program . . . which has brought us tremendous surpluses and expenditures of over ' $6,500,000,000 by the Government every year . " This was a reference to former Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson . The President was also asked whether he might seek repeal of the existing price support legislation if Congress failed to enact the new farm bill . Question 12 . He indicated that he would not . " We do n't want a bill which has no support for the farmers , " he said . " We do n't want to go to Congress and say ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a balance between supply and demand of the kind you have in tobacco and cotton , well now we 're going to pull out and have no support for the farmers . ' " The President made his plea for Republican support of his farm bill in answer to a question whether he had found a formula for persuading some reluctant Democrats to support his legislative program . Democrats , he said , had done 1 " pretty well . " He mentioned the House vote today to raise the debt limit as an example of Democrats ' meeting " their responsibility . " He also cited the tax bill and the trade bill . The farm measure provides for feed-grain and wheat producers to vote in a national refendum on acceptance of the new programs . A two-thirds vote of eligible producers would be necessary for approval . If farmers rejected the programs , then price supports would be sharply lowered under the Senate bill and dropped under the House bill . The Administration is expected to accept an amendment to the House bill to make it conform with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Representative Charles A. Halleek of Indiana , has been bearing down on Republican members this week to keep them in line . Secretary of Agriculture Orville L. Freeman has been engaged in a similar effort to break the Republican ranks and to maintain Democratic strength . Mr. Freeman has already talked to at least twenty-five House Democrats and expects to have conferred with fifty by voting time next week . He has worked hard on urban Democrats . Some of these have turned their back on farm proposals because of mounting costs in the fight to curb surplus production and Government outlays . In a letter to House members , Charles B. Shuman , president of the American Farm Bureau Federation , asserted today that defeat of the bill would be a step toward lower costs because a return to existing legislation would bring an automatic reduction in price supports on corn and expiration of the " costly emergency " programs now in effect on feed grains and wheat . Under the " emergency " programs , farmers are paid to reduce their acreage devoted to these crops .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
