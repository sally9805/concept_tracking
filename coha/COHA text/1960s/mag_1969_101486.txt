SOUTHWEST // 1 . TEXAS ( 5-0 ) 2 . ARKANSAS ( 5-0 ) 3 . HOUSTON ( 3-2 ) // Houston 's defensive coach , Melvin Robertson , had but one thought last week : stopping Ole Miss Quarterback Archie Manning . The practice on Tuesday was an example . Robertson , the smallest of the Cougar coaches , put someone else 's size-12 shoes on his size-9 feet before walking out onto the Astro Turf . It was n't until that night that he noticed the mistake . " They 've been squeaking all night , and I never realized it . Well , I guess that 's the price I pay for thinking about Ole Miss . " Robertson 's concentration paid off . Manning , under severe pressure all night , completed only 11 of 28 passes and ran for 19 yards as Houston upset Ole Miss 25-11 . Manning has n't enjoyed his two games with Houston . He suffered cracked ribs against the Cougars last season . As for this year he said , " It was as rough a game as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Houston 's nearsighted quarterback , would have agreed . His nose was broken on the final play of the first half as he tried to throw a block for Split End Elmo Wright . " The last thing I remember , " said the bloodstained Mullins , " was a knee coming at my face . " But Mullins still managed to complete 13 passes  --  mostly screens  --  for 172 yards and a touchdown . He also scored Houston 's first touchdown on a 12-yard run off the Veer T , the Cougars ' triple option . // Texas and Arkansas , the high and the mighty , marked time awaiting their December face-off . James Street , the Texas quarterback who jabbers to his teammates in the huddles , was given brief opportunity for oratory . After running up a 21-0 lead against Rice in the first half , he was benched . " Street is a tough little rascal , " Coach Darrell Royal explained , " but he 's just bone and flesh . There 's no reason to risk an injury . " Sophomore Eddie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 31-0 slaughter of the Owls . // Reserves gained experience for Arkansas , also . Bill Montgomery and Chuck Dicus , who are the Southwest 's deadliest passing combination , watched the entire Wichita State game from the sideline . Even so , the Razorbacks scored 52 points . But Wichita was n't humiliated . Its 14 points were one more than Arkansas gave up to all four of its previous opponents combined . // Jerry Don Sanders is an unlikely hero . The Texas Tech field-goal kicker is from Earth , Texas , and his nickname is " Hoof , " a reference to his 6 ? shoe size . But Earth had reason to be proud when his 6 ? s kicked a 36-yarder with 16 seconds left to defeat floundering SMU 27-24. // EAST // 1 . PENN STATE ( 6-0 ) 2 . SYRACUSE ( 3-2 ) 3 . WEST VIRGINIA ( 5-1 ) // " We were robbed , " Dartmouth Coach Bob Blackmail told the press after the Harvard game  --  surprising words considering that the Indians had just won their fifth straight of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field . Somebody ransacked our dressing room during the game and stole the players ' rings and watches . " Even before the players discovered the theft , the dressing room was like a tomb . " The team did n't react as if it had won , " Blackman said . " They know they did n't play a good game . " // Harvard 's defense held Dartmouth to 213 yards  --  less than half the Indians ' average . The first-team Dartmouth defense , which has allowed just one touchdown in five games , was responsible for much of Dartmouth 's scoring , as the Indians got all their points in the first 18 minutes as a result of two pass interceptions , a field goal and a 65-yard punt return by Tom Quinn . " You can tell by our eyes how good we are defensively , " said junior Defensive Halfback Russ Adams . " You get in that defensive huddle when you 're under pressure , you look around and you see it in our eyes . " // The talent of Penn State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punts and an interception set up three touchdowns in the Nittany Lions ' 42-3 win over Ohio University . George Landis , who blocked two Syracuse field-goal attempts last week , got a hand on one of the punts . Safety Neil Smith intercepted his seventh pass of the season and the 16th of his career , this one for 70 yards and his first touchdown . State 's defense has now set up 190 points in the last 16 games . Joe Paterno 's team has slipped in the polls , although surprising upsets by Kansas State and Colorado  --  both beaten by the Lions  --  should help remedy that . Right now Paterno has no comment on the rankings , but the amiable coach had some strong words for the poll makers last week . If at the end of the season the Lions are n't ranked as high as Paterno feels they deserve he " will raise the devil . " // The omens were favorable for Pitt before the kickoff in Morgantown , W. Va . Its debating team had scored a split decision with the Mountaineers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Part of an International Communist Conspiracy . " Then Pitt used four co-captains to win its first coin toss this season . But that was the last hurrah , as tough West Virginia won 49-18. // Princeton and Yale remained unbeaten against Ivy League competition . Fullback Ellis Moore scored three times and the defense gave up only four first downs as the Tigers found Penn full of brotherly love , beating the Red and Blue 42-0. // " There are only two Italians I ever lost sleep over , " said Bill Narzuzzi , Yale 's defensive coach , after the Bulldogs had shut out Cornell 17-0 . " The first was my wife and the other was Ed Marinaro . " Cornell 's sophomore running back began the afternoon as the nation 's leading rusher , but Narzuzzi 's crew limited him to 30 yards . The victory extended Yale 's Ivy League unbeaten streak to 17 games . Columbia was less fortunate , losing to Rutgers in the last 36 seconds 21-14. // The brigade of Midshipmen finally got a chance to tear down the goal posts at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season , but the Middies had to stop Virginia twice at the one yard line to preserve the 10-0 victory . // Not to be outdone , Army also won a game , beating Boston College 38-7. // SOUTH // 1 . TENNESSEE ( 5-0 ) 2 . LSU ( 6-0 ) 3 . FLORIDA ( 6-0 ) // Auburn and LSU were treated to the same Friday night pregame emotional inspiration , John Wayne 's recent legendmaker , The Undefeated , and the next day they staged a wild one of their own . In the fourth quarter LSU Coach Charlie McClendon became so excited he gashed his forehead with his fingernail and had to conduct his postgame press conference with a towel pressed to the injury . Early in the last period Auburn went 95 yards in 11 plays to make it 21-20 , LSU . When John Riley entered with his kicking tee , all Baton Rouge figured it would be 21-21 for sure . But LSU Linebacker George Bevan felt otherwise . " We had a strong outside rush when Bill Thomason blocked their field-goal attempt in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This time the man who was supposed to block me moved to the outside again , so I came inside him and caught the ball on my right forearm . " The blocked conversion proved the difference and LSU won its ninth in a row . // McClendon received at least one indication the week before the game that success is spoiling Tiger fans . The coach received a letter from an LSU professor that read , " Dear Mac , You 're passing too much and scoring too many points . The games are n't interesting anymore . Please make them closer , but be damn sure you win . " When reminded of the letter after the victory , McClendon smiled and said , " I hope that prof is happy . If I had known last week this was going to be decided by one point , I do n't think I would have survived . " // Now move on to Florida Field in Gainesville . It is the fourth quarter , and Florida 's 21-7 lead over Vanderbilt has shrunk to 21-20 , with an extra-point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ball soccer-style into the chest of the on-rushing safety , Steve Tannen . Sound familiar ? But , unlike the game in Baton Rouge , the scoring had by no means ended . Tannen went on to intercept two passes , and Gator Quarterback John Reaves continued to throw like Supersoph as Florida won 41-20 . Reaves tossed five touchdown passes in all , three to Carlos ( Chico ) Alvarez , and together they set or broke five school and SEC records . Tannen felt that with a little luck he could have established some records of his own . " Believe it or not , I could have blocked all three extra-point attempts if they had n't kept changing kickers , " he said . " I dove under the first kick , then over the second one . I did n't guess right until the third attempt . " // Ara Parseghian was concerned last week , even if Notre Dame was entering the spongy segment of its schedule . " I was worried about a letdown after the tie with Southern Cal , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I 'm telling you it was one of the worst practices we ever had . So Wednesday I did something we do n't normally do  --  we scrimmaged again . This time we seemed to come out of it . " Parseghian should n't have worried . After a slow beginning Joe Theismann took the Irish 73 yards in eight plays late in the first quarter , and Notre Dame managed an easy 37-0 victory over Tulane. // Southeastern Conference co-leader Tennessee had the week off , so the Vols ' Doug Dickey spent Saturday watching Georgia , his team 's next foe , thrash Kentucky 30-0. // After a bad beating at the hands of Dickey the week before , a loss that virtually eliminated his chance for another conference title this year , Bear Bryant took his Alabama team to Clemson for an afternoon of ego building . The therapy was a 38-13 win , the Bear 's 100th at Alabama . // MIDWEST // 1 . OHIO STATE ( 5-0 ) 2 . KANSAS STATE ( 5-1 ) 3 . MISSOURI ( 5-1 ) // Upsets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Big Eight , but there were some as Wisconsin tripped Indiana in its run for the roses and Iowa nipped Michigan State . // John Coatta , the Wisconsin head coach , was asked if it was special to win on homecoming weekend . For a man who has won just two of 26 games , Coatta 's answer was reasonable : " Any time we win is special to me . " The 56,000 Wisconsin fans , who by now are as conditioned to losing as Charlie Brown , were emotionally drained by the events in Camp Randall Stadium . They had seen sophomore Neil Graff set a school record with four touchdown passes . Roger Jaeger kicked three field goals for the second time this season . Alan ( A-Train ) Thompson gained 100 yards , and it takes more than a colorful nickname for a sophomore running back at Wisconsin to accomplish that . Just ask Greg ( Grape Juice ) Johnson . // Admittedly , the crowd did n't enjoy a completely painless afternoon . Indiana 's Harry Gonso managed four scoring passes himself , three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Badgers gave up the ball five times , four on pass interceptions and once on a fumble . " But Indiana gave it back twice on interceptions and four times on fumbles , so it was pretty even , " Coatta said . Gonso 's 15-yard touchdown pass to Eric Stolberg brought the Hoosiers back to within two points at 36-34 . But the attempted two-point conversion failed when Halfback Bob Pernell was stopped at the one . Then the ball changed hands six times during the last 4 ? minutes . The Hoosiers ' last chance failed in the final seconds when Bill Yarborough intercepted a Gonso pass . // No less exciting was Iowa 's 19-18 victory over Michigan State , which gave the Hawk-eyes their first Big Ten win . Iowa tied the score at 18-18 with less than two minutes left on a six-yard Mike Cilek-to-Kerry Rear-don pass . Alan Schuette , who had contributed field goals in the second and fourth quarters , kicked the winning point . // All was normal at Columbus , however , as Ohio State continued to destroy opponents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buckeyes prepped for the Super Bowl . Woody Hayes presided over his postgame interviews in his patented style . After dispensing with the game by saying , " It was spotty as the devil and we did n't move the ball well inside , " Hayes lectured reporters for 35 minutes on World War I and World War II game plans . An event of less sweeping magnitude took place during the afternoon . Rex Kern passed for 193 yards and ran for 40 more to become Ohio State 's alltime total-offense leader . Kern , just a junior , has 33 more yards than the old record  --  2,555  --  held by Howard ( Hopalong ) Cassady. // Alex Agase heard nothing but talk of Pasadena and the Rose Bowl last week . He was pleased that Northwestern was 2-0 in the Big Ten , but a little joke of Ara Parseghian 's and the prospect of traveling to West Lafayette to play Purdue worried him far more than the prospect of a trip out West in December . Parseghian had sent his former assistant coach a dozen roses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Get them away from me . Wait till I get that guy on the phone . " Purdue 's Mike Phipps did n't help Agase 's mood . He passed for 244 yards and three touchdowns in the Boilermakers ' 45-20 win and moved past Bob Griese as Purdue 's total-offense record holder . // Unbeaten Toledo 's 43-17 romp over Kent State earned at least a share of the MidAmerican Conference title since Bowling Green was stopping unbeaten Miami 3-0 . Toledo 's point total was surprising after Quarterback Chuck Ealey sprained an ankle in the first quarter . Kent State , which had the nation 's No. 2 rusher in Don Nottingham , lost this distinction when Nottingham departed in the opening quarter with a broken finger after gaining only one yard . // WEST // 1 . USC ( 5-0-1 ) 2 . UCLA ( 6-0-1 ) 3 . WYOMING ( 6-0 ) // " This game was the best-kept secret in the history of Los Angeles , " said Southern Cal 's John McKay in reference to USC- Georgia Tech . " On Friday I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's our job to get the kids up to play , but it 's impossible to do if the campus is n't talking about it , the TV commentators are n't talking about it and the writers are n't writing about it . " // McKay 's players , performing in a vacuum , nearly lost . They were behind 18-15 with just over five minutes left to play , when Quarterback Jimmy Jones ran left , intent on a sweep . But he saw Sam Dickerson alone , and it was touchdown . When Tech tried a little hipper dipper on the ensuing kickoff , USC wound up with the ball and , moments later , a cushion touchdown . " We played well , " said Tech 's Bud Carson , " but we gave it away . " The 53,000 spectators in the Coliseum were n't much happier . They spent most of the game wondering about the outcome of another contest in Palo Alto . One USC fan , suffering from the same malady as his team , said , " The NCAA should bar non-conference games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " // Meanwhile , none of the 84,000 in Palo Alto 's Stanford Stadium could find cause for complaint . UCLA , having trailed the Indians 17-6 in the second quarter , had pulled back to 20-20 with 10 minutes left in the fourth . The Bruins considered a tie as appealing as a win , knowing they must beat USC in any case for the Pacific Eight title and Rose Bowl bid . They ran three plays into the line , using up 40 seconds on the clock , and punted . Stanford took over at its own 35 and zip , zip , zip they were at UCLA 's 15 and ready for a field goal . But UCLA 's rush was magnificent . Five Bruins poured in at Jim Cross , the holder , and Kicker Steve Horowitz . Game films later determined that Vince Bischof , the left linebacker , was the man who blocked the attempt . " I felt I had kicked it well , " Horowitz said . " It just never got away . " Comparison of UCLA and USC was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Coach John Ralston , perhaps looking to next year , refused to tread on anyone 's cleats . " They both are the great teams of this or any season . We are in there with them . So I 'd have to say all three of us are among the best in the country . " // Despite racial difficulties ( page 26 ) , Wyoming had an easy afternoon with San Jose State , winning 16-7 . Utah , Wyoming 's challenger for the Western Athletic Conference , won its fifth straight , upsetting Oregon State 7-3 . Quarterback Clint Harden , who replaced Ray Groth in the final quarter , marched the Redskins 81 yards for the game 's only touchdown . Larry Stone , a Utah linebacker , had an exhausting night , making 21 unassisted tackles and nine more assists . The victory was Utah 's first against the Beavers in 22 years .
