LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT 'S OFFICE ( 1620 Montgomery Street ) As he moves down length of large room , we gradually reveal YOUNG MEN and YOUNG WOMEN at work tables on both sides of the central aisle . Most are doing blueprints . Some are constructing scale models of landscape areas . Empty cups of coffee are in evidence on every table . Each of the men and women are distinctively individual in dress and appearance . The pace of the activity and constantly ringing phones indicate all are under pressure . Bullitt nears : 82E . WORK TABLE NEAR END OF OFFICE CATHY , a very pretty girl in early twenties , modishly dressed , is facing DAN MITCHELL : bearded , about thirtyfive . Both are dynamic , unaffected . Cathy 's hair is out of place ; her sleeves are rolled up . Her hands and forearms are sticky with glue and paste from the cardboard model which stands on the table . Some papers are glued to her elbow . The model consists of a tall concave shaft , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the curved surface into an elliptical basin below . &nbsp; CATHY ( demonstrating on model ) We 'll have jets of water spurting under high pressure , from the top of this bronze slab , a hundred and fifty feet high . The curve will contain the spray of the fountain . With respect to the lights , they 'll range from soft to highly intense . We can plug all this into a computer . I see the cycle of lighting repeating itself every two minutes , with a completely new sequence of course , from day to night .  --  27  --  Bullitt appears in b.g . Cathy does n't see him . He stops as he hears : &nbsp; MITCHELLIt looks great in relation to the Plaza . ( Cathy beams ) But it 'll cost too much . You 'd better reduce it in complexity and scale . &nbsp; CATHY ( the artist ) But we need the size ! &nbsp; MITCHELLI need to reduce the budget , Cathy . They exchange looks .

He turns , passes Bullitt , is seen moving to his desk as Bullitt approaches Cathy 's table . &nbsp; CATHYWo n't be long . She gives him a quick peck on the cheek . Before he can speak , VINCE , a young architect , comes between them with a rolled-up technical drawing . &nbsp; VINCE ( in a big hurry ) Hi . He starts to open the big drawing before Cathy . Bullitt is in the way . He is forced to edge aside , feeling excluded as Cathy 's attention is totally taken up by her work .  --  28  --  &nbsp; VINCE ( to Cathy ) Here 's the latest details showing all you need to hook up your fountain . &nbsp; CATHYWhat fountain ?

Bullitt moves beside her . &nbsp; BULLITTWhat 're you doing ? &nbsp; CATHYTrying to scale it down , without losing the effect . She reaches for a book among several propped against the wall . Above them posters can be seen , replicas of those in Bullitt 's hallway . &nbsp; CATHY ( muttering ) Budgets . She opens book to set of figures , starts copying them , computing during : &nbsp; BULLITT ( with smile ) I thought money did n't matter to artists .

She flips it open , finds page she needs , hands book back to Bullitt . &nbsp; CATHYI need some more figures . &nbsp; BULLITT ( reading top of page ) " Friction loss of water in feet per 100 feet length of pipe . Formula using constant 100 . Sizes of standard pipe in inches . " He looks up blankly at her . &nbsp; CATHY ( with smile ) I 'm trying to re-size the mechanical equipment . I want to use 600 gallons of water per minute . What 's the velocity per second of a five inch pipe ? &nbsp; BULLITTWell now , ma'am , that 's a very good question . &nbsp; CATHYLook to the extreme right . Go down the figures til you see 600 .

His voice trails off . &nbsp; CATHY ( bent over drawing ) Yes  --  of a five inch pipe plus the loss in feet . He looks at her , responding to her efficiency . After a moment , she glances up from paper . &nbsp; CATHYWell ? &nbsp; BULLITT ( finally ) I lost my place . . . She ca n't help but give him a warm loving smile , as she reaches for the book .
