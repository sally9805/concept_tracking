For all too many violinists , success means polishing the personal image and sticking to proven works from the standard repertory . Even his best friends admit that Violinist Paul Zukofsky does not have much of a personal image . He is a sad-eyed , dour , defensive loner who will run from a circle of party chatterers rather than make small talk . When he emerges from the wings to perform , it is not with the elegant stride of a Milstein or the open-armed warmth of a Stern . It is with a rapid , open-toed , Chaplinesque shuffle . When Zukofsky plays , his music often consists of a series of brash scrapes , sharp squeaks and galloping glissandos that Mozart , Brahms and Tchaikovsky never dreamed of . Sometimes , it seems that he is a man who cares little for the usual trappings of success . <P> In fact , Paul Zukofsky is the foremost interpreter of contemporary violin music in the U.S. today . At 25 , he indeed cares a great deal about success , except that he has chosen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music rather than in the classics . He need not have done so . His flawless technique and singing interpretative style would have been enough to rank him with any of his contemporaries in the safe world of traditional concert life . But while Zukofsky can , and does , play the classics , he sees himself as a latter-day Liszt , introducing the music of his own time , chronicling it and , since he is a composer himself , writing it as well . <P> By his standards , even Stravinsky and Bartok are somewhat old hat . " The tradition that I am upholding is the tradition of the continuance of music , " he says . He has introduced new works by Milton Babbitt and Krzysztof Penderecki to the U.S. , revived neglected ones by Charles Ives and Ferruccio Busoni . Zukofsky 's 1968 recording of Roger Sessions ' Violin Concerto proved that the music was not only playable , which many a violinist had denied , but that it was perhaps the finest concerto for the instrument ever produced by an American composer . <P> From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was little doubt that Paul would be involved in new and unfamiliar art . His father , Poet Louis Zukofsky , saw to that . Paul started on the violin at age four . After a year of study with Ivan Galamian ( TIME , Dec. 6 ) , Paul made his professional debut at eight with the New Haven Symphony . Meanwhile , his parents had stopped sending their prodigy to school after the first grade , partly because they felt they could do a better job tutoring him themselves . They did . At 13 , Paul won a New York City high school equivalency diploma . At 14 , he entered Manhattan 's Juilliard School of Music . By the time he was 17 , he had played three major recitals in Carnegie Hall . At 20 , he received his Master 's degree from Juilliard . He is now working on his Ph.D . and writing a treatise on contemporary violin technique .
