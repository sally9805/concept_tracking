txt WASHINGTON , June 14-A former Marine helicopter crew chief told a Senate subcommittee today that he had taken four " goof balls , " had drunk a glass of beer , had gotten " high " and then shot and wounded two South Vietnamese soldiers while on a mission . The 23-year-old former sergeant , identified only as " Frank , " said he had flown more than 100 missions in Vietnam and had been under the influence of drugs " a good portion of the time . " Pep pills and barbiturates , he said , were easily available to servicemen either by purchase or by " conning " medical corpsmen . No disciplinary action was taken against him , the Senate group was told , because no one was aware that he was under the influence of drugs // at the time . Frank said he had explained after the shooting incident that he had thought the South Vietnam troops were Vietcong . He was honorably discharged last year , after four years of service . Frank , accompanied by his wife , was introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baird , director of the Haven Clinic , a narcotics treatment center in Harlem . Dr. Baird testified that he was concerned about the " increased amount of addiction of boys in the armed services . " He urged more careful screening at pre-induction centers , ex-plaining : " used on the statistics that I have seen plus talking to various addicts and other servicemen in New York , Miami , California , Boston and New Jersey , I would predict that there are a minimum of 10 to 15,000 heroin and barbiturate addicts in the service and easily 100,000 marijuana smokers . " Senator Jacob K. Javits , Republican of New York , said the subcommittee would ask the Defense Department for a report on the situation . A Pentagon spokesman said there would be no immediate comment . However , he said that South Vietnam would be asked for a report on the shooting incident related by Frank . Dr. Baird said that Frank had first purchased pep pills and barbiturates in Jacksonville , N. C. , while stationed at nearby Camp Lejeune . He said Frank later obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tenn. , where some " of the boys in the service would feign sickness , saying they were obese , so they could get dexedrine , or they could not go to sleep and were given barbiturates . " Then , Dr. Baird said , they would sell the pills to other servicemen . Dr. Baird said that Frank had later purchased some heroin in Hong Kong and had become addicted . Frank testified that he was now going on his " eighth day " without drugs . The subcommittee also heard today from a user of some drugs who had no complaints about them ? Allen Ginsberg , author of " Howl , " " Kaddish " and other poems , including one he wrote today for the occasion . The new one included this description of the scene today in the caucus room : " Under the giant chandeliers , boxed by marble and a red carpet , rolled out for the senators and the drug addicts . . . " Mr. Ginsberg told the subcommittee of his " trips " under the influence of LSD and said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for President Johnson . The 40-year-old poet argued against passage of anti-LSD legislation . Instead , he said , the Government should undertake a " massive research " effort into the drug . This , he said . would enable young " persons who wanted to avail themselves , to have the chance " to use the hallucination drug under proper circumstances . Under questioning by the , acting subcommittee chairman , Quentin N. Burdick , Democrat of North Dakota , Mr. Ginsberg said he had also used marijuana . He said there might be some " marginal " danger in using LSD , particularly to those with certain mental problems , but he saw " no. danger at all in marijuana . " Henry L. Giordano , the Commissioner of Narcotics , told the subcommittee that possession of LSD should be a Federal offense . The illicit traffic in the drug , he said , is becoming a serious problem . The subcommittee is holding hearings on a House-passed bill that would offer narcotics addicts charged with Federal crimes the chance for cure instead of prison . The bill would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addicts who show promise of cure .
