Appalling reports continued to roll in . So far as is known , close to 8,000 babies have been born deformed because their mothers used a **26;2474;TOOLONG called thalidomide ( TIME , Feb. 23 ) . All this added up to the greatest prescription disaster in medical history . Thanks to the intuition of the Food and Drug Administration 's Dr. Frances Kelsey , * the U.S. has got off lightly because the drug was never licensed for general use . In the half dozen reported U.S. cases of birth malformations due to thalidomide , the drug was obtained from abroad . Even so , the testing and marketing of new drugs in the U.S. are now almost certain to get close federal regulation . <P> President Kennedy led off his press conference last week with a demand for " additional protection to American consumers from harmful or worthless drug products . The United States has the best and most effective food and drug law of any country in the world . . . Nevertheless , the drug was given to many patients on an investigational basis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( who used to be a pharmacist himself ) summoned his Government Operations subcommittee to hear FDA Commissioner George P. Larrick and Pharmacologist Kelsey . Canadian-born Dr. Kelsey , 48 , a low-heeled , no-nonsense woman who has practiced medicine besides teaching pharmacology , was a new employee at FDA in September 1960 . Her first major assignment was to pass on the application of Cincinnati 's William S. Merrell Co. for a license to market thalidomide in the U.S. under the trade name Kevadon. * Along with the application came a sheaf of reports on years of animal testing and human use of the drug in Europe . There was no hint that the drug had any undesirable side effects , and Merrell pressed hard for quick approval . But Dr. Kelsey was puzzled because the drug did not put animals to sleep . She wondered about other possible differences between its effects in animals and in man . Dr. Kelsey asked Merrell for more tests . <P> While she waited , Dr. Kelsey chanced on a British report that thalidomide might cause a tingling neuritis in some patients . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspected that this minor effect on adults might signal a more serious effect on the unborn . But not until nearly ten months later , in the last days of November 1961 , did German reports link thalidomide with the European epidemic of seal-like , limbless babies . <P> Though Dr. Kelsey had kept Kevadon off the U.S. market for more than a year , this did not mean that no U.S. doctors were using the drug . ( It was licensed in Canada , where at least 56 cases of deformed babies have been reported . ) Last week Merrell reported that instead of the 100 or so U.S. physicians previously estimated to have got samples of the drug " for investigational use only , " 1,231 had received Kevadon . How much of the drug each doctor got and used was unknown , so there was no way of estimating how many of the terrible blue tablets were still around . ( In December 1961 , the company warned U.S. doctors not to give Kevadon to women who might be or might become pregnant . In March 1962 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
