If there is anything a girl skier dislikes more than a better girl skier , it is the girl who sits in the lodge and never skis at all . Because the " snow bunny " is lazy , scheming , and a fake ? No . Simply because fashion has always seemed to be in her favor . Bundled up in a puffy parka that threw her best curves to the wind , the genuine skier did not stand a chance against the indoor snow job , with her tight turtleneck and clinging stretch pants . Now , however , the sleek look is getting off the chaise longue and hitting the slopes . <P> Hottest news for the cold season are tailored outfits made from a new super-stretch fabric that feels more comfortable , sticks much closer to the facts . For $65 , Jack Winter has whipped up a stretch suit with a thin , double-breasted jacket that would look more familiar in a Courreges workshop than on a practice slope . Sleeker still is a $40 White Stag jump suit with a neckline that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweater , a turtleneck jersey-or whatever front a girl wants to put on . <P> Another variation on the theme is a stretch suit ( Ernest Engel : $130 ) that features a convertible collar and bell-bottom pants that fit-over the boot ( an inner sleeve runs inside the boot to keep out the snow ) . Even knickers , once available only in bulky corduroy and baggy wool , now come in stretch-fabric that hugs the hips and thighs tighter-and rather more attractively - than a girdle . <P> For those who can not kick the coat habit , fashion designers are now serving up fun furs instead of practical parkas . Some are strictly fluff and nonsense , like Revillon of Saks Fifth Avenue 's $5,550 chinchilla jacket with matching boots . Others are almost tough enough to tumble in , like Walt Stiel 's $375 mustang , stenciled to look like giraffe . Still others have prices that are actually fun , like McGregor 's $50 mock crocodile jacket . <P> Because tailored suits are not tailored for the cold and fun furs are not sealed off against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for today 's skier ) , many ski shops are pushing " layered dressing . " Lord &; Taylor suggests that customers start with Ban-Lon long Johns ( $7 ) , then don a nylon T shirt ( $5 ) and a featherweight nylon Windbreaker ( $7 ) . <P> If tailored togs and thin skins do not prove as warm as the traditional thick parkas , the girls have one consolation-they can get that much closer to their dates riding up in the chair lift .
