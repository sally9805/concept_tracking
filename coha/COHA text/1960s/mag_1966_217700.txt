10:30 P.M. Summer . As the faithful friend , longtime Svengali , and now the husband of Melina Mercouri ( they were married last May ) , Director Jules Dassin periodically attempts to trap some of her wild Greek energy on film . His tempestuous Trilby , in her sixth Dassin movie , proves just one thing : the family that plays together does not alway make a Never on Sunday . <P> A Greek bearing gifts of a Mercourial nature can only squander them in this lurid , leaden adaptation of a novel by Marguerite Duras , who also wrote Hiroshima , Mon Amour . While the screen moodily changes color , turning from light sepia to silvery grey and all but blushing with shame , Melina plays up the purple of her role as a sort of sick Samaritan . " How do you stond dee pain ? " she wheezes , speaking of life itself . " Geev me a dhrink , Paul . " But liquor is the least of her problems . Voyeurism and incipient lesbianism are enough to make any young matron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Peter Finch ) , she tries during a trip through Spain to stir the embers of eroticism by packing him off to bed with her best friend ( Romy Schneider ) . One memorable night , as a storm rages outside , she sees Romy and Peter on a balcony in an alfresco embrace , heedless of wind , rain and lightning . Meanwhile , a murderer fleeing a crime of passion appears on an adjacent roof , and Melina decides to help him . Why ? To that question there is a multiple-choice answer : 1 ) she is desperate for excitement , 2 ) she is romantic and immature , 3 ) she is a fanatic sexistentialist , or 4 ) 10:30 P.M. Summer hits the high mark of silliness . Pick ' em all .
