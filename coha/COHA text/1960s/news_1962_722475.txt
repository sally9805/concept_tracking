txt One of the first steps Americans must take to solve their " No. 1 social problem " - broken homes  --  is to persuade wives to obey their husbands , Evangelist Billy Graham asserted in a sermon last night . Husbands have not only a right but a duty set forth in the Bible to be the " master in the house , " Graham said in discussing American family life . He spoke before an audience of 24,000 in McCormick Place on the sixth day of his Chicago revival . The majority of his listeners were women . " Decisions " Made by 497 A total of 497 persons came ' forward to make " decisions for Christ . " " We have in America today a lot of women who have as-1 sumed the authority in their faTilies their husbands should have , " Graham said . " Some of them have had to take the lead , " he added , " because they have married the kind of men who refuse to assume their proper responsibilities . " Graham warned that broken homes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our civilization . " " The destruction of homes does not often make headlines , " he said , " but , like termites , it is eating away at the heart and core of the structure of our nation . This malignant growth eats its way into the vitals of national life . " Millions of Americans have come to regard lightly the vows taken at marriage . As a result , we ' are rapidly surpassing all other nations in the rate of divorce , to say nothing of a host of annulments . Raps " Endurance Contests " " And the divorce record does not tell the whole story . In many homes where the husband and wife continue together , their marriages take on the characteristics of an endurance contest in an attempt to hold together until the bitter end for social or other reasus . " It is time , said Graham , " that our so-called experts on marriage , the family , sex , and the home turned to the Bible . " " In the Bible we have laws and regulations governing marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulations were followed carefully in every home , I guarantee there would be no such thing as divorce or unhappiness in the American home . " The basic reasons for unhappiness in our homes are found in the fact that we have departed from God 's word . " Graham made it clear that tho the husband is the head of a biblically regulated home , he is by no means free of restraint . " The husband , " he said , " is to be a living example of all the things ' that are true , honest , just , pure , lovely , and of good report , according to the Bible 's teaching . " And a man who is unfaithful to his wife in thought , Word , or deed has committed one of the greatest sins known to God and man . " He told his listeners that all the duties of a husband toward his wife are summed up in the text , " love your wife . " Rules for Children " And you husbands must remember , " said Graham , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wives are not playthings , a mere ornament in your homes . Your wife is your helpmeet in all the affairs of life . " Women should remember , Graham said , that they must help keep their husband 's love for them alive . " Use makeup , " he suggested , " but do it so you ca n't quite tell . Wear your best house dress to welcome your husbands and do n't let your husbands come home to a house that is slovenly and dirty . The Bible is against slovenliness . " Grahamturned to the Bible , also , for rules about children in the home . " The Scripture teaches , " he declared , " that children are to obey and respect their parents . And if a child does not obey , says the Bible , then he should be disciplined , " The revival will continue thru June 16 in McCormick Place , and the final meeting will be held June 17 in Soldiers ' field .                @ @ @ @ @
