The thing seemed straight out of a science-fiction thriller . It floated inches off the ground , sounded like a chain saw , and maneuvered like a drunken crab . The contraption stopped alongside a plane bound for Los Angeles , and Oakland Mayor John Houlihan stepped out onto the deck , shouting into a microphone : " Gentlemen , this has been a wonderful experience ! We 're really going to pioneer in this field . " The mayor was inaugurating the first scheduled passenger service in the U.S. of a Hovercraft , the British-designed flying machine that rides above the ground on a cushion of compressed air , can skim both land and sea ( provided there are no major hills or waves ) at a brisk 85 m.p.h . This one had just floated over San Francisco Bay , scooted up a ramp without breaking stride , and roared on across the Oakland airstrip to its destination . The scheduled shuttle between the Oakland and San Francisco airports should prove the perfect opportunity for the Hovercraft to show its stuff . Cheaper to run than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craft can cozy right up to an airplane , load up and transport its 15 passengers to a terminal on the other side of the bay so smoothly that they will not know when they are riding over cement or sea . Not that the ship is a veritable magic carpet . The engine makes so much noise that passengers have difficulty carrying on a conversation , and the forced air kicks up so much dust and spray that the visibility through the windows is almost zero . But the engineers are learning fast . Early in the spring , a test Hovercraft capsized while making a high-speed turn , but that has not happened since .
