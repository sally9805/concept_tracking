Atop one of Jerusalem 's olive-tree-cluttered ridges stands one of man 's most unusual monuments to the past . Against the skyline , a white-tiled dome swells from a watery moat to contrast with a black basalt wall aflicker with flames . These dramatic structures mark the new home , dedicated last week , for Israel 's collection of Dead Sea Scrolls ( see opposite ) . <P> Necessary Mystery . When the U.S. team of architects , M.I.T.-trained Armand Bartos and Viennese-born Frederick Kiesler were approached by the Israeli government and asked to build a shrine for the scrolls , they knew that a boxlike building could fulfill the function . But they were struck by the historic coincidence in 1947 of the discovery of the 2,000-year-old scrolls in the Essene-sect caves with the re-emergence of the state of Israel . Deciding that the twin events cried out for symbolic representation , they found their guideline in the mystery that man from time immemorial has associated with caves . <P> " This will be the first ideological building in our time dedicated to the rebirth of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , " the scrolls are not visual as a Rembrandt is visual . Only scholars can actually decipher them . It was up to us to say something about them . We built up an air of mystery . " This they did by burrowing the bulk of the shrine underground like a cave . <P> Induced Meditation . Visitors must enter from a sunken patio below the wall , instinctively ducking as they pass through the low bronze gates . Once inside , they move down a dim 70-ft. corridor , whose ominous overhead arching is shaded from grey into black . At the end beckon gleaming golden doors , which will open automatically as visitors approach and release them into the dazzling dome ( see overpage ) . <P> Rising high in the center stands a bronze fountain , girdled beneath by the 22-ft. - long Scroll of Isaiah ; the fountain sends a jet of water through an opening in the dome to baptize the exterior tile . Says Kiesler : " It is a purification , just as the Dead Sea sect purified themselves in water thrice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbly red rock , lined with relics that reveal the life of the 2nd century Jewish rebels who fought the Romans from their caves . Emerging from the sanctuary , the visitor travels along a 150-ft. - long roofless corridor . The architects intend this as a period of induced meditation for departing visitors . <P> The Superlatives Fit . " The effect is a bit like being taken to visit the cask of Amontillado , " said one awed viewer last week . " You wonder if you 'll ever get out . " Some Israelis have questioned whether the scrolls merit all the lavish architectural theatrics ; Jerusalem children have taken to calling it " the Chinese pagoda . " But after inspecting it , supporters have rallied to its defense .
