OUT OF THE RED ( 244 pp. ) - Caskie St ; nnetf-Random House ( $3.95 ) . <P> <P> The small island of Equatoria floats like a banana peel on the blue ocean swell of the Caribbean . The democratic Equatori-ans are engaged in their annual ritual revolution , and two local swindlers named Lopez and Pardo dread the rising " reform " dictator . Lopez mulcts tourists and gets a kickback from the police . This pair of wily thugs equip shifts of demonstrators to parade before the U.S. embassy with slogans suggesting that the latest revolutionary coup is a Communist takeover . The hoax works . Soon U.S. planes are flying the Equatorian " Freedom Fighters " to Washington . The fact that the " resistance heroes " consist mainly of Lopez , Pardo and nightclub floozies scarcely fazes ERRA , the Equatorian Refugee Relief Administration , which is shortly manned by 3,000 paper shufflers . Since " revolutions become habit-forming , " Lopez and Pardo vamoose , and the Equatorian girls run away to strip houses to practice " the coldest profession . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the public relations hero of Out of the Red , is the only man in the bureau who actually knows and rather relishes the fact that there is nothing left to administer . When his comic invention flags , Author . Stinnett pads with ferocious puns ranging from descriptions of lustful pals ( " a wolf in cheap clothing " ) to abstract art ( " a merry old mobile " ) . <P> As a onetime paper-proliferator and information-spreader for the War Production Board , Humorist Caskie Stinnett , 47 , knows his subject but does not really know what to do with it . The trouble is that bureaucracy all but defies satire-because it is satire . The facts are funnier than any imaginable fiction .
