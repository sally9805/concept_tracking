Dirty air decays buildings , cracks rubber tires , ruins nylon stockings and worsens all sorts of human ailments . According to one Government study , air pollution costs Americans an average $65 a year ; the figure may hit $200 in particularly filthy cities like New York and St. Louis . Even so , most citizens have a lot to learn about pollution . When a sampling of St. Louis residents were polled on how much they would pay in higher taxes to clean up the air , they reckoned that the effort might be worth 500 a year , at most $1 . Ignoring their own auto-exhaust fumes , they also insisted that dirty air is primarily industry 's problem . <P> Not quite-but in St. Louis that view is understandable . One reason : the National Lead Co. ' s titanium pigment plant routinely emits a sulphuric acid stench that is downright sickening . The city is also a booming center of the chemical industry , prolific source of exotic effluents like phthalic anhydride and chlorinated phenolic compounds , which make the eyes water and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All too often St. Louis stinks , as one resident says , " like an old-fashioned drugstore on fire . " <P> Quick Sniffers . Now one of the key villains is trying hard to turn hero . Until two years ago , Monsanto , the nation 's third largest chemical company , paid little attention to the effects of the more than 300 products it makes at its headquarters plants around St. Louis . Then the city enacted some of the toughest air pollution ordinances in the U.S. Monsanto not only obeyed the laws-it set out to become a model antipolluter . <P> Monsanto has studied every vent in its four huge plants in the area , evaluating every chemical process , and monitoring the effectiveness of " scrubbers , " " eliminators " and other controls . " What the company is doing is very complex and very expensive , " says Charles Copley , Commissioner of the St. Louis air pollution control board . <P> Though its workers become indifferent to chemical odors , Monsanto itself goes to the opposite extreme . As soon as any employee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the factory phone . If the problem is serious , expert " sniffers " hurry to the scene , ready to bottle the air , analyze it and repair the leak . Elaborate ductwork in one factory connects the points where noisome phenols might be emitted and whisks them to a scrubber system that removes the odor with absorbent filters . Since 1967 , Monsanto has spent almost $3,000,000 to curb pollution in St. Louis , plus another $12 million at its other plants across the nation . <P> Booming Business . As it turns out , the spending has produced profits as well as civic status for Monsanto . The company 's industrial efficiency has been increased by the constant monitoring of all its processes . In addition , it is now recapturing some valuable chemicals that previously went up the stacks , while selling a new line of pollution-abatement equipment to other industries . Thus Monsanto has moved into a growing market that it estimates may soon reach $6 billion a year . " By 1975 , we hope to be doing $200 million a year in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monsanto 's new department , Environmental Control Enterprises .
