For Old Soldier Dwight Eisenhower , no battle holds more lasting interest than a three-day conflict in which he never fought . Ike first visited Gettysburg as a West Point cadet assigned to traipse the fields and trace the engagement 's moves and countermoves . As a World War I lieutenant colonel , he was stationed there at a temporary Army post called Camp Colt . In 1950 , as a retired general , he bought a farm on the battlefield 's edge . As President of the U.S. , he entertained such guests as Viscount Montgomery . Winston Churchill , Charles de Gaulle and even Nikita Khrushchev with fragmentary accounts of the battle . And last week , enjoying the uncluttered leisure of retirement , Ike , for the first time , hosted a full-length battlefield tour . <P> Women in Camp . The guests at the day-long outing were 38 freshmen Republican Congressmen . Gettysburg was hot , but their host was in cool good humor . Attempting to point out the wheatfields across which Pickett 's divi sion made its ruinous charge , Ike discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked that the bus be moved , one Congressman quipped , " Is that an executive order , Mr. President ? " Chortled Ike , when the bus driver was slow in moving : " And obeyed just about as rapidly . " Climbing aboard one of the congressional buses , Ike handled a microphone like a veteran tour guide , * broadcast a military man 's running estimate of Civil War generals : " Never in the war did Lee establish good staff work . . . The two best men the Union had were McDowell and Pope , until they got Meade . . . One of the biggest problems was keeping women out of Hooker 's camp . . . Kilpatrick sent two brigades of Union cavalry to charge the southern flank , and they were butchered . That cavalry ca n't charge has been true since Ney tried to win at Waterloo . " <P> A principal point pressed home by Ike was that Gettysburg was fought more for political than for military reasons . " The Confederacy needed recognition from European powers , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battles . " The explanation served as a timely backdrop to a discussion of more recent military-political battles . After lunch at the Gettysburg Hotel , Ike agreed to answer questions from the Congressmen . Immediately , he was asked whether it was true that Berlin 's troubles were born when he , as Commander of World War II Allied forces , failed to move on that city . Said Ike , recalling the late war period in which Churchill pushed for Allied occupation of Berlin and Roosevelt did not : " We were soldiers , not politicos ... To say that any military decision would have saved this present difficulty with Berlin is just rewriting history . " From Berlin , the discussion moved to the invasion of Cuba . Ike denied that the invasion strategy had been planned by his Administration . Said he : " These Cuban refugees had a great desire to go back to Cuba , so we began organizing them and giving them weapons and training them . But beyond that we could not go , because at that time there was no recognized leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
