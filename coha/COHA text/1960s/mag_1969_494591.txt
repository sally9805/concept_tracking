Fear of a Bloodbath by Tran Van Dinh The possibility of a " bloodbath " in South Vietnam if US troops were to swiftly withdraw has been worrying both " hawks " and " doves . " But the Vietnamese likely to be the most affected by a change of regime in Saigon , or by a Communist take-over the wealthy and powerful do not talk much about it : they have been getting ready ever since the Tet offensive of 1963 , which brought the war into their cities and their air-conditioned living rooms . A quiet exodus began , mostly to France . The price of exodus is not cheap . An exit visa costs as much as $5000 ; a " certificate of French citizenship " costs about $2000 ; illegal border crossings into Cambodia cost anywhere from $800 to $4000 . Money has been deposited in European banks . According to Allessandro Cassella of Die Weltwoche of Zurich a total of between $1.5 and $2 billion has left Vietnam in this way . According to the same journalist , President Nguyen Van Thieu has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brother is ambassador ) , and his wife has just purchased a house in Europe . He estimates that of i600 Vietnamese who are legally leaving this country each month , half do not return , MR . TRAN VAN DINH 'S last post in the South Vietnamese diplomatic service was that of Charge d'affaires in Washington in 1963 . In 1960 he was a member of the South Vietnamese Cabinet , holding the portfolio of Director General of Information , and was also a member of the National Security Council . which means that approximately io , 000 have emigrated since the negotiations started in Paris . My own estimates are a bit higher . Those who can not afford or who do not wish to leave , have gone through a well-planned process of accommodation with the " other side , " an accommodation that reaches the highest echelons of the government . Huynh Van Trong , special assistant to President Thieu , was arrested in July this year with 42 others on charges of having contacts with the Vietcong . They were scheduled for trial November 28 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has noted , " tacit accommodations are not unusual in many areas such as the Mekong Delta " ( Foreign Affairs , January 1969 ) . One wonders who will be left among the prospective victims . The here-and- , now bloodbath is real , however . For the majority of Vietnamese , poor peasants in the defoliated countryside and destitute workers in the city slums , it is what they have been witnessing a long time : the search and destroy missions ; the " free zone " strikes ; the B52 saturation bombings ; the Phoenix operation ( which from December 1967 to December 1868 killed 18,393 civilian Vietcong cadres ) ; the Song My ( " Pinkville " ) type of breakfast massacre in which an American infantry unit allegedly shot down some hundreds of men , women and children in a captured village in the early morning of March 16 , 1968 ; the atrocities regularly described in national magazines ( Esquire , Look , The New Yorker ) . To talk about a future massacre against this present background is ironic , to say the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem is to admit the US has a role to play in the internal affairs of Vietnam after the war . I ask myself if earlier Americans would have been impressed by the reprisal argument , if it had been raised by the British before they left American shores after the War of Independence ? Would it have carried much weight if , during the Civil War , a European country had intervened on behalf of either the North or the South , and then refused to leave on the grounds that withdrawal would leave the people of the North ( or the South ) at the mercy of aggressors ? Nonetheless , the question needs to be discussed , if only because it is raised by many Americans whose compassion for the Vietnamese people and whose opposition to the war I do not doubt . But in doing so , we must examine two underlying myths : the first is that the " Orientals put little value on life and take killing very lightly " ; the second is that reprisals are the monopoly of the Communists , whereas anti-Communists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reading of Western history : the religious wars , the Inquisition , the lynchings , the World Wars , the American Indian and Civil Wars , Hitler 's " final settlement . " Anyone who has spent time in Vietnam realizes that the peasant esteems life very highly . The Oriental is no more brutal , no more casual about death than is the Occidental , irrespective of politics . Since 1945 , Vietnam has gone through a revolution and revolutions are always bloody , but the blood is on all hands . Mr. Kissinger recognized this when he wrote : " It is beyond imagination that parties that have been murdering and betraying each other for 25 years could work together as a team giving joint instructions to the entire country . " The French , whom the US helped to fight against the Viet Minh during the first Indochinese War , murdered a large number of Vietnamese nationalists and Communists alike , in both the North and the South . In November , 1945 , French artillery fire and air bombardment killed 6000 fleeing Vietnamese civilians at Haiphong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many Americans believe that the Vietnamese Catholics will be the sure victims of future reprisals . Thus , President Nixon in his address on November 3 mentioned the " million-and-a-half Catholic refugees who fled to South Vietnam when the Communists took over the North . " The President 's statistics were inflated . According to Vietnam Past and Present published in Saigon in 1956 under the patronage of the South Vietnam Department of Education and the National Commission for UNESCO ( p. 374 ) and written by Mr. Thai Van Kiem , a Vietnamese diplomat and scholar , the total number of refugees was : 887,895 of whom 85 percent or 754,710 were Catholics . Also , some ioo , 000 Vietnamese left the South for the North in 1954 , several thousands of whom were Catholic . There are now about 8o0,0oo Catholics in North Vietnam . There are Catholics in the leadership of the National Liberation Front . Those who predict the wholesale murder of Catholics by Communists sound more Catholic ( and more anti-Communist ) than the most anti-Communist Catholic leader in South Vietnam , Father Hoang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quynh led a guerrilla army against the Viet Minh , and in 1954 he moved south with his faithful . Recently , he said : " If the Communists come , we will try and live and adapt here . " ( Newsweek November 24 , 1969 ) In the last three years , he has worked out a close relationship with Venerable Thich Tri Quang , the militant Buddhist leader whom some in the US consider pro-Communist . Father Hoang Quynh knows very well that security lies in close association with your own people , not with a foreign army . In a communique on January S , 1968 , the Conference of Bishops in Vietnam appealed to " the goodwill of the government of both South and North Vietnam to build peace together : in the name of the Lord , we cry Stop . " In early November this year , 93 prominent Vietnamese Catholics from France , West Germany , Canada and in Vietnam called for the immediate withdrawal of US troops . Among the signers of this appeal was Colonel Nguyen Van Chau , for several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARVN ( Army of the Republic of South Vietnam ) . ( The colonel recently sent a letter supporting the October and November Moratoriums in the US . ) In recent months Saigon has given wide publicity to " mass executions and mass graves " in Hue , digging up bodies for the press and photographers . Yet , Colonel Ton That Khien , chief of Quang Ngai province ( " Pinkville " ) , where the March 16 , 1968 massacre of Vietnamese women and children took place , refused to dig up the bodies of the victims , saying that " they are old bodies " ( Evening Star , November 17 , 1969 ) . Why are the Hue bodies new and the Quang Ngai old , when they were buried at the same time ? President Nixon said : " We saw the prelude of what would happen in South Vietnam when the Communists entered the city of Hue last year . During their brief rule there , there was a bloody reign of terror in which 3000 civilians were clubbed , shot to death and buried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President 's mention of Hue , my home town . The 1968 Tet offensive took two victims in my own family : my younger brother , a noncommissioned officer in the ARVN and a published poet , and my nephew . They were both killed not by the Vietcong but by American bombings . They were buried in a temporary grave for the reason that Hue was under siege ; nobody could get out of the area to buy a coffin For decent burial . The first news I received from an official Saigon source was that my relatives were killed by the Vietcong . Only much later , when I got word from my own family , did I learn that they had been killed by the bombings . What happened in Hue is told in an account that appeared in The Christian Century of November 5 , 1969 . The author , Len E. Ackland , now a graduate student at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies , worked and lived in Hue in 1967 . He returned there after the Tet offensive of 1968 to interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " When on the first day of the attack , about 20 Vietcong entered Gia Hoi ( a precinct of 25,000 residents in Hue ) in order to secure the area , they carried with them a list of those who were to be killed immediately as ' enemies of the people . ' According to Le Ngan , director of Hue 's special police , the list consisted of five names , all those of officers of special police . " The Catholic priest in Gia Hoi told him that " none of his clergy or parishioners were harmed by the NLF . " When the 1968 Tet offensive started , I suggested to an acquaintance of mine whom I thought was close to the Saigon policy makers , that Hue should be declared an open city as was Rome during the Second World War , and for the same reasons . Had that been done , the loss in lives , the damage to historical sites and treasures would have been minimized . Instead of which , the ARVN ( which disappeared at the first Vietcong shot ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " destroy the city in order to save it . " Hue authorities never explained why they failed to protect the people . Nor did they reveal the number of people killed by American bombings and artillery . Few know the Vietcong better than Tran Van Dac , a Vietcong colonel who defected last year . In an interview published by the Joint US Public Affairs Office in Saigon , Tran Van Dac said : " If the Vietcong took over , they would send military officers and former civil servants to concentration camps to be reeducated , in some cases to hard labor until they become submissive . And of course , all those whose social class or former position makes them objects of suspicion would be carefully watched by the authorities . To me , the people of Vietnam and especially the peasants who have been militarily and politically trained in the last two decades by the revolutionaries would not be easily terrorized . They are tougher and much more sophisticated than their apparent apathy seems to indicate . In 1956 , . two years after the prestigious victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late President Ho Chi Minh , the peasants in Nghe An , Ho Chi Minh 's home province , revolted against the excesses of land reforms . President Ho Chi Minh admitted the mistakes publicly and took over the Secretary Generalship of the party to correct them . " If the reason for continuing the US military presence in South Vietnam is to prevent a bloodbath , then13 the logical thing to aim for , right now , is a broad-based Saigon regime that includes Buddhists , whose nonviolent position has been always clear and consistent , the peace-minded generals such as Duong Van Minh ( Big Minh ) or Tran Van Don . That would be a negotiating government . The Thieu-Ky-Khiem regime is not only an obstacle to negotiations , but polarizes the situation among non-Communist elements as well . " Vietnamization , " which attempts to consolidate Thieu 's regime , simply increases the likelihood of reprisals . Those who fear a Vietcong bloodbath ought to consider other possibilities too . What will happen , for example , to thousands of political prisoners ( among them Truong Dinh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemned to five years at hard labor ) , if there is no negotiated settlement ? Judging from many threats directed against the neutralists and the peace-minded by the Saigon regime , they would be liquidated by Thieu and his friends the day those leaders decided to quit the country . Thieu has already launched a campaign against his political opponents , accusing them of being Communists . Or consider this : Senator Cranston ( D , California ) , Newsweek- and Time have referred to a Pentagon " contingency plan " to fight the South Vietnamese Army , should negotiations fail . This is not as absurd as it may seem . Anti-American feelings in the South have risen since the Paris talks . The " Vietnamization " program has brought into positions of command young ARVN officers , who , unlike the generals , have never been associated with the French army . They are products of the South Vietnamese military schools since 1954 . They are now part of an anti-Communist army , but they are not anti-nationalist ; they know what is going on among their leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several cases where officers of the ARVN have been demoted because of their close connection with their American advisers . General Ky himself has tried to exploit this anti-American sentiment among young officers . More than once , he has said that if he had to choose again , he " would be on the side of Ho Chi Minh . " The young majors and captains do not have money in fOreign banks , they are not going to leave en masse after the Americans go home . But to stay with their people , they either have to find the way to accommodate with the " other side , " or prove by their actions that they are as patriotic as the Vietcong . The best proof might be to fight the US " residual force . " In June of this year , two US military police who had rushed to a bar in response to complaints that a drunken US soldier was making trouble were shot to death by Colonel Nguyen Viet Can , commander of the Vietnamese airborne battalion that guards the Independence Palace . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again rightly notes : " The Vietnamese people have lived under foreign rule for approximately half of their history . They have maintained a remarkable cultural and social cohesion by being finely attuned to the realities of power . " To many Vietnamese the realities of power since the Paris talks are shifting . An attack by the ARVN against the US troops would be the final blow . Finally , ' resident Thieu and the US Embassy in Saigon have claimed that the pacification program has been going extremely well , that the South Vietnamese government controls more than So percent of the population . If this were true , then over a million ARVN troops and US residual forces could stage a real bloodbath ? against the Vietcong - after the war . I do not sit in the inner councils of the NLF . I do not know the number of Vietnamese who may be victimized once US forces are withdrawn , But I am not persuaded that a bloodbath would take place if there were no US troops in Vietnam , or if the Vietcong took over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Vietnamese might be killed in the post-withdrawal period , it is the moral duty of the American people and government to find the way to protect them . In the past , the Chinese invaders always took along with them those Vietnamese who cooperated with them , and provided them with good jobs in China . The French have also been hospitable to their Vietnamese friends . If fears of reprisals are the main concern of the Administration , as President Nixon has indicated , then several steps can be taken . IP- Adopt Senator Charles E. Goodell 's " Vietnam Disengagement Act . " This would not only put a limit on the US commitment in Vietnam , but would create " a powerful incentive for that government of South Vietnaml to mobilize its forces more effectively and to seek the political strength of a broadened popularbase , " thus reducing the chance of wholesale reprisals . Po . Support Senator George McGovern 's suggestion and provide funds and means to resettle , either in continental America or in Hawaii , those Vietnamese who wish to leave the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congressional committee could be formed promptly to prepare evacuation plans . Journalists , politicians and others who have expressed concern about a possible bloodbath could be invited to contribute money and effort . The US can argue at the Paris talks ( or better , at a reconvened Geneva Conference ) for a period of regroupment exceeding the 309 days stipulated in the . t954 Geneva Agreements . As a resident of the US , being taxed without being represented , I would suggest that the US should ask its allies to share the burden . Perhaps some Vietnamese would like to settle in Thailand , in the Philippines , in South Korea , in New Zealand . Australia needs manpower , and if Canberra can send troops to fight for the " freedom " of the Vietnamese , the Australian Parliament can change its immigration laws to admit the colored Vietnamese . PA Give to the International Control Commission ( ICC ) temporary command of the last batch of US troops being withdrawn , thus guarding against their being assaulted by ARVN , NLF or Hanoi forces . 11 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 4C of the 1954 Geneva Accords . 14C said that the parties to the agreement undertook " to refrain from any reprisals or discrimination against persons or organizations on account of their activities during the hostilities , and to guarantee their democratic liberties . " These pledges are accepted in paragraph C of point 5 of the NLF .10-point program for the settlement of the war ,
