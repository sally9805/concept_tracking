ADVENTURES of the MIND The Universe . By D. E. HARDING F. avery age has its world-picture , its taken-for-granted view of the universe and man 's place in it . Ours is sup- posed to be based on science , and no longer on religion or superstition . But is it really the growth of science which has made a cosmology like Plato 's or Shakespeare 's incredible , and our own the only possible one ? Is our modern , educated layman 's estimate of the universe really founded on facts , or on prejudice ? It is certainly unlike the old estimate . Men once used to think of the universe as full of life , of the sun and stars and even the earth as visible deities , and of the blue sky as the country of the blessed . Priests and astronomers pointed up to the same encircling heavens , to celestial realms whose divinity was proportional to their distance from man at their center . Physical height matched spiritual status . All of this has now , we imagine , been finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have a centerless one , a cosmic potato instead of a cosmic onion . Instead of an aristocratic universe , we have a leveled-down one , whose principalities and powers have long ago lost all their influence . Instead of awesome star gods looking down on us , we have so many celestial firecrackers or blast furnaces blazing away in the night sky . Instead of a tremendously alive universe , we have an inanimate one in which sentient beings , lost like the finest of needles in the vastest of haystacks , manage to scrape a brief living . Instead of a meaningful creation  --  a proper place for man  --  we have a vast expanse of mindless space in which living things are the rarest accidents , or anomalies . And , in the last resort , even they are accidental collocations of particles . Such , more or less , is the new world-myth . Roughly speaking , this is how most of us educated nonscientists regard the universe . And we are under the impression that science makes any other view impossible . Does it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relegated man to an insignificant place in " a vast expanse of mindless space " ? First let us note that , truly speaking , there is nothing about the universe which forbids our taking this earth  --  or the sun , or any other convenient spot  --  as its center . On the contrary , we have only to use our eyes to see that the universe is always arranged as a nest of concentric regions  --  occupied by such things as pipe bowls and spectacle rims , hands and feet , men and animals , clouds and aircraft , moon and sun and stars  --  around the ever-central observer . To discount altogether this eminently verifiable fact , in favor of some theory  --  however useful  --  of uniform space , is unrealistic . In practice , the dead and centerless cosmic potato is found to he a cosmic onion , whose observer-core is the very focus of life and mind . Nor are the outer layers of this onionlike universe necessarily without life . True , we have direct evidence of only one inhabited heavenly body  --  our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a significant proportion of the stars are likely to have developed into solar systems resembling ours , and again a significant proportion of these systems are likely to contain planets which are suitable homes for the living . And where the right conditions arise  --  the right ingrediI ents and temperatures  --  there , scientists assure us , life will follow , Consequently , the number and variety of inhabited worlds may well beggar imagination . At any rate , then , we have better reason than Shakespeare for feeling , on starlit nights , that we are looking up into heavens well-sprinkled with life , some of it far surpassing our own . And the chances are that , to find the more superhuman of these inhabited worlds , we should need to probe farther and farther afield from our earth-center . For the realm of the nine planets plainly holds less promise than the remoter realm of the stars  --  the hundreds of millions of stars of our own Galaxy  --  containing who knows how many earth-encircled suns . Nor is this realm a millionth part so rich in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with its unthinkably great star population . Thus science itself not only hints at the existence of the superhuman but links it with distance from ourselves . We are even warned that the more exalted of the worlds above could be influencing us all the while in unsuspected ways  --  say by telepathy : the laboratory evidence for this faculty is impressive and , apparently , distance is no bar to its operation . In short , we are already back to something like the ancient world-picture , which science was supposed to have destroyed once and for all ! Clearly , then , we laymen can hardly claim the support of science for our pseudoscientific world-picture . But consistency is not our strong point . For instance , we talk as if it were somehow to our discredit that our universe home is on so splendid a scale , and as if we had lost and not found ourselves in it . We think of ourselves as mere pin points in the universe , as if our inability to weigh more than one or two hundred pounds apiece were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stars . Again , we speak of this " vast expanse of mindless space " as if it were anything but our life 's source , saturated with and saturating our own mind if no other . We are urged to fight nature , as if we packed a secret supernatural weapon . As for the human self-portrait as an " accidental collocation of particles , " and one moreover that walks around blandly describing itself as such  --  now there 's a delightful spectacle ! If this is a sample of what our idiotic universe can throw off accidentally ( whatever that can mean ) , think of what it could do if ever it got around , by some particularly happy accident , to doing it intentionally ! And , in fact , we do n't have to go far to find intention in what it does . It does us , who are full of intention . At any rate , a certain part of the universe called " I " intends itself , and a good deal besides . And so , presumably , does every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the point of suicide , How this universe can be so steeped in intention , yet remain merely accidental , we do not explain . Evidently we science-invoking moderns think of " living matter " as if it were somehow freakish , irrelevant to the nature of the universe . Yet science says that the physical basis of inert objects like heavenly bodies is the same as that of the creatures which come to life in them , formed of their substance . The difference does not lie in the raw material , but its organization . Thus the lowliest particles everywhere are capable of assuming the highest living forms . Potentially , all the stuff of all the stars is alive , purposeful and , indeed , superhuman . And even if such exalted functions could actually emerge only for a moment in only one spot , they would still reveal for all time the hidden nature of all matter . One small flower is enough to identify the biggest plant . It follows that there is no sense whatever in our description of the universe as lifeless and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tricks us . We are not deceived when we consider a creature of handy size ; for then we take its whole life history into account , and especially the more developed stages . Thus the plant is a flowering plant , even as a seedling ; and the caterpillar is no mere worm , but a moth in the making , even if it should never come out in its true colors . Flower seeds , mosquito larvae , human embryos : the higher functions are always the most significant for us  --  provided our specimen weighs no more than a few hundred tons and survives no more than a few hundred years ! Our unhappy cosmos lacks both qualifications . Its scale is wrong ; therefore its higher functions tell us nothing important about it ; we see it as defunct , and only infested with life ! No matter what myriads of living worlds and species and individuals our universe-tree may sport , no matter how luxuriant its blossoms of mind and values ( all arising naturally , science assures us ) , we still reckon it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ; it is not even a branching vase in which we , mere cut flowers , are tastefully displayed , but merely their indifferent or threatening background ! Thus , idiotically , do we human flowers deny the life of our cosmic plant because it is not all flower , but enormous leaves and stem and root , also ! The analogy is a false one . It does not go half far enough . A rose plucked from the bush is still a rose , but a man plucked from the universe is an absurdity . Yet this absurdity is the very core of our modern myth , which sees man as the clue to what the universe is nor like ! To say the least , then , the ancient notion of a living cosmos is neither ridiculous nor inconsistent with science . But whatever we think of the universe as a whole , we feel quite sure that its bigger parts are not alive . The bulkiest organisms we recognize are the big trees of California and Oregon and the blue whale . This is rather odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atoms and molecules and cells up to man who includes them all , a well-filled scale or hierarchy of unitary beings ; and then , immeasurably above man , the living whole . Why this cosmic gap ? If the vast interval between man and his minutest particles is filled by a series of increasingly subhuman parts , surely the principle of nature 's continuity suggests that the equally vast interval between man and the totality may be filled by a series of increasingly superhuman wholes . If these have so far escaped our notice , could that be because we have eyes only for our equals in the cosmic hierarchy ? Have weever looked for our superiors ' ! Would we recognize them if we saw them ? It is notoriously difficult to find a thing one has no idea of . Therefore let us assume that this gap in the natural order is not empty . Let us posit a creature who outbulks a man as a man outbulks a cell , and ask how such a giant would have to differ from ourselves in order to live at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a terrestrial organism . If it is too big it is unlikely to survive . In that case , we can only assume that our giant takes flight from his parent heavenly body and sets up as a heavenly body on his own account . Then he not only can be very massive , but needs to be ; otherwise , he can neither incorporate his own atmosphere and water supply , nor keep a firm gravitational hold upon them ; and without water and oxygen , and atmosphere shells to shield him from meteorites and dangerous radiation and extreme temperatures , he can not make the heavens his home . And once there , he can not just wander at will , but must attach himself to some star for warmth and energy , keeping a safe distance and turning continually to avoid freezing behind and roasting in front . And he is certainly a lucky giant . As soon as he starts spinning and circling round his star , the laws of gravity and inertia see that he goes on doing so without effort or deviation . As for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms , hands or feet , or even wings ? Nose and tongue and eats , a mouth and rows of teeth , a stomach and bowels and an anus  --  anything like these would surely be an encumbrance and a laughingstock in the heavens . We are left , apparently , with some vast rounded body , its whole surface drinking in solar energy . And supposing there were no convenient star to feed on ? Welt , if he can not 75 find what he needs , he must be it . Our starless sky dweller must himself incorporate a starlike source of energy  --  a great blazing heart to sustain the smaller and cooler peripheral body we have described . To sum up : if we greatly enlarge the creatures we know , adjusting their physique and behavior to suit their size , we get creatures that are indistinguishable from planets and stars . If they exist , they are probably a familiar sight . Many a star shining in the sky could in fact be a living thing , a fit inhabitant of heaven . And so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The seeming gap could arise from a defect of vision instead of a defect in the universe . A celestial detective story with no solution ! Perhaps it is time we came down to earth again , to the life we know . But do we know it ? A living thing ( scientists tell us ) is an organization of nonliving ones . The salts of our blood . the acid of our stomachs , and the calcium phosphate of our bones are clearly not alive ; but neither are the atoms comprising all our living cells . What is physics or chemistry at one observational level is a man at another , and at once alive and not alive . All depends on whether this thing is taken to pieces or not . But if the pieces ( as pieces ) are lifeless , where shall we set the boundaries of the living whole ? If by the whole man we mean one who is independent and self-contained . we can hardly leave out the air in his lungs and the saliva in his mouth and the chyme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out where these cease to be environment and become organism . And if they are caught up in the living whole of him , why not the tools without which he would starve to death and the clothes without which he would freeze to death ? After all he is far more dependent upon his shoes than his toenails , and upon his good false teeth than his bad real ones . They have become part of his life . That is how he describes them , and that is what they feel like . He identifies himself with his possessions and is not himself without them . He may be more vain of his facade than his face , and more hurt by the loss of a few tiles than many hairs . Until he feels so all-of-a-piece with the clothes he wears , and the horse he rides , and the financial or political power he wields , that they no longer seem outside him , he has still to learn their use . The expert is one who , having incorporated his tools , is unaware of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't sit on the seat of his pants , or even on a seat in a boat that sails on the sea . He sails , he is at sea . He does n't grasp a handle that holds a blade that cuts bread . He cuts bread . That is how a man speaks because that is what he is  --  an endlessly elastic organization of " dead " parts , mostly outside his skin . Thanks to them , he can drink at the lake and browse in the field while attending a concert on the far side of the world  --  all without setting foot outside his own porch . Instead of going out to these places , he grows out to them . Nor do these artificial but vital extensions complete his physique . To cut man off from the other creatures is homicidal , for species neither occur nor survive nor develop as things apart , but in great interlocking patterns of mutual dependence . Just as our muscle cells make no sense without our blood cells , so the bee 's tongue makes no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indefinitely  --  the more you study one bit of life the more you must take the others into account , so that really to know one would be to know the lot . If , then , we seek the living whole  --  and life , we have seen , is a question of wholeness  --  nothing short of the entire network of terrestrial organisms , growing up as one living thing from the start , really deserves such a title . And even this vast spherical organization is not yet a complete organism . This living earth-skin is still far from being self-contained  --  for without rock and water and topsoil and air it is as dead as the least of its parts . In short , nothing less than the whole Earth is genuinely alive ! Here indeed is a visible god or goddess . The giant we were seeking in the heavens was down here all the while ! ; nose life is in doubt ? Hers , or ours which is hers or nothing ? The only complete living thing of which we have inside knowledge turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the only heavenly body of which we have inside knowledge turns out to be a living thing  --  again , our Earth . In fact , it is not living heavenly bodies which call for proof , so much as dead ones ! The behavior and build of such a creature are so odd that we need a new word for this high-level vitality , this superlife which is at least planetary . Oddity , however , must be expected here , The living cell is a very different story from one of its molecules , and man from one of his cells . It would be strange if the living Earth were not , in turn , unlike her animal and subanimal parts . All the same , the Earth is no foreign body , living some mysterious life apart from ours . Admittedly her life-preserving maneuvers in the sky are less varied than ours in her ; but if to act deliberately is to know with scientific precision what you do and why ( its causes and effects in the past , present and future ) then her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Admittedly her beginnings were unconscious and unpromising , but so were ours ; and now who can match her adult complexity  --  all her own unfolding and no invasion ? For parent , she has the sun ; for anxiously awaited offspring , manned spaceships and satellites ; for eyes , observatories whose binocular vision ( like the merely human ) enables her to place her nearer neighbors ; for special sense organs , receptors tuned in to cosmic influences ; for intellectual exercise , our science of the heavens . We hang her portrait on our wails , and the close-up of her face is familiar to every radio-equipped aviator as a luminous and noisy and ever-changing network and patchwork . This is indeed no alien godling . She is the full extent , the filled-out body-mind of each of her creatures . For there is nowhere to live but heaven , and no way to live there but hers . But , of course , even she is not really suited to the hard climate of the skies . The smallest complete creature fit for this universe is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun , a solar system whose " living " planet is a mere organ . And even such a star is not independent of its fellows in our Galaxy , and of the universe of galaxies itself . Only the whole is a genuine whole , and therefore altogether alive . It is no surprise to find in the superhuman just such a hierarchy of wholes and parts as we found in the subhuman . Is n't this exactly what we wanted to fill the gap above man , and balance the orders below him  --  this ascending ; scale of beings  --  planetary , sidereal , and galactic , but all finite  --  in which higher rank means more independence achieved , and more " dead " material raised to life ? And is n't the life of man the indivisible life of the entire hierarchy  --  the upper half that he is in as well as the lower half that is in him  --  or nothing at all ? Is this view of man too speculative ? Then let us imitate the scientist , whose business is unprejudiced observation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control ) , Let us try observing man . What precisely arc you , when examined without prejudice ? What we make of you depends upon range . At ten feet , we see a human body ; a little closer , a head . But the superficial view is not enough . Our instruments take us nearer and nearer , to places where we observe tissues , cell groups , a cell in detail , giant molecules and so on . So much for the near view . Let us now move away from you . This time we find , in turn , a house , a city , a country , a planet , a star lour solar system ) and a galaxy . You may say that these are nothing like " you . " But which appearance is less like " you , " your particles or your planet , your cells or your city ? If the first is " you " observed , why not the second ? But we do n't yet know what " you " are , We can only take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creatures from particles to heavenly bodies . And this confirms our conclusion that you are incomplete , not yourself , tilt you are celestially constituted . You may reasonably protest that the distant view includes so much that is n't you , provided you add that the near view excludes so much that is you , and that the middle view is altogether too superficial . But all three objections beg the question : what are you ? Surely the best hope of an answer is to ignore no view of this object , whatever the range , Only unprejudiced observation could reveal the astonishing totality , with all its metamorphoses . You might reply that this merging and emerging , this cosmic elasticity , however true of your bodily or outer aspect , is untrue of your " real self . " To find out the truth , first listen to your self . You talk of this organ , this body , this house , city , country , planet and star . Clearly , what is felt as here varies from this aching tooth to this star , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other teeth in your head to all the other stars in the sky . " Now " and " then , " " fast " and " stow , " " present " and " absent " ? these little words are always giving you away . Anyone who can seriously talk of near galaxies yet the far side of the room , of old men in a new world , of giant atoms in it dwarf star , is either altogether elastic or beside himself . Far from deceiving us , language is only underlining the facts . A diseased mind may so identify itself with one bodily organ that the rest are treated as alien or hostile . And evidently a man may so identify himself with his family , or country , or race , or planet fin the event of interplanetary war ) , or God , that he thinks for them , and is hurt when they are injured , and makes their good his good , and lives and dies for them without thought of his private welfare . In fact , anyone who lacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imbecile , incapable of objectivity or responsibility . The idea of the self as constant , as a unique , permanent , separate , immiscible something , will not bear examination . The facts make nonsense of it  --  they include the evidence of multiple personality , religious conversion , amnesia and parapsychology , not to mention the great problem of biological individuality . Nor does this nonsensical idea work . Quite the contrary , it is madness . To the extent that we cut ourselves off from anybody and everybody we are out of our minds and dispirited . The truth is that this illusion of a separate self and the illusion of a dead universe are halves of a whole , segments of one vicious circle . The universe seems dead because I seem out of it . l seem out of it because the universe seems dead . Till the total mind in man rejoins its own total body , the universe , he is self-alienated and the universe appears corpselike . Short of that goal , his elastic mind matches his elastic body ; here and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of object ; you and I are roughly equals . It is a man who greets a man , a ship that hails a ship , a planet that signals a planet . And just as it is not this eye ( or even this head ) that sees you , but this man ( from top to toe ) who does so , so it is not this man who studies Mars , but Earth that does so . She is our only astronomer  --  no mere man being equal to or equipped for the task  --  so that , in fact , there is the world of difference between the " I " in " I see a man " and in " I see Mars . " Again , when the general ( note the noun ) says he will smash the enemy , it is the army that does so . And when the atomic physicist ( note the adjective ) says he will smash the uranium nucleus , it is neutrons that do so . Yet he does not feel small , any more than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally to us to be almost everything , and the next moment almost nothing , that we never notice the transformation . We have every right , then , to announce Earth 's life . It is an aspect of our own infinitely elastic life . But this makes her peculiarly vulnerable . A word is enough to kill this great but sensitive creature . For we have only to decide , in the teeth of all the evidence , that she shall be a " lifeless " planet , and then no matter what limb she flourishes , or eye she opens , or Song of the Earth she sings  --  nothing she can ever door say will prove her alive : because it is all , by definition , not hers ! It is living , and therefore alien or parasitic ! Never shall the life on Earth be the life of Earth , Treat a man thus , and he is little more than a cell-infested skeleton . Examine the world 's liveliest organism till you know it inside out , and you will find nothing but cell-populated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to rank as geological specimens instead of anti-geological ones , is to stop geologizing , and thinking , and living , and get ourselves buried and petrified . Then we are dead enough to belong again ! And , of course , our sun  --  now come to life as our solar system  --  gets the same raw deal . We have only to hand over the whole of his natural history to physics and astronomy ( as if his men and beasts were unnatural and his flowers artificial ) to reduce this star god to star dust . A solar myth as curious as this does not spring up overnight . It , too , has a natural history . To our early ancestors the sun was simply alive , as you or I , only brighter and more divine . But gradually the animating spirit was distinguished and divided from the gross body , which became a mere fireball steered by an independent god or angel . Then science reduced particular star spirits to general laws of nature , tendencies and forces . And eventually , coming down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen as man-made or subjective , and so exorcised . The stars are no longer impelled or guided in their courses . They only take the line of least resistance . And while the solar life and mind are thus being wiped out , the body itself is being quietly disposed of . The sun 's sensible qualities  --  his color , brightness , warmth  --  are drawn in from the object there to the subject here , to the eye of the perceiver . Even his apparent motion across the sky is really ours . Finally , and just in case any miserable residue of our victim should remain , physics dissolves his substance into space , dotted with inscrutable particles . Here is the murder story of all time  --  nothing less than " cosmicide " committed over millenniums. and still going practically undetected Fortunately , however , it is only a talc , a piece of solar crime fiction . For we could gel rid of the solar life by absorbing it into Cu , heads only if they were lethal receptacles , or else made off with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the life of our solar system has suffered an internal shift ; it has not vanished . Rather the reverse . Doubtless it is only by thus shamming dead that a planet-ringed sun can wake in the end to a fully self-conscious life , After all , our pseudoscientific myth of a dead sun must be seen as a solar rather than a merely human myth , as an indispensable chapter in the natural history of our solar system rather than a mere aberration . Only do n't let us mistake this brief and somewhat crazy chapter for the whole story . And do n't let us mistake indifference to this story for real neutrality . The universe which is not seen as living is treated as dead . There is no halfway . Even if we could avoid taking sides , rejection of the ancient world-view amounts in practice to acceptance of the modern , with its immense consequences for religion and art and politics , to say nothing of science itself . To sum up : we have found our modem myth , this life-abhorring world-picture that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort . Instead , we have found science pointing in the opposite direction , toward something like the old cosmic hierarchy culminating in the divine . The outcome for you and me is as far-reaching as we care to make it . Already we have seen that , once we breach the artificial wall dividing our little selvesfrom the hierarchy of our greater selves , the walls are apt to go on falling , till in the end we glimpse the one self of all . I t is the first step that counts . Once we admit any life and mind above the merely human , we are apt to find ourselves admitting more and more , till we come to the highest life , our total mind , where we are safe home at last and outside nothing . That is where , say the world 's great spiritual teachers , we could even now lose ourselves for good , in a deathless world whose divisions and opacity have finally vanished , and where everything is indescribably open , weightless and brilliant . To some of us , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves to the death . To others , here is a renewed invitation to the toughest adventure of all , whose end is variously called enlightenment , liberation , the Kingdom of Heaven and the mystical union . Several roads lead toward that goal ; and the road whose first stages this article has sketched is certainly not everybody 's . To the thoroughly Westernized mind , however , whose preoccupation has for two centuries been the " conquest " of nature , this approach may have more than intellectual interest . Nature , the " enemy , " can now show us her kinder face . She can lead us farther than ever before toward the one unchanging reality of which she is the manifold and fleeting appearance . In any case , there exists for none of us , not even the most " spiritual , " a merely human or personal liberation which leaves nature out , and which does not77 involve the liberation of every creature on the Earth and in the skies , however grotesque or seemingly unlovable . How could we begin to disentangle ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all live and move and have our being ? Enlightenment is either cosmic or nothing .

She died last year . " " Oh . Well , what about your dad ? " " He 's working . He wo n't even know I 'm not on the bus . I 'm supposed to meet him at home . " The boy was silent for a moment .

" " Sure , " the man said , dimly aware that he had no intention of turning the boy in . " How many miles have you gone so far ? " " About thirty . A farmer gave me a ride , and I walked a lot . " The man drove silently . At the outskirts of Dalesburg he pulled over and parked . " I 'll let you off here , " he said . " Do you have eating money ? " Tommy nodded , He dug into his shirt pocket and showed a quarter . The man added a dollar bill to the lonesome coin and closed the boy 's fist around it as he started to protest .

" Do n't say you 're going as far as New York . Just say you 're visiting an aunt down the road . And turn that camp shirt inside out . Ws a dead giveaway . " The boy struggled obediently out of his uniform , ribs showing against smooth , hairless skin . " Maybe , " the man said slowly , " I 'm not doing you any favor . Maybe you 'd he better off if the cops did pick you up . " Tommy looked horrified . " That would spoil everything . Ca n't you see how terrible that would be ? " The driver studied the boy 's high , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Then they said good-by and shook hands , and the man tried not to notice how small the boy 's fingers felt in his . Tommy Neatly stood watching the truck roar away and suddenly felt alone and a little frightened . He had not thought about the police before . Then he put on his war bonnet , looped the tail over one arm and started to walk once more . The sun was almost directly overhead , and no breeze ruffled the feathers as he walked . After a while his arm began to tire and he carefully transferred the looped tail to the other arm . How much easier , he thought , to just let it trail behind him . But the feathers would become nicked and dirty , and this was not the way he wanted his father to see them , They must be bright and clean and shining  --  the way the feathers of the old , the other , war bonnet had been . Then everything would be just as he had planned . He let his thoughts slip into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For in his mind it was always the same , with even the words clearly worked out . " It 's beautiful ! " his father would exclaim . " Did you really make it yourself ? " And he , Tommy Neally , would smile and nod . Then his father would walk around him so as not to miss anything . When he was through , he would grin and say quietly , " I think I 'm going to love it even more than the old war bonnet . " He would say nothing more . But they would both know all it meant , all that would be changed . His father might even put his arms around him and kiss him because he was so happy . And Tommy thought that he surely loved his father very much . Tommy pulled from his hip pocket a small snapshot , cracked and faded in its worn-leather holder . He stopped to study it and saw himself standing eight years tall in the war bonnet , held wondrously and forever between his mother and father in a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just bought the bonnet , and Chief Dark Cloud himself had snapped the picture for them in front of the Reservation Trading Post .

But how long ago that had been , Tommy thought , walking on . Now his father did not grin at all any more  --  not since his mother had died . Now his father just sat sometimes and did not say anything . And even when his father did speak to him , it was as though he did not really know that he was there .
