Apart from worrying over whether his dashboard clock will tick too loudly , the Rolls-Royce owner has one big concern : Should he entrust his car to just any parking attendant when he goes out to dine ? In Hollywood last week , Rolls-Royce owners rejoiced over the news that this had ceased to be a problem . A new restaurant , the Fairchild , opened on La Cienega Boulevard 's restaurant row , with two collegiate parking attendants , one of whom handles just any old American car , the other babies the foreign jobs , especially the Rollses . In fact , the fellow fits covered , foam-rubber pads on the bumpers before he gets behind the wheel ( Rolls owners may buy a pair of the pads at $75 ) . And since it would never do to leave a pet inside a Rolls during dinner , Restaurateur Peter Fairchild also provides three dog kennels fitted with drains and red fire hydrant , and offers " succulent ground sirloin that will be served gratuitously by our attendant .
