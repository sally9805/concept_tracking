His face is like a side of cheese the maggots have been at , but his eyes are bright and piercing . " Hollow cheeks , strong jaw , jutting cheekbones , a large voracious mouth , a living heart , a great brute soul not yet severed from Mother Earth " - this is Zorba the Greek . He strides up to a young man he has never seen before and looks deep into his eves . " I like you , " he announces fiercely . " Take me with you . " <P> " Why ? " the young man answers with a gasp . He is a timid essayist who takes refuge from life in literature . <P> " Why ! " the old man roars with exasperation . " Will no man ever do anything without a reason ?

" <P> The young man does n't have to look far . The morning after his first night with the widow , she is grotesquely murdered by the vengeful villagers . Some clays later , as Zorba 's silly old slut lies dying , bestial peasants burst into her house and strip it while she lies weakly watching , strip it to the walls and leave her there alone with nothing but a bed to die on .
