Tomorrow is Sunday and many people may wish to go to the isola . " " But , " I protested , " if many people wish to go on Sunday , / do not wish to go . I will go on Monday . " This childishness he smiled aside , tolerant , gentle , and unmoved . " It is best , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many people . For Sunday at one o'clock . " " For four , " I added meekly . " For four  --  Sunday at one . The be waiting at eleven . " He wrote it he spoke ; and that was settled . On Sunday morning the launch was waiting at the stone steps down to Lake Como , made fast , bow and stern , to wooden piles gay in their red and yellow corkscrew stripes . A touch of gaiety was not a bad thing , I thought , as I handed my companion down the steps to the boatman , who stood steadying the craft , holding an umbrella against a rain squall and offering a hand to the lady with solemn and imperturbable courtesy . " E nulla , Signora , " he murmured , waving aside the low scudding clouds which shut off the opposite shore ; then , closing us in the minute cabin , he shoved off . His confidence was contagious . Though he sat in the open , driving thelaunch into a blinding squall with the rain running off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that the course was set for luncheon for four on the terrace of the isola . And so it was . In the short hour 's run up the lake to pick up our friends , the sun was out , tearing the clouds apart ; and Italy was looking as only Italy , drying her eyes , can look . Our friends were waving on the quay . In a moment they were aboard ; the top of the cabin was rolled back ; we headed for our island , while the boatman steamed gently in the October sun . " It was there , " said our friend , pointing , " right beside that white church hallway up the hill that Mussolini and his mistress were shot . " The sun lost its warmth . That world had no place in this Sunday morning . No one spoke . Then everyone did ; but not about the white church halfway up the hill , In a moment we had rounded a point and it was Iost to sight . O U R friends had bought a villa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them there , our car wound up a steep road built for donkeys and cattle to a village of stone and stucco . In its center the road widened a bit before an arched carriage entrance on the left , set in solid masonry and closed by massive wooden doors . At the sound of our horn they swung wide to 79 let us into what had been the stable and now opened onto a colonnade along the front of the house . We emerged from its cool dimness  --  and caught our breath . Far below , beyond the treetops and roofs along the terraces through which we had climbed , lay the lake , flashing back the dazzling sunlight with , here and there , dark shadows on its surface from the few clouds still left . We stood there looking . " Do you ever become so used to this that you look without seeing ? " I asked . " No , " she said , " never . But still I like to go down the hill , because coming hack this first look always stops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . " The villa was stone even to its marble floors and stairs , the new part eighteenth-century , the rest centuries older . No one knew when the terraced garden with its exotic trees and shrubs had been laid out . The gardener had cared for it all his life . When the former owner died . he readily got another job but asked to be allowed to stay on with his family over the stable , so that he could tend his beloved garden until someone else came to do it . Now he was back full-time , ecstatically happy , and teaching his son how to work with the earth and nature . When my host told me this , it brought hack a remark of Harold Nicolson 's : That people thought of statesmen as architects drawing on blank sheets plans for structures to be ; but in fact they should he thought of as gardeners who must work with the earth as they find it and for whom achievement could come only by understanding and using the eternal processes of nature . How would it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more gardeners in public life ? Then I recalled that our host was a banker , turned diplomat , a rare combination , I used to tell him , of cold-blooded calculation . Would a gardener be a match for him in negotiation ? Or for an ex-coal miner turned dictator ? Perhaps lawyers had their usefulness , after alb T 0 MAKE talk while thoughts of the white church faded , I said , " You are good to leave your beautiful villa and try a Sunday lunch at the island . I hope it is not crowded . The hotel has made a reservation . " Our guest had never been there , she said , but she had heard that it was pleasant at the island and that one had a good meal . The boatman , who had been standing well offshore , turned into a strait about a hundred yards wide between a Former Secretary of State Dean Acheson , who has been practicing law in Washington since 1953 , occasionally writes or speaks on political and international affairs in tones that ring round the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for enjoyment . His last story in . " Harper 's " was " The Great Fish of Como. " small island and the shore . Then he cut the motor and drifted in for a landing . A raft made of a few logs with slats across them connected by a plank with the shore . Its buoyancy was low . To stand on it to help the ladies ashore would land them in ankle-deco water . So it became every woman for herself . with rescue wailing on the bank . Then a slow climb up the stone steps cut around the cliff to the restaurant forty feet above . We heard the chatter and laughter before our heads rose above the brick floor of the terrace . Some fifteen tables seating from two to eight  --  mostly families with children , a few lovers , alI Italian  --  were scattered about tip to the low wall beyond which lay the lake . There was no empty table . A few trees threw spotty shade . On a path leading to a slightly higher grassy knoll a few more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chased the dogs . The laughter seemed directed toward a large man standing in the center of the terrace . As we gained the level he turned ; rod greeted us . Here , one knew at once , was a notable character . He had the look of a paunchy satyr. blended with that of a middle-aged Dionysus without the heard . Black hair , curly and long . was thinning on top and receding . His eyes squinted in quizzical amusement . A long nose for knowing , and white teeth for smiling , were set in a plump ( but not fat ) South Italian face . His sports shirt opened at the neck , revealing a black bushiness ; an embroidered Greek waistcoat with brass buttons hung unbuttoned . Around his paunch was tied a red-and-white checked tablecloth , below which protruded black pantaloons and bare feet in wooden clogs . " A table , " said our guest in Italian , looking about doubtfully , " was reserved for the signore . " This produced a half-subdued roar from the proprietor . " Ali , Signora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , dress him up like a drum major , make a concierge of him , and he becomes all puffed up and makes a great fuss about nothing . A reservation , is it ? Who wants reservations ? You shall have your table , the best . " 80 THE GREEKS COME TO THE ISOLA He walked over to a shed by the side of a long , low , red-tiled brick building  --  which was evidently restaurant , kitchen , and house all in one  --  threw back a tarpaulin , and produced with a flourish a round wicker table in one hand and two chairs in the other . A shout produced a small replica of the proprietor , with a smaller tablecloth about his smaller waist , who brought two more chairs and a red-and-white checked tablecloth . " Your table , Signore , Signori . " He bowed us to our places and had the table set almost as we sat clown . At this point my companion took charge of matters . She is a lady of sophistication , who knows her way about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all very well within limits , could get out of hand and was already amusing our fellow lunchers . With that touch on the reins and tone of voice which has told many a spirited horse and some other mammals who was in command , she said , " May we have menus , please ? " For a moment not a sound , not a movement came from Dionysus . Then through the amazement registered on that mobile face dawned sympathetic understanding merging into the solemn , amused tolerance with which adults respond to children who are doing their best to act grown up . " Menus , " he said . Then , as though trying to put a difficult idea simply , " Menus are all very well in their place . To be sure , they can confuse the irresolute and embarrass those who do not know the dishes or the language . " A glint in her green-gray eyes led him to add hastily during the translation , " Neither of which , of course , applies to the signora . " But we have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I know food , the markets , andhow my wife , a good woman , cooks . I choose the meal . It is very good . My patrons like it ; see how happy these people are . " And , indeed , they were happy , if not hilarious . " So , " he ended , " enjoy yourselves , drink some wine , and , in a moment , you shall see . " T H E strife was over . Dionysus was in corn ? mand and we had joined in the rites . They began almost at once . A large bottle of local wine , and very fair it was , was soon followed by another ; then the hors d'oeuvres , largely unknown to me , except for the prosciutto , the paper-thin Italian barn wrapped around pieces of melon . After that came fish broiled over charcoal , skinned and filleted by Dionysus , and covered with lemon juice , herbs , and butter . After that , chicken broiled the same way , juicy and tender , served with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time my companion seemed to be falling behind the rest of us . Dionysus , who had been clattering about serving and talking to everyone , was onto it in a moment , standing at her side , peering anxiously at her plate . " Delicious , " she murmured , " hut you are too generous . " " Ali , no , Signora , it is not good for ladies to watch their figures . Nature intended that others should do this . " A satyrish glance indicated that this was by no means an unpleasurable occupation , and brought a slight blush . " To look like this ( sucking in his cheeks ) is not good for ladies , and makes them unkind to gentlemen . When the cheeks are full ( blowing them out ) , ladies smile more and everything goes better . Think of my wife when I say , ' Your best did not tempt the signora ' . " So there was nothing for it but finish the chicken and the salad and the wine . Things began to get complicated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it two bowls , one of sliced apples , the other of sliced pears . Over the apples Dionysus poured gin , over the pears , Cointreau . Innumerable lemons were squeezed over each , and lots of sugar . Finally apples and pears were well mixed . The result seemed food for gods  --  that is , gods who would like the island on a Sunday afternoon , not egghead gods like Athene or Apollo . A great . sense of well-being came over us as we waited for coffee and liqueurs . They came in an unexpected way . By skilled conducting , Dionysus had brought all his patrons to the concluding point at the same time , regardless of when they had begun . All were ready for their coffee . The boy , a solemn acolyte , placed on a table in the center of the terrace a large bowl resting in a frame containing a spirit lamp which he lighted and trimmed . Dionysus appeared with a number of bottles and some packages of sugar . As conversation died , the acolyte scurried back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowl , and carefully arranging the bottles as for a rite . The quiet deepened as we all strained to catch the opening words . " This is the time of year , " Dionysus began , gently touching his bottles , " for the harvest festival , as it was over two and a half thousand years ago in my Sicily , in those beautiful Greek temples we still have , built when Rome was a village and before there was even the little Etruscan temple to Demeter on the Aventine . Then it was that the rites were held to Demeter , the mother of all , to Ceres , who brought life and growth , and to him who had in special charge the vine which drives away the cares of man and smoothes his brow , Dionysus . " I would have sworn that at the last word he gave the merest suggestion of a bow . The rites began , " he went on , " with the bowl placed on the altar and filled , as it has been here . " From a table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't know that the Greeks had coffee . " " Ah , my friend , there is much that one does not know about the Greeks . One does not know , for instance , that they did not have coffee . But it matters little what liquid filled the bowl . Importance lay in what was added . To Demeter , greatest of all , the distillation of the grape . " The boy handed him a bottle of brandy , and in it went . " To Ceres , who cherished and nourished her children , the soothing and gentle white wine . " In went a bottle of Suave . " And to him who gives strength for gaiety and laughter and dancing when the day 's work is clone , the foaming red wine . " A bottle of Chianti . " For the god of each village and each field , the flavoring which they have given . " Cinnamon , cloves , and grated nutmeg . " Finally to honor all those , young and old , men and women , whose backs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grains of this sugar , I add it also . " " But , you are no agricoltore , " a voice came from behind me . " What do you harvest ? " He exploded with a burst of triumphant laughter . " My friend , my dear friend , I began to fear that I must talk all afternoon before one of you would help me by asking that . My harvest ? My harvest will be the lira , the beautiful lira , you will soon pay me . Is not that the most precious harvest ? To be sure , the rest of the world does not think much of our lira . But we Italians are true to it , so true that the less it is worth the more we want . " " Is n't it the truth ? " someone remarked amid the laughter , clapping , and bravos . The sacrificial coffee was served . The sun was dropping toward the hills . There was a general scraping of chairs . We moved toward the steps where the harvest was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ register , to the accompaniment of farewells and much joking . As my change was being retrieved from the bowl , I said quietly , " Addio , Dionysus dell'isola . " He looked up quickly . " The signore spoke ? " " Only to say thank you and good-by . " " Mile grazie , " he beamed . " Ma non addio , arrivederci ad un'altra volta . " Not good-by , so long , until another time .
