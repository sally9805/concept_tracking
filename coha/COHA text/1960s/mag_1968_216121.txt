Open up , speak out , controversy before caution , and the hell with the censors . That sums up the mood of TV 1968 , and it cuts across all phases of programming . <P> Until recently , controversy on TV was considered as offensive as dead air . Sponsors would not have it , and neither would the viewers - or so it was supposed . Only a few commentators with clout , including Edward R. Murrow and Eric Sevareid , could get away with expressing sharp personal opinion . And certainly nobody succeeded with blatantly risque humor . This past season , the Smothers Brothers , Rowan and Martin , and Johnny Carson , among others , have waged a deliberate campaign to get sex jokes past the censor - whom Carson sardonically calls " Miss Priscilla Goodbody . " But it is in the realm of serious discussion that television 's growing maturity really clears the air . " We no longer shut our eyes or shut off the facts , " savs CBS Censor William Tankersley . " The world is a madhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world . " <P> Battle of Talkathons . Much of TV 's comment and controversy are heard on the day-and-night conversation shows , which seem to be trying to turn TV into a talkathon . They frantically compete with each other for big-name , talkers . Joey Bishop interviews Ronald Reagan , Carson brings on Ayn Rand , Merv Griffin chats with Bertrand Russell . One night , Dick Cavett has Norman Mailer as his guest , the next night he leads a spirited discussion between James Bald win and Yale Philosopher Paul Weiss . <P> The talk shows aside , commentary is increasingly moving into straight news programs . ABC , in particular , recently revamped its news format to make room for more discussion and debate , interspersing its regular coverage with the broadcast equivalent of columns . Publisher Bill Moyers , former White House aide , recently went on camera to predict that the next President will be faced with " a national political nervous breakdown . " Critic Marya Mannes razzed fashion models who have " no visible sexual equipment . " Other commentaries have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> &gt; Newspaper Editor James Kilpatrick on the Poor People 's March : " All the visible ' poor ' at Resurrection City appear remarkably well-fed . Some are downright fat . Most are young , ablebodied . Every man jack of them could find a job in Washington-carrying a hod , if nothing else . But work ? Take jobs ? Earn a living ? Not this gang . " <P> &gt; Author Gore Vidal on actors in politics : " I made my contribution to the problem back in 1964 , when I was casting the movie The Best Man , which dealt with two men running for the presidency . I offered a part to Ronald Reagan , who said he was not interested in a small part but that he was interested in playing one of the candidates for President . I then sent back word that I did not think Ronald Reagan would be credible as a national candidate . So much for my gift of prophecy . "                  @ @ @
