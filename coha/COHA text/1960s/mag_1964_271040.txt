As soon as the curtain dropped on the performance of Bellini 's Norma , fist fights erupted , insults bounced be tween boxes , and the grandly helmeted Gardes Rpublicaines clanked into action . One bejeweled matron tore the glasses off a startled young man next to her ; another dug her fingernails into her adversary 's Balenciaga dcollet . Dress Designer Yves Saint Laurent dealt his neighbor a smart kick in the shins . Monaco 's Princess Grace , along with Charlie Chaplin , his wife and his brood , fled for the exits . Aristotle Onassis and Rudolf Bing stayed on to applaud . The tumult raged for a full 30 minutes . Then at 2 a.m. , the object of it all , Maria Callas , slipped out the stage door of the Paris Opera , ducked into her flower-strewn limousine , and purred off into the balmy Paris night . <P> Pro-and anti-Callas factions have been squaring off ever since the celebrated diva opened in Norma a month ago . But the big uproar began when at one performance she reached for a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Take her to the cloakroom ! " from the gallery . Despite the furor , Callas and Norma were judged a triumph by the Paris critics . WHO CARES ABOUT A LITTLE B-FLAT , headlined Paris Presse . This week , at the conclusion of Norma 's run , everyone agreed that Director Georges Auric , 65 , who was hired two years ago on his promise to " bring a breath of new life " to the Paris Opera , had delivered the most exciting season in recent memory . <P> Tourists Only . When Auric first took on the weighty title of Administrateur de la Runion des Thtres Lyriques Nationaux , he took on a ponderous load of problems as well ( TIME , April 27 , 1962 ) . Mired in a vast swamp of bureaucracy , militant unions and second-rate talent , the state-operated Paris Opera had foundered helplessly for nearly two decades . Five postwar administrators had promised revolution , only to sink quietly into the morass . Some tried staging productions la Folies-Bergre , featuring flights of ballerinas being hoisted to heaven on wires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spray guns hissed perfume into the audience . But the audiences hissed right back , and the Paris Opera , a towering rococo palace covering three acres right in the heart of the city , remained a flop . <P> Vowing to change all that in short order or else resign , Auric started boldly by scheduling Alban Berg 's fiercely modern Wozzeck . " If I am not able to mount this production , " he declared , " I will know that nothing can be done for the National Opera here . " He demanded an unprecedented 35 rehearsals , grappled successfully with eleven labor unions ( guardians of the Opera 's bloated staff of 1,100 , including 95 stagehands , 35 firemen , 32 electricians , 30 wardrobe mistresses ) , but still lacked funds for his crash program . <P> New Era . Undaunted , Auric , who lives in the shadow of the Elyses Palace , marched across the street to have a word with an influential neighbor-General Charles de Gaulle . " We understood each other perfectly , " says Auric , chomping on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General , I need money . ' Then I explained the situation , and everything went off very well .
