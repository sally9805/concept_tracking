Can schoolteachers win public support and higher pay by going on strike like miners and dockers ? <P> <P> " We will win ! " chanted 4,600 teachers as they hit the picket line last week in New York City . Circling 267 schools , they crippled junior highs , left students staring at blank blackboards in unattended classrooms ( surprisingly little disorder resulted ) . Cried happy kids : " Hold that line ! " The first teachers ' strike in the city 's history was called by the United Federation of Teachers , A.F.L.-C.I.O. , which claims one-quarter of the 39,000 teachers in the nation 's biggest urban public school system . The union had solid demands , from sick pay to duty-free lunch periods , but most of all it wanted collective bargaining rights . Therein lay the real issue . As one of 39 organizations representing New York teachers , the union sought to become the strongest . <P> The strike was illegal under New York State 's never-used Condon-Wadlin Act , which outlaws strikes by public employees on pain of dismissal . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead suspended the strikers . Then Mayor Robert F. Wagner called in three top labor leaders , including the Garment Workers ' Dave Dubinsky , to " mediate . " Said one : " We pledge to the families of New York City that there will be no recurrence . " <P> <P> The strike lasted just one day . Theobald guaranteed no reprisals , but leaders of the teachers ' union rumbled that the end was only " an honorable truce . " Whether prelude or epilogue , the strike was a classic example of the dilemma facing U.S. teachers . To get needed gains in pay and treatment , they now have two rival organizations : the noncombative , 714,000-member National Education Association , which is mostly dominated by school administrators , and the aggressive , 60,000-member American Federation of Teachers , A.F.L.-C.I.O . As proved in New York last week , national labor chieftains-sensing the unpopularity of strikes that can be described as " against the children " - are not much interested in supporting teachers . What U.S. teachers really need is an overall professional organization to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
