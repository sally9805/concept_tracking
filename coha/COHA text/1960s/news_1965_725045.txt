txt Mongolia : $100 a day Travel editor of The Christian Science Monitor Ulan Bator , Mongolia This probably is the most expensive land in the world for tourists ? $100 a day per nerson for about an eieht-day stay . This amount of time is necessary to justify ? if justification can be made for coming here  --  the staggering amount of money such a trip will cost . A 2,000-dollar bill , if there were such a thing , would have a whoppirig big dent in it when you left . For $1,600 , perhaps a bit more , two people would get hotel accommodations , three meals a day with some mare 's milk on the side , transportation to Terelj for an overnight stay in a yurt , a visit to Sugungur where there is a large cooperative farm , city sight-seeing , and a two-day trip to the South Gobi ( desert ) . Why is it so expensive ? Because it is extremely costly for Mongolia to provide Western tourists with the bare essentials necessary for reasonable comfort , guides , food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only three years ago , does not encourage individuals or even couples to come . It can do much better with groups for it does not have the English-speaking guides to take care of many separate parties . Also , group travel is less expensive . As the tourist industry grows here  --  and the Mongolians appear to want it badly  --  prices may come down . But not substantially for several years . What appeal does the Mongolian People 's Republic have for the tourist ? Primarily , the appeal is that Communist Mongolia is one of the last tourist outposts before stepping into Communist China , something an American can not do . Mongolia , to say the least , differs greatly from the Soviet Union although politically // // it is closely allied with Moscow . The people are , for the most part , spontaneously friendly and those in the hotel make every effort to please . This is strikingly and touchingly noticed , especially after some of the indifference experienced in Moscow . Every visitor here will immediately fall in love with the little ruby-checked girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiles . Their long , black hair hangs in twin or single tightly woven braids , decorated with crisp bows of varied colors . Flash a smile at these youngsters and your reward will be a sunburst of radiance . J. The Hotel Ulan Bator is surprisingly good , much better than any Moscow or Leningrad hotel I ever stayed in . Hot water is not always available , but generally speaking the hotel is comfortable , if not always the cleanest . Meals can become monotonous , with the same fare day after day . The dining room serves a few local dishes but attempts are made to prepare a meal Westbrners would like . For example , a breakfast consists of cucumbers , sliced tomatoes , cole slaw , tongue , dark bread , sardines , and perhaps an egg that has been boiled less than a minute ! Tea is by far the best hot drink . A noon meal starts off with the same side dishes as at breakfast , followed by a good soup , beef , and potatoes . Dinner would be the same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it got few takers . There is n't very much of tourist interest in this capital city , other than the people themselves and the children . City and environs have a population of 225,000 but you 'd hardly know it from the relatively few people you see on the broad streets . In addition to seeing several embassies ? those of other Eastern countries ? you 'll be shown elementary schools , the university , a Lama temple , the large central square , the department store ( its cupboards almost bare ) , and the museum . The museum contains exhibits of animal life indigenous to the coun-. try , minerals , precious stones , and the skeleton of a dinosaur . There are two statues of Joseph Stalin but they are not called to your attention . This about wraps up a sightseeing tour of Ulan Bator . There is considerable building going on here ; primarily apartment houses . Both the Soviets and the Chinese Communists are aiding Mongolia in these projects . Our guide is very proud of the new state-built apartments . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was outwardly disturbed . He insisted I should do so in order " to show my people the wonderful new buildings in Mongolia . " For shoppers there is little to buy ; most items are rather crude . The stamp collector , however , will have a field day here , for Mongolia issues a variety of stamps in interesting designs and colors . Many of the stamps are so large that they cover a good part of a post card , so it is best to put them on first before writing a message . Air mail for a post card to the United States costs the equivalent of about 15 cents . Many of the people still live on the outskirts of the capital in yurts , a circular-domed tent , with a smokestack sticking through the roof . From a distance they look like a group of oil-storage tanks . Colonies of these are tightly packed together and usually a board fence surrounds the little village . In the country the yurts are moved from place to place , these people being nomads . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yurt and will write a detailed description of the experience for this column . ? Ulan Bator is located at an elevation of 4,000 feet with a series of undulating , fuzzy-brown hills rising gently into higher ones cloaked with evergreens . The days at this time of the year are sunny and warm , but the nights can be freezing . Since we have been here , snow flurries during one day coated the hills with white . Americans must enter Mongolia through the Soviet Union . From Moscow there is air service to Ulan Bator , with some of the flights of Aeroflot , the Russian airline , stopping at Omsk and Irkutsk . The only three places where a visa may be obtained for Mongolia are Peking , New Delhi , and Moscow . It is essential that anyone wanting to come to this far-out country should make all arrangements through a reputable travel agent . My tour was sponsored by Afton Tours , Inc. , of New York , under the direction of Sonya Sokolow , a Russian-speaking American who coped with difficult and trying situations with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out well in advance . Without her along as a guide it is questionable whether we ever would have left Moscow , due to a last-minute discovery by Soviet officials that we were over our baggage allowance . To straighten this out took a half hour . We boarded our plane with only a minute to spare . To obtain the visa also can be a tedious task . An American will find it much easier to have a person familiar with the process obtain it . The average traveler would not realize that a re-entry visa is needed for the Soviet Union . But it is because when you return from Mongolia , you have to go through the U.S.S.R. a second time . A Mongolia visa costs $5.50 . English is spoken or understood by only a , very few in Mongolia . They do speak Russian , so here again it is most ' essential to have a guide ' along who knows the language . Mrs. Sokolow started as early as last February to organize this tour ; even though every detail was carefully planned , things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide can unravel the red tape and keep the tour on an even keel . We have run into several " unexpected " situations in which we would have found ourselves helpless had it not been for our guide 's know-how . Why visit Mongolia ? This question is n't easily answered , espeCially with the exorbitant costs involved . But does n't just the former name " Outer Mongolia " start those strings of adventure vibrating ? Does n't the thought of spending two nights in a yurt in the South Gobi excite your curiosity , even though you might expect there will be some discomfort ? Does n't the name of Genghis Khan , whose land this was , stir your imagination ? All of these things , I am sure , create at least a desire to know something about this mysterious land so close to Communist China .
