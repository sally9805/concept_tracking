He stood at the entrance to Roosevelt Memorial Hall , fronting on Central Park in New York City , while his mother pulled out a coin and dropped it into a contributions box .

Perhaps the visitor 's first surprise is the dis- covery that this is not a single building , but covery that this is not a single building , but 19 buildings , bafflingly interconnected ( pages 230-31 ) . Together they comprise one of the largest municipal structures in New York City . Inside , protected by four acres of glass , more than 2,300 habitat groups , mounted specimens , showcases , dioramas , and scientific exhibits fill 58 great halls and alcoves open to the public . As a gateway to nature , this institution has few peers . The museum 's visitors in one 12-month period included Premiers Jawaharlal Nehru of India and Antonin Novotny of Czechoslovakia , and Crown Prince Akihito of Japan .

Chilean Mummy Still " Perspires " Although the museum 's magnetism reaches round the world , most visitors naturally come from New York and surrounding communities . And they display an appropriate sense of ownership . Many call it simply " The Museum , " as though no other existed . I have met New Yorkers who have never set foot inside it ; but I know none who has contented himself with a single visit . It would be as unthinkable as eating one salted peanut . Simply to walk the museum 's 23-acre maze of corridors , exhibit areas , laboratories , offices , and storerooms requires roughly ten hours . And this demands steely self-discipline . It leaves no time for a lingering look at the bones of an extinct , ten-foot-tall moa from New Zealand , or the blackened mummy of a prehistoric Chilean copper miner , who still exudes a strange " perspiration " when the humidity is just so .

Today 's expedition is a compact affair ; often it is simply a single scientist . And , unlike our Central Asiatic Expeditions of 40 years ago , he usually knows precisely what he is looking for . The National Geographic Society and the American Museum have jointly sponsored several expeditions , most notably those of ornithologist E. Thomas Gilliard . NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC readers are familiar with his highly successful explorations of New Guinea , New Britain , Little Tobago , and British Guiana , in search of rare birds of paradise and the colorful cock-of-the-rock.1 ' As I write this , a museum scientist is wading through the surf off a tropical island in the West Indies while making a geological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jungle to study the behavior of a poisonous frog .

One species in our rare bird collection ex ; ) ired uniquely . Dr. Amadon recently showed me a small , brown , wrenlike bird named Traz.ersia lyalli ? one of three the museum possesses . In the 1890 's the species was discovered on Stephens Island in New Zealand 's Cook Strait ; not by an ornithologist , but by a lighthouse keeper 's cat . It brought home nearly a dozen specimens before the supply ran out . Forever . The museum has one of the world 's largest collections of birds ( page 227 ) . It grew to greatness under Dr. Frank AI . Chapman , Curator from 1920 to his death in 1945 . He has been called the " most influential ornithologist since Audubon , " and his name still serves his science ? in the museum 's $1,500,000 Chapman Fund for ornithological research . Of What Value Is a Baby ? Even in this enlightened age , some still may question the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Benjamin Franklin once replied to this kind of question with one of his own : Of what value is a newborn child ? " Since 1948 , Dr. Pedro Wygodzinsky , a recent addition to our entomology staff , has labored at the classification of the subfamily Triatominae . Of what use is it to distinguish among species of this little insect ? The answer is that certain species transmit debilitating Chagas ' disease , which afflicts hundreds of thousands of people in South America . Eliminating the culprit insect can control the incurable disease , but correct classification is essential before health agencies can know which species to control .

Last winter , when my wife and I were working there on a project involving the green turtle , I found myself often drawn to a small room lined with loudspeakers , electronic apparatus , and tape recorders . Through cables from hydrophones submerged offshore , Dr. John C. Steinberg and his associates from the University of Miami ? with support from the Office of Naval Research ? are recording an incredible Gulf Stream chorus : sounds resembling a French taxicab horn , the cooing of a dove , the pop of a champagne cork , a pack of yelping dogs , a donkey 's bray , the rumble of an earthquake . Some of these sounds are too high-pitched for the human ear to detect ; the tapes , slowed eight times , reveal submarine voices reminiscent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A few of these noisemakers have been identified , such as the bottle-nosed dolphin and several species of whale , which emit an odd variety of clicks , whistles , and squeals .
