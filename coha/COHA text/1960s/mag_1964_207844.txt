MOST of TIME 'S reporting is done by its 90 staff correspondents in 30 bureaus around the world-such as Chicago Bureau Chief Murray Gart , who did the major digging for this week 's cover story , and Tokyo Bureau Chief Jerrold Schecter , who covered the International Monetary Fund meeting in Tokyo for WORLD BUSINESS . But an important part of our coverage is supplied by more than 300 part-time correspondents - known in the office vocabulary as " stringers " - who report to us from near ( Philadelphia ) and far ( Salisbury , Southern Rhodesia ) . <P> Some of the stringers are unexpected types-for example , Dolly Connelly of Bellingham , Wash. , a housewife who bakes very good oatmeal-walnut yeast bread , and who is also a freelance journalist who covers her area of the Northwest U.S. with a bright and knowing touch . Most of the part-time correspondents , however , are full-time professional journalists who hold positions of importance in the areas they cover . <P> Two of the best of our overseas stringers find themselves collaborating these weeks on an international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage of Denmark 's Princess Anne-Marie to Greece 's King Constantine . TIME 'S man on this story in Copenhagen is Knud Meister ( cable address : TIMEISTER ) , one of Denmark 's best-known journalists . A top staff member of Copenhagen 's leading daily , Berlingske Tidende , he is also author of many books . For the past year , Meister 's daughter , Birgit , 22 , who wants to follow in her father 's journalistic path in Denmark , has been working for TIME in Manhattan . Watching her progress , and recalling that he has represented TIME in Denmark since 1949 , her father has let it be known that he hopes " some day TIME will hire a new stringer , and this time a girl , and that the cable address can then be preserved . " <P> <P> Our man at the other end of the royal wedding story is Anthony Antonakakis , TIME 'S representative in Greece since 1956 . He is not only a top figure in Greek journalism , as editorial writer for a leading Athens newspaper , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English ) and two volumes of history of the French Revolution . His wife , who holds a doctorate in education from Columbia University , is a leader in Greek education . <P> <P> While TIME is essentially U.S.-oriented , and is largely reported , written and edited by staff members who are American citizens , the intimate knowledge that the part-time correspondents abroad have of their countries makes an invaluable contribution to our perspective . In a somewhat different way , our part-time correspondents across the U.S. provide local knowledge and feeling that an outsider might easily miss . The stringers make their contribution not only by what they report directly to the editors and writers in New York , but also in the guidance that they give our traveling correspondents . Many a full-time correspondent , writer and editor has a particularly close knowledge of what a stringer can contribute-because he used to be one himself .
