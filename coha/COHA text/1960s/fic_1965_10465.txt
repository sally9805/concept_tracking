LOOKING GLASS WAR Avery 's Runpool , " Leclerc said . " Quite absurd not having our own cars . The Circus has a whole fleet . " And then , " Perhaps the Ministrywill believe me now . Perhaps they 'll finally accept we 're still an operational department . " " Did Taylor collect the film ? " Avery asked . " Do we know whether he got it ? " " I 've no inventory of his possessions , " Leclerc replied indignantly . " At the moment , all his effects are impounded by the Finnish police . Perhaps the film is among them . It 's a small place and 1 imagine they like to stick to the letter of the law . " And casually , so that Avery knew it mattered , " The Foreign Office is afraid there may be a muddle . " " Oh dear , " said Avery automatically . It was their practice in the Department : antique and understated . Leclerc looked directly at him now , taking interest . " The Resident Clerk at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . They refuse to involve themselves . They say we 're a clandestine service and must do it our own way . Somebody 's got to go out there as next of kin ; that is the course they favor . To claim the body and effects and get them back here . I want you to go . " Avery was suddenly aware of the pictures round the room , of the boys who had fought in the war . They hung in two rows of six , either side of the model of a Wellington bomber , rather a dusty one , painted black with no insignia . Most of the photographs had been taken out of doors . Avery could see the hangars behind , and between the young , smilingfaces the half-hidden fuselages of parked aircraft . Beneath each photograph were signatures , already brown and faded , some fluent and racy , other  --  hey must have been the other-rank  --  elf-conscious and elaborate , as if the writers had come unnaturally to fame . There were no surnames , but sobriquets from children 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only the Mae West was uniform , the long hair and the sunny , boyish smile . They seemed to like having their photographs taken , as if being together were an occasion for laughter which might not be repeated . The men in front were crouching comfortably , like men used to crouching in gun turrets , and those behind had put their arms carelessly over one another 's shoulders . There was no affectation but a spontaneous goodwill which does not seem to survive war or photographs . One face was common to every picture , right to the end : the face of a slim , bright-eyed man in a duffle coat and corduroytrousers . He wore no life jacket and stood a little apart from the men as if he were somehow extra . He was smaller than the rest , older . His features were formed ; he had a purpose about him which the others lacked . He might have been their schoolmaster . Avery had once looked for his signature to see if it had altered in the nineteen years , but Leclerc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like his photographs : a shade more set around the jaw perhaps , a shade less hair . " But that would be an operational job , " said Avery uncertainly . " Of course . We 're an operational department , you know . " A little buck of the head . " You are entitled to operational subsistence . All you have to do is collect Taylor 's stuff . You 're to bring back everything except the film , which you deliver to an address in Helsinki . You 'll be instructed about that separately . You come back and you can help me with Leiser ? " " Could n't the Circus take it on ? I mean , could n't they do it more simply ? " This smile came slowly . " I 'm afraid that would n't answer at all . It 's our show , John : the commitment is within our 41THE LOOKING GLASS WARcompetence . A military target .

I thought you 'd enjoy it . 1t 's an important job , you know ; something new for you to tackle . " " Of course . I 'd like to go . . . if you mist me . " Leclerc enjoyed that . Now he pushed a piece of blue draft paper into Avery 's hand . It was covered with l , eclerc 's own writing , boyish and rounded . He had written " i phcmcral " at the top and underlined it . In the left-hand margin were his initials , all four , and beneath them the word Unclassified . Once more Avery began reading .

That 's as far as the Foreign Office people are prepared to go . They 've agreed to send this to the local consulate via I lclsinki . " Avery read : Following from Consular Department .

Avery informed and proposes fly out today take over body and effects . NAS flight 201 via Hamburg , ETA 1820 local time . Please pro- vide usual facilities and assistance . " I did n't know your passport number , " Leclerc said . " The plane leaves at three this afternoon . It 's only a small place ; I imagine the Consul will meet you at the airport . There 's a 42 flight from Hamburg every other day . If you do n't have to go to Helsinki you can take the same plane back . " " Could n't I be his brother ? " Avery asked lamely . " Half brother looks fishy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Foreign Office is being very sticky about passports . We had a lot of trouble about Taylor 's . " He had returned to the file . " A lot of trouble . It would mean calling you Malherbe as well , you see . I do n't think they 'd like that . " He spoke without attention , paying out rope . The room was very cold . Avery said , " What about our Scandinavian friend " ? Leclerclooked uncomprehending ? " Lansen . Should n't someone contact him ? " " I 'm attending to that . " Leclerc , hating questions , replied cautiously as if he might be quoted . " And Taylor 's wife ? " It seemed pedantic to say widow . " Are you attending to her ? " " I thought we 'd go around first thing in the morning . She does n't have a telephone . Telegrams are so cryptic . " " We ? " said Avery . " Do we both need to go ? " " You 're my aide , are n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avery longed for the sound of traffic and the buzz of telephones . By day they had people about them , the tramp of messengers , the drone of registry trolleys . He had the feeling , when alone with Leclerc , that the third person was missing . No one else made him so conscious of behavior , no one else had such a disintegrating effect on conversation . He wished Leclerc would give him something else to read . " Have you heard anything about Taylor 's wife ? " Leclerc asked . " Is she a secure sort of person ? " Seeing that Avery did not understand , he continued : 43THE LOOKING GLASS WAR " She could make it awkward for us , you know . If she de- cided to . We shall have to tread carefully . " " What will you say to her ? " " We shall play it by ear . The way we did in the war . She wo n't know , you see . She wo n't even know he was abroad . " " He might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old hand . He had his instructions and knew the rules . She must have a pension , that 's most important . Active service . " Ile made another brisk , finite ges- ture with his hand . " And the staff ; what will you tell them ? " " I shall hold a meeting this morning for Heads of Sections . As for the rest of the Department , we shall say it was an accident . " " Perhaps it was , " Avery suggested . Leclerc was smiling again ; an iron bar of a smile , like an affliction . " In which case we shall have told the truth ; and have more chance of getting that film . " There was still no traffic in the street outside . Avery felt hungry . Leclerc glanced at his watch . " You were looking at Gorton 's report , " Avery said . He shook his head , wistfully touched a file , revisiting a favorite album . " There 's nothing there . I 've read it over and over again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceivable size . Haldane 's people have been on them night and day . We just ca n't get any further . " Sarah was right : to help him wait . Leclerc sai  --  t seemed suddenly the point of their meet- ing ? " I 've arranged for you to have a short talk with George Smiley at the Circus after this morning 's conference . You 've heard of him ? " " No , " Avery lied . This was delicate ground . 44 " He used to be one of their best men . Typical of the Circus in some ways , of the better kind . He resigns , you know , and comes back . His conscience . One never knows whether he 's there or not . He 's a bit past it now . They say he drinks a good deal . Smiley has the North European desk .

How much do you know about the Circus ? " He might have been asking about women , wary , an older man without experience . " A bit , " said Avery . " The usual gossip . " Leclerc stood up and went to the window . " They 're a curiouscrowd . Some good , of course . Smiley was good . But they 're cheats , " he broke out suddenly . " That 's an odd word , I know , to use about a sister service , John . Lying 's second nature to them . Half of them do n't know any longer when they 're telling the truth . " He was inclining his head studiouslythis way and that to catch sight of whatever moved in the waking street below . " What wretched weather . There was a lot of rivalry during the war , you know . " " I heard . " " That 's all over now . I do n't grudge them their work . They 've more money and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , I doubt whether they do a better one . Nothing can touch our Research Section , for example . Nothing . " Avery suddenly had the feeling that Leclerc had revealed something intimate , a failed marriage or a discreditableact , and that now it was all right . " When you see Smiley , he may ask you about the operation . I do n't want you to tell him anything , do you see , except that you are going to Finland and you may be handling a film for urgent dispatch to London . If he presses you , sug-45TIIL LOOKING GLASS WAR Avery 's Rungest it is a training matter . That 's all you 're authorized to say . The background , Gorton 's report , future operations ? none of that concerns them in the least . A training matter . " " I realize that . But he 'll know about Taylor , wo n't he , if the F.O. knows ? " " Leave that to me . And do n't be misled into believing the Circus has a monopoly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We just do n't unnecessarily . " He had restated his text . Avery watched Leclerc 's slim back against the lightening sky outside ; a man excluded , a man without a card , he thought . " Could we light the fire ? " he asked , and went into the corridor where Pine had a cupboard for mops and brushes . There was kindling wood and some old newspapers . He came back and knelt in front of the fireplace , keeping the best pieces of cinder and coaxing the ash through the grate , just as he would in the flat at Christmas . " I wonder if it was really wise to let them meet at the airport , " he asked . " It was urgent . After Jimmy Gorton 's report , it was very urgent . It still is . We have n't a moment to lose . " Avery held a match to the newspaper and watched it burn . As the wood caught , the smoke began to roll gently into his face , causing his eyes to water behind his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " It was a scheduled flight . Ile had to get clearance in ad-vance . " Tossing more coal on to the fire , Avery got up and rinsed his hands at the basin in the corner , drying them on his handkerchief . " I keep asking Pine to put me out a towel , " said Leclerc . " They have n't enough to do , that 's half the trouble . " " Never mind . " Avery put the wet handkerchief in his46pocket . It felt cold against his thigh . " Perhaps they will have now , " he added without irony . " I thought I 'd get Pine to make me up a bed here . A sort of ops room . " Leclerc spoke cautiously , as if Avery might deprive him of the pleasure . " You can ring me here tonight from Finland . If you 've got the film , just say the deal 's come off . " " And if not ? " " Say the deal 's off . " " It sounds rather alike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad , I mean . Off ' and Come off . ' " Then say they 're not interested . Say something negative . You know what I mean . " Avery picked up the empty scuttle . " I 'll give this to Pine . " He passed the duty room . An Air Force clerk was half asleep beside the telephones . He made his way down the wooden staircase to the front door . " The Boss wants some coal , Pine . " The porter stood up , as he always did when anyone spoke to him , at attention by his bed in a barrack room . " I 'm sorry , sir . Ca n't leave the door . " " For God 's sake , I 'll look after the door . We 're freezing up there . " Pine took the scuttle , buttoned his tunic and disappeared down the passage . He did n't whistle these days . " And a bed made up in his room , " Avery continued when Pine returned . " Perhaps you 'd tell the duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towel . He must have a towel by his basin . " " Yes , sir . Wonderful to see the old Department on the march again . " " Where can we get breakfast around here ? Is there anywherenearby ? " 47THE LOOKING GLASS WAR " There 's the Cadena , " Pine replied doubtfully . " But I do n't know whether it would do for the Boss , sir . We had the canteen in the old days . Slingers and wadge . " It was quarter to seven . " When does the Cadena open ? " " Could n't say , sir . " " Tell me , do you know Mr. Taylor at all ? " He nearly said " did . " " Oh yes , sir . " " Have you met his wife ? " " No , sir . " " What 's she like ? Have you any idea ? heard anything ? " " Could n't say , I 'm sure , sir . Very sad business indeed , sir . " Avery looked at him in astonishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went upstairs . Sooner or later hewould have to telephone Sarah . CHAPTER IIITHEY breakfasted somewhere . Leclerc refused to go into the Cadena and they walked interminably until they found another cafe , worse than the Cadena and more expensive . " I ca n't remember him , " Leclerc said . " That 's the absurd thing . He 's a trained radio operator apparently . Or was in those days . " Avery thought he was talking about Taylor . " How old did you say he was ? " " Forty , something over . That 's a good age . A Danzig Pole . They speak German , you know . Not as mad as the pure Slay . After the war he drifted for a couple of years , pulled himself together and bought a garage . He must have made a nice bit . " " Then I do n't suppose he 'll ? " " Nonsense . He 'll be grateful , or should be . " Leclerc paid the bill and kept it . As they left the restau-4948THE LOOKING CLASS WAILrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill to Accounts . " You can claim for night duty as well , you know . Or time in lieu . " ' I ' 1-ey walked down the road . " Your air ticket is booked . Carol did it from her flat . We 'd better give you an advance for expenses . There 'll be the business of having his body sent and that kind of thing . I understand it can be very costly . You 'd better have him flown . We 'll do a postmortem privately over here . " " I 've never seen a dead man before , " Avery said . They were standing on a street corner in Kennington , looking for a taxi ; a gasworks on one side of the road , nothing on the other : the sort of place they could wait all day . " John , you 've to keep very quiet about that side of it ; about putting a man in . No one 's to know , not even in the Department , no one at all . I thought we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll call him Mayfly . " " All right . " " It 's very delicate ; a question of timing . I 've no doubt there 'll be opposition , within the Department as well as out-side . " " What about my cover and that kind of thing ? " Avery asked . " I 'm not quite . . . " A taxi with its flag up passed them without stopping . " Bloody man , " Leclerc snapped . " Why did n't he pick us up ? " " he lives out here , I expect . I ie 's making for the West End . About cover , " he prompted . " You 're traveling under your own name . I do n't see that there 's any problem . You can use your own address . Call yourself a publisher . After all you were one . The Consul will show you the ropes . What are you worried about ? " " Wel  --  ust the details . " Leclerc , coming out of his reverie , smiled . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll learn for yourself . Never volunteer information . People do n't expect you to explain yourself . After all , what is there to explain ? The ground 's prepared ; the Consul will have our teleprint . Show your passport and play the rest by ear . " " I 'll try , " said Avery . " You 'll succeed , " Leclerc rejoined with feeling , and they both grinned shyly . " How far is it to the town ? " Avery asked . " From the air-port . " " About three miles . It feeds the main ski resorts . Heaven knows what the Consul does all day . " " And to Helsinki ? " " I told you . A hundred miles . Perhaps more . " Avery proposed they take a bus but Leclerc would n't queue so they remained standing at the corner . He began talking about official cars again . " It 's utterly absurd , " he said . " In the old days we had a pool of our own , now we have two vans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overtime . How can I run the Department under those condi-tions ? " In the end they walked . Leclerc had the address in his head ; he made a point of remembering such things . It was awkward for Avery to walk beside him for long , because Leclerc adjusted his pace to that of the taller man . Avery tried to keep himself in check , but sometimes he forgot and Leclerc would stretch uncomfortably beside him , thrusting upward with each stride . A fine rain was falling . It was still very cold . There were times when Avery felt for Leclerc a deep , protectivelove . Leclerc had that indefinable quality of arousing guilt , as if his companion but poorly replaced a departed friend . Somebody had been there , and gone ; perhaps a51THE LOOKING GLASS WAR Avery 's Runwhole world , a generation ; somebody had made him and disowned him , so that while at one moment Avery could hate him for his transparent manipulation , detest his prinkinggestures as a child detests the affectations of a parent , at the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Beyond all the vicissitudes of their relationship , he was somehow grateful that Leclerc had engendered him ; and thus they created that strong love which only exists between the weak ; each became the stage to which the other related his actions . It would be a good thing , " Leclerc said suddenly , " if you shared the handling of Mayfly . " " I 'd like to . " When you get back . ' ? They had found the address on the map . Thirty-four RoxburghGardens ; it was off Kennington High Street . The road soon became dingier , the houses more crowded . Gaslights burned yellow and flat like paper moons . " In the war they gave us a hostel for the staff . " " Perhaps they will again , " Avery suggested . " It 's twenty years since 1 did an errand like this . " " Did you go alone then ? " Avery asked , and wished at once that he had not . It was so easy to inflict pain on Leclerc . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died for their country . We did n't have to tell them the details ; they did n't expect that . " So it was we , thought Avery . Some other boy , one of those laughing faces on the wall . " They died every day then , the pilots . We did reconnaissance , you know , as well as special operation . . . . I 'm ashamed sometimes : I ca n't even remember their names . They were so young , some of them . " There passed across Avery 's mind a tragic procession of52horror-struck faces : mothers and fathers , girl friends and wives , and he tried to visualize Leclerc standing among them , naive yet footsure , like a politician at the scene of a disaster . They stood at the top of a rise . It was a wretched place . The road led downward into a line of dingy , eyeless houses ; above them rose a single block of flat  --  oxburgh Gardens . A string of lights shone on the glazed tiles , dividing and redividing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very ugly in its way , the beginning of a new world , and at its feet lay the black rubble of the old : crumbling , oily houses haunted by sad faces which moved through the rain like driftwood in a forgotten harbor . Leclerc 's frail fists were clenched ; he stood very still . " There ? " he said . " Taylor lived there ? " " What 's wrong ? It 's part of a scheme , redevelopment . . . " Then Avery understood . Leclerc was ashamed . Taylor had disgracefully deceived him . This was not the society they protected , these slums with their Babel 's Tower : they had no place in Leclerc 's scheme of things . To think that a member of Leclerc 's staff should daily trudge from the breath and stink of such a place to the sanctuary of the Department : had he no money , no pension ? Had he not a little bit beside , as we all have , just a hundred or two , to buy himself out of this squalor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Avery said involuntarily ; it was meant to comfort him . " Everyone knows we used to be in Baker Street , " Leclerc retorted . They made their way quickly to the base of the block , past shopwindows filled with old clothes and rusted electric heaters , all the sad muddle of useless things which only the53THE LOOKING GLASS WAR Avery 's Runpoor will buy . There was a chandler ; his candles were yellowand dusty like fragments of a tomb . " What number ? " Leclerc asked . " You said thirty-four . " They passed between heavy pillars crudely ornamented with mosaics , followed plastic arrows marked with pink numbers ; they squeezed between lines of aged , empty cars , until finally they came to a concrete entrance with cartons of milk on the step . There was no door , but a flight of rubberized steps which squeaked as they trod . The air smelled of food and that liquid soap they dispense in railway lavatories . On the heavy stucco wall a hand-painted notice discouraged noise . Somewhere a wireless played . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , half-glazed . Mounted on it in letters of white bakclite was the number 34 . Leclerc took off his hat and wiped the sweat from his temples . He might have been entering church . It had been raining more than they realized ; their coats were quite wet . He pressed the bell . Avery was suddenly very frightened . He glanced at Leclerc and thought , This is your show ; you tell her . The music seemed louder . They strained their ears to catch some other sound , but there was none . " Why did you call him Nialhcrbe ? " Avery asked suddenly . Leclerc pressed the hell again ; and then they heard it , both of them , a whimper midway between the sob of a child and the whine of a cat , a throttled , metallic sigh . While Leclercstepped back , Avery seized the bronze knocker on the letter box and banged it violently . The echo died away and they heard from inside the flat a light , reluctant tread ; a bolt was slid from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , much louder and more distinctly , the same plaintive monotone . The door opened a few inches and54Avery saw a child , a frail , pallid rag of a girl not above ten years old . She wore steel-rimmed spectacles , the kind Anthonywore . In her arms , its pink limbs splayed stupidly about it , its painted eyes staring from between fringes of ragged cotton , was a doll . Its daubed mouth was lolling open , its head hung sideways as if it were broken or dead . It is called a talking doll , but no living thing uttered such a sound . " Where is your mother ? " asked Leclerc . His voice was aggressive , frightened . The child shook her head . " Gone to work . " " Who looks after you , then ? " She spoke slowly as if she were thinking of something else . " Mum comes back teatimes . I 'm not to open the door . " " Where is she ? Where does she go ? " " Work . " " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Who gives you dinner ? " Avery said quickly . " Mrs. Bradley . After school . " Then Avery asked , " Where 's your father ? " and she smiled and put a finger to her lips . " He 's gone on an airplane , " she said . " To get money . But I 'm not to say . It 's a secret . " Neither of them spoke . " He 's bringing me a present , " she added . " Where from ? " said Avery . " From the North Pole , but it 's a secret . " She still had her hand on the doorknob . " Where Father Christmas comes from . " " Tell your mother some men were here , " Avery said . " From your dad 's office . We 'll come again teatime . " " It 's important , " said Leclerc. 55THE LOOKING GLASS WARShe seemed to relax when she heard they knew her father . " He 's on an airplane , " she repeated . Avery felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the change from Sarah 's ten shillings . She closed the door , leavingthem on that damned staircase with the wireless playing dreamy music. 56CHAPTER IVTHEY stood in the street not looking at one another . Leclerc said , " Why did you ask that question , the question about her father ? " Avery offered no reply ; Leclerc did not seem to expect one . Sometimes Leclerc seemed neither to hear , nor to feel ; he drifted away , listening for a sound , like a man who having learned the steps had been deprived of the music . This mood read like a deep sadness , like the bewilderment of a man betrayed . " I 'm afraid I sha n't be able to come back here with you this afternoon , " Avery said gently . " Perhaps Bruce Woodfordwould be preferred . . . " " Bruce is no good . " He added : " You 'll be at the meeting ; at ten forty-five ? " " I may have to leave before the end to get to the Circus and collect my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay at the 57THE LOOKING GLASS WAR I Avery 's Runoffice as long as I can . I 'm sorry I asked that question , I really am . " " I do n't want anyone to know . I must speak to her mother first . There may be some explanation . Taylor 's an old hand . He knew the rules . " " I sha n't mention it , I promise I sha n't . Nor Mayfly . " " I must tell Haldane about Mayfly . He 'll object of course . Yes , that 's what we 'll call it . . . the whole operation . We 'll call it Mayfly . " The thought consoled him . They hurried to the office , not to work but for refuge ; for anonymity , a quality they had come to need . His room was one along from I.eclerc 's . It had a label on the door saying ASSISTANT 1 ' 0 r -- - ' . llnu  --  oi- . Two years ago Leclerc had been invited to America , and the expression dated from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to by the function they fulfilled . Ilcnce Avery was known simply as Private Office ; though Leclerc might alter the title every week , he could not alter the vernacular . At a quarter to eleven Woodford came into his room . Avery guessed he would : a little chat before the meeting began , a quiet word about some matter not strictly on the agenda . " What 's it all about , John ? " I le lit his pipe , tilted back his large head and extinguished the match with long , swinging movements of his hand . Ile had once been a schoolmaster ; an athletic man . " You tell me . " " Poor Taylor . " " Precisely . " " I do n't want to jump the gun , " he said , and settled himself on the edge of the desk , still absorbed in his pipe . " I do n't want to jump the gun , John , " he repeated , " but there's58another matter we ought to look at , tragic as Taylor 's death is . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green suit and said , " Registry . " " That 's Haldane 's parish . Research . " " I 've got nothing against old Adrian . He 's a good scout . We 've been working together for over twenty years . " And therefore you 're a good scout too , thought Avery . Woodford had a way of coming close when he spoke ; riding his heavy shoulder against you like a horse rubbing itself against a gate . He leaned forward and looked at Avery earnestly : a plain man perplexed , he was saying , a decent man choosing between friendship and duty . His suit was hairy , too thick to crease , forming rolls like a blanket ; rough-cut buttons of brown bone . " John , Registry 's all to the devil ; we both know that . Papers are n't being entered , files are n't brought up on the right dates . " He shook his head in despair . " We 've been missinga policy file on marine freight since mid-October . Just vanished into thin air . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avery said . " We were all involved , not just Adrian . Files do get lost ? this is the first since April , Bruce . I do n't think that 's bad , considering the amount we handle . I thought Registry was one of our best things . The files are immaculate . I understandour Research index is unique . That 's all Adrian 's doing , is n't it ? Still , if you 're worried , why not speak to Adrian about it ? " " No , no . It 's not that important . " Carol came in with the tea . Woodford had his in a pottery jumbo-cup with his initials drawn large , embossed like icing . As Carol put it down , she remarked , " Wilf Taylor 's dead . " 59THE LOOKING CLASS WAR " I 've been here since ( me , " Avery lied , " coping with it . We 've been working all night . " " The Director 's very upset , " she said . " What was his wile like , Carol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taller than Sarah . " Nobody 's met her . " She left the room , Woodford watching her . Iie took his pipe from his mouth and grinned . Avery knew he was going to say something about sleeping with Carol and suddenly he 'd had enough . " Did your wife make that cup , Bruce ? " lie asked quickly . " I hear she 's quite a potter . " " Made the saucer as well , " he said . Ile began talking about the classes she went to , the ; mousing way it had caught on in Wimbledon , how his wife was tickled to death . It was nearly eleven ; they could hear the others gathering in the corridor . " I 'd better go next door , " Avery said , " and see if he 's ready . He 's taken quite a beating in the last eight hours . " Woodford picked up his , mng and took a sip of tea . " If you get a chance , niention that liegistry business to the Boss , John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of everyone else . Adrian 's getting a bit past it . " " The Director 's very tied up at the moment , Bruce . " " Oh , quite . " " He hates to interfere with Ilalda -- e . You know that . " As they reached the door of his room he turned to Woodford and asked , " Do you remember a man called Malherbe in the Department ? " Woodford stopped dead . " God , yes . A young chap , like you . In the war . Good Lord ! " And earnestly , but quite unlikehis usual manner : " Do n't mention that name to the Boss. 60Avery 's RunHe was very cut up about young Malherbe . One of the specialfliers . The two of them were quite close in a way . " Leclerc 's room by daylight was not so drab as of an impermanentappearance . You would think its occupant had requisitionedit hastily , under conditions of emergency , and had not known how long he would be staying . Maps lay sprawled over the trestle table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a scale large enough to show streets and buildings . Teletape , pasted in strips on pink paper , hung in batches on the notice board , fastened with a heavy bulldog clip like galley proofs awaiting correction . A bed had been put in one corner with a bedspread over it . A clean towel hung beside the basin . The desk was new , of gray steel , government issue . The walls were filthy . Here and there the cream paint had peeled , showing dark green beneath . It was a small , square room with Ministry of Works curtains . There had been a row about the curtains , a question of equating Leclerc 's rank to the Civil Service scale . It was the one occasion , so far as Avery knew , when Leclerc had made any effort to improve the disorder of the room . The fire was nearly out . Sometimes when it was very windy the fire would not burn at all , and all through the day Avery could hear from next door the soot falling in the chimney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Sandford , Dennison and McCulloch . They had all heard about Taylor . It was easy to imagine the news going round the Department , not as headlines , but as a small and gratifyingsensation passed from room to room , lending a briskness to the day 's activity , as it had to these men ; giving them a moment 's optimism , like a raise in pay . They would watch Leclerc , watch him as prisoners watch a guard . They knew61THE LOOKING GLASS WARhis routine by instinct , and they waited for him to break it . There would not be a man or woman in the Department but knew they had been called in the middle of the night , and that Leclerc was sleeping in the office . They settled themselves at the table , putting their cups in front of them noisily like children at a meal , Leclerc at the head , the others on either side , an empty chair at the further end . Haldane came in , and Avery knew as soon as he saw him that it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tl-e empty chair , he said , " I see I 'm to take the draftiest place . " Avery rose , but Haldane had sat down . " Do n't bother , Avery . I 'm a sick man already . " IIc coughed , just as he coughed all year . Not even the sunuuer could help him , apparently ; he coughed in all seasons . The others fidgeted uncomfortably ; Woodford helped himself to a biscuit . Haldane glanced at the fire . " Is that the best the Ministry of Works can manage ? " lie asked . " It 's the rain , " Avery said . " The rain disagrees with it . Pine 's had a go but 1-e made no difference . " " Ah . " Haldane was a lean man with long , restless fingers ; a man locked in himself , slow i --  his movements , agile in his features , balding , spare , querulous and dry ; a man seemingly contemptuous of everything , keeping his own hours and his own counsel ; addicted to crossword puzzles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting them on Leclerc'sdesk , which in contrast to the remainder of his room was very tidy . They waited awkwardly until she had gone . The door securely closed , Leclerc passed his hand cautiously over his dark hair as if he were not quite familiar with it. 62Avery 's Run " Taylor 's been killed . You 've all heard it by now . He was killed last night in Finland traveling under another name . " Avery noticed he never mentioned Malherbe . " We do n't know the details . He appears to have been run over . I 've told Carol to put it about that it was an accident . Is that clear ? " Yes , they said , it was quite clear . " He went to collect a film from . . . a contact , a Scandinaviancontact . You know whom I mean . We do n't normally use the routine couriers for operational work , but this was different ; something very special indeed . I think Adrian will back me up there . " He made a little upward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his white cuffs , laying the palms and fingers vertically together ; praying for Haldane 's support . " Special ? " Haldane repeated slowly . His voice was thin and sharp like the man himself , cultivated , without emphasis and without affectation ; an enviable voice . " It was different , yes . Not least because Taylor died . We should never have used him , never , " he observed flatly . " We broke a first principle of intelligence . We used a man on the overt side for a clandestine job . Not that we have a clandestine side any-more . " " Shall we let our masters be the judges of that ? " Leclerc suggested demurely . " At least you 'll agree the Ministry is pressing us daily for results . " He turned to those on either side of him , now to the left , now to the right , bringing them in like shareholders . " It is time you all knew the details . We are dealing with something of exceptional security classification , you understand . I propose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only Adrian Haldane and one or two of his staff in Research have been initiated . And John Avery as my aide . I wish to emphasize that our sister service knows noth-63THE LOOKING GLASS WARing whatever about it . Now about our own arrangements . The operation has the codeword Mayfly . " He was speaking in his clipped , effective voice . " There is one action file , which will be returned to me personally , or to Carol if I am out , at the end of each day ; and there is a library copy . That is the system we used in the war for operational files and I think you are all familiar with it . It 's the system we shall use henceforth . I shall add Carol 's name to the subscription list . " Woodford pointed at Avery with his pipe , shaking his head . Not young John there ; John was not familiar with the system . Sandford , sitting ; beside Avery , explained . The librarycopy was kept iu the cipher room . It was against regulationsto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered on it as soon as they were made ; the subscription list was the list of persons authorized to read it . No pins were allowed ; all the papers had to be fast . The others looked on complacently . Sandford was Administration ; he was a fatherly man in gold-rimmed spectacles and carne to the office on a motorbike . Leclerc had objected once , on no particular grounds , and now he parked it down the road opposite the Hospital . " Now , about the operation , " Leclerc said . The thin line of his joined hands bisected his bright face . Only Haldane was not watching him ; his eyes were turned away toward the window . Outside , the rain was falling gently against the buildings like spring rain in a dark valley . Abruptly Leclerc rose and went to a map of Europe on the wall . There were small flags pinned to it . Stretching upwardswith his arm , riding on his toes to reach the Northern Hemisphere , he said , " We 're having a spot of trouble with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In the area south of Rostock ; a place called Kalkstadt , just here . " His finger64Avery 's Runtraced the Baltic coastline of Schleswig-Holstein , moved east and stopped an inch or two south of Rostock . " To put it in a nutshell , we have three indicators which sugges  --  can not say prov  --  hat something big is going on there in the way of military installations . " He swung around to face them . He would remain at the map and say it all from there , to show he had the facts in his memory and did n't need the papers on the table . " The first indicator came exactly a month ago when we received a report from our representative in Hamburg , Jimmy Gorton . " Woodford smiled . Good God , was old Jimmy still going ? " An East German refugee crossed the border near Lubeck , swam the river ; a railwayman from Kalkstadt . He went to our Consulate and offered to sell them information about a new rocket site near Rostock . I need hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foreign Office will not even give us the facilities of its bag service , it is unlikely " ? a thin smile ? " that they will assist us by buying military information . " A nice murmur greeted this joke . " However , by a stroke of luck Gorton got to hear of the man and went to Flensburg to see him . " Woodford would not let this pass . Flensburg ? Was not that the place where they had located German submarines in forty-one ? Flensburg had been a hell of a show . Leclerc nodded at Woodford indulgently , as if he too had been amused by the recollection . " The wretched man had been to every allied office in North Germany , but no one would look at him . Jimmy Gorton had a chat with him . Implicit in Leclerc 's way of describing things was an assumption that Gorton was the only intelligent man among a lot of fools . He crossed to his desk , took a cigarette from the65THE LOOKING GLASS WARsilver box , lit it , picked up a file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it noiselessly on the table in front of them . " This is Jimmy 's report , " he said . " It 's a first-class bit of work by any standard . " The cigarette looked very long between his fingers . " The defector 's name , " he added incon- sequentially , " was Fritsche . " " Defector ? " Haldane put in quickly . " The man 's a low- grade refugee , a railwayman . We clout usually talk about men like that defecting . " Leclerc replied defensively , " The man 's not only a railway- man . He 's a bit of a mechanic and a bit of a photographer . " McCulloch opened the file and I cgan methodically turn- ing over the serials . Sandford watched hint through his gold- rimmed spectacles . " On the first or second of Septembe  --  e do n't know which because he ca n't rcpt ennlhe  --  e happened to be doing a double shift in the dumping sheds at Kalkstadt . One of his comrades was sick . Ile was to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till ten at tight . When he arrived to report for work there were a cloven Vopos , East German people 's police , at the station entrance . All passenger traffic was forbidden . They checked his identity papers against a list and told hint to keep away from the sheds on the eastern side of the station . They said , " Leclerc added deliberately , " that if he approached the eastern sheds he was liable to be shot . " This impressed them . Woodford said it was typical of the Germans . " It 's the Russians we 're fighting , " Haldane put in . " He 's an odd fish , our man . Iie seems to have argued with them . He told them he was as reliable as they were , a good German and a Party member . He showed them his union card , photographs of his wife and heaven knows what . It66Avery 's Rundid n't do any good , of course , because they just told him to obey orders and keep away from the sheds . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up some soup at ten o'clock they called him over and offered him a cup . Over the soup he asked them what was going on . They were cagey , but he could see they were excited . Then somethinghappened . Something very important , " he continued . " One of the younger ones blurted out that whatever they had in the sheds could blow the Americans out of West Germany in a couple of hours . At this point an officer came along and told them to get back to work . " Haldane coughed a deep , hopeless cough , like an echo in an old vault . What sort of officer , someone asked , was h  --  erman or Russian ? " German . That is most relevant . There were no Russians in evidence at all . " Haldane interrupted sharply . " The refugee saw none . That 's all we know . Let us be accurate . " He coughed again . It was very irritating . " As you wish . He went home and had lunch . He was disgruntledat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of young fellows playing soldiers . He had a couple of glasses of schnapps and sat there brooding about the dumping shed . Adrian , if your cough is troubling you . . . " Haldane shook his head . " He remembered that on the northern side it abutted an old storage hut , and that there was a shutter-type ventilator let into the party wall . He formed the notion of looking through the ventilator to see what was in the shed . As a way of getting his own back on the soldiers . " Woodford laughed . " Then he decided to go one further and photograph whatever was there . " 67THE LOOKING GLASS WAR Avery 's Run " He must have been mad , " Haldane commented . " I find this part impossible to accept . " " Mad or not , that 's what he decided to do . He was cross because they would n't trust him . He felt he had a right to know what was in the shed . " Leclerc missed a beat , then took refuge in technique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , East German manufacture . It 's a cheap housingbut takes all the Exakta range lenses ; far fewer speeds than the Exakta , of course . " lle looked inquiringly at the technicians , Dennison and McCulloch . " Am I right , gentlemen ? " he asked . " You must correct inc . " They smiled sheepishlybecause there was nothing to correct . " Ile had a good wide-angle lens . The difficulty was the light . His next shift did n't begin till four and by that time dusk would be fallingand there would be even less light inside the shed . He had one fast Agfa film which he 'd been keeping for a special occasion ; it had a DIN speed of twenty-six . He decided to use that . " IIe paused , more for effect than for questions . " Why did n't he wait till next morning ? " Haldane asked . " In the report , " Leclerc continued blandly , " you 'll find a very full account by Lorton of how the man got into the hut , stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ventilator. tin not going to repeat all that now . He used the maximum aperture of two-point-eight , speeds ranging from a quarter of a second to two seconds . A fortunate piece of German thoroughness . " No one laughed . " The speeds were guesswork , of course . He was bracketing an estimated exposure time of one second . Only the last three frames show anything . Here they are . " Leclerc unlocked the steel drawer of his desk and extracteda set of high-gloss photographs twelve inches by nine . He was smiling a little , like a man looking at his own68reflection . They gathered round , all but Haldane and Avery , who had seen them before . Something was there . You could see it if you looked quickly ; something hidden in the disintegrating shadows ; but keep looking and the dark closed in and the shape was gone . Yet something was there ? the muffled form of a gun barrel , but pointed and too long for its carriage , the suspicion of a transporter , a vague glint of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protective covers over them , of course , " Leclerc commented , studying their faces hopefully , waiting for their optimism . Avery looked at his watch . It was twenty past eleven . " I shall have to go soon , Director , " he said . He still had n't rung Sarah . " I have to see the accountant about my air ticket . " " Stay another ten minutes , " Leclerc pleaded , and Haldane asked , " Where 's he going ? " Leclerc replied , throw-away , " To take care of Taylor . He has a date at the Circus first . " " What do you mean , take care of him ? Taylor 's dead . " There was an uncomfortable silence . " You know very well that Taylor was traveling under an alias . Somebody has to collect his effects ; recover the film . Avery is going out as next of kin . The Ministry has already given its approval ; I was n't aware that I needed yours . " " To claim the body ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's an operational job ; Avery 's not trained . " " They were younger than he in the war . He can look after himself . " " Taylor could n't . What will he do when he 's got it ; bring it back in his sponge bag ? " 69THE LOOKING GLASS WAR " Shall we discuss that afterwards ? " Leclerc suggested , and addressed himself once more to the others , smiling patiently as if to say old Adrian must be humored . " That was all we had to go on till ten days ago . Then came the second indicator . The area around Kalkstadt had been declared a prohibited area . " There was an excited murmur of interest . " For a radius o  --  s far as we can establish ? thirty kilometers . Sealed off ; closed to all traffic . They brought in frontier guards . " Ile glanced round the table . " I then informed the Minister . I can not tell even you all the implications . But let mce name one . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time flicking upwards the little horns of graying hair that grew above his cars . Ilaldane was forgotten . " What puzzled us in the beginning " ? he nodded at Haldane , a conciliatory gesture at a moment of victory , but Haldane ignored it ? " was the absence of Soviet troops . They have units in Rostock , Witmar , Schwerin . " His finger darted among the flags . " But non  --  his is confirmed by other agencie  --  one in the immediate area of Kalkstadt . If there are weapons there , weapons of high destructive capacity , why are there no Soviet troops ? " McCulloch made a suggestion : might there not be technicians , Soviet technicians in civilian dress ? " I regard that as unlikely . " A demure smile . " In comparablecases where tactical weapons were being transported we have always identified at least one Soviet unit . On the other hand , five weeks ago a few Russian troops were seen at Gustweiler , farther south . " He was back to the map . " They billetedfor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; others had no shoulder-boards at all . They moved away southward early next morning . One might conclude they had brought something , left it and gone away again . " 70Avery 's RunWoodford was becoming restless . What did it all add up to , he wanted to know , what did they make of it over at the Ministry ? Woodford had no patience with riddles . Leclerc adopted his academic tone . It had a bullying qualityas if facts were facts and could not be disputed . " ResearchSection has done a magnificent job . The overall length of the object in these photograph  --  hey can computeit pretty exactl  --  s equal to the length of a Soviet middle-range rocket . On present information " ? he lightly tapped the map with his knuckles so that it swung sideways on its hook ? " the Ministry believes it is conceivable we are dealing with Soviet missiles under East German control . Research , " he added quickly , " is not prepared to go so far . Now if the Ministry view prevails , if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our hands " ? this was his moment ? " a sort of Cuba situation all over again , only " ? he tried to sound apologetic , to make it a throwaway line ? " more dangerous . " He had them . " It was at this point , " Leclerc explained , " that the Ministryfelt entitled to authorize an overflight . As you know , for the last four years the Department has been limited to aerial photographs along orthodox civilian or military air routes . Even these required Foreign Office approval . " He drifted away . " It really was too bad . " His eyes seemed to be searchingfor something not in the room . The others watched him anxiously , waiting for him to continue . " For once the Ministry agreed to waive the ruling , and I am pleased to say the task of mounting the operation was given to this Department . We selected the best pilot we could find on our books : Lansen . " Someone looked up in surprise ; agents ' names were never used that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go off course on a charter flight from Dusseldorf to Finland . Taylor was dispatched to collect the71THE LOOKING GLASS WARfilm ; he died at the landing field . A road accident , apparently . " Outside they could hear the sound of cars moving through the rain like the rustling of paper in the wind . The fire had gone out ; only the smoke remained , hanging like a shroud over the table . Sandford had raised his hand . What kind of missile was this supposed to be ? " A Sandal , Medium Range . I am told by Research that it was first shown in Red Square in November sixty-two . It has achieved a certain notoriety since then . It was the Sandal which the Russians installed in Cuba . The Sandal is also " ? a glance at Woodford ? " the linear descendant of the wartime German V-2 . " He fetched other photographs from the desk and laid them on the table . " Here is a Research Section photograph of the Sandal missile . They tell me it is distinguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed to the formation at the base ? " and by small fins . It is about forty feet long from base to cone . If you look carefully you will see tucks near the clam  --  ust her  --  hich hold the protective cloth cover in position . There is , ironically , no extant picture of the Sandal in protectivecovers . Possibly the Americans have one , but I do n't feel able to approach them at this stage . " Woodford reacted quickly . " Of course not , " he said . " The Minister was anxious that we should n't alarm them prematurely . One only has to suggest rockets to the Americansto get the most drastic reaction . Before we know where they are they 'll be flying U-2s over Rostock . " Encouraged by their laughter , Leclerc continued . " The Minister made another point which I think I might pass on to you . The country which comes under maximum threat from these72Avery 's Runrocket  --  hey have a range of around eight hundred miles ? might well be our own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this would be a bad moment to go hiding our faces in the Americans ' skirts . After all , as the Minister put it , we still have one or two teeth of our own . " Haldane said sarcastically , " That is a charming notion , " and Avery turned on him with all the anger he had fought away . " I think you might do better than that , " he said . He nearly added : Have a little mercy . Haldane 's cold gaze held Avery for a moment , then releasedhim , his case not forgiven but suspended . Someone asked what they would do next : suppose Avery did not find Taylor 's film ? Suppose it just was n't there ? Could they mount another overflight ? " No , " Leclerc replied . " Another overflight is out of the question . Far too dangerous . We shall have to try something else . " He seemed disinclined to go further , but Haldane said , " What , for instance ? " " We may have to put a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " This Department ? " Haldane asked incredulously . " Put a man in ? The Ministry would never tolerate such a thing . You mean , surely , you 'll ask the Circus to do it ? " " I have already told you the position . Heaven knows , Adrian , you 're not going to tell me we ca n't do it ? " He looked appealing round the table . " Every one of us here except young Avery has been in the business twenty years or more . You yourself have forgotten more about agents than half those people in the Circus ever knew . " " Hear , hear ! " Woodford cried . " Look at your own section , Adrian ; look at Research . 73There must have been half-a-dozen occasions in the last five years when the Circus actually came to you , asked you for advice , used your facilities and skills . The time may come when they do the same with agents ! The Ministry granted us an overflight . Why not an agent too ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow you . What was that ? " " Taylor 's death , " said I , eclerc . Avery got up , nodded goodbye and tiptoed to the door . Haldane watched hinm go . THERE was a note on his desk from Carol : Your wife rang . He walked into her office and found her sitting at her typewriterbut not typing . " You would n't talk about poor Wilf Taylor like that , " she said , " if you 'd known him better . " " Like what ? I have n't talked about him at all . " He thought he should comfort her , because sometimes they touched one another ; he thought she might expect that now . He bent forward , advancing until the sharp ends of her hair touched his cheek . Inclining his head inward so that their temples met , he felt her skin travel slightly across the flat bone of her skull . For a moment they remained thus , Carol sitting upright , looking straight ahead of her , her hands either side of the typewriter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath her arm and touching her breast , but did not ; both gently recoiling , they separated and were alone again . Avery stood up. 75 " Your wife telephoned , " she said . " I told her you were at the meeting . She wants to talk to you urgently . " " Thanks . I 'm on my way . " " John , what is going on ? What 's all this about the Circus ? What 's Leclerc up to ? " " I thought you knew . l lc said he 'd put you on the list . " " I do n't mean that . Why 's he lying to them again ? He 's dictated a memorandum to Control about some training scheme and you going abroad . fine took it around by hand .

Why send poor Taylor ? Even now the F.O. could iron it out , I 'm sure they could . He just wo n't give them a chance : he wvants to send you . " " You do n't understand , " Avery said shortly . " Another thing , " she demanded as he was going , " why does Adrian Haldane hate you so ? " He visited the accountant , then took a taxi to the Circus . Leclerc had said he could claim for it . He was cross that Sarah had tried to reach him at such a moment . He had told her never to ring him at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you read at Oxford ? It was Oxford , was n't it ?

" When Smiley said nothing he added , " Ger man principally . " Smiley was a small , distracted man with plump finger and a shadowy , blinking way with him which suggested dis comfort . Whatever Avery had expected , it was not this . " Well , well . " Smiley nodded to himself , a very private comment . " It 's a question of a courier , I believe , in I-Ielsinki You want to give him a film . A training scheme . " " Yes . " " It 's a most unusual request .

I 'm only playing a small part . It 's training . " " But if it 's training , why so much secrecy ? " " Well , Germany , " Avery said . " Thank you . " Smiley seemed embarrassed . He looked at his hands folded lightly on the desk before him . He asked Avery whether it was still raining . Avery said he was afraid so . " I 'm sorry to hear about Taylor , " he said . Avery said yes he was a good man . " Do you know what time you 'll have your film ? Tonight ? Tomorrow ? I , ccicrc rather thought tonight , I gather . " " I do n't know . It clep  --  uls how it goes . I just ca n't tell at the moment . " " No . " There followed a long , unexplained silence . He 's like an old man , thought Avery , he forgets he 's not alone . " No , there are so many imponderables . Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once or twice . " Again Smiley said nothing and did not seem to notice the gap . " How is everyone in l3laekfriars Road ? Do you know Haldane at all ? " Smiley asked . He did n't care about the reply . " He 's Research now . " " Of course . A good brain . Your Research people enjoy quite a reputation , you know . We have consulted them ourselvesmore than once . IIaldane and I were contemporaries at Oxford . Then in the war we worked together for a while . A Greats man . We 'd have taken him here after the war ; I think the medical people were worried about his chest . " " I had n't heard . " " Had n't you ? " The eyebrows rose comically .

" Smiley peered at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This Taylor : was he training too ? " " I do n't know . But I 'll find the hotel , " Avery said with a touch of impatience . " They sell magazines and postcards just inside the door . There 's only the one entrance . " He might have been talking about the house next door . " And flowers . I think the best arrangement would be for you to go there once you have the film . Ask the people at the flower stall to send a dozen red roses to Mrs. Avery at the Imperial Hotel at Torquay . Or half a dozen would be enough , we do n't want to waste money , do we ? Flowers are so expensive there . Are you traveling under your own name ? " " Yes . " " Any particular reason ?

" You can always come to us , you know . For passports , I mean . " It was meant as a kindness . " Just send the flowers . As you leave the hotel , check your watch by the hall clock . Half an hour later return to the main entrance . A taxi driver will recognize you and open the door of his car . Get in , drive around , give him the film . Oh , and pay him please . Just the ordinary fare . It 's so easy to forget the little things . What kind of training precisely ? " " What if I do n't get the film ? " 79THE LOOKING GLASS WAR " In that case do nothing .

" What a sill/ word . I suppose they mean extrinsic ; it 's a very impertinent notion . " As they reached the door lie said , " Have you a briefcase or anything ? " " Yes . " " When you have that film , put it in your pocket , " he suggested , " and carry the briefcase in your hand . If you are followed , they tend to watch the briefcase . It 's natural , really .

Avery walked upstairs to the flat , guessing how Sarah would react . He wished he had telephoned after all because he hated to find her in the kitchen , and Anthony 's toys all over the drawing room carpet . It never worked , turning up without warning . She took fright as if she expected him to have done something dreadful . He did not carry a key ; Sarah was always in . She had no friends of her own as far as he knew ; she never went to coffee parties or took herself shopping . She seemed to have no talent for independent pleasure. 80Avery 's RunHe pressed the bell , heard Anthony calling Mummy , Mummy , and waited to hear her step .

He telephoned her mother in Reigate and asked her to come straightaway . It was just before one when the doctor arrived . A fever , , he said ; some germ that was going the rounds .

Terribly . " " Who for ? " deleted linesLeclerc said , his voice scarcely above a whisper : " It began with the networks , did n't it ? Do you remember how the Circus swallowed them up one by one ? The Ministrywould say : We 're in danger of duplication on the Polish desks , Leclerc . I 've decided Control should look after Poland . ' When was that ? July forty-eight .

There 's no one else . ' fake whom you wan  --  very , Woodford , whomever you want . " " We 're not used to people anymore . Handling them , I mean . " Haldane had become unusually diffident . " I 'm a Researchman. 1 work with files . " " We 've had nothing else to give you until now . How long is it ? Twenty years . " " Do you know what it means , a rocket site ? " Haldane demanded . " Do you know how much mess it makes ? They need launch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they need bunkers for storing the warheads , trailers for fuel and oxidizers . All those things come first . Rockets do n't creep about in the night , they move like a traveling fair ; we 'd have other indicators before now ; or the Circus would . As for Taylor 's death ? " " For heaven 's sake , Adrian , do you think Intelligence consistsof unassailable philosophical truths ? Does every priest have to prove that Christ was born on Christmas Day ? " 86Avery 's RunHis little face was thrust forward as he tried to draw from Haldane something he seemed to know was there . " You ca n't do it all by sums , Adrian . We 're not academics , we 're Civil Servants . We have to deal with things as they are . We have to deal with people , with events ! " " Very well , events then : if he swam the river , how did he preserve the film ? How did he really take the pictures ? Why is n't there any trace of camera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on tiptoe ; they 're long enough exposures , you know , time exposures , " he said . Haldane seemed afraid , not of Leclerc , not of the operation , but of himself . " Why did he give Gorton for nothing what he 'd offered elsewhere for money ? Why did he risk his life at all , taking those photographs ? I sent Gorton a list of supplementaries . He 's still trying to find the man , he says . " His eyes drifted to the model airplane and the files on Leclerc 's desk . " You 're thinking of Peenemunde , are n't you ? " he continued . " You want it to be like Peenemunde . " " You have n't told me what you 'll do if I get those instruc-tions . " " You never will . You never , never will . " He spoke with great finality , almost triumph . " We 're dead , do n't you see ? You said it yourself . They want us to go to sleep , not go to war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't matter . It 's all academic after all . Can you really imagine Control would help us ? " " They 've agreed to help us with a courier . " " Yes . I find that most odd . " Haldane stopped before a photograph by the door . " That 's Malherbe , is n't it ? The boy who died . Why did you choose that name ? " " I do n't know . It just came into my head . One 's memory plays odd tricks . " " You should n't have sent Avery . We 've no business to use him for a job like that . " 87THE LOOKING GLASS WARLeclerc said , " I went through the cards last night . We 've got a man who 'd do .

" " He put up a good show . They caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How did he get caught ? " The slightest pause . " It is n't recorded . " " Intelligent ? " " Ile seems q Iitc well qualified . " The same long silence . " So am I. Let 's see what Avery brings back . " " Let 's see what the Ministry says . " Leclerc waited till the sound of coughing had faded down the corridor before he put on his coat . He would go for a walk , take some fresh air and have lunch at his club ; the best they had . He wondered what it would be ; the place had gone off badly in the last few years . After lunch he would go round to Taylor 's widow . Then to the Ministry . Woodford , lunching with his wife at Gorringe 's , said , " Young Avery 's on his first run . Clarkie sent him . He should make a good job of it . " " Perhaps he 'll get himself killed , too , " she said nastily . She was off the drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real ball . Christ , that would be a party and a half ! Come to the Blackfriars ' Ball !

We ca n't . . . " " All right , Babs , " he said . He was afraid she might cry. 88CHAPTER Takeoff VIAVERY sat in the airplane rememberingthe day when Haldane failed to appear . It was , by coincidence , the first of the month , July it must have been , and Haldane did not come to the office . Avery knew nothing of it until Woodford rang him on the internal telephone to tell him . Haldane was probably ill , Avery had said ; some personal matter had cropped up . But Woodford was adamant . He had been to Leclerc 's room , he said , and had looked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August . " Telephone his flat , John , telephone his flat , " he had urged . " Speak to his wife . Find out what 's become of him . " Avery was so astonished that he did not know what to say : those two had worked together for twenty years , and even he knew Haldane was a bachelor . " Find out where he is , " Woodford had persisted . " Go on , I order you : ring his flat . " So he did . He might have told Woodford to do it himself , 89THE LOOKING GLASS WAR I Avery 's Runbut he had n't the heart . Haldane 's sister answered . Haldane was in bed , his chest was playing him up ; he had refused to tell her the Department 's telephone number . As Avery 's eye caught the calendar , he realized why Woodford had been so agitated : it was the beginning of a quarter . Haldane might have got a new job and left the Department without telling Woodford . A day or two later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , bravely ignoring his sarcasm ; he was grateful to him for coming back . For sonic time after that , Avery had been frightened . His faith shaken , he examined more closely its object . IIe noticed that they ascribe  --  t was a plot in which all but Haldane compounde  --  egendary qualities to one another . Leclerc , for instance , would seldom introduce Avery to a member of his parent Ministry without some catchword . " Avery is the brightest of our new stars " ? or , to more senior men , " John is my memory . You must ask John . " For the same reason they lightly forgave one another their trespasses , because they dared not think , for their own sakes , that the Department had room for fools . He recognized that it provided shelter from the complexities of modern life , a place where frontiers still existed . For its servants , the Departmenthad a religious quality . Like monks , they endowed it with a mystical identity far away from the hesitant , sinful band which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the qualities of one another , contemptuous of their own hierarchical preoccupations , their faith in the Department burned in some separate chapel and they called it patriotism . For all that , as he glanced at the darkening sea beneath him , at the cold sunlight slanting on the waves , he felt his heart thrilling with love . Woodford with his pipe and his plain way became part of that secret elite to which Avery90now belonged ; Haldane , Haldane above all , with his crosswordsand his eccentricities , fitted into place as the **26;6665;TOOLONG , irritable and aloof . He was sorry he had been rude to Haldane . He saw Dennison and McCullochas the matchless technicians , quiet men , not articulate at meetings , but tireless and in the end , right . He thanked Leclerc , thanked him warmly , for the privilege of knowing these men , for the excitement of this mission ; for the opportunity to advance from the uncertainty of the past toward experience and maturity , to become a man , shoulder to shoulder with the others , tempered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precision of command , which made orderout of the anarchy of his heart . He imagined that when Anthony grew up , he too might be led into those dowdy corridors and be presented to old Pine , who with tears in his eyes would stand up in his box and warmly grasp the child 's tender hand . It was a scene in which Sarah played no part . Avery lightly touched a corner of the long envelope in his inside pocket . It contained his money : two hundred pounds in a blue envelope with the Government crest . He had heard of people in the war sewing such things into the lining of their clothes , and he rather wished they had done that for him . It was a childish conceit , he knew ; he even smiled to discover himself given to such fancies . He remembered Smiley that morning ; in retrospect he was just a little frightened of Smiley . And he remembered the child at the door . A man must steel himself against sentiment . " Your husband did a very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not tell you the details . I am sure that he died very gallantly . " 91THE LOOKING GLASS WARHer mouth was stained and ugly . Leclerc had never seen anyone cry so much ; it was like a wound that would not close . " What do you mean , gallantly ? " She blinked . " We 're not fighting a war . That 's finished , all that fancy talk . He 's dead , " she said stupidly , and buried her face in her crooked arm , slouching across the dining room table like a puppet abandoned . The child was staring from a corner . " I trust , " Leclerc said , " that I have your permission to apply for a pension . You must leave all that to us . The sooner we take care of it the better . A pension , " he declared , as if it were the maxim of his house , " can make a lot of difference . " The Consul was waiting beside the Immigration Officer ; he came forward without a smile as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avery ? " he asked . Avery had the impression of a tall man in a trilby and a dark overcoat , red-faced and severe . They shook hands . " You 're the British Consul . Mr. Sutherland . " " H. M. Consul , actually , " he replied a little tartly . " There 's a difference , you know . " Ile spoke with a Scottish accent . " How did you know my name ? " They walked together toward the main entrance . It was all very simple . Avery noticed the girl at the desk ; fair and rather pretty . " It 's kind of you to come all this way , " Avery said . " It 's only three miles from the town . " They got into the car . " He was killed just up the road , " said Sutherland . " Do you want to see the spot ? " " I might as well . To tell my mother . " He was wearing a black tie. 92Avery 's Run " Your name is Avery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; you saw my passport at the desk . " Sutherlanddid n't like that , and Avery rather wished he had n't said it . He started the engine . They were about to pull into the center of the road when a Citroen swung out and overtook them . " Damn fool , " Sutherland snapped . " Roads are like ice . One of these pilots , I suppose . No idea of speed . " They could see a peaked cap silhouetted against the windshield as the car hurried down the long road across the dunes , throwingup a small cloud of snow behind it . " Where do you come from ? " he asked . " London . " Sutherland pointed straight ahead : " That 's where your brother died . Up there on the brow . The police reckon the driver must have been tight . They 're very hot on drunken driving here , you know . " It sounded like a warning . Avery stared at the flat reaches of snowbound country on either side and thought of lonely , English Taylor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cold . " We 'll go to the police afterward , " said Sutherland . " They 're expecting us . They 'll tell you all the details . Have you booked yourself a room here ? " " No . " As they reached the top of the rise Sutherland said with grudging deference , " It was just here if you want to get out . " " It 's all right . " Sutherland accelerated a little as if he wanted to get away from the place . " Your brother was walking to the hotel . The Regina , just here . There was no taxi . " They descended the slope on the 93THE LOOKING GLASS WAR Avery 's Runother side ; Avery caught sight of the long lights of a hotel across the valley . " No distance at all , really , " Sutherland commented . " He 'd have done it in fifteen minutes . Less . Where does your mother live ? " The question took Avery by surprise . " Woodbridge , in Suffolk . " There was a by-election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into his head , though he had no interest in politics . " Why did n't he put her down ? " " I 'm sorry , I do n't understand . " " As next of kin . Why did n't Malherbe put his mother down instead of you ? " Perhaps it was not meant as a serious question ; perhaps he just wanted to keep Avery talking because he was upset ; nevertheless , it was unnerving . He was still strung up from the journey , he wanted to be taken for granted , not subjected to this interrogation . He realized , too , that he had not sufficiently worked out the supposed relationship between Taylor and himself . What had Leclerc written in the teleprint ; half brother or stepbrother ? Hastily he tried to visualize a train of family events , death , remarriage or estrangement , which would lead him to the answer to Sutherland 's question . " There 's the hotel , " the Consul said suddenly , and then , " It 's nothing to do with me , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Resentment had become a habit of speech with Sutherland , a philosophy . He spoke as if everything he said were the contradiction of a popular view . " She 's old , " Avery replied at last . " It 's a question of protectingher from shock . I expect that 's what he had in mind when he filled in his passport application . She 's been ill ; a94bad heart . She 's had an operation . " It sounded very childish . " Ah . " They had reached the outskirts of the town . " There has to be a postmortem , " Sutherland said . " It 's the law here , I 'm afraid , in the case of violent death . " Leclerc was going to be angry about that . Sutherland con- tinued , " For us , it makes the formalities more complicated . The Criminal Police take over the body until the postmortem is complete . I asked them to be quick , but one ca n't insist . " " Thanks . I thought I 'd have the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road into the market square , Avery asked casually , as if he had no personal interest in the out- come , " What about his effects ? I 'd better take them with me , had n't I ? " " I doubt whether the police will hand them over until they 've the go-ahead from the public prosecutor . The post- mortem report goes to him ; he gives clearance . Did your brother leave a will ? " " I 've no idea . " " You 'd not happen to know whether you 're an executor ? " " No . " Sutherland gave a dry , patient laugh . " I ca n't help feeling you 're a little premature . Next of kin is not quite the same as executor , " he said . " It gives you no legal rights , I 'm afraid , apart from the disposal of the body . " He paused , looking back over his seat while he reversed the car into a parking space . " Even if the police hand your brother 's effects over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until I 've had instructions from the Office , and they , " he continued quickly , for Avery was about to interrupt him , " wo n't issue such instructions to me until a grant of probate has been made or a Letter of Administration issued . But I can give95THE LOOKING GLASS WAR 1 Avery 's Runyou a death certificate , " he added consolingly , opening his door , " if the insurance companies require it . " He looked at Avery sideways , as if wondering whether he stood to inherit anything . " It 'll cost you five shillings for the Consular registrationand five shillings per certified copy . What was that you said ? " " Nothing . " Together they climbed the steps to the police station . " We 'll be seeing I nspeetor Peersen , " Sutherland explained . " He 's quite well disposed . You 'll kindly let me handle him . " " Of course . " " Ile 's been a lot of help with my D13S problems . " " Your what ? " " Distressed British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're a disgrace . I ) id your brother drink a lot , incidentally ? There 's sonic suggestion he was ? " " It 's possible , " Avery said . " I hardly knew him in the last few years . " They entered the building . Leclerc himself was walking carefully up the broad steps of the Ministry . It lay between Whitehall Gardens and the river ; the doorway was large and new , surrounded with that kind of fascist statnany which is admired by local authorities . Partly modernized , the building was guarded by sergeantsin red sashes and contained two escalators ; the one which descended was full , for it was half past five . " Under Secretary , " Leclerc began diffidently , " I shall have to ask the Minister for another overflight . " " You 'll be wasting your time , " he replied with satisfaction . " He was most apprehensive about the last one . He 's made a policy decision ; target like this . " 96The Under Secretary lightly touched the corners of his intrayas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have to think of something else , " he said . " Some other way . Is there no painless method ? " " None . I suppose we could try to stimulate a defection from the area . That 's a lengthy business . Leaflets , propagandabroadcasts , financial inducements . It worked well in the war . We would have to approach a lot of people . " " " It sounds a most improbable notion . " " Yes . Things are different now . " " What other ways are there then ? " he insisted . Leclerc smiled again , as if he would like to help a friend but could not work miracles . " An agent . A short-term operation . In and out : a week altogether perhaps . " The Under Secretary said , " But who could you find for a job like that ? These days ? " " Who indeed ? It 's a very long shot . " The Under Secretary 's room was large but dark , with rows of bound books . Modernization had encroached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the contemporary style , but there the process had stopped . They could wait till he retired to do his room . A gas fire burned in the marble fireplace . On the wall hung an oil painting of a battle at sea . They could hear the sound of barges in the fog . It was an oddly maritime atmosphere . " Kalkstadt 's pretty close to the border , " Leclerc suggested . " We would n't have to use a scheduled airline . We could do a training flight , lose our way . It 's been done before . " " Precisely , " said the Under Secretary ; then : " This man of yours who died . " " Taylor ? " " I 'm not concerned with names . He was murdered , was he ? " 97THE LOOKING GLASS WAR " There 's no proof , " Leclerc said . " But you assume it ? " Leclerc smiled patiently . " I think we both know , Under Secretary , that it is very dangerous to make broad assumptionswhen decisions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overflight . " The Under Secretary colored . " I told you it 's out of the question . No ! Does that make it clear ? We were talking of alternatives . " " There 's one alternative , I suppose , which would scarcely touch on my Department . Its more a matter for yourselves and the Foreign Office . " " Oh ? " " Drop a hint to the London newspapers . Stimulate publicity . Print the photographs . " " And ? " " Watch them . Watch the East Lerman and Soviet diplomacy , watch their communications . Throw a stone into the nest and see what comes out . " " I can tell you exactly what would come out . A protest from the Americans that would ring through these corridors for another twenty years . " " Of course . I was forgetting that . " " Then you 're very lucky . You suggested putting an agent in . " Only tentatively . We 've no one in mind . " " Look , " said the Under Secretary , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister 's position is very simple . You have produced a report . I f it is true , it alters our entire defense position . In fact it alters everything . I detest sensation , so does the Minister . Having put up the hare , the least you can do is have a shot at it . " Leclerc said , " If I found a man there 's the problem of 98Avery 's Runresources . Money , training and equipment . Extra staff perhaps . Transport . Whereas an overflight . . . " " Why do you raise so many difficulties ? I understood you people existed for this kind of thing . " " We have the expertise , Under Secretary . But I cut down , you know . I have cut down a lot . Some of our functions have lapsed : one must be honest . I have never tried to put the clock back . This is , after all " ? a delicate smile ? " a slightly anachronistic situation . " The Under Secretary glanced out of the window at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemporary to me . Rockets and that kind of thing . I do n't think the Minister considers it anachro-nistic . " " I 'm not referring to the target but the method of attack : it would have to be a crash operation at the border . That has scarcely been done since the war . Although it is a form of clandestine warfare with which my Department is traditionallyat home . Or used to be . " " What are you getting at ? " " I 'm only thinking aloud , Under Secretary . I wonder whether the Circus might not be better equipped to deal with this . Perhaps you should approach Control . I can promisehim the support of my armaments people . " " You mean you do n't think you can handle it ? " " Not with my existing organization . Control can . As long , that is , as the Minister does n't mind bringing in another Department . Two , really . I did n't realize you were so worried about publicity . " " Two ? " " Control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's his duty . Just as I inform you . And from then on , we must accept that it will be their headache . " 99THE LOOKING GLASS WAR " If those people know , " the Under Secretary said with contempt , " it 'll be round every damned club by tomorrow . " " There is that danger , " Leclerc conceded . " More particularly , I wonder whether the Circus has the military skills . A rocket site is a complicated affair : launch pads , blast shields , cable troughs ; all these things require proper processing and evaluation . Control and I could combine forces , I suppose ? " " That 's out of the question . You people make poor bedfellows . Even if you succeeded in cooperating , it would be against policy : no monolith . " " Ah yes . Of course . " " Assume you do it yourself , then ; assume you find a man . What would that involve ? " " A supplementary estimate . Immediate resources . Extra staff . A training establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife again . " And some help from Control . . . we could obtain that under a pretext . " A foghorn echoed mournfully across the water . " If it 's the only way ... " " Perhaps you 'd put it to the Minister , " Leclerc suggested . Silence . Leclerc continued , " In practical terms we need the best part of thirty thousand pounds . " " Accountable ? " " Partially . I understood you wanted to be spared details . " " Except where the Treasury 's concerned . I suggest that you make a memo about costs . " " Very well . Just an outline . " The silence returned . " That is hardly a large sum when set against the risk , " the Under Secretary said , consoling himself . " The potential risk . We want to clarify . I do n't pretend to be convinced . Merely suspicious , heavily suspicious . " He 100Avery 's Runcould n't resist adding , " The Circus would ask twice as much . They 're very free with money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our protection ? " " And a man . But I must find him for myself . " A small laugh . The Under Secretary said abruptly , " There are certain details the Minister will not want to know . You realize that ? " " Of course . I imagine you will do most of the talking . " " I imagine the Minister will . You 've succeeded in worrying him a good deal . " This time Leclerc remarked with impish piety , " We should never do that to our master ; our common master . " The Under Secretary did not seem to feel they had one . They stood up . " Incidentally , " Leclerc said , " Mrs. Taylor 's pension . I 'm making an application to the Treasury . They feel the Ministershould sign it . " " Why , for God 's sake ? " " It 's a question of whether he was killed in action . " The Under Secretary froze . " That is most presumptuous . You 're asking for Ministerial confirmation that Taylor was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pension , " Leclerc protested gravely . " He was one of my best men . " " Of course . They always are . " The Minister did not look up as they came in . But the Police Inspector rose from his chair , a short , plump man with a shaven neck . He wore plain clothes . Avery supposed him to be a detective . He shook their hands with an air of professional bereavement , sat them in modern chairs with teak arms and offered cigars out of a tin . They101THE LOOKING GLASS WARdeclined , so he lit one himself and used it thereafter both as a prolongation of his short fingers when making gestures of emphasis , and as a drawing instrument to describe in the smoke-filled air objects of which he was speaking . He deferredfrequently to Avery 's grief by thrusting his chin downwardinto his collar and casting from the shadow of his loweredeyebrows confiding looks of sympathy . First he related the circumstances of the accident , praised in tiresome detail the efforts of the police to track down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Police , whose anglophilia was a byword , and stated his own convictionthat the guilty man would be found out and punished with the full severity of Finnish law . He dwelt for some time on his own admiration of the British , his affection for the Queen and Sir Winston Churchill , the charms of Finnish neutrality , and finally he came to the body . The postmortem , he was proud to say , was complete , and Mr. Public Prosecutor ( his own words ) had declared that the circumstances of Mr. Malherbe 's death gave no grounds for suspicion despite the presence of a considerable amount of alcohol in the blood . The barman at the airport accounted for five glasses of Steinhager . He turned to Sutherland . " Does he want to see his brother ? " he inquired , thinking it apparently a delicacy to refer the question to a third party . Sutherland was embarrassed . " That 's up to Mr. Avery , " he said , as if the matter were outside his competence . They both looked at Avery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There is one difficulty . About the identification , " Peersen said . " Identification ? " Avery repeated . " Of my brother ? " 102Avery 's Run " You saw his passport , " Sutherland put in , " before you sent it up to me . What 's the difficulty ? " The policeman nodded . " Yes , yes . " Opening a drawer , he took out a handful of letters , a wallet and some photographs . " His name was Malherbe , " he said . He spoke fluent Englishwith a heavy American accent which somehow suited the cigar . " His passport was Malherbe . It was a good passport , was n't it ? " Peersen glanced at Sutherland . For a second , Avery thought he detected in Sutherland 's clouded face a certain honest hesitation . " Of course . " Peersen began to sort through the letters , putting some in a file before him and returning others to the drawer . Every now and then , as he added to the pile , he muttered : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes . " Avery could feel the sweat running down his body ; it drenched his clasped hands . " And your brother 's name was Malherbe ? " he asked again , when he had finished his sorting . Avery nodded . " Of course . " Peersen smiled . " Not of course , " he said , pointing his cigarand nodding in a friendly way as if he were making a debating point . " All his possessions , his letters , his clothes , driving license , all belong to Mr. Taylor . You know anythingof Taylor ? " A dreadful block was forming in Avery 's mind . The envelope , what should he do with the envelope ? Go to the lavatory , destroy it now before it was too late ? He doubted whether it would work : the envelope was stiff and shiny . Even if he tore it , the pieces would float . He was aware of Peersen and Sutherland looking at him , waiting for him to speak , and all he could think of was the envelope weighing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to say , " No , I do n't . My brother and I . . . " Stepbrother or half brother ? " My brother and I did not have much to do with one another . He was older . We did n't really grow up together . He had a lot of different jobs , he could never quite settle down to anything . Perhaps this Tay- for was a friend of his . . . who . . . " Avery shrugged , bravely trying to imply that Malherbe had been something of a mystery to him also . " How old are you ? " Peersen asked . His respect for the bereaved seemed to he dwindling . " Thirty-two . " " And Malherbe ? " he threw out conversationally . " He was how many years older , please ? " Sutherland and Peersen had seen his passport and knew his age . One remembers the age of people who die . Only Avery , his brother , had no idea how old the dead man was . " Twelve , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did he have to say so much ? Peersen raised his eyebrows . " Only forty-four ? Then the passport is wrong as well . " Peersen turned to Sutherland , poked his cigar toward the door at the far end of the room and said happily , as if he had ended an old argument between friends , " Now you are seeing why I have a problem about identification . " Sutherland was looking very angry . " It would be nice if Mr. Avery looked at the body , " Peer- sen suggested . " Then we can be sure . " Sutherland said , " Inspector Peersen . The identity of Mr. Malherbe has been established from his passport . The For- eign Office in London has ascertained that Mr. Avery 's name was quoted by Mr. Malherbe as his next of kin . You tell me there is nothing suspicious about the circumstances of his death . The customary procedure is now for you to release104 his effects to me for custody pending the completion of formalitiesin the United Kingdom . Mr. Avery may presumably take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deliberate . He extracted the remainder of Taylor 's papers from the steel drawer of his desk , added them to the pile already in front of him . He telephoned somebody and spoke in Finnish . After some minutes an orderlybrought in an old leather suitcase with an inventory which Sutherland signed . Throughout all this , neither Avery nor Sutherland exchanged a word with the Inspector . Peersen accompanied them all the way to the front door . Sutherland insisted on carrying the suitcase and papers himself . They went to the car . Avery waited for Sutherland to speak , but he said nothing . They drove for about ten minutes . The town was poorly lit . Avery noticed there was chemical on the road , in two lanes . The crown and gutters were still covered with snow . He was reminded of riding in the Mall , a thing he had never done . The streetlamps were neon , shedding a sickly light which seemed to shrink before the gathering darkness . Now and then Avery was aware of steep timbered roofs , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a policeman . Occasionally he stole a glance through the rear window . CHAPTER V I IOODFORD stood in the corridor smoking his pipe , grinning at the staff as they left . It was his hour of magic . The mornings were different . Tradition demandedthat the junior staff arrive at half past nine ; officer grades at ten or quarter past . Theoretically , senior members of the Department stayed late in the evening , clearing their papers . A gentleman , Leclerc would say , never watched the clock . The custom dated from the war , when officers spent the early hours of the morning debriefing reconnaissance pilotsback from a run , or the late hours of the night dispatchingan agent . The junior staff had worked shift in those days , but not the officers , who came and went as their work allowed . Now tradition fulfilled a different purpose . Now there were days , often weeks , when Woodford and his colleaguesscarcely knew how to fill the time until five-thirty ; all but Haldane , who supported on his stooping shoulders the Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were never submitted , bicker gently among themselves about leave , duty rosters and the quality106Avery 's Runof their official furniture ; give excessive attention to the problems of their section staff . Berry , the cipher clerk , came into the corridor , stooped and put on his bicycle clips . " How 's the missus , Berry ? " Woodford asked . A man must keep his finger on the pulse . " Doing very nicely , thank you , sir . " He stood up , ran a comb through his hair . " Shocking about Wilf Taylor , sir . " " Shocking . He was a good scout . " " Mr. Haldane 's locking up Registry , sir . He 's working late . " " Is he ? Well , we all have our hands full just now . " Berry lowered his voice . " And the boss is sleeping in , sir . Quite a crisis , really . I hear he 's gone to see the Minister . They sent a car for him . " " Good night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfaction , and began sauntering along the passage . The illumination in Haldane 's room came from an adjustablereading lamp . It threw a brief , intense beam on to the file in front of him , touching the contours of his face and hands . " Working late ? " Woodford inquired . Haldane pushed one file into his out-tray and picked up another . " Wonder how young Avery 's faring ; he 'll do well , that boy . I hear the Boss is n't back yet . Must be a long session . " As he spoke , Woodford settled himself in the leather armchair . It was Haldane 's own , he had brought it from his flat and sat in it to do his crossword puzzle after luncheon . " Why should he do well ? There is no particular precedent , " Haldane said , without looking up. 107THE LOOKING GLASS WAR " How did Clarkie get on with Taylor 's wife ? " Woodford now asked . " How 'd she take it ? " Haldane sighed and put his file aside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know , " he said . " You did n't hear how she took it ? He did n't tell you ? " Woodford always spoke a little louder than necessary , for he was used to competing with his wife . " I 've really no idea . IIe went alone , I understand . Leclerc prefers to keep these things to himself . " " I thought perhaps with you . . . " Haldane shook his head . Only Avery , " he muttered . " It 's a big thing , this , is n't it , Adrian . . . could be ? " " It could be . We shall see , " Haldane said gently . He wasnot always unkind toward Woodford . " Anything new on the Taylor front ? " Woodford inquired . " The Air Attache at Helsinki has located Lansen . He confirms that he handed Taylor the film . Apparently the Russiansintercepted him over Kalkstadt ; two MIGs . They buzzed him , then let him go . " " God , " said Woodford stupidly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind ; it 's consistent with what we know . If they declare the area closed why should n't they patrol it ? They probably closed it for maneuvers , ground-air exercises . Why did n't they force Lansen down ? The whole thing is entirely inconclusive . " Leclerc was standing in the doorway . He had put on a clean collar for the Minister and a black tie for Taylor . " I came by car , " he said . " They 've given us one from the Ministry pool on indefinite loan . The Minister was quite distressedto hear we had n't one . It 's a Humber , chauffeurdrivenlike Control 's . They tell me the chauffeur is a secure sort of person . " He looked at Haldane . " I 've decided to form Special Section , Adrian .

The usual program : wireless , weapon training , ciphers , observation , unarmed combat and cover . Adrian , we 'll need a house . Perhaps Avery could go into that when he comes back . I 'll approach Control about documentation ; the forgers all went over to him . We 'll want frontier records for the Lubeck area , refugee reports , details of minefields and obstructions . " He glanced at his watch . " Adrian , shall we have a word ? " " Tell me one thing , " Haldane said . " How much does the Circus know about this ? " " Whatever we choose to tell them . Why ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Whitehall . " " Possibly . " " They know Avery 's picking up a film in Finland . They may very well have noticed the Air Safety Center report on Lansen 's plane . They have a way of noticing things .... " " Well ? " " So it is n't only a question of what we tell them , is it ? " " You 'll come to tomorrow 's meeting ? " Leclerc asked a littlepathetically . " I think I have the meat of my instructions . If you have no objection I would like to make one or two inquiries . This evening and tomorrow perhaps . " Leclerc , bewildered , said , " Excellent . Can we help you ? " 109TIIE LOOKING GLASS WAR Avery 's Run " Perhaps I might have the use of your car for an hour ? " " Of course . I want us all to use i  --  o our common benefit .

" The Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a Papal blessing , there were degrees of authenticity in a Ministerial signature . " Then you 'll do it , Adrian ? You 'll take the job ? " Haldane might not have heard . IIe had reopened the file and was looking curiously at the photograph of a Polish boy who had fought the Germans twenty years ago . It was a young , strict face ; humorless . It seemed to be concerned not with living but with survival . " Why , Adrian , " Leclerc cried with sudden relief . " You 've taken the second vow ! " Reluctantly Haldane smiled , as if the phrase had called to mind something he had thought forgotten . " He seems to have a talent for survival , " he observed , finally indicating the file . " Not an easy man to kill . " " As next of kin , " Sutherland began , " you have the right to state your wishes concerning the disposal of your brother 's body . " " Yes . " Sutherland 's house was a small building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these distinguished it , either externally or internally , from its model in the dormitoryareas of Aberdeen . As they walked down the drive , Avery caught sight of a middle-aged woman in the window . She wore an apron and was dusting something .

I shan't110keep you long . " He was telling Avery he need n't expect to stay to supper . " How do you propose to get him back to England ? " They sat down on either side of the desk . Behind Sutherland'shead hung a watercolor of mauve hills reflected in a Scottish loch . " I should like it flown home . " " You know that is an expensive business ? " " I should like him flown all the same . " " For burial ? " " Of course . " " It is n't of course at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " ? he said it in inverted commas now , but he would play the game to the end ?

One of the partners is English , married to a Swedishgirl . There is a substantial Swedish minority here . We do our best to support the British community . In the circumstances , I would prefer you to return to London as soon as you can . I suggest you empower me to use Barford . " " All right . " " As soon as he has taken over the body , I will provide him with your brother 's passport . He will have to obtain a medicalcertificate regarding the cause of death .

Barford will do all this very quickly . I shall see to that . IIe has some pull with the charter companies here . The sooner lie ? " " I understand . " " I 'm not sure you do .

As regardsyour brother 's effects , I take it that whoever sent you wished you to recover these letters ? " He pushed them across the table . Avery muttered , " There was a film , an undeveloped film . " He put the letters in his pocket . Deliberately Sutherland extracted a copy of the inventory which he had signed at the police station , spread it out before him and ran his finger down the left-hand column suspiciously , as if he were checking someone else 's figures . " There is no film entered here . Was there a camera too ? " No . " Ah . " He saw Avery to the door . " You 'd better tell whoever sent you that Malherbe 's passport was not valid . The Foreign 112Avery 's RunOffice sent out a circular about a group of numbers , twentyodd . Your brother 's was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was about to report it when a Foreign Office teleprint arrived empowering you to take over Malherbe 's effects . " He gave a short laugh . He was very angry . " That was nonsense , of course . The Office would never have sent that on their own . They 've no authority , not unless you 'd Letters of Administration , and you could n't have got those in the middle of the night . Have you somewhere to stay ? The Regina 's quite good , near the airport . Out of town , too . I assume you can find your own way . I gather you people get excellent subsistence . " Avery made his way quickly down the drive , carrying in his memory the indelible image of Sutherland 's thin , bitter face set angrily against the Scottish hills . The wooden houses beside the road shone half white in the darkness like shadows around an operating table . Somewhere not far from Charing Cross , in the basementof one of those surprising eighteenth-century houses between Villiers Street and the river , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You reach it by descending a curving stone staircase . The railing , like the woodwork of the house in Blackfriars Road , is painted dark green and needs replacing . Its members are an odd selection . Some of a military kind , some in the teaching profession , others clerical ; others again from that no-man's-land of London society which lies between the bookmaker and the gentleman , presenting to those around them , and perhaps even to themselves , an imageof vacuous courage ; conversing in codes and phrases which a man with a sense of language can only listen to at a distance . It is a place of old faces and young bodies ; of young faces and old bodies ; where the tensions of war have become the tensions of peace , and voices are raised to113THE LOOKING GLASS WARdrown the silence , and glasses to drown the loneliness ; it is the place where the searchers meet , finding no one but each other and the comfort of a shared pain ; where the tired watchful eyes have no horizon to observe . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it here in one another , shyly like adolescents , thinking all the time of other people . From the war , none but the ( Ions were missing . It is a small place , run by a thin , dry man called Major Dell ; he has a moustache , and a tie with blue angels on a black background . Ile stands the first drink , and they buy him the others . I t is called the Alias Club , and Woodford was a member . It is open in the evenings . They come at about six , detachingthemselves with pleasure from the moving crowd , furtivebut determined , like men from out of town visiting a disreputable theatre . You notice first the things that are not there : no silver clips behind the bar , no visitors ' book nor list of membership ; no insignia , crest or title . Only on the whitewashed brick walls a few photographs hang , framed in decorative adhesive tape , like the photographs in Leclerc 's room . The faces are indistinct , some enlarged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with both ears showingaccording to the regulation ; some are women , a few of them attractive , with high square shoulders and long hair after the fashion of the war years . The men are wearing a variety of uniforms ; Free French and Poles mingle with their British comrades . Some are fliers . Of the English faces one or two , grown old , still haunt the club . When Woodford came in everyone looked around and Major Dell , much pleased , ordered his pint of beer . A florid , middle-aged man was talking about a sortie he once made over Belgium , but he stopped when he lost the attention of his audience . Avery 's Run " Hello , Woodie , " somebody said in surprise . " How 's the lady ? " " Fit . " Woodford smiled genially . " Fit . " He drank some beer . Cigarettes were passed around . Major Dell said , " Woodie'sjolly shifty tonight . " " I 'm looking for someone . It 's all a bit top secret . " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woodford glanced around the bar and asked quietly , a note of mystery in his voice , " What did Dad do in the war ? " A bewildered silence . They had been drinking for some time . " Kept Mum , of course , " said Major Dell uncertainly and they all laughed . Woodford laughed with them , savoring the conspiracy , relivingthe half-forgotten ritual of secret mess nights somewhere in England . " And where did he keep her ? " he demanded , still in the same confiding tone . This time two or three voices called in unison , " Under his blooming hat ! " They were louder , happier . " There was a man called Johnson , " Woodford continued quickly , " Jack Johnson . I 'm trying to find out what became of him . He was a trainer in wireless transmission ; one of the best . He was at Bovingdon first with Haldane until they moved him up to Oxford . " " Jack Johnson ! " the florid man cried excitedly . " The WT man ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson'sFair Deal in the Clapham Broadway , that 's the fellow . Drops in here from time to time . Amateur wireless enthusiast .

" That 's Jack ; he lives at Clapham . " THE LOOKING GLASS WAR 1 Avery 's Runthis one . " The conversation died . Woodford was real . He still did the job . " There was an unarmed combat man , a staff sergeant ; a Welshman . He was short too . " " Sounds like Sandy Lowe , " the florid man suggested . " Sandy , that 's him ! " They all turned to the florid man inadmiration . " He was a Taffy . Randy Sandy we called him . " " Of course , " said Woodford contentedly . " Now did n't hego off to some public school as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , holding a good deal back , playing it long because it was so secret . " That 's him , that 's Sandy ! " Woodford wrote it down , taking care because he had learned from experience that he tended to forget things which he entrusted to memory . As he was going , the Major asked , " How 's Clarkie ? " " Busy , " Woodford said . " Working himself to death , as al-ways . " " The boys talk about him a lot , you know . I wish he 'd come here now and then , give them a hell of a boost , you know . Perk them up . " " Tell me , " said Woodford . They were by the door . " Do you remember a fellow called Leiser ? Fred Leiser , a Pole ? Used to be with our lot . Ile was in the Holland show . " " Still alive ? " " Yes . " " Sony , " said the Major vaguely . " The foreigners have stopped coming ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the boys . " Closing the door behind him , Woodford stepped into the London night . He looked about him , loving all he sa  --  he Mother city in his rugged care . He walked slowly , an old athlete on an old track. 117The others took it up : that was the fellow and he ran this shop , at Clapham ; king of ham radio , been a ham before the war even when he was a kid ; yes , on the Broadway , hung out there for years ; must be worth a ransom . Liked to come into the club around Christmas time . Woodford , flushed with pleasure , ordered drinks . In the bustle that followed , Major Dell took Woodford gently by the arm and guided hint to the other end of the bar . " Woodie , is it true about old Wilf Taylor ? Has he really bought it ? " Woodford nodded , his face grave . " He was on a job . We think someone 's been a little bit naughty . " Major Dell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys . It would only worry ihcn- . Who 's caring for the Missus ? " " The Boss is taking that up now . It looks pretty hopeful . " " Good , " said the Major . " Good . " Iie nodded , patting Woodford 's arm in a gesture of consolation . " We 'll keep it from the boys , shall we ? " " Of course . " " He had one or two bills . Nothing very big . He liked to drop in Friday nights . " The Major 's accent slipped from time to time like a made-up tie . " Send them along . We 'll take care of those . " " There was a kid , was n't there ? A little girl ? " They were moving back to the bar . " I low old was she ? " " Eightish . Maybe more . " " He talked about her a lot , " said the Major . Somebody called , " IIey , Bruce , when are you chaps going to take another crack at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Took the wife to Italy in the summe  --  ull of arrogant Germans . " Woodford smiled . " Sooner than you think . Now let 's try 116CHAPTER V 1 1 1AVERY , on the other hand , walked fast . He was afraid . There is no terror so consistent , so elusiveto describe , as that which haunts a spy in a strange country . The glance of a taxi driver , the density of people in the street , the variety of official uniform  --  as he a policemanor a postman ? ? the obscurity of custom and languae , and the very noises which comprised the world into which Avery had moved contributed to a state of constant anxiety , which , like a nervous pain , became virulent now that he was alone . In the shortest time his spirit ranged between panic and cringing love , responding with unnatural gratitude to a kind glance or word . It was part of an effeminate dependenceupon those whom he deceived . Avery needed desperately to win from the uncaring faces around him the absolutionof a trusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : you do them no harm , you are their protector . He moved among them like a hunted man in search of rest and food. 118Avery 's RunHe took a cab to the hotel and asked for a room with a bath . They gave him the register to sign . He had actually put his pen to the page when he saw , not ten lines above , done in a laborious hand , the name Malherbe , broken in the middle as if the writer could not spell it . His eye followed the entry along the line : ADDRESS , London ; PROFESSION , Major(retired) ; DESTINATION , London . His last vanity , Avery thought , a false profession , a false rank , but little English Taylor had stolen a moment 's glory . Why not Colonel ? Or Admiral ? Why not give himself a peerage and an address in Park Lane ? Even when he dreamed , Taylor had known his limits . The concierge said , " The valet will take your luggage . " " I 'm sorry , " said Avery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man watched him curiously . He gave the valet a coin and it occurred to him as he did so that he had given him eight and six . He closed the bedroomdoor . For a while he sat on his bed . It was a carefully planned room but bleak and without sympathy . On the door was a notice in several languages warning against the perils of theft , and by the bed another which explained the financialdisadvantages of failing to breakfast in the hotel . There was a magazine about travel on the writing desk , and a Biblebound in black . There was a small bathroom , very clean , and a built-in wardrobe with one coat hanger . He had forgotten to bring a book . He had not anticipated having to endure leisure . He was cold and hungry . He thought he would have a bath . He ran it and undressed . He was about to get into the water when he remembered Taylor 's letters in his pocket . He put on a dressing gown , sat on the bed and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one from his mother , one from a friend which began Dear Old119THE LOOKING GLASS WARWilf , the rest from a woman . He was suddenly frightened of the letters : they were evidence . They could compromise him . He determined to burn them all . There was a second basin in the bedroom . He put all the papers into it and held a match to them . He had read somewhere that was the thing to do . There was a membership card for the Alias Club made out in Taylor 's name so he burned that too , then broke up the ash with his fingers and turned on the water ; it rose swiftly . The plug was a built-in metal affair operated by a lever between the taps . The sodden ash was packed beneath it . The basin was blocked . Be : looked for some instrument to probe under the lip of the plug . Ile tried his fountain pen but it was too fat , so he fetched the nail file . After repeated attempts he persuaded the ash into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown stain on the enamel . Ife rubbed it , first with his hand then with the scrubbing brush , but it would n't go . Enameldid n't stain like that , there must have been some qualityin the paper , tar or something . He went into the bathroom , looking vainly for a detergent . As he reentered his bedroom he became aware that it was filled with the smell of charred paper . He went quickly to the window and opened it . A blast of freezing wind swept over his naked limbs . Ile was gathering the dressing gown more closely about him when there was a knock on the door . Paralyzed with fear he stared at the door handle , heard another knock , called , watched the handle turn . It was the man from Reception . " Mr. Avery ? " " Yes ? " " I 'm sorry . We need your passport . For the police . " " Police . " 120Avery 's Run " It 's the customary procedure . " Avery had backed against the basin . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May I close the window ? " the man asked . " I was n't well . I wanted some fresh air . " " He found his passport and handed it over . As he did so , he saw the man 's gaze fixed upon the basin , on the brown mark and the small flakes which still clung to the sides . He wished as never before that he was back in England . The row of villas which lines Western Avenue is like a row of pink graves in a field of gray ; an architectural image of middle age . Their uniformity is the discipline of growing old , of dying without violence and living without success . They are houses which have got the better of their occupants ; whom they change at will , and do not change themselves . Furniture vans glide respectfully among them like hearses , discreetly removing the dead and introducing the living . Now and then some tenant will raise his hand , expendingpots of paint on the woodwork or labor on the garden , but his efforts no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the grass will grow its own way , like grass on a grave . Haldane dismissed the car and turned off the road toward South Park Gardens , a crescent five minutes from the Avenue . A school , a post office , four shops and a bank . He stooped a little as he walked ; a black briefcase hung from his thin hand . He made his way quietly along the pavement ; the tower of a modem church rose above the houses ; a clock struck seven . A grocer 's on the corner , new facade , self-service . He looked at the name : Smethwick . Inside , a youngish man in overalls was completing a pyramid of cereal foods. 121THE LOOKING GLASS WARHaldane rapped on the glass . The man shook his head and added a packet to the pyramid . He knocked again , sharply . The grocer came to the door . " I 'm not allowed to sell you anything , " he shouted , " so it 's no good knocking , is it ? " IIe noticed the briefcase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Haldane put his hand in his inside pocket and held something to the windo  --  card iii a cellophane wrapper like a season ticket . The grocer stared at it . Slowly he turned the key . " I want a word with you in private , " Haldane said , steppinginside . " I 've never seen one of those , " the grocer observed uneasily . " I suppose it 's all right . " " It 's quite all right . A security inquiry . Someone called Leiser , a Pole . I understand he worked here long ago . " " I 'll have to call my dad , " the grocer said . " I was only a kid then . " " I see , " said Haldane , as if he disliked the youth . It was nearly midnight when Avery rang Leclerc . He answeredstraightaway . Avery could imagine him sitting up in the steel bed , the Air Force blankets thrown back , his small , alert face anxious for the news . " It 's John , " he said cautiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . " IIe sounded cross that Avery had mentioned his name . " The deal 's off , I 'm afraid . They 're not interested . . . negative .

Avery did n't know what to say ; he just did n't know . He needed desperately to go on talking to Leclerc . He wanted122Avery 's Runto tell him about Sutherland 's contempt and the passport that was n't right . " The people here , the people I 'm negotiatingwith , are rather worried about the whole deal . " He waited . He wanted to call him by his name but he had no name for him . They did not use " Mister " in the Department ; the elder men addressed one another by their surnames and called the juniors by their Christian names . There was no established style of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you still there ? " and Leclerc replied , " Of course . Who 's worried ? What 's gone wrong ? " Avery thought : I could have called him " Director , " but that would have been insecure . " The representative here , the man who looks after our interests . . . he 's found out about the deal , " he said . " He seems to have guessed . " " You stressed it was highly confidential ? " " Yes , of course . " How could he ever explain about Suther-land ? " Good . We do n't want any trouble with the Foreign Office just now . " In an altered tone Leclerc continued , " Things are going very well over here , John , very well . When do you get back ? " " I 've got to cope with the . . . with bringing our friend home . There are a lot of formalities . It 's not as easy as you 'd think . " " Never mind . When will you be finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a car to meet you at Heathrow . A lot 's happened in the last few hours ; a lot of improvements . We need you badly . " Leclerc added , throwing him a coin , " And well done , John , well done indeed . " " All right . " He expected to sleep heavily that night , but after what123might have been an hour he woke , alert and watchful . He looked at his watch ; it was ten past one . Getting out of bed he went to the window and looked on to the snow-covered landscape , marked by the darker lines of the road which led to the airport ; he thought he could discern the little rise where Taylor had died . He was desolate and afraid . His mind was obsessed by confused visions : Taylor 's dreadful face , the face he so nearly saw , drained of blood , wide-eyed as if commu- nicating a crucial discovery ; Leclerc 's voice , filled with vul- nerable optimism ; the fat policeman , staring at him in envy , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He real- ized he was a person who did not take easily to solitude . Solitude saddened him , made him sentimental . He found himself thinking , for the first time since he had left the flat that morning , of Sarah and Anthony . Tears came suddenly to his tired eyes when he recalled his boy , the steel-rimmed spectacles like tiny irons ; he wanted to hear his voice , he wanted Sarah , and the familiarity of his home . Perhaps he could telephone the flat , speak to her mother , ask after her . But what if she were ill ? He had suffered enough pain that day , he had given enough of his energy , fear and invention . He had lived a nightmare : he could not be expected to ring her now . I3e went back to bed . Try as he might , he could not sleep . His eyelids were hot and heavy , his body deeply tired , but still he could not sleep . A wind rose , rattling the double windows ; now he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only to be wak- ened violently from his uneasy rest by the sound of crying , it might have been in the next room , it might have been Anthony , or it might have bee  --  ince he did not hear it properly , but only half knew in waking what kind of a sound it had bee  --  he metallic sobbing of a child 's doll. 124 And once , it was shortly before dawn , he heard a footfall outside his room , a single tread in the corridor , not imaginedbut real , and he lay in chill terror waiting for the handleof his door to turn or the peremptory knocking of InspectorPeersen 's men . As he strained his ears he swore he detected the faintest rustle of clothing , the subdued intake of human breath , like a tiny sigh ; then silence . Though he listened for minutes on end , he heard nothing more . Putting on the light , he went to the chair , felt in his jacket for his fountain pen . It was by the basin . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given him . Settling himself at the flimsy table in front of the window , he began writing a love letter to a girl , it might have been to Carol , he did not know . When at last morning came he destroyedit , tearing it into small pieces and flushing them down the lavatory . As he did so he caught sight of somethingwhite on the floor . It was a photograph of Taylor 's child carrying a doll ; she was wearing glasses , the kind Anthonywore . It must have been among his papers . He thought of destroying it but somehow he could n't . He slipped it into his pocket. was waiting at Heathrowas Avery knew he would be , standing on tiptoe , peering anxiouslybetween the heads of the waiting crowd . He had squared the customs somuehow , he must have got the Ministryto do it , and whew he saw Avery he came forward into the hall and guided hint in a managing way as if he were used to being spared formalities . This is the life we lead , Avery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same hurried , guilty mueetings ; we live outside the walls of the town , blackfriars from a ( lark house in Lambeth . He was desperately tired . lle wanted Sarah . He wanted to say I 'm sorry , make it up with her , get a new job , try again ; play with Anthony more . he felt ashamed . " I 'll just make a telephone call . Sarah was n't too well when I left . " " Do it from the Office , " Leclerc said . " Do you mind ? I have a meeting with Haldane in an hour . " Thinking he detecteda false note in Leclerc 's voice , Avery looked at him126suspiciously , but the other 's eyes were turned away toward the black Humber standing in the privilege car park . Leclerc let the driver open the door for him ; a silly muddle took place until Avery sat on his left as protocol apparently demanded . The driver seemed tired of waiting . There was no partition between him and themselves . " This is a change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded in a familiar way as if the acquisition were no longer new . " How are things ? " he asked , his mind elsewhere . " All right . There 's nothing the matter , is there ? With Sarah , I mean . " " Why should there be ? " " Blackfriars Road ? " the driver inquired without turning his head , as a sense of respect might have indicated . " Headquarters , yes please . " " There was a hell of a mess in Finland , " Avery observed brutally . " Our friend 's papers . . . Malherbe 's . . . were n't in order . The Foreign Office had canceled his passport . " " Malherbe ? Ah yes . You mean Taylor . We know all about that . It 's all right now . Just the usual jealousy . Control is rather upset about it , as a matter of fact . He sent round to apologize . We 've a lot of people on our side now , John , you 've no idea . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're the only one who 's seen it on the ground . " Seen what ? Avery wondered . They were together again . The same intensity , the same physical unease , the same absences . As Leclerc turned to him Avery thought for one sickening moment he was going to put a hand on his knee . " You 're tired , John , I can tell . I know how it feels . Never min  --  ou 're back with us now . Listen , I 've good news for you . The Ministry 's waked up to us in a big way . We 're to form a special operational unit to mount the next phase . " 127THE LOOKING GLASS WAR " Next phase ? " " Of course . The man I mentioned to you . We ca n't leave things as they are . We 're clarifiers , John , not simply collators . I 've revived Special Section ; do you know what that is ? " " Haldane ran it during the war ; training ? " Leclerc interrupted quickly for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he 's going to run it again now . I 've decided you 're to work with him . You 're the two best brains I 've got . " A sideways glance . Leclerc had altered . There was a new quality to his bearing , something more than optimism or hope . When Avery had seen him last he had seemed to be living against adversity ; now he had a freshness about him , a purpose , which was either new or very old . " And Haldane accepted ? " " I told you . Ile 's working night and day . You forget , Adrian 's a professional . A real technician . Old heads are the best for a job like this . With one or two young heads among them . " Avery said , " I want to talk to you about the whole operation . . . about Finland . I 'll come to your office after I 've rung Sarah . " " Come straightaway , then I can put you in the picture . " " I 'll phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Leclerc was trying to keep him from communicating with Sarah . " She is all right , is n't she ? " " So far as I know . Why do you ask ? " Leclerc went on , charming him : " Glad to be hack , John ? " " Yes , of course . " He sank back into the cushions of the car . Leclerc , noticinghis hostility , abandoned him for a time ; Avery turned his128Avery 's Runattention to the road and the pink , healthy villas drifting past in the light rain . Leclerc was talking again , his committee voice . " I want you to start straightaway . Tomorrow if you can . We 've got your room ready . There 's a lot to be done . This man : Haldane has him in play . We should hear something when we get home . From now on you 're Adrian 's creature . I trust that pleases you . Our masters have agreed to provide you with a special Ministry pass . The same kind of thing that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leclerc 's habit of speech ; there were times when he resorted entirely to oblique allusion , offering a raw material which the consumer , not the purveyor , must refine . " I want to talk to you about the whole thing . When I 've rung Sarah . " " That 's right , " Leclerc replied nicely , " come and talk to me about it . Why not come now ? " He looked at Avery , offeringhis whole face ; a thing without depth , a moon with one side . " You 've done well , " he said generously . " I hope you 'll keep it up . " They entered London . " We 're getting some help from the Circus , " he added . " They seem to be quite willing . They do n't know the whole picture of course . The Minister was very firm on that point . " They passed down Lambeth Road , where the God of Battlespresides ; the Imperial War Museum at one end , schools the other , hospitals in-between ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not tell who lives there . The houses are too many for the people , the schools too large for the children . The hospitals may be full , but the blinds are drawn . Dust hangs everywhere , like the dust of war .

It is a road which people seem to have left often . The few who returned brought something of the living world , according to their voyages . One a piece of field , another a broken Regency terrace , a warehouse or dumping yard ; or a pub called the Flowers of the Forest . It is a road filled with faithful institutions . Over one presidesour Lady of Consolation , over another , Archbishop Amigo . Whatever is not hospital , school , pub or seminary is ( lead , and the ( lust has got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . Avery looked into it every day on the way to the office ; the toys were rusting on the shelves . The window looked dirtier than ever ; the lower part was striped with children 's fingermarks . There is a place that mends your teeth while you wait . Ile glimpsed them now from the car , counting them off as they drove past , wondering whether he would ever see them again as a member of the Department . There are warehouses with barbed wire across their gates , and factories which produce nothing . In one of them a bell rang but no one heard . There is a broken wall with posters on it . You are Somebody today in the Regular Army . They rounded Saint George 's Circus and entered Blackfriars Road for the home run . As they approached the building , Avery sensed that things had changed . For a moment he imagined that the very grass on the wretched bit of lawn had thickened and revived during his brief absence ; that the concrete steps leading to the front door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were now clean and inviting . Somehow he knew , before he entered the building at all , that a new spirit had infected the Department. 130It had reached the most humble members of the staff . Pine , impressed no doubt by the black staff car and the suddenpassage of busy people , looked spruce and alert . For once he said nothing about cricket scores . The staircase was daubed with wax polish . In the corridor they met Woodford . He was in a hurry . He was carrying a couple of files with red caution notices on the cover . " Hullo , John ! You 've landed safely , then ? Good party ? " He really did seem pleased to see him . " Sarah all right now ? " " He 's done well , " said Leclerc quickly . " He had a very difficult run . " " Ah yes ; poor Taylor . We shall need you in the new section . Your wife will have to spare you for a week or two . " " What was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightened . He hastened down the corridor . Leclerc was calling but he took no notice . He entered his room and stopped dead . There was a second telephone on his desk , and a steel bed like Leclerc 's along the side wall . Beside the new telephone was a piece of military board with a list of emergency telephone numbers pinned to it . The numbers for use during the night were printed in red . On the back of the door hung a two-color poster depicting in profile the head of a man . Across his skull was written KEEP IT HERE , and across his mouth , DO N'T LET IT OUT HERE . It took him a moment or two to realize that the poster was an exhortationto security , and not some dreadful joke about Taylor . He lifted the receiver and waited . Carol came in with a tray of papers for signature . " How did it go ? " she asked . " The Boss seems pleased . " She was standing quite close to him. 131THE LOOKING GLASS WAR Avery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was n't among his things . I 'm going to resign ; I 've decided . What the hell 's wrong with this phone ? " " They probably do n't know you 're back . There 's a thing from Accounts about your claim for a taxi . They 've queried it . " " Taxi ? " " From your flat to the office . The night Taylor died . They say it 's too much . " " Look , go and stir up the exchange , will you , they must be fast asleep . " Sarah answered the telephone herself . " Oh , thank Cod it 's you . " Avery said yes , he had got in an hour ago . " Sarah , Iook , I 've had enough , I 'm going to tell Leclerc . " But before lie could finish she burst out , " John , for God 's sake , what have you been doing ? We had the police here , detectives ; they want to talk to you about a body that 's arrived at London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent from Finland on a false passport . " He closed his eyes . lie wanted to put down the receiver , he held it away from his ear but he still heard her voice , saying John , John .

" " Listen , " he said , " it 's all right . I 'll take care of it now . " " I told them about Taylor : I had to . " " Sarah ! " " What else could I do ? They thought I was a criminal or something ; they did n't believe me , John ! They asked how they could get hold of you ; I had to say I did n't know ; I did n't even know which country or which plane ; I was ill , 132John , I felt awful , I 've got this damn flu and I 'd forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the night , two of them . John , why did they come in the night ? " " What did you tell them ? For Christ 's sake , Sarah , what else did you say to them ? " " Do n't swear at me ! I should be swearing at you and your beastly Department ! I said you were doing something secret ; you 'd had to go abroad for the Departmen  --  ohn , I do n't even know its name ! ? that you 'd been rung in the night and you 'd gone away . I said it was about a courier called Taylor . " " You 're mad , " Avery shouted , " you 're absolutely mad ! I told you never to say ! " " But John , they were policemen ! There ca n't be any harm in telling them . " She was crying , he could hear the tears in her voice . " John , please come back . I 'm so frightened . You 've got to get out of this , go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do but ? " " I ca n't . It 's terribly big . More important than you can possibly understand . I 'm sorry , Sarah , I just ca n't leave the office . " He added savagely , a useful lie , " You may have wrecked the whole thing . " There was a very long silence . " Sarah , I 'll have to sort this out . I 'll ring you later . " When at last she answered he detected in her voice the same flat resignation with which she had sent him to pack his things . " You took the checkbook . I 've no money . " He told her he would send it around . " We 've got a car , " he added , " specially for this thing , chauffeur driven . " As he rang off he heard her say , " I thought you 'd got lots of cars . " He ran into Leclerc 's room . Haldane was standing behind the desk ; his coat still wet from the rain . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torn. 133THE LOOKING GLASS WAR Avery 's Run " Taylor 's body ! " he blurted out . " It 's at London Airport . You 've messed the whole thing up . They 've been on to Sarah ! In the middle of the night ! " " Wait ! " It was Haldane who spoke . " You have no business to come running in here , " lie declared furiously . " Just wait . " He did not care for Avery . He returned to the file , ignoring him . " None at all , " he muttered , adding to Leclerc : " Woodford has already had some success , I gather . Unarmed combat 's all right ; he 's heard of a wireless operator , one of the best . I remember him . The garage is called the King of Hearts ; it is clearly prosperous . We inquired at the bank ; they were quite helpful , if not specific . I le 's unmarried . He has a reputation for women ; the usual Polish style . No political interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He seems to be something of a nonentity . They say he 's a good mechanic . As for character ? " I lc shrugged . " What do we know about anybody ? " " But what did they say ? Good heavens , you ca n't be fifteen years in a community without leaving some impression . There was a grocer was n't ther  --  methwick ? ? he lived with them after the war . " Haldane allowed himself a smile . " They said he was a good worker and very polite . Everyone says he 's polite . They remember one thing only : he had a passion for hitting a tennis ball round their back yard . " " Did you take a look at the garage ? " " Certainly not . I did n't go near it . I propose to call there this evening . I do n't see that we have any other choice . After all , the man 's been on our cards for twenty years . " " Is there nothing more you can find out ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Circus . " 134 " Then let John Avery clear up the details . " Leclerc seemed to have forgotten Avery was in the room . " As for the Circus , I 'll deal with them myself . " His interest had been arrested by a new map on the wall , a town plan of Kalkstadt showing the church and railway station . Beside it hung an older map of eastern Europe . Rocket bases whose existence had already been confirmed were here related to the putativesite south of Rostock . Supply routes and chains of command , the order of battle of supporting arms , were indicatedwith lines of thin wool stretched between pins . A numberof these led to Kalkstadt . " It 's good , is n't it ? Sandford put it together last night , " Leclerc said . " He does that kind of thing rather well . " On his desk lay a new whitewood pointer like a giant bodkin threaded with a loop of barrister 's ribbon . He had a new telephone , green , smarter than Avery 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOT SECURE . For atime Haldane and Leclerc studied the map , referring now and then to a file of telegrams which Leclerc held open in both hands as a choirboy holds a psalter . Finally Leclerc turned to Avery and said , " Now , John . " They were waiting for him to speak . He could feel his anger dying . He wanted to hold on to it but it was slipping away . He wanted to cry out in indignation : how dare you involve my wife ? He wanted to lose control , but he could not . His eyes were on the map . " Well ? " " The police have been round to Sarah . They woke her in the middle of the night . Two men . Her mother was there . They came about the body at the airport : Taylor 's body . They knew the passport was phony and thought she was involved . They woke her up , " he repeated lamely. 135THE LOOKING GLASS WAR Avery 's Run " We know all about that . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't let me . The body 's been re-leased . " " It was wrong to drag Sarah in . " Haldane lifted his head quickly : " What do you mean by that ? " " We 're not competent to handle this kind of thing . " It sounded very impertinent . " We should n't be doing it . We ought to give it to the Circus . Smiley or someon  --  hey 're the people , not us . " Ile struggled on . " I do n't even believe that report . I do n't believe it 's true ! I would n't be surprised if that refugee never existed ; if Gorton made the whole thing up . I do n't believe Taylor was murdered . " " Is that all ? " Haldane demanded . He was very angry . " It 's not something I want to go on with . The operation , I mean . It is n't right . " He looked at the map and at Haldane , then laughed a little stupidly . " All the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a live one ! It 's easy here , in the dream factory . . . but they 're people out there , real people ! " Leclerc touched Haldane lightly on the arm as if to say he would handle this himself . He seemed undisturbed . He might almost have been gratified to recognize symptoms which he had previously diagnosed . " Go to your room , John , you 're suffering from strain . " " But what do I tell Sarah ? " He spoke with despair . " Tell her she wo n't be troubled anymore . Tell her it was a mistake . . . tell her whatever you like . Get some hot food and come back in an hour . These airline meals are useless . Then we 'll hear the rest of your news . " Leclerc was smiling , the same neat , bland smile with which he had stood among the dead fliers . As Avery reached the door he heard his name called softly , with affection : he stopped and looked back. 136Leclerc raised one hand from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they were standing . " I 'll tell you something , John . During the war we were in Baker Street . We had a cellar and the Ministry fixed it up as an emergency operations room . Adrian and I spent a lot of time down there . A lot of time . " " A glance at Haldane . " Rememberhow the oil lamp used to swing when the bombs fell ? We had to face situations where we had one rumor , John , no more . One indicator and we 'd take the risk . Send a man in , two if necessary , and maybe they would n't come back . Maybe there would n't be anything there . Rumors , a guess , a hunch one follows up ; it 's easy to forget what intelligenceconsists of : luck , and speculation . Here and there a windfall , here and there a scoop . Sometimes you stumbled on a thing like this : it could be very big , it could be a shadow . It may have been from a peasant in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King 's , but you 're left with a possibility you dare not discount . You get instructions : find a man , put him in . So we did . And many did n't come back . They were sent to resolve doubt , do n't you see ? We sent them because we did n't know . All of us have moments like this , John . Do n't think it 's always easy . " A reminiscent smile . " Often we had scruples like you . We had to overcome them . We used to call that the second vow . " He leaned against the desk , informally . " The second vow , " he repeated . " Now , John , if you want to wait until the bombs are falling , till people are dying in the street . . . " He was suddenlyserious , as if revealing his faith . " It 's a great deal harder , I know , in peacetime . It requires courage . Courage of a different kind . " Avery nodded . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with distaste. 137THE LOOKING GLASS WAR Avery 's Run " What the Director means , " he said acidly , " is that if you wish to stay in the Department and do the job , do it . If you wish to cultivate your emotions , go elsewhere and do so in peace . We are too old for your kind here . " Avery could still hear Sarah 's voice , see the rows of little houses hanging in the rain ; he tried to imagine his life withoutthe Department . Ile realized that it was too late , as it always had been , because he had gone to them for the little they could give him , and they had taken the little he had . Like a doubting cleric , he had felt that whatever his small heart contained was safely locked in the place of his retreat ; now it was gone . Ile looked at Leclerc , then at Haldane . They were his colleagues . Prisoners of silence , the three of them would work side by side , breaking the arid land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , needing each other , in a wilderness of abandoned faith . " Did you hear what I said ? " llaldane demanded . Avery muttered : " Sorry . " " You did n't fight in the war , John , " Leclerc said kindly . " You do n't understand how these things take people . You do n't understand what real duty is . " " I know , " said Avery . " I 'm sorry . I 'd like to borrow the car for an hour . . . send something round to Sarah , if that 's all right . " " Of course . " He realized he had forgotten Anthony 's present . " I 'm sorry , " he said again . " Incidentally= ? ' Leclerc opened a drawer of the desk and took out an envelope .

There was a signature in red ink . " Thanks . " " You 're safe with that , " Leclerc said . " The Minister signed it . He uses red ink , you know . It 's tradition . " He went back to his room . There were times when he confronted his own image as a man confronts an empty valley , and the vision propelled him forward again to experience , as despair compels us to extinction .

" You need n't wait . You have to take Mr. Leclerc to the Ministry . " He picked his way reluctantly over the tarmac , past the yellow petrol pumps and the advertisement shields rattling in the wind . It was evening ; there was rain about . The garagewas small but very smart ; showrooms one end , workshopsthe other , in the middle a tower where somebody lived . Swedish timber and open plan ; lights on the tower in the shape of a heart , changing color continuously . From somewhere came the whine of a metal lathe . Haldane went into the office . It was empty . There was a smell of rubber . He rang the bell and began coughing wretchedly . Sometimeswhen he coughed he held his chest , and his face betrayedthe submissiveness of a man familiar with pain . Calendarswith showgirls hung on the wall beside a small hand-143THE LOOKING GLASS WAR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which read , ST . CHRISTOPHER AND ALL HIS ANGELS , PLEASE PROTECT USFROM ROAD ACCIDENTS . F.L. At the window a budgerigar flutterednervously in its cage . The first drops of rain thumped lazily against the panes . A boy came in , about eighteen , his fingers black with engine oil . IIe wore overalls with a red heart sewn to the breast pocket with a crown above it . " Good evening , " said Ilaldane . " Forgive me . I 'm looking for an old acquaintance ; a friend . We knew one another long ago . A Mr. Leiser. h'red Leiser . I wondered if you had any idea . . . " " I 'll get him , " the boy said , and disappeared . Haldane waited patiently , looking at the calendars and wondering whether it was the boy or Leiser who had hung them there . The door opened a second time . It was Leiser . Haldane recognized him from his photograph . There was really very little change . The twenty years were not drawn in forceful lines but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discipline around the mouth . The light above him was diffuse and cast no shadow . It was a face which at first sight recorded nothing but loneliness . Its complexion was pale . " What can I do for you ? " Leiser asked . He stood almost at attention . " Hullo , I wonder if you remember me ? " Leiser looked at him as if he were being asked to name a price , blank but wary . " Sure it was me ? " " Yes . " " It must have been a long time ago , " he said at last . " I do n't often forget a face . " " Twenty years . " Haldane coughed apologetically . " In the war then , was it ? " 144He was a short man , very straight ; in build he was not unlike Leclerc . He might have been a waiter . His sleeves were rolled up a little way , there was a lot of hair on the forearms . His shirt was white and expensive ; a monogram on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good deal on his clothes . He wore a gold ring ; a golden wristband to his watch . He took great care of his appearance ; Haldane could smell the lotion on his skin . His long brown hair was full , the line along the forehead straight . Bulging a little at the sides , the hair was combed backwards . He wore no parting ; the effect was definitely Slay . Though very upright he had about him a certain swagger , a looseness of the hips and shoulders , which suggested a familiarity with the sea . It was here that any comparison with Leclerc abruptly ceased . He looked , despite himself , a practical man , handy in the house or starting the car on a cold day ; and he looked an innocent man , but traveled . He wore a tartan tie . " Surely you remember me ? " Haldane pleaded . Leiser stared at the thin cheeks , touched with points of high color , at the hanging , restless body and the gently stirringhands , and there passed across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he were identifying the remains of a friend . " You 're not Captain Hawkins , are you ? " " That 's right . " " God Christ , " said Leiser , without moving . " You 're the people who 've been asking about me . " " We 're looking for someone with your experience , a man like you . " " What do you want him for , sir ? " He still had n't moved . It was very hard to tell what he was thinking . His eyes were fixed on Haldane . " To do a job , one job . " 145THE LOOKING GLASS WAR Leiser 's RunLeiser smiled , as if it all came back to him . He nodded his head toward the window . " Over there ? " He meant somewherebeyond the rain . " Yes . " " What about getting back ? " " The usual rules . It 's up to the man in the field . The war rules . " He pushed his hands into his pockets , discovered cigarettesand a lighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You smoke ? " IIe gave himself a cigarette and lit it , his hands cupped around the flame as if there were a high wind . I le dropped the match on the floor for someone else to pick up . " God Christ , " he repeated , " twenty years . I was a kid in those days , just a kid . " Haldane said , " You do n't regret it , I trust . Shall we go and have a drink ? " IIe handed Leiser a card . It was newly printed : CAPTAIN A. I IAwKINS . Written underneath was a telephone number . Leiser read it and shrugged . " I do n't mind , " he said and fetched his coat . Another smile , incredulous this time . " But you 're wasting your time , Captain . " " Perhaps you know someone . Someone else from the war who might take it on . " " I do n't know a lot of people , " Leiser replied . He took a jacket from the peg and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the door , he opened it elaboratelyas if he valued formality . His hair was laid carefully upon itself like the wings of a bird . There was a pub on the other side of the avenue . They reached it by crossing a footbridge . The rush hour traffic thundered beneath them ; the cold , plump raindrops seemed to go with it . The bridge trembled to the drumming of the146cars . The pub was Tudor with new horse brasses and a ship 's bell very highly polished . Leiser asked for a White Lady . He never drank anything else , he said . " Stick to one drink , Captain , that 's my advice . Then you 'll be all right . Down the hatch . " " It 's got to he someone who knows the tricks , " Haldane observed . They sat in a corner near the fire . They might have been talking about trade . " It 's a very important job . They pay far more than in the war . " He gave a gaunt smile . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Still , money 's not everything , is it ? " A stiff phrase , borrowedfrom the English . " They remembered you . People whose names you 've forgotten , if you even knew them . " An unconvincing smile of reminiscence crossed his thin lips : it might have been years since he had lied . " You left quite an impression behind you , Fred ; there were n't many as good as you . Even after twenty years . " " They remember me then , the old crowd ? " He seemed grateful for that , but shy , as if it were not his place to be held in memory . " I was only a kid then , " he repeated . " Who 's there still , who 's left ? " Haldane , watching him , said , " I warned you , we play the same rules , Fred . Need to know , it 's all the same . " It was very strict . " God Christ , " Leiser declared . " All the same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bigger . " Haldane fetched another White Lady . " Take much interest in politics ? " Leiser lifted a clean hand and let it fall . " You know the way we are , " he said . " In Britain , you know . " His voice carried the slightly impertinent assumption that he was as good as Haldane. 147THE LOOKING GLASS WAR Leiser 's Run " I mean , " Haldane prompted , " in a broad sense . " He coughed his dusty cough . " After all , they took over your country , did n't they ? " Leiser said nothing . " What did you think of Cuba , for instance ? " Haldane did not smoke , but he had bought some cigarettesat the bar , the brand Leiser preferred . He removed the cellophane with his slim , aging fingers , and offered them across the table . Without waiting for an answer , he continued , " The point was , you see , in the Cuba thing the Americansknew . It was a matter of information . Then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't always do that . " lle gave another little laugh . " One wonders what they would have done without there . " " Yes , that 's right . " Ile nodded his head like a dummy . Haldane paid no attention . " They might have heel ) stuck , " Haldane suggested and sipped his whisky . " Are you married , by the way ? " Leiser grinned , held his hand out flat , tipped it briskly to left and right , like a loan talking about airplanes . " So , so , " he said . Ilis tartan tie was fastened to his shirt with a heavy gold pin in the shape of a riding crop against a horse 's head . It was very incongruous . " How about you , ( ; aptain ? " Haldane shook his head . " No , " Leiser observed thoughtfully , " no . " " Then there have been other occasions , " Haldane went on , " where very serious mistakes were made because they had n't the right information , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have people permanently everywhere . " " No , of course , " Leiser said politely . The bar was filling up . " I wonder whether you know of a different place where 148we might talk ? " Haldane inquired . " We could eat , chat about some of the old gang . Or have you another engagement ? " The lower classes eat early . Leiser glanced at his watch . " I 'm all right till eight , " he said . " You want to do something about that cough , sir . It can be dangerous , a cough like that . " The watch was of gold ; it had a black face and a compartment for indicating phases of the moon . The Under Secretary , similarly conscious of the time , was bored to be kept so late . " I think I mentioned to you , " Leclerc was saying , " that the Foreign Office has been awfully sticky about providing operational passports . They 've taken to consulting the Circus in every case . We have no status , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself unpleasant about these things ? they have only the vaguest notion of how we work . I wondered whether the best system might not be for my Departmentto route passport requisitions through your Private Office . That would save the bother of going to the Circus every time . " " What do you mean , sticky ? " " You will remember we sent poor Taylor out under another name . The Office revoked his operational passport a matter of hours before he left London . I fear the Circus made an administrative blunder . The passport which accompanied the body was therefore challenged on arrival in the United Kingdom . It gave us a lot of trouble . I had to send one of my best men to sort it out , " he lied . " I 'm sure that if the Minister insisted , Control would be quite agreeable to a new arrangement . " The Under Secretary jabbed a pencil at the door which149THE LOOKING GLASS WAR Leiser 's Runled to his Private Office . " Talk to them in there . Work something out . It sounds very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " De Lisle , " said Leclerc with satisfaction , " in General Department . He 's the Assistant . And Guillam at the Circus .

Wireless and that kind of thing . I propose to use a cover story for security reasons : a pretended training scheme is the most appropriate . " " Cover story ? All yes : a lie . You mentioned it . " Its a precalltion , 110 1Iu ) re . " You must do as you think fit . " " I imagined you would prefer the Circus not to know . You said yourself : no monolith . I have proceeded on that assumption .

" The Under Secretary wrinkled his nose very slightly , his hand on the Minister 's door . He was a churchman and dislikedirregular things . " What makes a man take on a job like that ? Not you ; him , I mean . " Leclerc shook his head in silence , as if the two of them 150were in close sympathy . " Heaven knows . It 's something we do n't even understand ourselves . " " What kind of person is he ? What sort of class ? Only generally , you appreciate . " " Intelligent . Self-educated . Polish extraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed relieved . " We 'll keep it gentle , shall we ? Do n't paint it too black . He loathes drama . I mean , any fool can see what the dangers are . " They went in . Haldane and Leiser took their places at a corner table , like early lovers in a coffee bar . It was one of those restaurantswhich rely on empty Chianti bottles for their charm and on very little else for their custom . It would be gone tomorrow , or the next day , and scarcely anyone would notice , but while it was there and new and full of hope , it was not at all bad . Leiser had steak , it seemed to be habit , and sat primly while he ate it , his elbows firmly at his sides . At first Haldane pretended to ignore the purpose of his visit . He talked badly about the war and the Department ; about operations he had half forgotten until that afternoon , when he had refreshed his memory from the files . He spoke ? no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He referred to the courses Leiser had attended ; had he kept up his interest in radio at all ? Well , no , as a matter of fact . How about unarmed combat ? There had n't been the opportunity , really . " You had one or two rough moments in the war , I remember , " Haldane prompted . " Did n't you have some trouble in Holland ? " They were back to vanity and old times ' sake . A stiff nod . " I had a spot of trouble , " he conceded . " I was younger then . " 151THE LOOKING GLASS WAR " What happened exactly ? " Leiser looked at Haldane , blinking , as if the other had waked him , then began to talk . It was one of those wartime stories which have been told with variations since war began , as remote from the neat little restaurant as hunger or poverty , less credible for being articulate . He seemed to tell it at second hand . It might have been a big fight he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had escaped , he had lived for days without food , he had killed , been taken into refugeand smuggled back to England . Ile told it well ; perhaps it was what the war meant to him now , perhaps it was true , but as with a Latin widow relating the manner of her husband'sdeath , the passion had gone out of his heart and into the telling . I le scenred to speak because he had been told to ; his affectations , unlike Leclerc 's , were designed less to impressothers than to protect himself . He seemed a very privateman whose speech was exploratory ; a man who had been a long time alone and had not reckoned with society ; poised , not sett led . I I is accent was good but exclusively foreign , lacking the slur and the elision which escapes even gifted imitators ; a voice familiar with its environment , but not at home there . Ilaldane listened courteously . When it was over he asked , " How did they pick you up in the first place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very great . " They never told me , " he said blankly , as if it were not proper to inquire . " Of course you are the man we need . You 've got the Germanbackground , if you understand me . You know them , do n't you ? You have the German experience . " " Only from the war , " Leiser said . They talked about the training school . " How 's that fat one ? George somebody . Little sad bloke . " 152Leiser 's Run " Oh . . . he 's well , thank you . " " He married a pretty girl . " He laughed obscenely , raising his right forearm in an Arab gesture of sexual prowess . " God Christ , " he said , laughing again . " Us little blokes ! Go for anything . " It was an extraordinary lapse . It seemed to be what Haldane had been waiting for . He watched him coolly for a long time . The silence became remarkable . Deliberately he stood up ; he seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this whole cheap , incompetent flirtation ; at these meaningless repetitive blasphemies and this squalid derision of a person of quality . " Do you mind not saying that ? George Smiley happens to be a friend of mine . " " He called the waiter and paid the bill , stalked quickly from the restaurant , leaving Leiser bewildered and alone , his White Lady held delicately in his hand , his brown eyes turned anxiously toward the doorway through which Haldanehad so abruptly vanished . Eventually he left , making his way back by the footbridge , slowly through the dark and the rain , staring down on the double alley of streetlights and the traffic passingbetween them . Across the road was his garage , the line of illuminated pumps , the tower crowned with its neon heart of sixty-watt bulbs alternating green and red . He entered the brightly lit office , said something to the boy , walked slowly upstairs toward the blare of music . Haldane waited till he had disappeared from sight , then hurried back to the restaurant to order a taxi . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dance music , sitting in his chair , drinking . " Christ , you 're late , " she said . " I 'm starving . " 153THE LOOKING GLASS WARHe kissed her . " You 've eaten , " she said . " I can smell the food . " " Just a snack , Bett . I had to . A man called ; we had a drink . " " Liar . " He smiled . " Come off it , Betty . We 've got a dinner date , remember ? " " What man ? " The flat was very clean . Curtains and carpets were flowered , the polished surfaces protected with lace . Everything was protected ; vases , lamps , ashtray , all were carefully guarded , as if Leiser expected nothing from nature but stark collision . He favored a suggestion of the antique : it was reflected in the scrolled woodwork of the furniture and the wrought iron of the lamp brackets . He had a mirror framed in gold and a picture made of fretwork and plaster ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he opened the cocktail cabinet it played a brief tune on a music box . He mixed himself a White Lady , carefully , like a man makingup medicine . She watched him , moving her hips to the record , holding her glass away to one side as if it were her partner 's hand , and the partner were not Leiser . " What man ? " she repeated . He stood at the window , straight-backed like a soldier . The flashing heart on the roof played over the houses , caught the staves of the bridge and quivered in the wet surface of the Avenue . Beyond the houses was the church , like a cinema with a spire , fluted brick with vents where the bells rang . Beyond the church was the sky . Sometimes he thought the church was all that remained , and the London sky was lit with the glow of a burning city . " Christ , you 're really gay tonight " 154Leiser 's RunThe church bells were recorded , much amplified to drown the noise of traffic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain was running harder against the road ; he could see it shading the beams of the car lights , dancing green and red on the tarmac . " Come on , Fred , dance . " " Just a minute , Bett . " " Oh , for Christ 's sake what 's the matter with you ? Have another drink and forget it . " He could hear her feet shuffling across the carpet to the music ; the tireless jingle of her charm bracelet . " Dance , for Christ 's sake . " She had a slurred way of talking , slackly dragging the last syllable of a sentence beyond its natural length ; it was the same calculated disenchantment with which she gave herself , sullenly , as if she were giving money , as if men had all the pleasure and women the pain . She stopped the record , careless as she pulled the arm . The needle scratched in the loudspeaker . " Look , what the hell goes on ? " " Nothing I tell you . I 've just had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called , somebody I used to know . " " I keep asking you : who ? Some woman , was n't it ? Some tart . " " No , Betty , it was a man . " She came to the window , nudging him indifferently . " What 's so bloody marvelous about the view anyway ? Just a lot of rotten little houses . You always said you hated them . Well , who was it ? " " He 's from one of the big companies . " " And they want you ? " " Yes . . . they want to make me an offer . " " Christ , who 'd want a bloody Pole ? " 155THE LOOKING GLASS WAR ' Leiser 's RunHe hardly stirred . " They do . " " Someone came to the bank , you know , asking about you . They all sat together in Mr. Dawnay 's office .

I thought you fancied it there . You can dance too ; you like that . Where do you want to go then ? " " With you ? For Christ 's sake ! Somewhere where there 's a bit of life , that 's all . " He stared at her . He was holding the door open . Suddenly he smiled . " O.K. Bett . It 's your night . Slip down and start the car , I 'll book a table . " He gave her the key . " I know a place , a real place . " " What the hell 's come over you now ? " " You can drive . We 'll have a night out . " He went to the telephone . It was shortly before eleven when Haldane returned to the Department . Leclerc and Avery were waiting for him . Carol was typing in the private office . " I thought you 'd be here earlier , " Leclerc said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't play . I think you 'd better try the next one yourself . It 's not my style anymore . " He seemed undisturbed . He sat down . They stared at him incredulously . " Did you offer money ? " Leclerc asked finally . " We have clearance for five thousand pounds . " 156 " Of course I offered money . I tell you he 's just not interested . He was a singularly unpleasant person . " " I 'm sorry . " He did n't say why . They could hear the tapping of Carol 's typewriter . Leclerc said , " Where do we go from here ? " " I have no idea . " He glanced restlessly at his watch . " There must be others , there must be . " " Not on our cards . Not with his qualifications . There are Belgians , Swedes , Frenchmen . But Leiser was the only Germanspeaker with technical experience . On paper , he 's the only one . " " Still young enough . Is that what you mean ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an old hand . We have n't the time to train a new man , nor the facilities . We 'd better ask the Circus . They 'll have someone . " " We ca n't do that , " Avery said . " What kind of man was he ? " Leclerc persisted , reluctant to abandon hope . " Common , in a Slav way . Small . He plays the Rittmeister . It 's most unattractive . " He was looking in his pockets for the bill . " He dresses like a bookie , but I suppose they all do that . Do I give this to you or Accounts ? " " Secure ? " " I do n't see why not . " " And you spoke about the urgency ? New loyalties and that kind of thing ? " " He found the old loyalties more attractive . " He put the bill on the table . " And politics . . . some of these exiles are very ... " " We spoke about politics . He 's not that sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' What do you expect him to do ?

" Leclerc cried , angeredby Haldane 's indifference . " You 're pleased , Adrian , I can see it in your face ! Good God , what about the Department ! Did n't that mean anything to him ? You do n't believe in it anymore , you do n't care ! You 're sneering at me ! " " Who of us does believe ? " asked Haldane with contempt . " You said yourself : we do the job . " " I believe , " Avery declared . Haldane was about to speak when the green telephone rang . " That will be the Ministry , " Leclerc said . " Now what do I tell them ? " I lalclane was watching him . He picked up the receiver , put it to his ear then handed it across the table . " It 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on green ? Somebody asking for Captain Hawkins .

Kindly be punctual , " and rang off . The light ii- Leclerc 's room seemed to ebb toward the thinly curtained window . The rain fell ceaselessly outside . " That was Leiser . Ile 's decided he 'll do the job . He wants to know whether we can find someone to take care of his garage while he 's away . " Leclerc looked at him in astonishment . Pleasure spread comically over his face . " You expected it ! " he cried . He stretched out his small hand . " I 'm sorry , Adrian . I misjudged you . I congratulate you warmly . " " Why did he accept ? " Avery asked excitedly . " What made him change his mind ? " " Why do agents ever do anything ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked old but inviolate , like a man158whose friends had already died . " Why do they consent or refuse , why do they lie or tell the truth ? Why do any of us ?

I assumehe means himself . " To Leclerc he added , " The war rules : that was right , was n't it ? " But Leclerc was dialing the Ministry . Avery went into the Private Office . Carol was standing up . " What 's going on ? " she said quickly . " What 's the excite-ment ? " " It 's Leiser . " Avery closed the door behind him . " He 's agreed to go . " He stretched out his arms to embrace her . It would be the first time . " Why ? " ? " Hatred of the Germans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is that a good thing ? " Avery grinned knowingly . " As long as we pay him more than the other side . " " Should n't you go back to your wife ? " she said sharply . " I ca n't believe you need to sleep here . " " It 's operational . " Avery went to his room . She did not say good night . Leiser put down the telephone . It was suddenly very quiet . The lights on the roof went out , leaving the room in darkness . He went quickly downstairs . He was frowning , as if his entire mental force were concentrated on the prospect of eating a second dinner. 159CHAPTER XITI WY chose Oxford as they had done in the war . The variety of nationalities and occupations , the constant coming and going of visiting academics and the resultant anonymity , the proximity of open country , all perfectlysuited their needs . Besides , it was a place they could understand . Tlie morning after Leiser had rung , Avery went ahead to find a house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken one for a month in the north of the town , a large Victorian affair with four bedrooms and a garden . It was very expensive . It was known in the Departmentas the Mayfly house and carded under Live Amenities . As soon as Haldane heard , he told Leiser . At Leiser 's suggestion it was agreed that he should put it about that he was attending a course in the Midlands . " Do n't give any details , " Haldane had said . " Have your mail sent poste restante to Coventry . We 'll get it picked up from there . " Leiser was pleased when he heard it was Oxford. 160Leiser 's RunLeclerc and Woodford had searched desperately for someone to run the garage in Leiser 's absence ; suddenly they thought of McCulloch . Leiser gave him power of attorney and spent a hasty morning showing him the ropes . " We 'll offer you some kind of guarantee in return , " Haldane said . " I do n't need it , " Leiser replied , explaining quite seriously . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leiser had telephoned his consent ; by Wednesday , preparations were sufficiently advanced for Leclercto convene a meeting of Special Section and outline his plans . Avery and Haldane were to be with Leiser in Oxford ; the two of them would leave the , following evening , by which time he understood that Haldane would be ready with his syllabus . Leiser would arrive in Oxford a day or two later , as soon as his own arrangements were complete . Haldane was to supervise his training , Avery to act as Haldane 's assistant . Woodford would remain in London . Among his tasks was that of consulting with the Ministry ( and Sandford of Research ) in order to assemble instructionalmaterial on the external specifications of short- and medium-range rockets , and thus provided come himself to Oxford . Leclerc had been tireless , now at the Minis-try to report on progress , now at the Treasury to argue the case for Taylor'swidow , now , with Woodford 's aid , engaging former instructorsin wireless transmission , photography and unarmed combat . Such time as remained to Leclerc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leiser was to be infiltrated into eastern Germany . At first he seemed to have no firm idea of how this was to be done . He talked vaguely of a sea operationfrom Denmark ; small fishing craft and a rubber dinghy to evade radar detection . He discussed illegal frontier cross-161THE LOOKING GLASS WAR Leiser 's Runing with Sandford and telegraphed Gorton for information on the border area round Lubeck . In veiled terms he even consulted the Circus . Control was remarkably helpful . All this took place in that atmosphere of heightened activityand optimism which Avery had observed on his return . Even those who were kept , supposedly , in ignorance of the operation were infected by the air of crisis . The little lunch group that gathered daily at a corner table of the Cadena cafe was alive with rumors and speculation . It was said , for instance , that a man named Johnson , known in the war as Jack Johnson , a wireless instructor , had been taken on to the strength of the Department . Accounts had paid him subsistencean  --  ust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a three-month contract for submission to the Treasury . Who ever heard , they asked , of a three-month contract ? Johnson had been concerned with the French drops during the war ; a senior girl remembered him . Berry , the cipher clerk , had asked Mr. Woodford what Johnson was up to ( Berry was always the cheeky one ) and Mr. Woodford had grinned and told him to mind his own business , but it was for an operation , he 'd said , a very secret one they were running in Europe . . . Northern Europe , as a matter of fact , and it might interest Berry to know that poor Taylor had not died in vain . There was now a ceaseless traffic of cars and Ministry messengersin the front drive ; Pine requested and received from another Government establishment a junior whom he treated with sovereign brutality . In some oblique way he had learned that Germany was the target , and the knowledgemade him diligent . It was even rumored among the local tradesmen that the Ministry House was changing hands ; private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Meals162were sent for at all hours , lights burned day and night ; the front door , hitherto permanently sealed for reasons of security , was opened ; and the sight of Leclerc with bowler hat and briefcase entering his black Humber became a familiar one in Blackfriars Road . And Avery , like an injured man who would not look at his own wound , slept within the walls of his little office , so that they became the boundary of his life . Once he sent Carol out to buy Anthony a present . She came back with a toy milk lorry with plastic bottles . You could lift the caps off and fill the bottles with water . They tried it out one evening , then sent it round to Battersea in the Humber . When all was ready , Haldane and Avery traveled to Oxfordfirst class on a Ministry Warrant . At dinner on the train they had a table to themselves . Haldane ordered half a bottle of wine and drank it while he completed the Times crossword . They sat in silence , Haldane occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haldane 's tie ; before he had time to think , he said , " Good Lord , I never knew you were a cricketer . " " Did you expect me to tell you ? " Haldane snapped . " I could hardly wear it in the Office . " " I 'm sorry . " Haldane looked at him closely . " You should n't apologize so much , " he observed . " You both do it . " He helped himself to some coffee and ordered a brandy . Waiters noticed Haldane . " Both ? " " You and Leiser . He does it by implication . " " It 's going to be different with Leiser , is n't it ? " Avery said quickly . " Leiser 's a professional . " 163THE LOOKING GLASS WAR " Leiser is not one of us . Never make that mistake . We touched him long ago , that 's all . " " What 's he like ? What sort of man is he ? " " He 's an agent . He 's a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his crossword . " He must be loyal , " Avery said . " Why else would he ac-cept ? " " You heard what the Director said : the two vows . The first is often quite frivolously taken . " " And the second ? " " Ah , that is different . We shall be there to help him take it . " But why did he accept the first time ? " " I mistrust reasons . I mistrust words like loyalty . And above all , " Ilaldane declared , " I mistrust motive . We 're runningan agent ; the arithmetic is over . You read German , did n't you ? In the beginning was the deed . " Shortly before they arrived , Avery ventured one more question . " Why was that passport out of date ? " Haldane had a way of inclining his head when addressed . " The Foreign Office used to allocate a series of passport numbers to the Department for operational purposes . The arrangement ran from year to year . Six months ago the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Circus . It seems Leclerc had been making insufficient claims on the facility and Control cut him out of the market . Taylor 's passport was one of the old series . They revoked the whole lot three days before he left . There was no time to do anything about it . It might never have been noticed . The Circus has been very devious . " A pause . " Indeed , I find it hard to understand what Control is up to . " They took a taxi to North Oxford and got out at the cor-164ner of their road . As they walked along the pavement Avery looked at the houses in the half-darkness , glimpsed grayhairedfigures moving across the lighted windows , velvetcoveredchairs trimmed with lace , Chinese screens , music stands and a bridge-four sitting like bewitched courtiers in a castle . It was a world he had known about once ; for a time he had almost fancied he was part of it ; but that was long ago . They spent the evening preparing the house . Haldane said Leiser should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the rooms on the street side . He had sent some academic books in advance , a typewriterand some imposing files . These he unpacked and arrangedon the dining room table for the benefit of the landlord'shousekeeper who would come each day . " We shall call this room the study , " he said . In the drawing room he installeda tape recorder . He had some tapes which he locked in a cupboard , meticulouslyadding the key to his key ring . Other luggage was still waiting in the hall : a projector , Air Force issue ; a screen ; and a suitcase of green canvas securely fastened , witl : leather corners . The house was spacious and well kept ; the furniture wal of mahogany , with brass inlay . The walls were filled witl ' pictures of some unknown family : sketches in sepia , minia ? tures , photographs faded with age . There was a bowl of potpourrion the sideboard and a palm cross pinned to the mir ? ror ; chandeliers hung from the ceiling , clumsy , but inoffensive ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smal cupid , very ugly , its face turned to the dark . The whole house gently asserted an air of old age ; it had a quality , lik ( incense , of courteous but inconsolable sadness . By midnight they had finished unpacking . They sat dowi 165THE LOOKING GLASS WAR Leiser 's Runin the drawing room . The marble fireplace was supported by blackamoors of ebony ; the light of the gas fire played over the gilded rose-chains which linked their thick ankles . The fireplace came from an age , it might have been the seventeenthcentury , it might have been the nineteenth , when blackamoors had briefly replaced Borzois as the decorative beasts of society ; they were quite naked , as a dog might be , and chained with goldcli roses . Avery gave himself a whisky , then went to bed , leaving I laldane sunk in his own thoughts . His room was large and dark . Above the bed hung a light shade of blue china ; there were embroidered covers on the bedside tables and a small enameled notice saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window hung a picture of a child saying its prayers while his sister ate breakfast in bed . He lay awake , wondering about Leiser ; it was like waiting for a girl . From across the passage he could hear Haldane'ssolitary cough , on and on . It had not ended when he fell asleep . Leclerc thought Smiley 's club a very strange place ; not at all the kind of thing he had expected . Two half-basement rooms and a dozen people dining at separate tables before a large fire . Some of then- were vaguely familiar . He suspected they were connected with the Circus . " This is rather a good spot . How do you join ? " " Oh , you do n't , " said Smiley apologetically , then blushed and continued , " I mean they do n't have new members . Just one generation . .. several went in the war , you know , some have died or gone abroad . What was it you had in mind , I wonder ? " " You were good enough to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes of course . How did that go , by the way ? I never heard . " 166 " It was just a training run . There was no film in the end . " " I 'm sorry . " Smiley spoke hastily , covering up , as if someonewere dead and he had not known . " We did n't really expect there would be . It was just a precaution . How much did Avery tell you , I wonder ? We 're training up one or two of the old hands . . . and some of the new boys too . It 's something to do , " Leclerc explained , " during the slack season . . . . Christmas , you know . People on leave . " " I know . " Leclerc noticed that the claret was very good . He wished he had joined a smaller club ; his own had gone off terribly . They had such difficulty with staff . " You have probably heard , " Leclerc added , officially as it were , " that Control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , yes , of course . " " My Minister was the moving spirit . He likes the idea of a pool of trained agents . When the plan was first mooted I went and spoke to Control myself . Later , Control called on me . You knew that , perhaps ? " " Yes . Control wondered ... " " He has been most helpful . Do n't think I am unappreciative . It has been agree  --  think I should give you the background , your own office will confirm i  --  hat if the training is to be effective , we must create as nearly as possible an operational atmosphere . What we used to call battle conditions . " An indulgent smile . " We 've chosen an area in westernGermany . It 's bleak and unfamiliar ground , ideal for frontier crossing exercises and that kind of thing . We can ask for the Army 's cooperation if we need it . " " Yes indeed . What a good idea . " " For elementary reasons of security , we all accept that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be briefed in the aspects of this exercisein which you are good enough to help . " " Control told me , " said Smiley . " He wants to do whatever he can . He did n't know you touched this kind of thing anymore . He was pleased . " " Good , " Leclerc said shortly . He moved his elbows forward a little across the polished table . " I thought I might pick your brains . . . quite informally . Rather as you peoplefrom time to time have made use of Adrian Haldane . " " Of course . " " The first thing is false documents . I looked up our old forgers in the index . I see I Iyde and Fellowby went over to the Circus some years ago . " " Yes . It was the change in emphasis . " " I 've written down a personal description of a man in our employment ; he is supposedly resident at Magdeburg for the purposes of the scheme . One of the men under training . Do you think they could prepare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thing ? Whatever is necessary . " The man would have to sign them , " Smiley said . " We would then stamp on top of his signature . We 'd need photographs , too . He 'd e 'd have to be briefed on how the documents worked ; perhaps Ilyde could do that on the spot with your agent ? " A slight hesitation . " No doubt . I have selected a cover name . It closely approximates his own ; we find that a useful technique . " " I might just make the point , " Smiley said , with a rather comic frown , " since this is such an elaborate exercise , that forged papers are of very limited value . I mean , one telephone call to the Magdeburg Town Administration and the best forgery in the world is blown sky high ... " 168 " I think we know about that . We want to teach them cover , submit them to interrogation . . . you know the kind of thing . " Smiley sipped his claret . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so easy to get hypnotized by technique . I did n't mean to imply . . . How is Haldane , by the way ? He read Greats , you know . We were up together . " " Adrian is well . " " I liked your Avery , " Smiley said politely . His heavy small face contracted in pain . " Do you realize , " he asked impressively , " they still do n't include the Baroque period in the German syllabus ? They call it a special subject . " " Then there is the question of clandestine wireless . We have n't used that kind of thing much since the war . I understandit has all become a great deal more sophisticated . High-speed transmission and so on . We want to keep up with the times . " " Yes . Yes , I believe the message is taped on a miniature recorder and sent over the air in a matter of seconds . " He sighed . " But no one really tells us much . The technical peoplehold their cards very close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which our people could profitably be trained . . . in a month , say ? " " And use under operational conditions ? " Smiley asked in astonishment . " Straightaway , after a month 's training ? " " Some are technically minded , you understand . People with wireless experience . " Smiley was watching Leclerc incredulously . " Forgive me . Would he , would they , " he inquired , " have other things to learn in that month as well ? " " For some it 's more a refresher course . " " Ah . " " What do you mean ? " 169THE LOOKING GLASS WAR " Nothing , nothing , " Smiley said vaguely and added , " I do n't think our technical people would be very keen to part with this kind of equipment unless ... " " Unless it were their own training operation ? " " Yes . " Smiley blushed . " Yes , that 's what I mean . They 're very particular , you know ; jealous . " Leclerc lapsed into silence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polished surface of the table . Suddenly he smiled and said , as if lw had shaken off depression , " Oh well . We shall just have to use a conventional set . Have directionfindingmnethods also improved since the war ? Interception , location of au illegal transmitter ? " " Oh yes . Yes , indeed. , . " We would hive to incorporate that . how long can a man remain on the air before they spot him ? " " Two or three minutes , perhaps . It depends . Often it 's a matter of luck how soon they hear him . They can only pin him clown while he 's transmitting . Much depends on the frequency . Or so they tell me. , , " In the war , " said I , eelerc reflectively , " we gave an agent several crystals . l aclh vibrated at a fixed frequency . Every so often he changed the crystal ; that was usually a safe enough method . We could *lo that again . " " Yes . Yes , I remember that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . possibly changing the coil . . . matching the aerial . " " Suppose a man is used to a conventional set ? You tell me the chances of interception are greater now than they were in the war ? You say allow two or three minutes ? " " Or less , " said Smiley , watching him . " It depends on a lot of things . . . luck , reception , amount of signal traffic , densityof population . . . . " 170Leiser 's Run " Supposing he changed his frequency after every two and a half minutes on the air . Surely that would meet the case ? " " It could be a slow business . " His sad , unhealthy face was wrinkled in concern . " You 're quite sure this is only training ? " " As far as I remember , " Leclerc persisted , courting his own idea , " these crystals are the size of a small matchbox . We could give them several . We 're only aiming at a few transmissions ; perhaps only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It 's hardly my province . " " What is the alternative ? I asked Control ; he said speak to you . He said you 'd help , find me the equipment . What else can I do ? Can I talk to your technical people ? " " I 'm sorry . Control rather agreed with the technical side , that we should give all the help we can , but not compromise new equipment . Risk compromising it , I mean . After all , it is only training . I think he felt that if you had n't full technical resources you should . . . " " Hand over the commitment ? " " No , no , " Smiley protested , but Leclerc interrupted him . " These people would eventually be used against military targets , " he said angrily . " Purely military . Control accepts that . " " Oh quite . " Smiley seemed to have given up . " And if you want a conventional set , no doubt we can dig one up . " The waiter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little into his glass , then slide the decanter carefully across the polished table . " It 's quite good , but I 'm afraid it 's nearly finished . When this is gone we shall have to break into the younger ones . 171THE LOOKING GLASS WARI 'm seeing Control first thing tomorrow . I 'm sure he 'll have no objection . About the documents , I mean . And crystals . We could advise you on frequencies , I 'm sure . Control made a point of that . " " Control 's been very good , " Leclerc confessed . He was slightly drunk . " It puzzles me sometimes . " Two days later , Leiser arrived at Oxford . They waited anxiously for him on the platform , Haldane peering among the hurrying faces in the crowd . It was Avery , curiously , who saw him first : a motionless figure in a camel 's hair coat at the window of an empty compartment . " Is that he ? " Avery asked . " He 's traveling first class . He must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were an affront . Leiser lowered the window and handed out two pigskin cases shaped for the trunk of a car , a little too orange for nature . They greeted one another briskly , shaking hands for everyone to see . Avery wanted to carry the luggage to the taxi , but Leiser preferred to take it himself , a piece in each hand , as if it were his duty . He walked a little away from them , shoulders back , staring at the people as they went by , startled by the crowd . His long hair bounced with each step . Avery , watching him , felt suddenly disturbed. 173THE LOOKING GLASS WARHe was a man ; not a shadow . A man with force to his body and purpose to his movement , but somehow theirs to direct . There seemed to be nowhere he would not walk . He was recruited ; and had assumed already the anxious , brisk manner of an enlisted man . Yet , Avery accepted , no single factor wholly accounted for Leiser 's recruitment . Avery was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the phenomenon of organic motivation ; with operations which lual no discernible genesis and no conclusion , which formed part of an unending pattern of activity until they ceased to have any further identity ; with that progress of fruitless courtships which , in the aggregate , passed for an active love life . But as he observed this man bobbing beside him , animate and quick , he recognized that hitherto they Iual courted ideas , incestuously among themselves ; now they had a human being upon their hands , and this was he . They climbed into the taxi , Leiser last because he insisted . It was midafternoon , a slate sky behind the plane trees . The smoke rose from the North Oxford chimneys in ponderous columns like proof of a virtuous sacrifice . The houses were of a modest stateliness ; romantic hulls redecked , each according to a different legend . Here the turrets of Avalon , there the carved trellis of a pagoda ; between them the monkey-puzzletrees , and the half-hidden washing like butterflies in the wrong season . The houses sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first lace and then brocade , petticoats and skirts . It was like a bad watercolor , the dark things drawn too heavy , the sky gray and soiled in the dusk , the paint too worked . They dismissed the taxi at the corner of the street . A smell of leaf-mold lingered in the air . If there were children they 174made no noise . The three men walked to the gate . Leiser , his eyes on the house , put down his suitcases . " Nice place , " he said with appreciation . He turned to Avery : " Who chose it ? " " I did . " " That 's nice . " He patted his shoulder . " You did a good job . " Avery , pleased , smiled and opened the gate ; again Leiser was determined that the others should pass through first . They took him upstairs and showed him his room . He still carried his own luggage . " I 'll unpack later , " he said . " I like to make a proper job of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical way , picking things up and looking at them ; he might have come to bid for the place . " It 's a nice spot , " he repeated finally ; " I like it . " " Good , " said Haldane , as if he did n't give a damn . Avery went with him to his room to see if he could help . " What 's your name ? " Leiser asked . He was more at easewith Avery ; more vulgar . " John . " They shook hands again . " Well , hello , John ; glad to meet you . How old are you ? " " Thirty-four , " he lied . A wink . " Christ , I wish I was thirty-four . Done this kind of thing before , have you ? " " I finished my own run last week . " " How did it go ? " " Fine . " " That 's the boy . Where 's your room ? " Avery showed him . " Tell me , what 's the setup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What do you mean ? " " Who 's in charge ? " " Captain Hawkins . " " Anyone else ? " " Not really . I shall be around . " " All the time ? " " Yes . " He began unpacking . Avery watched . He had brushes backed with leather , hair lotion , a whole range of little bottles of things for men , an electric shaver of the newest kind and ties , some in tartan , others in silk , to match his costly shirts . Avery went downstairs . IIaldane was waiting . He smiled as Avery came in . " Well ? " Avery shrugged , too big a gesture . He felt elated , ill at ease . " What do yon mike of him ? " he asked . " I hardly know him , " IIaldane said drily . He had a way of terminating conversations . " I want you to be always in his company . Walk with him , shoot with him , drink with him if you must . IIe 's not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between ? " " We 'll see about that . Meanwhile do as I say . You will find he enjoys your company . He 's a very lonely man . And remember , lie 's British : British to the core . One more thing ? this is most importan  --  o not let him think we have changed since the war . The Department has remained exactly as it was : that is an illusion you must foster even " ? he did not smile ? " even though you are too young to make the comparison . They began next morning . Breakfast over , they assembled in the drawing room and Haldane addressed them . The training would be divided into two periods of a fortnighteach , with a short rest in between . The first was to be a 176refresher course ; in the second , old skills , now revived , would be related to the task which lay ahead . Not until the second period would Leiser be told his operational name , his cover and the nature of his mission ; even then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which he was to be infiltrated . In communications as in all other aspects of his training he would graduate from the general to the particular . In the first period he would familiarize himself once more with the technique of ciphers , signal plans and schedules . In the secondhe would spend much time actually transmitting under semi-operational conditions . The instructor would arrive during that week . Haldane explained all this with a certain pedagogic acrimonywhile Leiser listened carefully , now and then briskly nodding his assent . Avery found it strange that Haldane took so little care to conceal his distaste . " In the first period we shall see what you remember . We shall give you a lot of running about , I 'm afraid . We want to get you fit . There 'll be small arms training , unarmed combat , mental exercises , tradecraft . We shall try to take you walkingin the afternoons . " " Who with ? Will John come ? " " Yes . John will take you . You should regard John . as your adviser on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discuss , any complaint or anxiety , I trust you will not hesitate to mention it to either one of us . " " All right . " " On the whole , I must ask you not to venture out alone . I should prefer John to accompany you if you wish to go to the cinema , do some shopping or whatever else the time allows . But I fear you may not have much chance of recre-ation. " 177THE LOOKING GLASS WAR " I do n't expect it , " Leiser said . " I do n't need it . " He seemed to mean he did n't want it . " The wireless instructor , when he comes , will not know your name . That is a customary precaution : please observe it . The daily woman believes we are participating in an academicconference . I can not imagine you will have occasion to talk to her , but if you do , remember that . If you wish to make inquiries about your business , kindly consult me first . You should not telephone without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographers , medical people , technicians . They are what we call ancillaries and are not in the picture . Most of their- believe you 're here as part of a wider training scheme . Please refine nler this . " " O.K. , " saki I , ciscr. 1 Ialdamie looked at his watch . " Our first appointment is at ten o'clock . A car will collect us from the corner of the road . The driver is not one of us : no conversation on the journey , please . Have you no other clothes ? " lie asked . " ' Those are scarcely suitable for the range . " I 've got a shorts coat and a pair of flannels . " " I could wish you less conspicuous . " As they went upstairs to change , Leiser smiled wryly at Avery . " IIe 's a real boy , is n't he ? The old school . " " But good , " Avery said . Leiser stopped . " Of course . Here , tell me something . Was this place always here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You 're not the first , " Avery said . " Look , I know you ca n't tell me much . Is the outfit still like it was . . . people everywhere . . . the same setup ? " " I do n't think you 'd find much difference . I suppose we 've expanded a bit . " " Are there many young ones like you ? " 17RLeiser 's Run " Sorry , Fred . " Leiser put his open hand on Avery 's back . He used his hands a lot . " You 're good , too , " he said . " Do n't bother about me . Not to worry , eh , John ? " They went to Abingdon : the Ministry had made arrangements with the parachute base . The instructor was expecting them . " Used to any particular gun , are you ? " " Browning three eight automatic , please , " Leiser said , like a child ordering groceries . " We call it the nine millimeter now . You 'll have had the Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back while Avery helped wind in the man-sized target to a distance of ten yards and pasted squares of gum-strip over the old holes . " You call me Staff , ' " the instructor said and turned to Avery . " Like to have a go as well , sir ? " Haldane put in quickly , " Yes , they are both shooting , please , Staff . " Leiser took first turn . Avery stood beside Haldane while Leiser , his long back toward them , waited in the empty range , facing the plywood figure of a German soldier . The target was black , framed against the crumbling whitewash of the walls ; over its belly and groin a heart had been crudely described in chalk , its interior extensively repaired with fragments of paper . As they watched , he began testing the weight of the gun , raising it quickly to the level of his eye , then lowering it slowly ; pushing home the empty magazine , taking it out and thrusting it in again . He glanced over his shoulder at Avery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WAR Leiser 's Runforehead a strand of brown hair which threatened to impede his view . Avery smiled encouragement , then said quickly to Haldane , talking business , " I still ca n't make him out . " " Why not ? He 's a perfectly ordinary Pole . " " Where does he come from ? What part of Poland ? " " You 've read the file . Danzig . " " Of course . " The instructor began . " We 'll just try it with the empty gun first , both eyes open , and look along the line of sight , feet nicely apart now thank you , that 's lovely . Relax now , be nice and comfy , it 's not a drill movement it 's a firing position , oh yes , we 've done this before ! Now traverse the gun , point it but never aim . Right ! " The instructor drew breath , opened a wooden box and took out four magazines . " One in the gun and one in the left hand , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched with fascination as Leiser deftly slipped a hill magazine into the butt of the automatic and advanced the safety catch with his thumb . " Now cock the gull , pointing it at the ground three yards ahead of you . Now take up a firing position , keeping the arm straight . Pointing the gun but not aiming it , fire off one magazine , two shots at a time , remembering that we do n't regard the automatic as a weapon of science but more in the order of a stopping weapon for close combat . Now slowly , very slowly . .. " Before he could finish , the range was vibrating with the sound of Leiser 's shootin  --  e shot fast , standing very stiff , his left hand holding the spare magazine precisely at his side like a grenade . He shot angrily , a mute man finding expression . Avery could feel with rising excitement the fury and purpose of his shooting ; now two shots , and another two , then three , then a long volley , while the haze gathered180around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the sweet smell of cordite . " Eleven out of thirteen on the target , " the instructor declared . " Very nice , very nice indeed . Next time , stick to two shots at a time please , and wait till I give the fire order . " To Avery , the subaltern , he said , " Care to have a go , sir ? " Leiser had walked up to the target and was lightly tracing the bullet holes with his slim hands . The silence was suddenlyoppressive . He seemed lost in meditation , feeling the plywood here and there , running a finger thoughtfully along the outline of the German helmet , until the instructor called , " Come on , we have n't got all day . " Avery stood on the gym mat , measuring the weight of the gun . With the instructor 's help he inserted one magazine , clutching the other nervously in his left hand . Haldane and Leiser looked on . Avery fired , the heavy gun thudding in his ears , and he felt his young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Good shot , John , good shot ! " " Very good , " said the instructor automatically . " A very good first effort , sir . " He turned to Leiser : " Do you mind not shouting like that ? " He knew a foreigner when he saw one . " How many ? " Avery asked eagerly , as he and the sergeant gathered round the target , touching the blackened perforationsscattered thinly over the chest and belly . " How many , Staff ? " " You 'd better come with me , John , " Leiser whispered , throwing his arm over Avery 's shoulder . " I could do with you over there . " For a moment Avery recoiled . Then , with a laugh , he put his own arm around Leiser , feeling the warm , crisp cloth of his sports jacket in the palm of his hand. 181THE LOOKING GLASS WAR Leiser 's RunThe instructor led them across the parade ground to a brick barrack like a theatre with no windows , tall at one end . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public lavatory . " Moving targets , " Haldane said . " And shooting in the dark . " At lunch they played the tapes . The tapes were to run like a theme through the first two weeks of his training . They were made from old phonographrecords ; there was a crack in one which recurred like a metronome . Together , they comprised a massive parlor game in which things to he remembered were not listed but mentioned , casually , obliquely , often against a distracting background of other noises , now contradicted in conversation , now corrected or contested . There were three principal voices , one female and two male . Others would interfere . It was the woman who got on their nerves . She had that antiseptic voice which air hostesses seem to acquire . In the first tape she read from lists , quickly . First it was a shopping list , two pounds of this , one kilo of that ; without warning she was talking about colored skittle  --  o many green , so many ochre ; then it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that caliber ; then a factory with capacity , waste and production figures , annual targets and monthly achievements . In the second tape she had not abandoned these topics , but strange voices distracted her and led the dialogue into unexpected paths . While shopping she entered into an argument with the grocer 's wife about certain merchandise which did not meet with her approval ; eggs that were not sound , the outrageous cost of butter . When the grocer himself attempted to mediate he was accused of favoritism ; there was talk of points and ration cards , the extra allowance of sugar for182jam-making ; a hint of undisclosed treasures under the counter . The grocer 's voice was raised in anger but he stopped when the child intervened , talking about skittles . " Mummy , Mummy , I 've knocked over the three green ones , but when I tried to put them up , seven black ones fell down ; Mummy , why are there only eight black ones left ? " The scene shifted to a public house . It was the woman again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . Figures were disputed , new targets stated , old ones recalled ; the performance of a weapo  --  weapon unnamed , undescribe  --  as cynically questioned and heatedly defended . Every few minutes a voice shouted " Break ! " ? it might have been a refere  --  nd Haldane stopped the tape and made Leiser talk about football or the weather , or read aloud from a newspaper for five minutes by his watch ( the clock on the mantelpiece was broken ) . The tape recorder was switched on again , and they heard a voice , vaguely familiar , trailing a little like a parson 's ; a young voice , deprecating and unsure , like Avery 's : " Now here are the four questions . Discounting those eggs which were not sound , how many has she bought in the last three weeks ? How many skittles are there altogether ? What was the annual overall output of proved and calibrated gun barrels for the years 1937 and 1938 ? Finally , put in telegraph form any information from which the length of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stud  --  e seemed to know the gam  --  o write down his answers . As soon as he had left the room Avery said accusingly , " That was you . That was your voice speaking at the end . " " Was it ? " Haldane replied . He might not have known . There were other tapes too , and they had the smell of death ; the running of feet on a wooden staircase , the slam-183THE LOOKING GLASS WAR ming of a door , a click , and a girl 's voice askin  --  he might have been offering lemon or cream ? " Catch of a door ? Cocking of a gun ? " Leiser hesitated . " A door , " he said . " It was just the door . " " It was a gun , " Haldane retorted . " A Browning nine milli- meter automatic . The magazine was being slid into the butt . " In the afternoon they went for their first walk , the two of them , Leiser and Avery , through Port Meadow and into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They walked fast , striding over the whip grass , the wind catching at Leiser 's hair and throwing it wildly about his head . It was cold but there was no rain ; a clear , sunless day when the sky above the flat fields was darker than the earth . " You know your way around here , do n't you ? " Leiser asked . " Were you at school here ? " " I was an undergraduate here , yes . " " What did you study ? " " I read languages . ( : erman principally . " They climbed a stile and emerged in a narrow lane . " You married ? " he asked . " Yes . " " Kids ? " " One . " " Tell me something , John . When the Captain turned up my card . . . what happened ? " " What do you mean ? " " What does it look like , an index for so many ? It must be a big thing in an outfit like ours . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just cards . Why ? " " He said they remembered me : the old hands . I was the best , he said . Well , who remembered ? " 184 " They all did . There 's a special index for the best people . Practically everyone in the Department knows Fred Leiser . Even the new ones . You ca n't have a record like yours and get forgotten , you know . " He smiled . " You 're part of the furniture , Fred . " " Tell me something else , John . I do n't want to rock the boat , see , but tell me this . . . Would I be any good on the inside ? " " The inside ? " " In the Office , with you people . I suppose you 've got to be born to it really , like the Captain . " " I 'm afraid so , Fred . " " What cars do you use up there , John ? " " Humbers . " " Hawk or Snipe ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better job , you know . " " I 'm talking about nonoperational transport , " Avery said . " We 've a whole range of stuff for the special work . " " Like the van ? " " That 's it . " " How long before . . . how long does it take to train you ? You , for instance ; you just did a run . How long before they let you go ? " " Sorry , Fred . I 'm not allowed . . . not even you . " " Not to worry . " They passed a church set back on a rise above the road , skirted a plowed field and returned , tired and radiant , to the cheerful embrace of the Mayfly house and the gas fire playingon the golden roses . In the evening , they had the projector for visual memory : they would be in a car , passing a marshaling yard ; or in a train beside an airfield ; they would be taken on a walk185THE LOOKING GLASS WAR Leiser 's Runthrough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vehicle or a face had reappeared , and they had not remembered its features . Sometimes a series of disconnected objects were flashed in rapid succession on the screen , and there would be voices in the background , like the voices on the tape , but the conversation was not related to the film , so that the student must consult both his senses and retain what was valuable from each . Thus the first day ended , setting the pattern for those that followed : carefree , exciting days for them both , days of honestlabor and cautious but deepening attachment as the skills of boyhood became once more the weapons of war . For the unarmed combat they had rented a small gymnasiumnear I cadington which they had used in the war . An instructor had come by train . They called him Sergeant . " Will he be carrying a knife at all ? Not wanting to be curious , " lie asked respect hilly . IIe had a Welsh accent . Haldane slirliggccl . " It depends what he likes . We do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot to be said for a knife , sir . " Leiser was still in the changing room . " If he knows how to use it . And the Jerries do n't like them , not one bit . " He had brought some knives in a handcase , and he unpacked them in a private way , like a salesnian unpacking his samples . " They never could take cold steel , " he explained . " Nothing too long , that 's the trick of it , sir . Something flat with the two cutting edges . " He selected one and held it up . " You ca n't do much better than this as a matter of fact . " It was wide and flat like a laurel leaf , the blade unpolished , the handle waisted like an hourglass , crosshatched to prevent slip . Leiser was walkingtoward them , smoothing a comb through his hair . " Used one of these , have you ? " 186Leiser examined the knife and nodded . The sergeant looked at him carefully . " I know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm a bloody Welshman . " " You taught me in the war . " " Christ , " said Lowe softly , " so I did . You have n't changed much , have you ? " They grinned shyly at one another , not knowing whether to shake hands . " Come on then , sec what you remember . " They walked to the coconut matting in the center of the floor . Lowe threw the knife at Leiser 's feet and he snatched it up , grunting as he bent . Lowe wore a jacket of torn tweed , very old . He stepped quickly back , took it ' off and with a single movement wrapped it around his left forearm , like a man preparing to fight a dog . Drawing his own knife he moved slowly around Leiser , keeping his weight steady but riding a little from one foot to the other . He was stooping , his bound arm held loosely in front of his stomach , fingers outstretched , palm facing the ground . He had gathered his body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of it while Leiser kept steady , his eyes fixed upon the sergeant . For a time they feinted back and forth ; once Leiser lunged and Lowe sprang back , allowing the knife to cut the cloth of the jacket on his arm . Once Lowe dropped to his knees , as if to drive the knife upward beneath Leiser 's guard , and it was Leiser 's turn to spring back , but too slowly it seemed , for Lowe shook his head , shouted " Halt ! " and stood upright . " Remember that ? " He indicated his own belly and groin , pressing his arms and elbows in as if to reduce the width of his body . " Keep the target small . " He made Leiser put his knife away and showed him holds , crooking his left arm around Leiser 's neck and pretending to stab him in the kidneysor the stomach . Then he asked Avery to stand as a dummy , and the two of them moved around him with187THE LOOKING GLASS WAR detachment , Lowe indicating the places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particular trick came back to him . " You did n't weave with the blade enough . Remember , thumb on top , blade parallel to the ground , forearm stiff , wrist loose . Do n't let his eye settle on it , not for a moment . And left hand in over your own target , whether you 've got the knife or not . Never be generous about offering the body , that 's what I say to my daughter . " They laughed dutifully , all but Haldane . After that , Avery had a turn . Leiser seemed to want it . Removing his glasses , he held the knife as Lowe showed him , hesitant , alert , while Leiser trod crabwise , feinted and darted lightly back , the sweat running off his face , his small eyes alight with concentration . All the time Avery was con- scions of the sharp grooves of the haft against the flesh of his palm , the aching in his calves and buttocks as he kept his weight forward on his toes , and Leiser 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riser 's foot had hooked around his ankle ; as he lost balance he felt the knife being wrenched from his hand ; he fell back , Leiser 's full weight upon him , Leiser 's hand clawing at the collar of his shirt . They helped him up , all laughing , while Leiser brushed the dust from Avery 's clothes . The knives were put away while they did physical training ; Avery took part . When it was over , Lowe said , " We 'll just have a spot of unarmed combat and that will do nicely . " Haldane glanced at Leiser . " Have you had enough ? " " I 'm all right . " Lowe took Avery by an arm and stood him in the center of the gym mat . " You sit on the . bench , " he called to Leiser , " while I show you a couple of things . " He put a hand on Avery 's shoulder . " We 're only con- 188 Leiser 's Runcerned with five marks , whether we got a knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kidneys , belly , heart and throat , " Leiser replied wearily . " How do you break a man 's neck ? " " You do n't . You smash his windpipe at the front . " " What about a blow on the back of the neck ? " " Not with the bare hand . Not without a weapon . " He had put his face in his hands . " Correct . " Lowe moved his open palm in slow motion towardAvery 's throat . " Hand open , fingers straight , right ? " " Right , " Leiser said . " What else do you remember ? " A pause . " Tiger 's Claw . An attack on the eyes . " " Never use it , " the sergeant replied shortly . " Not as an attacking blow . You leave yourself wide open . Now for the strangleholds . All from behind , remember ? Bend the head back , so , hand on the throat , so , and squeeze . " Lowe looked over his shoulder : " Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my own benefit . . . . Come on , then , if you know it all , show us some throws ! " Leiser stood up , locking arms with Lowe , and for a while they struggled back and forth , each waiting for the other to offer an opening . Then Lowe gave way , Leiser toppled and Lowe 's hand slapped the back of his head , thrusting it down so that Leiser fell face forward heavily on to the mat . " You fall a treat , " said Lowe with a grin , and then Leiser was upon him , twisting Lowe 's arm savagely back and throwing him very hard so that his little body hit the carpets like a bird hitting the windshield of a car . " You play fair ! " Leiser demanded , " or I 'll damn well hurt you . " " Never lean on your opponent , " Lowe said shortly . " And 189THE LOOKING GLASS WAR Leiser 's Rundo n't lose your temper in the gym . " He called across to Avery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him some exercise . " Avery stood up , took off his jacket and waited for Leiser to approach him . He felt the strong grasp upon his arms and was suddenly conscious of the frailty of his body when matched against this adult force . He tried to seize the forearmsof the older man , but his hands could not encompass them ; he tried to break free , but Leiser held him ; Leiser 's head was against his own , filling his nostrils with the smell of hair oil . Ile felt the damp stubble of his cheek and the close , rank heat of his thin , straining body . Putting his hands on Leiser 's chest he forced himself back , throwing all his energy into one frantic effort to escape the suffocating constriction of the man 's embrace . As he drew away they caught sight of one another , it might have been for the first time , across the heaving cradle of their entangled arms ; Leiser 's face , contortedwith exertion , softened into a smile ; the grip relaxed .

Shall we settle up ? " 190Lowe stood lightly to attention while Haldane prepared to pay him : traveling money , salary , and thirty-seven and six for the knife , plus twenty-two shillings for the sheath , a flat metal one with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receipt , signing it S.L. for reasons of security . " I got the knife at cost , " he explained . " It 's a fiddle we work through the Sports Club . " He seemed proud of that . Haldane gave Leiser a trench coat and Wellingtons and Avery took him for a walk . They went by bus as far as Headington , sitting on the top deck . " What happened this morning ? " Avery asked . " I thought we were fooling about , that 's all . Then he threw me . " " He remembered you , did n't he ? " " Of course he did : then why did he hurt me ? " " He did n't mean to . " " Look , it 's all right , see . " He was.still upset . They got out at the end of the line and began trudging through the rain . Avery said , " It 's because he was n't one of us ; that 's why you did n't like him . " Leiser laughed , slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in slow waves across the empty street , ran down their faces and trickled into . the collars of their mackintoshes . Avery pressed his arm to his side , holding Leiser 's hand captive , and they continued their walk in shared contentment , forgetting the rain , or playing with it , treading in the deepest parts and not caring about their clothes . " Is the Captain pleased , John ? " " Very . He says it 's going fine . We begin the wireless soon , just the elementary stuff . Jack Johnson 's expected tomorrow . " " It 's coming back to me , John , the shooting and that . I had n't forgotten . " He smiled . " The old three eight . " 191THE LOOKING GLASS WAR " Nine millimeter . You 're doing fine , Fred . Just fine . The Captain said so . " " Is that what he said , John , the Captain ? " " Of course . And he 's told London . London 's pleased too . We 're onlyafraid you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wel  --  oo English . " Leiser laughed . " Not to worry , John . " The inside of Avery 's arm , where he held Leiser 's hand , felt dry and warm . They spent a morning on ciphers . Haldane acted as in- structor . IIe had Iwo ' gilt pieces of silk cloth imprinted with a cipher of the type Leiser would use , and a chart backed with cardboard for converting letters into numerals . He put the chart on the mntelpiece , wedging it behind the marble clock , and lectured then ' rather as Leclerc would have done , but without affectation . Avery and Leiser sat at the table , pencil in hand , and under Haldane 's tuition converted one passage after another into numbers according to the chart , deducted the result from figures on the silk cloth , finally re- translating into letters . It was a process which demanded application rather than concentration , and perhaps because Leiser was trying too hard he became bothered and erratic . " We 'll have a timed run over twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet of paper in his hand a mes- sage of eleven words with the signature Mayfly . " From next week you will have to manage without the chart . I shall put it in your room and you must commit it to memory . Go ! " He pressed the stopwatch and walked to the window while the two men worked feverishly at the table , muttering almost in unison while they jotted elementary calculations on the scrap paper in front of them . Avery could detect the 192 increasing flurry of Leiser 's movements , the suppressed sighs and imprecations , the angry erasures ; deliberately slowing down , he glanced over the other 's arm to ascertain his progressand noticed that the stub of pencil buried in his little hand was smeared with sweat . Without a word , he silently changed his paper for Leiser 's . Haldane , turning around , might not have seen . Even in these first few days , it had become apparent that Leiser looked to Haldane as an ailing man looks to his doctor ; a sinner to his priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his strength from such a sickly body . Haldane affected to ignore him . He adhered stubbornly to the habits of his private life . He never failed to complete his crossword . A case of Burgundy was delivered from the town , half bottles , and he drank one alone at each meal while they listened to the tapes . So complete , indeed , was his withdrawalthat one might have thought him revolted by the man 's proximity . Yet the more elusive , the more aloof Haldane became , the more surely he drew Leiser after him . Leiser , by some obscure standards of his own , had cast him as the English gentleman , and whatever Haldane did or said only served , in the eyes of the other , to fortify him in the part . Haldane grew in stature . In London he was a slow-walkingman ; he picked his way pedantically along the corridors as if he were looking for footholds ; clerks and secretaries would hover impatiently behind him , lacking the courage to pass . In Oxford he betrayed an agility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame had revived , he held himself erect . Even his hostility acquired193THE LOOKING GLASS WARthe mark of command . Only the cough remained , that racked , abandoned sob too heavy for such a narrow chest , bringing dabs of red to his thin cheeks and causing Leiser the mute concern of a pupil for his admired master . " Is the Captain sick ? " he once asked Avery , picking up an old copy of Haldane 's Times . " He never speaks of it . " " I suppose that would be bad form . " His attention was suddenly arrested by the newspaper . It was unopened . Only the crossword had been done , the margins around it sparsely annotated with permutations of a nine-letter anagram . He showed it to Avery in bewilderment . " Ile does n't read it , " he said . " Iie 's only done the competi-tion . " That night , when they went to bed , Leiser took it with him , furtively as if it contained some secret which study could reveal . So far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress . In the great variety of activities to which Leiser was now subjected , they had been able to observe him more closely ; with the corrosive perception of the weak they discovered his failing and tested his power . He acquired , as they gained his trust , a disarming frankness ; he loved to confide . Ile was their creature ; he gave them everything , and they stored it away as the poor do . They saw that the Department had provided direction for his energy : like a man of uncommon sexual appetite , Leiser had found in his new employment a love which he could illustrate with his gifts . They saw that he took pleasure in their command , giving in return his strength as homage for fulfillment . They even knew perhaps that between them they constituted for Leiser the poles of absolute authority : the one by his bitter adherence to standards which Leiser could never achieve ; 194Leiser 's Runthe other by his youthful accessibility , the apparent sweetnessand dependence of his nature . He liked to talk to Avery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume  --  t was irritating for Avery , but nothingmor  --  hat a man in his middle thirties , whether married or not , led an intense and varied love life . Later in the eveningwhen the two of them had put on their coats and hurried to the pub at the end of the road , he would lean his elbows on the small table , thrust his bright face forward and relate the smallest detail of his exploits , his hand beside his chin , his slim fingertips rapidly parting and closing in unconsciousimitation of his mouth . It was not vanity which made him thus , but friendship . These betrayals and confessions , whether truth or fantasy , were the simple coinage of their intimacy . He never mentioned Betty . Avery came to know Leiser 's face with an accuracy no longer related to memory . He noticed how its features seemed structurally to alter shape according to his mood , how when he was tired or depressed at the end of a long day the skin on his cheekbones was drawn upward rather than down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that his expression was at once more Slav and less familiar . He had acquired from his neighborhood or his clients certainturns of phrase which , though wholly without meaning , impressed his foreign ear . He would speak , for instance , of some measure of satisfaction , " using an impersonal constructionfor the sake of dignity . He had assimilated also a variety of cliches . Expressions like " not to worry , " " do n't rock the boat , " " let the dog see the rabbit , " came to him continually , as if he were aspiring after a way of life which he only imperfectly understood , and these were the offerings that would buy him in . Some expressions , Avery remarked , were out of date. 195THE LOOKING GLASS WAROnce or twice Avery suspected that Haldane resented his intimacy with Leiser . At other times it seemed that Haldane was deploying emotions in Avery over which he himself no longer disposed . One evening at the beginning of the second week , while Leiser was engaged in that lengthy toilet which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not wish to go out himself . " What do you expect me to do ? Make a pilgrimage to the shrine of my youth ? " " I thought you night have friends there ; people you still know . " " If I do , it would be insecure to visit them . I am here under another name . " " I 'm sorry . Of course . " " Besides " ? a dour smile ? " we are not all so prolific in our friendships . " " You told me to stay with him ! " Avery said hotly . " Precisely ; and you have . It would be churlish of me to complain . You do it admirably . " " Do what ? " " Obey instructions . " At that moment the doorbell rang and Avery went downstairs to answer it . By the light of the streetlight he could see the familiar shape of a Department van parked in the road . A small , homely figure stood on the doorstep . He was wearing a brown suit and overcoat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brown shoes . He might have come to read the meter . " Jack Johnson 's my name , " he said uncertainly . " Johnson 's Fair Deal , that 's me . " " Come in , " Avery said . " This is the right place , is n't it ? Captain Hawkins . and all that ? " 196Leiser 's RunHe carried a soft leather bag which he laid carefully on the floor as if it contained all he possessed . Half closing his umbrella he shook it expertly to rid it of the rain , then placed it on the stand beneath his overcoat . " I 'm John . " Johnson took his hand and squeezed it warmly . " Very pleased to meet you . The boss has talked a lot about you . You 're quite the blue-eyed boy , I hear . " They laughed . He took Avery by the arm in a quick confiding gesture . " Using you own name , are you ? " " Yes . Christian name . " " And the Captain ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayfly ? How 's he bearing up ? " " Fine . Just fine . " " I hear he 's quite a one for the girls . " While Johnson and Haldane talked in the drawing room , Avery slipped upstairs to Leiser . " It 's no go , Fred . Jack 's come . " " Who 's Jack ? " " Jack Johnson , the wireless chap . " " I thought we did n't start that till next week . " " Just the elementary this week , to get your hand in . Come down and say hello . " He was wearing a dark suit and held a nail file in one hand . " What about going out , then ? " " I told you ; we ca n't tonight , Fred ; Jack 's here . " Leiser went downstairs and shook Johnson briefly by the hand , without formality , as if he did not care for latecomers . They talked awkwardly for a quarter of an hour until Leiser , protesting tiredness , went sullenly to bed. 197THE LOOKING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's slow , " he said .

But he is slow , sir , very . " He had an attentive , nursery-rhyme way of talking as if he spent much time in the company of children . " The Boss says I 'm to play him all the tim  --  hen he starts the job , too . I understand we 're all going over to Germany , sir . " " Yes . " " Then we shall have to get to know each other , " he insisted , " Mayfly and inc . We ought to be together a lot , sir , the moment I begin working him on the set .

That 's a lot to learn iii a fortnight . " " Safety devices ? " Avery asked . " Deliberate mistakes , sir ; like a misspelling in a particular group , an E for an A or something of that kind . If he wants to tell us he 's been caught and is transmitting under control , he 'll miss the safety device . " He turned to Haldane . " You know the kind of thing , Captain . " " There was talk in London of teaching him high-speed transmission on tape . Do you know what became of that idea ? " " The Boss did mention it to me , sir . I understand the equipment was n't available . I ca n't say I know much about it , really ; since my time , the transistorized stuff .

" " About fifty pounds , sir , in all . The ordinary suitcase set . It 's the waterproofing that adds the weight , but he 's got to have it if he 's going over rough country .

" Schmelzer is good boy , " he said . " Takes guts to deal with KKK . If they think for a minute they can take Schmelzer and his men , they do it . " " Are n't you afraid they 'll use those automatic weapons against you some day ? " I asked . Kornie shrugged . " Most of those KKK and their weapons will never get back from this mission . " He looked at his watch . It was 4:00 A.M. Kornie smiled at me and patted my shoulder . " Now is the time to start out for Chau Lu . We will drive the VC straight into the KKK at 0545 , and Bergholtz and the Cambodes will cut both the KKK and VC to pieces and be out of there by 0600 hours . " His laugh resounded in the radio shack . " Give me just a few more days and a regiment could n't overrunPhan Chau . " There was a snapping of static and then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is Handy . Come in , Grant . " Kornie picked up the mike . " This is Grant . Go ahead , Handy . " " Last of bandits across . We are ready to carry out phase two . Is 0545 hours still correct ? " " Affirmative , Handy . But wait for us to start our little party off . " " Roger , Grant . We will be in position . When you open up we 'll let go too . Leaving now . Handy out . " " Grant out , " Kornie said into the mike and put it down . He walked out of the radio room , and on the parade ground we could sense more than see the company of Vietnamese strikers . Two Vietnamese Special Forces officers , the camp commander , Captain Lan , and his executive officer were standing in front of the company of civilian irregulars waiting for Kornie . They saluted him as he stood in the light flooding from the door of the radio room . Kornie saluted back . " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men are ready , " the Vietnamese commander said . " LieutenantCau and Sergeant Tuyet will lead them . I must stay in camp . Maybe B team need talk to me . " " Very good thinking , Captain , " Kornie complimented his counterpart . " Yes , since I go out , very good you guard camp . " Pleased , Captain Lan turned his men over to Kornie and departed . " Lieutenant Cau , let 's get these men on the move , " Kornie urged . " You know the objective . " 41 " Yes , sir . Chau Lu . " In the dim light from the radio shack Kornie and I could just make out the broad grin on Cau 's face . " We will clobber them , sir , " he said , proud of his English slang . Kornie nodded happily . " Right . We massacre them . " To me he said , " Cau here is one of the tigers . If they had a few hundred more like him we could go home . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think . " For the second time that night we started north toward Chau Lu . Kornie seemed to be an inexhaustible tower of energy . Walking at the head of the column he kept up a brisk pace , but we had to stop frequently to let the shortlegged Vietnamese catch up . It took exactly the estimated hour and a half to cover the almost five miles to the positions we took up south and east of the VC village . At 5:45 A.M. two companies of strikers were in place ready to attack Chau Lu . Schmelzer 's men were ready to hit from the north . Lieutenant Cau glanced from his wrist watch to the walls of the village one hundred yards away . He raised his carbine , looked at Kornie who nodded vigorously , and blasted away on full automatic . Instantly from all around the village the strike force began firing . Lieutenant Cau shrilled his whistle and his men moved forward . Fire spurted back at us from the village , incoming rounds whining . Instinctively I wanted to throw myself down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire from the village shouting and shooting . From the north Schmelzer 's company charged in on the village also . Within moments the volume of return fire from the VC village faded to nothing . " They 're on their way now , escaping to their privileged sanctuary , " Kornie yelled . " Cease fire , Lieutenant Cau . " After repeated blasts on the whistle the company gradually , reluctantly , stopped shooting . Schmelzer 's people had also stopped and there was a startling silence . The two companies entered the village and routed the civilians out of the protective shelters dug in the dirt floors of their houses . Kornie looked at Lieutenant Cau in the pale light of dawn . Disappointmentwas clearly written on his face as his men herded civilians into the center of town . Cau had not been told about the rest of this operation . After a few minutes of preliminary questioningCau came to Kornie. 42 " The people say no men in this village . All drafted into the Army . Just old men , women , and children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infectious grin puzzled the Vietnamese officer . " Lieutenant Cau , you tell the people that in just a few minutes they 'll know exactly where their men are . " Cau looked at Kornie , still puzzled . " They run across into Cambodia . " He pointed across the town toward the border . " I would like to take my men after them . " He smiled sadly . " But I think maybe I do my country more good if I am not in jail . " " You 're so right , Cau . Now search the town . See if you can find any hidden arms . " " We are searching sir , but why would the VC hide guns here when just two hundred meters away they can keep them in completesafety . " Before Kornie could answer , a sudden , steadily increasing cracklingof gunfire resounded through the crisp air of dawn . Kornie cocked an ear happily . The noise became louder and more scattered . Automatic weapons , the bang of grenades , sharp rifle reports and then the whooshing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rounds echoed up and down the border . " Bergholtz is giving them hell , " Kornie shouted gleefully , thumpingme on the back . I tried to get out from under his powerful arms . " My God ! I wish I was with Bergholtz and the Cambodes . " A sharp burping of rounds which suddenly terminated with the explosion of a grenade caused Kornie to yell at Schmelzer , who was approachingus . " Hey , Schmelzer . That was one of those Chinese machine guns we gave the KKK . Did you hear it jam ? " " I heard a grenade get it , " Schmelzer answered . The faces of the old men , women , and children were masks of sudden fear , confusion , and panic . They stole looks at we three Americans and a slow comprehension began to show in their eyes . Then their features twisted into sheer hatred . The fire-fight raged for fifteen minutes as the sun was rising . To the south a steady series of flares spurted from the top of the hill , marking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Vietnam . Kornie took a last look around the village . " OK , Schmelzer , let's43go pay off the KKK . Give the ones that come back a nice bonus . If they complain about being attacked by their good friends the VC , tell them "  --  Kornie grinned  --  " we 're sorry about that . " He gave his executive officer a hearty slap on the back that would have sent a smaller man tumbling . " Be sure that your whole company has weapons at the ready , " Kornie cautioned . " They might think we slipped it to them on purpose and do something naughty . " Kornie was thoughtful for a moment . " Maybe I take a platoon of Lieutenant Cau 's men and go with you . If we meet no trouble I 'll go on south , find Bergholtz , and see how he did . " Leaving Lieutenant Cau the dreary task of searching the village and questioning the inhabitants , we started south . It was only a mile walk to the needle of rock , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well covered by a platoon of his best riflemen , approached the KKK leader who was dressed in khaki pants and a black pajama shirt  --  two bandoleers of ammunition crossing his shoulders . An interpreter walked beside Schmelzer , and Kornie and I edged forward , being careful not to get between our riflemen and the KKK . Both Schmelzer and Kornie gave the thoroughly mean- and suspicious-looking bandit leader friendly smiles . Schmelzerreached inside his coat and produced a thick wallet . The sight of the money seemed to have a slightly calming effect on the KKK chief . " When all your men are back I give you the other 25,000 piastres , " Schmelzer said , counting the money . The translator came back with the chief 's retort . " Maybe my men do not all come back . Who they fight over there ? " " The VC of course , " Schmelzer answered innocently . " Your men are friends of the Americans and Vietnamese are n't they ? " The KKK chief scowled , but he did not take his eyes off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an uncomfortably long wait in a highly hostile atmosphere until the rest of the KKK started to arrive at needle rock from across the border . Kornie and Schmelzer impassively watched the wounded , bloody men straggling in . Those who could n't walk were helped by others . One or two carried shattered bodies . " Remember how those monks looked with their heads under the arms ? " Kornie asked Schmelzer , who nodded grimly. 44Of the 50 KKK who had gone out , 30 were alive , only 10 unwounded . They brought back only six bodies . The KKK chief , regarding his broken force , turned toward Kornie , his hand twitching at the trigger guard of the Chinese submachinegun Schmelzer had given him . There was no doubt that the KKK knew they had been tricked by the Americans . Still , Kornie and Schmelzer played the game , expressingcondolences at the number of KKK killed and wounded . " Tell the chief , " Schmelzer said , " we will pay a bounty of 500 piastres for each VC killed . " The chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The interpreter listened , turning his head sidewise to the KKK leader . " He says , " came the translation , " that his men were attacked from two directions at once . He says that first the shooting came from insideCambodia and then from the VC running from the attack we made on Chau Lu . His men fired in both directions but killed mostly the men running from Chau Lu because they were easier to see . He says he wants to be paid for killing 100 VC . His men had no time to take ears or hands for proof . He says we tricked him , we did not tell him about Chau Lu . " " Tell him it was a very unfortunate misinterpretation of orders , " Kornie said . " We 'll pay him 500 piastres each for 25 VC dead , and we 'll give him a 1,000 piastres for each of the men he lost KIA . " Schmelzer 's company of Vietnamese irregulars sensed the hatred of the KKK for us and shifted their weapons uneasily ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes glowed malevolentlyas he estimated our strength and then accepted the deal . " Why do you pay him anything ? " I asked . " He 's going to try and get you anyway first chance that comes along . " Kornie grinned . " If a battle across the border is reported I think Saigon would accept the proposition that I paid a bunch of Cainbodianbandits to break up the VC in Cambodia long enough to make my camp secure . " To Schmelzer he said , " Get receipts from the leader for the money and get photographs of him accepting it . " The interpreter called to Kornie as he and I were about to leave with a security platoon . " Sir , KKK chief say he lose three automatic weapons and two rifles . He want them replaced . " " You tell him I 'm sorry about that . We gave him the guns . If he45ca n't hold on to them , that 's his fault . " Kornie waited until his words had been translated . He stood facing the chief , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The KKK chief realized he had been accorded all the concessions he could expect and avoided Kornie 's steady gaze . Schmelzer and his sergeant continued countingout the money for the Cambodian bandits . The groans of the wounded men attracted Kornie 's attention . He walked over to where they were sitting or lying in the dirt . After examiningsome of the more seriously wounded he straightened up . " Schmelzer , before you go , ask the Vietnamese medics to help these men . They may be bandits fighting us tomorrow , looting merchantsand monks the next day , but they do us a big service today  --  even though they do not mean to . " And when you finish here go directly back to Phan Chau . And keep an alert rear guard all the time . " Kornie grinned good-naturedlyat the scowling group around the KKK leader . " Those boys have big case of the ass with us . " Kornie and I and his platoon left the needle-rock rendezvous and walked south for two miles to our Cambodians ' rally point , coveringthe distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security squad were just welcoming the returning Cambodians as we arrived . Sergeant Ebberson , the medic , had the tools of his trade spread out and ready . Stretchers and bearers were waiting . Bergholtz , grinning from ear to ear , was waiting for us . " How goes , Bergholtz ? " Kornie called , striding toward his big sergeant . " We greased the shit out of them , sir , " Bergholtz cried joyfully . " These Cambodes never had so much fun in their lives . " The little dark men in tiger-striped suits bounced around happily , chattering to each other and displaying bloody ears , proof of the operation 's success . " How many VC KIA 's ? " " Things were pretty confused , sir . From Chau Lu the VC walked right into us and the KKK . There was a lot of shooting going on in front of us . I think they killed as many of each other as we did in . Then the KKK and the VC both concentrated on us and our Cambodesflat-ass massacred everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't 60 dead VC lying out there I 'll extend another six46months . We lost a few dead and maybe 8 or 10 wounded but we did n't leave a body behind , sir . " Kornie 's eyes glistened with pride . " By God damn , Bergholtz . We got the best camp in Vietnam . I volunteer us all to stay another six months . What you say ? " " Well , sir , we still have one more month of this tour to burn the asses off the VC . This trip we made it just in time . When we pulled out the VC were barreling down the road from the big camp , shootinglike mad . " Kornie watched as two Cambodians deposited the gore-smeared body of a comrade on the ground beside two other bodies . Sergeant Ebberson was working on the wounded as they were dragged and assisted in . Even the wounded were in good spirits . They had won a victory and the fact that it had been won by going illegally across the border only made the triumph more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another around Bergholtz , and started us in the direction of Phan Chau . " Let 's go back , men . Maybe the VC call Phnom Penh and the Cambodian government will be screaming border violation . We must get immediatereport to Colonel Train . " We walked at the head of the security platoon for a few minutes and then Kornie said to me , " You are friend of Colonel Train . How much of what happened today can I tell him ? If the VC attackus tonight we might not be able to hold . But they wo n't hit us now . " " I guess he 'd understand that , Steve . Would n't look good for him to lose a camp . But he 's still not really an unconventional warfare man . " Kornie nodded in dour agreement . " Too bad he could n't spend a week with you , " I went on . " That would make a Sneaky Pete out of him if anything ever could . " " He would court-martial me out of the Army after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tended to agree. 472 . It startled me to look at my watch as we marched into Phan Chau and see it was not quite 9:00 A.M. With all the action I thought it must be later . Kornie went into the operations room in the longhouseto prepare an after-action report . About noon , Falk completed his assessment of the interrogations at Chau Lu and the account Bergholtz had given him . Kornie called a meeting to which he invited me . It was the considered opinion of the Americans that there was little danger of the VC attacking Phan Chau for a few days at least . Kornie called for Sergeant Rodriguez . I was surprised to see the olive-complected Rodriguez in this camp of Viking types . Kornie 's booming laugh when I stared at the Latin showed he had read my mind . " Let me tell you , there is nothing more important than a good demolitions man in the kind of work we do . It takes a special devious mind to be a great demo man in the guerrilla game . " Kornie gave Rodriguez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin demon in the spirit for explosives and detonating systems that makes Rodriguez the best demo man I know in ten years at this business . " Without further explanation Kornie led the short , slight and swarthy sergeant , almost invisible in his commander 's bear hug , toward a corner machine-gun bunker . I considered taking a nap , but if Kornie , five years older than I , could look fresh and combat-ready , then I resolved not to sleep either . Instead I walked into the combined chow and recreation room , pulled up a chair and started making notes on what I 'd seen that day . About 3:30 there was a great commotion on the parade ground . I ran out at once . Lieutenant Cau , his pistol in the back of the neck of a striker , was herding a Vietnamese irregular toward the cage . This is a wire-mesh structure for punishment confinement common to all camps I had visited . It was impossible either to sit down or stand up in it , and during the day the sun broiled the occupant. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cage . A Vietnamese Special Forces sergeant opened the cage and the striker was crammed inside , the wire-mesh door locked behind him . Kornie and Rodriguez , who had been somewhere deep inside one of the fortress-camp 's bunkers , crossed the parade ground and arrived at the cage as Lieutenant Cau finished a savage dressing-down of the prisoner . " What 's the flap , Cau ? " Kornie asked . " We discover this man cutting some barbed wire his work detail placing along west wall . " Kornie 's face became grave . He turned to Rodriguez . " Finish that job even if you have to work all night . " " Yes , sir . " Rodriguez left on the double . Kornie stared thoughtfully at the prisoner . " Have you questioned him yet ? " " No , sir , " Lieutenant Cau answered . " But I have put my best men along the walls and given orders that nobody leave Phan Chau . No man from here give VC any new information . " " Very good , Cau . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I expect it . I advise you and the camp commander to start ; ' interrogating this one now . " " Sir , Captain Lan took a convoy into town this afternoon . " The lieutenant winked openly . " He may not be back until late tonight . " " That makes you acting camp commander , Cau . What are you going to do ? " Instantly Cau barked orders and two Vietnamese sergeants dragged the squirming striker out of the cage . " You should take this in , " Kornie suggested to me , as the prisoner was hustled off . " Sergeant Ngoc , our Vietnamese Special Forces intelligence sergeantis an expert interrogator . He learned the trade with the Viet Minh before deciding he was not a Communist . I will introduce you to him , then I go back to work . I am worrying how much time we really did buy with our little operation this morning . " Kornie led me to the Vietnamese headquarters building . Newlyconstructed out of concrete with a wood roof , it already had the unkemptlook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me along the dank corridor to a square cement roomat the rear of the building . Slits at the top of the walls served as windows . A naked , glowing bulb hanging from the ceiling supplementedthe light that seeped through the slits . A sallow-complexioned , almost cross-eyed Vietnamese NCO stood behind a crude wooden table surveying the trembling striker who had been brought in . I was introduced to Sergeant Ngoc and after he had milked my hand I rubbed it hard on my fatigue pants . I stood in a far corner of the room and watched the proceedings . Ngoc ambled around the table toward the prisoner , seemingly payinghim no attention- . Suddenly Ngoc 's right hand , palm cupped , swung out and with a hollow pop walloped the right ear of the captive , whose face contorted as he let out a whining yelp . Almost instantly Ngoc repeated the blow with his left hand to the left ear . The VC suspect desperately massaged under his ears and behind his jaw line . Ngoc asked him a question , but the answer did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the striker sagging to his knees . Ngoc gestured toward the table and two Vietnamese Special Forces enlisted men , acting as guards , dumped their charge into the chair . Ngoc snatched at his victim 's left hand and drew it toward him , turning it fingers up , forcing the wrist down on a leather strap nailed to the table . One of the guards fastened the strap tightly around the prisoner 's wrist . Ngoc drew a bayonet from his belt and stabbed it into the table beside him . The prisoner flinched . From under the lapel of his camouflage uniform Ngoc pulled a long heavy pin with a purple globe for a head . In one swift movement he grabbed the striker 's thumb with his left hand and with his right forced the pin under the thumbnail deep into the quick . The suspect screamed . Ngoc pushed his face across the table and asked a question . The answer was unsatisfactory . Slowly , staringimpassively at his victim , Ngoc worked the bayonet out of the table . Conversationally , he asked the prisoner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He waited . No answer . With the flat of the bayonet blade he tapped the head of the pin . The VC suspect let out another scream . Perspiration flowed from his face . One of the guards held the prisoner 's right arm in a painful hammerlock . Calmly , Ngoc replaced the bayonet on the table , reached into an inner pocket , and pulled out a notebook and ball-point pen . He50laid them near at hand . Then he took up the ball-point pen in his right hand and poised it above the notebook while he quietly asked questions . The suspect blurted out words . Ngoc shook his head chidingly and carefully placed the pen back on the table . He picked up the bayonet and with a click tapped the needle almost to the depth of the quick . A tortured shriek was torn from the prisoner and tears rolled from his eyes . Patiently , Ngoc exchanged the bayonet for the pen and waited expectantly . The prisoner was shaking and mumbling , but still he refused to divulge the information Ngoc was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sighed , put down the pen and picked up the bayonet again . The prisoner 's eyes followed each move Ngoc made . Ngoc held the flat of the blade above the purple pinhead , looked questioningly at the prisoner , and with slow , measured taps drove the needle down into the thumb-joint itself . The screeches extracted with each tap seemed to come not from consciousvocal mechanisms but from the suspect 's inner being . Ngoc dropped his pose of patience and cried out savagely . The prisoner was obviously weakening , his brown face now red and sweat-soaked , his wet eyes glittering hysterically as he watched the flat of the bayonet hover above the head of the pin and then descend with a sharp clack which drove the needle all the way through the bent thumb-joint . Lungs busily sucking in the dank air feeding the suspect 's nerveshatteringscreams , his whole body twitched and shuddered . It seemed that Ngoc had succeeded in breaking his man . When the echoes subsided , Ngoc began asking questions again . Perhaps the suspect regained control again or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At any rate , a moment 's relapse into apparentdefiance angered Ngoc , who grabbed the head of the imbeddedpin and shook it . It took all the strength of the two guards to hold the screeching , thrashing body . Finally the prisoner slumped in exhaustion , gasping " Nuc , " the Vietnamese word for water . Ngoc took up his pen again as the prisoner tried to talk , but the words whistled dryly from his throat . At a wave of Ngoc 's hand a guard picked up a bucket of water and dashed it into the suspect 's openmouthed face . The water revived him sufficiently to talk . At once Ngoc began51making notes . Whenever the prisoner seemed on the verge of cutting off the flow of information , Ngoc needed only to move a thumb and forefinger toward the head of the pin protruding from under the victim 's thumbnail and his speech picked up speed . After ten minutes of questioning Ngoc was satisfied . He said a few , almost gentle words to the prisoner  --  and then , a fast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was in his fingers . The VC , for such he had finally admitted to being , moaned and slumped semi-conscious onto the table . Ngoc wiped the needle off in his victim 's hair and thrust it back into the underside of his lapel . He turned to me with a satisfied look . Picking up his notebook and pen he motioned me to follow him . Moments later we were out in the bright sunlight . I stood a momentbreathing deeply but Ngoc hurried to Kornie 's operations room . An interpreter translated as Ngoc , consulting his notebook , delivered to Kornie , Bergholtz , Schmelzer , Falk and Lieutenant Cau the information he had extorted from the VC who had infiltrated the ranks of the Phan Chau strike force . Ngoc now had the names of five other VC in the camp . It was possible there were more , but the five on Ngoc 's list were the only ones the captured VC knew for sure . Furthermore , Ngoc reported , the attack had indeed been planned for tonight . The prisoner of course had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . He had n't been among the strikers that raided Chau Lu . Lieutenant Cau left to arrest the five men . Kornie looked at his wrist watch . " Too late now for the B-team intelligence boys with a polygraph crew to get here and question them . " He shrugged . " Ngoc 's methods work on some of these people , but I do not like torture . We do not even know if the five men our VC infiltrator named are really Communists . With Ngoc I find his victims say anything they think he wants to hear . The lie detector is the best . " Kornie turned to Bergholtz . " Tell Borst to radio a report of this to the B team and ask for the polygraph crew tomorrow . " " Right , sir . " Kornie looked at me . " What do you think of our interrogation procedure ? " 52 " It 's always grim , " I answered . " But I 've been around some damned crude sessions . Ngoc is more refined than most . " Kornie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . What say a little schnapps before supper . Hey ? Schmelzer ? Falk ? " Kornie yelled down to the kitchen for ice , went to a cabinet , and took out a bottle of vodka . " Not like the schnapps we drink at my house in Fayetteville , eh ? " " That old aqua vitae was it , Steve . " " Yeah . It is too bad . The PX in Saigon do n't carry schnapps . " The ice arrived and Kornie poured us all a slug of vodka on the rocks . He held his glass up . " Well , even if we only buy another twenty-four hours , the operation was a success . " Kornie downed the rest of his drink . " Schmelzer , we keep 50 per cent alert tonight . Now I am going out to the corner bunkers . " Before he could leave , Bergholtz returned . " Borst got through to the B detachment , " the team sergeant reported . " Captain Farnham and Sergeant Stitch will be out with the polygraph tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " 3 . The following morning there was feverish activity in camp . The concertina , barbed wire so named because it was put out in big cylindrical rolls shaped like an extended squeezebox , had been anchoredto metal pickets around the entire outer perimeter of the camp . Beyond the concertina , tanglefoot barbed wire had been stretched out in the high grass . The inner perimeter was lined with sandbagged heavy log walls , with more barbed wire at their base and sharp bamboo pungi stakes pointing outwards . There was a third innermost defense position , the heavily sandbagged commandbunker which could withstand even direct hits by mortar shells . On top of it was a protected observation post . The camp was pockmarked with round , sandbagged mortar emplacements . Phan Chau seemed all but impregnable to me , but Kornie , an experienced man at both assault and defense , was obviously concerned . At noon I saw him inspecting the inner defenses and the bunkers53for the fourth time that morning . I walked over to him . " Looks like it would take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kornie shook his head . " We do n't even put out mines and booby traps yet . If they throw two battalions at us they might overrun the camp . It depends on how good the strike force fights . By God damn those politicians in Saigon should not have taken away my Hoa Hao troops . " He studied the outer defense perimeter , a worried look on his ordinarily jovial face . " My Cambodes will stand up good . But when the attack comes the VC ultimately get through the outer barbed wire and we must fight them hand to hand between the pe-rimeters . " " You 're pretty sure it will come ? " " They got to attack . The VC been telling the people in all the hamlets around here they will take Phan Chau and then destroy every hamlet loyal to Saigon . They lose face they do n't hit us . The VC know we get stronger every day . " Kornie strode toward the teamhouse . " I am going to tell Colonel Train the whole story , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for three years , maybe even six if he extends . He needs bad the education you do n't get at the School . He may relieve me from command but before he goes from Vietnam he will know I am right " Right on schedule at 1:30 P.M. the Huey landed outside camp . Kornie , Schmelzer , Captain Lan who had returned from town , and Lieutenant Cau were out to meet Lieutenant Colonel Train and his men from the B team . The colonel alighted from the helicopter and shook hands all around . He asked me if I was finding things interestingenough . Following the colonel out of the chopper came Captain Farnham , the intelligence officer , and his sergeant carrying a large black case . We walked through the two gates into camp and Kornie asked if anyone wanted a cold drink . Train shook his head . " Let 's get on with the job . " " Right , " agreed Kornie . " Sergeant Ngoc and Sergeant Falk are the intelligence NCO 's here . They 'll show Captain Farnham to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from there . " Train nodded . " Now , Kornie , you and I have to talk someplace54secure . High command and the embassy have been asking some very strange questions about your operations out here . " " We can go to the operations room , sir . " Train took the cigar out of his mouth and gave me an apologetic smile . " You 'll have to excuse us for an hour . Take a look at the polygraph in operation . " Sergeant Stitch had set up his machine on the table . With its dials , electrodes , and batteries it was a formidable-looking instrument . The interpreter , Ngoc , and Lieutenant Cau stared at the lie detector with great interest . " OK , " Captain Farnham said , " bring in the prisoners one by one . " He asked Falk what he wanted to get out of them . " Sir , we want to know if they are VC infiltrators . If they are we want to know the names of other VC sympathizers in the camp . We 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We think it was planned for last night . Fortunately , we headed it off tempo-rarily . " Farnham gave the intelligence sergeant a sharp look . " That 's what Colonel Train wants to find out about . What the hell did you do ? Go right into Cambodia after them ? " " Sir , I guess Captain Kornie will be discussing that with the colonel . " " Good enough . " Farnham turned to his sergeant . " Stitch here is an expert with the polygraph . If anybody can find the answers for you he 's the man . " Lieutenant Cau opened the door and three guards shoved a tigersuitedstriker into the room . He looked around fearfully and then saw the ominous-looking equipment on the table and recoiled . He was shoved roughly into the chair . Stitch walked over to the frightened striker and said a few words in Vietnamese . The prisoner looked up , swallowed , and nodded . Farnham leaned toward me . " The only Vietnamese Stitch knows is how to say , We want to ask you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be hurt . " The intelligence officer chuckled . " But the Vietnamese think he understands every word they say even though he uses an inter-preter . " The reassuring words did little to erase the fear written on the55suspect 's face , and when Stitch started attaching the electrodes to the striker 's wrists and then wrapped the blood-pressure tubes around his biceps and started to inflate them , terror shone from his eyes . Stitch flicked a switch and made some adjustments on the machine . A needle began to oscillate . Then , through the interpreter , Stitch began to ask questions . Ngoc was fascinated with the machineand stared at the needle . It quivered as the interrogation proceeded , and then even before the translator put the question into Vietnamese it vibrated noticeably . Stitch had said " VC . " The prisoner denied he was a VC . The needle jumped . Ngoc grasped the significance of the box at once and in an instantwas on the prisoner , cuffing him sharply on the ears . The prisoner let out a startled yelp and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he wo n't get hurt if he tells the truth , " Stitch said . " Tell him every time he lies this box tells me . " Stitch went back to casual questions , forming a pattern of needle oscillation when the striker told the truth . Ngoc watched the needle intently . " Do you know of any other VC who have infiltrated the strike force ? " Stitch asked . The question was translated . The striker shook his head and said no . The needle jumped and once again Ngoc was upon the prisoner , backhanding him across the temples . Stitch waved Ngoc away . He turned dials and a humming noise came from the box . He pumped more air into the rubber tubes around the prisoner 's biceps . " Now , " Stitch said to the interpreter , " you tell this man that if he lies to me again this machine will blow his arm off . " From the look of terror on the striker 's face there was no doubt he believed the infernal machine was quite capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiendishness . Stitch had the names of the other four strikers implicated by the VC Ngoc had questioned the day before . The translator asked by individual name if the other prisoners were VC infiltrators . The suspect , staring aghast at the machine , answered yes four times . The polygraph indicated he was telling the truth . Ngoc was delighted . Through the interpreter he said , " This is56truly a fine machine . Now we do n't waste time . We know exactly who to torture . " Stitch shook his head . " When you learn to use this machine you do n't need to use torture . I can find out whatever you want to know through the polygraph . " Ngoc listened to the translation and asked , " What if they refuse to say a word ? " " They 're probably hard-core VC , " Stitch replied . " Chances are you wo n't even torture the truth out of them . " " If they are truly the enemy they should be tortured anyway , " Ngoc retorted . " Now we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearily to the Americans in the room . " If we stay here for twenty years we wo n't change them , and God save us from getting like them . " To the translator , Stitch said , " Put this Communist in a solitary cell and let me work on another one . " While Sergeant Stitch demonstrated the effectiveness of the polygraph , Lieutenant Colonel Train and Captain Kornie were in heated discussion . Much later , Kornie gave me a detailed description of the interview . " Look , Kornie , " Train began , the moment he and Kornie had seated themselves in the operations room , facing the large map of the local terrain . " I know your record . You 're a hell of a fighter . But whatever you did yesterday morning has got the ambassador and our generals in a serious flap . The Cambodian government complainedthat American-led Vietnamese troops violated the border and killed or wounded 25 Cambodian civilians . They named Phan Chau as the originating point of this aggression . " Kornie did not reply immediately to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unorthodox warfare . Train puffed on his cigar and Kornie tapped a cigarette out of his pack , lit it , and sat back waiting . " I do n't really believe you 'd violate the border without telling us , Kornie , " Train primed . " Apparently the Cambodian complaint was informal . They did n't make it public nor are they going to SEATO or the United Nations . But they said that if the United States and Vietnam do not remove the irresponsible officers who have no regardfor the sovereignty of Cambodia , then Cambodia will ask for57help from wherever they can get it to protect their citizens from American-inspired marauders . " Train looked at Kornie sharply . " That means inviting in North Vietnam and Red China . Now what did happen ? " Kornie stood up and walked to the map . " In the first place , sir , if my camp had been attacked last night on schedule we would have been overrun . When we let the Vietnamese corps commander take away my 250 Hoa Hao strikers , they took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be certain were not infiltrated by Viet Cong sympathizers . " " Kornie , " Train began , " you know what General Co said . " Kornie nodded . " He was afraid that Hoa Hao colonel might unite his men in a power play . So he broke up all Hoa Hao units . But out here , with a damned VC regiment sitting safely across the border building up to hit me , I could count on the Hoa Hao to fight the Communists and be loyal to me . " Train growled something inaudible and studied the burning end of his cigar . " Sir , " Kornie continued , " when I lose the Hoa Hao I got only a company of Cambodes besides the Vietnamese strikers . I got a camp to defend that is half finished . We are vulnerable . We do n't get the concertina until the day before yesterday . Even now we got no mines , no booby traps outside our wire . Phan Chau is supposedto be the most important border surveillance camp in this sector . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mekong Delta through these hills . " Kornie rapped the map with a big fist . " The Viet Cong want us out of here , sir . If we finish the camp 's defenses they can not take Phan Chau . But if they hit us now , when we are weak , while they got infiltrators in our strike force , they stand a damned good chance of overrunning us and destroying Phan Chau . " Kornie stopped talking for a moment , then continued . " Between the Hoa Haos and the Cambodes , even with the defenses not done , we could fight off two , maybe three battalions of VC . But because of Vietnamese politics I lose my real fighting force . Phan Chau is going to be attacked , sir , " Kornie said forcefully . " Every day agent reports say we are in for it . Yesterday we catch a striker cutting barbed wire . He tells us the attack was planned for last night . And58only Christ , maybe in this case Buddha , knows how many strikers in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if the words were making an impression . Train puffed his cigar . " Do you agree , sir , " Kornie continued , " that I had to do something to head off this attack ? " Train took the cigar out of his mouth . " Perhaps , Kornie . But did you have to violate the border and cause an incident ? " " Sir , I did what I had to do to save my camp ! " " All right , Kornie , " Train said . " Tell me everything . Do n't leave out a single detail . " " Right , sir . " Kornie sat down again and for twenty minutes explained the operation . Train sucked hard on his cigar as he concentrated on Kornie 's story . When it was over the colonel leaned back , an expression somewhere between pain and disbelief on his face . He ground out his cigar viciously . " Captain , that is the most audacious , unorthodox , and irresponsibleoperation that any man in any command of mine has ever pulled . My God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But sir , it worked , " Kornie argued . " Not only we hurt the VC and the KKK bandits , we stall off the attack . Even we get hit tonight , in the last twenty-four hours we doubled our defensive capabilities . We got claymore mines out at least , and one or two other little tricks for the Communists when they come . My men , the demo sergeantmost of all , been working without sleep twenty-four hours . " " Kornie , you know you ca n't go off attacking across borders , hiringbandits , acting like "  --  he sputtered  --  " like the CIA . We 're part of the United States Army . " He picked up the green beret on the table beside him . " Do you think this hat gives you some kind of special license to go off on your own , conduct operations that may endangerthe peace of the world ? " " Sir , I 've been in Special Forces almost ten years . All that time we were trained to get special jobs done any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agency for a year . I know what I can and what I cannotdo to get the job done . " Then , after a short pause : " It takes times to be a Special Forces officer . You will see , sir . " Nonplussed , Train pulled another cigar out of the pocket of his59jungle fatigues , bit the end off , and lit up . Slowly he exhaled a puff of smoke , trying to decide just what to do about this difficult subordinate . " Kornie , " he said finally , " I have to go to Saigon tomorrow and I 'd like you to come with me . " " But , sir , we expect attack any day or night . I must be here , at least until the attack is over . " He thought a minute . " We are both in trouble if I am away from my post when it is overrun . " Train considered the situation . Before he could answer there was a knock at the door . " See who it is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schmelzer , followed by Lieutenant Cau . " Excuse me , sir , " Schmelzer said to Train , " but this may be important . " " Go ahead , Lieutenant . " " Right , sir . We were interrogating the prisoners when a Vietnamesesergeant came in saying that two strikers on barbed-wire detail deserted . He had their names and Sergeant Stitch asked the man he was interrogating with the polygraph if they were VC sympathizers . The answer was yes . " Kornie turned to Train . " You understand what this maybe is , sir ? If the deserters tell the VC we are grabbing infiltrators , they might attack tonight while they still got people on the inside . " " Sir ! " Schmelzer interjected . " One of the strikers we questioned said he thought the attack would come tonight . They all said it was planned for last night . " Kornie shot a look at Train and then ordered Schmelzer to forget the interrogation . " Get as many more claymore mines out as you can . Tell Rodriguez all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 per cent alert until midnight , full alert for the rest of the night . Let the men who have the least sleep go to bed after supper . " Schmelzer and Cau left the operations room . " Colonel , " Kornie said , " let me stay here until the attack comes or we get our defenses so good the VC do n't try to take the camp . We are in trouble now . " " Why did you let yourself get into this bind , Kornie ? " The captain struggled to keep his patience . " Sir , my Hoa Haos were taken away on a day 's notice . If you check my requests you see that for last two days I am begging for two companies of Vietnamese60Marines , Rangers , or paratroopers to help us hold until the camp is completed . " " All right , Kornie , you stay until the camp is secure . But make sure the job takes no more than a week . You and I have a date in Saigon . " " Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intelligence section on the chopper and get them back to the B detachment . " " And you , sir ? " " I 'll stay overnight . " " Sir , " Kornie protested , " even after what we did yesterday , we expect an attack tonight . " " Yes , Captain . I suspect the VC have all the reinforcements they need right in Cambodia . " And with finality he said , " I will be here if they do hit Phan Chau tonight . " 4 . Lieutenant Colonel Train and I had a few brief words at 5:00 P.M. The Huey was waiting to take off with the intelligence section and the VC infiltrators , who were tied with wire and lying face down on the floor of the helicopter . Lieutenant Colonel Train wanted me deported from the potentialbattle scene , and I had to remind him we had put in three months together at Fort Bragg and that he knew I was trained for this sort of thing . " Also , " I said as a clincher , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I get myself zapped that 's tough , but it 's my job to chance itTrain , Kornie , and I saw the chopper off , then returned to the camp . At the outer perimeter of the concertina Kornie supervised the closing of the barbed-wire barricade as we went through . He repeated the process again at the inner gate . There was a faint coolness between Train and Kornie at supper , but the B-team CO was every inch the commander who loved and admired his troops and was happiest when in the field . He could be personal with them without encouraging undue familiarity . After supper the weapons sergeant brought Train a pistol belt61and harness hung solidly with ammunition pouched . " There 's four hundred rounds of AR-15 ammo on the belt , sir , and more in the mortar bunkers . " Kornie , the inexhaustible Viking , finally admitted that he had n't slept in almost two days and asked Train 's permission to be excused until midnight . So Train and I accompanied Lieutenant Schmelzer on his round of inspections along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Train asked the lieutenant . " Yes , sir . ' Fifty-eight . " " I thought I saw it on your record . I was class of forty-eight . Had three years enlisted service during the war . " Train smiled at the young lieutenant . " You 're about ready to make captain . I suppose you 'll be going to a more conventional Infantry unit when you finish the Special Forces assignment ? " " I would n't go in any straight-leg outfit if I could help it , sir . I 'm going to try and keep extending in Special Forces . " Train shook his head . " You 're young , Schmelzer . You have the makings of a fine career . But none of us can afford to do more than two tours at most in Special Forces . After six years your thinking gets unorthodox . After nine years you 're typed . You 'll be lucky to retire a bird colonel . " " I know staying in Special Forces has slowed up a lot of careers , but I believe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . She 's with me all the way , " Schmelzer added proudly . " My father was Regular Army and he feels the same way you do , but wars are changing . We 'll either be fighting against guerrillas like we are here , or we 'll be guerrillas  --  maybe in Cuba or Eastern Europe , probably pretty soon now in North Vietnam . " Schmelzer excused himself and mounted the key northwest bunker . " Fine young officer , " Train observed . " He 'll work out well after his Special Forces service is behind him . " We waited for him to come down . " How is it , Lieutenant ? " " They 're up there , sir , wide awake on that machine gun . I just hope they 're ours . " " Why would n't they be ? " Train asked sharply . " Major Tri  --  my counterpart at the B team  --  has full confidence in his men here and the strike-force personnel under them . " 62 " Yes , sir , " Schmelzer replied dutifully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt tired . " If you fellows will excuse me , I think I 'll grab a few hours sleep . I 'll be ready at midnight , Lieutenant . You can put me anywhere you need an extra gun . " " We 'll wake you up , " Schmelzer promised . " Full alert for all Americans after midnight . Captain Lan wo n't agree to more than 50 per cent alert for the Vietnamese . I guess he 's afraid he 'll have to stay up all night too . " " Schmelzer , you should be more careful how you talk about your Vietnamese counterparts , " Train said . " Major Tri tells me his officersare very sensitive about being depreciated by us . " " Yes , sir , " I heard Schmelzer say as they walked off . " But you do have to watch them , sir . " Sergeant Bergholtz shook me awake after midnight and told me that the captain wanted me in the operations room . There I found Kornie , a tired but resolute Lieutenant Colonel Train , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just risen from a full night 's sleep . " Looks like we maybe get hit , " Kornie was saying when I came in . " There are lights we never seen all around us  --  fires , flashlights , signal flares . If they attack we radio the B team for Air Force flare ships to light up the area . " " Any place you want me ? " I asked . " You go with Bergholtz and Falk . They take over a 60-mm. mortar position and tell you what to do . " " Right . " " Ready to go , sir ? " Bergholtz asked me . " Any time . " They led me out of the operations room across the parade ground to a round sandbagged bunker between the American and Vietnameseheadquarters . The mortar bunker was near the west wall  --  the wall facing the border from which the attack was expected . It had the least amount of open terrain , about three hundred yards from the outer defense perimeter to the scrub-brush and rocky base of the hills . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sure . Just tell me what charge you want . " " We 'll probably be dropping them pretty close . Charge two . Your63other job is to make damned sure none of our own strikers get near us if there 's an attack . They might be VC and toss a grenade in with us . " " I 'll keep my eyes open . " " Right . And if you hear anything heavy fall in here , " Bergholtz said as we climbed over the sandbags , " yell grenade and we 'll bail the hell out . " " Do we have any Vietnamese in this crew ? " " Yeah , they 're still resting . But if the fireworks start they 'll be in here . We 'll identify them . " Falk indicated the wooden crates of mortar shells and we pulled two of them out of the depths of the heavily sandbagged ammunitionsection of the bunker and began opening cardboard tubes . On each shell we pulled the increments  --  little pouches of powder  --  from the tail fins , leaving just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The other box was left with its rounds on full charge for longer-range shelling . Captain Kornie , closely attended by Lieutenant Colonel Train , stopped by the bunker on one of his constant inspection rounds . When he left , Bergholtz and Falk discussed in low tones the possibilities of an attack that night . Falk , as intelligence sergeant , said all evidence pointed to the VC hitting . Bergholtz countered that the VC simulate preparations to hit camps all over Vietnam just to keep the Americans shaken up . " I 'll bet you 1,000 piastres to 500 we do n't get hit tonight , " Bergholtz said . Falk looked up from a mortar round with interest . He was about to answer when an angry rattle shook the air overhead . Before Falk could answer Bergholtz cried , " You took too long , Babe . Bet 's off . " The yell of " mortars " passed across the bunkers . I threw myself down next to the bunker wall . There was a violent explosion just behind us , followed by several more as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WP ! " Falk cried . The flames from the white phosphorus rounds started setting fire to the buildings . Confused shouts came from the strike-force barracks to our rear . To our left , near the American longhouse , stood one of the Cambodians ' barracks . In the flickeringlight of the fires I saw the Cambodes throwing combat harnesses64over their shoulders as they rushed out and split into two sections : one went to the north wall , the other to the south . " Goddamned good bunch , " Bergholtz said . " They were ready . " Toward the rear of the camp two of the Vietnamese strike-force barracks blazed . Agonized screams came from them . Falk winced . " God ! Some of those poor kids must have got burned up in their sacks . " The field telephone buzzed and Bergholtz picked it up . " Number four , " he said . He listened and then another whirring in the air made us huddle down . " Yes , " Bergholtz was saying . " Six hundred meters , 270 degrees . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another series of searing blasts tore across the camp . " Flash the light on the 270-degree aiming stake for me , Babe , " he said . Falk complied . Bergholtz stared through the mortar sight and cranked the correct azimuth and elevation into the weapon . " OK , charge four , give ' em four rounds of WP . " In rapid succession Falk exploded four shells out of the mortar tube . We waited for half a minute as the camp was rocked by VC mortars . Then the phone rang . Bergholtz picked it up , called his position number , and listened . " The tower says our WP 's on target . Fire HE now . " Falk reached for the high-explosive rounds and plopped four down the tube . The hollow reports of the camp 's other mortars sounded around us . Two positions were continuously firing illuminating rounds which lit up the fields outside with a sickly pale-yellow light . I sensed men runningtoward the bunker and pointed my carbine at them . " They 're ours , " Bergholtz called . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone rang and Bergholtz grabbed it . " Tower says we were right in them , " he reported . " Keep throwing it to ' em . " As Bergholtz and Falk with their two newly arrived Vietnamese mortarmen started lobbing high-explosive shells , I cautiously poked my head up and looked around the camp . Several of the buildings were burning . WP and HE rounds were exploding all around the camp . The smell of powder and explosives was everywhere . On the walls the strikers were peering out , holding their fire until they could see something to shoot at . It was a mortar duel for the time being , the spotters in the tower trying to call down our barrages on the65enemy weapons . Every unwounded man in camp was against the walls in the square sandbagged positions , which protected them from shell fragments bursting inside the camp as well as outside . The heat and smoke from the fires became intense and , as the WP shelling continued , the unmistakable and sickening smell of burning flesh wafted over the camp . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shouted , " Charge three . They 're moving in from the west and north . " The Vietnamese and American mortar crews were working smoothly and the rounds were pouring out of the camp just as fast , or faster than the incoming rounds were pounding us . Again the field phone rang . I became aware of the firing on the walls now . " Charge two ! " Bergholtz shouted . " They 're getting up to our outer wire . " We could hear our own rounds exploding just beyond the outer perimeter . The heavy machine guns along the wall were pumping bullets into the enemy . The whoosh of the camp 's 57-mm. recoilless rifles and rocket launchers came from the west and north walls . The phone to his ear , Bergholtz yelled , " Charge one ! " He made for the mortar tube , changed the elevation and went back to the phone . " They 're on the concertina ! " he yelled . The eerie , ear-splitting noise of incoming rockets followed by shattering explosions told us that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in trouble . All the bravado I had felt when insisting that Lieutenant Colonel Train let me stay seeped out of me . In the heavily sandbagged iron-ringed observation stand above the command bunker , Kornie and Train watched the progress of the attack . The Vietnamese camp commander was below in the nearly impregnable bunker , taking field telephone reports . A Vietnameseand an American heavy-weapons sergeant were in the tower directing the mortar fire . Borst , in the communications sectionof the main bunker , was keeping the B team appraised of the situation . Already flare ships were on the way to light up the battle . Meanwhile , our mortars , firing illuminating rounds , clearly lighted the outer perimeter of the camp , and into the circle of light a wave of black-uniformed men moved steadily forward . Many hours later Kornie told me how the battle had looked from66his position . Enemy rocket shells crashed into the barbed wire , opening rents toward which the Viet Cong headed . The attack was now concentrated on the west and north walls . Machine-gun and rifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dropping them in the tangled maze of barbed wire . Another Communist section charged the outer perimeter . The mortars were firing at minimum range now but the Communists came forward , many carrying ladderswhich they threw over the wire . Suddenly , incomprehensibly , the key northwest bunker machine guns began to rake our own west and north walls . Cambodes and Vietnamese preparing to charge out and meet the incoming Communistswere falling from the walls in crumpled heaps , either back into the camp or out onto the pungi stakes in front , which impaled their bodies . " Kornie ! " Train shouted . " What are those insane bastards doing ? " " We got VC in the strike force ! They 're on that bunker , " Kornie yelled back . He snatched his field telephone and cranked the handle shouting , " Schmelzer , get reinforcements ready to take the northwestbunker . The VC got it ! " Schmelzer 's position in a mortar bunker next to the operations room enabled him to watch at close range the fighting on the west wall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Captain Lan safely in the main bunker . Schmelzer pounded his counterpart to indicate he should get all the strikers he could to take back the northwest bunker . Cau and Schmelzer could both see the devastating fire from the bunker spewing death along the west wall in front of them . Lieutenant Colonel Train was appalled at the speed with which Phan Chau was seemingly falling apart . Then suddenly , shockingly , the northeast bunker started firing down the north wall , catching the hundred or more defenders in a murderous crossfire . Train turned to Kornie . " We 'll have to evacuate to the southeast . Borst can call for gun ships to pick us up . " " Colonel , " Kornie cried over the explosive din of the battle , " you are going to see how crazy and unconventional I really am . " He reached down to the floor of the observation post , kicked aside a sandbag and pulled out a box streaming insulated wires. 67In the light of the illuminating flares he studied the switches a moment . He threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then the northeast bunker exploded , their treacherous machine gunners silenced . Over the field phone Kornie yelled , " Schmelzer , take the two bunkers . " The first wave of Viet Cong were well through the outer barbedwireentanglements , not more than thirty yards from the walls . Kornie threw another knife switch on his detonating box . No less than a dozen simultaneous explosions rang out from the north wall , and the pressing mass of black-clad enemy crumpled beneath a lethal hail of jagged metal . " Claymores ! " Kornie yelled above the renewed firing . " Very good ! " Schmelzer and Lieutenant Cau had commandeered reinforcementsfrom the south wall and were making for the two smoking bunkers . Jumping into the northwest bunker Schmelzer riddled the wounded VC with his AR-15 , and the strikers behind him , Cambodesand Vietnamese , righted the overturned machine gun , dug ammunition belts out of the debris , pitched bodies over the wall and were set up and firing just as the next wave of Viet Cong broke through the outer defenses to threaten the walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire never ceased , killing and wounding strikers everywhere within the camp . A round dropped onto the main bunker , its concussion flinging Kornie and Train to the bottom of the observation post . The sandbagging saved them from being shredded by the blast of steel fragments . Kornie pulled himself up and looked out over the battle . By now an Air Force plane was circling overhead , dropping high intensity flares , and turning the battlefield into high noon . The mortars , relievedof the necessity of firing illuminating rounds , kept a steady rain of high-explosive rounds dropping on the attacking Viet Cong ranks . When Kornie and Train recovered from the blast they saw that the enemy seemed slightly slowed down . With both bunkers in actionagain and the north wall spitting a solid sheet of death , the first Communist bid for a fast victory was gone . The Viet Cong rocket launchers kept up a steady fire , though many of the missiles were flying high over the camp in an effort to knock out the tower . It68presented a small target , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mortar fire , since it acted as observation post . The bunkers were under incessant recoilless-rifle fire , which was furiously returned . Abruptly from the west came the sound of bugles . Out of the blackness of the foothills and scrub brush a few hundred yards away and into the bright light of the flares appeared over two hundred Viet Cong advancing on foot . At the same moment the VC were pressing in from the direction of the Cambodian border , the attack from the north was launched anew . In a vicious salvo of rocket fire , mortar-shelling , and heavy machine-gunning the VC swept through the scattered outer-defensebarbed wire and charged the north wall . Schmelzer in the damaged northwest bunker was now under fire from two sides . Thanks to the foresight of Rodriguez , who had laid his charges in all the bunkers the day before against just such a possibility , Schmelzer had both of the heavy machine guns in operation . Rodriguez had carefully placed the charges to do as little damage to equipment as possible , while killing or wounding every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north and west walls , the other on the southeast and southwest bunkers to make sure they did n't fall victim to similar treachery . Train was firing his automatic rifle now at the Viet Cong advancing toward the inner perimeter . The Communistswere within twenty yards of the north wall when LieutenantCau screamed orders from the bunker he had taken , jumped down outside the walls and headed straight for the Viet Cong . Over the walls clambered a platoon of screaming Cambodian and Vietnamese strikers with bayonets fixed and charged the Viet Cong . Bayonets ripped bodies , tore out throats , and after five minutesof vicious , bloody , hand-to-hand combat the VC advance was halted . Schmelzer now was able to turn both of his heavy machine guns on the Communists who were now breaching the western outer-defense perimeter . Kornie , watching intently from the observation post , reached for his black box . Again he threw a knife switch and a dozen claymoremines , trained on the western outer perimeter , went off . Black-clad enemy fell screaming , but others still came on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tanglefoot69barbed wire . In spite of the heavy fire streaking from the west wall the Communists advanced . Mortar shells fell with uncanny accuracyon our walls , knocking out sections of the inner defenses and killing or wounding the defenders . Through the western outer perimeter the Viet Cong streamed . Strikers rushed from the south and east walls to meet the new attack . Rockets tore out sections of the wall and reached for the machine-gun bunkers . The northwest and southwest bunkers were subjected to heavy recoilless-rifle fire . Only the north wall , thanks to Lieutenant Cau 's bloody counter charge , had successfully beaten back the Communist attackers . Kornie turned to Train . " It 's up to the men now , " he shouted above the firing . " We got no more claymores . I had no time to lay on my full dose of secret weapons . But I can still knock out the other two bunkers if VC get into them . " As Kornie watched the VC steadily advancing from the west through the barbed wire and withering fire , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blowing off the top machine-gun position . Kornie clutched the edge of his post and stared . The machine gun in the lower , heavily protected base kept up its deadly grazing fire about a foot above the ground . But the gunners and crew on top were blown into scattered pieces . Kornie knew Schmelzer had been helping direct the fighting from the vantage point of the top of that bunker . The VC , perhaps 50 of them , had reached the west wall and were trying to climb it . Hand to hand fighting raged . Train had set his AR-15 on semi-automatic and was picking away at the enemy from the observation post . The entire attack was now centered on the west wall . The camp 's mortar positions were still battering the VC at close range , helping to hold them back at the outer perimeter . From our mortar position we could see the VC clambering over the walls . Twice , figures in black pajamas fought their way into the camp and sprayed the defenders from the inside with automatic weapons until they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more VC begin to breach the walls . The Vietnamese strikers seemed to be losing heart. 70 " Hey , Babe ! " Bergholtz cried to Falk , " let 's give them a hand on the wall . The Viets can handle the mortar . " " You 'd better stay in here , " Bergholtz shouted to me needlessly , and firing his AR-15 as he went he headed for the wall . The two big bare-headed Vikings reached the walls and with savage yells plunged into the fighting . The unexpected appearance in the thick of the battle of the American giants , towering a foot above the combatants on both sides seemed to stiffen the resolve of the flaggingdefenders . The strikers flocked about the two Americans , and screaming curses their resistance became more ferocious than ever . Falk , firing his automatic rifle with his left hand , grabbed a bayonet-tipped carbine from a lunging VC , gave it a twirl and plunged it through a Communist 's back with such force that it pinned him , squirming , to the mud wall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelling , the strikers jumped from the walls , now cleared of live VC , and pursuedthe enemy into the area between the perimeters . Another American sergeant wearing his green beret jumped over the wall , rallying the strikers behind him . The impact of the fighting was irresistible ; shouting like a combatant , I leaped out of the safety of the bunker and ran for the wall . Looking down at the savage fight below , I could scarcely control the near-unconquerable impulse to jump . On the walls wounded strikers still able to fire weapons kept up a blast at the new squads unendingly breaching the outer perimeter . It seemed impossible that we could hold out against another determinedwave of these ferocious , suicidal Communists . Slowly our forces cleared the area outside the west wall , and the VC , hauling as many of their dead and wounded as they could with them , retreated beyond the outer perimeter . The strikers and the three American sergeants likewise retired behind their own walls again as renewed Communist mortar fire started falling . I heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A series of rounds plowed up the ground around us . When I pulled myself up I saw that Kornie had left his post and was standing behind the wall , assessing the damage . Bergholtz , his left arm gushing blood , and Falk , miraculously unwounded , ralliedaround him . The other sergeant who had gone out also came71back wounded . I recognized the slight figure of the demolitions sergeant , Rodriguez . His fatigues were blood-soaked around his chest and he staggered , both hands held above his right breast . " Where 's Schmelzer ? " Kornie asked . There was no answer . Kornie yelled the name of his executive officer into the strange lull in the fighting . There was no answer . " Our orders , " Kornie said hoarsely , " are for all Americans to exfiltrate the camp if we see it 's going to be overrun . We 're missingSchmelzer and maybe others . Falk , right now , find every American . Tell them to report to the control bunker . If anyone is dead try to drag the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do then . Move ! " Falk took off to search the positions assigned to members of the American team . Screams and begging cries of the wounded arose from all sections of the camp . Kornie looked at me and shook his head . " We can not hold against more than another company , two maybe . If they got another battalion they overrun us . " " How 's Train ? " I asked . " He 's in the commo bunker with Borst trying to get help over the radio . He 's been talking to the flare ships about getting fighter support . The God damn Vietnamese Air Force do n't fly at night and our nearest American fighters are at Soc Trang . That 's more than a hundred and fifty miles . " From out in the foothills , beyond the area which the faithful Air Force C-47 's were lighting up with flares , came the sharp , stinging notes of a bugle . It was joined by others . The bugles blasted fear into the hearts of the strike force who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , appeared . " Sir , " he said to Kornie , " I 've got three Vietnamese medics , two nurses and Sergeant Heimer working on the wounded . The dispensary'sbeen hit twice but we put out the fires . If we pull out of Phan Chau , sir , a lot of wounded are going to die . Bergholtz and Rodriguez are both pretty bad . They could n't walk far . " Kornie nodded in comprehension . " You heard those bugles , Ebberson ? Maybe they are bluffing or maybe they really got anotherbattalion . We 'll soon find out . But we got to be ready to evacuate through the southeast gate if we 're going to be overrun . Those are orders . " 72 " Yes sir , " Ebberson answered . " I ' 11 get the medical section ready . " " Have you seen Schmelzer ? " Kornie asked wearily . " No , sir . " Ebberson headed back for his dispensary . The bugles sounded louder now , as though they were closer . " Stay with me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walls . In the open parade ground he checked the fire arrow that indicatedthe direction of enemy strength . It was locked pointing due west at the attacking VC . Cans of sand , heavy oil and gasoline in them burning steadily , outlined the big wooden arrow . From the air , if help came , the pilots would know from the arrow where to strafe and drop their bombs . Kornie and I went up to his command post above the main bunker . The A team , except for Schmelzer , Train , Borst on the radio , Bergholtz , Rodriguez and the medics , gathered outside the main bunker . " Get inside , " Kornie commanded . " If I call down , head for the southeast gate . Borst will radio flare ships to illuminate only west of the camp . When we get out we head due east into the hills . And let us pray we do not run into our old friends , the KKK ! " The telltale whirring of incoming 60-mm. mortar rounds cut off further talk . The men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kornie and I remaining on top . " Oh , my God , " Kornie groaned . " Look . " The whole western approach to the camp , illuminated up to the hills , suddenly filled with black-uniformed enemy . Once again mortars smashed into camp . The shrill sounds of their bugles carriedclearly to us . Lieutenant Cau , wounded in the face , arm , and leg in the slashing counterattack , came up to Kornie 's post . " Sir , " the Vietnamese lieutenant reported , " I put almost every good man left in camp on west wall but a few men on other walls . What more advice you give me ? " " You and your men have fought well and bravely , Lieutenant . Where is Captain Lan ? " " Still in bunker . " Cau indicated below where we were standing . " My advice is give the VC bloody hell to the end , and you might say a few words to Buddha while you 're at it . " " I am a Catholic , sir . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning no irreverence . " You know , Lieutenant , the Americans have orders to evacuate  --  get out if they 're getting overrun . " " Yes , sir . We 'll cover you . I leave southeast bunker full staff to cover you . " " Thanks , Cau . If we get out of this , Lieutenant Colonel Train and I are going to see you make captain . " " Thank you , sir . Do not let them put me at desk in Saigon . " Cau saluted and in spite of his wounds limped to the west wall to commandthe final defense of Phan Chau . Kornie 's eyes were moist . " My God . When you meet one like Cau , you hate your guts for all the bad things you say about the Vietnamese . " Our mortars , still directed by the Vietnamese sergeant in the tower , which so far had proved impossible for the Communists to destroy , poured accurate destruction into the advancing ranks of the fresh VC battalion . " They want this place God damn bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken and now they 'll lose most of a third to get us . " The strike force opened up with their 57-mm. recoilless rifles and rocket launchers , but the black horde kept coming , fanningout as though they would hit the north and south walls as well as the west . The machine-gun tracers stabbed out at them , but they moved inexorably toward us . " This has to be it , " Kornie said . The remaining machine guns stuttered defiance as VC mortars continued to plow up the western section of the camp . Suddenly , the loud snarls from the sky we had all been desperatelyhoping to hear split the air . A flight of six T-28 fighter planes came out of nowhere , whipped low over our beleagured camp and opened up with their .50-caliber machine guns . Instantly , channels of broken , disintegrating bodies appeared in the ranks of the enemybattalion . At the same moment , brilliant white-hot pools of fire spread among the Communists as napalm bombs tumbled from the planes . Black-uniformed bodies burst into flame , moved a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screamed out their last . The74napalm bombs had crippled the attack . The T-28 's banked sharply , circled and came in for another murderous run . Still the Viet Cong would n't accept defeat . Every black-clad Communist still alive in front of us changed his direction of fire , and the sky became a pattern of crossing lines of tracer fire and bullets from automatic weapons . Into this near solid wall of crossfirethe pilots dove their planes . And then one of the low-flying T-28 's burst into flames . It streaked for the low hills , crashed , and the hills burst into an infernoof red flames . The other planes , as though in retaliation , came back for yet another run , shattering the fleeing remnants of the third Communist battalion with .50-caliber machine-gun bullets . The men on the walls screamed joyous cheers , jumping up and down , pounding each other . Kornie shouted his exhilaration at the sky . We watched the ragged Communist lines break and the skywardfire cease as the planes strafed and bombed the battalion to annihilation . Phan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let up , strafing the Viet Cong in pass after pass until there could not be a live Communiston the Vietnam side of the border . Finally the T-28 pilots made a last pass over the fiercely burning pyre of their comrade , pulled up into a barrel roll over Phan Chau and flew away . Train , in high spirits , appeared from the bunker where he had been talking on the radio to the pilots . " I asked them why they took so long , " he cried . " You know what those hot shots said ? They radioed back that Special Forces usually did n't require fighter assistance . They complained we usually beat off the VC before the planes could reach their objective and join the fight . " Soberly , Kornie gazed across at the fiery beacon on the hillside that had been a T-28 . Train followed his stare . " Yes , " the lieutenantcolonel said , " I feel very badly about that . They saved us . " " If we 'd had those 250 Hoa Haos that the politicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kornie could n't help saying , " we could have destroyed that third battalion ourselves . " " In any case , Captain , I 've never seen such heroic resistance . " " One thing , Colonel . You saw , I hope , that we would have been wiped out long before the air cover came if the VC had attacked75one day sooner . Only in the last twenty-four hours we put in those little tricks that saved us . " " Yes , Captain , " Train answered sternly . " I meant to ask you , is n't it a little unorthodox to mine your allies ' bunkers ? I do n't suppose you told your counterpart ? What do I tell Major Tri ? What do I tell Saigon ? That we place charges under our allies and do n't tell them ? " " My God ! " Kornie blurted out . " Tell the Vietnamese ? Every striker would know in a day 's time . Why the hell not send a radio message to Hanoi that at Phan Chau they 'd better not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time since I 'd known him . He pounded Kornie 's shoulder . " Kornie , relax . I agree . I am grateful to you for helping me understand this special unit of ours . " Then , looking around the carnage inside and outside the walls of the camp he said quietly , " Let 's see what we can do to help . Are all the Americans accounted for ? " Kornie shook his head sadly . " Schmelzer is missing . " He pointed toward the demolished northwest bunker . " That 's where he was last time I saw him , just before the VC 57 made a direct hit . " " Right , " Train said . " Let 's go see what we can do . And Kornie , next time you plan an operation like the one in Cambodia , will you invite me along ? It will make it easier for me to invent "  --  Train smiled  --  " plausible deviations from the truth when necessary . " THE IMMORTAL SERGEANT HANKSOne hundred and forty miles north of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seacoast , is the resort city of Nha Trang . Presently it is home to the Vietnam Air Force academy , the Army of the Republic of Vietnam ( ARVN ) NCO school , and the largest U.S. Army field hospital north of Saigon . For a year Nha Trang served as headquarters of U.S. Army Special Forces ; its central location made its large airfield an ideal logistical base for supplying the Special Forces A teams all over the country . By mid-1964 the Special Forces headquarters ( known as the SFOB ) was split , logistical control remaining in Nha Trang while the commanding officer of Special Forces and his intelligence and operations sections were moved to Saigon  --  where MAC-V and MAAG could keep closer reins on their unconventional activities . This story begins before the SFOB was split , during the time Special Forces enjoyed the autonomy which made many of its suc- cessful if occasionally unorthodox forays against the Communist Viet Cong possible . The SFOB was dominated by five huge white warehouses that dwarfed the complex of one-story barracks and of- fices ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At one end of the rows of barracks was the PCOD ( Personnel Coming Off Duty ) lounge known as the Playboy Club . Special Forces officers and enlisted men gathered and drank there together . At 5:00 one Saturday afternoon Captain Tim Pickins , one of the ASO 's ( Area Specialist Officers ) at the SFOB , and I were having a few drinks . The area specialists were my closest link to activities around the country , and Pickins and I had particularly good rap- port . We were talking about where I should go to get the best crack at a really good operation . " You gon na run out of luck you keep hanging around with A teams , " Pickins predicted solemnly . " What about you ? " 77 " You think I 'm gon na cash in now ? When I had an A team last year , maybe I could have got it . But now I only go out just enough to draw combat pay . " " Which is just enough to buy the six-by-two farm , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muc Tan . They 're pretty secure there . Least I would n't be worried about you getting greased . " I was protesting I did n't want to go where they 're secure , when the door to the club burst open and in walked a tall whip of a captainand a lean , grim-faced master sergeant . The men removed their green berets and came over to the bar . Pickins swiveled on his seat . " Hey , Hillman , I never figured on seeing you in tonight . Now that your replacements are here , and with things so nice down in Saigon  --  all those girls and bars . . . . " " It 's our PCOD , " said the captain . " We all got our blood tests and those as needed shots got them . Everyone 's ready to go home to his wife or girl nice and clean . " The master sergeant grinned . " Of course some of the team stayed in Saigon . They fixed themselves up with an APCOD . " At Pickins ' questioning looked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " " Yeah , " Hillman added , " and that young stud of an XO of mine , he 's staying down to Tuesday , worked himself out an AAPCOD with the doe . Absolute adjusted pussy cut-off date ! ' " We all laughed , and Pickins introduced me to Sergeant Rucker and Captain Hillman . " Where 's that poor sonofabitch who 's going to replace me ? " Hillman asked . " Captain Farley 's still over at the three shop getting briefed , " Pickins replied . " He and his team will probably be in here pretty soon . " " Good . I want plenty of time to tell him personally what a mess he 's getting into at Muc Tan . " " I heard things were reasonably pacified there , " I said . " With the VC , maybe . Christ , if all we had to do was fight the VC this war would be won damned soon . Our problem is the Viets right in our own camp . You 've heard of LLDB ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said stiffly. 7 8Disgustedly , Hillman turned to his sergeant . " Tell the man what LLDB stands for . " " Lousy little dirty bug-outs , ' " Rucker recited . " I 've seen some sorry LLDB types , " I agreed . " But I 've also seen LLDB officers and men who 'd stand up number one in any army in the world . " " That may be , " Rucker allowed . " I guess it just happened thatin my three tours in Vietnam I never drew a good LLDB team . " " Wait 'll you come back , " I said confidently . " The new CO ofLLDB is doing his damnedest to straighten his command out . " " I 'll believe it when I see it , " Rucker growled . " As you may gather , Captain Hillman 's team has been having some problems with their counterparts , " Pickins explained drily . Hillman glared at the area specialist . " If the colonel does n't relievethat camp commander , Lieutenant Chi , we might as well close up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bother us with Chi on their side . Yes , " said Hillman , ordering a second can of beer , " my replacement is in for trouble . Who is this Captain Farley ? Does he know anything about Vietnam ? " " He 's from the 5th at Bragg , " Pickins answered . " He 's never been here before . He 's a good man though  --  spent three years with the 10th . Just graduated from the Special Warfare School . " " Zack Farley ? " I asked . " He was in my class . I 'll have to go down and see him . " " You 'll see a man in trouble , " Hillman promised . " Sonofabitch , just once we got ambushed by the VC , and a LLDB sergeant with a greasegun would n't get up and charge . Know what I did ? I kicked his ass so hard he jumped up and his men followed him and we wiped out the ambush . And Lieutenant Chi ? He sends my name to Saigon for abusing Vietnamese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new detachment , sir ? " Rucker asked Pickins . " Sergeant Hanks . " " Ed Hanks . Damned good man . We were in Laos working for the Agency together in ' 62 . He 'll keep the team STRAC . " " I hope he 's got some other men with Vietnam experience , " Hillmansaid . " Those guys who come over from Bragg are usually firsttimershere . Now take the 1st at Okie . I do n't think there 's a man79who has n't got at least two tours in Laos , Vietnam , or  --  " He gave me a look and cut himself off , ending , " or some of the other places around here . " " If this war keeps going the way it is , " Pickins said , " every man in Special Forces will have one hell of a lot of Vietnam experience behind him . " The door opened and into the Playboy Club strolled Captain Zack Farley and his entire team . He spotted me and I jumped up and shook my old classmate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilians , and Pickins introduced him to the man he was replacing . Hanks and Rucker greeted each other happily and beers were orderedall around . " What the hell kind of morgue are they running here ? " Hanks asked boisterously after his first drink . " Every lousy barrack has a big sign on front and is named after some guy I know was killed over here . Jesus . Everhardt , Goodman , Cordell  --  I served under Captain Cordell , one of the finest officers in the United States Army  --  Brock , all of them . Damned near came loose just walking down here . " Rucker nodded . " I felt the same way . " Hanks pushed a beer at his captain . " Captain Farley , sir , " he said , " there 's one thing I want . And maybe Captain Pickins can do something about it too . If they grease me on this tour "  --  he paused , and then went on  --  " I just want one thing . Name the shit house after me . Someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shit , sir , I mean it . If my name 's going up on one of these buildings , make it one everybody uses . All those guys coming through here thinking of me for a few minutes each day . It would be like immortal . " Farley raised his beer . " If the time ever comes , I promise to do my best . " " Thank you , sir , " said Hanks , and ordered more beers all around . The rest of the evening , except for a brief chow break , Hillmanand Sergeant Rucker gave the new A team a profane , often obscene , and always derogatory toward the LLDB , briefing on what they could expect at Muc Tan . Before we broke up I promised ZackFarley that I would visit him at Muc Tan before the month was out . As it happened , two months passed before I had a chance to80make it to Muc Tan . Remembering all the warnings of Captain Hillmanand Sergeant Rucker , I was curious to see how Zack was doing . The dominating feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north edge of which the Special Forces camp is situated . Occasional areas under cultivation are cleared from the surrounding thick scrub brush and there are a few villages around the camp . The province capital is ten miles due east of the camp . The chief job of the Special Forces team at Muc Tan is border surveillance . The Cambodian border is ten miles to the west . The camp itself is only fifty miles from Saigon , to which daily convoys proceed . There is also the daily Air Force milk run between the provincecapital and Saigon . Muc Tan is considered almost a showpiece Special Forces camp by MAC-V , and it is here that visiting dignitaries are taken . There is always new construction work going on , the latrines are the newestand cleanest , the defenses are set-piece perfection and the Vietnamesestrike force is one of the country 's best disciplined . The area around Muc Tan , while not free of Viet Cong guerrillas , is at least so well patrolled that very few Communist raids on villages or ambushes occur . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning up . I might have put off the trip even longer had not CaptainPickins mentioned that a certain village near Muc Tan was suspectedof being an important way station for Viet Cong infiltrators from Cambodia . Captain Farley wanted to raid the village , but Pickins and Lieutenant Colonel Train thought up a more unconventionalplan . They would quietly surround the village , throw up barbed wire during the night , and then march in , hold every man and woman under arrest , and use the polygraph to interrogate them . Train felt that much more information could be derived this way . I decided to visit the camp in time to spend a couple of days with Farley before the operation . No one at the A team was expecting me when I arrived at the airstrip via the milk run from Saigon . The radio message that I was on my way got to Farley after I 'd been there about a day . However , I spotted a Special Forces sergeant sitting in a three-quarter ton truck . He watched me approach with some curiosity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name tape on my right breast and my jump wings sewed on my left , I wore no insignia on81my collar , of course , nor any on my green bush hat . On my back was a standard lightweight combat pack . My folding-stock carbine was comfortably slung over my left shoulder . Suddenly the medic from Farley 's A team , Sergeant Menzes , recognized me and jumped from the truck , telling me Captain Farleyhad been looking for me for over a month . Apologetically , he said we 'd have to wait a few minutes until he had picked up some supplies and mail . Along with several American advisers from variouscommands in the province and two American civilians , undoubtedlyUSOM people , I watched crates , boxes , trunks , and spare machine parts slid and lifted down the Caribou 's tail ramp . Sergeant Menzes finally found his deliveries and , slinging the packages in back , where four grinning Vietnamese strikers were sitting , he reverently placed the precious orange mailsack on the front seat between us and drove off . The roads to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listlessly watched the sides of the road for ambushes , and from force of habit I snapped out the stock on my carbine , chambered a round , and held it pointed directly up the road for instant employment . " Guess you 've been on some of them bad roads , " Menzes said with a chuckle . " The only trouble we 've got around here is with our socalledallies . " " I recall Captain Hillman and Sergeant Rucker telling you a few things about that , " I replied . " Did n't appear to me you all really took them seriously . " " We sure found they was right , sir , " Menzes said ruefully . " In fact , if anything things is worse . But I guess Captain Farley will tell you all that . He 's pretty disgusted . " The medic concentrated on his driving . " Nice road , " I said , " smooth , plenty of open space on both sides . " " Sure . This is the main road to the rubber plantation . Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it because the plantation pays off the VC to leave them alone . " Soon the entire south side of the east-west road was deep in rubbertrees . We drove for three miles before reaching the camp . True to what I had heard , this was the neatest Special Forces camp , the most perfectly laid out , I had ever seen . All the barracks were correctlyaligned snow-white cement-block structures with attractive , 82pitched-shingle roofs . The camp 's outer walls were straight , clean concrete embankments with perfect half-circle cement machine-gun emplacements all along them . At the entrance to the concertina , which stretched around the entire perimeter , two strikers in starched fatigues brought themselves up to attention and saluted smartly . We drove twenty yards inside the barbed-wire perimeter along the walls to the gate into the main fort . Again two immaculate guards came to attention and saluted as we drove through . I whistled appreciatively at the orderly , military interior . " Nothingwrong with this camp . " Menzes shrugged in reply and brought his truck up in front of the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerged . " Mail come ? " The medic tossed him the orange mailbag , and just as Hanks was turning to go back into his office with it he noticed me . He welcomedme profusely and took me along the row of doors to oneover which the sign COMMANDING OFFICER U.S. ARMY SPECIAL FORCES DETACHMENT A-799 shone out in gold letters on a bluebackground , perfectly matching the colors of the Special Forces shoulder patch . Captain Farley , seated at a metal desk , contemplating a sheaf of correspondence , looked up and came around to shake my hand . " Hiya , Zack , " I said . " If I knew what a nice camp you had I 'd have come here before on R and R. Where 's the swimming pool ? " Farley smiled wanly and showed me to a chair . " The mail came in , sir , " Hanks said . " I 'll sort it and bring yours in . Where shall I put our guest 's ruck , sir  --  in the guest room ? " " There 's an extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If we get attacked I 'll be able to watch him . " Both he and the sergeant guffawed loudly at this highly unlikely possibility . " You picked a good time to come , " Farley said when Hanks had left . " Pickins told me about the operation and I thought it might be interesting . " " I 'm not talking about that . It 's the last day of the month . Pay day for the strikers and construction workers . You 'll have a chance to see Lieutenant Chi in his best form . " " Hillman 's favorite counterpart ? " 83 " Even Hillman had n't caught up with this larcenous little genius . " He looked at his watch . " Come on , I 'll show you something . You remember my X0 , Lieutenant Cooke ? Well , he and Sergeant Reilly are supervising paying the strike force . You would n't believe it , I suppose , but we have one hell of a high desertion rate at this camp . " I showed my surprise . " Damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , conniving , cheating , politicking camp commander Chi has everything all figured out . " We started to cross the cement parade ground toward a building outside of which stood a long line of Vietnamese strike-force troopers . I stared at them  --  so unusual was it to see civilian irregulars looking so crisp and military . Farley laughed bitterly . " Oh they look good , all right . Christ , you 'd think we were back in garrison instead of out on the Cambodianborder . That 's how Chi keeps his embezzling going so successfully . This is the best-looking camp in Vietnam . We get inspectedabout three times a week . Any time a wheel wants to see a Special Forces camp , this is where they come . But Chi is so rough on his strikers , he 's such a damned stickler , that these civilian kids ca n't take it . About the middle of the month he starts shoving them in jail for five days if they have a shoelace untied . And the jail is something we do n't show visitors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishment . At least twice since I 've been here cobras have fallen in and bitten prisoners . Just the threat of the pit scares these strikers into deserting . But the Viet top brass think Chi is some military mastermind and any little disciplinary action he sees fit to carry out is fine with them so long as the visiting VIP 's are impressed . " Farley balefully watched the line of men move into the headquartersbuilding to receive their pay . " In the last eight or ten days Chi has scared at least fifty men , maybe more , into deserting . Then what he does is collect their pay for himself . He even stuck my interpreter into the pit for telling me how many men deserted last week . We got him out ; my men took him out by force before he 'd been in more than a couple of hours . Chi sent a radio message to the Vietnamese LLDB major at the B team that I was interfering84with his discipline . But Colonel Train knows the score now and told me to forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line of cleanly dressed , subdued strikers , and up to the table where two LLDB sergeants were sitting . The two Americans , Lieutenant Cooke and Sergeant Reilly , were passing them neatly stacked piastre notes , which they in turn passed to the strikers as they signed the paybook . LieutenantChi , a sullen-faced Vietnamese in the camouflage fatigues and beret of the LLDB , was standing behind the table watching the proceedings . " How many of them have you seen come through twice so far ? " Farley asked , not bothering to lower his voice for the benefit of the Viet paymasters . " I 've challenged about four of them , sir , " Sergeant Reilly answered . " But Lieutenant Chi and these swinging dicks "  --  he indicated the two LLDB pay-clerks with a jerk of his thumb  --  " started giving me a hard time and swearing the strikers I called were comingthrough legally . What are you going to do ? " " Why do n't you make them dip their hands in indelible ink each time they 're paid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes stared at me . Then Farley said , " We already tried it , but Chi sent word to Saigon that the Americans were insulting the integrity of the Vietnamese . That ended that . " A striker came through , looking nervously at the four men behind the stacks of money on the table . He glanced for a moment at Lieutenant Chi and then took up the pen to sign the paybook . " Hold it , " Lieutenant Cooke said . The striker paused with raised pen , looking up uncertainly . " I know goddamned well this one 's been through before , " the XO said . " What do you think , Ramsey ? " " I 'd say you 're right , sir . Goddamn it though , it 's sure hard to tell . " Lieutenant Chi approached the table . He said something to one of the Vietnamese at the table who repeated the camp commander 's words in Vietnamese to Cooke . " Lieutenant Chi says he has been watching carefully and this man has not been through before . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any money , " Cooke said , 8 5more in explanation to me than making a serious suggestion , " but he 'd be clean . Chi 's men take the money the minute these guys go through the line . If he 's a repeater , the only way he 'll get his own pay is if we give it to him now . If we do n't , there 's an investigation , Chi raises hell with the B-team commander , and we 're in for about twenty-five pounds of paper work and this poor guy does n't get paid . Shit ! " Cooke glanced back at Captain Farley . " We 'll pay , I just do n't like that little crook to think we 're absolute dickheads . " The money was paid , and the line progressed under the eyes of Lieutenant Chi . Cooke shook his head , his face grim with disgust . " These thieves give me such a case of the ass I do n't feel right for a goddamned week . " " Have you paid off the construction workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They come next . " " When you 've finished with them , come to my office and we 'll start tightening the old noose , " Farley said . " Reilly , I 'm sure glad you were a bookkeeper before you got into the Army . " " Yes , sir , " Reilly said enthusiastically . We left the LLDB headquarters , Farley and Chi exchanging correct , grim nods . Back in the office we said nothing for a few moments and then Farley spoke out . " Chi 's LLDB team right this minute is down at the contractor 's office on the north side of the camp . We always have a hell of a lot of construction work going on . They like this camp so much in Saigon that anything we want in new constructiongets the OK . And Chi , as camp commander , picks the contractor . He takes a piece from the contract or on his profits , and he 's got another trick . His LLDB team picks the workers from the villages around here . Every one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Americans get the blame for this because Chi 's men tell them that they kick back to us . The whole thing is a stinkingbusiness . And try and get Chi to go out on a combat patrol to the border ! " " So , Zack old man , what are you going to do for the next four months of your tour ? " " We 're going to establish an FOB on the Cambodian border and fight the VC . The hell with Lieutenant Chi 's garrison duty . " " And just how do you intend doing this ? " " Sergeant Reilly is my secret weapon , " Farley answered , smiling. 86 " He should be an FBI accountant . We have two Vietnamese interpreterson our side . The one we took out of the pit and one other . They 've been able to quietly get the names of all the deserters this month . It cost us some bribe money but it was worth it . Reilly can show on paper exactly how much Chi took this month on deserters . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our side . The interpreters even found out that Chi has been gambling in town . In the past two months he 's lost and owes the equivalent of $300 . That 's a hell of a lot of money for a lieutenant in the VietnameseArmy . We got a statement from his gambling friends that he is not only $300 in the hole but that he lost another $300 in cash . " It 's cost money but we 've built up a hell of a case . Just as soon as Reilly gets his figures laid out , I 'm taking the whole dirty mess to the B team . That 's as far as I can go . Then it 's up to Colonel Train . He said that up to now we did n't have real proof and accusationswould only drive a wedge between us and the Vietnamese . " " Is n't Colonel Train coming over for this operation ? " " Right . And his counterpart Major Tri too . But I do n't think this is the place to clobber Chi . We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a lot of other little surprises . Chi 's medics are stealing our antibiotics and selling them in town , and of course that stuff goes right to the VC . We 've tried to put a stop to that , but Chi complainsthat the Americans refuse to give them enough penicillin for their wounded . And that 's a goddamned laugh because we get so damned few wounded . " Farley stood up and paced his small office in frustration . He stopped at the map on his wall and hit it with his fist . " If we 'd go up here on the border where we 're supposed to be maybe we would have a few dead and wounded , but we 'd stop the VC from coming in through our area . " He looked at his watch . " There is n't a damned thing more I can do today . I need a little nerve tonic . " " I have some Jim Beam in my ruck . I 'm with you , Zack . " Half an hour later we were sitting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , an angry expression on his face . " Sir , Ho Vang Minh is missing . " Farley jumped up . " What do you mean , missing ? We have n't been out on any operations with Minh . " 87 " He 's missing right out of this camp . " " How can that be ? Minh would never go AWOL . " Farley turned to me . " Minh is our second interpreter . He 's been Reilly 's number one helper on this report we 're making . " " I think Lieutenant Chi knows what you 're doing , sir . Maybe he grabbed Minh . Lieutenant Cooke and Hanks and I went down to the pit but he was n't there . None of the LLDB are talking , you can bet the rest of that bottle of Beam on that . " Farley looked worried . " Well , have a shot while we try and figureout what happened . Where 's Lieutenant Cooke ? " " He 's trying to make the LLDB tell him where Minh is . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets us all in trouble , " Farley muttered . " Cooke has a way of getting physical when he gets the ass with our counterparts . " The captain took a long drink and set the glass down . " What could Lieutenant Chi find out from Ho Vang Minh if he had him over in one of their barracks now and was workinghim over ? " " If Minh talked , Chi would know that you have him by the nuts , sir , and are just waiting for the right time to squeeze . " " Minh is a good man , " Farley said grimly . " He almost makes up for the Chis . Minh 's the kind this country needs if it 's ever going to become a modern nation . Christ , I hope he 's all right . " The bourbon had calmed Reilly down a bit . " Sir , Sergeant Hanks and Lieutenant Cooke both figure that if Lieutenant Chi has been talking to Minh , he thinks you 're going to hit him with everything you got while Colonel Train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe he 's panicked . No telling what he might do . " " I just hope they do n't torture or kill him , " said Farley tightly . The next afternoon Lieutenant Colonel Train , Major Tri and Captain Pickins arrived at Muc Tan , and with them an American intelligence sergeant who carried a polygraph . A general briefing was held in the operations room . Lieutenant Chi was clearly suspicious of the whole mission . It had not been his idea . Captain Farley had requested permission from the B team and Train had taken to the plan and pushed it onto Tri . Even though his own man at Muc Tan had neither originated nor approved the mission , Tri decided he had better give his ap-88proval . The use of the lie detector on the spot so intrigued him he had come out to see the results for himself . In the briefing room Chi eyed the lie detector with an expression of mistrust and fear . By this time I had learned to understand the deviousness of the Vietnamese mind and I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coverup for an investigation into his activities , and the lie detector was to be used on him and his men . The new government in Saigon had made sweeping statementsabout ending graft and shooting any Vietnamese officer who embezzled more than 100,000 piastres , about $10,000 . The first test case had yet to be made , and misappropriation of funds and equipment was so prevalent that the new premier would lose a significant percentage of his officer corps if he tried to carry out his threat . Still , Lieutenant Chi was concerned ; the government might be forced into action if presented with a good enough case . Lieutenant Chi played the game all the way . As camp commanderit was his prerogative to conduct the briefing for this operationhe had not initiated , did not want to carry out , and believed to be merely a diversionary scheme of the Americans anyway . He now did so : The mission would start out at midnight , he began . Two platoons would leave camp . The first , advised by Sergeant Hanks , would start ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both platoons would follow a course of 225 degrees , or southwest , through the rubber plantation . Four miles on this course would bring the platoons out of the plantation onto a north-south road along the western edge of the rubber trees . From this point on the road Hanks ' platoon would follow the road south two miles until he reached the objective village . His platoon would block the north and west sides of the village . Farley 's platoon , ten minutes behind , would block the east and south sides of the village . Then the headquarters section , using bull horns , would tell the people their village was surrounded and no one would be shot unlessthe villagers fired first . Sergeant Hanks , firing flare rounds from the M-79 grenade launcher , would keep the village illuminated until dawn , as the headquarters and search sections moved in and started interrogating the villagers . It was hoped that an important89key to the infiltration route of VC 's through this province would be discovered . Lieutenant Chi was careful to point out on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubber-workers ' village which lay about a mile east of the road onto which the two platoons would emerge from the trees . Following their course of 225 degrees the two platoons would , during the course of their march , pass less than a mile from this village . Since it was suspected that not only the French owners of the plantation but most of the rubber workers were VC sympathizers , the ambush was a precaution against a possibleVC attack on the column from this village . Major Tri congratulated Lieutenant Chi for devising a fine plan of attack . He said that a thorough search and questioning of the villagers of the objective town should be of great value to intelligenceat the B team as well as at Muc Tan , which was doing such an excellent job of border surveillance . During the evening Captain Farley conducted a meeting of the Americans who would be going on the mission . Sergeant Reilly , saying that after all the paperwork he 'd been doing he thought he deserved a change of pace , was assigned to Sergeant Hanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had referred to , Captain Farley said it was something he 'd like to take up with the B-team company commander the next day . Train agreed . Sergeant Hanks stared at the acetate overlay on which positions and routes had been drawn in black and red grease pencil . Clearly he was bothered by the mission . Farley invited his team sergeant to speak out . " I do n't feel good about tonight , sir , " Hanks growled . " I do n't like that ambush Chi set up , without asking us about it , over by the rubber-workers ' village . " " His point was well taken though , sergeant , " Lieutenant Colonel Train interjected . " If there are VC sympathizers in the village they might try attack . " " Sir , " Hanks said slowly , " I 'm as security-conscious as a man can be , but there ai n't no hard-core VC fighters in that rubber village . Maybe a few of them have hidden some weapons they 'd dig up and use to shoot a lone American or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd never attack a squad , much less a platoon . You got ta remember , them Frenchies running that plantation do n't want no trouble . We know they pay off both the VC and Saigon to leave them alone . " " Good point , Hanks , " Farley said . " What do you think ? " Hanks looked uneasily at Train and then back at his captain . " I do n't know exactly , sir . I just do n't like it , is all . " " What do you want to say , Hanks , " Captain Pickins prodded . " You think those strikers Lieutenant Chi put out in the trees might be there to ambush us ? " Hanks grinned sheepishly . " Not after Chi told us where they were and gave us passwords in case we came too close to them . It 's just a feeling I got . " " You want to stay back , Hanks ? " Captain Farley asked . Then added , giving Hanks an honorable out : " You still got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , sir . I want to go . " " I 'll walk the first platoon with you , Hanks , " Pickins said . " If you want to , sir . I do n't trust these strikers on compass reading . I 'll be up at the point . " Exactly at midnight , Hanks , Pickins , and Reilly headed out with the first platoon of 50 strikers . Hanks walked directly behind the point man , Pickins positioned himself a few men behind Hanks , and Reilly took up the rear to prevent the inevitable stragglers gettingseparated from the platoon . The vague glow from the starlit sky clearly outlined the platoon in the darkness . The Americans loomed tall shadows , a head or more above the smaller strike-force troops . We watched the platoon disappear into the rubber trees on the other side of the road . Ten minutes later Farley led out his platoon , walking behind the point . I took my position several men behind the captain . At the rear of the platoon , Lieutenant Colonel Train , Major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Menzes , the medic , walked in a group , their special security squad behind them . It occurred to me that Lieutenant Chi should be up here with the point man . I whispered this to Farley , who shrugged . " For one thing I do n't want him up here , for another he said he91needed to be with Major Tri in case any questions came up . We 've got to keep noise discipline , " he added significantly . We snaked through the rows of rubber trees . The point man , leading the way , kept his compass in his right hand . After the entire platoon was in the trees I saw Farley pull out his own compass , take a reading , and slip it back in the pocket of his fatigues . I was glad to be up front . Train had wanted me to stay back with the headquartersgroup , but I liked walking as close to the point as possible . More than an hour went by , and I noticed that Farley , who had been constantly looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As nearly as I could calculate we should have passed the ambush Lieutenant Chi had put out about fifteen minutes earlier . It had becomea habit with me on night marches to keep a constant check on direction by watching the North Star , but in the dense rubber plantation it was almost impossible to get a look at the stars . We kept moving ahead ; we wanted to get out of the rubber trees and onto the road before taking the first rest . I calculated we were fifteen minutes from the road when Farley held up a hand and stopped the column . He reached into his pocket , pulled out his compass , and checked our direction . I saw him stiffen and tap the point man on the shoulder and show him his compass . There was a whispered discussion , through the interpreter , between Farley and the point man . I moved forward and heard Farley whispering angrily , urgently to his interpreter . A striker was dispatched to the rear of the column . " Watch out , " Farley whispered to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What happened ? " " The point man has been going on a course of 15 degrees right of the one Chi gave us at briefing . Instead of being on an azimuth of 225 degrees we 're choggying along on 240 degrees . That means we 're closer to the road than we thought , and north of where we had planned to come out . I should have checked my compass sooner . " " Then all we have to do is walk south on the road until we hook up with Hanks . " " That 's what we 'll do . But the point man just told me that a couple of minutes before we left Muc Tan , Lieutenant Chi told him to92follow 240 degrees ten minutes after we were out . I just sent back for Chi . If that sonofabitch is pulling something --  " The sudden crackling of riflefire broke out only a short distance ahead . " Get moving forward ! " Farley yelled , leading the way toward the firing . " Hanks must be getting it . " The interpreter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he raced through the trees . Flares were illuminating the area ahead . I could see the end of the tree line fifty yards ahead . The firing continued and more illuminating rounds lit the air . We could hear yelling ahead . Then , abruptly , all fire ceased . Minutes later we came across the first platoon , milling about at the edge of the road . Reilly was yelling and thrusting his AR-15 belligerently at an enemy I could not see on the other side of the road . I heard Pickins ' voice from somewhere , weak but commanding , repeating the same phrase : " Do n't shoot them , do n't shoot them , men . " Another illuminating flare burst above us as Farley and I reached the road . " Hanks ! Hanks ! " I heard Farley cry . " What hap-pened ? " The flare revealed the sickening sight . Sergeant Hanks was lying beside the road , the back of his head a broken red mess . Near him lay Pickins , still crying , " Do n't shoot them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the west side of the road , stooped over Pickins . " What happened , Babe ? " " Stupid fucking ambush in the wrong place . Our own strike force got us . " " You hurt bad ? " " No , I 'll be all right . " His voice caught and became a sob . " But Sergeant Hanks . He  --  " Slowly , Farley 's platoon advanced across the road , weapons ready to fire , Reilly on the verge of letting go at any moment . " Put that weapon down , Reilly , " Farley cried sharply . Slowly , Reilly obeyed . The strikers in the ambush party slowly came out of their positions . Through an interpreter Farley commandedthem to drop their weapons . They did so and walked out onto the road . Another illuminating round went up . " Menzes , " Farley said . " Help Captain Pickins . " I squatted beside Pickins , waiting for the medic . He looked up at93me , the yellow light of the flares giving his drawn face , lined with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd get greased you keep going around with A teams , " he said , with difficulty . " Do n't talk , sir , " Menzes said , kneeling beside the ASO . " You know "  --  it sounded as though Pickins was laughing , a grating , groaning laugh  --  " Hanks took it for Farley . Maybe you too . " Menzes opened his kit . " Do n't bother with me , Doc , " Pickins said . " Do what you can for the sergeant . " Menzes did n't answer . He gave Pickins a shot of morphine . I stood up and found Farley talking with Lieutenant Colonel Train and Major Tri . Lieutenant Chi had disappeared with a squad of his men into the trees when the shooting had started and could n't be located . Major Tri , who could speak good English when he wanted to , was saying that Lieutenant Chi must have tried to cut off the VC from escaping . " It was n't VC that ambushed us , Major , " Farley insisted . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only they were a mile and a half away from where they were supposed to be . Thanks to the bearing of 240 degrees Lieutenant Chi gave his point man on our platoon without telling us we would have walked right into it . " " Lieutenant Chi come back after catch VC , " Major Tri insisted . " VC ! " Farley yelled in exasperation . " That little crook deliberatelyambushed Sergeant Hanks . I 'll kill the bastard personally . " Tri gave his counterpart an injured appeal . " Farley ! " Train commanded . " Get hold of yourself ! " " Yes sir . Here 's Sergeant Reilly . Will you listen to him ? Tell the colonel what happened . " " Well , sir , " Reilly said , " we was following the azimuth given at the briefing  --  225 degrees . We checked it every ten minutes . No mis-takes . " Farley looked down at the ground and grimaced . He knew he had n't checked his point man frequently enough . " Well , sir , we got about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he 'd set out his ambush and Sergeant Hanks changed direction from southwest to due west to make sure we 'd give that ambush a wide berth . He said all the time he did n't trust Lieutenant Chi and figured he 'd try and get us. " 94Major Tri began loud remonstrances but Train held up his hand for silence . " Just the facts , Reilly . " " Yes , sir . So we turned due west and headed for the road , figuringwhen we hit it we 'd turn south and meet you . " " What happened , " Farley broke in , " they hit the road where we would have , following the course Lieutenant Chi gave our point man . They just hit it a few minutes ahead of us and ran into the ambush set out for us . " " That 's jumping to conclusions , Captain , " Train said sternly . " They got Hanks , but Chi wanted me . " " Why would your counterpart do a thing like that ? " Train asked in genuine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been stealing at Muc Tan . " Major Tri 's multilingual protest was silenced by the arrival of Sergeant Menzes . " Sir , " he said to Farley , " I fixed up a litter for Captain Pickins . Can we go now ? " " You 're damned right we can , Sergeant , " Colonel Train boomed out . " Let 's get out of here . " Due to good radio work , a helicopter was waiting at Muc Tan to evacuate Pickins when we arrived back . His wounds were n't serious , but they wanted to get him to the naval hospital in Saigon as quickly as possible . The chopper also took out the body of Sergeant Hanks . At dawn the next morning there was still no sign of Lieutenant Chi . Major Tri , insisting that he must get back to the B team immediately , said that he knew Lieutenant Chi would come back as soon as he had finished chasing the VC . " What are you going to do about Lieutenant Chi , sir ? " Farley asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered wearily . " I 'll lay all the evidence before the Vietnamese authorities . I do n't see how there can be any doubt that he planned to ambush and kill you , but for God 's sake do n't anyone talk about the incident . " He looked hard at me . " We 've got enough problems over here now . I 'm sure the Vietnamese authoritieswill take care of Lieutenant Chi once and for all . Captain , 95do n't do anything stupid when and if Chi comes back to this camp . You know what I mean ? " " Yes , sir , though after what happened it 's asking one inhuman damned lot . " Train nodded . " That 's why Special Forces have these jobs , Captain . We 've got a sonofabitch job over here . I 'm sorry , Zack . If you think of anything I can do for you before my chopper comes let me know . " " I 'll meet you in the teamroom , sir . " I accompanied Farley to his room where , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a long pull . He offered it to me and I did the same , then passed it back . Farley took a long last one and tucked the nearly empty bottle away . The sun had risen as I walked across the parade ground into the A-team longhouse . I sat down beside Train , who was meditatively sipping coffee . There was n't much for us to say . We just drank coffeeuntil Farley came in . He took a seat opposite Train and after swallowing half a cup of coffee said , " Colonel , I just thought of one thing you could do for the team , for Sergeant Hanks . " Train replied almost eagerly . " I 'll do my best . " He took a deep drink of his coffee . In quiet tones , Zack told him about Hank 's request back at the SFOB . Train sputtered and put the cup down , staring at Farley to see whether the captain was gulling him . " It 's true , sir , " I said . " I was there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought a moment . " I 'll see what I can do , Farley . I promise you I will . " Two weeks later , in Saigon , I went to the naval hospital to see how Captain Pickins was coming along . His wounds were draining and he looked reasonably comfortable . " By the way , " he said , giving me a wan smile , " whatever happened to that sonofabitch , Chi ? " " You really want to know ? I do n't want you to have a relapse . " " Say no more . They transferred him to another A team in anothercorps area . " 96I nodded . " My buddies in personnel at the B team report he 's camp commander of a new base in eye ' corps . Lots of construction work going on there , they tell me . The Vietnamese told our B team up there that Chi had a lot of experience with contractors and workers . Pickins stared wordlessly at the ceiling . " But there 's one thing , " I said . " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Had a touch of dysentery and spent some time in the enlisted men 's latrine . " A slow smile began to spread across Pickins ' face . I nodded . " You ca n't miss it . A big sign freshly painted is right out there in front of it , big as life . It reads Hanks ' Latrine . " ' f9THE CAO-DAI PAGODACaptain Dewart paused during the tour of his camp he was giving me to stare balefully at the decrepit hut , sandbagged nearly to its thatched roof . Hanging from the eaves was a faded blue board with a large human eye painted on it in white and green . Some Vietnamese words were lettered along the top . " What is that thing ? " I asked . " That , " he said disgustedly , " is the bane of my existence . Be- cause of it , this camp of mine is unfinished  --  probably will never be finished . " " What do you mean ? " " Friend , I 'll have you know what you 're looking at is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now was attended by one old lady , who could n't have cared less if it fell apart . " " What happened , " I asked . " She get religion ? " " Not her , but the local Cao-Dai Buddhists have suddenly decided this pagoda is very sacred to them . The Cao-Dai elders say we un- enlightened Americans have desecrated their temple . " I was a bit confused , and said as much . " How did a pagoda find its way into the middle of your camp ? " Dewart laughed . " It did n't exactly find its way in . As a matter of fact , I built the camp around it . This happens to be the most stra- tegic place in this district for an outpost . As you see , we have a river north of us , and the canal runs across the river at right angles to our west . South and east we have clear fields of fire except for that patch of jungle along part of the south wall which I 've been trying to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two battal- ions to overrun us . " " And this pagoda was standing right where you had to build the fort ? " " Correct . But first I talked to the old woman . She said she was the only Cao-Dai left who used the place and agreed to let me build98her a new one somewhere else when the camp was finished . So we went ahead with the camp . The first thing I did was sandbag the pagoda and use it for an ammo dump . " Dewart tugged off his green beret and stood bareheaded in the sun . " I 've never seen a Cao-Dai pagoda . Mind if I take a look ? " " Help yourself . There is n't much to see . " I walked across the open square past partially built buildings and entered the door under the sign . Ammunition cases were piled to the ceiling left of the door , taking up about half the interior . To the right was a large dark wooden table or altar , and above it , nailed to the wall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the CaoDaisect . All around the eye snakes and trees were painted giving the impression that the eye was staring out of some hideous jungle . There were some candles and tapers on the altar . More pictures of eyes adorned the other walls . Straight out of Salvador Dali , I thought . Leaving the pagoda I found Captain Dewart in conversation with a burly middle-aged civilian . " This is Mr. Brucker from Research and Development at Fort Belvoir , " Dewart said , introducing me as a writer friend from Fort Bragg . " Mr. Brucker is trying out a new gimmick with us , a radio-detonatedmine . We have n't had a chance to use it in combat yet , but I 'm sure we will . " " I 'd certainly like to know what you think of the device , " Brucker said . " If you send your report to Saigon , I 'll be in Vietnam for anothertwo or three months . " Suddenly from above the river I heard a whirring , rattling noise in the air , and threw myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Brucker remained standing above me , and I felt my face flush with embarrassment as I looked where Dewart was pointing . A flock of birds following the edge of the river flapped their way over the camp . " I see you 're as fireshy as the rest of us , " he said , grinning . " Been out here long ? " " Long enough , " I answered , standing up and brushing the reddish clay dust off my combat fatigues . " Did the same thing myself first time I heard them birds last evening , " Brucker chuckled. 99 " I do n't know what it is with ' em , " Dewart said . " They come over every evening regular as taps in garrison , and they sure do sound like incoming 60 mm. ' s . " " Well , Captain , " Brucker said , " my chopper should be along pretty soon . If Sergeant Rutt is around I 'd like to talk to him before go . " Dewart looked off toward the entrance to the camp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate . Rutt 's using that radio bomb of yours to blow it . He 's like a kid with a new toy . Never saw a happier demo sergeant . " A sharp blast rolled across the camp . " I guess it works , " Dewart remarked . " I 'd better go see for myself , " Brucker said , leaving Dewart in bitter contemplation of the pagoda . Captain Dewart had briefed me on the whole incredible story of what had happened to his detachment since its arrival in Vietnam . Two months earlier his area had been pacified , so he split his detachment , leaving half his men to guard the old camp and finish turning it over to the Vietnamese . With two Civilian Irregular DefenseGroup companies his group marched through jungles and mucky rice paddies to reach a new location he had picked out by helicopter reconnaissance deep in the heart of hitherto unchallengedVC territory . The first ambush was not unexpected . The CIDG reacted well , charging into the ambushers and letting go with all their fire power . Two CIDG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two companiescontinued on toward the new campsite . Two days later , almost within sight of the new location , the VC 's hit with another ambush , this time using a mortar . Discipline broke , Dewart 's company fled , and he and Sergeant Rutt found themselves with only one Vietnamese sergeant who had vainly tried to rally his dispersing forces and organize for an attack . Dewart led Rutt and the Vietnamese sergeant in a three-man charge on the VC ambush . Quickly they moved inside mortar range and Dewart killed three VC with his AR-15 , the rounds from this lightweight powerful weapon destroying the VC bodies so thoroughlythat the Communists had not even tried to carry them away . Rutt stepped into a pungi pit , but Dewart and the Vietnamese ser-100geant broke up the ambush and destroyed the mortar with a thermite grenade down the tube . Then Dewart pulled Rutt out of the trap . The sharp stakes had been unable to pierce the sheet metal in the soles of his boots , but the sergeant 's knee had been painfully twisted . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying Rutt , finally rounded up the second CIDG company , which had been joined by his own " bug outs . " They were several miles from the objective location . Radioing for a helicopter evacuation of the dead and wounded , Dewart urged the men on , and just before dark they reached the site of what would become the new permanent camp . " As soon as the VC saw we had a strong fort going up right in the middle of their territory they attacked . We beat them off , killed eight and lost only one friendly . They have n't hit us again . Now "  --  he turned from the pagoda as though the sight pained him  --  " they 're trying something else  --  seeing if they can knock us out without spillinga drop of blood . They 're smart , the VC . Damned smart . They 've been terrorizing the local Cao-Dai people hereabouts , making them complain all the way up to Saigon that the Americans are desecratingtheir sacred temple . They 're saying the government should make us leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country feel about religion , especially after the way Diem and Nhu persecuted the Buddhists . " " They would n't really make you move , would they ? " " They damned well might . Look around . The whole place is halffinished . No roof on the teamhouse . The dispensary not built . Bunkersunfinished on the walls . We have orders not to spend any more money until this Cao-Dai dispute is settled , and that wo n't be for almost a month . We ca n't get enough troops to secure this unfinishedfort and still send out effective patrols in company size . No matter what happens , the VC have gained at least a month without harassment . Yesterday a full colonel , American , came through and said there was a fifty-fifty chance we would have to relocate because Big Minh does n't want to offend the Cao-Dai sect . " " It 's a damned shame , especially with so good a location . " " Shame ? " Dewart sputtered . " It 's a goddamned tragedy if we 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . " 101A Vietnamese interpreter approached and saluted smartly . Dewartreturned the salute and clapped the beret back on his head . " Dai-uy , Cao-Dai elders at the gate wish to visit the pagoda . " " How many ? " Dewart asked . " Maybe 20 . " " Twenty ! " he exclaimed looking at me . " The old woman said there had n't been a dozen people in that pagoda since it was first thrown together . " " They are here , Dai-uy . It is the time of the full moon . " " All right , Lang . Let them in . But search them first . " " Dai-uy , " Lang protested , " I can not search priests and elders . " Dewart swore beneath his breath . " See what I mean ? Saigon says we have to be careful not to hurt their sensitive feelings . " He made an impatient beckoning gesture at the group of men standing around the gate and Lang went off to escort them to the pagoda . Dewart watched carefully as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , filed past . He did not miss the way the eyes of many of the worshippers flickered about the inside of the camp , noting the mortar and machine-gun mounts . " What kind of war are we supposed to be fighting when we invitethe enemy in to look the plant over before they attack , " " Those are elders , sir ? " Dewart turned to Sergeant Penny , his tall Negro medic . " That 's what Lang says . " He raised his voice . " Hey , Lang , come here . " The interpreter turned up on the double . " I thought you said they were priests and elders . Most of those swingers are n't more than thirty . " " Dai-uy , " Lang explained , " they are ranked by their strong belief , not their age . " Penny looked at him suspiciously . " Are you a Cao-Dai ? " " No , " Lang replied . " But we are all Buddhists . " Dewart dourly watched the procession file past the sandbagged entrance into the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ammo they 'll think twice about attacking us again . " Lang objected . " The Cao-Dai are loyal to the new government , Dai-uy , and they never fought beside the VC even though they hate Diem . " 102 " How many of those studs that just passed do you think are really Cao-Dais ? " " They all say they Cao-Dai , Dai-uy . " " Sometimes I wonder whose side you 're on , Lang . " Dewart turned to Sergeant Penny . " Tell our guys not to take their eyes off these religious zealots for one second . " " Just look around you , sir , " Penny replied . Dewart did so . Except for Sergeant Rutt , earnestly engaged in conversation with Brucker , all the Americans were standing on the walls or in strategic locations , their AR-15 's held in readiness , their eyes shifting from the Cao-Dais to the fields outside the walls and back to the Cao-Dais again . Another flock of river birds whirred and rattled overhead . Many of the Cao-Dais reacted like soldiers  --  as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until they realized these were not incoming mortarrounds . Suddenly Dewart laughed aloud . " I 've got the answer ! " I looked at him questioningly . " You hang around , I 'll show you how we 're going to take care of those spook-sheeted dickheads . " Patiently he waited for the Cao-Dais to finish their supposed prayers in front of the grotesque paintings . Finally they filed out again and one of the leaders , a young man with a crafty glint in his eye , beckoned the interpreter and spoke to him in low tones . Lang returned to Dewart . " Dai-uy , tomorrow is the night of the full moon , and the CaoDaiwish to return to worship at their temple . " Dewart 's decision was a tough one . The security of the camp depended upon his CIDG strike force and their Vietnamese Special Forces or LLDB leaders  --  Buddhists to a man . Though they might well suspect the local Cao-Dais , one hundred and fifty miles from the sect 's main strength in Tay Ninh province , were being terrorized into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all shared was stronger than most Westerners could realize . This was particularlytrue since only a few months earlier Buddhists in Vietnam had been persecuted , jailed , and tortured by adherents of Catholicism , a predominantly Western religion . " Let me talk to the Cao-Dai leader , " Dewart said. 103The interpreter returned with a delegation of three men . One , spare and truly old , clad in a loose white robe , a fibrous , forked white beard hanging from his chin , was introduced as the chief elder . The second was a cunning young Vietnamese , and the third , a young Oriental who wore his surly expression as a challenge and was dressed in the black pajamas common to Vietnamese peasants  --  and the VC . Dewart addressed himself to the elder through Lang . " I am told you want to come into this camp tomorrow night . " The old man shifted his feet and then answered in a few mumbledwords . " The Cao-Dai elder , " Lang translated , " says it is the end of the lunar month , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are expecting a VC attack any night , " Dewart said . " It would be most dangerous for you to be in the camp during such an attack , especially since the VC must know we have been storing our ammunitionin the pagoda . " Dewart watched the derisive expression come to the faces of the two younger men . They began talking back to Lang , ignoring the old man . After a few moments Lang turned to Dewart . " They say there are no VC here . They say even if VC were here the VC respect religious nights and pagodas . " Lang paused , apparentlyembarrassed to go on . " Keep talking , Lang . What else did they say ? " " They say VC have more respect for religion than Americans who helped ex-President Diem burn pagodas and who even now store the materials for war in a sacred Cao-Dai temple . " Dewart nodded gravely . " Tell them , Lang , that Americans respectall religions . And to prove it , tell them that tomorrow we will move our ammunition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful and they have the ear of the generals in Saigon . Tell them we will permit them to come in tomorrow night for one hour during the full moon . We are sorry it can not be longer , but because of the VC attack we do not want civilians endangered . Ask them what hour they would like to come . " With triumphant smirks the young men replied to the translation . The elder remained impassive and silent . " Dai-uy , they say again no VC will attack this post tonight or tomorrow night . " 104 " How do they know that unless they are VC themselves ? " The dart translated brought a surprised look to the young men . They muttered to Lang . " They say they will come into the camp at 11:00 tomorrow night . They say also that the Americans must move this camp away from the sacred Cao-Dai pagoda . It was built by one of the first Cao-Dai elders to come here from Tay Ninh . They do not want another pagodasomewhere else , only this one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know we must help the Cao-Dai who are allied with the new government . They may come into camp tomorrow night at 11:00 for one hour . " Lang looked at the captain in surprise . " Dai-uy , do you think it is good to let them all in tomorrow night ? Some of them might be VC . " Dewart professed shock . " Why , Lang , you were just telling me the Cao-Dai are loyal . And you did n't even want to search them . Tell you the truth , I thought you were on their side . " " I did not mean to seem that way to you , Dai-uy . " " You tell the Cao-Dais what I said . And then you find the LLDB camp commander and tell him I have agreed to cooperate with our Buddhist friends if he gives permission for them to come in and pray tomorrow night . You tell those Cao-Dais if they are not allowed in tomorrow night it is because one of their fellow Buddhists does n't trust them , not the Americans . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his heel . " OK , here it is , " he announced as we reached the gate where SergeantRutt and the R and D man were happily discussing demolitions . " Brucker , I believe you are Heaven-sent , or should I say Nirvana-sent . " Dewart then explained his problem with VC-dominated local Cao-Dais . " I do n't think you should let them in tomorrow night , sir , " SergeantRutt said . " We wo n't have to , because you and Mr. Brucker are going to fix things up for me . " He and the R and D man went into a huddle . I heard something about getting Rutt squared away on a radio-controlled series of explosions. 105That night I sat around with the team in the unfinished , unroofed teamhouse , all of us dressed in black Vietnamese pajamas . " I always wondered how the camp commander would react in case of an attack , " Sergeant Rutt mused aloud . " Looks like we 'll find out , " said Sergeant Penny . " You sure you got them claymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them so they 'd fire at a 40 degree angle . When they start spitting shrapnel it will sound as though the stuff is going past your ears . But do n't sweat it , those pieces of metal will be flying fifty feet above the walls . " " Well , I hope so , " Penny said . " I do n't want no more medic work tonight . Near 100 people came down the canals in their sampans to my sick call today . " Captain Dewart finished the letter to his wife and sealed it in an envelope . " I 'm about ready to get some sleep . It 's 10:30 . What say we get this VC attack started and over with . " " Anytime you say , sir . " Rutt went over to a table on which was what appeared to be a small radio transmitter sprouting a three-foot antenna . There were two knobs for adjusting transmission frequencyand band and a vertical row of toggle switches down one side . The only thing missing was a microphone . Everyone stared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OK , Rutt , no time like the present , " Dewart said . " Let 's have the first VC attack ' from that patch of jungle near the south wall , the place I 've been trying to get Captain Bao to clean up . " " Right , sir . " Rutt picked up the radio detonator . " OK , you guys , everyone down behind the sandbags . Those claymores just might fire low . " The team crouched behind the sandbagged wall of the all-butrooflessteamhouse . " Here goes ! " Rutt toggled a switch and a sudden , sharp explosion rent the night air . The nerve-jangling whine of shrapnel from the claymore mines screamed over the camp . Instantly , all the machine guns on the jungle side of the camp opened up with a vengeance . The loud , shrill tweeting of a police whistle attested to the fact that the camp commander was alert and rallying his troops . " It 's a good thing we got more ammo than we know what to do106with , " the weapons sergeant laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quit shooting ' til they run out . " After more than five minutes with no incoming fire , the chatter of the machine guns died out to sporadic bursts . " Guess we 'd better goose them again from the jungle , " Dewart said . " One more VC wave coming in , sir , " Rutt acknowledged . He toggleda switch . Another blast from outside the camp , followed by the whine of shrapnel . Savagely the machine guns chopped at the jungle again . " OK , give it to them from out where the mortar rounds ' are goingto come from tomorrow , " Dewart commanded . Rutt toggled twice . Two thunderous blasts from the rice fields to the east , and the corner bunker machine-gunner switched from the jungle and cut loose across the rice paddies . There was more whistle blowing and the troops moved to reinforce the east wall . " That 's enough , " Dewart ordered . " Safety that radio detonator , Rutt . " Machine-gun and riflefire continued to cut through the night . Bao , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VC at-tacking ! " The American shook his head . " Just a probe , I think , Dai-uy . Did your men see any VC ? " " Yes , many , " Bao answered in excitement . " They come from junglebut we too-much shoot . Kill maybe five , maybe ten . " " How about from the east ? " " Yes , they come . But we too-much shoot . They go away . Maybe they come back with more men . " " Not tonight , " Dewart replied with assurance . " They did n't lay any mortars on us . You have good alert men , Dai-uy . Congratulations . We Americans sleep well knowing our Vietnamese friends always ready for VC attack . " The LLDB captain smiled at such high praise from his American Special Forces counterpart . The next morning Dewart suggested that Bao send out a patrol across the rice paddies to look for signs of a VC buildup . Reluctantly , the camp commander agreed to send two platoons . " Maybe107too many VC in jungle past rice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our men be ambushed by too many VC . " " No , Dai-uy , " Dewart reassured his counterpart . " Our men can handle the VC , and besides , " he paused to give full significance to his next statement  --  " we can cover them with very accurate mortar fire from here . Good thing , too , because at that range a good VC mortarman can lay a round in your lap if he wants to . " Sergeant Rutt took the patrol out , and Dewart asked Bao to order a detail of his men to help transfer the ammunition from the CaoDaipagoda to temporary bunkers some distance from the Buddhist house of worship . " The Cao-Dai should be pleased with our respect for their religion , " Dewart said to Bao as the last of the heavy ammunition crates was wrestled from the shrine . Bao agreed . " I am not Cao-Dai but we all Buddhists . " After a moment he added , " I no like we leave this camp only because of pa-goda . " Dewart shrugged . " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We OK . I no like Cao-Dai come in camp tonight . Maybe VC come in too . " " Then tell them they ca n't come in , " Dewart suggested . " No , " Bao replied positively . " In Saigon tell province chief , districtchief we must "  --  Bao paused , searching for the words in English  --  " wemust work with Cao-Dai . In Saigon they no think Cao-Dai here work with VC . We think maybe VC make Cao-Dai work with them . But we no tell Saigon . Saigon tell we . " Dewart turned to me with a grin . " You know , he 's got a good point . It 's the same in every army . What the general at the top says goes , no matter how far away and how wrong he is . " Late in the afternoon Sergeant Rutt and the two CIDG platoons returned . " Dai-uy Bao , " Rutt reported , " we see many signs of VC . They are watching us . " Bao nodded somberly . " VC all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They need two , maybe three battalions to overrun us , " Dewart speculated . " They will harass us ; they will give us mortar rounds " - he paused , then went on  --  " but VC do not want three , four hundred men dead just to take this place . " 108Bao nodded thoughtfully . " Are the Cao-Dai chiefs coming back this afternoon ? " Dewart asked . " Yes , " Bao answered . " Old priest and other two . They come see pagoda with no guns , no ammunition store in it  --  like you promise  --  so all is good for pray tonight . " " That 's fine , Bao . Very good . Have Lang call me when they get to the gate . " Dewart led Sergeant Rutt and me into his thatched-over corner of the teamhouse . " How did you do , Rutt ? " " Fine , sir . I placed the three charges . They 'll sound like mortar rounds being fired . What about the three charges in camp ? " " We put them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lyons to make sure you have them set up in the right order on your radio detonator . " " Yes , sir . Say , this is a real precision operation , " the demo sergeantsaid . " Mr. Brucker would sure like to have a written report on it . " I do n't need a court-martial this year , thank you . My wife 's havinga baby . Now get busy . I want to pull this off just right , while the old Cao-Dai and his two VC hoods are in camp . " " Yes , sir . " " And Rutt , watch me closely for the signals . " " No sweat , sir . " It was 5:00 when the Cao-Dai elder and his two hard-eyed advisersarrived at the gate . Lang , a gracious Captain Dewart , and a worried Captain Bao greeted them . The two young men sneered openly to see they had succeeded in forcing the Americans to removetheir war supplies from the pagoda . The Cao-Dai priest , white robes gathered around him , walked into the shrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and through Lang announced there would be many Cao-Dai in for prayer that night when the moon was full . " How many Cao-Dai will come in tonight ? " The two youths flanking the old man snapped some words to Lang , who appeared concerned as he turned back to Captain Dewart . " They say 30 to 40 members of the sect have gathered for prayers tonight . " 109 " Maybe 40 men , " Bao repeated . " That is bad . " " Maybe you say no . Explain later to the district chief , province chief , and Saigon , " Dewart suggested blandly . Bao shook his head . " But we watch them hard all time , " he said vehemently . Dewart bowed slightly to the two defiant young Vietnamese and the captive Cao-Dai priest . " Lang , tell the Cao-Dai leaders that we will be expecting them tonight . " Lang translated . The Cao-Dai elder placed the palms of his hands together and held them toward the American , bowing his head slightly . His two companions stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the pagoda toward the gate . Everything depended upon the river birds flying over at the regulartime . Dewart looked up the river . I followed his glance . There they came , right on schedule , heading for the camp . The white birds were about half a minute away when Dewart made a sign with his left hand . Rutt nodded and then a low , distant pop resounded to the east . Dewart significantly cocked his head . A second bang rumbled across the rice paddies , then a third sharp pop . " You hear that , Bao ? " " VC fire mortar at us from east ! " Bao cried . " Soon hit ! " The camp commander shouted a warning in Vietnamese at the Cao-Dai elder . The two Communist hoods turned back toward the invitingly-secure sandbagged pagoda , surprise and fear mirrored on their faces . The biggest lack in VC guerrilla war was communications . I restrained a laugh , reading the minds of the two young Communists . Someone had n't given them the word , they were probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harass the American camp ! Out of the corner of my eyes I saw the birds . Then came the whirringrattle from above . " Incoming ! " Dewart yelled . Lang screamed the warning in Vietnamese . The old Cao-Dai priest was knocked to the ground in the sudden dash his two young advisers made for the safety of the heavilybunkered pagoda . Bao jumped to the aid of the old Cao-Dai priest , sheltering the holy man 's body with his own . Dewart slapped an armlock on Lang who had turned toward the110pagoda and threw him to the ground . Gingerly , I lay down on a grassy spot . When he saw the two Viet Cong had made it inside the pagoda , Dewart gave Rutt the signal . Three successive explosions swelled the ground under us , concussion waves knocking the breath out of me . This seemed overdoing realism . Slowly Dewart regained his feet , pulling his frightened interpreterup beside him . Captain Bao helped up the shaken Cao-Dai priest and slapped some of the dust out of his robes . Dust and debriswere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walls the BAR 's had opened up , spraying the area east of the camp with heavy fire . The first blast had torn out the sandbagging and the outer wall of the camp for a radius of three feet along the river . The second blast had walked back and exploded halfway to the center of camp , blasting a sizeable crater in an open area but doing no damage . Shaking uncontrollably , Lang stared at the results of the third explosion  --  whathad once been the Cao-Dai pagoda , the refuge he was seeking when Captain Dewart threw him to the ground : a huge cloud of settling dust , bits of building material and thatching hung above a smoking crater . Bao stared incredulously at the wreckage . " Direct hit , " he managed to say at last . Dewart nodded . " Good thing we moved the ammo . I told you a good VC mortarman can land a round on your handkerchief from the edge of the paddies . " The old Cao-Dai priest gazed for some moments at the smoking ruin , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned , and the American captain saw relief , then satisfaction appearin the old man 's eyes . There was no need for a translator . Dewart placed his palms together and bowed solemnly . To Lang he said , " Tell the Cao-Dai priest that we will build him a new pagodaany place he directs , five kilometers or better from the camp . " Dewart gestured toward the blasted sandbags . " Tell him no chance of finding any bodies for funeral . Tell him "  --  he paused  --  " I 'm sorry about that . " Dewart turned from Bao and the priest , winked at me , and caught Rutt 's huge grin as the demolitions sergeant peered over the111sandbagged teamhouse . Sternly , Captain Dewart called out , " OK Rutt , police up the rest of the team , and start getting this camp cleaned up . Tomorrow we go to work finishing this fort . I want a damned roof over our heads by tomorrow night . " " Yes , sir . One tin roof coming up , sir ! " TWO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks after General Nguyen Khanh took over direction of the South Vietnam government from " Big " Minh  --  a change American advisers welcomed as one for the better . Brandy 's real name was Francois , but no one called him that . Originally from Belgium , an OSS agent during World War II , Brandy found his way into the American Army in the early fifties and became a U.S. citizen . I was in Saigon with Captain Tim Pickins , now fully recovered from his wounds . Tim had commandeered a jeep and was giving me a guided tour of the town . At 11:00 in the morning we were passing a small open coffeehouse removed from the more Amer- icanized center of town when he spotted Captain Martell . Brandy was seated at a table near the sidewalk dressed in dapper sports- clothes , reading a French newspaper . Tim pulled the jeep to a halt . " Nobody knows what the hell Brandy does when he gets into town , " he said . " He just becomes one of the Saigon frogs and we never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part time for the Agency . " Pickins grinned wickedly . " Wait 'll he sees us . He hates to be seen with Americans . " " Maybe we should leave him alone . " " Better grab him while you can . You ca n't ever be sure of finding Captain Martell at Nam Luong  --  that 's his camp . He does jobs even I do n't know about . And I 'm supposed to know everything that happens at the ten A teams in my area . " Brandy turned a long angular face up at us as we entered the coffeehouse , his deep-brown , almost liquid eyes regarding us mournfully . His hair was coal black , he wore it long in defiance of Army convention , and he looked incredibly young . " Good morning , Brandy , " Pickins said cheerfully . Martell nodded but said nothing in return . " All right if we sit down ? I want to introduce someone who 's been wanting to meet you . " 113Brandy regarded me a moment with what must be a permanently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called over an old Vietnamese waiter . " Garcon ? L'addition s'il vous plait . " The waiter handed Brandy a check . He put down a few piastres and stood up . " Et maintenant , messieurs , si vous voulez , nous parlerons chez moi . " We followed Brandy out of the restaurant . " At that place , " Brandy said in his rolling French accent , " they know me only as Robair , a French planter from Tay Ninh . They do not know that I even speak English . It is a very useful place . But they will wonder that I was talking to Americans . " Pickins chuckled . " Sorry if we blew your cover . " Brandy shrugged expressively , long lines accenting his long thin face . Then he turned to me and apologized for his rudeness . " Nothing to forgive , " I said . " But I 'd sure like to hear about what you are doing over here . " " Eh bien , I am meeting my medical specialist and intelligence sergeant for lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " With a wave , Pickins was off , and Brandy and I walked the two blocks to the restaurant , where we found Sergeant Ossidian , the dark , heavy-featured intelligence specialist , and Sergeant Targar , the medic . Targar had a pronounced but pleasant accent , and he told me he had been born in Hungary but left in 1952 and joined the U.S. Army . His somewhat Oriental appearance I attributed to centuries of invasions and population movements in the Balkans . The luncheon was lively and informative , and when it was over Captain Martell gave his men nearly a carte blanche to tell me about the team 's mission . This they did over cool drinks at Caprice 's , a favorite Special Forces hangout , where the girls were good to look at  --  and even touch if we felt so inclined . The two biggest problems at Nam Luong , I learned , were recruitingstrike-force troopers and good intelligence agents . Both problems had been handled with typical Special Forces ingenuity . The sergeants took obvious relish in recounting how their captainhad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From a previous mission , Martell was personally acquainted with the chief of police in Saigon under President Diem. 114Brandy knew what the Saigon jail was like , and he hit upon the idea of bailing out the juvenile delinquents , and giving them a chance to join his strike force and fight the Communists rather than rot in the ancient , festering prison cells . It took presidential approvalbut finally Martell acquired about 100 assorted thieves , rapists , muggers , dope pushers , pimps , homosexuals , and murderers . These last were released to Nam Luong because they had only murdered other delinquents , not useful citizens . The chief of police promised the young hoods jail for life if they deserted Nam Luong , and in front of them gave Captain Martell and his then LLDB counterpart permission to shoot any of the jailbirdsthat gave trouble . The company of Saigon irregulars proved to be a hard-fighting group , though given to various types of body mutilation after a battle . So terrified were they of a life in prison that unlike the other companies in the camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of President Diem , his successor , " Big " Minh , currying popular favor , decreed a general amnesty and threw Diem 's chief of police into jail . Most of the strike-force companyof Saigon criminals deserted forthwith . Only a few stayed , converted by the reform efforts of the Americans . But now with Viet Cong activity on the upswing around Nam Luong , and the aggressive General Khanh recently come to power , one of Captain Martell 's missions on this trip was to replenish his strike force of hoods . Ossidian and Targar had the utmost confidencethat " the old man " would somehow turn the trick . Recruiting new agents was more of a problem , however , especiallysince Nam Luong was situated in a province of constantly increasingVC domination  --  indeed , it was believed to contain the headquarters of the Viet Cong command staff . Until two weeks ago Ossidian had a prize agent , one Tang , a lieutenant in the Viet Cong stationed near the province capital , which was only five miles from the Special Forces camp . Welleducated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Chinese . As a Buddhist , he had been unable to reach the level of advancement he felt due him in the Diem Roman Catholic administration . The Viet Cong , or as they preferred to be known , " The115National Liberation Front , " spotted the low-level dissident governmentemployee and recruited him . Tang was not a bloodthirsty type , however , and he had been revoltedat the VC terrorist tactics in which he had participated . The day he found himself dragging pregnant women into the town square where their stomachs were slit open and the foetuses pulled out , his sensibilities were so outraged he knew he could no longer be part of the Communist organization . One of Ossidian 's agents who came and went freely through the Viet Cong camps reported Tang 's discontent and a meeting betweenOssidian and Tang was arranged in a safe house in the provincecapital . Tang soon began accumulating wealth . His information was so good that the LLDB camp commander at Nam Luong persuadedhis B-team commander to request , to insist in fact , that CaptainMartell divulge to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a new B-team superior , MajorFanshaw , in the country for one week , took a chopper into Nam Luong to see personally that full disclosure of all intelligence sources was made to Captain Cam , Martell 's counterpart . Ossidian grunted in disgust . " It takes a good B-team commander a couple of months , sometimes more , sometimes never , to learn when not to go strictly by State and Defense Department policy . " Two weeks after Cam 's face to face meeting with Tang , Ossidian , carrying an envelope heavy with piastres , had gone to meet his prize agent . At the safe house the intelligence sergeant found Tang , horribly tortured to death , propped up in a chair facing the door . " Is Cam a VC sympathizer ? " I asked . " It 's worse than that . " Ossidian stared darkly at the glass of beer before him . " It 's part of this Oriental face thing . Cam had to discreditour success with Tang . So he took off for corps headquarters to boast that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all the good intelligence coming out of Nam Luong . The spy system the VC have in all the ARVN corps headquarters is so good they zapped Tang even before Cam could get back to camp . " " What are you doing for replacement agents ? " " That is a good question , " Ossidian replied , winking at Targar. 116 " The old man said to tell him whatever he wanted to know , " Targarsaid . " It 's a good story . " He gestured toward his teammate . " Take it from me , Ossidian here is the dirtiest-thinking sonofabitch I 've ever known in my life . I would n't talk to him back home on Okinawa , but here in Vietnam give me this sneaky Syrian on my team every time . " " I 've been in intelligence ten years , advising in five different countries , " Ossidian said , confirming the left-handed compliment . Together Ossidian and Targar told me how they had recruited their present star agent . Ossidian had always wanted a pretty female agent to spy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only one way to get a really good-looking , intelligent , dedicated female agent . You had to find a girl who hated the enemy with all her soul . She must desperately want revenge . How do you find such a girl ? Ossidian figured it out . Hardly a week went by that the VC did n't hit a government hamlet . These were villages built by the Saigon government and housed people who had been moved from Viet Cong threatened areas . They were protected by an armed civilian militia with ARVN troops near enough to help in case of a VC attack . However , the militia usually was unable to beat back night attacks , and ARVN troops would n't come out after dark . The first thing the VC did after such an attack was make an example of the village chief , his wife , and children if any . Ossidian persuaded Captain Martell to request a helicopter to be available for one week on a few moments ' notice . He kept the radio man on the alert twenty-four hours a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was waiting for came . The VC had overrunan important government hamlet twenty-five miles to the north during the night . Ossidian , Targar , and Captain Martell called for their chopper and were actually landing in the hamlet as the last of the Viet Cong guerrillas were running from the fast-approaching government troops . There was the usual weeping by new widows and as Targar , with his medical kit , started to do the best he could for the wounded lying on the ground , Ossidian , his camera at the ready , strode into the town square . The grisly sight he had expected was there before him . Shocked117and wailing townspeople were standing around , numbed at the horrorthey had been forced to witness . Even Ossidian , hardened as he was , confessed to a touch of nausea as he went about the business of taking photographs of the hamlet chief and his young son , perhaps twelve years old . Both had been tied up by the thumbs and disemboweled . He took portrait shots of the old man 's face turned to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep lines of agony still set . The youngster 's gaping body was a tragic sight , head back , mouth open , tongue bitten through . Standing back , Ossidian snapped several shots showing the intestinesof the father and son hanging down in the dirt , flies buzzing in them . Then came a masterpiece of the grotesque . A pig , snorting unconcernedly , rooted its way across the square , and as it came to the hanging entrails of the village chief noisily began to eat them . Ossidian managed to take the picture before Martellrushed upon the pig , kicking it squealing away . The wife of the chief hung jaggedly , tied between two upright stakes . Carefully Ossidian photographed the body in which every bone had been methodically broken . Again , he carefully focused on the broken but quite recognizable face for a closeup . In his serviceable Vietnamese , Ossidian inquired politely where the home of the late village chief stood . A dazed old man led the intelligence sergeant across dirt paths to a substantial concrete-block house , painted blue and trimmed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built , 1962 , was indicated in raised numbers painted white . Probably then the hamlet chief had been a Catholic , using the Christian calendar instead of the Buddhist . Inside , Ossidian , assisted by Captain Martell , found a desk , and above it the picture of a family of three daughters and two sons , one the boy hanging in the square . He took the picture down and then went through all the papers and envelopes . An hour and a half later , as the vanguard of the ARVN battalion entered the stricken town , Ossidian had found what he was looking for , and he and Martell were urging Targar , cleaning and dressing wounds , to hurry . Back at the A team , Ossidian took a jeep and drove into town . At the photography shop he went into the darkroom with the pro-118prietor and stayed with him while the films were developed and certainshots enlarged . The pictures made the darkroom technician sick and Ossidian had to help him get the prints completed . The following morning Ossidian was on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address of the butchered hamletchief'sdaughter and several of her letters to the family written in both French and Vietnamese in his plastic briefcase . Also , of course , he had complete photographic documentation of what the Viet Cong had done to her parents . From the letters he had determined that Lin Son Binh , the daughter , was a teacher in a Catholic school for young girls being prepared to complete their education in France . Ossidian worked on the premise that the Viet Cong always had an agent watching him even in Saigon , so at Special Forces headquartershe handed a letter addressed to Co Binh ( Miss Binh ) to be delivered to her personally through a Vietnamese courier who could not be recognized by anyone , Viet Cong or government , as an agent of the Americans . The news of the attack on the hamlet had not yet been released in the Saigon newspapers . Ossidian would have to tell Co Binh of her parents ' fate . He had wanted it this way . At 4:00 in the afternoon , dressed in civilian clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had thought of asking her to meet him in a cafe , but proper Vietnamese girls did n't walk into such places alone . He walked inside the air-conditioned room and waited . He was n't sure which of the daughters in the picturewould be Co Binh . Ten minutes after he arrived , a nervouslookingVietnamese girl in a white au-dai entered the office , looking about uncertainly . Ossidian whistled softly to himself . This was a very beautiful girl , delicate and slim , with an air of hauteur that made a man want to break through and get to her . " Would n't some Viet Cong big shot like to take that , " the intelligence sergeant had thought to himself , even as he approached her , a reassuring smile on his face . " Co Binh ? " he asked politely . She looked up at Ossidian and nodded firmly . " Do you speak English ? " he asked . " Ou aimez-vous mieux que nous parlerons en frangais. " 119Co Binh smiled for the first time . " I think maybe we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illusions about his French although he could get along in the language . " Good . Will you come with me so we can talk about your family ? " When the girl hesitated Ossidian drew the family picture from his briefcase and showed it to her . Co Binh gasped , looking at the framed photograph , hand-tinted , that she knew hung in her father 's house . " You were at my father 's house ? " Ossidian nodded and thought he detected a blush on Co Binh 's face , a momentary sag in her proud carriage . " What did he tell you about me ? " she demanded defensively . Ossidian was both relieved and concerned : relieved because he suspected Co Binh had left home under some stigma , undoubtedly something to do with a man ; concerned because she might no longer love her parents enough so that their horrible deaths would cause her to become an agent against the Viet Cong . However , surely her little brother 's ghastly death would affect her violently . " If you will come with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your father and mother . " " Maybe we can talk here ? " she suggested . Ossidian shook his head . " Please come with me . It is important . " Reluctantly , Co Binh allowed herself to be led to a tiny blue Saigontaxicab and put inside . Ossidian gave the driver an address on Minh Mang in Cholon , the Chinese section of Saigon . He did not want to tell Co Binh about her parents ' death in the cab so he asked her about herself and the school where she taught French . Her father had been loyal to the Diem regime and part of his reward had been the excellent education Co Binh and her brothers and sisters had received . Co Binh replied impatiently to Ossidian 's questions . Finally , before they reached their destination , the intelligence sergeant said to Co Binh , " We are almost there . A Vietnamese doctor friend of mine will allow us to use his house to talk comfortably . Both he and his wife will be present . " The cab pulled up in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still clearly showing her reluctance , to the front door . He hoped that she would not know that Doctor Hinh was one of the120most noted abortionists in Saigon . If they were being watched , Ossidianthought wryly , there could be no doubt in anyone 's mind why the American and the hesitant , nervous Vietnamese girl were entering Doctor Hinh 's office . The doctor , who had provided Ossidian with a safe house before , greeted them and led them to his sitting room , heavy with dark furniture and gaudy Buddhist religious symbols . He talked in Vietnamesefor a few moments with Co Binh , pointed to an open door to another room where he and his wife were having tea , and then left Ossidian and Co Binh alone . " Now , " the girl demanded . " Why you bring me here ? " Ossidian gave her a look of deep sympathy and said , " I was at your father 's hamlet yesterday just after he and your mother and brother were murdered by the Viet Cong . " Co Binh let out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face . The reaction gratified Ossidian . " When did you last see your family ? " he asked . " It has been almost a year . My father was angry when I brought to the village a boy who was a Buddhist to meet him . He . . . . " Co Binh suddenly stiffened and gave Ossidian a sharp look . " Are you sure they are dead . How can I know . Why did not the government tell me ? " " They are dead , Co Binh . " " What happened to them ? " " You know what the Viet Cong do to hamlet chiefs ? " " Here in Saigon we do not feel there is really a war . I have never been hurt by the Viet Cong . They are bad because they are Communistsand hate the Church but . . . " Ossidian knew the moment for the necessary brutality had arrived . He took the long shots of Co Binh 's father , mother and young brother from his briefcase and showed them to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full impact hit her . She screamed . The wife of Doctor Hinh appeared at the door but Ossidian motioned her away . One by one , Ossidian placed the other pictures in front of Co Binh , who stared at them shocked , white-faced , shaking , and moaning softly . When Co Binh saw the picture of the pig rooting in her father 's entrails she cried out and dug her fingers into her eyes. 121 " No . No . No more . Please , " she cried . " Do you see what the Viet Cong are ? " Ossidian pursued . " Do you see what they do all over your country , every day ? " Co Binh , incapable of coherent talk , was now screaming hysterically . Ossidian put his arm on her shoulders to comfort her , but she shook it off . He stood up and motioned to Doctor Hinh who was standing just inside the sitting room . The doctor went to her , a prepared hypodermic needle in his hand , and gave the convulsing girl a sedative . Co @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next day , still in a partial state of shock , Ossidian began to talk to her of revengeand duty to Vietnam . Two weeks later , as part of their civic action program , the SpecialForces A team at Nam Luong fixed up a ramshackle old schoolbuildingin the province capital . Desks and chairs were bought , books and blackboards installed in the rooms , and the new school for refugee orphans of the province was ready by the time the new teacher from Saigon arrived . Co Binh became immediately popular with the children as well as the male adults of the town . Ossidian carefully instructed Co Binh to become friendly with Mr. Hinh , a prominent lawyer and businessman working both sides of the war . Through past agents Ossidian knew that Hinh had close contacts with the highest officers in the National Liberation Front . Hinh developed an immediate interest in Co Binh , who talked frequently about the Americans and their camp which she had been invited to visit several times . As Ossidian had foreseen , Hinh soon realized that Co Binh could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Liberation Front commanders . Hinh introduced her to Colonel Ling , the Viet Cong commanderof the whole corps area , who was an occasional visitor to the Hinh establishment in the province capital . She convinced Ling that she was against the government and the Americans meddlingin her country . Ling invited her to visit his headquarters , a permanent , comfortableseries of concrete and stone buildings in the thick jungle and scrub forest thirty miles northwest of the province capital . In spite of constant urging by the American advisers , no segment of122the Vietnamese Army had ever dared go into this hill country near the Cambodian border . Now Mr. Hinh and Colonel Ling were each trying to make Hinh 's protegee his mistress , Ossidian told me proudly . Targar shook his head . " I 'm a humane fellow , a medic . If I was n't too old to go back to college I 'd become a doctor . This man , Ossidian , sometimes I am sick with him . " Targar grinned at his teammate . Then to me he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Already he is looking for a new agent to replace Co Vinh when she is caught . " " She 's just about to be her most effective , " Ossidian explained . " Unfortunately , maximum effectiveness is usually soon followed by compromise . " " But , my friend , " Targar said , " she can not reach max performancewithout the help of the medic . " " You see , Co Binh has been playing off Mr. Hinh against Colonel Ling just a little . And , the colonel has been out in the jungle withoutanything nice like Co Binh around for one hellofa long time . His Communist nuts are mighty hot for our girl ; he wants her all to himself and told Hinh the Front would execute him if he attempted to seduce a loyal female agent . " The intelligence sergeant 's laugh was deep . " For the last week Hinh has been pleading with Co Binh to spread for Ling . Old Hinh is one scared double-agent businessman . " Ossidian 's problem now was that Co Binh 's hatred was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to use her body to bring defeat to the Communists she had a terror of a Viet Cong-fathered child growing in her body . She knew she would kill such a child at the moment of its birth , before if possible ; and this would be such a mortal sin  --  after her Catholic training  --  thatshe could never live with herself or face a priest the rest of her life . To the surprise of Ossidian and Targar , Co Binh had absolutely no knowledge of contraceptives . The intelligence sergeant , however , was as resolved as the impassioned Colonel Ling that Co Binh and the Viet Cong commander should have frequent sexual congress , the earlier the better . Thus , while Co Binh kept putting off an increasingly anxious and123more irritable Colonel Ling , Ossidian asked Captain Martell to requestthrough B-team channels that a female contraceptive kit be immediately flown into Nam Luong . The order had arrived on Major Fanshaw 's desk his first week in command . The explosion was instantly radioed back to Captain Martell , who was summoned to the B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making Fanshaw  --  carryingout his first Special Forces assignment  --  appear , even to himself , naive and inexperienced in intelligence matters . It was with enormous disinclination that Major Fanshaw took on the most distasteful chore of his career . He appealed to the chief naval surgeonin Saigon for a graduated set of contraceptive diaphragms from small to medium . He further requested the proper instrument to determine the correct-size article that should be issued . The remainder , he promised , would be returned . The day following the request , as Ossidian and undoubtedly Colonel Ling grew increasingly restive , word came back from Fanshawto Captain Martell that neither the Navy hospital nor any of its dispensaries carried such medical supplies . Martell , standing by the radio as his sergeant decoded the message , sent back in exasperation  --  " Makerequest for subject medical supplies to Central IntelligenceAgency operating group at MAAG headquarters , Saigon . Will arrive Saigon tomorrow personally to accept issue . " Targar held up a handsome , leatherette kit . " And here is subject issue . Madame Nhu really had this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poor girl can have a little fun and keep out of trou-ble . " " Suppose she 's a virgin , " I said . Ossidian shook his head . " I do n't think she is . But if so  --  Targar , you know your duty . That girl 's got to be able to use the thing im-mediately ! " The intelligence sergeant looked at his watch and then pushed his chair back . " Got to leave you for a while . I have another interviewat the office of the good Doctor Hinh  --  no relation , by the way , to Mr. Dinh . I checked that out . I 'll meet you and the old man at the Continental at 1730 hours . See you then . " Ossidian hauled his bulky though disciplined and even agile body out of the chair and headed for the door. 124 " Another schoolteacher , this time ? " I asked . " Thank God , no , " Targar replied . " This is a high-class whore whose family were killed , and her sisters raped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of civic action program . We 're starting a high-class whorehouse in the province capital . Only the highest-ranking VC will get in . " At 5:30 Targar and I found Captain Martell sitting in the back of the Continental Palace terrace bar , looking out over the busy square . " Some day the VC are going to toss a bomb in here , " I grumbled , sitting down . " Never will that happen , " Brandy assured me . " This is Frenchowned . They pay their taxes to the VC . This is the safest place in town . And nice . None of those steel-wire screens . What will you have ? " Targar and I drank beer as Brandy slowly sipped his vermouth . " Ossidian went to interview the young lady ? " Targar nodded . " Did you have any luck policing up strike-force recruits , sir ? " " Yes , " Brandy said . " I wonder if you would mind going over to the prison with me tomorrow and giving our share of delinquents a physical examination . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Saigon . " " Our share , sir ? " " Some of the other A-team captains in need of VC fodder heard of my idea . But I got first choice . You 'll see a number of our old copains , Targar . " Brandy looked up , smiling . " Ah , here comes Lieutenant Vinh . He is the LLDB XO at Nam Luong , " Brandy explained to me . " He has come in town with two of his best sergeants to personally escortour young warriors back to where their talents for mayhem and assassination can be put to work on behalf of national objectives . " Martell gestured to the empty chair and Lieutenant Vinh sat down . We were introduced . " By the way , " Martell asked me , " how about coming back to Nam Luong with us ? " " You could n't keep me away . " " Good . We 'll go out on the MAAG milk run tomorrow afternoon . Vinh will put our new contingent of hoods on a special morningflight as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you want me to check , sir ? " " No leprosy , no chancres . I do n't want any blood-spitters . If they have the clap , and I assume most of them will , we can stick them full of penicillin when they get to Nam Luong . " Brandy grinned at me . " The first time I came to Vietnam the Army had only two physical tests . A man must not uncontrollably spit blood when he talked . Then they had a ring about five inches in diameter for the pinhead test . If the top of the recruit 's head protrudedthrough the ring he was , quite rightly , judged a cretin . He did n't have to serve . My first advice was to make the ring a bit larger . Too many troopers who could only drool and make monkeychatterwere passing the physical . Of course "  --  Brandy gave a Gallic shrug  --  " most of them were shot for insubordination . " Captain Martell turned to Lieutenant Vinh . " May I buy you a drink ? " 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perforated-steel strip runway , and Martell , Ossidian , Targar , and I disembarked . A jeep pulled up to meet us , driven by a tall , open-faced , smilingfirst lieutenant , green beret low on his forehead . I was introduced to Bob Barton , Captain Martell 's XO , and we piled into the jeep . It was about 1:00 in the afternoon when we arrived , and the drive to Nam Luong took another twenty minutes . Barton drove full tilt down the road and I held on tightly to my treasured jungle campaign hat . Brandy laughed . " Too fast ? We make it as hard as possible for the odd sniper to get one of us . " Finally Barton turned off the once-paved main road , now fast disintegratingto gravel , and took a right up to the outer barbed-wire perimeter around Nam Luong . Outside the perimeter were rows of wooden shacks . " We 've got about two hundred and fifty women and children dependentsof the strike force living there , " Brandy said . Two tiger-suited strikers saluted and let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bamboo-spiked mud and126stone walls . Again two guards saluted and let us past the corner machine-gun bunker . Behind us a barbed-wire barricade was slid back into place . " Nice permanent cement-type buildings you have here , " I remarked . " Used to be a French fort . The Viet Minh took it for a while and then the French captured it again and really fixed it up . " The jeep stopped under a tree in the center of an L formed by two cement longhouses . " Ahead of us is the American chow hall , the kitchen , and further down the operations and supply room . " Brandy pointed at a long low building with a series of doors along it . " There 's where we sack out . Bring your gear . There 's an extra cot in my room . " Brandy 's accent was particularly noticeable when he used American slang . After depositing my pack in the captain 's quarters I was introduced to the other members of the team  --  all but two sergeants who were out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , " Brandy suggested . " Then , you will see everything . " Barton and Ed Swiggert , the team sergeant , sat down with us . A Chinese girl came in with a pan of hot rice . " Ah , yes , there she is . Sweet Lips . " Brandy called out , " Sweet Lips , you do n't let any of these boys be naughty with you when I go away ? " Sweet Lips giggled and filled our bowls . Brandy turned to his XO . " Bob , I think we will see problems with this new bunch of criminals . They all arrived with Lieutenant Vinh ? " " Oh , yes . They 're here , every one you bailed out of jail this morning is accounted for . What 's the trouble besides we all have to get new pickproof locks on our doors ? " " We must keep them fighting all the time , always on operations , like before . Only now we have Captain Cam who tries to cut down on combat operations . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He does n't like our hoods . " " He is n't the only one , sir , " said Master Sergeant Swiggert . " He does n't even like them being here , " Martell added . " He is planning a big inspection this week . We must try to shape them up . Maybe we take the best of this new group , make an honor guard , give them special colored scarf or something . Give them little extra127privileges . Then the others try to be better soldiers so they can be honor guard . " " Right , sir , " said Barton . " Good . Now , while Swiggert and I go over some things maybe you will show our guest here around the camp . " I followed Barton out into the hot sun and he began pointing out the various facilities of the camp . Near the strike-force barracks on the opposite side of the parade ground from the American quarters was a large , shrieking and laughing crowd of strikers . " What gives ? " I asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Barton 's wide , ruddy-complexioned face . " The strikers get a big jolt out of the monkeys . " Seeing I was interested , he walked me in the direction of the noisy throng . " The boys have a funny sense of humor . Looks like some of the returnees from the Saigon jail checking up to see if their old monkey friends are still around . " As we strolled toward the monkey cage Barton told me about the camp 's most popular pet , a gibbon . " We started out with a male and a female in the cage together . Trouble was the female was frigid . Our male turned out to be an oversexed little bastard . He had a miserabletime . The goddamned female would bite him every time he came after her . " Barton laughed . " Well , one of our hoods felt sorry for the poor sonofabitch and tossed a hen in with him . " " A hen ? " Barton laughed . " Come on . " He shoved his way through the crowd around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In front of the cage there was a mean-faced little Viet holding a clucking hen just outside the gibbon 's reach . Both hairy arms were thrust through the chicken wire , bright eyes fixed on the nervous fowl . The striker would let the gibbon almost get to the hen and then pull it an inch out of the little beast 's reach . Each time this happened the gibbon screamed in shrill frustration , ran around the cage several times , and banged his head . This was the signal to put the hen close to him again and the gibbon immediately made another lunge through the cage . The screams of laughter from the strikers drowned out the siren-like shrieks of the gibbon . Seeing that the American officer and another American were present , the striker in charge of the entertainment decided to get128down to the main attraction . The laughter and what could only be Vietnamese obscenities reached a crescendo as the door to the cage was opened a crack and the hen thrown inside . The lusty cheers that went up as the gibbon chased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , reminded me of the first appearance of the bull in a corrida . In a businesslike , down-to-earth manner the gibbon turned the hen upside down and began to pluck out the screeching fowl 's tail feathers . Expertly he divested the hen of every feather about its tail and then ignoring the furious protestations , assaulted the rear of the squawking biddy . That such a noise could come out of a small bird rocked me . Even the strikers , fighting each other for a better view of the proceedings and crying out encouragements to the camp mascot , could n't drown out the reedy shrieks . The gibbon was soon surfeited and threw the now limp and wounded hen aside , where it lay , flapping its wings . The show was over and the still noisy strikers began to disperse . " Quite a matinee , " I remarked . " When they really want a spectacle they throw in a rooster . " Barton chuckled grimly . " Oh yes , we do have a ball with our allies around here . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Targar , who said Captain Martell suggested they take me downtownand show me their civic action project  --  the school . " Watch out for these two , " Barton warned with a grin . " They 'll sure as hell get you in trouble . " Ossidian got behind the wheel of the jeep ; Targar and two boxes of medical equipment took up the back . " It 's sick call at the school today , " Targar explained as the green-bereted sergeant drove off at a frightening pace . In town he wove through a tangle of streets and finally pulled up in a pleasant , grassy yard with a brightly painted jungle gym , slides and swings . " School , " Ossidian announced . A crowd of children surged out of the door of the freshly painted structure . They called out happily and surrounded the two sergeantsas they stepped from the jeep . Recognizing me as an American , some of the kids grabbed me too . Co Binh , wearing a white au-dai , emerged into the sunlight . Her129pique at the children for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more appealing . " Ah , hello , Co Binh , " Targar called to her cheerfully . " Your gynecologistis here ! " Although his words obviously meant nothing to her , Co Binh blushed prettily . She had been expecting Targar for two days . Ossidian nudged me . " What do you think of this place ? Killing two birds with one stone . Civic action at its best and intelligence at its most effective . The taxpayers ought to be happy  --  two deals for the price of one . " Ossidian and Targar met each other 's eyes for a moment . " Oh , shit , " Ossidian muttered . " What are you going to do ? We 're over here to win , are n't we ? " Targar , a medical kit slung over his shoulder , went over to Co Binh , said something , and then they walked toward the back of the school . " Funny thing about old Victor Charlie , " Ossidian mused . " He thinks Americans are dickheads for coming over here and trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only time he respects us is when we 're killing him . " The intelligence sergeant took a handful of candy from his pocket and started distributing it to the children . " You 'd think it would be compromising Co Binh for all of us to be around the school this way  --  Targar going back there alone with her . But hell no . When we get on this do-good kick Victor Charlie just thinks we 're nuts and laughs . It 's funny to them . We finance a school and pay one of their agents because we want everyone to love us . " About fifteen minutes later Targar rejoined us out in the yard . He started getting the kids lined up for medical inspection . " How 'd it go ? " Ossidian asked . " No sweat . I 've found my niche in life at last . I have just the right bedside manner to be a hellofa specialist in intimate female problems . That 's where the money in medicine is , you know . Got her measured up , gave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without Colonel Ling being any the wiser . And I do not embarrass her at all . She thinks I am great . I think she is falling in love with her gynecologist . " Targar grabbed a little boy by the arm . One eye was almost closed130and full of pus . " My God . What is this ? I got to get sick call going . Ossidian , she wants to see you  --  got big things to tell you . Now I got to take care of my kids . " Targar looked up at me . " If you like to help . . . ? " " Just tell me what to do . " For almost two hours Targar examined and treated the children 's ills . He muttered in various of the languages he spoke as he worked . In English he asked aloud several times , " What are all you kids goingto do when you lose Co Binh ? " Finally he was finished , and I helped him gather up his medical equipment and store it away in the olive-drab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We all said good-bye to Co Binh , Targar had a few sotto voce last words of advice for her , and again we took to the jeep . " Let 's go to MAAG headquarters , " Ossidian said to Targar who was driving . " Captain Martell wants us to meet him there . " We drove into the tree-shaded grounds of a large stucco house . There were several Army vehicles in the driveway . Targar found a patch of shade and parked . Several pleasant American officers and sergeants in the main lounge of MAAG headquarters offered us cans of cold beer , and we took them to a garden table out under a tree to wait for Martell . " What did you find out ? " Targar asked . Ossidian stared at the blue sky thoughtfully . Finally he said , " I got the most frustrating job on the team . What good does it do to recruit agents and get them killed when you ca n't get action at the top on the intelligence you collect ? " Before Targar could answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at us to follow him inside . We hastily swallowed our beers . Brandy herded us into the MAAG intelligence office where I was introduced to Captain Percy . " OK , Ossidian , let 's give Captain Percy and MAAG the benefit of any intelligence you may have acquiredtoday . " " Yes , sir , " said Ossidian . Captain Percy , intense and young-looking , swung his swivel chair toward the map to which Ossidian had addressed himself . The intelligence sergeant indicated a point about two miles from131the Cambodian border . " You know this place , sir ? " he asked Percy . " Certainly . There are five model hamlets there . We trained the Civil Defense people there . USOM has spent over $150,000 on those hamlets to improve the economy . They have a large pig programgoing and agricultural experts have spent a couple of months helping those people learn new ways of fertilizing their fields . " " In other words , sir , " Ossidian said , " those five hamlets , with a combined population of about 3,000 people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate along the Cambodian border . " " We 're all proud of our work out there , Sergeant . I suppose you are going to tell me that the Viet Cong plan to attack one or more of those hamlets ? " " Tonight , sir . They have the largest of the five already infiltrated . The doors will be open and the VC will walk in bloodlessly . They 'll kill the hamlet chief , the security chief , and the information chief . Then they will occupy the other four hamlets with no sweat because they already have the strongest one . " " There is an ARVN battalion stationed only ten miles from those hamlets , " Captain Percy said . " We 'll get word to the commander and our adviser with that battalion , Captain Canham . He 's a good , conscientious man . If that battalion will move right now , they should be able to save those hamlets . " " They wo n't move , " Ossidian said resignedly . " You , I , and the VC know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can try , " Percy argued . " We 're beginning to establish good working relations now between advisers and Vietnamese commanders . " I 'm glad to hear that , sir "  --  Ossidian 's tone was heavy with irony  --  " because there 's a lot more to this than another hamlet attack . The Communists are going to challenge ARVN and Saigon to get them out in less than forty-eight hours . Then very solicitously they are going to tell all the people to get down into the holes they 've dug in the floors of their houses . And then they 're going to wait for a typical Vietnamese Army attack . They know there is n't a battalion commander in the ARVN that would take a chance on getting himselfor his officers shot . They know the Viets will call in artillery , American 105 's with American advisers . They know the Viets will call in air strikes , flown by American pilots because the Viet pilots132prefer not to fly low enough to do any good . When the artillery and air strikes really get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip out of these hamlets and run across to Cambodia . " Ossidian'sblack eyes burned . " So what 's the net result ? All the work USOM and MAAG have done to build up those villages will be destroyed because the Viet battalion commanders wo n't fight like men and push the VC out of the village in man-to-man fighting . What do we do ? We turn five hamlets of loyal peasants into VC sympathizers overnight . The VC wo n't be killing them and their cattle and destroying their houses  --  it will be the Americans . " Ossidian rapped the map with his knuckles and stepped away . " And that 's straight from a reliable agent . " " Thank you , Sergeant . As usual your information is timely . " Martell had been listening soberly to Ossidian 's briefing . " What are you going to do about it , Captain Percy ? " " I am on my way to discuss it right now with our senior sector adviser and the Vietnamese division commander . " Martell stood up . " If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , we can send in our medical team when the attack is over . " That night at Nam Luong the Americans showed an epic western for the Vietnamese strike force , projecting it against the side of a whitewashed building . It was a Cinemascope production , but the camp 's 16-mm. movie projector was not equipped with a Cinemascopelens so the cowboys , Indians and horses all were long and thin . However , the strikers loved the action and identified themselves with it . When the Indians appeared the strikers screamed " VC , " and when the soldiers or cowboys came to the rescue the Nam Luong irregulars vied with each other in shouting out the number of their own strike-force companies . We were sitting around the operations room after the movie when the radio started to sputter dots and dashes . The communications sergeant wrote furiously on his pad and then turned to Martell . " Sir , the VC have occupied those hamlets already . They say they will stay for forty-eight hours . " Two mornings later I went into the hamlets with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predicted had come true . Piteously wounded and burned children were dying ev-133erywhere , men , women and cattle lay dead , the stench abominable . The ARVN battalion , which occupied the hamlets after the VC had fled the Vietnamese-ordered American bombings and **25;6721;TOOLONG barrages , suffered not a single casualty . CaptainCanham had vainly tried to persuade the Vietnamese battalion commander to attack the VC on the hamlet walls in hand-to-hand combat ; he was devastated with frustration . Just before dark a chopper evacuated the Nam Luong medical team from the hamlet . Back at camp we learned that the next day Major Fanshaw would be in to inspect the camp . Promptly at 10:00 Saturday morning an HU21b , the executivetypechopper , settled down on its runners just outside Nam Luong . Twenty of the Saigon delinquents made up the honor guard dressed in starched tiger pattern fatigues , yellow scarfs around necks and red bands around their cloth fatigue caps . They held their big Ml Garand rifles at attention as the major walked between the facing ranks . Fanshaw , his Vietnamese counterpart , Major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , walked together . The American major eyed the honor guard with approval and complimentedMartell on the military discipline in his strike force . As Fanshaw proceeded with the inspection , I tagged along at a discreet distance . He looked into every one of the rooms in the cementbarracks building occupied by the Americans . Recently an order had come down from higher headquarters that Special Forces men would not post any pinup girls  --  since such displays might be offensive to our allies , the gibbon-taunting Vietnamese strikers ! Various aspects of the camp did distress Fanshaw  --  its smell of undrained sewage , for one thing . After the inspection he took his A team into their operations room and was closeted with them for an hour . Then he called in Major Xuan and Captain Cam for anotherhalf-hour conference . Shortly after noon , declining to stay for lunch , Fanshaw walked out of the camp to reboard his chopper . He brightened at the double row of honor guard waiting to see him off . Walking between the immaculate , crisply uniformed Saigon delinquents , Fanshaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand . Then he and Major Xuan boarded their helicopter and were soon on their way back to the B team. 134Captain Martell immediately ordered another meeting of his A team in the operations room . I was invited to sit in on this one . The atmosphere of disgruntlement was apparent . Major Fanshaw had found much to criticize , Brandy said . The fact that the Americans could only advise and cajole their counterpartsinto keeping Nam Luong clean and keeping up sanitary maintenancehad made small impression on their commander . He was particularly irked at a long list of complaints the Vietnamese camp commander , Captain Cam , had sent up to Major Xuan at the B team . Foremost on the list was rudeness on the part of the Americanstoward their LLDB counterparts . The radio sergeant shifted his attention to his receiver as a call started to come in on voice . He put on his earphones so Captain Martell would not be disturbed . " Sir ! " The commo sergeant 's voice suddenly interrupted . " The pilot of Major Fanshaw 's helicopter just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing off his right hand . He thinks one of the honor guard milked it off him when he was shaking hands . " " Sergeant Swiggert , " Brandy 's voice cut through the silence in the room . " Every man in the honor guard will stand a shakedown inspection  --  with Captain Cam 's approval . Since I know we wo n't find anything , they will be assigned to the point squad on tomorrownight'soperation . " Loud , appreciative laughter broke out . Brandy let the chortling continue until the atmosphere of depression was dispelled . " OK men ! " Brandy held up a hand . " Let 's get this briefing finished . We 're short . Less than a month to go before we leave Vietnam . I want to see us go out of here as heroes , an A detachment that will be remembered . Lieutenant Barton and Sergeant Swiggert have volunteered to deliberately walk into a VC ambush . I want every man in this detachment to get with the program . Let 's end up big ! " Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence operations and then Sergeant Swiggert will tell you about tomorrownight'spatrol . Go ahead , Ossidian . You got the limelight . " A few goodnaturedly uncomplimentary noises met Ossidian as he took his place in front of the map of the surrounding terrain . " First , you all know about our civic action project , the school135for orphans . You 've all seen Co Binh and I guess you know she 's working for us in more ways than one . Well , on Wednesday Dr. Targar , the famous Hungarian pussy specialist "  --  Ossidian bowed to the medic amid raucous laughter  --  " made it possible for Co Binh to , shall we say , step up her relationship with Colonel Ling . Ling is a full colonel in both the Aiuiy of North Vietnam and the NationalLiberation Front here in South Vietnam . " Ossidian turned to the map and pointed to a hilly , jungle region close to the Cambodian border . " This is where Colonel Ling has his headquarters , about forty miles from the province capital . ARVN has never had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French never tried to hit it when it was a Viet Minh stronghold . " Colonel Ling is the commander of all Viet Cong operations in this corps area . In other words , he coordinates all Communist guerrillafighting for one quarter of South Vietnam . If we could capture him it would be one of the most important victories of the war . " Ossidian let his words have an effect . " Let me give you a little more background , " he continued . " On Wednesday night , after Doctor Targar performed his invaluable services , our friend Mr. Hinh drove Co Binh out to visit Colonel Ling at his headquarters . " Ossidian flashed a lewd grin . " Talking to Co Binh this morning I found out that Ling has something in common with most of us studs in this room . He does n't like a short time . When he has a woman he wants her for all night . Co Binh got out to Ling 's headquarters in Mr. Hinh 's car about 10:00 at night . After a nice , intimatetalk she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But she made Hinh wait and drive her home . " The intelligence sergeant chuckled sardonically . " I guess Ling was still as horny as a bag of toads when Co Binh said good-bye , but she told him the Americans would be suspicious if she was n't at school first thing in the morning . Then our girl told Ling that she would have some special information for him next time she saw him . This was when he told her about hitting those five hamlets . " " Well , " said Ossidian , " it 's toujours l'amour , tonight for sure for Colonel Ling . Co Binh is going out there . But  --  like last time  --  old Ling is only going to get a short time . Maybe let just a couple more toads out of the bag , is all . Co Binh runs a Sunday school and the136Americans will be over . She ca n't compromise her usefulness by not getting back . " Tonight she will show Ling how useful she can be to him . She 's heard us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sundaynight and just before dawn they are going to cross some river and attack a town called Phu Nhu . " Ossidian went to the map , pointed out a river that ran from west to east about twelve miles north of Nam Luong , and then to a spot on the map about a mile north of the river . " We know , and the VC know we know that they are building up an arms cache here . We 've been wanting to hit it for three months , but the camp commanderrefuses to cross the river  --  too many VC , he says . We say yes , many VC , that 's why we want to attack there . " The reason Co Binh knows this is our plan , she tells Ling , is because we were all bad-mouthing our counterparts for being cowardsand betting with each other that they wo n't cross the river this time either . She heard us say we 're only taking one platoon because that 's all we need for a surprise attack at dawn and any more would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth in front of us a few moments . " Before she leaves with Hinh tonight Co Binh is going to tell Ling that she hates a short time too . She is going to suggest that he come into town , stay at Mr. Hinh 's house like he did the night they met , and then they can have all night together . " Ossidian stopped his pacing . " Here 's where Ling may get just the tiniest bit suspicious . He 'll probably wait and see if the Phu Nhu operation comes off . If it does and his VC hit us and inflict casualtieshe 'll be feeling pretty good about Co Binh . Probably Tuesday or Wednesday night his Democratic Republic of Vietnam gonads will be in a mighty big uproar for more of Co Binh . Since he now knows she 's a tried and true American-hating VC he 'll come into town . And then "  --  Ossidian grinned at his audience  --  " somehow we 'll snatch him . " Ossidian sat down and Captain Martell stood up in front of his detachment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefing . I find it impossible to follow the act . So , I turn the briefing over to Sergeant Swiggert who will outline our plans for tomorrow night 's operation . " 1373 . Three Americans went out with the first platoon of Delta ( for delinquent ) Company of the Nam Luong strike force . The patrol , clad in tiger suits , slipped from the security of the camp and moved out into the moonlight . Lieutenant Barton 's twisted grin would have worried Lieutenant Vinh had he looked back . Sergeant Ritchie , the medic , also wore a knowing smile ; it was hard for him not to laugh aloud . I was the third American on the patrol . Brandy had objected strenuously to letting me go on a patrol whose mission was to walk into an ambush . But finally he agreed to let me accompany the secondplatoon . This one , led by an LLDB sergeant and advised by Master Sergeant Swiggert , would leave Nam Luong twenty minutes after the first platoon . Swiggert 's mission was to provide cover when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of the strikers or the LLDB team knew about the ambush . I held out for the first Platoon and when we walked out of Nam Luong 's gate Brandy wrung my hand as though he would never see me again . One hour out of camp Lieutenant Vinh halted the platoon to rest the young hoods in his charge . Sergeant Hanh , known as Ho Chi Hanh to the Americans , walked up and down the file during the break , slapping a striker silently on the shoulder or chucking one under the chin . Hanh was a soldier in anyone 's language and army , having fought the French for four years with the Viet Minh . But he was a lover of freedom and free enterprise and turned against the Communists after the French left Vietnam . The men loved Sergeant Hanh , who took them to the local whorehouse and let them take pictures of him hacking . Hanh kept a supply of pictures of himself in action with the two overworked prostitutes in town known as " Dracula " and " Witch Hazel " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were marching again on our course toward Phu Nhu . The strikers carrying BAR 's were dwarfed by the heavy automatic rifles they proudly bore over their shoulders . The big BAR 's were awarded to the most reliable strikers . The honor guard from Saturday 's inspection were up front of the 50-man platoon. 138The planning of our cover platoon , twenty minutes behind us , had made for an interesting discussion between Captain Martell , Lieutenant Barton , Swiggert , and Ossidian . Barton , with the first platoon , had requested that the second platoon be equipped with 60-mm. mortars . He knew what it was like to get hit by an ambush and he wanted something behind him that would quickly disperse it . Swiggert was in agreement . But Ossidian had vetoed the idea . It would make it look as though we were expecting something to have not only a cover platoon but one equipped with mortars . Better for the overall plan for the first platoon to fight its way out as best it could . Martell , reluctantly , sided with Ossidian  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second break Barton sat down beside me , fanning his face with his tattered lucky campaign hat . " Couple more hours and we 'll be in the middle of them , " he said in low tones . " Better drop fast , right in the trail when you hear it coming in . " " I know what to do , old man , " I replied . In an ambush both sides of the trail would be mined , or at least planted with pungi stakes , which give agonizing death to anyone falling on them . The rest period over , we started off again across the rice paddies , dry in this season of the year . The constant grinding and rattling of the wood cutters ' oxcarts crawling back to town from the thick scrub forests indicated we were still paralleling the main road . Half an hour later the clatter of oxcarts became more distant and finally faded completely . Now we were heading directly at the North Star hanging low on the horizon . We stalked along the edges of the rice paddies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods . Suddenly I saw dark forms ahead dart out of the patrol formation and become clearly silhouetted in the open field . They bent over , picked objects up and scurried back into the line of march . Barton cursed under his breath . " You ca n't teach them , " he snapped . " We go through a watermelonpatch and they have to load up . If the VC are watching they 'll know just where we are . " My carbine , sixty rounds belted to the folding stock and two bananaclips taped butt to butt in the lock , began to be awkward to139carry . Technically , I was a noncombatant , but the VC did n't know this , so the weapon was ready for instant employment . Perhaps the strikers sensed approaching danger for they began observing excellent noise discipline , picking up their feet and placingthem down softly . In alarm , I felt the tickling in my throat of a persistent cough which had latched onto me some months ago in a cold spell just before I left New York . New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the cough would n't quit . A slight croak tore lose from my throat . InstantlyBarton 's cautioning hand was on my shoulder . I reached swiftly into the pocket of my loose jungle fatigues for the bottle of GI gin . A good slug of this 80 proof terpin hydrate elixir guaranteesan hour free of coughing . As we pushed on through the night , Barton glanced frequently at the luminous dial of his watch . Daylight was not far off , and neither , I judged , was the enemy , when the patrol halted . I followed Barton forward . Through the trees ahead the river shimmered in the bright starlight . The moon had set . I watched as Barton and Lieutenant Vinh talked in inaudible whispers . Finally , Barton turned to me . " Lieutenant Vinh came up with a new one . He says we ca n't cross the river because there are too many alligators in it . " Barton grinned . " This is the time I would have to make an excuse for not crossing . I 'm glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going up as far as the river and wait for daylight . Vinh says , Maybe we go back to Nam Luang when daylight comes . ' " From the trees we watched as 20 strikers , led by Sergeant Hanh , made their way to the river 's edge . The white , flat light of dawn was beginning to erase the stars and seep into the scrub forest . Sergeant Ritchie and Barton , their carbines ready , peered through the tangledgrowth in all directions . Suddenly , from the other side of the river , shattering bursts of automatic-weapons fire ploughed into the point section . Hanh dropped to the ground , shouting orders , and the strikers began crawling back to rejoin the platoon . Before the rest of the platoon could put up a heavy volume of fire to cover the retreating strikers , we were hit from our left flank . I threw myself to the trail and fired bursts from my carbine . Barton ,
