txt Another Western state , one of the last . stand survivors , may be about to cave in to the inevitable ? a general sales tax . Oregon is one of only half a dozen states in the nation that have n't fallen to it already . Three of the holdouts are in the West . ( Alaska and Montana are the two others . ) Now a phalanx of key Oregonians , generaled by Republican Gov . Tom McCall , is pushing the tax . And as they puff and prod , they dangle a carrot before the electorate , which must pass on it . The carrot : property-tax relief and more state aid to local schools . The state pays only 23 percent of local school costs . If the sales tax passes , the state says it would pick up 50 percent of the school tab and pare property taxes by more than $100 million a year . - - . Oregonians ordinarily reject new taxes . But this time the carrot may be too big to resist . With . California Lt. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nixon Cabinet , all political eyes are on the lookout for his successor . Anyone Gov . Ronald Reagan picks to fill the seat Mr. Finch vacates would promptly rise to statewide political prominence . Three Republicans are high in the running : state Finance Director Caspar Weinberger , state Sen. George Deukmejian , and state Transportation Director Gordon C. Luce . Politically Mr. Weinberger would be a strong choice . He is a moderate , a northerner , and popular . Some Republicans think he would make a good running mate for the conservative Mr. Reagan in 1970 . Senator Deukmejian , a man of respected political talents , has a good chance . But to name him might mean losing a razor-slim Republican edge in the state Senate . Some think that if Mr. Reagan picks the man he really wants , it will be his friend , fellow conservative , and Cabinet member Luce . The farmer and the cowman may now be friends . But out West neither one likes the government much these days . The Agriculture and Interior Departments are about to hike grazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been so stirred up since the days of the big range wars . Washington intends to hike grazing fees on Bureau of Land Management land by 375 percent over the next 10 years . And it aims to raise forest fees 250 percent . Just next year the fee for ant adult cow on public land would jump from 33 to 44 cents a month . The adult cow may not care much , but the stockmen do . They are caught in a cost-price squeeze , as it is . Costs are steadily rising , but cattle do n't bring much more now than they did 20 years ago . So the National Cattlemen 's Association is predicting a wave of bankruptcies at home on the range if the hikes go through . Trends .. . Indians around the West are on the wampum warpath . They intend to scalp a few dollars in new ways . The Quechan Indians , just across the Colorado from Yuma , Ariz. , are about to open a trailer park and a shopping complex . Besides bringing a profit to the tribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such things are happening on reservations throughout the Southwest . The White Mountain Apaches are building a $2 million sports resort , complete with ski lift and lodge . The San Carlos Apaches are about to build a tourist center near Globe , Ariz. , where they will do Indian dances and other authentic things for paleface tourists . The Pimas near Chandler , Ariz. , have a box factory and a broiler chicken production unit in the works . And Indians of 16 other tribes are getting together on a 1.55-acre copper smelter site at Clarkdale , Ariz . Snowmobiles arc the biggest thing going in the West since the Conestoga wagon . They 're opening up just about as much new territory , too  --  places few people ever saw in winter before . Wyoming 's Yellowstone National Park , the essence of inaccessibility in winters past , has lost its snowbound privacy to the buzz of the snowmobile engine . Now visitors can watch Old Faithful erupt on schedule in the dead of winter . And Montana dude ranches are putting tenderfeet in snowmobiles  --  instead of saddles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to keep hibernating grizzlies awake all winter .
