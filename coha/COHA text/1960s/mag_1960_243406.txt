When President Eisenhower submitted his record $41 billion defense budget to the Congress last January , he set his military jaw and let it be known that he would authorize no more spending than that for defense . That resolution lasted until last week . <P> <P> Events abroad helped change his mind : the capture of U-2 Pilot Gary Powers , the summit blowup and , since then , the increasing Soviet truculence . But so did election-year political pressures at home : if there was one thing all candidates and platforms agreed upon , it was the need to spend more on defense . Eisenhower gave in . <P> The new plans-first sketched out in Ike 's message to Congress and detailed later on by Defense Secretary Thomas Gates-called for spending about $476 million more , $150 million of it in fiscal 1961 ( ending next June 30 ) . The money will be distributed among a variety of projects : developing the B70 super-bomber , modernizing Army equipment , building more Polaris submarines and missiles , increasing airlift capability , expanding the Strategic Air Command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samos . They are all expensive items , and the extra money will not go far among them . <P> Ike 's running quarrel with the Democrats over defense spending first took off last June . Congress revised the defense budget , adding here , subtracting there , wound up authorizing $1.2 billion more for defense than the President had asked for .

At his press conference last week , the touchiness suddenly flared into anger when a newsman asked about Lyndon Johnson 's charge that the President was still " freezing " the remainder of the extra $1.2 billion that Congress had voted . Ike denied that he had ever frozen any of the money . At any rate , about $476 million of it is now coming out of cold storage , and Ike may yet have to unfreeze more of it . <P> <P> * Now serving his second term as JCS chairman ( he stayed on at Ike 's behest ) , Air Force General Nate Twining , 62 , will retire before his term expires next August , the White House announced last week .
