The skyline of Manhattan-or of any other metropolis-would be completely different were it not for the Otis Elevator Co . Founder Elisha Graves Otis made the first safe and practical elevator in the middle of the 19th century . When steel beams and hanging walls made skyscrapers structurally possible , it was the availability of the elevator that made such heights practical . In the present worldwide boom in high-rise buildings , 110-year-old Otis is thriving as never before . Operating in all 50 states and in 43 countries , the company last year captured a dominant 40% of the world 's elevator business , and reported record sales of $351 million . <P> From Lions to Titans . Elevators of a sort were around long before Elisha Otis . Crude elevators run by manpower lifted stones for Cheops ' pyramid in 2900 B.C. , later carried gladiators and lions to the arena level of Rome 's Colosseum . There were even steam-powered elevators operating several years before Otis developed his , but Otis worked out a system of springs and ratchets that prevented elevators from falling when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in construction . <P> Department stores and tenements , which had rarely risen beyond five stories , began to top off at ten stories ; hotels , which had assigned their help to the top floors because of the long walk up , suddenly found the penthouse floors the most desirable for tenants . <P> <P> Growing from an early merger with eight competitors , Otis never lost its early lead . With more than 250,000 of its elevators in operation around the world , Otis does double the business of its only real competitor , Westinghouse , makes about 25% of its money by maintaining the elevators it installs . A battery of 58 Otises hum up and down the Empire State Building ; Otis elevators lift planes aboard the carriers Saratoga and Independence and promenaders aboard such liners as the France , the Leonardo da Vinci and Cunard 's Queens , raise Atlas and Titan missiles into firing positions at missile sites . <P> A Little Scare . Otis also manufactures escalators ( it is pushing a new one with glass balustrades ) , moving walkways , fork trucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the company 's business-and Otis never stops trying to improve on them . All of the elevators Otis makes today run without operators ( at a saving of $8,000 per car a year ) . They are so electronically sophisticated that they will not close their doors on a passenger ( though they may scare him a little by trying to ) , automatically program themselves for varying morning and evening traffic , and usually answer the call of a button within 25 seconds . President Percy L. Douglas , 60 , is concentrating on increasing the company 's worldwide business , and Otis now has 19,000 employees abroad .
