The Parrot A story by Isaac Bashevis Singer Translated by Ruth Whitman Outside the moon was shining , but in the prison cell it was almost dark . Although the single window was barred and screened , enough light filtered in to disclose parts of faces . New snow had fallen and gave a violet glow to the speck of sky which came through the window as through a sieve . By midnight it had become as cold as in the street and the prisoners had covered themselves with all the rags they had : cotton vests , jackets , overcoats . They slept in their caps , with rags stuffed in their shoes . In summer the chamber pot had given off a stench , but now the winter wind came in and blew away the odor . It had begun to get dark at half past three in the afternoon , and by six Stach the watchman put out the kerosene lamp . The prisoners went on talking for a little while until they fell asleep . Their snoring kept up till about one o'clock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awake was Wolf Ber the thief , a married man , a father of daughters . He yawned like a bell . Mottele Roiskes woke up with a belch , then Berele Zakelkover sat up and went to urinate . The three had already been there for months and had told one another all their stories . But this morning there was a new prisoner , a giant of a man with a snub nose , a straight neck , thickmoustaches the color of beer , dressed in a new jacket , tight high boots , and a cap lined with fur . He had brought a padded blanket and an additional pair of new boots which hung over his shoulders . He seemed like a big shot who had influence with the police . In the beginning they thought him a Gentile . They even spoke about him in thieves ' jargon . But he proved to be a Jew , a silent man , a misanthrope . When they spoke to him he scarcely answered . He stretched out on the bench and lay there for hours without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a piece of black bread , but he was in no hurry to eat . Wolf Ber asked him , " A word from you is like a gold coin , eh ? " To which he answered , Two coins . " They could n't get any more out of him . " Well , he 'll soften up , the snob , " Mottele Roiskes said . If this new inmate had been a weaker fellow , the others would have known what to do with him , but he had the shoulders and hands of a fighter . Such a man might have a hidden knife . As long as there was light , Wolf Ber , Mottele Roiskes and Berele Zakelkover played Sixty-six with a pack of marked cards . Then they went to sleep with heavy hearts . In prison it 's not good when a man thinks too highly of himself . But sooner or later he has to break down . Presently all three of them were silent and listened to the stranger . Since he did n't snore , it was hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words which he had spoken he pronounced with hard r 's , a sign that he was not from around Lublin . He must have come from Great Poland , on the other side of the Vistula . Then what was he doing in the prison at Yanev ? They seldom sent anyone from so far away . Mottele Roiskes was the first to talk . " What time can it be ? " Nobody answered . " What happened to the rooster ? " he continued . " He stopped crowing . " " Maybe it 's too cold for him to crow , " Berele Zakelkover answered . " Too cold ? They get warm from crowing . There was a teacher in our town , Reb Itchele , who said that when a rooster crows he burns behind his wings . That 's the reason he flaps his wings  --  to cool off . " " What nonsense , " Wolf Ber growled . " It 's probably written in a holy book . " " A holy book can also say silly things . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gemara know what 's happening behind a rooster 's wings ? They sit in the study house and they invent things . " " They know some things . A preacher came to us and he said that all the philosophers wanted to know how long a snake is pregnant and nobody knew . But they asked a tanna and he said seven years . " " So long ? " They became quiet ; conversation petered out . Berele Zakelkover began to scratch his foot . He suffered from an eczema . He scratched and hissed softly at the same time . Suddenly the stranger said in a deep voice , " A snake is not pregnant seven years , perhaps not even seven months . " All became tense . All became cheerful . " How do you know how long a snake is pregnant ? " Wolf Ber asked . " Do you breed snakes ? " " No creature is pregnant seven years . How long does a snake live ? " " There are all kinds of snakes . " Isaac Hashevis Singer 's many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include " The Slave " and " Short Friday . " His new book , " In . My Father 's Court , " is an autobiographical work from his childhood in Warsaw , where his father was a rabbi . ( It was published by Farrar , Straus &; Giroux in May . ) Since 1985 Mr. Singer has written for the " Jewish Daily Forward " in New York City . " How can the Gemara know ? To know you have to keep two snakes in the house , a he and a she , and let them mate . " " Perhaps God told him . " " Yes . " They became quiet again . The stranger was now sitting up . One could barely see his silhouette but his eyes reflected the gold of the moon . After a little while he said , " God says nothing . God is silent . " " He spoke to Moses . " " I was n't there . " " An unbeliever , eh ? " " How can you know what God said to Moses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Pentateuch , but who wrote the Pentateuch ? With a pen you can write anything . I come from Kalisch where there are two rabbis . When one pronounced a thing kosher , the other said unkosher . Before Passover the miller asked one of them to make the mill kosher . So the other one got angry that he had n't received ten roubles and he said the Passover flour was unkosher . Does all this come from God ? " Mottele Roiskes was about to answer , but Wolf Ber interrupted . " If you are from Kalisch , what are you doing here ? " " That 's a different matter . " " What do you mean ? " The stranger gave no reply . The stillness became heavy and tense . " Do you have a smoke ? " the stranger asked . " We 're all out . " " I can do without food , but I have to have u smoke . Can you get it from the watchman ? " " We have no money . " " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even in the clink , " Wolf Ber answered . " But not now . Wait until morning . " " The winter nights are rough , " Berele Zakelkover began to say . " You go to sleep with the chickens , and by twelve o'clock you 're already slept out . You lie in the dark and all kinds of thoughts come into your mind . Here you 've got to talk or you 'll go crazy . " " What is there to talk about ? " the stranger asked . " There 's a proverb : man spouts , God flouts . I 'm not an unbeliever , but God sits in the seventh heaven and snaps his fingers at everything . " " Why did they put you in this cage ? " Wolf Bar asked . " For singing psalms . " " No , I 'm serious . " The stranger was silent . " A big pile , eh ? " No pile at all . I 'm not a thief and I do n't like anyone to steal from me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's the reason I 'm here now . " " In what yeshiva did they keep you before ? " " First in Kielc and then in Lublin . " " Did you polish off someone ? " " Yes , that 's exactiy what I did . " 2 The stranger stretched out on the bench again . Berele Zakelkover went back to scratching his foot . Mottele Roiskes asked , " Are you going to stay here ? " " They 'll probably send me to Siberia . " Wolf Ber walked over to the window . " A blizzard . " " It 's a sin to let out a dog in weather like this , " Mottele Roiskes said . " I 'd like to be the dog , " Berele joked . The stranger sat up again . He leaned his back against the wall and supported his chin on his knees . Broken moon rays reflected on his shiny boot tops . He said , " So what if they let you out ? In half a year you 'd be sitting here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything to sneeze at . " " This is the last time for me , " Wolf Ber said , both to himself and to the stranger . " I 've eaten enough half-baked bread . I have a wife and children . " " That 's the usual song they all sing , " remarked the stranger . " Where do you all come from ? From Piask ? " " You 're a thief yourself . " " I 'm not a thief , and till now I was n't a murderer , I could always swap blows , but for many years I 've never touched anyone , not even a fly . " " So what happened all of a sudden ? " Wolf Ber asked . The stranger hesitated . " It was fated . " " Who did you finish off ? A merchant ? " " A woman . " " Your own wife ? " " No . She was n't my wife . " " Did you catch her red-handed ? " The stranger gave no answer . He seemed to doze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It all happened because of a bird . " " A bird ? No kidding . " " It 's the truth . " " What kind of a bird ? " " A parrot . " " Tell us about it . If you hold it in , you 'll lose your mind . " a story by Isaac Bashet'is Singer 61 " That would n't be so bad , but you ca n't choose when to lose your mind . I 'm a horse dealer , or rather , that 's what I was . They knew me in Kalisch as Simon the horse trader . My father also dealt in horses , my grandfather too . When the horse thieves in Ralisch tried to sell me bargains , I sent them packing . 1 did n't need stolen goods . Sometimes I used to buy a half-dead nag , but under my care it recovered . I love animals , all animals . We 're a family of horse traders . My wife died two years after our marriage and for thirteen years I was alone . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no child . I had a house , stables , I kept a Gentile maid  --  not a young shiksa , an older woman . And not for what you think either . I lived , as they say , respectably . The matchmakers proposed all kinds of women , but I did n't like any of them . I 'm one of those men who must love , and if I do n't love a woman , I ca n't live with her ; it 's as simple as that . " " A ha . ' " I like animals . For me a horse is not just a horse . When I sold a horse , I wanted to know to whom I was selling it . There was a coachman in our town who used to whip the horses , and I refused to sell to him . For sixteen years I traded in horses and I never lifted a whip to one . You can get anything out of an animal with good treatment . It 's the same with a horse , a dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them ; they even guess your thoughts . Animals see in the dark and have a better memory than men . Many times I 've lost my way and my horses have led me to the right spot . The snow might be knee-deep , but my horses would take roe to the peasant 's but and stop in front of it . Sometimes my horse would even turn his head , as though to say , ' Here it is , Boss . ' " If you 're alone , you have time to observe these creatures . Besides horses , I had dogs , cats , rabbits , a cow , a goat . I lived in the suburbs because in the city you ca n't keep a big stable , you ca n't take a horse to pasture . Oats and hay are good in winter , but in summer a horse needs fresh grass . green grass with flowers and all the rest . The peasants hobble their horses and leave them all night in the pasture , but a hobbled animal is like a hobbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I made a fence around my pasture , and the peasants laughed at me . It does n't pay to build a fence around six acres of land , they told me , but I did n't want to hobble my horses , or let them stray into strange fields and get beaten . That 's how I used to be before I became a murderer . " " What about the bird ? " " Wait . I 'm coming to that . I kept fowl , and birds too . In the beginning , they were n't in my house but under the roof and in the granary . Storks used to come after Passover from the warm countries and build nests on my roof . They did n't have to build new ones , they just mended last year 's nests after the rain and snow . Under the eaves , starlings had built theirs . People believe that crows bring bad luck but actually crows are clever birds . I also had pigeon cotes . Some people eat squabs but I never tasted one . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to be a regular saint . " " I 'm not a saint , but when you live in the suburbs you see all sorts of things . A bird flies in with a broken wing . A dog comes in limping . I 'm not softhearted , but when you see a bird tottering on the ground and not able to lift itself up , you want to help it . I once took such a bird into my house and kept it until its wing was healed . I bandaged it like a doctor . Of course , the Jews laughed at me , but what do Jews know about animals ? Some Gentiles understood . in summer my windows are wide open . As long as a bird wants to it can stay and get its seed . When it 's healthy again , it flies away . Once a bird returned to me , not alone , but with a wife . I was sitting on a stool fixing a saddle , and suddenly two birds flew in . I recognized the male immediately because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shelf and sang me a good morning . It was like a dream . " Matchmakers used to come to me and propose all kinds of arrangements , but when I looked over the merchandise , she never pleased me . One was ugly , the other fat , the third one talked too much ? I ca n't stand chatterboxes . Animals are silent ; that 's why I love them . " " A parrot talks . " " Yes . " " Well , what else ? " " Nothing . The years go by . One day it 's my wife 's first anniversary , then the second , then the eighth . Other horse dealers became rich , but I just made a living . I did n't fool the customer . I decided how much profit I wanted and that was all . I got used to being alone . " " What did you do when you needed a female ? " " What do you do ? " In a prison you have no choice . " If you do n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were whores in Kalisch , but when I looked at them , I felt like vomiting . You could get a peasant girl or even a woman , but they were all lousy . Mine was a clean one . Each night she combed her hair . In the summer we bathed in a pond . She died from a lump in her breast . Theycut it out but it grew again . Such suffering I do n't wish my worst enemy . " " Was she beautiful ? " " A princess . " 3 it Well , what about the parrot ? " " Wait . Where can I begin ? I 'm not a grandmother and I do n't tell grandmothers ' tales . Gypsies used to come to me to sell horses , but I never bought them . First of all , they 're thieves . Second , their horses are seldom healthy and , if you 're not an expert , you find the defect later . But I see everything the first minute . The gypsies knew that they could n't put anything over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast , millet with milk . I used to eat the same thing every morning . I always had a sack full of it for myself and for the birds . As I sat there , I saw a gypsy woman , a fat black one with large earrings and many strings of beads around her neck . She came in and said , ' Master , show me your hand . ' I had never been to a fortune-teller ; I did n't believe in it . Besides , what is the good of knowing things in advance ? What must happen will happen . But for some reason , I gave her my hand and she looked at my right palm and clucked in dismay . Then she asked for my left hand . ' Why do you need my left hand ? ' I asked . She said , ' The right one shows your fortune and the left one the fortune of your wife . ' ' But I have no wife , ' I said . ' My wife died . ' And she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When will she come ? ' I asked . ' She will fly into your window like a bird . ' ' Will she have wings ? ' I asked . She smiled and showed her white teeth . I gave her a few groschen and a slice of bread , and she left . I paid no attention to her talk . Who cares about the babble of gypsies ? But somehow the words were stored in my head , and I remembered them and thought about them . Sometimes an idea ticks in your mind and you ca n't get rid of it . " Now listen to what happened . They had just called me into a village to buy horses and I stayed overnight . The next day I came riding home with four horses , one my own mare and three which had bought from a peasant . I walked into my house and there was a parrot . I did n't believe my own eyes . Local birds flew in and out , but where did a parrot come from ? Parrots are not of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me as though he had been expecting me . He was as green as an unripe lemon but on his wings he had dark spots and his neck was yellow . He was not a large parrot , in fact he seemed a young one . I gave him some millet and he ate it . I held out a saucer of water and he drank . I stretched out a finger to him and he perched on it like an old friend . I forgot all my business . I loved him immediately like my own child . In the beginning , I wanted to close the window , because he could fly out as easily as he flew in . But it was summer , and besides , I thought , if he 's destined to stay here , he 'll stay . " He did n't fly away . I bought him a cage , put in a saucer of millet , a dish of water , vegetables , a little mirror , and whatever else a bird needs . I named him Metzotze and the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he just clucked and cawed . Then suddenly he began to speak in a strange language . It must have been gypsy talk because it was n't Polish or Russian or Yiddish . He must have escaped from the gypsies . " The moment he came I knew that what the gypsy foretold would come true . Somehow I felt that this would happen . The summer was over and winter was coming on . I closed the windows to keep the house warm . He began to talk Yiddish and call me Simon , and when the Gentiles spoke in Polish he imitated them . The moment I entered the room he would fly up to my shoulder . When I went to the stable he stayed sitting there . He put his beak to my ear and played with my earlobe , telling me secrets in bird language . In the begin-fling I did n't know if he was a he or a she , but a magician passed by and told me it was a he . I began to look for a wife for him and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " A strange story , " Mottele Roiskes interrupted . " Just wait . Once I had to go to an estate to deliver horses , but since I loved my Metzotze so much , it was hard for me to leave him . But how do they say it ? ? making a living is like waging a war . I took my horses and went to the estate . I told my niaid  --  Tekla was her name  --  that she should watch the parrot like the eyes in her head . I did n't have to tell her  --  she was attached to the bird herself , as was my stable man . In a word , he was not among strangers . I sold my horses for a good price and everything went as smoothly as on greased wheels . I wanted to go home , but new business came up . The bird had brought me luck . I had to spend the night at an inn and the moment I entered I saw a woman small , dark , with black eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiarly as though I were an old friend . Outside , there was a blizzard , much as today , and we were the only guests . The landlady heated a samovar for us , but I said , " Perhaps you have some vodka ? " I 'm not a drunkard but in business you sometimes have to drink . When the deal is finished the buyer and the seller strike their palms together and have a drink . The landlady brought us 64 THE PARROT a bottle and a bowl of pretzels . I asked the woman , ' Perhaps you want to taste some ? ' and she answered , ' Why not ? I 'm still able to enjoy life . ' I poured a full glass for her and she tossed it off as if it were nothing at all . She did n't even take a pretzel afterwards . I saw that she could pour it down . When the landlady went to see a peasant about a cow , we were left alone . I took a glass , she took a glass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a large bottle and still stay sober . I was afraid she would get fuddled but she sat there and smiled , and we just became more cheerful and familiar . We talked like old cronies . She told me her name was Esther , and she came from somewhere in Volhynia . ' What is a young woman doing alone in an inn ? ' I asked her . " I 'm waiting for a smuggler . ' " ' What do you need a smuggler for ? ' I asked , and she told me she was going to America . ' What 's wrong with this country ? ' " She told me she had had an affair and the man left her . She learned that he had a wife . He was a traveling salesman , one of those skirt chasers who thinks tricking a woman is something to boast about . ' Well , ' she said , ' I played and lost . I could n't show my face at home anymore . ' It came out that she had had a husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and it was below his dignity . In short , she had to leave . Some smuggler was going to lead her to the German border . " ' What will you do in faraway America ? ' I said . And she answered , ' Sew blouses . If you do something silly you have to pay for it . ' I poured her a fourth glass , a fifth glass . She said , Why did n't I meet you before ? A man like you would make a good husband for me . ' ' It 's never too late , ' I said . Why should I drag it out ? By the time the landlady came back from the peasant , everything was settled between us . I was drawn to her as to a magnet and she felt the same way . We held hands , kissed , and her kissing drove you crazy . She was n't a female , she was a piece of fire . I did n't want the landlady to know what was going on and I went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fever . She slept right next door and I heard through the thin wall how she tossed on her bed . At dawn I fell asleep and in the morning I had to leave . We had already decided that she was going with me . The whole business of America was out . She did n't need a smuggler any more . " I came out of my room and found my woman already packed and ready . She smiled at me and her eyes shone . When the landlady heard that she was going with me , she understood what had happened , but what did I care ? My heart was with Esther . I took her in my sleigh and she sat near me on the driver 's seat . She was afraid of falling and she held on to me and excited me all over again . Riding along we decided to get married . We did n't need any special ceremonies . I was a widower and she a divorc  --  e . We would go to Getzel , the assistant rabbi , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her about the bird and she said , ' I will be a mother to him . ' We spoke about him as though he would be our child . " " Did you really marry her ? " Wolf Ber asked . " No . " " Why not ? " " Because she was divorced and I was a Cohen . I had forgotten the law . " " Who reminded you ? The assistant rabbi ? " " Who else ? " " What a story I " 4 When Rabbi Getzel told me that we could n't marry , I wanted to tear him to pieces , but was it his fault ? I never went to pray except at Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur . Suddenly I was a Cohen , descended from a priestly line ! I took Esther and went home with her . ' Let 's pretend that I 'm a Catholic priest and you 're my housekeeper . ' I lived far from the city and nobody would look through the keyhole . At first , she was disappointed . What should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much in love that we could barely wait till night . Metzotze immediately became pals with her . The moment she entered he perched on her shoulder and she kissed him on the beak , and he kissed back . I said to her , ' He 's our matchmaker , ' and I told her the story about the gypsy and all the rest of it . " In the beginning everything went well . We lived like two doves . They gossiped about us in the city , but who cared ? So what if Simon the horse dealer is n't pious ? So they wo n't call me up to the reading of the scroll . Well , but Esther wanted a baby and that was bad . It would mean that the baby would be a bastard . Some student from the study house told me that such a baby is not exactly a bastard , but is called by some other name . But it 's bad just the same . Esther had written to her parents that she got married and they wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied to be alone with her . Esther and Metzotze were enough for me . But she only wanted to go to town . She asked me if I had friends , wanted to invite guests to show off with her cooking and baking . Her cooking was fit for a king . She could bake a cake which you could n't match in the best bakeries . She dressed nicely too , but for whom ? In the fields she wore a corset . She tried to persuade me to go with her to America . I wish I had listened to her , but I had no desire to travel thousands of miles . I had a house , stables , grounds . If you have to sell all this you get almost nothing in return . What could I do in America ? Press pants ? Besides , I was so attached to the bird that I could n't leave him . And it 's not so easy to drag a parrot over borders and oceans . I was attached to my mare too . And where could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if she fell into the hands of a coachman , he would whip her to pieces . I said to Esther , ' We love each other , let 's live quietly . Who cares what people babble about ? ' But she was only drawn to people . She went to the city , made acquaintances , entangled herself with low characters and the devil knows what . I let her persuade me to invite a few horse dealers to a party , but in the years when I was a widower I had kept away from everybody and no one wanted to come to the suburbs . Those who came did us a great favor . After they left Esther burst into tears and she cried until daybreak " Why drag it out ? We began to quarrel . I mean , she quarreled . She scolded , she cursed , she cried and screamed that I had trapped her . Why did n't I tell her I was a Cohen ? I did n't remember that I was a Cohen any more than you remember what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me at night and kept talking as though possessed by a dybbuk . One moment she laughed ; the next moment she cried . She was putting on an act , but for whom ? She talked to herself and did such strange things that you would n't believe it was the same Esther . She called me names that you do n't hear in my part of the country . Suddenly she began to be hostile to the bird . He screamed too much , he dirtied the house , he did n't let her sleep at night . She was jealous too , complaining that I loved him more than I did her . " When this began I knew that it would have a bad ending . Was it Metzotze 's fault ? He was as good as an angel . At night he was quiet . but in the morning a bird does n't lie under a quilt and snore . A bird begins to sing at daybreak . Esther , however , went to sleep at two o'clock in the morning , and at eleven at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cake . I saw I was in a mess , but what could I do ? One minute she was sane , the next minute crazy . There 's a teahouse in Kaliseh where all the scum gather together . She kept on dragging me there . I sat and drank tea while she made friends with all the roughnecks . She met some strange nobody and told him all our secrets . I must have been stronger than iron not to bury myself from shame . She could be clever , a story by Isaac Baslievis Singer 65 but when she wanted she could act like the worst fool . It was all from spite , but what did I do to deserve it ? Another man in my place would take her by the hair and throw her out , but I get used to a person . Also , I have pity . " I can tell you , it became worse from day to day . I never knew what Gehenna was , but I had Gehenna in my own house . She picked quarrels with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had never touched her , but Esther suspected the worst . She was only looking for excuses to make trouble . She also began to pick fights with the stable boy . For years both had worked for me with devotion . Now they had to run away , and in my business you need help . You ca n't do everything by yourself . Horses have to be scrubbed and groomed . There are imps that come into the stables at night . Do n't laugh at me . I did n't believe it either until I saw it with my own eyes . I would buy a horse and put him in the stable . I 'd come in the morning and he was bathed in sweat as though he had been driven all night long over hills and ditches . He was foaming at the mouth . I would look at the mane and it would be in pigtails . Who would come at night to braid pigtails on a horse ? It happened not once but ten times . These imps can torture a horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and keep watch . But when the groom left , I had to do his work too . In short , it was had . When I talked she flared up ; when I was silent she complained that I ignored her . She was only looking for something to pick on . I could n't write , and she tried to teach me . She gave me one lesson and that was it . We played cards just to kill time , but she cheated . Why did she have to cheat ? I gave her enough money . " " For such a piece of merchandise there is only one remedy , " said Wolf Ber . " A good swat in the k i sser . " " Just what I wanted to say , " Mottele Roiskes chimed in . " I tried that too . But I have a heavy hand and when I give a blow I can cripple someone . If I touched her I had to pay the doctor . She also threatened to denounce me . But what was there to denounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from religious . but if she felt like it she could become pious . To make a fire on the Sabbath was all right , but to pour out the slops was forbidden . She changed the rules whenever it suited her . The women in the city knew of my misfortune and laughed in my face . " It happened two years ago in the winter . I do n't know how it was here , but around Ralisch there were terrible frosts . Old men could n't remember such cold , and heating the stoves did n't help . The wind blew and broke the trees . On my place , the wind tore off a piece of the fence . Usually it 's warm in the stable , but I was afraid for my horses , for when a horse catches cold it 's the end . To this day I do n't remember what we quarreled about that evening , but then , when did n't we quarrel ? It was one long war . Sometimes at night we made peace for a few minutes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept in the bed and I on a bench . When I had to get up , she went to sleep . Pin a light sleeper  --  it 's easy to disturb me . She crept around , boiled tea , moved chairs ; she began to say the Shema and suddenly she burst out laughing like mad . She was n't mad  --  she did it to spite me . She knew that I loved the parrot and she had it in for him . A parrot comes from a warm climate and if he catches a draft , he 's finished . But she opened the doors and let the wind blow in . He could have flowri away because he was an animal , not a man with understanding . I told her clearly , ' If anything happens to Metzotze , it 's all over with you . ' And she screamed , Go and marry him . A Cohen is allowed to marry a parrot . ' I know now that it was all predestined . It 's written on a man 's palm or on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will do this and that . But what did she have against me ? I did n't stop her from going to America . I was even ready to pay her expenses . " Where am I ? Oh . Yes , I warned her , ' You can do with me whatever you want , but do n't take it out on Metzotze . ' Nonetheless , she screamed at him and scolded him as though he were a man . ' He 's scabby , lousy , a demon 's in him , ' and so on . You know , a bird needs to have darkness at night . When a lamp is lit , he thinks it 's day . She kept on lighting the candles , and the bird could n't stand light at night and tucked his head under his wing . What does a bird need ? A few grains of seed and a little sleep . How can a man torture a bird ? One night I heard noises in the stable . I took my lantern and went to look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew there would be misfortune . " For a while all was silent . Then Wolf Ber asked , " What did she do ? Chase out the parrot ? " The stranger began to murmur and to clear his throat . " Yes , in the middle of the night , in a burning frost . " " He was n't found , huh ? " " He flew away . " " And you finished her , huh ? " The stranger paused . " As I came back from the stable and I saw that the parrot was n't there , I went over to her and said , ' Esther , it 's your end . ' I grabbed her by the hair , took her outside , and threw her into the well . " " She did n't fight back ? " " No , she went quietly . " " Still , one has to be a murderer to do something like that , " Mottele Roiskes remarked . " I am a murderer . " " What else ? " " Nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what I did , take me . ' " " Iti the middle of the night ? " " It was already beginning to get light . " " Did they let you go to the funeral ? " " No funeral . " " They say that a Cohen is an angry man , " Berele Zakelkover threw in . " It looks that way . " " How much did they give you ? " " Eight years . " " Well , you got off easy . " " I 'll never get out , " the stranger said . For a long while all were quiet . Then the stranger said , " Metzotze is still around . " " What do you mean ? " " You 'll think I 'm crazy , but what do I care ? " " What do you mean , around ? " " He comes to me . He perches on my shoulder . " " Are you dreaming ? " " No , it 's the truth . " " You imagine it . " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that case you 're a little touched . " " He sleeps on my forehead . " " Well , you 're out of your mind . " " A parrot has a soul . " " Nonsense , " Wolf Ber said . " If a parrot has a soul , so has a chicken . If all the chickens , geese , and ducks had souls , the world would be full of souls . " " All 1 know is that Metzotze visits me . " " It 's because you miss him so much . " " He comes , he kisses me on the mouth . He flutters his tail against my ear . " " Will he come here too ? " " Perhaps . " " And how will he know that they sent you to Yanev ? " " He knows everything . " " Nonsense . Tell it to the doctor .. They 'll send you to the nuthousb . It 's easy to run away from there . What about Esther ? Does she visit you too ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead are dead . Men as well as animals . " The stranger stretched out on the bench again . " I know the truth . "
