txt Washington , Nov. 24-Secretary of the Treasury Henry H. Fowler said today that " I heartily approve and , indeed , applaud , " French President Charles de Gaulle 's refusal to devaluate the franc , a move Fowler said will not threaten the United States dollar . Fowler cautioned that the dollar is not immune " to the developments in any of our financial or trading quarters , " but he maintained that the dollar " has become rather strong " in recent months . Fowler appeared on Face the Nation , a CBS television interview show . Deficit Nearly Balanced The strength of the dollar in world monetary circles has been increased , Fowler said , because the United States has successfully shifted from a position of last year , when the nation had a balance-of-payments deficit of 25 billion dollars , to one of near balance . The current deficit of about 3 billion dollars puts the dollar " in a much-improved position , " he said . Fowler said he was " not surprised " by de Gaulle 's decision not to lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative , he said , was to devalue the franc so slightly as not to upset the delicate balance of other currencies , which could also have been forced into a devaluation . Expects Franc Improvement France 's difficulties with the franc , Fowler said , were caused by " speculative outflows " of gold reserves . He said there is now " substantial reason to believe that the events of the past week and the position that has been taken by de Gaulle will go a long way to halt " the outflows . Because of the French monetary situation and the continuing war in Viet Nam , Fowler said he felt that President Johnson 's 10 per cent surcharge on federal income taxes should be continued " so that there be no doubt about the strength of the dollar . " The surcharge should be as sessed " possibly at the same level , " depending on " expenditure levels " in domestic programs and the war , he said . When the surcharge expires on July 1 , he said , the United States should not allow itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could threaten the dollar abroad . But Fowler conceded that the surcharge has not had the desired effect of dampening inflationary growth of the American economy as had been expected .
