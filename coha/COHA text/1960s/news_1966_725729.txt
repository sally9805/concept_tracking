txt Mayor Richard .1 . Daley Man in the middle As racial violence simmers and crackles through city after city this summer many Americans  --  white and black  --  are asking almost unanswerable questions : Why must this go on ? Whn is to blame ? What can be done to stop it ? And if we ca n't stop it , where and when will it . all end ? There are , of course , no easy answers , as governmental officials have long known . This is especially apparent here . Chicago is the Northern target city of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr . He has been pushing into hostile white neighborhoods . The conflict has become so serious that Police Superintendent . Orlando Wilson warns that . Chicago may face full-scale race riots ? white against black ? if tensions can not be cased . Mayor Hichard .1 . Daley , who 1.1 months ago proudly said his city had had no racial strife and expected none , has seen so much violence this summer that he is devoting almost all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his City Hall office , Mr. Daley told of some efforts to solve the city 's racial problems . Without fanfare he toured the West Side slum after recent riots and met with Negroes // *Chicago 's Mayor Daley protests Negro pressure on city // from the area to learn first hand of the causes and problems . " One thing I found was that the majority of people who live there are concerned about safety and are not in accord with the looting , burning , and rioting , " he said . Negro problems listed But Negroes also talked of their problems : employment , poor housing , education , the need for police protection both on the streets and in the high-rise housing projects . In spite of his intense pride in Chicago , the Mayor does not gloss over these problems . Instead , he points to programs , most federally backed , to correct the faults . ? Guards will be hired for stairwells and elevators of all high-rise Chicago Housing Authority Housing projects . ? Bell-and-buzzer systems will he installed in all three-and-four-story walk-ups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman of the housing authority to " foster integration . " ? Three " comprehensive neighborhood health centers " are being opened as part of the war on poverty . Included are : prenatal care , infant care , pediatric care , diagnosis and treatment for acute illness , health education , mental-health services , acute and chronic long-term care of ambulatory patients , in-patient hospital care , family nursing service , and dental health care . " I believe the health services offered in Chicago excel anything in the United States . " he says . Tenant cooperation sought ? A promise that all slum housing will be eliminated by the end of next year . ( This does not mean removal of all old buildings that are structurally sound but a mess inside because of tenant or owner neglect . ) ? **25;60;TOOLONG specialists have been moved into each of the seven urban-progress centers ( Chicago 's poverty program branch offices ) to help upgrade 50,000 structures housing some 700,000 persons . " The emphasis in this program will be missing rehabilitation as structural rehabilitation , " he explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing problems without tenant cooperation and understanding of how to live in an urban society . " This will be done through housekeeping and personal-care classes and block meetings on improving housing conditions . ? Under the federal-rent-subsidy program some families living in public-housing projects will be " promoted " to private housing , with government paying a maximum of $82 a month for an efficiency apartment and $179 for a five-bedroom apartment . This will make more room for needy families in existing housing projects and give those who move into private housing a chance to expand their horizons by living side by side with more successful neighbors and learning how to achieve this success for themselves . ? Some $3 million in federal funds will be used to purchase substandard dwellings and either demolish them or repair them . These will be sold with down payments as low as 1 percent , with contract interest rates of 3 percent . Rodent control cited ? The city will continue with its stepped-up program of building-code enforcement and receivership . The list is far longer , including the city 's gargantuan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation . The Mayor is especially proud of the rodent-control program , where rat holes are sealed in private dwellings with metal and concrete and rodents are poisoned and insects fumigated . More than 21,000 buildings have been checked . Of these , more than 9,000 buildings housing 313,000 people have been treated , he says . Negro unemployment was tackled more than a year ago . More than 1,130 companies employing 800,000 people have signed pledges that they will hire on a nondiscriminatory basis and that all promotions will be made regardless of race , creed , or color . Up to 10,000 Chicago youngsters are working on neighborhood Youth Corps projects . Some 54,000 youngsters between the ages of four and five are involved in Project Head Start . Another 4,000 are receiving remedial education in a program called " Pushup , " he says . The Chicago Commission on Human Relations was the first such commission in the nation , according to Mayor Daley . With all this and more going on here , Mayor Daley puzzles over why Dr. King picked Chicago as his target city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstration city " in the housing field  --  and federal money would be made available to rebuild or remove every substandard structure in the city ? it could n't be clone overnight . Recent arrivals The Mayor also explains that the tremendous influx of Negroes in the past 25 years  --  bringing with them a multitude of problems ? is not the fault of his administration . Studies show that 51 percent of the Chicago Negroes are recent arrivals from the South , he says . Many have little or no education and lack the work skills and social awareness needed in an urban industrial area . " They came here for a reason , " he says . " They must have found some very attractive things  --  both job opportunities and education , " Ile adds . In spite of these efforts to change conditions and help the people help themselves , civil-rights leaders keep up their pressure . And whites continue to balk . To many political observers Mr. Daley is the most powerful , and perhaps most capable city official in the United States . They consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best in the country . And there are other department heads of stature . Yet  --  and other cities should take note ? it is becoming apparent that Mayor Daley is finding it more and more difficult to keep his city under control . This is largely because Dr. King and other civil-rights leaders talk of turning Chicago into a northern Selma or Birmingham . The strategy is to keep the city off balance and to squeeze Mayor Daley so tightly between aroused white and black factions that he will have no room to maneuver . These efforts are succeeding . Press warns of violence Many observers here say that responsibility for provoking or preventing a bloody race riot now rests largely upon Dr. King 's shoulders , If his followers march into Cicero , a working man 's suburb , or into other southwest neighborhoods as they have promised , many officials fear it could make violent past incidents look like a third-grade picnic . In a recent lead editorial , the Chicago Daily News , usually sympathetic of civil-rights efforts , said of Dr. King 's Chicago activities : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago . " He succeeded , with his nonviolent marches into white neighborhoods , in demonstrating that Negroes in Chicago live in a ghetto ; that ours is not an open society ; that the invisible bars against Negro expansion into adjacent white areas are as hard as iron : that hate and prejudice in Chicago are not unlike hate and prejudice in Alabama . ... " The News warns that in proposed marches in " west . suburban Cicero and the far southwest area called Bogan . . . the potentials for serious violence . ? . are obviously great .. . . " And then it urges him to " call off the marches entirely and turn to more constructive pursuits . " The pressures are growing . Influential people like the Roman Catholic Archbishop here have publicly urged him to end the marches . Until now Dr. King has been able to count on strong Catholic support . And now other churchmen are backing off . What of the white residents ? Mayor Daley will not say so , but he is clearly concerned that there will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many feel he has already . done too much for the Negro . Mrs. Joseph Medek is president of the Hurley Homeowners Civic Association in Chicago Lawn , where white violence has flared when Negroes march . It is a lowermiddle-income neighborhood . She explains that this section of Chicago was " just a prairie " 18 years ago . In many households both the husband and wife work to pay off the mortgage . Concern over saturation ' Why do they live here ? Many gave up homes closer to Lake Michi- , gan when Negroes started moving into their old neighborhoods . Bluntly , they ran . Mrs. Medek says the people who have worked so long and hard to buy these homes ? prices run from around $20,000 to a few at $40,000 ? are in their middle years . And they don't. want to have to run again . Others talk about " saturation " instead of mere integration . One Negro family moves in , and other Negroes take over . Now there are strong hints that real-estate men and residents of some all-white areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  a few carefully screened Negro families settling in each neighborhood . But even this is bothersome to many residents . As violence explodes in other cities  --  Cleveland , Detroit , Omaha , South Bend , Lansing , and Minneapolis in the Midwest  --  there are many Americans asking where it will all end . No one  --  including Dr. King  --  seems to have the answer .
