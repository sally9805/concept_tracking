The 1964 presidential campaign has been one of the most disappointing ever . It was going to be a confrontation between opposing philosophies ; it turned out to be a wrestling match be tween volatile personalities . It was go ing to prove the vital difference be tween two strong political parties ; it has merely shown that one , the G.O.P. , is in need of great repair . It was going to pit liberal against conservative ; but Lyndon Johnson has stated very few liberal tenets , and many an American conservative now doubts that Barry Goldwater really speaks his language . It was not going to be a " me too " cam paign ; it has turned out to be one in which the principals largely shout " You 're another . " <P> Bombshells . To be sure , Goldwater began with a disadvantage . He had to run against peace , prosperity and an in cumbent President who , many thought , probably deserved a full term of his own . Thus , from the very start , Goldwater was told by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He ob viously felt that he would have to drop bombshells if he were to make a decent showing . Bombshells he dropped - and some exploded in his face . <P> His imprecise use of the language often made it difficult to know just where he stood , as did his offhand treatment of serious subjects . It also laid him open to misinterpretation . Is Goldwater really anxious to plunge the world into nuclear war ? Of course not . <P> <P> But millions of voters wondered . Time after time-on nuclear policy , farm subsidies , civil rights , TVA and social security-he seemed to take a firm stand , backed away , then complained bitterly about having been misquoted . More important , he made almost no major speech calculated to win him any new votes beyond those of the diehard , pre-San Francisco Goldwaterites . <P> But if Goldwater togged up the campaign , Johnson filled it with pettifoggery . Confident of victory , he had a readymade opportunity to set forth national policies and win a mandate for them . But he put off any action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and talked about , urgent matters only in generalities . He failed to deliver on his own pre-campaign pledge to furnish a blueprint for " the Great Society . " He preferred to point his finger at church steeples and cry of his critics : " God forgive them , for they really know not what they do . " <P> Bestsellers . Thus , what the campaign has really come down to is a back-alley fight featuring such pejorative words and phrases as " liar , " " demagogue , " " socialist , " " irresponsible , " " reckless , " " soft on Communism , " and " fascist . " Scurrilous paperback books about both candidates have become bestsellers . Vicious television commercials have depicted Goldwater as a man willing to sprinkle a little girl 's ice cream with cancer-causing strontium 90.
