The " education major " is doomed in California . In what Thomas W. Braden , president of the state board of education , calls a deathblow to " educationese , " the state is drastically upgrading its teacher certification requirements . Ultimately , California will turn down all applicants whose sole or chief training is in the methodology of teaching . Instead , it will demand degrees in academic subjects , stressing substance over technique . <P> So sweeping is the change , says Braden , that if used to gauge California 's current teachers , the new standards would disqualify 20% of high school teachers , 75% of junior college instructors , and 90% of elementary school teachers . " Professional education " is no longer an acceptable major . Would-be administrators will have to major in academic fields , from science to humanities . New teachers must minor or major in those fields , although they may also take degrees in nonacademic subjects such as home economics or industrial art . All must have a working knowledge of a foreign language . <P> Extra Schooling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all school teachers , although elementary teachers can take it while working . In contrast to past practice , schools will not let teachers teach outside their academic fields-will no longer plunk an English teacher in French class to save money , for example . The so-called " Einstein Clause " is in full force ; able artists or writers are welcome to teach in California public schools even if they never had a day 's formal education . <P> " What we want , " says Board President Braden , " is teachers who are educated in the whole sense , people with the initial experience of thorough knowledge of some field . Most education majors are not really educated . They have never really delved into a subject as far as they could . " Such talk has won Braden solid support from the state legislature , and fierce opposition " from the great education complex . Their feelings are hurt . " As well they might be : thousands of California public school people are being told in effect that they are not good enough . <P> Stolen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions , which have to get more academic or practically go out of business . Also affected : many education schools in other states , which supply nearly one-third of California 's new teachers . California itself may be in for initial trouble : a shortage of teachers able to meet the new standards . <P> California 's reform fits the conservative principles of the state 's self-styled education " reformer , " Max Rafferty , the back-to-basics new superintendent of public instruction , but he had nothing to do with bringing it about . It is mainly the long-planned work of Tom Braden , 45 , a wartime OSS-CIA man who went on to become an English professor at Dartmouth , his alma mater , and is now editor-publisher of the Blade-Tribune in Oceanside . Rafferty rooters recently flooded Sacramento in a vain effort to stop Braden 's reappointment to the state board of education , apparently because Braden opposed Rafferty 's election last November . Net effect : Braden has stolen a good deal of Rafferty 's thunder .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
