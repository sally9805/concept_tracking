The abstract mural in Boston 's new John F. Kennedy Federal Building is a full 180 sq . ft. , cost $25,000 , and was simply titled by its painter , Robert Motherwell , New England Elegy . But it did not remain that for long . Up on the wall last week it became everyone 's Rorschach . Office workers began to see in the top black band the outlines of a gun stock . Then reports got around that the title was actually The Tragedy of President Kennedy 's Death . <P> Where did it all lead ? To the experts , of course . Shown a photograph of the painting , Boston Museum of Fine Arts Assistant Curator Thomas N. Maytham noting the massive angular shapes , suggested that " one black blotch may represent the profile of the President 's head , a very direct and specific depiction of the most brutal moment of the tragedy , when Kennedy was struck by the bullet . The lines near the ' pro file , ' " he said , " represent either the trajectory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one sense , " he concluded , " because it does n't try to walk around the issues . " Which was more than Maytham could claim when he later recanted , pleading ignorance of the actual title . <P> By that time , though , the only one who could n't see something in the painting was the artist himself . Fumed Motherwell : " The painting is totally abstract . It is not a picture of Kennedy 's death , but an elegy , which is an expression of grief for someone dead , like a requiem mass . " Motherwell should know . It is the 104th elegy that he has painted in the past 18 years , and nobody has ever admitted seeing anything in one before .
