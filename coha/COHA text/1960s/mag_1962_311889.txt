Jumbo has a lot of reasons to be a white elephant . To begin with , the show is based on a Broadway musical of the same name that lost money in 1935 and has n't been heard of since . What 's more , the story is set in a circus , a subject that unfailingly transforms a moviemaker 's grey matter into pink cotton candy . Furthermore , the picture has absolutely everything-Panavision , Metrocolor , stars galore , 200 animals , 2,000 extras , a $5,000,000 budget . Yet somehow in spite of , or because of , all the tanbark and trumpets , clowns and candy-butchers , high wires , low jinks and desperate little dogs that ca n't stop doing backward somersaults , Jumbo is a great big blubbery amiable polka-dotted elephant of a show , just the ticket for a holiday hoot with the wife and kiddies . <P> Onscreen as onstage , not the least of Jumbo 's pleasures is its plot , shamelessly snookered from Shakespeare . Romeo ( Stephen Boyd ) is a daring young man on a flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rider . A cruel fate divides them . His father ( Dean Jagger ) owns a circus , her father ( Jimmy Durante ) owns a circus-and the circuses are rivals . Romeo , sent incognito to swindle Juliet 's father , falls in love with the lass instead . Duty at first conquers love , but in the end schmalz conquers all . <P> Director Charles Walters has the sense to let all this seem exactly what it is : nonsense . He skillfully mingles cinemagic and circus-pocus , and he almost always gets the best out of his players-including Jumbo , portrayed with massive aplomb by an animal named Sydney , who wears a size 92 top hat and , in profile , looks rather like Durante . Day as usual is blindingly sunny , but in a circus the glare seems suitable . Boyd , for once , talks without sounding as if he were a species of Boyd that chews worms . And Martha Raye is hilarious as an unfortunate fortuneteller who sometimes plays a lion . But the show belongs to Schnoz . <P> At 69 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mere appendage of that incomparable proboscis , long may it wave . But age can not wither nor custom stale his infinite sameness . In 1962 he is essentially what he was in 1950 , when he made his last movie . He is Jimmy , a quite ordinary little fellow who looks slightly confused and absurdly belligerent , as though in total darkness he had stepped on the teeth of a rake , and the handle had popped up and hit him in the nose , and there he stands , punching wildly and wondering why he is n't hitting anybody . But as a comedian Jimmy is not in the least confused : he is the master of a style much subtler than it seems . Superficially , he is merely a matchless Mr. Malaprop - who but Jimmy could describe an elephant as a " pulchatoobinous pachadoim " and really seem to mean it ? But look deeper . His comedy is grounded in an innocence as perfect as a baby's-or a saint 's . Not since the late Harry Langdon of the silent days has the screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Top in broad daylight with a stolen elephant in tow , could throw up his hands and say with almost mystical fervor : " What elephant ? "
