txt " It may seem strange , " declared the businessman , " that so many of us West Germans take vacations in Communist lands , when it was Communists , after all , who took away part of our country . " But that is just the point . East of the Iron Curtain is the only place we can meet our relatives from East Germany . " He happened to be in Bucharest on business . But last Summer , the German told me , he and his wife had spent two weeks with their " eastern " relatives on Bulgaria 's Black Sea coast . Charms discovered This family was one of hundreds , perhaps thousands , of divided Gerrian families who every year plan their vacation trips to converge on Lake Balaton in Hungary , the mountain resorts of Romania , or the Black Sea beaches of Bulgaria . West German tourists lead the flood of Western tourists who are discovering Balkan charms . East Germans are allowed to travel more or less freely east of the Iron Curtain , except in Yugoslavia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Iron Curtain and the Berlin Wall . But problems also arise . Almost every day at least one East German citizen braves the scrutiny of Romanian police and enters the new West German Embassy in Bucharest to plead for asylum in the German Federal Republic . West German consuls listen sympatheti* // *Vacations reunite Germans // cally to such pleas  --  and say no . The unhappy East Germans go away , probably worse off than they were before , if their identity was checked by Communist police . To East German suppliants , the experience must be something of a disillusionment . They know of Bonn 's claim to represent all Germans , east and west of the Iron Curtain . Now West Germany has an embassy in Communist Romania , a country which East Germans are free to visit . What could be more natural than to try this route of escape from the German Democratic Republic , so much safer than the mine fields and barbed-wire fences that split Germany itself ? Yet the West German Government  --  which welcomes all East Germans who escape the hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Bucharest . If Bonn 's embassy were to be caught helping a single East German flee communism , West Germany would be finished in Eastern Europe . Hands off ' agreement Romania 's Communist rulers may act independently of Moscow , but they are tough dogmatists at home . West Germany had to agree explicitly , as part of its diplomatic deal with Bucharest , to keep hands off East Germans begging for asylum . More than one West German consul , strained by listening and saying no , day after day , has asked for transfer from Bucharest . Along with a rise in German tourism in the Balkans has come an increase in the number of Fliichtlingshelfer ? individual West German citizens who try to smuggle East Germans back to the Federal Republic . If caught , these West Germans are tried under the law of the Communist country where they made the attempt . Often their sentences are adjusted to the amount of time they have spent in jail awaiting trial . Kidnaping ' charged There have been two ugly , but somewhat murky , instances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West German citizens and deport them to East Germany . 1 . In September , 1966 , Bulgarian police arrested a German and sent him to East Germany . West German officials in Sofia protested that the man was a citizen of the Federal Republic . The Bulgarian Foreign Office asserted the arrested man had carried an East German passport . The case is in limbo . 2 . Earlier a woman from Minster , in West Germany , who had fled East Germany in 1960 , was arrested in Hungary by East German police and returned to East Germany . The significance of this incident was that Hungarian officials applied , on Hungarian soil , the East German nationality law passed by Walter Ulbricht 's regime . This law holds that any person living within East Germany at the time of its creation in 1949 remains an East German citizen , wherever he may reside . Under this interpretation , East German and Hungarian officials argued that the arrested woman , Miss Anne-Marie Derlig was subject to East German jurisdiction despite her residence in the Federal Republic . The West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly those who had escaped from East Germany , of the risk they ran in traveling to Communist lands . So far the incident has not been repeated . Yugoslavia has more West German tourists than any other Communist country ? an estimated 800,000 this year . East Germany also sends about 30,000 tourists to Yugoslavia . But there is no contact between them . Individual travel prohibited Mr. Ulbricht apparently does not trust the Yugoslays . East Germans do not get a passport to travel to Yugoslavia as individuals . Sometimes East German scientists invited to attend conferences in Yugoslavia are denied permission . Those East Germans who do go travel in closely guarded groups , sprinkled heavily with trusted Communists . They go to specified resorts , generally near the Albanian frontier . They move always in their groups . Free-wheeling Yugoslays make no secret of their contempt for a Communist government which shows so little confidence in the loyalty of its people .
