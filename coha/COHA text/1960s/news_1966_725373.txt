Prouty Discusses Over-70 Pension Plan To the Editor : In your editorial March 10 you called for scrapping the Prouty plan to provide Social Security benefits for all over 70 who are not otherwise eligible for Social Security . I take great issue with the allegation that my proposal is a perversion of the Social Security system . Medical care under Social Security brings those who never contributed a penny toward hospitalization under a program of benefits at age 65 . The transitional amendments of 1965 bring under Social Security those who contributed only a very small percentage toward the benefits they ultimately receive . My proposal is not a perversion but an extension of these existing principles and programs . Nor does my proposal merit the label " share - the - wealth scheme " you imposed , as under existing Social Security laws the beneficiaries of my proposal would be subject to the same earned income limitations imposed on present beneficiaries . Of the 1.5 million beneficiaries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of welfare program . My proposal attacks poverty in a class of people statistically identified as , man for man , woman for woman , the poorest in the United States . The vast majority are teachers , policemen , firemen , self - employed farmers and others who retired from their jobs before Social Security was applied to their employment . Their retirement income , if any , is often based on wages and salaries of the 1930 's and 1940 's . Many retired teachers , for example , receive as little as $25 a month and have never been permitted to contribute to or participate in the Social Security system . Your editorial was critical of funding my plan from general revenues . Research discloses that the Social Security Act of 1935 as amended in 1943 provided funding for certain programs out of . general revenues of the Treasury . The same principle is used under the Medicare Act to pay for health insurance for those age 65 who have made no contributions to the trust fund . Again my proposal utilizes an existing principle . Finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposal will diminish in number as Social Security coverage approaches universality . It is designed , therefore , to offer a minimum program of retirement benefits ( $33 a month ) to those age 70 and above who would not be eligible for Social Security , who have been denied the opportunity since 1935 to participate in the Social Security system . The Senate by its three separate votes in support of my proposal indicated that Congress is ready now to rectify an old wrong . To my mind this proposal is the only fair , equitable and just way to permit the needy aged to participate in the broadest floor of protection against want available in the world today . Your Senators Jacob Javits and Robert F. Kennedy should be commended for their support , as should the other Senators who three times voted to keep this amendment in the bill . WINSTON L. PROUTY U. S. Senator from Vermont Washington , March 10 , 196d sides ; they allowed assaults by hoodlums on club members and did nothing to protect those assaulted . To add insult to injury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into custody those truly responsible for the fracas . How can the police be expected to review their own actions when they exhibit such prejudiced behavior toward citizens of this city ? PHILIP SIEKEVITZ New York , March 7 , 1966 ? Commuter Rail Subsidy To the Editor : Mayor John V. Lindsay in his fireside chat of March 3 said that his tax proposals " happen to be the right thing and the fair thing to do . " Since he seeks the right and fair thing , may I urge that a share of those new tax revenues be used to subsidize the commuter railroads . A ridiculous proposal , of course , but his refusal to raise the subway fare means a share of the new tax dollars from the out-of-town commuter will be used to subsidize the subways , no matter what he labels those dollars for , and the benefit will run to a segment of the commuters , not all . To be " right and fair , " Lindsay need merely match those support dollars for the subways with similar grants to the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RODERICK M. MACDOUGALL Wilton , Conn. , March 4 , 1966 ? Powers of Mayor 's Deputy To the Editor : The opinion expressed in your March 2 editorial " City Administrator 's Role " conflicts with my opinion on the same subject . I take issue also with that part of the Ford-financed " study " that recommends amendment of the New York City Charter in order to express statutorily the powers and duties of the City Administrator . I have learned through experience as a legislative draftsman the dangers inherent in freezing the powers and duties of governmental officials in inflexible , difficult-to-change statutory language . Creation of Bureaus Section 3 of the 1961 Charter empowers the Mayor , as " the chief executive officer of the city , " by " executive order , at any time , to create or abolish bureaus , divisions or positions within his executive office as he may deem necessary to fulfill his duties . " He may from time to time , by executive order , delegate to or withdraw from any member of said office specified functions , powers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or resolutions of the Council or to appoint or remove officials . " The report of Dr. D. Caraley , who made the " study , " recommends that the powers of the City Administrator be frozen into the Charter in detailed , specific language . In part , he states also , that " New Yorkers looked to the Mayor to represent them and operate the city government . " And so did the 1961 New York City Charter Revision Commission who , in that belief , directed me as counsel to write into the new Charter more power and authority for the Mayor ? more power and authority , incidentally , than that possessed by any of his predecessors or , for that matter , by any Mayor of any other American city . The Charter revisers intended to leave the Mayer free " from time to time . . . to delegate " to either of the Deputy Mayors powers and duties as experience and changed conditions required and as the Mayor deemed necessary to fulfill his duties . I agree wholeheartedly with Dr. Caraley when he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " will have the intelligence , courage and discretion hi his executive order to clothe one or both of his deputies with necessary power and authority to cope with conditions as these arise and to follow up his order with any necessary supervision . The Mayor 's power to make executive orders pursuant to Section 3 of the Charter is a flexible one , subject to swift and necessary changes . It was so intended to be for the reasons I have here stated . REUBEN A. LAZARUS New York , March 3 , 1966 The writer was counsel to the Charter Revision Commission of New York City . ? Guatemala 's Military Rule To the Editor : Richard Eder deserves both praise and gratitude for his unbiased news article Feb. 23 " Free Vote on Guatemalans , " in which he reviews the present conditions of my country and the possibilities Guatemalans have to re-establish the rule of law , within the framework of democratic institutions . For two years I have pointed out that Col. Enrique Peralta , Guatemala 's dictator , was leading the nation and the armed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guatemalans were enslaved by the most reactionary and sterile type of militarism , and that Peralta wished his regime to continue through a Presidential candidate of his own choosing . This is about to happen in my country , with the most serious consequences for all concerned . I wish to point out two facts about the article . One is the undisputable fact that the constitutional and democratic regime of Miguel Ydigores Fuentes , overthrown by the Peralta clique on March 31 , 1963 , was progressive in nature and liberal in outlook . It was not perfect , but it shines as one which respected human rights and fundamental freedoms , which started the industrialization of Guatemala , and which gave great , if not basic , impetus to the Central American Common Market . Promise of Free Elections The other is that the attempted coup of last December did not try to cancel the March 6 elections , but rather to replace Peralta as Minister of Defense and , therefore , to insure free elections . Foreign representatives dissuaded the officers from staging the coup because assurances were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peralta will not guarantee free elections does n't surprise me , for he is deceitful and treacherous . Those who backed the 1963 coup have only to blame themselves for their present predicament . ROBERTO ALEJOS Former Guatemalan Presidential candidate in exile Paris , Feb. 28 , 1966 ? Stock Seller To the Editor : I am amused at the weeping and wailing of the New York Stock Exchange because of Mayor Lindsay 's plan to in. crease the state tax on the sale of stock from 4 cents a share ( on shares over $20 ) to 6 cents a share . Last year the seller , not the Stock Exchange , paid 8 cents a share-4 cents state and 4 cents Federal and the New York Stock Exchange did not move to New Jersey , Bermuda or Vietnam . Editorial March 5 . This year , under Mayor Lindsay 's plan , the cost to the seller of stock will be $6 on 100 shares instead of $8 . Who is trying to kid whom ? JOHN E. BOOTH New York , March 7 , 1966 ? Phone Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schwab 's Feb. 19 view that it is completely unnecessary for telephone company information operators to announce their names . However , allow me to express my utter surprise and dissension with Mr Schwab 's unwarranted attack on the efficiency of the telephone information service . The courtesy and promptness of the employes are the envy of any foreign visitor here . This applies both to local and long - distance information . Contrary to the detractor of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company , service in all its complicated phases has improved considerably in the last ten years , and wherever , possible it is being improved daily . In fact , it is undoubtedly the finest in the world . I have no ax to grind for the company , but let us give credit where it is due . Why does not Mr. Schwab reserve his gripes for the Post Office Department , among others , where so much has to be done to bring service up to the standards of some other countries ?
