 | Our Amazing Underground Missile Bases MOTORISTS traveling a peaceful country road a few miles east of Denver recently rubbed their eyes in wonder . The scene was right out of the Arabian Nights . A weed-fringed mound deep in an adjacent field stirred with the rumble of aoo-ton doors , and an enormous pencil of frosty metal rose silently out of the earth . Other hidden doors opened nearby , and two great shining globes appeared . Men , dwarfed by these genies , could be seen hurrying to their posts . After a long moment , the scene vanished as abruptly as it had been coked . The metallic giants , re , ponding to the command of an unseen Aladdin , returned silently into the earth ; the men disappeared ; the prairie was as empty as before . There was nothing to show that deep underground were six vast fortresses , each , housing three Titan intercontinental ballistic missiles armed with multi-megaton nuclear warheads . There was no sign that deep in the earth teams of missilemen , whose warning antennas stretch around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unstoppable , all-or-nothing defenses against danger that lay half a world away . A network of such buried forts is being built across the United States . It is the largest construction project  | in all history , and it represents a potent addition to the nation 's defenses . The giant missiles emplaced underground in steel-and-concrete silos are designed to ride out an attack , then rise to the surface . They can hurl destructive power equal to millions of tons of TNT squarely on targets continents away , in minutes . On a recent 3000-mile tour I saw the new missile bases in all stages of construction . The Titan the motorists glimpsed in setting-up exercises belonged to the 451st Ballistic Missile Wing at Lowry Air Force Base in Colorado . The 451st , with a total of i8 Titans , is the first to go underground , and its base is the prototype of the many others that are following . In a temporary office crammed with blueprints , Col. J. H. Thompson , hard-driving coordinator on the Lowry job , first showed me a six-foot plaster scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two great domed rooms ? the command post and the powerhouse . From them tunnels branched off to three deep and widely-separated launching silos . In these silos , under reinforced-concrete blast doors , the Titans stand , each 98 feet tall , each poised on a tremendous elevator . " We have six such complexes scattered over a 7o-square-mile area , " Colonel Thompson said , pointing out red blocks on a map . " They 're hardened to take anything but an unlikely direct nuclear hit . Let 's get the helicopter and take look . " Seen from the air , this part the Lowry base is an empty cou try of treeless mounds and erode gullies . The area above Complex . 1-A came into view as the helico ter beat its way over a low rise , b there was little to see . Smooth reddirt covered everything ; the two 100-foot , shining hemispheres th house radar antennas , the three huge silos and the quarter-ml main connecting tunnel were safel underground . We landed in a gale of our ow dust ; a helmeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stair and through a bla lock . Now we were in a fortress fantastic as the outposts astronau hope to build on the moon ? pushbutton blockhouse on a stran ? frontier . The air-conditioned three-missile complex is a community in itsel insulated from surface shocks by massive pre-stressed reinforced-con crete roof covered by 65 feet o earth . The command center and it mess hall , dormitory and recreatio room for the 11-man crew , i. " shock-mounted . " The entire installation ? including the Titans , the steel cages that enclose them , their elevators , and the whole array o ground-support equipment ? hang from tremendous coil springs , two feet in diameter and 40 feet long . It is as if a I5-story building were suspended in air . There are no openings to the surOUR AMAZING UNDERGROUND MISSILE BASES 87  | face . except the massive silo doors nd some hidden escape hatches for e crew . Enough air , water , food and fuel are stored to enable the Complex to survive a nuclear attack and retaliate . From each missile silo round tunnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vault doors and then several hundred feet to the launch-control center . As we entered the center of Complex 1-A , our footsteps seemed loud move the muted click and hum of he neat gray computers and " sequencers " that dominate the big cirular room . Three airmen were busy at consoles under an array of locks . Men ca n't think fast enough to fire a ballistic missile , our guide said . The crucial commands during a launching are given by computers . The ICBM is perhaps the most marvelous ? as well as the most deadly ? achievement of technology . The 110-ton giant must rise on a thunderous blowtorch of flame , accelerate at precisely the right rate in precisely the right direction to flash through a tight , imaginary hoop on the edge of space . The powered and guided portion of the flight takes four minutes . From then on the warhead coasts up in a great ballistic arc that crests about 600 miles above the turning earth , noses over to re-enter the atmosphere at 25 times the speed of sound ( about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vaporize an enemy missile base , an airfield or a city . Although a launching will take only a few minutes and may never come , the men in a complex are endlessly busy . Their one job is to keep themselves and the Titan ready for action if the President  | ever orders it fired ? and only he can . All components in the vast array of hydraulic , pneumatic and electric devices that activate the systems within the missile must be tested and maintained to a degree previously unheard of . There are thousands of things that can go wrong , and even a tiny defect can cripple " the beast . " Repairs are made on a " black box " basis . A faulty component is replaced with a " quick-change module " ? just as your auto dealer replaces a fuel pump ? and the old one goes back to the factory . Occasionally , a missile crew is flown to Vandenberg Air Force Base to help launch a test vehicle or a space probe . It 's good training . But missiles are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead , the crew perfects the tight teamwork needed to fuel and launch a Titan by constantly running through simulated firing drills . I watched such a drill . The operations officer at the main console flips through the pages of his long check list , confirming each item by light signals . A closed-circuit television screen high on the wall ahead gives him a running close-up of action on the launching pad . Lox ( liquid oxygen ) and fuel from pressurized storage are hurled into tanks in each stage of the missile . And his colleagues at their consoles alongside come in with final " go/no-go " reports from instruments on the launcher : " Missile power . . . Go , " . . . " RF systems ... Go , " . . . " Propulsion . . . Go . Then the blast doors far abo open and the elevator hoists th Titan , umbilical lines and all , iC feet to the surface .

One minut more and the Titan could blast o on the only flight it will ever mak a five-million-dollar vehicle on half-hour , one-way trip that coul hold the destiny of the world . This is only an exercise . You kno nothing will happen , but it is breath-taking thing to watch . The isolation of the buried ml sile fortresses makes it difficult t. realize that each is linked by multi ple circuits with all the other and that the entire system i equipped with sensors that exten. around the planet , alert for dange signs outside the range of human senses . Missile sites are placed at least 18 miles apart so that even a direct hit would knock out only one . Wide dispersal creates communications and supply problems . To visit all nine silos in one western base , for example , requires Boo miles of travel by helicopter or 1140 miles by road . Special telephone lines link each silo , to its base , to SAC headquarters in Omaha and to the Pentagon . Preliminary work on the missile bases was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Titan and Minuteman ? existed . This is " concurren- cy , " starting many projects simultaneously instead of in sequence . The first Atlases to become operational are still in the open ? and vulnerable to attack . The next are in horizontal " coffin " type concrete Loxes with launchers which raise hem to vertical for firing . The latest models are going into silos like the Titans ' . All Atlas squadrons , with a total of 142 missiles , should he combat ready by early 1962 . A total of 14 Titan squadrons with 140 individual ICBM 's are being formed . Of these , the first seven squadrons will be identical with the Lowry complexes , but the others will take Titan II , an advanced model that will be capable of firing directly from the bottom of the silo , without first being hoisted up . The first big squadron of Minutemen , our " second-generation , " solid-fuel ICBM , will be operational by 1963 . It will he followed immediately by more squadrons , all in hardened underground sites . In the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 6o feet in the ground . For Minuteman can be stored unattended and fired by remote control in salvos ? seconds after a command is given . Later models may be placed on special missile trains which will rove rail lines in a random pattern to increase an enemy 's targeting problem . Every intercontinental missile on duty in the United States , and every  | intermediate-range missile abroad or in a Polaris submarine at sea , has its assigned target and specific instructions on how to reach it . But nobody in a base or submarine knows the location of his missile 's target . No one man has all the information needed to fire a nuclear missile . Several men have bits , but all the bits must be jig-sawed together , and Presidential orders be verified and re-verified before a Titan can be launched . There is no margin for error . A test vehicle can be destroyed by the range safety officer , but an operational ICBM , once launched , can not be destroyed or recalled . A few underground ICBM bases are east of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South and West . Their locations can not be concealed . At least 100,000 men are working at the 20 sprawling sites , and thousands more are involved in other phases of the job ? from buying land and finding water to building reinforced access roads . The sites are closely guarded against sabotage , of course , but nobody has any illusion of secrecy . As each complex nears completion , people in remote towns with names like Deertrail , Sugarbush , Wamego and Chugwater begin uneasily to feel themselves spotlighted as targets , their homes suddenly on the front line facing the awesome artillery of the space age . " We know the government has to put them somewhere , " an Arkansas farmer said , " but we wish they was somewhere else . If things bust loose , we 'll be just as much on the front line here in Springhill as they are in Berlin . " The conscientious , morally-accountable men in charge of the missiles feel to the depths of their souls the weight of their tragic responsibility . Better than anyone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President should ever be obliged by enemy action to say the fateful secret words into his " gold " telephone . They know that a mistaken shot could mean the end of civilization for eons , perhaps the final night . Proud as they are of their prodigious " beasts , " their private prayers that no member of the human race will ever fire an ICBM in anger are as fervent as yours or mine . @#
