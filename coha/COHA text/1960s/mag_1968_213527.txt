Huey P. Newton , the handsome , light-skinned leader of the hypermilitant Black Panther Party for Self-Defense , stood impassively as the sentence was handed down . He had been convicted of manslaughter in the shooting of an Oakland , Calif. , patrolman during a wild gun battle in October 1967 , which left another policeman injured and Newton grievously wounded with a bullet through his stomach . It was one of the acts of war between police and Panthers that have bloodied the streets of Oakland for almost two years . Now , as Newton 's black-uniformed followers looked on in silent anger , Alameda County Judge Monroe Friedman ordered him imprisoned for two to 15 years . Friedman denied a motion to free Newton on bail , glanced only cursorily at a 15-inch stack of petitions signed by 29,301 people testifying to Huey 's character as " an honest , dedicated , loyal and selfless human being . " <P> During the trial , Newton 's Panthers promised violent vengeance if he were convicted . Lengthy appeals planned by Defense Attorney Charles Garry , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newton , 26 , was manacled and driven 45 miles to a reception center at Vacaville for eventual transfer to another prison , possibly San Quentin . <P> Abrasive Eloquence . Another Panther was having his problems with the law last week . The Panthers ' " minister of information , " Author Eldridge Cleaver ( Soul on Ice ) , was ordered back to prison for violating his parole from an assault conviction . Cleaver became involved last April in a firefight during which the Panthers ' 17-year-old treasurer was shot by Oakland policemen . Cleaver himself was wounded . As a result , his parole was revoked , and he was accused of assault with intent to commit murder . A lower court later freed him , ruling that Cleaver was being held because of his extremist political opinions . Last week , however , the California Court of Appeals reversed that ruling , granting Cleaver 60 days at liberty for appeals . <P> For Cleaver , a jail-educated militant of abrasive eloquence , the court order for his imprisonment comes at an embarrassing moment . He is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is also scheduled to appear as a guest lecturer at the University of California 's Berkeley campus , an appointment that stirred angry protests from the state 's political establishment . For the Panthers , with two of their leaders on ice , it was a time of barely throttled fury .
