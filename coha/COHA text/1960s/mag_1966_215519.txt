For three years , Hertz Corp. , the No. 1 company in the U.S. car-rental field , stood stolidly by while Avis Inc. , No. 2 , successfully needled away with its " We try harder " advertising campaign . But no longer . Now Hertz , having changed ad agencies , is trying to turn Avis ' own theme against it . Typical of the new Hertz ads : " For years , Avis has been telling you Hertz is No. 1 . Now we 're going to tell you why . " <P> Why did Hertz take so long to hit back ? Carl Ally , 42 , head of a four-year-old agency that bears his name and now holds the Hertz account , explains the delay this way : " If a little guy comes up to you on the street and tugs at your coat and you swat him , everybody will say , ' You should n't have done that . ' But if you walk on for 14 blocks and he keeps tugging , then people think you 're justified to punch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punch has already received a response from Avis . As written by Doyle Dane Bernbach , the latest Avis ad reads in part : " They 've come out with a get-tough-with-Avis campaign . Why ? " Avis suggests that it is " because No. 1 's share of the rent a car business is getting smaller , " cites a drop from 56% to 50% in Hertz 's share of the market in 26 key places since the original Avis campaign began . Another reason is that Ally , a fighter pilot in World War II and the Korean War , does not mind a good scrap-even with a mogul like William Bernbach , the creative boss at Doyle Dane who thought up the dramatically successful Avis campaign . <P> When Hertz gave its $7,500,000 account to the agency , the new strategy was almost immediately apparent to Ally . " Up to then , " he says , " this had been a one-sided dialogue . " Along with turning it into an argument , Ally also set out to see whether Avis ' innuendoes-that Hertz had dirty ashtrays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inspection trip , he toured airports , where most car rentals take place . At each stop , Ally says , he prowled through parking lots of both companies , emptying ashtrays into paper bags . " There was n't an awful lot of difference , " he says wryly . " We lost in Tulsa , for instance , by one butt . But in Amarillo they had two more cigarettes and a half-eaten taco . " <P> <P> Eyeball to Eyeball . Ally 's returning ads partly spoof those for Avis by Doyle Dane , partly press Hertz prowess . One television commercial , for instance , shows a " We try harder " balloon deflating slowly while a voice ticks off Hertz 's advantages in available cars , widespread locations and electronic reservation service . Another agrees that Avis ' " only No. 2 " claim is " hard to argue with . " Ally , a teaching fellow in English at the University of Michigan before he turned to ad writing , proudly produced another that asks : " No. 2 says he tries harder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
