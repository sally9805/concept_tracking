Letters ' PEACE HOSTAGES ' TO THE EDITOR Arthur Herzog 's informative article on the peace movements ( " Inquiry Into the Peace Movement , " May 19 ) could not obviously list or describe all of the various peace plans which have been advanced . One project , however  --  the " Peace Hostages " plan  --  does not fall into any of the author 's categories and deserves mention . Its original concept envisages the mass exchange between the United States and the Soviets of people in comparable walks of life . A volunteer for the plan pledges to spend a year in the Soviet Union , provided his Soviet counterpart agrees to do the same here and provided the immediate kin of high Government officials from both countries are also exchanged . Lucius R. BOLEY . New York . The author comments : " Hostages for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an example of various citizens ' initiatives that have been proposed . It is not official policy , although it has had the support of Eleanor Roosevelt and Senators Javits and Humphrey . Mr , James ' notion is to dramatize what he feels to be the existing situation  --  that populations of both countries are nuclear hostages already ? in order to establish better communication between Russians and Americans and to weaken the grip of the nation state in favor of free movement of people . Among the ' hostages ' who have already offered themselves are Governor Rockefeller 's daughter and son-in-law . Critics of the proposal feel that it is simply naive ; proponents believe it is just this sort of inspired act that is needed in the present international situation . " NO PARKING TO THE EDITOR : Ely Jacques Kahn 's article " Needed : Oases in the Asphalt Desert " ( May 26 ) hit the nail right on the head . New York City abounds with cases of lack of courage and imagination in planning park recreation areas . Case in point : Mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brooklyn are becoming car graveyards . The areas under the elevated highway approaches to the bridge are now being used as parking places for cars , repair centers for Do-ItYourself auto mechanics , garbage dumps , etc . In the meantime , the children living along the path of the elevated highway are seeking places to play . A little imagination could convert this tremendous expanse of land into small play areas with benches , etc. , where adults and children could rest and play in safety . CHARLES BING-DONS . New York . VALUE OF RESEARCH TO THE EDITOR : Lawrence Galton 's article " Will Space Research Pay Off on Earth ? " ( May 26 ) has stated some of the questions concerned with space research , but has contributed little to the understanding of the situation . Neither I , nor most of my colleagues , have been under the impression that space research could find widespread applications in civilian products . In hardware development for space use , cost of production and efficiency of operation are often secondary considerations to compactness and reliability under conditions not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ render , in general , any discoveries unfit for exploitation on earth . It would be wrong , though , to surmise that the national economy is not benefiting . The scientific community is prospering , and so are several new and old companies that pay taxes and employ people . The vast Government effort in research has given the research scientist freedom in choosing his employment . I would say that three factors , in any order , are most important in determining a scientist 's choice : professional advancement , economic inducements and nature of work . In years past , when productminded companies were the major employers of research scientists and engineers , a man would consider himself fortunate to occupy a research position . Times have changed and so has the character of the research scientist . MAURICE E. LEVY . Mineola , N. Y. ENGINEERS ' EFFORT TO THE EDITOR : Lawrence Galton marred an otherwise perceptive and accurate article in failing to observe that the space effort is essentially an engineering endeavor , not a scientific one , and that engineering lies at the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To ignore engineering 's significance in our space activi ( // Letters // ties is a disservice to this historic and great profession . STANLEY KLEIN , Assistant Secretary , Engineering Joint Council . New York . The author replies : " I certainly meant to do no disservice to the engineering profession . I fully agree that it is performing a major function in the space effort and that the work of engineers not only in that area but in many others is not fully appreciated . " PIC'TIIRE TO THE EDITOR : I received the shock of my life when I saw , in the article " The Ship of State Rocks Hyannis Port souvenirs . Hyannis Port " by Richard P. Hunt ( May 26 ) , a photograph caption reading " ... and a portrait flanked by souvenir banners and pitchers ( italics mine ) in the local 5-and-10 . " Oh , dear ! Just because 99.99 per cent of the people say it that way , does The Times have to print the word " pictures " that way ? RUTI1 BUSCH , Mahopac , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but there are pitchers on the pitchers ( see above ) . ? Editor . JUDGING PROFESSORS TO THE EDITOR : I feel that there are many valuable suggestions in John G. Kemeny 's article , " Once the Professor Was a Teacher . . . " ( June 2 ) . However , it is my opinion that , to a large extent , the dilemma faced by the universities , i.e. , too many professors in the labs or libraries and not in the classrooms , is one of their own making . I believe that the dictum " publish or perish " preceded the mass distribution of postdoctoral fellowships . In many of our best-known universities at the time for promotion the aspiring professor is judged on the basis of his research and only secondarily on the basis of his teaching . In these same universities the decision regarding promotion lies largely with the senior faculty . Therefore , it appears that the faculty " establishment , " and not the National Science Foundation or the university administrations , are at least in part responsible for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dayton , Ohio
