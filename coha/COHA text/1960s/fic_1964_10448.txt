bits of information about one thing or another , and , in this sort of way , you got more confidence in yourself . You watched women , and overheard things they said and you saw how they acted and you came to feel that you were as good as they were and that you could get along just as well as they did , or even better if you were out with successful men and the rest of it . All of this would be useful to her if she went to Chicago or even if she stayed on here in Valley City . Fed up though she was with Erdman 's , she knew that she was getting some advantages for herself in the future . Besides , she might meet someone at Erdman 's . She did n't count on this or daydream about it as if her name was Cinderella Anne Duncan , but it might happen , and it could . There were girls who were better-looking than she was , but she knew that she had looks enough and plenty of sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of men figured anybody who was a waitress was an easy lay . And even if you were n't , they looked down on you . They figured girls from good families did n't take jobs as a hash-slinger . A girl was only supposed to become a hash-slinger because she could n't get anything better . Anne had had her share of hoity-toity girls at parties acting superior when they knew she was a waitress . The hell with them , though . Anne knew she had her reasons . She had been working six days a week , and going out many nights to movies when she did n't have dates or did n't go dancing . She thought she was having fun , enough to make up , in a way , for everything she did n't like about her work . Usually , she did n't leave for work until eleven , and there were things to do at home , like washing her stockings and underthings , and ironing and pressing her dresses , mending and sewing , washing her hair , lots of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her home . Since it was clean , she was not ashamed to have fellows calling for her on dates , even though she might wish , sometimes , that it was better-looking and did n't maybe give the impression that she was a girl from a family without any means . But it did n't bother her seriously . All that she meant was the place could be a little more up to date . But then , if any fellow did n't like her home , he did n't have to take her out . They had to want her company and herself as she was , and not want to date her because there was a baby grand piano , or an expensive new Victrola , maybe , or even one of those new loudspeakingradios , or a fancy new rug , Oriental or Persian , or newp101Morris chairs , or furniture from this period , or the other period , or imitations of antiques , the kind of chairs that lords and ladies and hoity-toities needed for their covered-up asses . A fellow would n't find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't that too bad ? But Anne did not believe that there was much anger in herself . She got along with most people . She was usually liked . She was asked for dates frequently . She had friends but no really close ones . And though she felt a need for safety , and set up limits that she would n't let fellows pass , she had her own desires . And she had her troubled feelings and fears about social and personal inferiority , like being afraid her taste in clothes might not be good . But Anne felt she got more satisfaction than dissatisfaction out of life . She lived with a vague belief or assumption that somehow , one clay , or at some time ahead in the future , when she would still be young , she would become a very happy person . She would be loved and understood . All of her virtues and good qualities would be recognized . The real , and the true Anne Duncan would be known . Others would see Anne Duncan as she saw herself . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen.  |p102Anne  spent some time thinking of practical things she could do while convalescing . Some of these , such as airing her clothes and shoes , and cleaning out and rearranging her closet , would have to wait until her ankle was almost back to normal . Others she could do immediately , like sewing and mending . She would get a pattern , and make herself a dress out of some lovely gray silk material her sister had bought her . She would even buy some print goods and make one or two more dresses . She did not sew very well . But she could learn to sew better , and make dresses for herself , and nice things . Her mother could help her , too . And she could knit and crochet . She was n't too good , but that was because she had never knitted and crocheted much , and with practice she would easily improve . She 'd knit herself a sweater , and a wool scarf and also one of each for her mother . She might knit a pair of socks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's kids . Then there were those two old rayon and cotton dresses that needed altering . They had to be taken up an inch or two at the hem . And she could write some letters , a long one to her brother , one to her sister , and a letter to Abby Baker who had gone with her family to California about two years ago . Gosh , she and Abby had been such good friends . She guessed Abby had been just about the best friend she 'd ever had . Gosh , how they would talk and laugh , especially about fellows . They 'd told each other their secrets , too . She certainly did owe a letter to Abby , and , gee , what wouldn'tp103she give to see Abby now ? Abby wanted her to go to California . So why did n't she go ? Anne let this question trail off , undecided , but she was kind of dreamy about it . She did not know . Maybe she ought to read a little . She could ask her mother to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rental library at Wolton 's Drug Store . That novel , Main Street , she 'd heard someone say something about it , and she wanted to read it . Maybe if she read some books or stories in magazines , it would help the time to pass . However , Anne did not start in on any of these things . She just sat around , dreaming . On the second afternoon , Zeke telephoned ; he explained that he had n't called sooner because he knew she 'd be laid up and he did n't want to have to make her come to the phone on that bum dog of hers , especially he did n't , no kidding either , because of his knowing how mean a bad ankle could be , because once , when he was a kid , he had twisted his left ankle , playing football . It was when he was about twelve . His foot went zooey in a hole . But he guessed that he 'd told her that the other night . He was only reminding her , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and how he understood . And he also had phoned so that he could tell her he 'd like to see her . Anne invited him over . Zeke said he was just doggoned sorry , because he could n't make it that night , because a couple of cousins were coming to the house . They were only relations , first cousins , no , second cousins , but he was stuck with them . The thing was that he had promised his mother on a stack of Bibles . But he 'd ring up Anne the next day and maybe see her , if he did n't have some business to look after for his father . But " absitively , " he 'd be over first chance and as soon as he could . Maybe , too , he 'd take her for a little spin in the Chalmers as soon as she was able to go for a ride . ' What he did want her to know was this : he was mighty glad she was getting better.  |p104But  then , unexpectedly , insinuation came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other night ? " " Yes , " she said . " Only a little , though . " " What 'd you think ? " His voice sounded as though he were leering at the other end . " Zeke , this is a party line we 're on . " After a pause , Anne asked : " Have you been thinking about it  --  the other night ? " " Yeah , sure I have , I already said that . Listen , when can I see you and take you out for a spin ? " " Oh , I do n't think I 'd be too comfortable in an automobile . " " Why ? ' Why not ? " Zeke asked . Anne could hear him breathing , as though he were crouched over the phone . " Your foot ? " " Yes , " she said . " It 's my foot . " But her voice seemed to imply that there were other reasons . She guessed that Zeke was disappointed by her tone , but she wanted to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that because of what had almost happened in the gravel yard , he could take for granted he damned well could go further with her . " Listen , I only meant for a little spin , a little ride . I did n't mean that I meant , you know , any more than I meant . " She thought he sounded suddenly and pathetically earnest . " I figure you got nothing to do but sit around home with nothing to do , and I figure a little spin might give you a change from , you know , twiddling your thumbs . " " Thanks , " said Anne . " I really do thank you , but I think I 'm going to have to wait until I can sit more comfortable in an automobile . It 's not all that dull , really , I mean , you 're liable to think it 's duller than it is except that you do n't know how much I 'm enjoying this rest I 'm getting . Besides , I 'm doing things . I 'm sewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and later on some friends are coming to pay me a visit . I 'm making the best of a bad ankle . " " Well , I guess women are different ; you can always keep busy at home , even with a strained ankle . " " Sprained , " Anne corrected . Zeke paused . " What 'd I say ? " " You said ' strained . ' " " Did I ? Well I meant sprained . The thing is , I once had this sprained ankle . . . " He had lost the thread . " Oh . The thing is , with women it 's different . You give a woman a sprained ankle and she can always find something to do at home , but a man , he 's twiddlingp105his thumbs inside of five minutes . Listen , when can I see you ? You got to watch that ankle and , you know , do n't do anything to set you back on it . Let it get better . Do n't forget it 's your ankle and all " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too pretty a rosebud not to be in your rosiest bloom . " " Oh , thank you , Mr. Daniels . " Her tone was teasing , almost sarcastic . Zeke was silent . He was at a loss for what to say . Then , he sneezed a few times . When he stopped sneezing , he said : " Well , I 'd like to say more , and to pass more compliments , Anne , but I guess it 's not the time and the circumstances because you ca n't have a party on a party line , can you ? " " Oh , you can have a party on a party line , " Anne said , " but you might have a gallery . " Zeke said yes , and that he would call her next day , and for her to rest her ankle good , and get it back to shipshape . He said good-bye . Anne said good-bye . Anne had wanted that call . She had already been disturbed becauseZeke had n't telephoned the very next day to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since it was while necking with him that she 'd wrenched the thing . She had been brooding about him , and about herself with him . Sometimes she felt ashamed because she had been burning up for him to do it to her , do anything he wanted with her . She 'd been afraid Zeke would now hold her in contempt . Fellows did look down on any girl that they knew as an easy lay . But that was only part of what she 'd felt . She 'd wanted , all right , she sure had . Zeke had something male that got her . That is , maybe it did . She did n't know . She thought so , that he did have it , and she wanted it , him . Maybe she was in love with him . And then the phone had rung and she had been that way with him  --  cold , sort of , and distant . When the conversation was ended , and she hopped away from the telephone , she knew why she had been cool to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of her , and what he was like . Because , no , she was n't sure that she loved him.  |p106But  she was not certain that she did n't love him . And at least , she did know that he must have some magnetic sex appeal . She got excited , and , kind of hot , too , remembering herself in Zeke 's arms . She must be , she was drawn to him . But she was just as much afraid of him , afraid of his physical attraction . She remembered the warning voice inside of herself , saying " Do n't " and " No . " Her instinct , or intuition , or a kind of sixth sense , it told her that Zeke was wrong . But she was still a virgin , and she could n't be certain that she was n't hesitating and blowing hot and cold because she was afraid of letting her cherry be lost . Maybe she was fighting herself , and mixing herself up . Maybe she was acting the way all girls did when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their virginity . Some girls had told her that they had n't been afraid and they loved it , even the first time when they were hurt , but maybe they had merely been talking and did n't want to admit the truth . And maybe she was afraid because of the way she 'd been brought up , with all that she had heard about the sinfulness and the shame , and the ruination which would be the lot of any woman who sinned by giving herself when she was n't married . It was all right for men but not women . That was what many thought , what perhaps almost everybodythought . Her mother blamed it all on the beast in man . They would lower women to the likes of animals , because of the beast in themselves . Men might enjoy doing it , but not women . That was n't fair . But maybe it was n't so . All Anne knew was that she felt such a physical excitement and hunger for Zeke , why she had just wanted and wanted like mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , do anything he wanted with her . But still there was that sixth sense warning against Zeke , a feeling that it would be bad , wrong , threatening to her if she gave way to him , and to herself . She knew that it was herself as well as Zeke . Her own desires could sweep everything else out of her mind ; they could leave her without will , unable to control herself . And she knew she wanted this to happen ; and , given the chance , she would n't only allow it to happen , she 'd help make it happen . Or would she ? The trouble was , this warning of her sixth sense , the voice of " No " and " Do n't " seemed like expression of her own true feelings . She did n't think it was a fear of sinning . She believed that she must be telling herself that Zeke was wrong for her . If he happened to be somebody else , or if she just met and wanted somebodyp107else , she would not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder of the very few moments on the steps before her front door when Zeke had been helping her , and he had seemed to her so strong and protective , but even this memory was not enough to overcome the warning of her supposed sixth sense.  |p108She  hopped slowly out to the front porch , and sat down in the rockingchair with the seat of thin , tan-colored pillows so worn that they looked like sacks . Her ankle was hurting again , the pain was eating at her , gnawing . Dr. Wyatt had come , and said it looked all right , and he 'd bound it and taped it again . At one minute , she thought she 'd die when he was cutting off the other bandage . Now it was just , oh , it hurt . But her ankle had saved her . Or had it ? Anne looked out from the porch , through the sun and the shadow cast by the big oak tree on the side of the small front yard . The day had been lovely . It still was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some time had passed . That much was accomplished , and Anne 's ankle was that much mended . The ankle that saved her from going to Hell lying on her back . Mrs. Cartwright , who lived a half block down on the left , was passing , and Johnny , her little boy , four or five , appeared in sight from behind his mother , running , and yelling in a shrieky voice : " I 'm a bird ! I 'm a bird ! I 'm a bird ! " " Mind , Johnny , or you 'll fall down and cut your knee and dirty up your clothes . " " I 'm a bird ! I 'm a bird ! I 'm a bird ! " " Mind you and quit running like a wild Indian . " Mrs. Cartwright was a short woman in her thirties , thirty-five or younger . Anne noticed that she had gone from plump to fat . Before her first kid , Johnny , was born , she had been slender , and pretty.  |p109Anne  used to watch her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she dressed up and went out or went to the store . Dresses had been longer then , and Mrs. Cartwright used to wear a blue suit , blue serge Anne guessed , which reached about halfwaydown to her ankles , and a white lace blouse with lots of ruffles , and Anne thought it always had looked so pretty , stiff with starch and so white and clean against the blue coat . The V collar made her look like a doll with her little round face . And she used to wear a gray knitted woolen dress . Her husband owned a little dry-goods store , and she often used to work in it until she got pregnant . There had been a lot of talk of scandal and a lot of criticism of Mrs. Cartwright , because she had got her hair bobbed like Clara Bow and had started smoking cigarettes . Anne remembered hearing how people were sorry for poor Mr. Cartwright , married to a little snip who cut up like some chorus girl might , who got her hair bobbed because she was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after her and make oogle eyes . And she smoked cigarettes , and this was a disgrace , and she did it just to shock decent people . Yes , and she was a wild one whose husband had better keep a close eye and watch on her . Some days , she minded the dry-goods store alone while Mr. Cartwright went to buy stock at a wholesaler 's or to do something , and there was no telling what goings-on there might be in the back room of that dry-goods store . Anybody could tell when she walked down the street that she had a siren 's eye and if she was n't man crazy , then appearances were one mighty big deception . When she got pregnant , there had been some suspicion that Mr. Cartwright had been deceived , but it served him right , the women said , if he became a laughingstock and supported a shameless wife and another man 's child . He let her smoke cigarettes , did n't he , and make eyes at every man in sight ? She could have carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have known about it , and he 'd never say a word to her . She had him tied around her finger like a piece of string . One of the women , Anne could n't remember just who it had been , had said she hoped that the father of the baby was n't a Jew , but there was no telling how low a strumpet like that would sink to , nor how far she would go . The Cartwrights had not seemed to be affected by any of this talk , but they might have been because Mrs. Cartwright changed right after her son was born . Little Johnny Cartwright was n't so old be/fore it was being said that he was the spit-and-image of his father . Mrs. Cartwright did n't smoke any more and her bobbed hair now did n't scandalize anyone . She had started to get fat , in the face , and she looked like a doll the way some fat women did . Mrs. Cartwright asked Anne what had happened to her foot there , and Anne said she 'd stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missed the curb . Mrs. Cartwright was sympathetic . " As soon as you can manage half a block , why do n't you drop in for a visit and a cup of tea ? " Johnny came back on the run , and Mrs. Cartwright yelled at him to be careful and told the little boy that Miss Duncan there had hurt her ankle bad , and warned Johnny that if he were n't careful he might fall and hurt his ankle like Miss Duncan or even break it . Mrs. Cartwright went on , and Anne wondered why many women changed after they got married and had kids . She would n't let this happen to her , but it did happen to a lot of women . It had happened to Mrs. Cartwright , and to Ella Wilson and Mrs. Sherbourne , and some of the other women in the neighborhood . It was depressing , and was more than enough to make her sit up straight and think , while she was still young , and had time . Marriage was n't any bed of roses and love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance , were never done , what with housework and cooking and dishwashing , the kids , and washing and ironing and shopping , and God knew what else . Coming right down to it , a lot of married women with kids , maybe most of them , worked harder than any waitress . It was going to be different for her , somehow , it was , yes , it was . She sat on the porch . A few other neighbors went by , women and men , and they spoke to her , sympathized with her , said how sorry they were about her injury , gave her advice , commented on the weather and how fine a day it was , and said one thing or another . It was just talk to pass the time of day . Norman Lilliard , a fat , jolly , and bald man , about fifty years old who lived across the street in the two-story brick house , offered to bet the buck teeth of his wife 's first cousin , Annabelle , against two plugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contest of the Charleston , Charleston , Charleston , and he wiggled , shook his torso , threw out his arms and snapped his fingers a few times , stopped , laughed hoarsely , slapped a fat right thigh , and said : " I ca n't flame so good , but then I ai n't youth any more . "  |p111Anne  smiled politely but she thought that he was a fat fool and as funny as a crutch . " Well , Little Orphan Annie , take care of that other slender ankle of yours . " She resented being called Little Orphan Annie . Every time she saw Norman Lilliard , that 's what he called her . She felt like calling him Mr. Lizard , but she just grinned at him and said as little as she could . If you gave him encouragement , he 'd go on talking , with his stupid wisecracks and his jokes that would just slay you with boredom . He turned in the middle of the dark asphalt street , and megaphonedto her : " Annie , you look prettier and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of the bum ankle for Uncle . " He tapped his chest when he pronounced " Uncle . " Then , he waddled across the street , wiggling and swaying his broad behind a little under the expansive seat of his shiny blue pants . Anne wondered how his wife and his ten-year-old twin daughters and his twelve-yearoldboy stood him . The day was changing , the sun was reflected on part of the street with a more polished glow , the shadows had grown forward and sidewiseon the yard , the sidewalks , the street , and the scrubby grass in front of the houses across the street . The branches of the oak tree were tiredly rocked by a summer wind which also brushed Anne 's cheeks and forehead , and turned and fluttered a few of her blond strands and curls . The leaves were fluffed and rubbed by the summer wind , and they shook as the wind slowly and almost rhythmically lifted and moved the big branches . This play of the wind in the trees and stirring of these leaves was familiar to Anne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pleasing variation of small echoes which almost imitated moans , friendly whistles , sighs , and even low and wordless sounds of human voices and restrained animalcalls . It was the melancholy and sometimes sad music which she heard when she drowsed into sleep at night and when she awoke in the morning , blinking her eyes in surprise . Anne listened to the wind in the trees as though it were private music played for her . The lines and the rather angular structure of her face were softened by the moodiness of her expression . There was sadness in her eyes . With nothing to do , she continued sitting in the rocking chair which had been new when she was very little . Now and then shep112rocked and the friction of the rockers on the porch was scratchy and grating . More people passed , and an increasing number of them were men , more of them middle-aged than young ; a few were gray . The homewardtrek from work was beginning . Now and then an automobile slowly passed ; a few cars parked by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom she knew and a couple whom she did n't know passed by . When two of them walked , their heels made a very distinct stamping click on the sidewalk . Kids went by , some running . From unseen but nearby houses , Anne heard two mothers calling their kids , one with an impatient , angry voice . A dog barked , and then a second one barked . A boy shot swiftly along on a bicycle . Across the street , she saw a kid of about ten , in short pants , who wore a dirty , peppery-gray peaked cap too large for his head ; he had a bulgy gray sack of rolled newspapers slung over his shoulder , and he flung them on many porches . In a few moments , he was out of sight . From nearby streets she heard automobile motors and horns being honked irregularly . From not too far away , came a steady but muffled hum and purr of automobile engines ; a telephone rang , and Anne sat up fast , but then she relaxed . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hers . All of the sights and sounds , the movements and colors of a day turning to its end , seemed to relax the very air . The many sounds , movements , and echoings of men and women , outward bound from their jobs also seemed to affect and to penetrate the world with many moods , both the world visible from Anne 's rocking chair and invisible beyond the small , chopped-off field of Anne 's own vision . The world seemed to have become a little tired , a little hopeful , a little happy , a little relieved and satisfied , a little relaxed , a little slower , a little melancholy , and a little sad . People seemed to have given all of their moods and feelings to the world as another day was forever ending . The shadows had stretched farther over the street , the silent and melancholy image of the day that was disappearing , visible and with the evidence of reality in their very visibility , but which were nothingonce they had vanished . Music from a radio came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sight , and the swift beat , the simple but quick run of rhythm , the nervous orchestration , and the suggestion of a call to some release which came from the saxophone , reacted on Anne'sp113mind and her nerves . She tapped her left foot on the porch boards in rhythm , and had the illusion of a sensation of the nerves in her right leg quivering to the rhythm of a fast fox trot . The desire to dance came to her abruptly  --  I want to dance . And she imagined that very close by , there was joy and dancing , couples racing around a dance floor , the sexual excitement of close body contacts , and strangers , more fortunate than she , who were at that exact moment experiencing the fullest and farthest hopes and desires that were in her every time that she entered a dance hall . For a second or so Anne was forlorn . Then , and while smiling a little wanly , and somewhat forlornly , she informed herself that she was merely hearing dance music from a radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wild dancing from which she was excluded . The music stopped , and then an announcer was speaking . Anne began to sing the chorus of There 's a Long Long Trail A-Winding , but stopped after the words : ... into the land of my dreams . On her face there was perplexity , concern , sadness . There was a gnawing discomfort in her bound-up , injured ankle , but , at the moment , she felt something more . In an odd way , she felt estranged . It was a feeling that dated back far before she had sprained her ankle . Her father 's death , and , even prior to that , his drinking and his patronage of the sisterhood of the second oldest profession , were much discussed and long remembered . After his death , Anne was the object of much sympathy , and concern . She was often stopped in the street and spoken to with kindness , questioned , told that she was a good little girl and should continue to be so , and patted on the head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and something like suspicion . Anne looked quite like her father . Some people wondered if bad blood would tell . They feared that it would but expressed the hope that it would n't . Mothers were not always happy if their children were too friendly with her ; this meant the little girls more than the boys since Anne was then still at the pre-puberty age . As a little girl , Anne was only vaguely aware of the attitudes toward her . But she used to draw away from people . She was suspicious ofp114nearly all grown-ups . She was angry with them . They frightened her . Her thoughts about what was so and what was not so made her want to draw away from grown-ups . It was her father 's dying that bothered her . She did n't believe that it was so about her father , but they , the grown-ups she saw at church on Sunday , they believed her father was in Hell . She was mixed up , but she did n't like them to think that . If they thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She pretty much kept away from kids , but not so much as from grown-ups . Maybe grown-ups had told the kids that it was so about her father in Hell . It was girls from whom she drew away the most . The girls had fathers and she no longer had a father , and the little girls could think they were better than she was and had more than she did . Most of the girls had fathers . She guessed it was all of them . She did n't have a father any more . The mothers of the little girls that she knew did n't have to let themselves worry about her . She stayed away from their daughters . Sometimes Anne played with the boys . When she felt like it , she tried to play with them , and would run after them . This gave her the reputation of a tomboy , or maybe a little worse reputation . Some of the mothers , hearing that Anne was a tomboy , said that this could even be a dangerous warning that bad blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and angry . Going into her early teens , into eighth grade , graduating , and going to high school , there was some lessening of this strangeness . She was n't so withdrawn . She and Abby Baker had a crush on each other and became bosom chums . A few of the girls tried to show more friendliness to Anne . She was growing slowly out of her skinny awkwardness , but she just was n't as popular as a number of girls . Her mother did n't think of arranging parties for Anne , and Anne rarely brought girls home , and Anne 's home was n't as nice as those of many girls , and she was thought to be one of the poorer girls . She did not seem like a dangerous rival , and a couple of girls who feared rivals became friendly with her . Anne , they were certain , could n't be dangerous to them , but just before she quit high school in her third year , Anne took the husky right tackle on the football team , Wallie Rollins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , the victory lasted about three weeks . Wallie Rollins had thought that she was loose , and once she had left school he stopped telephoning her for dates . Anne changed during these years because she was opening up andp115developing within herself . With the budding of her girlhood , she imagined that there was a song in her heart that she wanted to sing to the world . Whatever she had been , and thought , and gone through as a little girl , all of it no longer mattered . Suppose she had felt like a stranger ? What of it ? It no longer mattered . But , now , at home with her ankle , the memories came back , and it seemed to be on account of she did n't have enough to do , and she had her mind too much on herself . She 'd not bother with such stuff , if it was n't that she was forced to stay home this way . It was more cheerful and interesting to sit on the front porch , and to see anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She could pass the days easily sitting on the porch , seeing the neighbor women and hearing the latest news and gossip on the street . A little hen talk helped to make the day go by . What you said was of little account and what Mrs. Sherbourne , or Mrs. Cartwright , or old Mrs. Baines said was of less account . Even what Ella Wilson said did n't matter very much , if at all , and Ella Wilson was a little different . Anne liked Ella . Anne was sorry for her because Billy Wilson wanted to make Anne and would set to it any place at all and at the drop of a hat if Anne would let him . Well , it was a nice day , it was a good warm sun , a good spell of weather , and somebody 's kid was sick , had fallen down and cut his knee , he 'd stepped on a nail but he would n't get lockjaw and he was all right now . A stove has smoked , and my man , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm on my way to the A &P,; I do n't trade at Mr. Thatcher 's Butcher Shop any more , or I 'm buying some nice lean lamb chops for my husband 's supper . Then , church services , the movies , prices , going away on a vacation , or sitting at home on a vacation , and tending the flower garden in the back yard , and Mr. Bailey 's hound dog that barks so much at night you ca n't sleep a wink . Hen talk . She could talk it , too , she could say something about this or that , and , of course , she could say that her ankle was coming along , and , yes , she 'd be careful after this about the way she stepped out of an automobile , and you bet your life and your boots she was going to watch her step . It did n't matter what you said . It was dull for her and for the neighbor women . A little talk made you both forget for five or tenp116minutes how dull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you talked to yourself too much . Because nobody could do that for long . How much did you have to say when you talked to yourself ? How much was there for anybody to think about ? You thought or talked to yourself mostly when you were unhappy , had some kind of worry , troubles , when you were in love , or when you thought you were in love . If everything in your life was going pretty nice , and you were having your share of fun and good times , you did n't think so much or talk to yourself . She did n't want to think too much . If she did , and began talking to herself , she came right back to Zeke . She knew what she had to do about Zeke . She had to find out what he was like and how much he wanted her . Maybe , she would have to make him do a little fancy figure skating for her , make him know she was more than just kitten pussy , and that he had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did that , and showed her that he did , he could have pussy , as long as he wanted it , and as much as he wanted . She was sure , she was , that those who said that women did n't want it and did n't get a thrill out of it were all wet in a drizzle , and it was long past high-time for them to dry themselves . Mrs. Duncan dug out a thick bamboo cane that Anne 's father had won somewhere at some fair or carnival . She also went to a place Dr. Wyatt recommended and came back with a rented pair of crutches , which were much better than the cheap-looking and timeworncane . But the crutches had an emotional effect on both of them . The very sight of them was troubling to both women . For the first few minutes after Mrs. Duncan 's return with them , the crutches seemed to fill the entire house with threats of pain and invalidism and death . Anne wanted to postpone trying them out . " It 's no disgrace and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Duncan said . " I never thought I 'd one day be on crutches , but , who knows what , " Anne said . Touching them was like touching something ugly . But this was silly . " Well , here goes , " she announced , with joyless resolution . What Time Collectsp117The knock of the crutches on the floor and the partly smothered knock on the rug were both unpleasant for Anne to hear . At first she felt awkward , and vaguely frightened , but in just a few minutes much of the awkwardness passed and she began to perk up . The gloominess about the crutches had just been one of those moods that everybody had , she thought . She decided she was glad to have the things . Now she could get about the house better and she would be able to hobble up and down and around the street a little . Anne ventured out on crutches on the sidewalk only a few times a day . She usually kept to her own block , but she did go farther on four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone around on the street looked at her . She liked it , and she did n't . It embarrassed her . She began to feel a little resentful and sorry for herself . Strangers as well as neighbors spoke to her , expressingsympathy . But it could be irritating and tiring to have to answer too many questions from strangers . Being on crutches seemed to make a freak out of her , and she brooded over the whole business . The idle convalescent hours grew into days , and Anne drifted on a slow current of dissatisfaction and boredom . But , in a way that she did not understand , these aimless , unfulfilling days composed of nothing but a trivia-ridden perseverance from one hour to the next , served to define the aimless , unfulfilling drift of her whole life . She was restless and dissatisfied , but it would be a mistake to believe it all came from sitting around these three or four days . The trouble was her whole life , really . She was not living the way she should ; she could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she just was n't living enough . For the first time in her life , she began to see explicitly that her whole existence was too pale , too inadequate in some way  --  too unvital . And as the days of enforced reflection wore on she began to believe that she would never live the way she ought to if she just went on in this same way . Dimly , she could sense something accumulatingin her ; it was n't sheer unhappiness , nor was it any new , acutep118awareness of what she wanted  --  but it was an awareness that she wanted something , and that she 'd have to change her life to get it . What was accumulating in her was the will to change , the decision to make some kind of leap into life . What the act should be , she did not know ; but act she would . Anne did find various distractions . She telephoned several girls whom she knew , including some girls at work . And others telephoned her . Two of the girls from work visited her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got tidbits of news about Erdman 's , reports of quarrels , tales of customers , jokes , quotations of things said ; she got all that was new , all the gossip . An evening passed and Anne and the two waitresses were surprised when they discovered that they had talked and chatted until past midnight . They kissed Anne good night and told her to hurry up and get walking on her two good feet and come back to work ; everybody missed her . Anne said she wanted nothing more than to do just that . She meant it . But she 'd spoken as though watching a vague person within her and listening to the voice of that vague person when she knew that what was said just was n't all so . She turned out the lights , picked up the old bamboo cane , limped to the stairs , and slowly negotiated them ; she saw dimly and far inside herself that her return to work meant nothing ; it was related to another Anne , a used-to-be Anne , and not herself at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was talk of parties , dances , dreams , and fellows . There were even a few mildly dirty stories . Laura Linton had come by to see her also . Gee , would she faint or something if she spoke to Harold Lloyd or Charles Ray ? Maybe she 'd marry the first nice and good steady fellow with a steady job who 'd be a steady provider and stop kiddin ' herself that she 'd find a dream hero . She was no princess and not Cinderella , but only the girl who took your order when you telephoned Stone &; Son . This fellow shep119went out with , she had thought he 'd be a little different but he got fresh quicker than a wink . If she ever was to go out with a fellow who did n't get fresh and started pawing her all over , she 'd just be so full of thanks that she 'd give him everything . It was the pawing . Gosh , she did n't just want to be pawed over . She was just walking on her lunch hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the windows and you saw a hat and it 's only $4.95 , of course that 's very nearly all you make in a day , but for flooie , what 's a day and is n't this hat just really the cat 's , the crown , she just had to go right inside the store and buy it like she had to get a glass of water to drink when she was thirsty . Everybody thinks it 's darling and really the cat 's , did n't Anne agree ? Everybody at the party got in the spirit of things , none of ' em was dopey , they just wanted a good time and it was wonderful , so much fun , and it was in a big house , this fellow 's father , that 's Luther , Luther 's father must have made piles in real estate , developments or new houses , piles and the house was scrumptious , and Luther said let 's roll up the rug and dance , and they danced until way late and she did n't know what the neighbors must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those nights and one of those parties , Anne would have loved it and fitted right into the spirit of it , it was such a shame she had hurt her ankle . But Chicago must be so big , you could easy get lost in it , and in any city that 's like that , there 's so many girls who do n't care what they do that the fellows get the wrong idea and they expect every girl they take out to be the same , the kind that does n't care what she does . A fellow 's got to get something more than a smile if he takes a girl out and shows her a good time , spends his money because after all who likes to work , but if a fellow has lots of girls who do n't think there 's a limit anywhere , he gets spoiled . If a fellow took a girl out and showed her a good time , spending his money , he did n't have to think he can get away with acting like Nero , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one who , oh Anne , you know what I mean , fellows thinking they can make you do everything Nero would have made you do unless you did n't care if you were condemned to be eaten by the lions . Her boss is a sweetie , he was just nice to everybody , and even if he was the boss , he was a gentleman , and he never asked you to do something without saying Please , and he always said Thank you , and oh , he was a gentleman . Anne did n't go in for a lot of such talk , but she really liked some of the girls who 'd come to see her , they were straight and honest ,  |p120she  'd been glad they had come . She appreciated it . Plenty of girls would n't go to see their dying mother , and the girls had come a long way , all the way across town . Yes , she 'd appreciated it . Luther 's party must have been one of those parties you 're always hoping to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked it . She wished she knew Luther , he might hie interesting and not like another two-bits on Saturday night cheapskate . You did n't meet many fellows who were really interesting , and could say that they were somebody , because they had what it takes to be somebody . Just the opposite , there were so many fellows who were fourflushers , who tried to feed you so much bull that you almost needed a dose of castor oil after you heard them tell you who they were , and what they were . Big shots , yes , big shots , God , what did they think you were when they gave you so stale a line ? Yes , she did like the visits but when they ended , she fell to the bottom of the dumps . Somehow , she happened not to receive any telephone calls from fellows during those first f=our days after the first injury to her ankle . However , Anne was asked to go out often enough , and she received quite a few calls normally . On the day after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellows had called her up but this was while she was dead to the world as a result of that needle Dr. Wyatt gave her . Zeke 's was the first voice of a man she heard through the receiver of a telephone during this time . Anne did n't have to let her heart go pitter-patter and think she was a wallflower with drooping stems . One customer who came to Erdman 's for his meal at noon , Talbot Winter , and he was nicer and better than his first name , liked to take her out , and Talbot had a job that must have paid him more than some of the tin whistles w ho gave her a line about themselves as big shots . Talbot must make sixty or maybe seventy-five dollars a week working in the office of some man who gave advice to businessmen , and Talbot was smart , he dressed handsome , he asked her out on a date dancing sometimes , end he telephoned and said he was sorry about her ankle , but to rest it , let it mend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her again after nature had finished the healing course . Talbot was no different and wanted it , and still thought he 'd get it , but she did n't hold that against him , she guessed that any man who did n't want it must be someone that even his mother could n't be proud of . She found Talbot good company . Then , after Zeke called , a couple of other fellows telephoned her , and one she 'd met at a party but had hardly spoken to , George Richards , came out to see her . She 'd forgotten what he looked like , but when he said that if she was lonesome or wanted some company , he 'd be glad to come and see her , she 'd told him to come . Poor sap , he blushed like people sneezed when they had hay fever , and if he had a tongue , it was tied in a knot tighter than a miser . He must have said " Well " and nothing else at least twenty times , and it could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but " Well , " and he blushed like red roses , he flushed and got as red as if you squeezed strawberries all over his cheeks . And then , he must have been looking for the next word to say like he was looking for a nigger in a haystack . What a poor sap he was ! He did tell her that he went to the YMCA twice a week to keep fit , because if you do n't keep fit , and in good health and condition , what good would it do you when opportunity knocked on your door . And he did say , it must have been after he had said , " Well , " fifteen or who knows how many times , he said he knew opportunity would knock on his door and when it did , he would be fit and prepared to take it by the hand with a firm handshake , look it straight in the eye , and tell Opportunity that it had knocked on the right door . He said that he had prepared himself for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladder called Success . But how he said that much with his tongue tied in a knot , it was beyond her , and no kidding there , either . And he went back to " Well , " and they were quiet , just sitting , and " Well , " and he was finally able to find what he was wanting to say , and he told her that after Opportunity knocked on his door and led him to the ladder , and she felt like telling him that if he joined the Fire Department , he could have lots of ladders in any playground . And he said that once he had climbed the ladder up to a safe , secure rung , not the top which he would climb to , but when he had gone up to a safe and secure rung , he 'd seek out the kind of a girl a man with ambition needs and since he would then have the income to provide what such a girl ought to have , she would make forp122the two of them a good and happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except once or twice more , and he told Anne that she must be tired , tuckered out , and he asked permission to leave because regular hours kept a person fit for the future , and he always got up at six in the morning , except on Sundays and holidays , and he studied for an hour and thirty minutes , regularly ; he was taking a course , by correspondence , called The Keys to Success in Business . Give him permission to take leave of her ? Would a duck swim ? He said good night , commenting that he hoped he had not talked too much . When he had just left , and the front door closed after him , Anne exclaimed , " My God ! " It was only twenty minutes to ten , and she had been thinking it must have been hours . He must have come out to see her so that when he had climbed to his success , he was going to propose to her . Well , of all the fish , he was the first one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to thinking . She 'd never been proposed to , or asked to be engaged . This was a chilling thought . In the last couple of years , she 'd met she did n't know how many fellows , but it was a lot of them , and she must have had dates with ten , fifteen , easily twenty or maybe more different fellows and she 'd met fellows at parties and talked a lot with them or listened while they spoke their pieces , danced and even necked with some , and not once had she been proposed to , while other girls she knew had been and a couple as many as four or five times . Take Abby , in that last letter of hers from San Diego , she must sit down and answer it , Abby had written that three fellows all at once in a hurry just were craving to marry her more even than she used to crave chocolate , strawberry , and vanilla ice cream once upon a time . Anne did n't want to get married , no , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top , whirl like a whirligig and see shooting stars through the back of her head , but she 'd never been asked unless tonight was a post-dated proposal.  |p123Then  , she got to thinking about how time was going fast , her best years for attracting men were now . Soon , she would be past her best time , and she could be reduced to taking second best , third best , even pot luck . The worry was n't that no one had asked her , but that it might turn out that no one would . But she was n't sure she even cared . That was a bad sign . You stop caring and you could become a real Melancholy Baby , and she 'd be like a broken mirror and bad luck wherever she went . She had to snap out of it . It was so . She could give herself the new lease she needed if she went away , and met new people , and found herself a new kind of life.  |p124Zeke  made two more telephone calls , gave additional excuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was what he really wanted to do more than anything , and promised to phone her the next day . But she had not heard from him since . He was indifferent , and could forget her with less than a shrug of his big shoulders . If she gave him as little as one tear , one minute of worry , she would be a fool . His only interest was in getting her because she was a virgin . Still , Anne could understand that and put herself in Zeke 's place as a man , and she guessed she 'd want a virgin . A virgin was brandnew . But then , again , Zeke thought like all of them , and a woman who let herself be laid was no good , dirt beneath his feet , and she believed he wanted to make dirt of her . As the days went by she told herself she did n't care if Zeke never called again . When she recovered , she 'd pack up and leave Valley City . What did it even matter if she went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had hard luck , a rotten time ? The only thing happening to her here was a growing lonesomeness . Yes , for the illionth time , she did n't care if Zeke phoned again or not . She was just going bye-bye , bye-bye Anne , Little Orphan Annie without any Daddy Warbucks . Taking short walks with her crutches , she sometimes felt dull , terriblydull . Hobbling a little way along the street , it was like going nowhere . There was nothing to get excited about , nothing to be interested in , and nothing happened , nothing at all , except the or/dinary little things that went on every day . Of course , it was different for the neighbor women . They had their families , their husbands and kids . Every day , they had their work laid out for them , and they were n't young girls . Her ankle was getting better . Once it was really better , or almost better , she might feel as different as night was from day . That was what was really in her mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she 'd be crazy , and really crazy , if she thought that things in life could be made to become very much different from what they had been before she had been laid up . Her mother had gotten her a couple more books out of the library , and Anne was beginning to get absorbed in a novel by Rafael Sabatinientitled Scaramouche , when the telephone rang . She hobbled to answer the call . It was Zeke . He sounded sheepish . But still he managed pretty quickly to get around to asking her , would n't she like him to take her out , just for that little spin ? Anne said that she could n't go riding yet , but why did n't he come over to see her for a little while that evening . She spoke before she 'd thought if she really wanted to see him . He said it seemed " funny , " he meant unusual or not right that her ankle was so slow in mending . Anne corrected him by saying that this was not at all so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ought to be able to get rid of her crutches in about two or three days . Well , then , it seemed to him that she ought to be able to go out for a little spin . Anne told Zeke that he ought to be able to come over and see her . They could sit on her front porch and talk instead of taking a ride . A ride might have been good for her morale , but she 'd decided that she must not give Zeke his way . She was thinking now about what she said , while Zeke spoke . Zeke talked of how a little spin would be enjoyable . Anne held out for him to visit her and sit on the porch . Finally , like a stumped and disappointed boy , Zeke said : " Well . . . yes . "  |p126It  gave Anne satisfaction to have her will prevail over Zeke 's . She was glad for almost any visitor , and she had additional reasons for welcoming Zeke . The moment he 'd said yes , Anne had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as cool on Zeke as she had come to believe . And then , of course , if Zeke behaved her way , that would make all of the difference in the world . Anne fixed herself up for the evening . She changed her dress , and put on the dark blue one that she often wore to parties . But maybe she looked too dressed up for merely sitting on the front porch and chatting . She decided to stick with her party dress . She just had a hunch it was right . Zeke was over a half-hour late . While waiting , Anne had been anxious and hurt . Then she told herself that he was stringing her along and would n't even come . She began to read but she could n't keep her attention fixed on the Sabatini novel . The sound of a motor outside in front of her home was followed by the car stopping , with the motor dying . Anne could feel something inside her suddenly relax . She made too much of his being late . She should n't be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment . Zeke rapped loudly , and half a dozen times . It was like he was blowing a trumpet to herald his arrival . Anne used the cane to go to the door ; she had put the crutches away in the downstairs closet . They would make a bad impression on Zeke , put the idea of herself as a cripple in his head . When she saw him grinning before the screen door , she felt a wave of disappointment . " Do I come in or do you come out , Little Injured Annie ? " " The porch is more pleasant . " Zeke held the open screen door and watched Anne take a couple of limping steps onto the porch . He had a dubious expression on his big face . " Why your hoof is almost better . " " A lot better , and I do n't have much pain now unless I forget myself and step the wrong way , but I 've gotten to be good and careful about that . How are you , Zeke ? "  | " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as though he were making up his mind about something . Then , he grinned . His decision must have been made , and he took two steps to her with his arms out . " No , Zeke , " Anne said firmly , but his arms went around her . " Only a kiss , that 's not much , is it ? " he asked boyishly , tightening his embrace . " Please , Zeke , I mean it . " He was slow to believe her , pulling his arms back and letting them drop awkwardly at his sides . His face told her what he was thinking . He was stuck now . He never should have come . " Do n't you want to sit down , Zeke ? " A second little triumph was magnified in her mind . " I guess so , " Zeke slowly drawled , taking a chair after her . He looked awkward , and unhappy , sitting before her . " Annie , you look more than shipshape enough to take a little spin with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stars are out , all of ' em . " " No , Zeke , I 'd just like to sit . How have you been ? Have you been forced to keep your nose on the grindstone with business ? " His guilty expression struck her as touchingly stupid . But her sense of scoring over him gave her no lift . No , he gave her no pitter , no patter . She must have pulled a big false alarm on herself in that speakeasy yard . She turned toward him , smelling his hair oil . There was too much of it , and the odor was almost cloying . He seemed to her , well , maybe good-looking , not handsome , no pitter , no patter . . . Her own face showed little liveliness of expression . " Business is business , " Zeke remarked hurriedly . " You been keeping yourself busy . . . Annie ? " " I do n't let myself die of boredom . " " I guess the bum 's rush is going to crash the porch down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she asked . " Oh , the guys who are sweet on you . " " No , Zeke , I 've been here , pining , pining away . " Zeke reached forward in something of a lunge , and like a big brother , he took her limp hand . And still like a big brother , he told her : " No need to pine away when all you got to do is let me know , just telephone me and say you 're lonesome and do n't want to pine away . There she is , the Chalmers , always in condition to take you for ap128little spin , or any kind of spin your heart desires , big spins included . " She had to let him know she was n't the same girl as that other night . She did n't want him thinking he could crow with conceit . " When a girl 's pining , then I 'm the man for her , better than the doctor ordered . I 'm the prescription when a girl 's pining , me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service on twenty-four-hour call ? " Zeke did n't like that . He screwed up his face , and she could almostsee his mind trying to think of the words he wanted to use in a comeback against her . Anne was enjoying this.  --  I got to get even , Anne unexpectedly told herself . But that was mean . It was n't right to be mean . And why should she feel this urge to be mean ? No , she did n't feel right about it . She wanted to do it , anyway . " I was only talkin ' , Anne , " Zeke said weakly . " I know . I understand , Zeke . " " Yeh , how ? That is , how do you understand ? " " Every fellow has a line , just like a salesman , every one of them has a line , that 's all . " " I do n't have no line . " " Oh , Zeke . " Anne laughed . " Do n't you like it or expect a little line and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's there to talk about ? " " I did n't say I did n't like it . I can like it and not believe it , if I want to , ca n't I ? " " I 'm not tryin ' to make you believe something . I 'm not dishing it out to you , Anne . " " If you say the same things to every girl , then what you say gets diluted . " " What should I say ? " " It 's not what you should say , but whatever it is , if you say it to ten , or twenty or a hundred girls , well , why , one girl does n't count enough for it to mean anything . " He knew that he 'd been one doggone fool to come tonight . She just was n't a good time , not by his standards , weights , and measurements , she was n't . " Anne , do n't you want just a little spin instead of the two of us , just sitting here gassing away at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nights like this , with all of the stars out . " Anne did n't change her mind . If she went , she could n't trust her/self , even though Zeke did n't make her go pitter and patter . She was keeping herself under good control but what she wanted was right there in her . It had become something by itself , something her body craved . Talking to Zeke now , and looking at him , smelling his hair oil again , she did n't even think she liked him , and she was even beginning to enjoy sticking him . Maybe it was cruel , but even when she knew she should n't enjoy it , she did . She liked it . She must be satisfying a grudge . Yes , she was , she was getting even . And he maybe deserved it . How many girls had he dished it out to ? And how many other men had dished it out to women ? If she let up on herself , for only a minute , even , Anne knew that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it . But Anne did n't let up . Zeke just could n't make out what kind of a broad she was . She perplexed him , more than she stung him . He felt like telling her she could kiss his royal royally . Then he could just haul his ass away . But he wanted to take her out and just give it to her so damned hard and furious she 'd scream Daddy , more , more . He wanted to shove her with something she 'd never forget . He 'd let her beg for more , and , Brother , she 'd beg . Because he knew from experience that there was no other way to treat a broad . Treat them like when knighthood was in flower and all the blooming you 'd get was they 'd make a blooming fool out of you . If you wanted it with knighthood in the roses , why , yes , they 'd just bloom you all right , all right . Anne and Zeke sat on the porch , talking . They 'd wanted one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piling up . It was a night for softer moods , with the scattered glittering of moonlightall around the street . Ella Wilson and her husband strolled by , and waved ; Anne waved back . Her mother could now and then be heard moving about in the house . Anne wondered what her mother and father talked about when they had been young and together on nights like this one . And how had her mother felt ? From time to time , neither of them talked . Zeke became uncomfortable in these moments ; he kept moving and shifting on his chair , and making a clumsy spectacle of himself . After one period of silence , Anne remarked in an offhand manner that she was going to Chicago as soon as her ankle was all right . Zeke said he hoped she 'd have a good time there and an interesting vacation . You could have a lot of fun in Chicago , and he might even drop down and see her and bring some of his special red paint alongp130for the occasion . She said she was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for good . Zeke was so surprised by Anne 's words that he strained in his chair . His eyes flashed angrily . All he could understand of her announcementwas insult . He could n't think of her having any other motive for going permanently to Chicago except that of offending him . She was telling him to screw himself , he could n't have her , and just to let him know it , she was going to blow town . The chair squeaked under the weight of his straining body . He was speechless . Anne 's announcement had not been premeditated . Thoughts had just come slowly drifting through her mind while she and Zeke had been sitting , in silence . There was nothing in her life that was right and would make her happy . When she was walking again , she could n't go back to Erdman 's and go on working and living at home and doing the things she 'd done before she 'd hurt her ankle . Because things just were n't the same any more . Something was changed . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , she was changed but she did n't know exactly how . But she had to go away because she was changed . And she was afraid about Zeke . She was afraid it would only be once , and she 'd suffer . Her craving could n't be satisfied just once . And she could n't love him if she wanted to stick him and hurt him even when she was craving for him . She was afraid of more than once . Chicago . She 'd go to Chicago and her feelings would be new , she would be new , all brand-new . Zeke did n't know what he wanted to do . But kicking her teeth in sure would be a pleasure , one hell of a pleasure . After the way she was for him outside Happy Harry 's just before she twisted her lousy ankle , now she could act like nothing happened , why she had been so hot she was a conflagration . And so , she was just going to get herself up and go away to Chicago . He ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by kicking her ass all the way to Chicago . She was going to do this just to spite him . He knew it . That was a teaser for you . Maybe she was bluffing , and her real intention was to hook him . Like his mother always said :  --  Zeke , those girls are going to try to get you if they can . They 'll snare you in a trap . You ca n't make one misstep or one of them will get you . " Any girl goes to Chicago , she gets a bad reputation , " said Zeke . " It 's my reputation , " said Anne . " Besides , there are ways to get abad reputation right here in Valley City . There are plenty of fellowsp131a girl could be seen going out with if she wants to lose her reputa-tion . " " What do you mean ? " said Zeke , verging on petulance . " Does n't matter , " said Anne . " It matters to me , " Zeke said righteously . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad reputation through me . " Anne laughed : " Why 'd you take me out those two nights ? " " Well you sure acted like you liked the reason I took you out those two nights  --  or else I was only dreaming about what you were like when you , you know , turned your ankle there . " He gestured at her ankle . " What are we going to do ? " Anne asked . " We going to act like two babies ? " Zeke shrugged his shoulders . " I do n't care . It 's not my business . " Then his face took on a crafty look . " Of course , you going away like you said , so sudden that way , it might make some people , you know , suspicious and set a lot of talk and gossip going around . It 's not my business , of course , and you know you can rely on me not to do any talking or gossiping around . " Anne 's mouth popped open . " What the hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Zeke , raising a conciliatory hand . " There 's no reason for getting so het up  --  I 'm not hinting at anything . " He spread his palms in innocence . They stopped talking , like two people out of wind . Anne had gotten keyed up and her craving was gone . Zeke had pouted like a little kid , and he 'd gotten sore , more angry than he 'd really let on . He did n't want her to go to Chicago and this flushed her up . But she had to go . She had to get her life out of its rut . She thought of Chicago , of skyscrapers and hordes of people rushing by on the sidewalk , and she imagined herself getting off a bus and walking away on the gravel of a bus station , carrying a suitcase . It would be easier going to Chicago if she had some girl friend to come along with her . Zeke broke in on Anne 's thoughts : " When you thinking of leaving for the big city ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't tell the exact day yet . Depends on my ankle , and on other things . " " You know , " said Zeke , " it might not be so easy to live in Chicago as you might want to think . Chicago is a big , hard , rough-and-tough city . "  | " I 'm not afraid of that , " said Anne . It was getting late . The block was quiet . The lights had all been turned off in the white house opposite the Duncan home . The tranquillityof the night began to affect Anne , making her somber . The peace that hung upon the street was different from those times during the day when it was quiet . She was feeling quiet inside of herself . That was the way it often seemed about this time and on nights like this one . Nothing mattered except to be quiet inside of yourself . If she could only believe that she would get this kind of feeling from Zeke . But nothing mattered now , but to keep it inside of herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She would n't think . Zeke was very restless . Anne could almost feel his nervousness . She must n't let it get into her and destroy her quiet . She wished he could feel this quiet like she did . Would she feel it in Chicago , this quiet ? She was going to be all alone there . Being all alone , what would it be like in Chicago ? Anne 's face in the darkness suddenly became distorted , distressed . Maybe she would n't be able to bear it , all alone in Chicago . Mumblingly , Zeke said that he guessed , maybe , she must be getting tired . Anne said , yes , she was . Anne quickly decided that she would have no trouble getting rid of Zeke for the evening . She wanted it that way , she wanted him to go . But Zeke did n't leave without another try at Anne . Anne stood up when he was about to leave . His arms went around her instantly and he tried to press kisses on her . She dodged his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , but Zeke only gave up when Anne let out a moan . A sharp pain shot through her foot and the region of her ankle . Anne , then , sank back down into her chair ; she was crying . Zeke stood above her , like a big lubber , his thoughts and feelings all lost in one encompassing confusion . He made a stumbling apology , saying that he had n't meant to hurt her . Anne told him she did n't think that she had seriously reinjured herself . She was hoping that he 'd go quickly . He did . She watched him go down the steps and on to his Chalmers atp133the curb . IIe turned and gazed back at her . There was a pained and bewildered expression on his face . He went around to the opposite side of the automobile , got in by the wheel , crashed the door closed , and drove away like a shot . Anne assumed that it was all done between herself and Zeke , it was all done . That would be for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this with some disappointment , doubt , and sadness . She was just very tired , and things were n't clear to her , things were getting all mixed up in her mind . When she was in bed and falling asleep , she found herself suddenly thinking it would be best for her to forget Zeke and go to Chicago . During the next several days , she did not hear from Zeke . It was a time of gloom , but she did not lay the cause to Zeke . The cause of it was just everything . There were moments when a telephone call from Zeke would have caught her in such a mood that she would then and there have promised him a yes and invited him to see her right away , as soon as he could . Her desires were a torment , a fever that could burn her up . They were a nervous fire . They made her feel a craving so strong that she did not think she would or could fight herself to control it . It would be too hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in her . It rained for two days . It was cold . The damp weather ate into her ankle . She was confined indoors , and her spirits hit bottom . Had Zeke managed to see her then , she would have surrendered to him in limp despair , in a kind of symbolic suicide . Several times over the next few days she thought how something had almost come off between her and Zeke . But only " almost . " Zeke and she were n't for each other . So , the scene was done , finished . And it was , was n't it , always said that time heals . In a little while she would hardly think of Zeke . And he would n't think of her , except perhaps to feel sore and dislike her , maybe hate her because men she guessed did n't really forgive a woman if she turned them down . Anyway , it seemed best to let the matter lie where it was . She wanted to try her luck in Chicago . She could only give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago becausep134she was a girl . Chicago was n't full of wild Indians and Huns who raped you . She could take care of herself with any man who did n't bowl her over , and if she was bowled , that would n't be danger . And Chicago was n't at the other end of the world . If Chicago did n't work , she could always come back here . If she got a job and lived in Chicago for a while and then came back to Valley City , would n't she be returning as a different person , more sophisticated , able to dress more smartly , and knowing more of life and the world ? In general , she ought then to be a more interesting person than she was now . And suppose she found just the man of all the men in the world , and suppose he turned out to be good-looking , even better , handsome , and well off , with a good job and money ? Suppose she came back like that , married ? What all of this boiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go , just as quickly as she could . After the two rainy days , the weather turned hot , too hot for comfort . At last Anne was able to discard the crutches . And Dr. Wyatt told her that her ankle was coming along mighty fine ; pretty soon she would even be dancing . She brightened up because the end of her time in a trap was in sight . While Anne began to dream of a new life , her mother 's life was drab , and lonely . And were Anne really to leave , it would become even more lonely . Anne was hurt by her mother 's life . It hurt her to think that she could go away and be free , find fun , excitement , adventure , and happiness while her mother would go on living in the old house all alone . This included the wintertime , when the wind filled the house with creaking noises and squeaks and strains and whistles . She could remembernights as a little girl thinking it sounded like the moaning of ghosts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And a couple of times , it seemed even like the voice of her father 's ghostp135calling out the most awful call , crying out with wanting to come back on earth and live again . Her mother would have to be all alone with these noises , and with the darkness outside . Her mother believed in ghosts , too . How could her mother bear it ? No , how could she bear it on winter nights if she was in Chicago , and her mother was back in the old house , alone ? Anne was the last one . She 'd often thought that her mother did n't care , but she knew this was n't so . Her mother did care and she had been so especially good to her since Anne had sprained her ankle . Her mother had seemed happier , too , than she was before . It was because she had more to do . Her mother liked to feel that she was needed . Anne hated to think of this . Would n't it be wrong of her to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on here ? Did n't she owe something to her mother ? Her mother could , of course , sell the old house , and move into a small apartment . There was Aunt Harriet , her mother 's sister who lived in Arlesville , Valley State . They could live together , because Aunt Harriet was a widow . And then , Aunt Marion had asked her mother to live with her and her husband at Whitedale , which was only fifty miles from Valley City . And there was her uncle , her father 's brother . Or , also , her mother could go to Terre Haute and she 'd be with her grandchildren , then . I-Ier mother wanted to stay on in the old house . It seemed that she wanted to live on with her memories . Her mother just did n't seem to want any kind of change , and even kept the old furniture as long as she could . No matter what happened , her mother would go on living in the house . Anne was sure she knew why . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to him here in the old house . It seemed that by living on in the house and keeping all of the old furniture that she could , she was showing him that she loved him and was faithful to him . Anne had felt very much the same way as a little girl after the death of her father . When she was in and around the house , Annep136had used to feel closer to him . She imagined that wherever he was , he 'd know this . And she had wanted him to know it very much . She 'd wanted him to know that she loved him and that she was n't mad at him because he had seemed to stop loving her . She was n't mad at him for anything . This had not been absolutely true because she had been mad at him for not paying more attention to her , and because of his drinking and on account of him letting himself die the way he had . After brooding all through her recuperation about leaving for Chicago , she finally told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd said she was getting a better job . Her mother became pale , and she herself felt terrible , like she 'd wanted to cry . It was all of her life that she was going to leave behind . But that was like getting rid of your broken dolls , not that Anne ever played much with dolls . When you broke the dolls you bawled your eyes red and it seemed like the saddest thing in all the world had happened to you , but you did n't feel that unhappy for very long . Later , when you threw the broken dolls away , you remembered how terrible you had felt and you even felt again a little of that sadness in memory . But the point is you have to throw away the dolls and forget all about them.  |p137Anne  Duncan did not leave Valley City for Chicago . Instead , she married Zeke Daniels . On that night when Zeke sat on Anne 's front porch with her , he had driven away like a bat out of hell . He drove recklessly through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That Duncan broad was the kind a fellow hears about but never expects to meet . And the only way to treat a broad like that was to give her a good solid smack right square in the teeth , throw her down on the ground , and give it to her until she cries for Mama , Papa , Uncle , and Santa Claus . Lay her and lay her out cold . She was going to Chicago . Let her go ! Let her go to Tokyo , Japan ! Let her go to Hell on a roller coaster ! Zeke decided that he had had more than enough of Anne Duncan , and that if he ever saw her again , it would be in Hell . When he calmed down , he judged that he had just as much as laid her , it was a technical lay because of her sprained ankle . But something had happened to spoil things for him when he 'd seen her . She was bad luck and he just felt sorry for any poor fathead who would be sucker enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to forget . But he was wrong . In the morning , Zeke began thinking how he could get even with her . He 'd been played with and teased . Now she could go around laughing up her sleeve at him . Unless he just made things even Stephen between Zeke Daniels and Miss Anne Duncan.  |p138On  and off all of that same day , his thoughts turned back to Anne . She was a little item of unfinished business and Zeke Daniels was the kind who always aimed to finish his unfinished business . What would she be like ? He remembered her in his arms at that moment when she twisted her ankle . And remembering her passionate , hot kisses , he got all worked up.  --  I got to make that broad , he told himself . He would call her up and say that he was sorry , apologize , then , ask her for another date , tell her how much he had kept on thinking about her . Say how he understood how she must feel , being tied down at home like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . So , he 'd just thought she 'd enjoy a good movie , and he wanted to take her to one . But he changed his mind . He did n't telephone . It was better to let a couple of days go by before giving her a ring . Otherwise she could get the idea that he was too hot and eager for her . And once you let a dame think that way , your goose was cooked . And last night , she 'd been a little snotty with him , needling him , and then refusing to let him take her out for a spin . He 'd made a mistake going to see her and sitting on the porch after she 'd refused to go for a little drive with him . This could be considered a giving-in on his part . And once a guy gave a dame the upper hand , she played him for the biggest fish in the aquarium . Why , she 'd even have him stuffed and nailed to a board so as to have her girl friends see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of a dame to be given the upper hand . And she would n't get it , not from him . But actually , he was afraid to telephone . He 'd have to ask for a date , and when he did , he 'd get refused . That night , Zeke and a friend went out in Zeke 's car and cruised about trying to pick up a couple of girls . They had no luck and Zeke went to bed grumbling to himself . He had to get the Duncan dame out of his mind . Zeke thought he had succeeded in forgetting Anne until lunchtimethe next day . He was wolfing up a hot roast beef sandwichp139and mashed potatoes when Ed Hawkins asked him how he was making out with his pretty new victim . Zeke flashed a proud smile of conquest but it only concealed the humiliation he was privately nursing . He boasted : " I kissed her so hard she 's laid up at home with a badly sprained ankle . " Ed kidded him about being a Tarzan and a caveman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told himself that if the truth were known he 'd become a laughingstock . He could just hear Ed Hawkins or some other fellow rubbing it in , maybe saying :  --  She tried you out , Zeke , and did n't like the sample . So she broke her ankle fighting to get out of that bear hug of yours . She did n't want any part of you , Zeke . Zeke thought he might telephone Anne and get some slant of the lay of the land . Anne 's bum ankle was more than a good enough excuse for buzzing Anne , and if he only asked how the dog was and gassed for a while with her , but did n't ask for no date or to see her , he was of the opinion that would be a smart way of showing his indifference . Let her understand that hers was n't the only petticoathe was trying to lift . Then , in about two days , he would give her another buzz and repeat the formula of indifference , and then , maybe she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zeke . Instead of calling her , he telephoned " a tramp " named Hazel , took her for a drive and the results would have been all that Zeke desired but for a simple difference of identities . Hazel was Hazel , not Anne . He went home feeling like he guessed Babe Ruth might if all he did was hit fungo flies way out and over the fence before the ball game started but never got up to smack home runs in the real ball game . All he 'd done with Hazel was fungo . He had gotten all wrought up because fungo was the wrong word , and Hazel was the wrong name . He was getting ragged for Anne Duncan . She was doing things to him . She was making him feel that he was walking around in a wet dream . If his pals had any glimmer of the state he was in , they'dp140sure split their guts laughing at him . He 'd be a real sideshow to such likes as Dull-Pill Archie . He had to do something to get that Anne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all doggone . But Zeke delayed doing anything . At various times in his boyhood Zeke had collected the tops of pop bottles , cigarette boxes and packages , cigar store coupons , cigar bands , rubber bands , marbles , and tin foil . He had also collected stamps halfheartedly , and mainly by asking his mother to buy him stamps . One Christmas , he received a big and expensive album , with his name stamped in gold letters on the heavy blue board cover . That Christmas he threw a raging tantrum , and his parents never knew that the cause of it was the stamp album . Zeke had wanted boxing gloves and a BB gun to shoot pigeons , sparrows , alley cats , the bulbs on telephone poles , take potshots at the behinds of little kids , and shoot through the windows of vacant homes . Most importantof all , he wanted other kids to envy and admire him on account of his owning a BB gun . Stamp collecting had been the idea of Mrs. Daniels . She had bought the album rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zeke the apple of her eye , and she believed he was superior to all other boys . He would grow up to become a great man . She praised him excessively for the most trivial reasons . But praise is one thing and affection is another , and she had never given Zeke any of that other or shown a sincere interest in him . Zeke became a resentful mama 's boy who went through a mimicry of pleasing his mother . Mrs. Daniels used to say that Zeke was all-boy , and that all boys who were all-boy collected stamps . After about a month of stamp collecting , Zeke 's original , mild interest died , so he feigned interest to please his mother and fool her into praising him . Few of his stamps ever were pasted into the album . And he managed to get the boxing gloves and BB gun not long after Christmas . His marble collection meant more because he could show off with it in front of other kids . He could prove just what kind of a kid Zeke Daniels was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could shoot much better than he . He finally lost all his whole big marble collection , including expensive immies and canucks . His other collections did not mean much to him . But he liked to talk about them as if they might be important , and he bragged of their growing size and value . And Zeke laughed up his sleeve wheneverhis mother , other adults , and kids took these collections so seriouslyand praised him for them . From time to time , Zeke would abandon his collections in boredom ; then he 'd begin new ones . Old collections were thrown out with the garbage and trash as soon as the new one began accumulating . Zeke grew up conditioned to take himself as very special , different , important , a little boy who was expected to live up to something big . He had been spoiled , and confused with rewards and praise . He was protected from difficulties . He was helped too much , or else excusedcompletely from hard tasks of , say , learning . Ile was rewarded for close-to-everything , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveal any symptoms of having much of a mind.  |p142Zeke  Daniels had grown up to become a healthy animal , his wellbuiltif not gracefully formed bulk reeking of maleness . To girls , Zeke was strong , though not silent , and he seemed good-natured . He was conceited , but it is the strong , not the weak , who have conceit . He said things that made you laugh , if you were a fair maid , but they did n't mix you up because you did n't understand them . Ile was like a great big boy , maybe sometimes a little spoiled , but big and strong , and almost like a bear . He had his own kind of charm , and there was an earthy , elemental thing about him . But skirt-chasing was not always a pleasure to him . On some nights when he was out on a date with a dumb-Dora , he wished he could be doing something else , like gassing , or playing pool or poker with a few fellows , or seeing a good movie , especially a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports pages , the funnies and this and that in the evening newspaper , maybe reading an adventure story about the sea , or the wild West , or the far places of the world , or listening to the radio , to jazz music or something about crime or that was funny , and then hitting the hay early and sawing logs for a fare-you well . More than once on a night made for love , with all of the stars out shining , and the moon up and out , and all of the rest of the scenery being what it should be , and where it ought to be , he had been making speed with his arms around some Hazel by another name , why he had thought of what he 'd give to be seeing all over again one of William S. Hart 's thrilling movies like Tumbleweedsor Square Deal Sonderson . He 'd never seen any actor in thep143movies , bar none , who gave him a thrill and a wallop like he got from William S. Hart . And once in a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a church dinner or something where he 'd be seeing and talking to a lot of the old ones . Hell 's hisses , he did n't like nooky-wooky because he liked it , he loved it . If he did n't , he would n't be natural or normal . All he meant was that sometimes , and with some of the dames floating around , waitresses and broads , and Hazels by plenty of one or another name , they did n't care who the guy was , and they were no good . They were just bums you would n't let in your home except maybe if all the folks should be away and you were having a wild party or a wild time of it . And yes , all he meant was that sometimes you had to have it and have it bad , and sometimes you wanted it , and sometimes it was so-so and take-it-or-leave-it . And sometimes , again , it was like doing it for the record . You figured that 's one more , and maybe the first one named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Anne Louise , or the first time you laid a new nationality , Polack or one whose old man was Bohunk or Scotch , something new , and sometimes you just wanted to tell some of the boys the next day about what you had done last night . But you did n't know , and , of course , you were always hoping that you were going to have the time of times . All he meant was that this was how a guy was . But dames , hell , basically , that 's all they were , the young dames , and the only kind of a guy they could really respect and remember was the guy who would capture them but not let ' em turn defeat into their winning victory . Or something like that.  |p144Zeke  's mother used to tell him that he was going to be a great man when he grew up . He said the cat 's nuts to that ; he was n't going to sacrifice his fun and the prime of his life and wear his ass out making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of himself so as to give his old lady something to crow about . Not him , Z for Zeke , not on your canary bird 's tweet , tweet , twoop , would anybody find him doing that . Let his old lady crow to old crows , let her crow about he did n't care what . He was n't going to be what she wanted him to be . He was going to be Zeke Daniels . He would work along in the family business and sell insurance here and there , and have a good time in his prime . When his old man croaked , he 'd be one of the heirs , and the business would get bigger , anyway , big enough , and maybe , since he was usually liked by all kinds of people , or most kinds , people would come to him and they 'd want to elect him an alderman or to some other office , or they 'd want him to be something . Meantime it was something of a joke the way he was fooling everybodyby making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he could n't get enough of it . He was always on the sniffing trail for new coose . He was getting this great reputation as a collector of coose and all the guys envied him , even the married men who ought to retire because they were getting old . It was like he was being a champion and setting a record . It was like his career . Zeke kept all of the addresses and telephone numbers that he could in the little red-covered address book he always carried with him . Hep145got a lot of fun out of flashing the red book , and kidding and being kidded about it . He would joke about how he would n't part with his little red " sin-book " for gold . And someone would always crack that any time he wanted to , he could set himself up in business , and with that red address book of sin of his he 'd make a rich man 's living . Zeke collected as many names , addresses , and telephone numbers of dames , as he could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These fictitious entries included five for Chicago , two for St. Louis , three for Cincinnati , one for Louisville , Kentucky , two for Indianapolis , Indiana , and all you wanted or even could handle for Terre Haute , Indiana . He was always being asked for a telephone number and these requests gave him a chance to get in some nice kidding and ribbing of his own . However , Zeke was damned careful about the names and telephone numbers that he gave out . These were the broads , " the tramps " who were n't particular or choosy . Catch him giving away a good thing . Also , he would n't pass out the name of a broad who would n't lay , or of one who 'd say things about him , or could give any reason or cause for any kind of comeback on him . He liked it to be said around that if Zeke Daniels gave out a name and telephone number , you could count yourself fixed up for an evening . Zeke 's skirt-chasing had gradually become more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parody of an effort to gain fame and becomea great man . And it was something of a joke , something of a way of expressing contempt and getting his kind of revenge upon his mother . The laws concerning perjury did not hold for street corners , pool halls , dance halls , restaurants , speakeasies , private automobiles , homes , offices , parks , roadhouses , and other places and vehicles where Zeke Daniels might report a new item in his growing collection , another broad laid , another victory . However , Zeke was inclined to worry whenever he attributed to his own prowess , victories that he had not really gained . He kind of worried for fear that he might trip up , over his own story . He had his sweats , now and then , for fear that the truth should leak out . Let him be but once caught in an untrue boast , and , why he 'd never hear the end of jokes , jeers , jibes , insults , and laughter . One false claim exposed , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had legitimately won . Success and reputation breed envy , and Zeke believed that he wasp146envied like a local Babe Ruth , with his bat buttoned up inside of his pants . He knew that he was the object of mounting envy , and that his exploits were derided as bullshit . Two pals of his , Al Caton and Foggy Warner , who had no cars of their own or their family to use , had rented an automobile in order to follow Zeke on a date and get the goods on him , show up Zeke Daniels as a boasting fourflusher who was full of crap . On that particular evening , Hazel had been all that Zeke could get , but Hazel could n't have helped him more had she been a beauty queen or an angel instead of Hazel the tramp . Al and Foggy saw that Zeke got what he 'd said he would . Then , Zeke told Hazel to let his buddies have a crack at her , a request agreeable to her . And then that little punk , Dull-Pill Archie Gary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the dope , showing that Zeke said he laid a broad he did n't really lay . Sometimes , when he thought of all these pressures and pitfalls and everything , he wondered why he did n't just fart off the whole phrigging game.  |p147That  Saturday night Zeke Daniels had a date to meet a housemaid in front of the railroad station at a quarter to nine in the evening . For three days , he had worked himself up in lecherous and voluptuous anticipation of this date . He conceived of it as part of his plan to help forget Anne Duncan . He knew that housemaids and domestic servants were n't likely to give him much of a rise , but on this Saturdayevening the particular housemaid whom he had lined up was an exciting novelty with possibilities . Her name was Melikka , which was , in itself , almost worth an evening . There was no name among his successes that could even approach Melikka for being unusual . She might be anywhere from twenty-five to thirty , but she was rosy with health , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hefty one and built like a she-fullback . Melikka was a blond-haired beauty with such blue eyes . Zeke , who at best only casually noticed the eyes and but rarely remembered their color , did remember " beautiful and blue , " the eyes of Melikka . And her smile , with her perfect white teeth , had been more than friendly and she was full of joy and gratitude because she had been asked out on a date . Melikka had been born near some place in Finland that was pronounced something like Hells-something , and she had been in America just about one year , and had somehow gotten out to Valley City and was working for some family that was well-heeled . She had been given a couple of hours off on the previous Wednesday afternoon , had taken a trolley car to the center of town , and , then ,  |p148she  got lost , or pretended to be lost . Zeke guessed it was her way of getting picked up . Melikka had asked Zeke a question about where she was and a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accent , like a Swede 's , and he 'd had some trouble understanding her . Patiencehad won out , and not only did he get the drift of her talk but he also got the date . A Finn or a Swede , not American born , he 'd never had that . Neither had any guy he knew . He figured Melikka was a peasant , poor and kind of primitive , not exactly uncivilized like Indians , but not like Americans , and as he guessed and expected , she 'd be natural , and not have any what they call inhibitions , not like so many girls who do it and like it , of course , but still kind of feel it 's bad , a sin . Melikka did n't grow up with the refinements that a lot of girls had in America . Melikka would be natural . he was mighty curious , too , about what noises and sounds she 'd make . He might get something unusual to report to the boys . She 'd be so natural and wild he ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That would be a little on the cave man or the natural side . And that was what she must be used to , being a peasant and so on . She was a foreigner , a servant , and he was an American and for all she knew , he could be as rich as the husband of the woman who hired her . She 'd look up to him . She had him wanting and wanting badly , brother , yes , she did . He kept wishing that it was already Saturday night . He was saving himself , with nothing in between , because he wanted to , well , say uphold the honor of the good old U.S.A. Doing that , he 'd be able to figure on Melikka a little regular , and he 'd have something unusual to talk about , and then there was this  --  if there were any little angles or wrinkles or tricks that they do in Finland around Hell-something , he could pick these up and if the tricks etcetera were good ones , well , he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go over big with them . Zeke arrived at the station at quarter to nine on the nose . But no Melikka . Zeke waited in eagerness and impatience , and then in uncertainty , in anxiety , in hurt pride , in anger , in disgust , in contempt for ignorant foreigners , in rage , in humiliation , in false indifference , and also in hope and in hope against hope , but no Melikka came . At nine-twenty , Zeke abandoned all hope . He was unfit to be tied becauseanyone trying to tie him in his condition of extreme unfitnessp149to be tied would have gotten part of what he was raging to give Melikka , who was born blonde and with the bluest of blue eyes in or around a place which in English sounds something like Hell-somethingand is somewhere in Finland . Zeke wished he could have blackenedthose bluest of blue eyes and then fixed up that ignorant sheforeignerso that she would get the hell back to Hell-something where she belonged living next door or just around an iceberg or two from the polar bears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any Melikkas . Hung up on Saturday night by a greenhorn maid . And he could n't even pick up a piece of the evening by getting Hazel . Good-hearted fool that he 'd been , he 'd fixed up Jack Thornton with Hazel . What had Jack Thornton ever done for him except join the needling crew that tried to keep sticking him and pricking him on the subject of broads until they 'd rile him and have the fun of laughing as he kept blowing his lid off . And so , he was so smart that he fixed Jack Thorntonup with Hazel . Zeke walked to Al 's speakeasy which was in a converted store near the railroad station . The wide window was painted black almost up to the top , and a new wooden door , with a peek-hole had been installed . Zeke called his name a little anxiously when the peek-hole opened . Not to be let in for a drink would cap the climax . The door opened . Zeke entered a dingy , weakly illuminated room , whiffing a strong , bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned . The place was filled with men of various ages . Some were dressed in overalls or other clothes which identified the workingman . Others wore business suits . The talk was loud . Some men swayed and staggered . The place was hazy with cigarette smoke and thick clusters of it were hanging under the ceiling . Wooden tables were spaced about the room but more of the drinkers were standing than sitting . Zeke saw a small empty table in a far corner and he sat down by it . He looked around the room and wasmore glad than not to find no one he knew on a second look at the customers . A few waiters , who had something of the look of skid row bums , were kept busy . A dark-haired fellow was at the door ; he wore a fancyp150pin-striped dark suit , and Zeke guessed that he might be a dago . Al was a thin little man whose features were sharp and his eyes looked still sharper . He 'd come home from the war broke as a coot , borrowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcohol . He got friendly with a couple of tough babies who had been released from the pen in time to get in quick and early as bootleggers . They took a liking to Al and helped him get going in this dump . Al was making good money , owned a Cadillac and had built himself a $25,000 home out in a good residential district . The two ex-cons who had helped him were big shots . Thinking of this , Zeke 's anger was forgotten . A light-haired waiter , with a face all blotches , took Zeke 's order for a shot of moon . He was served quickly . The stuff bore a remote resemblance to whiskey . It cost thirty-five cents and when it was set before Zeke , along with a small glass of water for a chaser , the fumes were strong , acrid , and almost caused gagging . It was too lousy to drink . Zeke shrugged off the thought . If he did n't have a little cast iron in his guts , he was n't much of a man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any humiliating coughing , sneezing , or gagging . But the stuff tasted damned bitter . It burned and cut his mouth and tongue raw . It hit his stomach like sudden fire . Then , it left warmth and a feeling of small lumpiness . Zeke lit a cigarette and gazed around , seeking companionship , someone to talk to . Al was talking about races and horses at another end of the room . The customers must have numbered between forty and fifty , and the dark husky in the fancy suit kept opening the door fairly regularly , mostly to admit more customers , and twice to let fellows out . Every time the door opened , there was a whiff of slightly cooled air , which was inviting in freshness and seemingly pure by contrast with the foul thick air of the dive . It was smoky , acrid with alcohol fumes and a raw , strong odor of alcohol , and , also , with a burned odor that suggested burned cork and wood . There were various other smells and mixtures of smells . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toilet opened and closed with irritating regularity , and each time someone went in or came out of the can , an odor depressingly heavy , of strong , stale urine escaped into the room . The conversation was part roar and part a distinguishable inter/mingling of fragments of words . Some of the voices were thick , or slow , or stuttering because of drunkenness . The place looked very tough , and it was rough and dangerous , particularly if you got too drunk to know what was going on . Some bums and hobos who had no flop and slept on the waiting-room benches and floor of the railroad station might be hovering some place outside , waiting to roll the drunks . If you blew your horn like a bazoo in here or got rambunctious , there were guys who could be mean , mighty , plenty mean . Some of them had , they must have a gun or knife on them . If you sat and minded your own proper z 's and p 's and g 's , you 'd get out of here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd was a funny-looking mixed-mash of men , old and young , and there was all kinds of talk . An old fellow , with a gray cap pushed up back on his pretty big head , saying in 1893 in Chicago he worked on the grounds of the Columbian Exposition and people from all over the world came to it . Fellow two tables away , peaceable fellow in a neat suit , wearing a stiff collar , medium way between an Arrow collar and a high collar , saying , yes , the booze here and plenty of other booze nowadays had a powerful , bitter taste , but it was n't no ways as powerful and as bitter as the tongue of his wife . Fellow with him , must be forty or along about that and he looked like he sure did n't collect much joy and happiness in along about forty or so years saying , well sir , the womenfolks listened to the preachers and their mothers before ' em listened to the preachers and they got it all set in their minds that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ai n't wrong . Lifting his little jigger with a little of his shot of moon left in it he said here 's to a little joy to sinful creatures before the fires of Hell are stoked for ' em . And the other fellow , one at the same table , saying that the way he calculated , it was giving women the vote that made things worse because once they got the vote , they began to get bigger'n their husband 's boots , and besides running the home and the kids and makin ' sure the parsons run the churches the way the women want them run , the women were going to run the country , too . And another fellow saying the women and the preachers between ' em run most of the country now and look at the booze a man has to drink , thanks to them . The waiter with the blotched face returned to Zeke 's table and Zeke nodded and pointed to his glass . There was an excitement here in this low-down dive , only hep152wished he had some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guy to talk to . Yes , this low-down joint was an excitement , but it was also mighty funny . Think of the powerful lot of sinning that was going on here . Zeke laughed , thinking what a powerful and pretty tremendoussinner he was , himself.  --  Ai n't no one in the congregation a more powerful sinner or a more powerful singer than Zeke Daniels . Zeke burst into a loud laugh in appreciation of his own wit . The blotchy-faced waiter served Zeke and was paid . The speakeasy was getting noisier , more crowded and the number of drinks had increased . Zeke 's earlier mood of depression had come back upon him . He was fed by the depressive atmosphere of the joint . Lonely men drinking but recently distilled moonshine in a dive where the air was rancid . A little fuzzily he recognized a samenessabout them all  --  they looked like a collection of also-rans to him , losers , standing around shooting their mouths off and bragging so 's to cover up , but he could see through them . Bunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself associate with such low life . Zeke downed his second jigger of moonshine , but not without a little gagging , coughing , and sneezing.  --  The most powerful sinner and the most powerful singer in the congregation , Zeke Daniels . The second shot of moon hit his stomach like fire . The taste stuck in his throat . Perspiration formed wet beads on his forehead , and soon , it was sliding down his face . He felt a sickening weight of pain in his head , and then a throb which seemed to shiver some of his pain . His eyes filled up with tears , and as he rubbed them , he lowered his head and went to his pocket for a handkerchief . A wide , dulling band of pain pressed through his forehead . As he wiped his teary eyes , a whirling motion began in his head . He was dizzy.  --  God , did I get a Mickey . . . Finn ? Zeke blinked his eyes at the moving , milling , and wavering crowd , and saw the men through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . It was like a dream . His round and somewhat fat face wore a foolish and silly look . His head was getting light . He was growing weak.  --  Mickey . . . The table was pitched forward to the floor and a glass crashed as Zeke lurched to his feet . The noise of the crash resounded with an excitement and a sensation of motion in his brain.  |p153An  impulse bred by his terror sent him forward like a fullback stumbling and half-falling forward after having been hit off balance while plowing through the defensive line . His terror carried him on despite the weakness spreading through his body with vertigo , a throbbing in the head , and nausea . He pitched forward , bumping men , and with a brushing swing of his shoulders , sideswiping a glass out of the hand of a small fellow . He stumbled and half-tripped . He tottered off balance in a semi-slow motion , his head and torso too far forward to be in balance . Hence , he began to bend and shake like a rubbery-legged man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It appeared as though he must fall either flat on his face or with his round chin cracking into the grayish unvarnished board floor . But he swung a little sidewise , like a prize fighter knocked out on his feet , he swayed in a small arc , he took one , another , and another chugging step , all like a gross imitation of a child imitating the motion of a choo-choo train , and , then , he was falling helplessly forward ; and he was a big man , almost a brute of a man , who had become helpless . He moved in almost uncoordinated motion ; his chin wagged slowly downward . Some of the drinkers watched Zeke , in trapped and motionless awe . The husky in the fancy suit snapped forward , to catch and propup Zeke under the armpits ; the blotchy-faced waiter sprang to Zeke . " Do n't hit the bum , " a man called out . " Do n't hit him , " Al ordered in a voice slightly loud and excessivelycommanding . " Help him outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 's a respectable fellah . " Because of his sagging limpness , Zeke was like dead weight , as heavy as rocks . Tony and the blotchy-faced waiter awkwardly shoved , partly dragged , and helped Zeke outside . Zeke let out a noise that was a combination of groan , gasp , and gargle . A slight but cooling pressure of wind played against one side of his face . He was held half-bent and helpless in Tony 's rigidly powerful arms . " You 're all right , fellah , " Tony said in a coarsened tone of voice which made all of his words sound as though they had been mispronounced . The cool play of the wind cooled the wetness on Zeke 's face . He was breathing out of his mouth and making low gasping sounds ; but he was , also , taking in the fresher night air after the thick befouled air of the speakeasy . He emitted raspy sounds . There was a raw bilishp154taste in his throat after a very small quantity of liquid and mucous were forced back up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Tony said . Zeke mouthed air like a sick man , nay , like a dying man . The shadows of several figures stood across and down the street , vague but ominous in the blue-and-gray night mist . " I do n't want him splashin ' puke on me , " Tony said . But Zeke 's head was clearing . He was weak but less dizzy . He was n't going to puke on nobody . He saw the nondescript thick , hard colorlessness of the sidewalk . The shadowy atmosphere was weakly infiltrated with mist and haze . He had a strange notion , like a series of sensations coming like beats after pauses , that the world was slowly moving . He was moving , and he knew where he was even though he was crushed with pain behind his forehead . He was sweaty and damp . He was thinking , Oh God , home . . . his mouth and throat were foul-tasting , and he was gagging a little . Zeke straightened up , and Tony relaxed his support . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drunken slur of words . Tony asked him if he knew where he lived and how to get home , and Zeke repeated that he was all right . Tony loudly and crisply barked a commanding suggestion to the ominous shadow of figures , that this customer would be unmolested . Zeke , weak and feeling retching sensations inside , felt very sick . " Sssanks , " Zeke said , the sound coming through forced by pressure through a resisting thickness of tongue . Zeke was in a hell of a shape but his condition was navigable . Tony and the blotchy-faced waiter had gone back inside . Zeke turned right and the street of darkened store fronts was just sufficiently indistinct to be unfamiliar to his eyes ; he was seeing through a glaze . After he had taken about seven or eight steps , Zeke abruptly lurched to the curb and puked . His consciousness seemed almost obliterated except for thoughts like silent , wordless groans of self-pity , pain , and a pleading hope that the uncontrolled flooding up of an internal mess , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could almost be like dying  --  oh , that there would be a merciful end to this , all of this . Zeke finally reached his car , and he drove all the way home at a meek thirty miles an hour . When he was at last sprawled in bed between clean white sheets ,  |p155and  he could feel himself ebbing away into drowsiness , Zeke suddenly raised himself on his left elbow and looked to the shadowy flatness of the vacant side of his bed . He said aloud , and somewhat in the manner of a petulant boy : " Melikka , I hope you have your monthlies on the first night of your marriage . " Then he dropped onto his back , and very soon , his heavy snoring was the only sound in his large and dark bedroom.  |p156When  Zeke woke up at about three o'clock on Sunday afternoon , his glumness was like thick mud in the sluggish river of his mind . The stupor of sleep still deadened his countenance ; he looked dense and moronish . Because of his Saturday night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Sunday was pretty well shot , and since he had nothing lined up for the evening , he saw only hours of boredom in front of him , then more sleep , and the beginning of a new week with a blue Monday , a goddamned black-andblueMonday . He felt a kind of muffled and low growl of meanness and anger in himself . He wished to Christ that he could have slept on through until tomorrow morning instead of having waked up to such a shitty end of a shitty day . After taking a shower , shaving , and dressing , putting on the pants of his snazzy suit of light and very soft gray wool , he was almost in better spirits . Sunday dinner was long since over , his father was sleeping , and his sister was out somewhere , with a dope if his guess meant anything . And ask him , he 'd say yes , his guess always meant something , damned tootin ' , right so , it did . Mrs. Daniels cooked his breakfast , making pancakes , scrambling three eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that he liked it . He took his mother 's doting service for granted as his due , wolfed his food , and relished hearing her tell him how his presence and his voice had been missed at church that morning . He was sorry that he had n't made the services . A faint smile appeared on his thickish lips . Hell , his singing was ap157joke on the old ones . Like he always thought and told himself , biggest sinner , biggest singer . A good one , he told himself with a silent laugh . But a vague uneasiness was seeping through him . What was botheringhim ? He had a faint trembling sensation . Hell , it must be a little hangover from last night . But he was n't convinced . He should have come home last night , instead of going to Al 's to guzzle a few . Al was a rat son-of-a-bitch  --  a worm selling furniture polish moonshine to put worms in the belly . Al ! Stick it up his nose , left side . He yawned . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not only for the singing . Well , next Sunday was another Sunday , and anybody could bet his mother 's boobies , that next Saturday night was n't going to be like last night . Not as far as Zeke Daniels was concerned . " Did you have a good time last night , Zeke ? " Mrs. Daniels asked . She knew he 'd been drinking but would n't let on ; she was hoping that he 'd tell her himself . " Oh , I was just talking with Jack Thornton and a couple of other friends of mine , Mother . " " It 's a pity you got home so late , and too tired for you to be up in time for church . Why , so many people asked for you . I was a little embarrassed . I passed it off by saying you were n't feeling well . " Zeke had a hunch she knew he 'd been drinking . His pants and shoes . She 'd seen the puke on them , or else he did n't know his lovin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shots . " I hope none of the straight-laced holier-than-thou busybodies think you were drinking , that you got drunk . Of course , Zeke , I 'd understand . No one will ever understand you as well as your mother . Not even when you meet some decent girl you 'll love and get married to her . " Zeke made a face . The one thing he had no intention of doing was to march down the center aisle , to the altar , to the strains of Here Comes the Bride . Was n't only his mother who spoke to him about getting hooked . Some of the old ones at church mentioned the awful thing . And those who did n't , they thought it . He 'd even bet his toolworksthat some of ' em wished they were young ones and could marry him themselves , and let him tool them with his toolworks , he 'd bet on this proposition . " I was n't drunk last night , " Zeke blurted out . " I only had two drinks but it was such rotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head , Mrs. Daniels stared at her abashed and perhaps slightly naughty little boy . For an instant , he thought that she was wagging her finger at him , when she was n't gesturing at all . In his guiltiness , Zeke also felt a growing surly resentment . She was treating him like a little boy . " Oh , Zeke ! " she exclaimed with a quick , nervous toss of her head . Her voice sounded worse than merely reproving ; it implied that his was the kind of incorrigibility , harum-scarumness , and thoughtlessnessthat would be the life and death of her yet ; and it also implied that Zeke , by his conduct , was a burden to her . Zeke caught all the implications ; he 'd been familiar with scenes like this for many years . " Zeke , you have more intelligence , " Mrs. Daniels said , reproof oozing through the flattery . " It was just real rotgut , Mother . I only had two drinks , little jiggers , too . And I had ' em about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart . " Zeke 's natural manner with his mother was well-trained deception , a subdued mockery . His resentment and contempt were masked by a very complex , almost ritualistic act that he put on for his mother . It was second nature to him by now , and he could play the part with his left hand , cajoling her , paying a kind of mild obeisance , concealinghimself , and , always , demeaning her in his mind . He had developed his mode of response as a boy ; by the time he was sixteen he lacked the skill , subtlety , and soundness of instinct to come up with any adroit new responses , except rarely and more or less accidentally . His mother was quicker , more intelligent , and far more clever than he . But he frequently deceived her , and her sense of his insincerity was only vague , and scarcely articulated . She knew he did n't really love her , or else , he loved so weakly that she characterizedhis emotion as affection , rather than love . But then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She let it be assumed , even by herself , that she loved him since she was his mother , and he was her baby , her favorite , the apple of her eye . When she conceived antagonistic thoughts or feelings toward him , she almost always rechristened them as merely annoyance or frayed nerves on her part . Zeke 's mother sat down at the opposite end of the narrow kitchen table as though she were going to have a talk with him . She let her hands rest on the new table covering , yellowish green oilcloth withp159small red cherries in the design . Deliberately silent , she watched Zeke with a twinkle in her gray eyes . To Zeke , this had the effect of softenedbut disconcerting ironical laughter . It was one of Mrs. Daniels ' ways of convincing Zeke that she loved him but did n't know what , in the name of the Lord , she could do about him . But he was used to this technique too . Mrs. Daniels ' son , Zeke , Ezekiel , was n't sucked in by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that something was n't right . And dang dingle it , he was a man now , and he could n't be under his old lady 's thumb . Nope , he could n't let her try to twist him around her thumb the way she did his old man . he got a kick out of never being sucked in by his old lady . He got a bigger kick out of fooling her without her knowing it , and such like , stringing her along in one way or another just like he 'd done so many times for quite a lot of years . " I do n't see where there 's anything so wrong about havin ' a drink or two . Some of the best people in this here town do , " Zeke said . And he meant that , too . " Your father used to drink , take a drink with the boys before we were married , but he stopped . " That was something he had heard before , like he had heard the whole kaboodle of parsons saying the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like all the things he 'd heard said that went in one ear and out the other , things like the wages of sin is death , and like , heck , he did n't care to remember them all . And he knew that on the qt his old man now and then did sniff a little snifter . Breaking into a smile , she said : " No , a little indulgence need not be harmful . " Zeke grinned , responding to her smile as much as to her words . " I suppose Reverend Goodhall has got to say something about the evils of drink , but he does n't hit it awfully heavy . What was the subject of his sermon this morning , Mother ? " " Goodness , what was it ? " Mrs. Daniels asked herself aloud , giving her head a little toss to the side . He usually did n't remember the sermons . But how could he ? He never listened , because he was always thinking about one of the wellbuiltyoung ones sitting nearby . " Oh , yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced before us . He cited the railroads . What would we do if those who came before us had not built the railroads ? " " Walk , " said Zeke . Mrs. Daniels , with another fling of the head , laughed pleasantly . " Zeke , you sometimes say such funny things . But you always did , as a boy . " A young one , tossing her head as his mother did , would sure be appealing . His old lady must have been something when she was a young one . It took no trouble overworking your imagination trying to understand why the old geezer had gone for his mother . He could have , himself . But no guy could have gotten any place with her , not without the ring and the wedding bells . She was smart . And plenty , yes , plenty , must have had a yen for her . " Does n't seem to 've been much to the sermon this morning , " Zeke observed . " And I would n't say there 's much religion about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world of the spirit . Much has been done for us in the realm of the spirit , " Mrs. Daniels explained , but with an elusive supercilious smile . " So much has been left us , but we take this too much for granted . We should know that a heritage has been given unto us , and be thankful , show some gratitude , and it 's a duty , a responsibility for us to do like others did before us , build something for those who will look back on us the way we look back on the ones who built the railroads for us and the rest of it . " " I guess so , but it 's no use , is there , in our buildin ' more rail-roads ? " " Zeke , " Mrs. Dainels exclaimed , " you always did beat the limit . " She flattered her son even more than she reproved him . Zeke sat , unresponsive . If he got caught discussing this sort of thing , he 'd end up in tangles , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then she 'd have him tied up with ropes and where would he be ? Maybe listening so that Wedding Bells Will Ring So Merrily . Funny , but of late , now and then and at odd moments , this sort of thing would suddenly pop into his head . But he was what you called an eligible young man who was coming to the time of life when he ought to be picking out his one and only , and so forth . And his mother was all ready to help him do the picking . He was certain of that . This was all cat-and-mouse , only he was n't a little mousy who was going to be caught in the kitchen by the big cat.  |p161He  lit a cigarette . His belly was full now , and it was time to think about what he was going to do with the rest of the day . He meant the night , since it was already a little after four . The day was gone like a tire that had picked up a tack and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you want any more coffee ? " " No , Mother . I 'm full up . " " You 've eaten enough ? You do n't want any bananas and cream , or anything else ? " " No , I ai n't got room now for anything more . " The twinkling eyes became penetrating , and the elusive and dancingplay of smiles ceased . Mrs. Daniels closed her left hand over the bent knuckles of her right hand , and pressed them for an instant . She held Zeke in a closely attentive gaze . There was nothing catlike in her suddenly changed manner ; rather , it suggested something of a big watch dog . Zeke 's round , thick face became protectively blank . Whatever was going to come now from her , he did n't want to hear it . He did n't want any serious talks with his mother . He did n't want her telling him what to do . This is what he expected she would do . Zeke decided to make a quick break . Then he 'd go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exciting for him to do . His old lady was certainly giving him a little bit of the jumps inside of himself . That was no good . Yes , he 'd just get up and say he 'd almost forgottenabout it , but he had to meet a guy , Jack Thornton , any name would do . " Zeke , I worry about you , a lot . " " No need to worry about me . I can always take care of myself , " Zeke said , offhand . " All men like to think they can take care of themselves , and I suppose they can , in some ways . " " I 'm not gettin ' in any trouble , and nothin 's happening to me for anybody to worry . All that happened to me last night was I got a little sick to my stomach . " " Oh , Zeke , " she snapped with impatience . " You ought to know me well enough to know I 'm not that kind of mother who makes mountains out of molehills and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I did n't say you were like that . All I 'm tryin ' to explain is there 's no reason to worry about me . " " That 's just the reason why sometimes I do worry . "  |p162Zeke  was thrown into bewilderment ; he did n't understand what she meant . Why should she worry because he was n't getting hot and bothered about himself ? " But why should I worry ? What 's there to worry about ? " She fixed him in very close attention . " Zeke , do you ever ask yourself what you 're going to be ten years from now ? " " I 'll be doin ' all right . Everything 's gettin ' better . Business is gon na be better . Paw can retire and we 'll still be all right . " " Oh , Zeke ! " Mrs. Daniels sighed ; she shook her head slowly , as though she were stumped , sympathetic , regretful , pained but , at the same time sadly amused , because Zeke was so far from understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving him the treatment that might be given to a little boy who really did n't know his way around . She might think this was funny because she thought he was so dumb to what she was driving at . The laugh was his because Mrs. Daniels did n't begin to know her son , Zeke , christened Ezekiel . He should n't let himself get worked up and have the jumps inside of himself . He would n't . He was n't worked up , and all of this was the same old horse , and it did n't faze him a bit , at all , atall . It did n't . It tickled him . But he did feel some kind of pressure . In a way he did not understand , his mother 's speech vexed him . " Zeke , you 're just not anybody , and I do n't say this to you only because you are my son , the apple of my eye , and because I love you with a mother 's love . I do n't worry for fear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dogs and to the Devil . "  --  Maybe the Devil and me are just like that , close , Zeke silently said . A forced little laugh escaped from Mrs. Daniels ; she continued : " I do n't have a shred of worry but that you 'll always take care of yourself , that is , unless you are fool enough to allow yourself to be caught . " " No babe 's catchin ' me , " Zeke said , coldly and with a hardened self-assurance that was also self-flattery . Almost too swiftly to be noticed , Mrs. Daniels ' face was shadowed by an uncontrolled false smile , a rather silly grin . She spoke instantly , but with a vague nervous fluttering or tremor in her voice . " I 'm talking to you , Zeke , for your own sake , not for mine . Andp163I hope you mean that , and for your sake , not mine . After all , Zeke , you have to live your own life , and no one else can live it for you . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shame for anyone like you , Zeke , with all of the opportunities you 've had , and with what you are and can make of yourself , yes , it would be a shame , such a pity for you , Zeke , to throw yourself away and to throw away your chances and opportunities . " " I do n't know what chances I 'm throwing away , " Zeke said ; he was puzzling over what his mother was getting at . Mrs. Daniels was annoyed by his remark , and she showed it with a glance . The fact was , Mrs. Daniels was not at all certain about Zeke 's chances and opportunities . Had she attempted to tell him what these actually were , she could n't have done so very concretely or specifically . Mrs. Daniels had just spoken to Zeke out of the past , the years of his boyhood when she had truly believed that he did have exceptionalchances and opportunities , and that he might even grow up to become very important , a famous and a great man . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own ambition for Zeke , her youngestchild.  |p164Actually  , Mrs. Daniels had not wanted Zeke . During her hard months of pregnancy , she had carried Zeke in fear . Zeke had been her sixth child . She had had twins born dead , and then a Mongoloid child had been born about fifteen months before Zeke . This monster had lived only two weeks . She explained both cruel mishaps as the Will of God , and she gave every sign of accepting and bowing to the Divine Will in a spirit of humility and courage . Mrs. Daniels had faced the world with dry eyes . She gave the impression of recovering very quickly from her woman 's sorrow . But this was only appearance . She had , in a profound way , been broken by her cruel luck . To her , it was not a matter of luck . She believed that she had been made to suffer by the punishment of God because she was guilty and sinful , and she could not reason herself out of this belief . Pride was almost torn out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman was all but crushed . Her capacity to love and be loved was withered like flowers in a severe frost . She became cold in sex and when she submitted to her husband , Tom , it was an act of wifely duty . She often simulated excitement , but only rarely did she feel any real excitement and gain the pleasure and satisfaction of being gratified . She went on living and functioningnormally and she seemed to be a happy woman , though perhaps too bossy and self-centered . When her twins were born dead , Mrs. Daniels only chilled within ; she did not freeze . This process was not completed until she bore her Mongoloid infant and saw it lying still , growing cold , looking sop165hideously deformed in death , with the big head , the wide and flattenedskull , and the face , with all of the human features , so inhuman , so frightening with abnormality and with the semblance of utter and total stupidity . Her heart , her love had gone out to the dead little thing she had carried and given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her love would restore the baby to life . She had prayed . But the face , drained of color , with a ghostly pallor ; the skin still soft , puckered , dry ; the closed lips a little wide , and like a dark stain ; the nose , stubby and so pathetic ; the little wrinkling and darkness of skin closed over the eyes , the look or aspect which was almost animal , and the whole face that could not grow warm and alive from her love . Her love , going out from herself , had seemed to return from that little face , which seemed much bigger than it was . But then , the same face had seemed to be a cold and pitiless accusation . The fixity of death on the Mongoloid features was an accusation , awful , unanswerable , inescapable . She had stood alone over the crib , which somewhat resembled a swing or a boat held between flat end pieces , looking at the features that were animal yet-not-animal , human , but not-quite-human . The room had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gleaming snow and the sun 's rays on the frosted window panes . Frances Daniels did not cry ; she could not cry . She gasped , her mouth was opened wide in agony and terror . The torment of her entire being came twisting out onto her face . She turned away from the crib . In a few minutes , the dead Mongoloid infant was taken away in an ugly little black box of a coffin by Mr. Ponsomby , the undertaker . Her face was composed ; she was very calm . She said : " Who are we to question the Will of God ? " Mrs. Daniels had wanted the Mongoloid child . She had carried it inside of her with the belief and the feeling that love was coming back to her , growing within her as her new child was growing in her womb . She would find restoration in the new child . The chill left in her when the twins had been born dead would be warmed away . Her sorrow would fade almost into full forgetfulness . She wouldp166nurse and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , for she convinced herself that it would be a boy . He would grow up to become a fine man , a great man , and she would grow old , basking in all that he was , in all the sunshine of his greatness . There would n't be a mother more proud than she in all of Valley City , and that would be the way she would grow old gracefully and graciously . As the months of her time passed , and as Frances Daniels kept growing more big and swelling with her child , she lived into the future with concentrated hope . This helped her to sustain herself . When she screamed with pain in her travail and labor , she was still sustained by her concentrated hope . And the child was born Mongoloid , and the child died . She could not hope again as she had hoped . She could not feel any joy when life was once more growing within her belly . She could not relive old expectations and she could not live for new ones which were but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulfillment in motherhood . Her womanhood had been used with shattering cruelty . She had labored and sweated , moaned and shrieked and screamed through rhythms of pain which rose to a crescendo of agony , her life 's blood had flowed , and the infant that was her own flesh and blood was a poor bundle of helpless flesh . Her baby was abhorrent to sight . The poor creature could shock the heart of others with fear and slow , creeping terror . She had gone down once more into a woman 's valley of the shadow of death , and what she brought forth seemed to be worse than death , and it had died ; it had been Death . While vanity and pride inflated into the grandiose had been large within her , she had also felt love begin to expand . In time her love might well have become larger than her pride or her vanity . But when she stood over the crib in the heartache of her farewell look , she saw her love shriveled into a malformed , dead image . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ugly black casket and dropped away in unknown earth . During the weaks after the birth and death of the Mongoloid child , the story of Job in the Bible and Job 's example was much in Frances Daniels ' thoughts . Several friends mentioned Job , either to her or top167Tom , and she knew that others compared her , and Tom , too , to Job . Although she was stricken with despair , her damaged vanity and pride were not completely extinguished , and she derived a grim satisfaction , a grim pleasure in the knowledge that she was compared to Job . She was even flattered . And while she understood why people spoke of Tom , she did n't honestly believe that her husband deserved to be complimented for behaving in the best Christian , Protestant , Methodist example of Job . At home , Tom took the blow harder than she , and often in the evening , he would sit brooding and staring at the burning , crackling logs in the parlor fireplace . He would be silent as the tomb , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frances had to cheer him up , console him , and keep up his spirits . Tom was better than most husbands , but men all seemed cut from one pattern . Judgingfrom their behavior , they suffered more than a woman when a baby was born and they took more of the credit , passing out cigars , and some of them celebrating their accomplishments drinking whiskeyor beer . Tom took this one hard , as if he was responsible . Frances was convinced that the bad seed was in his family , not in hers . One night , though , Tom had said that there had been nothing like this that he knew of in his family . She could have screamed at him . Tom blamed it on her , not on herself but on her family line . When the twins had come dead , Tom had acted much the same way , and it was he , not she , who gave the evidence of suffering the most . But for her Tom to be like Job , that was a joke and she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh . He could n't say Terrors are turned upon me : they pursue my soul as the wind . Nor could he possibly say my welfare passeth away as a cloud . And the Lord had not taken away his desires . He was dying to get at her , and she could n't now , she could n't . And was it Tom , or was it she who could say like Job : My bones are pierced in me in the night season . . . ? One evening , the first time in more than two years , Frances had opened the family Bible , and she began reading the Book of Job . All of her hopes and dreams , and the great love which she had carried within her , along with her dead baby , it had been hers , hers alone and only . She would not , no , she could not share her grief with Tom , let alone with anyone else . It was hers , hers alone . It was inconsolable grief . It was like the griefs wailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Book of Job for consolation . But as she read , Frances Daniels found less consolation than she believed that she was seeking to gain . In truth , she was preserving her grief . She could n't let it escape out of her . She could n't permit it to sink away with the minutes that came , but then were gone , were gone away . Frances Daniels ' grief preserved a ghost of a love that she wanted to feel , and of pride and vanity and ambition which had grown fat because love was lean . There was no abiding consolation for her in the spirit of the Book of Job . For many reasons , it was not in the woman to say or think with the full meaning of her feeling and her self , the words of Job : Wherefore I abhor myself , and repent in dust and ashes . She wished not to do penance but to have the continuing punishmentof a hidden sorrow . She took her religion for granted , accepted it by habit , prayed by rote , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and usually visualized as a figure robed in white Who was up there somewhere in the blue sky , of the Devil as horned , wearing a mask fixed in a grin or else possessed of indefinite features which looked vague except for a leering grin , clothed in tight-fitting but not quite skin-tight black , and the owner of a black , curved , almostnever-wagging tail which was of varying length . Her visualized conceptions of Heaven and Hell were of equal simpleness and literalness . Her beliefs , and her views on sin remained rooted in what she had been taught and told in childhood and in what she had read or heard from the Bible , although these had been softened and , in some respects , modified . She knew what adultery and fornication were , and she understood that when a man and wife cohabited , they were guilty of no wrongdoing in the eyes of God or man ; but the idea of sex as sinful , ugly , and animalistic had been so well absorbed in Frances ' childhood and adolescence that it remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excess of self-consciousness about sex . She quite regularly lacked enthusiasm for sex , or else feared that she might be lowering herself because of an outburst of excitement and passion . Apprehensions and fears sometimes seemed to have had no cause ; they merely happened to assail her , to trouble or to distress her in sudden and unexpected moments , or to come at times when herp169moods would run low , for instance on her blue days . And there were times when it was much the same with guilt and shame . While she did not let her mind dwell much on sex as such , Frances Daniels believed that it must be very important to and necessary for men ; women bore sex more than they enjoyed it . Sometimes , it even seemed foolish or silly . It was the sorrow and the punishment of women to bear children . The idea of punishment had been so well planted that it had sunken deeply down into the very base of her nature . It was all part of the way things were , the way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Jones , the family doctor who delivered the Mongoloid , told her she was wrong to consider the baby as a punishment inflicted by God . God worked in mysterious ways for His own ends , and these were good like God was good ; Dr. Jones did n't think that God punisheddecent , fine people like Tom and Frances Daniels in this terribleway , and the causes of the birth of such children were natural , not supernatural , except in the sense that the cause behind all natural causes was , of course , supernatural . There was nothing to be ashamed of . In the same way , red hair or brown hair , blue eyes , the sex of a baby and all such things were naturally caused . Only this sad misfortunedid not happen too often , even if it was more frequent than most people imagined , and thank God for that . Dr. Jones was right . He must be , because who could know about these matters better than a doctor ? She believed it , she did , she believed that Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . But then some pendulum of guilt would swing back within her , and she again had the feeling that she had been punished by God . Why and for what she had been punished was unclear . Sometimes , she would imagine that , maybe , God had punished her for sex . Perhaps she had liked it too much on one of those fairly rare nights when she had actually enjoyed intercourse . Or she had wanted to indulge only for herself and her pleasure , and not as a duty and in order to suffer the fate God had ordained for her as a woman , a daughter of Eve . Or it was just that sex , for no reason she could think of , was sinful , something to be ashamed of doing . More vaguely , the reason for her terrible punishment might just be herself , a sinful woman.  |p170God  knew her every thought and deed and , in His eyes , she was bad , sinful , a creature far different from what she was believed to be by those who knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hypocrite . She pretended . She was false . She hid her real self from the eyes of everyone in the world , but that real self was a scar , a hideous scar , in the sight of the Lord God . In her pride , had n't she forgotten , ignored , even scorned the Christian virtue of humility ? She had been proud , too proud , and oh , how pride goeth before a fall ! And she had been vain , she had wanted a son who would grow up to become a great man , even the greatest man in the world because as his mother the credit and the glory would shine for her . She had dreamed of his greatness because she wanted to be more important than other women , superior to them , and able to lord it over them . She must have lived only for the little things of this world which passeth as the dust in a storm and not for the big things of God 's other world which lasted and would last longer than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she did n't know what she thought . Flow could she know why God had chosen her to receive the blows of His punishment , even though she was a sinning and sinful daughter ? Was she worse than so many other women , and was she more sinful , more to be despised ? Did she alone , among all of the people that she knew , look so unworthy before the Throne of I-Ieaven that this most awful retributionshould be imposed on her ? No , it was n't true . It could n't be true . Dr. Jones was right . But it could be true . If she got afraid because it could be true , others , neighbors , women in the congregation must be thinking that it was true . Did she dare go on believing that any of them had spoken to her , truly and from the heart , when they had expressed their sympathiesbecause of her tragedy ? Flow could she know what they really thought and believed ? Behind their smiles , their eves of pity , they might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale of God 's mercy . And if any of them did see her in such a bad light , then what must n't they be imagining about her ? They 'd believe that she 'd committed the most horrible and secret sins , adultery , oh , horrible sins in secret . They might be laughing at her , criticizing her , reviling her , making up and spreading God knew what kind of stories and lies about her . And even if none of the women were saying and thinking such things about her , the humiliation she had to bear before them was terrible enough in itself.  |p171Bent  over the Book of Job in her bedroom , she looked thoughtfully at the darkness against the narrow window pane , and she murmured to herself :  --  Blessed be the name of the Lord . Her mind was on the twenty-first verse of chapter one . ... Naked came I out of my mother 's womb , and naked shall I return thither : the Lord gave , and the Lord hath taken away ; blessed be the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . She believed that resignation , acceptance had come to her . Yes , God had given , and God had taken away . God had mercifully spared her by taking away and her sorrow and humiliation were as nothing to what they would have been if the poor baby had lived . But had n't she wanted the child to die ? Was n't she really glad , happy , no , not that , only relieved because her baby had been taken away so quickly ? Despite all of her sorrow , her agony , and with the grief she felt , there still was relief , because the baby had died so soon , so easily , and without pain . It was great relief . But : ... In all this did not Job sin with his lips . And Frances Daniels . She had not sinned with her lips or by speaking any foolish thing against God . She was full of the sense of sin . Had n't she wished her baby 's death ? Frances Daniels read , rapidly , and with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from thoughts which struck her with a nightmarish dread . She jerked inwardly with tension when she read of the ulcer with which Satan struck Job , from the soles of his feet to the top of his head . It was unbearably sickening . But almost immediately , she escaped from her shock and found herself in the story as Job 's wife , and she saw herself telling the stricken Job to curse God and die . And she wished that Job 's wife had been given a reply to Job 's words : ... Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh .. . Because she wanted to know more about Job 's wife . Job had not sinned with his lips , but neither had Job 's wife . And Job , not his wife , had been put to the test of suffering and calamity . Then why should it be herself , the wife , the woman in her own home , whop172had been made to suffer as Job had suffered ? Job was n't a woman and a woman paid God with suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eve , and why add the fate of Job to that of Eve and impose them both on a woman ? Maybe Torn was the one who was being warned and punished . Then she read : Let the day perish wherein I was born , and the night in which it was said , There is a man child conceived . And this she felt . She read on in roused , excited bitterness , plunging herself freshly into her misery , and rushing her mind across the words . She jumbled together the blurred meanings through her compulsive haste . She saw the world as a darkened image which was overwhelming in its sadness . She believed that she , herself , was miserable in the center of her heart , the marrow of her bones , and in her belly and female organs . But such misery gave her a fullness of release ; it gave stinging satisfaction , the pleasure of pain , a kind of joy or near-joy in terrible joylessness . In this mood , Frances went through several chapters , mechanically forming and telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor understood them because she was so fully absorbed in the almost exhilarating despair which she injected into her darkened image of the world . Suddenly , she closed her eyes , and for a few moments , she kept herself blinded with blackness.  --  Yes , shut not up the doors of my womb , she told herself , rememberingJob 's curse of the day on which he was born . But , oh , if the door of her womb had only been shut in time ! She would n't have gone through her woman 's sorrow of sorrows . Frances Daniels knew that such wishing was like wishing she had put a lock on the barn door in time . But still she wished it . She was cold to love now , cold . No , not to love , but to that , sex , which was n't love . And , No ! It was n't the highest form of love . But then Frances knew that she would n't be able to convince Tom that the two of them would be happier if they just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world , loving each other , at least holding affection for one another , well , at least tolerating each other , and showing their best front before outsiders and to the world , while , at the same time , they did not go on together in bed and act like what had now become to her a mere animal thing , an animal act.  |p173Tom  would do almost anything she wanted him to , even though at first , he would often refuse . She could always find a way of getting around him , and changing his mind and having him give her her way . But not on this nasty thing , the nasty act . He 'd keep trying and trying to get at her . No matter how many times she refused him , when she held him off too many times , then , he could be a troublesome husband . If she did n't let him , he could n't do it to her . He would n't rape her , and even if he tried , but of course he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least that , strong enough to prevent him . But by refusing him permanently , she 'd pay the price of having him sniff and smell around her , and keep at her , and , well , having him be troublesome until she let him . Probably , he would act and feel the martyr . He 'd feel abused and aggrieved , thinking that he was forbidden to have and to enjoy what was his by right . And she was sure she 'd have a harder time of it , getting things out of Tom , managing him , and keeping him toeing the line even as much as he did . Tom would think that he was in the right . Frances had learned that the best way to handle Tom was always to keep him in the wrong , and herself in the right . She did n't intend to give Torn reason for brooding about himself as a mistreated husband , sorry for himself , and her having to go on sleeping in the same bed with him . For then , she would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited , with nothing else on his mind except to pounce on top of her and the rest of it . And that could happen night after night if she gave Tom the upper hand . It made him feel good and he 'd finish , roll off her , perhaps turn away from her , with his head facing the other way , and he 'd sleep like a baby . That was the way he was , his nature , and it was nature in him , and he could n't help it . Mrs. Battleford felt much as she , herself , did , but Henrietta had finally refused to let Hiram Battleford have anything to do with her , and for some years , to this very day , there was nothing but bad blood between the two of them . The Battlefords would never live down the scandal , and everybody in town believed and said that Hiram Battleford consorted with prostitutes , low women . That was what Hiram began doing , on the sly . He 'd done it by himself , alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married men started going along with him to those creatures . That was how the Battleford home had almost been broken up . Henrietta Battleford then finally had to relent and give in toHiram . Everybody in town , everybody who knew the Battlefords , orp174anything about them , everybody in that sense , believed that Henriettahad given in , and surrendered too late and that Hiram Battlefordhad had too much of the taste and habit of sin . He could n't , or , he would n't give it up . But Frances Daniels could n't make herself believe that Tom , her Tom , would follow in the footsteps of Hiram Battleford . However , notwithstanding , Tom was a man , and men were all alike . All of them were too full of the Old Adam . Almost all were , anyway . Take , also , and for instance  --  Tom had promised her that he would n't drink . She knew that once in a while , now and then , Tom did take a drink or two , never too much , but still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She made nothing of it , and Tom , man Iike he was , was n't even on to it that she knew . If he would fool her about having a drink or two , would n't he deceive her about the other thing ? She was very much afraid of that , that he 'd fool her and do as Hiram Battleford had done . Frances knew that she could not keep the door to her womb shut , not permanently . Sooner or later she would have to allow Tom to take his pleasure . There had been times , on her honeymoon , and in the first couple of years of her marriage when she had just been so swept away and she had just screamed out and it had seemed like such an ecstatic thing that was being made to happen to her . The cry of the carnal and the flesh was in everybody , and she was no exception . If it was still with Tom the way it had been on her honeymoon those first times after her first night which had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself and be confident that she was more the mistress over her carnality and the call of her flesh than Tom was master of his . It could happen that she , herself , could be reduced to the state where the lower nature and carnal desires would shake her up and then overpower her at the expense of everything else . She could get worked up so that she just had to be satisfied . During the early period of her marriage , that kind of thing had happened to her more than it did now or even more than it could any more . But nevertheless , and in all honesty with herself , she could not say or believe that she was so above carnal desire and appetite that shep175would never again want to be satisfied , and perhaps even made to feel that her whole body and she , herself , had been ravished with joy . Yes and , alas , she , too , Frances Daniels was flesh , frail flesh , and the flesh , yes and alas , the flesh was weak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so much greater than the gaining of these joys . This had been so even in those times when she had been so excited , and she 'd thought , fulfilled . But no matter what joy she might ever hope to find in the flesh , she did want to shut the door to her womb . If she only could do it , she would , yes , she would . Because of Tom , she couldn't.  |p176In  those days , one of Tom Daniels ' greatest pleasures was his rocklikeconviction that in the eyes of the world , that is , in the view of his friends and acquaintances , and , even , other Valley City people , he was a regular fellow . He was a chipper little man with a mustache , a glad hand that performed with quick sociability and perfected habit . A smile could come over his thin face with a flying start , while his brown eyes exhibiteda ready-made twinkle . Tom was conditioned , almost mechanicallyto be one of the boys . It was only a lucky accident that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tad Dorgan cartoon . Tom enjoyed the image he had of himself as a great shakes ; and like so many other great shakes and regular fellows he was playing a role with ripe and fully assimilated banality . He had succeeded in making a human popinjay out of himself . And Tom Daniels relished the illusion that on these occasions when he was at his most as a great shakes , he was really acting and being himself , the real Tom Daniels , a male in a masculine world . He needed an untroubled feeling , a link with his sense of certainty about himself as honest Injun . And he swelled in his chest and his vanity because he could think that every inch of him was as much of a regular fellow as any regular fellow he knew . Tom thus gathered some compensation for the many brave adventuresthat had never been his in life . It was the same with all the loves and romances which he had known only as the meager imagery of daydreams . All of this was part of the belief of Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even less than every quarter inch , as much of a man as any next fellow you 'd find in Valley City , or even in Valley County . Tom was fully convinced that he was unaffected and never posed , never really , in a serious way . He always was himself in the regular fellow atmosphere of a shirt-sleeves poker game , in a saloon , at the Elks Club , at luncheon with his cronies , and , generally , in the man 's world of regular fellows . Tom figured he was being himself in the sense that he was behavingon his real spiritual level . And he would act out aspects of his dreams of himself . It was in this kind of regular fellow circle that he could win and get the respect and approval that he wanted . Tom was a man , husband , father , small businessman , Christian and churchgoer , hail fellow and regular fellow , responsible , good and decent citizen , but not a blue-nose and a reformer , a democratic sort of a fellow who did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigwigs , a part of the hones of the real and true , the honest-to-Jupiter Christopherbackbone of society . A good American , he was a regular fellowdoing what a man should do , and being what a man should be . And as a boy in his olden , golden short-pants days , he had been a real boy , just as he was a true man . No kid even suspected he had taken violin lessons , walking home and carrying a violin in a violin case every Saturday for a couple of years . But there had n't been the least trace , suggestion , hint that there was any , not the slightest trace even , of the sissy in him . From a real boy , he had grown up into a real regular fellow . Yes , that meant a he-man , as much of a he-man , anyway , as he could be . This was Tom Daniels ' image of himself.  |p178Tom  and Frances Daniels had come to take it for granted that their marriage was much like all others of people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tom was convinced that theirs was a better marriage than most . He had his moments of difficulty , of course , every man in Valley City did , he was sure , and the trouble usually came from the rising up of the Old Adam inside . Fellows of his acquaintance had never said very much about how they felt about the Old Adam in them . They did n't say a lot on the subject of how hard up they got , and some of ' em must get hard up like he did . Nor did they say a lot about how rough the going got when your wife was expecting . Of course , there must be plenty of married men who did go to whorehouses , but he did n't know who they were . He 'd gone himself , sometimes , before he had gotten married , and especially before he 'd begun going with Frances . He 'd only gone two or three times after he 'd met Frances and fallen in love with her , and afterward , he 'd felt worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to describe . It had been hard , yes , hard , to look Frances in the eye becausegoing to a whorehouse and having a whore had seemed like a way of defiling himself , making himself unworthy of her . In those days , she had been so pure , so good , so innocent in his eyes , a virgin who did not know the ways of man and whose heart was untouched by sin , unsoiled by anything dirty . But those days were gone . Days of youth and love . Frances was changed . And he guessed that he must be changed , too . At times ,  |p179he  would look at Frances in such a way that she 'd become kind of nervous and uneasy , and she 'd ask him if something was the matter , and he 'd tell her , no , nothing was the matter while he went dead-pan and innocent . And she 'd say something about the strange and unusualway that he 'd been looking and staring at her , and he 'd stay dead-pan because he could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , he could n't tell her that he 'd been staring because he could n't find in her , Mrs. Frances Daniels , Mrs. Thomas Daniels , the young girl , Frances , the sweetheart of his youth , that old sweetheartof mine , the girl who was so pure and was just somebody dropped right out of Heaven , and who had inspired in him all of those thoughts and feelings that were like poetry and music and songs , thoughts he 'd never have dared admit having , not to any pal of his , and not even to Frances herself . He 'd look at her , filled out a bit , still so fine and handsome a woman , but a woman and not the girl he had loved with all of the best feelings that he had ever had in his whole life . Tom sometimes sat , smoking his pipe and thinking of that time , youth , youth with moonlight , and that poem of James Whitcomb Riley that he was always promising himself he 'd memorize , " An Old Sweetheart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be kind of hard even to begin explaining if he ever had to explain it . He was dreaming in disappointment , dreaming in the melancholy that he felt , looking at the fire licking and crackling the logs and leaping up , and puffing on his pipe , dreaming the dreams that never came true , and never could have come true . Of course , they were only the dreams of puppy love , calf love , but they had lingered with him all through his marriage , and he sometimes , especially on winter nights , liked to remember because he was always wanting to bring back , even if only for so little as five minutes , that wonderful feeling he used to have that everything was wonderful and that everything would go right on being wonderful always , all of the time , because of Frances and because he loved her . But that kind of feeling was gone and gone for good . And love 's old sweet song had been sung and he could not sing it again with the same hopes and feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't lose himself in memory and forget that he was no longer twenty-one , and that he was getting on toward middle age . He could only remember his dreams ; he could n't dream them over again . Regret was most poignant to Tom because he believed that thep180best days of his life were gone , the days of boyhood on up to the time of his marriage and honeymoon . That was the way life was , and you really lived your best years first . Not that you did n't then have any more good years , but you could never feel once again the way you used to when you were still so carefree , and your love was the only love and your girl the only girl and all that sort of stuff . Maybe you had to laugh at yourself , but golly , those had been the days , and you could only be sad just to think how they were gone , getting so far away , and farther away , all of the time . Your dreams did n't come true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't made out of green cheese , no it was n't , and your idol had feet of clay , that is , after a fashion of speaking . You could n't help wanting the impossible , wanting to have it all back again , wanting to live it all over again . It had always been , it always would be like this , and people would always be the same , they would n't change . They would go on , dreaming dreams of happiness that would never come true , and then , looking back on the days of those dreams , the oldengoldendays , and they would be wanting to enjoy again the gold of the olden-golden days . Nothing was as much as you expected it to be or as you remembered it . But , then , all things considered , he and Frances did n't have any serious complaints . They lived well . They were respected by people . They owned a fine , big house . They were , indeed , the envy of some , even of many . Young love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit it to anyone else , but , to be sure , he had to confess to himself that he was disappointed in Frances . He was fully aware of her wonderful virtues and qualities , and she was still a mighty handsome woman . Because he had her as his wife , he was the envy of many men . And he would n't trade her for the wife of anyone he knew . IIe was proud , mighty proud , to have such a woman as Frances for a wife . When he walked into church for services on a Sunday morning , with Frances at his side , he knew that all eyes were on the two of them and he felt set up and proud , mighty proud . And Frances kept the home running smoothly , always clean . She almost never seemed to forget anything important . She got on his tail sometimes , and he did n't like that . No man would . But every man needed a wife who 'd get on his tail sometimes , so long as it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man came anywhere close to being a saint , not if there was any of the regular fellow in his veins . Still , he was disappointed . Yes , sometimes he was.  |p181Considering  that they were man and wife , and that Frances was the mother of his children , he and she did n't seem to be close to each other . Frances had a way of keeping a little distance between them . That was what he thought , often enough . When they were alone together , he did n't always feel as comfortable as he ought to . He would become silent because he could n't always think of anything to say . And whenever he really had anything on his mind that worried or bothered him , he did n't seem to want to talk it over with her . He had a feeling and a kind of fear that she 'd get too bossy and try to wear the pants in the family unless he was mighty careful . And then , if he said anything sentimental , anything that was like the feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitingand they sang , she might tell him not to be silly , after all , he was a grown man and he should n't talk nonsense or be saying foolish things . He guessed that he was a little bit , well , romantic , and that Frances was n't . This was the reason , he guessed , why he was sometimesput-back , a little put-off , or , oh well , why he was disappointed . Tom Daniels was thus never sure about what to do in the performanceof his marital duties , and in putting to Frances the demandsthat were his by right of the fact that he was her husband . It was still mighty often embarrassing to approach her . He could be shy or even ashamed of himself for wanting her , and she would sometimes make him feel that way by the way she might treat him and his desires as a burden she had to bear only because it was her duty to do so , and to cater to him , even if he might be silly . Sometimes , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he 'd be nervous for fear that she might laugh in that way of hers which was more of a giggle than a laugh . There were nights when he could n't help himself , he 'd be so excited and he 'd hesitate and get into a stew with himself because he did n't know how she 'd respond to him and he 'd hesitate , wait , think of how to ask her , of what he 'd say , of how he 'd go to her , kiss and hug her so that she 'd know what he wanted , but he would n't be sure of what he ought to say or do . There he was , a married man and he did n't always know how to approach his wife . But you could n't understand what madep182a woman tick , and he did n't think that Frances was any different from most other women , in this respect . If other husbands did not have this kind of situation , once the newness and the polish was rubbed away from marriage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , sometimes was in the opposite kind of a situation , and there would be nights when he would n't want to perform his marital duties as a husband , but he 'd get to thinking that maybe he ought to because if he did n't want to often enough and on enough nights , then Frances might think he did n't love her any more , or she might not respect him because he was pretty certain that no matter how your wife acted or put you off this time or that time , she would n't respect you as a man if she began to suspect or think that you did n't have much in you in that line of duty . However , Tom Daniels was not as unhappy a man and a husband as he would seem to have been , or as possibly he should have been , living as he did with his wife in such definite sexual disharmony . He was committed to the belief that he was a happy man , and that he and his like were the salt of the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhappy would not only have destroyedthe comforting vanity of this belief ; additionally , it would have been like a confession of failure , almost a deficiency in patriotism . It was a time when the social atmosphere was just about balmy with hope and optimism . Tom was living in the best of all possible worlds , in the greatest , the freest , and the happiest of countries , in the best city and the best state within that country . Men like Tom should have the happiness of a king . He was not one of the corrupt rich nor of the unworthy poor . He was the equal of any man and really the superior of many , of those who were not like him . While there was narrowness and intolerance of religious beliefs in the Valley City of Tom Daniels ' day , there was also neighborliness and friendliness . A spirit of equality prevailed . From back yards , over back-yard fences , from porch-to-porch , on the sidewalk , and at churches , people usually greeted one another and spoke cheerfully with frequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bitter gossip , mean backbiting and intolerant ostracism , but neighborscould also feel liked and respected among their own kind . There was considerable entertaining in the home , where big , solid , very substantial meals were served , and afterward , everyone would sing religious and popular songs which softened up moods andp183brought about a temporary closeness of feelings , sentiments and sentimentalities . The Old Rugged Cross was a standby which usually awakened a self-righteous satisfaction in the good they did while they could worship and still live in comfort . And Silver Threads Among the Gold , and Put On Your Old Gray Bonnet , submerged much of the anticipated pain and the embryonic fear of growing old in a glow of sentimentality and a renewing of the hopes of enduring love , a love which , from the distance of near middle-age , seemed to have filled the vanished days of courtship with a rosy happiness . Conversation in those days , in a circle like that of Tom and Frances Daniels , was usually far from frank when the company was mixed . Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded a " Damn " as daring if one of the fair sex was present . Many attitudes were carefully concealed , while others were expressed obliquely , or in watered words or euphemisms . And often the speaker was completelyunaware that he was using screened language . There was flirting and leering and the voicing of some innuendoes , but in general matters of sex , if not avoided , were touched most carefully and delicately . There was an abundance of wisecracking , teasing , kidding , and joking  --  and the jokes were repeated again and again . Tom Daniels would laugh almost ahead of some of the jokes and gags , and when he let go he did so as heartily as any man . There was a method in Tom 's easily provoked laughter ; he was a jokester himself , and he hoped to get the same as he gave to others who said anything funny . And just as he told the same joke more than once , so could Tom erupt with undiminished hilarity when he heard a joke told for the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom liked to be told by one of the women that he was " the life of the party . " The compliment never came from Frances . Long familiarity had left her dull to Tom 's jokes ; in company , she sometimessmiled or laughed at them , but only for the sake of appearances . And Frances was equally polite to others . She did n't think her friends were really funny enough to provoke the mirth that rocked the high ceilings of the homes where they all gathered . It was a little foolish , but it helped everyone to have a better time and it made the evenings pass in a more friendly , neighborly , and sociable atmosphere . She was n't the only one who smiled or laughed withp184tongue in cheek . Others did the same , and many of the people pretendedthat they were hilarious when they were n't at all . The women were pleasing the men with easy flattery but having their own little joke and laughing at the men among themselves . Tom , poor fish , did n't know this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of humor and were n't blue-noses and killjoys . Because they were churchgoing Methodists and Christians , and believed in the revelations of the Bible , this did n't mean they were n't as human as anyone else or were incapable of enjoying life , and that they did n't know how to have a good time , with good clean fun and laughing . When they could split their sides over a good joke or a funny story , were n't they provinghow human they were and how much fun they were having ? And actually they did have a good time . On most social evenings , it was customary for the men and women to gather into separate groups to talk among themselves . In some houses , the men would gather in the kitchen or remain sitting around the dining-room table . If both groups collected in the parlor , they huddled together at opposite ends of the room . And , of course , the men talked man talk , and the women talked woman talk which , to the men , was mostly incomprehensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ladies , God bless ' em , a man could n't live with ' em and he could n't live without ' em . Port wine was served by the Danielses but this was unusual , an exception . When the men gathered in a separate room , especially the kitchen , Tom Daniels or some other daring but surreptitious sinner might flash a bottle of bourbon , which would be quickly passed around while one of the bold band did sentinel duty . With snickers and grimaces , furtive glances at the door leading to the front of the house , whispered jokes , and mingled feelings of boldness and great apprehension , the men passed the bottle , took a drink and then by expression , gesture or words uttered half under their breath they indicated or expressed smirking satisfaction . But this was followed by a grotesque impatience for the rest of the conspirators to hurry up . Their faces were grave , wearing concentratedexpressions , as though all of them were engaged in a dangerous adventure which required the sharpest alertness . Their efforts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were too frightened and too much concerned with playing out their little melodramatic and conspiratorial skit truly to enjoyp185the bourbon fully . If they had felt no genuine fear , they would have synthesized an atmosphere of alarm anyway . It was the adventure of drinking booze , rather than the booze itself , that was their main source of pleasure . Most of them , in fact , did n't even like it . Living in the historic shadow of the pioneers , some of them the descendants of intrepid men who had come through the Cumberland Gap , of men who had made their way alone to settle in land inhabited by Indians , these descendants were living staid existences , dull , regular , unexciting and without adventure , and they were already falling into middle age . From the pioneer age , and the winning of the West , they had absorbed ideas of what men should be like and what manhoodwas , while as boys , they had grown up , daydreaming of adventures , battles and fights with Indians , and outlaws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and encounters to be bravely and rashly undertaken in defense of the honor and virtue of fair and beautiful maidens . Their youth was gone . In retrospect , it seemed to have swept by with such surprising quickness that they were hurt with amazement by the fleeting disappearance of years they regarded to be the best in the life of a male . Their own lives had been pretty barren of danger and adventure . A few fist fights , a few usually speedy visits of sin with girls of the scarlet profession but with prices that were economical , one or two premarital affairs , one fear that , perhaps , a plumber 's daughter had been knocked up , some youthful binges but mostly mild ones , smoking cigarettes without permission , real ones and others with corn silk in them , and a few filchings of inexpensive articles from stores  --  this was an almost complete catalogue of their adventures . Ever since boyhood there had been dreams of courage , dangerous struggle and fighting , bravery , noble but adventurous enterprises , intrepid explorations and quests for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , devil-may-care shooting and brawling , heroism in battle , bold action which scorned death with a manly calm that was beyond the superb . Now , however , they regarded themselves as mature and responsiblemen . I-Iaving become men , they had presumably put away and even forgotten the things of a boy , but it was n't so : the child indeed was father of the man . Tom or one of the boys always had plenty of sticks of chewing gum or peppermint candy to kill the smell of booze on their breath . Sweetening their breath , the boys would remain in the kitchen , theirp186bellies warmed by the booze , their respectful admiration for their own bravery equalled only by their respect for their cleverness . Meantime , the girls knew all about it . They had not failed to recognize that the boys in the kitchen were quiet as mice and Tom Daniels who was always " the life of the party , " had been muted . Boys , they all tacitly agreed , will be boys . Then at last the girls heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they knew the bottle had been capped and stashed . In the kitchen , within a building cloud of tobacco smoke , the men talked man talk from which the girls were excluded  --  buying and selling , profits , politics , a story heard at secondhand about the mayor , a story Tom Daniels told about his current alderman in words almost identical with those he had used when he had told this same story about the previous alderman . And there were some off-color stories , a joke about an Irishman named Casey , a turkey joke about Murphy , a joke about two more Irishmen , Pat and Mike by name . And a joke about Rastus and a big juicy watermelon , a joke about Sambo and a chicken , a joke about a darkie , variations of the same joke told about Abie , Izzy , and Benny , and various and sundry jokes about traveling salesmen and drummers and a real spicy one about the farmer 's daughter that doubled them all up . " The boys are having a time of it in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the cat 's away , the mice will play . " The girls did n't seem to be having as much fun and they probably were n't . In those days , women of the station in life of Frances Daniels did not engage in as many activities as would their married granddaughtersof a later day and age . Their interests were more limited , and they were less educated . Neither Frances nor any of the other " girls " had gone to college . They had church work as a subject of conversation , and the minister , and the minister 's wife , who dressed too shabbily for her position . It was quite understandable why the minister 's wife , Mrs. Goodhall , was to be seen in church on Sunday morning in such a shabby black silk dress , that looked old , because poor woman , she had almost worn it out , but on a minister 's salary , and with four children to feed , think of it . The Reverend Goodhall had such a look and he talked so that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit . There were a few titters . A minister was a man , and in his home , you could bet he would n't be any different from other men . Yes , poor Mrs. Goodhall , she must have her handsp187full . Why , some days , she just looked so dead tired , with circles underher eyes , and , yes , she looked just dead tired . And if the reason was what you could guess it well could be , a minister of God ought to set an example of the spiritual life . And he was such a mousy man , too . It just went to show . You never could tell for sure what anyone was like . The girls could have pursued this subject further , but they shied away . Two of them became , while not precisely upset , a little nervous and stiff-lipped . If poor Mrs. Goodhall was so worn-out because of what Reverend Goodhall was doing to her at night , this could suggest a good deal about what the boys in the kitchen might or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girls in the parlor . Frances said that she would give Mrs. Goodhall a couple of her dresses which were still in very good condition , and everyone was of the opinion that the wives of ministers could n't be choosers and that Frances was so good , so generous , and it was sweet and thoughtfulof her to do this for poor Mrs. Goodhall . The girls could hear the boys ' laughter . They grew restless as the time passed . They were curious , envious of their husbands . They talked of cooking , recipes , their children , their homes , food prices , but mainly in order to kill the silence . As they carried forth their random conversation , one or another cocked an ear , alert for the drift of what was going on among the boys in the kitchen . It was time for singing . The girls were restive ; four of the girls were about to stamp into the kitchen and ask their husbands in no uncertain terms to join their wives , when the six boys re-invaded the parlor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them was over thirty-four . But they seemed neither young nor old . They were six unattractive men of indefinite age  --  settled and uninteresting men . Their countenanceswere assuming a cast of smugness and satisfaction . Their faces , so varying in formation , were not quite dead , nor were they lively in any expressive way . They were monotonous , unglowing , vaguely contemptuous and they showed the subtle weakness of contourof men who have attained their peak at the dead center of mediocrity.  |p188When  Tom had walked into the room , Frances recognized that his head was swelling up like a lump that was growing fast . The sight depressed her . In his own mind , he 'd no doubt been patting himself on the back , and he expected everyone else present to think his sudden swelled head was its real size . And why ? Because he and the boys had had a couple of drinks , and had told some coarse stories , dirty stories . And the rest of the men were the same , coming into the parlor like popinjays but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously never entered the mind of any one of them . The whole picture weighed her down . How could she ever let him touch her again ? She shuddered at the thought . The men were toning down a little , and everybody wanted to sing . She wanted to sing . Singing was the heart of these parties . That 's what everybody enjoyed . All her life , she had loved the singing when there was a party or when people had dropped in . The six husbands had all gradually become more like their ordinary selves . Frances idly touched the piano keys , played a note here or there , ran off a few notes , and then with her slender and just-nicely-long , finely formed hands she played a bar . Her hands had such a lovely white texture of skin that they could not escape notice . And they did n't . There were fixed stares at her hands , especially from men who became entranced . The fineness and close to pure white coloring of her skin was as rare as it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upright Wurlitzer piano a quick change of mood became evident . Everyone rose to form a group around the piano . The joking and laughing and the conversation had all been rubbed very thin . It was high time to start the singing . And followingupon so much talk , a-body felt all talked out , especially when a-body was with friends and neighbors who knew almost everything there was to be known about one another . Everybody knew pretty much what everybody else was going to say . There was no better way to end an evening than to gather togetheraround the piano and sing songs that put everybody in the best spirits . The happy times of days gone by came back in memories that the songs awakened . The songs said so many things that a-body could n't say for oneself and they reminded a-body of beautiful things in life . All of those feelings and hopes that could never come truep189but made for the fineness of life , and those feelings of sadness for days gone by that could come no more . The songs made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They began with The Old Rugged Cross , and they sang with a smiling lightness of spirit which they would have regarded as disrespectfulof the Lord and at least verging on sin , should they have sung in the same carefree mood at church services . It was fun , and even something of a harmless joke to sing The Old Rugged Cross , gathered behind Frances Daniels at the piano in her living room . But they sang better than in church , without dragging the tune in heavy piety or with the falsity of simulated joy . They were arch and merry as they sang this old standby , familiar to them from their earliest years , so familiar its meaning had been scraped to dullness . There were stirrings of pride , and Tom , as well as a few of the guests , lifted his voice , following Frances ' swifter tempo , renderingthe song as though it had no religious connotations . They wished that they could actually see and touch the cross . They knew that it , standing with the hard strength of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their church , and it stood for God 's own truths . Tom 's voice lifted above all others . His face was lively with joy . Lax as he 'd often been about religion , sinner that he was , that same Old Rugged Cross stood for the most important things in the world and in his own life . He sang with belief because he was glad and grateful , proud and happy , lucky and fortunate ; he was a specially favored man because he lived in faith before and in the shadow of that same Old Rugged Cross , and during his whole life , he had been a member of the church of that same Old Rugged Cross . Frances and all of his guests were his brothers and sisters before the greatest thing in the world , the Old Rugged Cross . He was warm with a sense of kinship . Tom and Frances , who bathed in a pleasant belief in her importanceas the one who played the piano , and all of the guests had gone through a quick change of moods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen . They knew the experience ; they had often gathered round a piano together , and they had come to respond together . The mere act of singing , itself , afforded pleasure , a feeling of release , some expression of oneself . And just as backbiting and gossipcould be a source of enjoyment , so could friendliness and thep190exchange of rich , creamy compliments , the relaxation of one 's guard , and the indulgence in sentimentality . They were a homogeneous group of people with many similarities in experiences and feelings , stretching all the way back to their early childhood . Even though much of their inner selves remained protectedand concealed , they had a strong awareness of their own kind . And they were convinced that America had no better than their own kind . They expected to be well-liked , and to be held in high regard , in their belief that they , their likes , their kind formed the solid human foundations which made the edifice of the United States of America the very greatest in the world , the very greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which drilled fear of their instincts into the basis and bottom of their beings , also hammered into them a self-righteous pride , a conceited assurance of moral superiority , and a hardened pride that the Word , final and unchangeable , had been given unto their kind . Even though they were sinful , as all men were , they were still the best , the Lord 's pick and choice among all of humanity . Their beliefs , attitudes , and prejudices were a crowd of inconsistencies and contradictions , but they were happy in their blindness to their own muddle . They believed like gospel that they need take second place to none in their belief in freedom and democracy and the equality of all men . When they sang , they sang robustly from a strong sense of their own virtue and superiority . They sang for almost an hour , covering just about the entire range of songs they knew . They did not sing well together , and all of them were not good singers . On almost every song , someone was out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not harmonize . But this was only of minor import , and produced but a few mild jokes . Tom kept singing off-key , and at times , his voice rose as though it might drown out the voices of everyone else . Tom had a powerful voice , especially considering that he was a thin , little man . Remarks and compliments about his voice pleased him enormously , but so did any compliment , and he responded to all compliments with more than becoming modesty . " The Lord gave it to me , " he said when he was praised for the power of his voice . " Might as well give full use to what the Lord gave me . " But Tom only let loose every now and then . He was , as much as anyone , emotionally and sentimentally stirred by many of the songs . Restraining his voice , and even singing quietly , softly , he becamep191enveloped in his moods , his yearnings and the nostalgic reawakeningof memories . The past and his various yesterdays had not disappearedlike smoke or vapor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embedded somewhere in the world or even in many places . The past and his various yesterdays had not died . While they sang Sweet Genevieve , Tom thought of how once this song had been full of all of his welled-up feelings of love for Frances . Tom 's illusion changed into disbelief of the fact that bygone days were bygone . He was singing this song as he had used to sing it before his hair had begun to recede and grow thin and before Frances had become plump with the ripening years of her wifehood and of her motherhood . Frances was still his Genevieve , and their love was still young as they were young , and he was singing Genevieveas he had used to sing it , staring at her with eyes made mute by love , staring at her transfixed , staring at the gentle curve of her chin , staring at the shining softness of her puffs of blond hair , staring at the starchy blue polka-dot summer dress she wore , staring at her for all that she then was , a girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as flowers bloom . He gazed past fat Tommy Bennett , who had once been a slim , well-built fellow , and , with hungry hope , he sought in Frances , full , mature , ripe and somewhat Brunnehildean , the girl that she once had been . It could n't be that Frances had changed . But she had . His illusion was gone like a scrap of paper blown away out of sight by a swift wind . He was sad with disappointment in Frances . But he , also , was changed . Genevieve and the days may come and the days may go , but Genevieve was the Frances of yesterday , of his love 's young dream . But the song had restored the memory of his love 's young dream . The sadness of his disappointment was diluted by the fast flow of his memories . The whole time when he had courted Frances and had won her consent and then had been the lucky beau who had won her heart  --  it had been the time of the happy , happy times of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the feeling that he was just about walking on air , and living in the clouds . And , my God , he could n't even have begun to believe that any fair swain and lover , from Romeo up and down all the scales , had ever been or could ever be as happy as Tom Daniels . If only he were singing back in those days instead of now , years later . Riding in a buggy withp192Frances , and feeling himself the man and the luckiest of men with his head held prouder than a whole barnyard full of peacocks preeningtheir feathers in a full dress parade  --  my God , he 'd just about thought that he himself , alone , was just about the only man on top of the world . The other five men were close to Tom in mood . They , also , were singing out of the youth which was polished to a glitter by memory . Their youth had not been quite Homeric , nor had the girls whom they sparked and courted and hugged and kissed ever threatened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mid-West . Nevertheless , these days seemed in moody retrospect , to have been the best of their whole lives . They grew softer and softer until their minds were like wet sponges , sopping with the sentimentalities . In other and less sentimental moments , they might laugh , or pretend to laugh at their own yearnings , but right now the hard shell of their masculinity had been cracked open and inside there was squashed and mushy softness . They enjoyed this . They were enjoying their moony yearnings , their remembered and restored feelings of calf love , their sighing regrets for those good old days gone by , when it was wonderful and Heavenly , and she had worn a bonnet and he 'd worn a red , red rose or even a red , red , red rose . They liked to sing because they all wanted and needed this indulgencein feelings and sentiments , even in a mush of sentimentalities . They wanted to feel again what they had once felt and , also , to feel what they had never felt and more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreams of love , which had been worn down and washed of glow . The fresh new glow belonged to these dreams only once upon a time , at the beginning of love in days of youth . They could feel more close than usual in spirit and memory , in the sharing of something of one another 's feelings through the common medium of the songs . Other songs also were sung , Casey Jones and Solomon Levi , Tentingon the Old Camp Ground , and they wound up with Home , Sweet Home . They broke up smiling , and happy , full of friendly feeling for one another , talking and laughing , joking , and much pleased with the thought that a good time was had by all.  |p193Tom  Daniels , on almost all such evenings , wanted Frances with a mooniness that bordered on pathos . On some nights , like these , the intensity of sexual desire made him shake and throb because the Old Adam in himself was just about beyond control . Tom would hug and kiss Frances with a hungry passion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clumsily . He was like a man enslaved by a commanding compulsion . The tension within him seemed to harden his muscle and to endowhim with a momentary strength of which he was normally incapable . He would lock Frances in an embrace so tight that she would be hurt and bruised . He would press and crush her to himself to the point where she would gasp in pain . Frances had come to expect such scenes , and to dread them . But , nevertheless , Tom often would startle , dumfound her , leave her truly stunned . She could never become wholly accustomed to this kind of behavior on his part . Tom , frenzied with untamed instincts , grabbed and grasped at her wildly , and , oh , with such crudity and vulgarity . His coarse advances embarrassed her , shamed her , left her cold . But after weakly protesting , she would submit to him in a spirit of wifely duty and with the hope that the act would end very quickly . She sometimes simulated passion , but it was rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her submission was of body only , not of the spirit . She fulfilled an unpleasant duty , but since it was a duty , she did not feel soiled or degraded . Thus , her pride and self-esteem were saved.  |p194Tom  , in his overwrought excitement , would babble and murmur that he loved her , and would ask , sobbingly , if she loved him . She would whisper that she did , but Frances could not regard union under these circumstances as any demonstration of love . She was being used merely as a vessel of pleasure for a man and only God 's sanction of this intercourse between a husband and wife gave it any justification . It was ugly and should be done in darkness because darkness would hide its shame . It roused in men , and in women , too , desires which could lower them to the level of animals , beasts of the field . It was justified , yes , only because of the Will of God and for the purposes of God . It was God 's way of bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would suffer the punishment and know the sorrow of Eve who had fallen with Adam . It could give joy , ecstasy , moments of dreamlike happiness . It could play upon all that was tender and loving in a woman 's , and , sometimes , in a man 's nature , too . But , also , it could be coarse , crude , vulgar , coarse , vulgar , coarse . Tom , once finished , would roll away to his side of the bed , drawing away so that no part of his body touched hers . He would fall quickly into exhausted sleep . And Frances would lie awake , with drowsiness slowly penetrating her mind like a steady infiltrating and darkening twilight . Her body , used by Tom , went slack and limp . A soothing weariness lulled her into sleep . Sometimes , as night was ending in a blank of time , Frances would remember snatches of familiar songs . Through her sleepiness , there came awakened reminders of days , and years of innocence that could never come back . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember dreams that could never come true , when she had been all expectation waiting for them to come true . Plain sad to remember her happy , and girlish beliefs about the wonderfulness of those days . It was impossible now for her ever again to feel happiness through false dreams , like those of the gushing , laughing , hoping , dreaming days of her girlhood . Tom , and many of her guests , had sung the songs of yesterday as though they wished that they could dare to cry . She knew Tom , and , also , the others well enough to know that they still wanted to believe and hope that all of the stuff and nonsense of that time of life could be more than stuff and nonsense . This was silly . She enjoyed the songs because she was able to rise above the sadness of memoryp195which they brought to her , and because she was smiling and laughing with herself and Tom , and smiling , also , at the others , singing as theydid with aching hearts because they had lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon . The moon was n't made of green cheese . She was able to feel sad because the moon was n't cheese and , then , to put her sadness away out of mind . Frances believed with force of certainty that Tom 's bullishness in going at her was an aftereffect of the song session . He wanted fornication to provide him the love that he must have dreamed of as wonderful moonshine . He wanted to do something like fornicate herand imagine that she was a lady of the moon . But instead of beingtender and soft as he used to be when he would take her out in a canoe on June nights , he turned into a bear and fornicated her as if she might be a she-grizzly instead of a woman , a Christian woman . He wore himself out and fell asleep with his strength used up . She had gotten what strength he had . She was stronger than Tom . There was a certain compensation in this thought . Frances was not wrong about Tom . His passion had been whipped into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he would feel everything , the biggest moment of his life . He had been overcomeby a rage to take Frances in full and uninhibited ravishment , and as no woman had ever been taken before ; he had wanted to have her as though he owned her body and could make it and all of her the slave of his power and will . He wanted to find in her a fulfillment of all of his vague longings , yearnings , and dreams of love  --  dreams that had lingered with him ever since his first , callow imaginings of the joy and happiness of love and how it would make you feel like the dawn , the silvery moonlight , the twinkling and shining stars , the sensuous languor and fresh new greenness of a spring day , like all of the beauty of the world . In lust , he had sought what he regarded as beauty ; in beauty he had desired lust . And he was ashamed of the very things he sought . As a regular fellow among regular fellows , he knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was n't one of those poets who never did a good day 's lick of work and probably never smoked a Piedmont or another cigarette in his shirt sleeves inp196the kitchen . A red-blooded he-man laughed at any fellow who was full of gush and moony thoughts and even thought such a fellow was balmy . Tom apologized to himself whenever he had these soft thoughts and feelings , except when he was singing . And even though he might talk big , wink and hint and exaggerate a little when he was with other men , he dreaded lust as a sin . It was in a man because it was the beast in man , the Old Adam , nature , human nature . After you reached a certain age and no longer had pimples and blackheads all over your face , you could n't keep that Old Adam asleep because it would n't stay that way , but was always rearing up and once it did , you felt mighty uncomfortable and then something unless that Old Adam got what it needed . The women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them were tender as a flower . They had to love a man and be married before they wanted to play Eve to that Old Adam . And even then , you 'd sometimes find that if a man was a man and really liked to give the Old Adam a frolic , the little woman might think it was nasty and you were just a beast . And the other kind , the ones who liked it and would give themselves away cheap to a fellow or a lot of men , they were no good , and most of ' em were n't fit company for decent women , a man 's mother , or wife or sister . As low as whores , they were . A man being what he was would naturally take what any of these women were ready to give him , so long as he did n't think it would get him into trouble , especially if he was married . And even then , some fellows he knew took chances you 'd never find him taking , not because he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasures or rewards . What established and happily married man with any horse sense was going to take a big risk over some trollop or hussy . Some of the gals who had lost their reputation lying on the flat of their backs were , well , they were good for what they were good for . They did n't have any shyness or hesitation about them and did n't care what they did , and a man being what he was , and like what he was like , he enjoyed that sort of a good time . Sometimes , it changed his luck , that kind of a good time , he meant . Men were different from women , that is , from the decent ones . A man could do things a woman could n't , not if she valued herself , and her standing in the community and she had real self-respect . And a man felt freer with the trollops than he did with his own wife . You loved your wife , and respected her . It did n't matter what a man did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as the trollops would go , and , of course , a fellow should n't do it , but that was the way a man was made by nature . Of course , a go with your missus was n't wrong , but that was differentthan a time of it with some trollop or whore . After all you loved your wife and respected her , and she was the mother of your children , or that was what she was going to be . If you went too far and you just had , well , say you just had lust with your missus , you could feel low , and depraved , rotten as the Devil 's brother in Hell , and maybe even ashamed to look her in the eye . And how was any man going to feel if he went too far , and it was always , or most of the time , well , say it was lust with his wife , and she was the mother of his daughter or even daughters . And still a man , well , the Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tom Daniels . The Old Adam indeed would not leave Tom Daniels with an easy mind and a quiet conscience . Tom wanted safe experiences with trollops and whores , and he had many lustful and lurid but wholly imaginary experiences with such women who , had they been real rather than imagined , would not have been fit company for Frances or for other decent women . Not on every day , and most certainly not on Sundays , did Tom wake up and see his Briinnehildean wife , and hope that as a consequence of some happening of good fortune , he would meet a woman who , while unfit to be seen walking along the street with Frances , would be more than fit to get into a bed with him , to go lustfully to all of the limits with him , also . Frequently , he hoped and imagined that the trollop he 'd meet would be a young widow or a grass widow . A grass widow might be the easiest and best skirt full of luck for him because it was n't very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the memory of a dead husband , if trollop she should be . And better than a grass widow who was already a trollop would be one who was ready to become such , one who had been divorced and alone for a long enough time so that she would be wanting a man . While a grass widow could be the best and easiest bet , a bonap198fide , honest-to-gee-whillikins widow who had put her weeds in moth balls for a respectable period of time was n't at all unlikely or improbable . Other men had met genuine widows , widows whose husbandshad received a decent burial , and these widows had not pined themselves into hypochondria , nervous headaches , or consumption and remained faithful to the memory of their dearly beloved but departedspouses . To the contrary , they had allowed themselves to be lusted after by men , and they had lusted after men , and then , they had lustfully turned lusting into lust . Tad Hanley a year or so earlier had bragged about a redheaded armful of a widow who had come into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she needed a shelf over her kitchen sink . She had then spoken of her helplessness because , as her black mourning clothes had revealed , she had lost her dear and loving husband to the Lord . And she had made eyes at Tad , but with no tears in them . Well , Tad had just agreed to play Sir Walter Raleigh to the redheaded lady who was supposed to be bereaved and in distress . And according to Tad , he had done more than put up a shelf over the kitchen sink and she had removed her weeds , and then all of the unseen underneath the weeds and she had wanted Tad to do some things in her bedroom . According to his description and account , Tad had done the duty of a gentleman by gallantly performing for the bereaved lady with the red hair , every service of which she was in need , and a few extra ones which were pleasing to her and brought smiles on a face which had known and shown the sorrows of loss , and the sadness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and heavy , too , but , then again , maybe he was n't . Tom , and Bill Dalton , who sold insurance and a good deal of it , too , and a few other fellows knew for a fact that Tad Hanley used to commit the sin of adultery with the chestnut-haired and buxom sister of a blacksmith by the name of Tim Mahan , and the chestnut-haired one had had about as neat an ankle as any ankle to be seen in Valley City . Tad did n't have a way with the women , Bill Dalton always said ; Tad had many ways with ' em . And he also got away with his many ways on Mable , his blue-eyed missus . She gazed at him with such blue eyes of devotion and adoration , especially when he called her " Baby Doll , " which he most always did . And Mable was quite a doll , but then , Tom Daniels had no need to envy Tad Hanley on that score . Mable could n't hold a candle to a woman as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Mable did n't know about her husband . Tad had proven that widows , grass and genuine , were far from the only possible skirts available for lust , sin , and adultery . But then , this was a widely known fact which needed no proof . Tom knew it , and his hopes were not exclusively fixed on widows of the two categories . He merely hoped for a widow because this could well be his easiest bet . What he wanted was a woman , young enough , pretty enough , preferably buxom , who would want and would return lust for lust . If the creature of lust , the Jezebel , he should find , happened to own her own home , located in a quiet , lonely , and scarcely populated neighborhood where Tom was n't known from Adam or Tad Hanley , why nothing could have been finer , more convenient and all around swell than that . And if only Satan had been more go-getting , and had helped Tom to find a temptress of evil ways with all that Tom desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have tempted Tom , then Satan would have been better than an even-money bet to nab Tom 's soul for the flames of perdition . But Satan placed no tempting trollops or sinful widows in Tom 's path . Tom persisted in dreaming his dreams and hoping his hopes of lust , but these never came true . He had been bold enough to win the hand and heart of Frances but he was not bold enough to go looking for a woman with whom he could cheat on Frances . More than once , he thought of going to a prostitute and he filled his mind with new dreams and hopes of lust . Several times , he almost went , but he never did go . His dreams and hopes continued as such for a couple of years . Then , he planned and went with two friends on a trip to Louisville to see the Kentucky Derby . The prospect of seeing the classic horse race excited him but not as much as that of finding a woman with whom he could lust . And on one evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that he got stewed to his gills on bourbon whiskey , passed out and his friends dumped him fully clothed in bed in his hotel . That had been Tom 's biggest chance but he 'd drunk it away on good Kentucky bourbon . Tom had all of the opportunity he needed in Valley City , but he was intimidated by the inhibitions which had been controlling him during the course of his life . He was afraid that Frances might find out if he took up with another woman . But he was more afraid of himself . If he did get hold of a trollop or a whore , how could he be sure of what he 'd do afterward ? Would he be able to look Francesp200in the eye ? Would he give himself away , rouse up her suspicions and give her the idea he 'd done something ? Would he give himself away ? And Tom was most afraid of vague dangers and consequences which might befall him if he were to gratify his lust in adultery . His fear was of punishment , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a guilty conscience . Adultery was a dirty word to him . It had meant something dirty , filthy , sinful . Those who committedadultery had been described as vile , low , no better than the beasts of the field . Their sin was the most hideous of all , and for it , they paid the wages of sin which was death . They became wretched and miserable , often ill and ruined in body and mind as well as doomed to suffer burning torments and tortures among the damned and howling souls who became the Devil 's own in Hell . Adultery could even result in the catching of a dreadful and hideous disease , which caused sores as ugly as those of a leper , and which , also , rotted the mind as well as the body . But even when adultery had been condemned as the most hideous and monstrous of sins , and the fall and punishment of adulterers had been described as most frightful and horrible , this act had also been made lurid and fascinating . While still wearing short pants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightened when the Reverend Markey , since deceased , had used to get rip-roaring against adultery and against those who were so low , so vile , so foul as to commit this dirty sin . Later on , even after he had become a married man , a sermonabout adultery or some references to it in a sermon , still excitedTom . Sexual desires woke up fast and prompted the wish that he could have some adultery , himself . Images of naked women , of naked bodies tangled together formed in his mind in his imaginary commissions of this sin . He would see himself embracing and kissing , fornicating , and having a good wallow in adultery . When he was a boy and adolescent , the sermons set fire to his prurient curiosity and he burned up with the sins he wanted to commit . These had been magnified in their allurement because they were forbidden and because he had not then committed any such sin . He had had visions of himself doing this . He constantly asked himselfhow it really was done . He wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time . He imagined the first time with a girl named Florence Kane . She had a reputation for giving it away . He tingled . The roaring words of Reverend Markev became indistinct . He heard their sound without listening . He saw himself and Florencep201Kane in the darkness of the Daniels ' basement . He was possessed by his dream . The Reverend Markey , bald-headed , and with angry gloom on his long , sallow face was the cynosure of the scene in the wooden church whose walls were clean and bright with white paint . The brethren in the pews gazed at him , fixed in intensity . They made very few of the little , and often unconscious and purely reflex , movements so characteristic of people who must sit and listen . The members of the congregation , or certainly the majority of them , were responding to the parson 's well-practiced and spellbinding condemnation of the besmirching , degrading , befouling , hideous , and bestial sins of the flesh which he characterized and described as those sins of the body which smear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , condemnto the deepest pits of Hell , all of these men and women who were made to be pure and noble because they are God 's creatures . The parson , his face seemingly more glum and irredeemably morose than the foul sins of lust , held the brethren almost electrically tense . And young Tom Daniels sat almost on the edge of the bench or pew , with his nerves in coiled tension , and his mind almost blissfullydistorted by an illusion more powerful in effect than alcohol . Suddenly , as Tom imagined himself just about to do it with Florence Kane in the darkness of his basement , and with his mind beginning to float and seemingly to dissolve in a sweetness of blissful , ecstatic , and drugged dreaminess , his cheeks got warm and nearly hot and they flushed with the pale and pallid pink of a big , a distressing , and a dream-destroying blush . He was embarrassed . Then , he became ashamed of himself . He could feel how warm his cheeks were . He believed and feared that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redder than the red flames of the fires of Hell . He imagined that everyone in church , including his father and mother on his left , saw how he was blushing and that they knew why , too . He felt trapped with his soul naked before everyone . He could n't run away . He could n't become invisible . He could n't fall through the floor . Inwardly , he writhed in shame . He was full of lust , and all of them , they knew it . Reverend Markey was heaping coals on him as much as on any sinner , and he felt that he might even be a monster , anyway , pretty nearly one . And so Reverend Markey did his bit to help Tom Daniels appreciatesex.  |p202Tom  believed that several of Frances ' pregnancies began on nights when there had been singing and the Old Adam in him had risen up with the lust of a caveman . But if that was when he turned the trick , there should be no cause for him to have any qualms or to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or even look himselfstraight in the face in the bathroom mirror . Only thing was , after he went at it that way , he 'd have his rotten moments , when he 'd feel that he 'd lost all of his self-respect and that he 'd gone at Frances and treated her like he had no respect for her , either . He 'd feel low , low as a snake , and worse than a skunk . In his own eyes , he had abandoned himself , his soul , his spirit . He would tighten up in shame . It had all been worse than sin . When you sinned , you could repent , be prayed for and find hope and forgetfulness in the possibility that your sins might be washed away . But he had sacrificed all dignity and self-respect . Instead of remaining the man who powerfullymastered his woman , he had come close to conducting himself like someone who might have been about to go into a fit of St. Vitus 's dance . But still , it could n't he a sin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife in physical conjugation which could mean begettingas Adam and Eve conjoined to beget , that was no sin and the Bible said that it was n't a sin to fornicate in wedlock in order that men might beget , increase and multiply , by the Will of God . It was the duty of Eve to conceive children in pain and to bow to the desire of her husband . But the Book of Genesis did n't prove to be an authority persuasivep203enough to silence the inner voice of Tom Daniels ' conscience . His guilt was stronger because he also was proud of himself on account of the way that he had made love to Frances . It had been like a conquest of her , and , also , a punishment . He had made her feel the strength of a man . That was what a woman wanted and needed if you expected to win her respect and love . He had to do it as if he could hurt her . And on those nights when the lust controlled him , his gratification was , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their gluttony . No , it was even greater , more complete , and more intense than that . In the madness and wildness of lust when he was forced and when he , also , forced himself to come to that moment of blinding thrill , he 'd imagine that he could repeat and repeat this during the whole night . But the end or climax would come quickly , far-too-quickly . Tom would gasp tiredly , feel content with a sense of exhaustion , and his mind would turn blank . His desires were all quenched and dead . He wanted no more . As a heaviness grew in his brain , thoughts came in slow , drowsy emergence . His disappointment and disillusionment began , but , as the weight of drowsiness increased , sleep , sweet and dreamy , would slowly cloud over his disappointment and disillusionment . But the next morning and on through the day , he would suffer his moral hangover . His self-esteem , which had been deliriously fed and swollen while he had been doing it with Frances , would become shrunken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known to no one but himself , he would hope that he had made Frances pregnant . There were other times when Tom would have sex with Frances , and he did not pay such a penalty of moral torment . His need had provoked desire but with less intensity , or else he had felt , after severalsexless nights , that it was his duty to want her and that if he did n't , she might think less of him as a man , and , then , she might begin to suspect that he no longer loved her . And from suspecting something to believing it , that was hardly more than an easy kind of hop , skip , and jump . His pleasure was less than it ought to be . Sometimesthere was scarcely any enjoyment at all . The act between them would be casual , one of the things that a man and a woman do out of habit after they have settled down together in married life . He had not been lustful , not according to what lust meant to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not think much about it . He might feel somewhat like a chronic drunkard , who has safelyp204managed to stow away a few slugs of booze without having gone on swilling until he was again soaked and soused . But he always had at least some tremors of guilt and self-disgust . Or he might be disappointed in Frances in this particular respect , in the lust of the flesh . He would blame her because of the unsatisfying night before , and he might then , want , yearn for , and daydream about the frantic lust even though it brought him so much anguish when he did give way to it . Or he might fear that he was n't at all the man he wished he were , or that he once had been , and he might even become prey to the paralyzing dread that he had begun to dry up and might be facing a future in which he could n't be able to rise up and perform as a man should perform . Whenever Frances told Tom that she was in the family way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and happiness , too much enthusiasm , too many grins , too much exaltation . He gave the impression of excessive vanity ; he became comic . While ostensibly spontaneous , this conduct could more aptly be described as automatic . Because he had been a creature of lust , he had put his soul into a trap . Frances had sprung the trap by telling him that she was expecting . He was made free from his secret shame . He became happy like a reformed drunkard . He was like a criminal who had paid his debt to society and could fully realize his freedom and walk unhinderedthrough the freedom of golden floods of sunshine . He was as a sinner truly washed in the Blood of the Lamb . He was captivatedby the spell of the illusion that he had become a new man  --  shame buried and pride given back . The prospect of fatherhood was of secondary importance . Frances raised and reared the children , and she wielded the authority over them . If Tom performed the role of punishing father , if he spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enforcing agent of the law within the domestic walls , he did so because Frances wanted him to do so . He went through the motions of doing what he was supposed to do . He enjoyed his children for show the same as he did his wife . Whenever he was distressed or severely troubled by anything , as he was because of his lust , he would blame life , the world , Frances , and sometimes , even himself . But when he blamed , when he was resent/ful , it was without any strong emotional force and intensity . Except for those associated with his lustful desires , Tom Daniels did not have strong feelings . He would become disgruntled about the roles he played , or his home , or the kids , or about any inconveniences or difficulty that he encountered , but these were but the opposite of the constant and undue satisfaction that he tried to take out of petty and passing little matters of life . He was conceited and vain , and he was endlessly trying to enjoy what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Much of the time , he regarded himself to be a very happy and fortunate man , and he had seduced himself into believing that the public image of himself which he strove to create , was the real and true Tom Daniels . And that image was one of Tom Daniels , the regular , jolly good fellow.  |p206Frances  Daniels could understand a great deal that was beyond Tom 's own comprehension . To her , Tom was pretty much like the great majority of men . He was incapable of really understanding a woman . He was more of a child than an adult . He could n't be trusted very far from sight . He was easily fooled and managed , and he was full of many little vanities and conceits . Once he was well managed , however , a man could be more trusted , because then he 'd do pretty much what a woman wanted him to do , even when he was out of her sight . The men who were different from Tom and the general run were dangerous . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a slave , even a willing slave . They could tear her soul apart with love and passion . Frances was attracted to such men from a distance . But she feared them , and sometimes she was angered by them or antagonistic toward them . She always got pleasure out of seeing such men bested . No woman with anv strength of character would marry such a man , or at least not unless she were certain beforehand that she had clipped his wings well and for good . As a girl , Frances had gone out with young men who were bolder than Tom , stronger and more forceful than he . They had been betterlooking , and more attractive in lots of ways . One young man had almost overwhelmed her in a buggy , almost brought her to the point of surrender . As a consequence , Frances had been disturbed and frightened by her own feelings and passion . He had been a tall , handsome young man , Jack Pearson , dark andp207with an appeal that girls found magnetic . Frances had beaten the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had taken Jack Pearson away from Mary Belle Evans , a very pretty flirt whose father had far more money than Frances 's . Having won Jack Pearson away from Mary Belle , Frances enjoyed the sweetness of victory to the full . Frances had given proof that she could , with ease , win the most desired of catches . It had been almost as easy as it was to lift up a glass of water and take a sip . She came to know that she possessed feminine appeal , and a power to captivate as even Cleopatra might have had . In winning Jack Pearson away from Mary Belle Evans , Frances had broken up the most talked of and inevitably " right " romance in the social circles that she knew . She had gained success at what a young girl was supposed to be successful at , and she had won by scarcely more than a soft glance across a parlor , by a quick movement of the lips which was only the suggestion , the beginning of a smile , and , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her carriage , her presence . She knew fully the confident haughtiness that was a reward of victory . And she even enjoyed this with feelings of cruelty . She thought of and imagined Mary Belle Evans alone in her room , sobbing over the humiliation and shame of losing Jack Pearson . Not only was Jack Pearson handsome and possessed of so strong and hypnotizing a physical appeal but , more , he was destined to be a very rich man . His father was piling up a new fortune in successful speculations on wheat downtown in the Board of Trade building , on Marathon Street . And Frances was far from being unmindful of all of the advantages , and the prospects of future splendor that would be hers , were she to become the bride of Jack Pearson . She wanted this to be . She dreamed of it . She began planning to become Mrs. Jack Pearson . It was on a spring evening with a full moon . The shining atmospherewas as though impregnated with the urge to love . Handsome , and handsomely dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close , with his young maleness like a sexual center of gravity , Jack Pearson had taken Frances driving in a brand-new andp208elegant carriage . He had stopped the horses and dropped the weight in a small clearing overlooking the Blue River , which flowed through the southeastern edge of Valley City . It was a night that girls could dream about as the evening on which they would first know and feel love , and they would swoon with all of the joys and wonders that a lover would bestow upon them by his first embraces , and his first kisses . Frances had often imagined that love , when it really and truly did happen , would come on such a night , and in the spring , too , under a full moon , and with the silver moonlight shining like magic  --  and with magic effects on her . Her feeling about the moon and the moonlight , and about the sky and the beauty of the night would all become part of her feelings of love and would make her feel a kind of beauty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped to make her feel more tender , and want to kiss and be kissed . A drowsy sensualness in the fragrant air had worked upon her , inducing languorousfeelings and the wish to fall back languorously into his arms and , oh , to be kissed and caressed and oh , to have anything wonderful happen to her and to be done to her . She had noticed the stars and how there were so many of them out , shining , like jewels they were shining , and the moon , it was so silver , and it was perfectly round , like a silver plate , and the moonlight shining on the streets , on trees , shining ahead of her , and she hoped the moon was shining on her , on her face and that he would sec her face , more beautiful than it had ever been , lighting it in such a way that hers would be the most beautiful face Jack Pearson had ever seen . She felt the night , and she smelled it , too , and she felt it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving along , through streets to the river and along the Blue River , and Jack Pearson had slowed down the horses from a trot to a walk , the spring night had worked its magic upon Frances to the full . She took the night for granted . It was there , all around her , she was in it . She liked the soft touch of the wind on her cheeks ; the wind was sort of petting her face and her cheeks . That was what she wanted Jack Pearson to do . It was in him that there was magic ; it was really magnetism . And he was only inches from her . If his arm brushed against her , if his coat sleeve as much as touched her for only the quickest touch , she tingled , she tingled all over . Almost all , almost every inch of her skin must have become as tender as the skin on her breasts and if he wouldp209only touch her , touch her skin , he 'd do something to her nerves , he 'd make her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was n't swooning as she had imagined she would , becoming dizzy until she was almost fainting . It was something else , different . It was excitement , hot excitement , and her blood was rushing faster in her veins , her nerves ready to quiver and shake , and her cheeks flushing hot , and her heart going in a fast pitter-patter . And the heat between her legs so that she was ashamed and , still , she was n't ashamed at all . The excitement in her was wonderful , and oh , it almosthurt . She moved her legs because she had to , and then , she pressed them together tight , tighter , and if she talked , she 'd gasp , and she wanted him to do something , quick , kiss her , hold her , make her feel him anywhere , everywhere . Something was going to happen , it had to and oh , God , she 'd scream , she 'd beg him , she was helpless , helpless , and she wanted to fall back and surrender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrender so that she could go on and on with all of the excitement in her , on and on until he would do something to her , take her and possess her and even hurt her and make her feel until all of this excitement in her and , oh , this , this wonderful wanting , this wonderful wonderfulness would break and explode in her like bombs full of joy and happiness , and all of the center of her would be like tender nerves shaking and thrilling her whole body and all of her would be delicious . Then , she would be quiet and a warm and sweet deliciousness would flow through her and her nerves , and her nerves and her flesh and all of the center of her that made her a woman would feel like the sweetest , sweetest dream . Frances was silent . She dared not speak . She could n't speak . She was hot and trembling and it was all she could do to keep herself from moaning . She was craving for his lips and the touch of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body was hungry . Jack Pearson had pulled the reins . He had dropped the stone weight . He was affected by the radiance and lavish shimmer of the April night , by the fragrance of the air , and by the seductive appeal of spring . The nearness of Frances beside him on the cushioned seat of the buggy , the tantalizing whiffs of her perfume , the bloom of her young beauty , her full and comely figure , her elegance of mannerp210had been incalculably more enticing , alluring and captivating than all of the rich glory and subtle appeal of the spring evening . He hoped , of course , that the full moon and the moonlight , the stars , the trees , and Blue River  --  well , he had planned the night 's date with Frances and set out with the hope that all of this would stimulate her girlish heart to beat faster and weave a spell of romance and love inside her beautiful blond head . It was the gals , rather than the men , who went upsy-daisy , and looked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associations . But then women were the more refined sex , except for those who were no good , of course , whores , and , then , the ones who liked a good time and a good screwing . Most of the latter were more fun on a Saturday night than the decent ones like Mary Belle and Frances , but not for marrying , or for taking to parties in the Roverton section or on Drummond Place . However , Jack Pearson was n't like some fellows and men who thought any and all gals and women who screwed without a ring on their left hand were tramps and bums , harlots and just no good . Lots of them were good scouts . It was the respectable ones , in the main , who were the most likely to get gushy in the moonlight , and to bewitch themselves enough with moonshine so that they 'd lower the drawbridge enough for some real honest-to-goodness spooning . And sometimes when a respectable one had let down the drawbridgeand began to spoon and spark , Mother Nature got the upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrought up and roused that she let down her drawers . You never could tell and it could happen in the case of a girl from one of the most respectable and churchgoing of families . You never could tell for sure about the gals . When Jack Pearson had climbed up into the carriage , sat down , picked up the reins , gave a flip of the whip and started off to pick up Frances , he reminded himself of just that  --  you never could tell anything or know anything for sure about a gal . The most surprising things happened and sometimes when you least suspected or imaginedthat a gal would give it to you all the way , that could be just what she happened to do . However , Jack actually did n't have any expectation or hopes of getting it from Frances . Even though you could n't tell for sure , you could sometimes make pretty good guesses . Frances was a pretty good guess . He 'd never so much as heard a hint that she let any fel/low take any liberties with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In taking out Frances , Jack 's intentions were serious ; he was even ready to propose to her . He was twenty-four , and working for his father , or " the Gov. " as Jack dubbed him , but behind the back of Pearson , senior . Jack 's Governor was starting to put money into various enterprises , and in ten years the Pearson fortune was going to be damned sizable . By the time he , himself , should become an old fellow in his forties or fifties , Jack thought that the Pearson fortune might well be the biggest in Valley City . It would be one of the biggest , that much was certain . Jack had gone to the State University for two years , which had been more than enough , in fact , too much education for him . He liked going about , drinking and playing cards , hunting and fishing , and it had been a long time since he 'd been bashful when it came to the gals and the ladies . He had sown plenty of wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and marry but , in point of fact , he had made the decision to do so before he 'd become fascinated by Frances , curiously infatuated with her . He 'd been interested in Mary Belle Evans with the aim in mind of deciding whether or not she would make a satisfactory wife for him . He assumed that Mary Belle or any other young woman who became the object of his choice would accept his proposal with joy , gratitude , and love . Not only was he the son , the scion of a rising family , but he was also handsome and a hit with women and he knew it . He was overstocked in conceit , not only about his power to charm and win the hearts of the fair ones , but also over anything he was interested in and wanted to do . He did n't believe in the possibility of his own failure or defeat and he never failed or was defeated , except sometimes in poker or in a game of pool . In a sense , he could n't be defeatedbecause if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had quit college . Jack might very well have decided that Mary Belle was the lucky beauty but for Frances . Jack did n't believe in romantic love , which he regarded as gush for virgins who were being fed , clothed , sheltered , and kept pure and innocent for the slaughter of their innocence on their wedding night . Kids of sixteen or thereabouts with their faces full of pimples and blackheads , song writers who could cash in by writing of love and roses and the silver moon , and a writer who could also rake in the kale by writing gush and hot air about love in the days when knighthood was in flower , the likes of all such could believep212in romantic love or pretend that they did . This bosh helped to keep virgins giddy with dreams and hopes of love , something which was right and proper . A young fellow had every right to expect that the fair Juliet he took to his bed as wife would be pure and fresh goods , as innocent as any lamb slaughtered in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have brand-new ones , and this was most certainly true when the kind of goods a man was gettinghappened to be the wife of his bosom . A man of experience , such as Jack Pearson considered himself to be , knew that he was n't taking a fair one in to bed her and board her with dizzy hopes that they would love one another in the clouds , or even with the expectations that a man would have a hell of a lot of fun with his wife . The first night should be one of conquest and mastery , the night when beauty and the beast meet face-to-face , as naked as Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden or as naked as the days on which both beauty and the beast were born . And it would be the duty of beauty to succumb and surrender to the beast , with pain and shock . For the beast was her lord and master , conquering her as she could never again be conquered . This was a night of victory and mastery for a man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might get out of the wedding night of defloration should only be secondary to the thrill of power and mastery , and to the pleasure , too , of inflicting pain on beauty in the very act of making himself supreme over the conquered body of beauty . And then there would be the first period when they were both new to each other , and the fair one could give her body and enjoy her own flesh deliriously and without shame and disgrace . That would be fun . But once the beginning was over and they were settling down for life , the time of fun was over . And this kind of fun , even when it was new , brand-new and at its wildest , was special and it had to end . Once it did end , fun for a man would be found elsewhere . It would be good and dirty low-down fun with a low-down babe . A man could n't be low-down with his wife and still respect her , especially after she became the mother of his children . And that first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild because it was all so new , and it was the time when a decent woman could find a substitute for sowing her wild oats without losing her good name or sacrificing her respectability . But after a wife had her fling in the first days of marriage , and after she was no longer new to her husband , marriage really began . Whenever her husband wantedp213her , it would be her duty to comply and give herself , but for the most part , the edge would be rubbed down flat and smooth , and the husband would go to bed with his wife in order that she could bear him sons and daughters and , for the rest , he would do it often enough to keep her from having headaches and pains and aches and little ailmentsand attacks of nerves . Once she started , a woman could n't stop it completely , and keep her body and her nerves in balance . She needed it sometimes purely as a measure of health and so that her mind remained calm and she could keep some evenness of temper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and craving it and being wild in bed the way she would in the first period of her marriage ; if she did , then , she would n't and could n't be a good wife . Because a man of experience did n't pick a wife who wanted the honeymoon to last forever , and he would n't respect his wife if she did n't settle down according to what a wife should be , which was not at all to be a lowdown . Among girls of his own social status , Jack had the reputation of being a devil-of-a-fellow , a heart-breaker , a Don Juan , and the girls regarded him as being very romantic , handsome , and attractive , almostirresistibly attractive . Most important of all , he was one of the best catches or even the best catch in Valley City . For almost a year prior to his meeting Frances , Jack had already been casting his eyes about , observing and casually looking for a wife . He was in no hurry , but he was ready . He 'd gone about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , but he had not settled on any one , although he had almost settled on Mary Belle Evans . He spooned with girls of his own set , kissed them and whenever he sensed that they would go the whole way , he would try to make them . He had been successful with three or four , two of whom he got to surrender on spring nights and in a buggy in which he had driven them to the same spot along the Blue River to which he had taken Frances . Jack did not make special efforts to seduce respectablegirls . He knew that if he had tried extensively , he 'd have failed quite frequently . Also , success with some of these girls could result in unpleasant complications . It was easier and more fun to go out of his class and have his fun with girls whom he usually called lowdown . If he wanted more fun on a particular night and no girl was available , he would go to a prostitute and he went occasionally to one or another of the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p214Jack  Pearson had gradually become more interested in Mary Belle Evans . She was one of the prettiest and most popular girls in the Roverton section of Valley City . She was a round and plump , wellformed , pretty girl with a dimple in her chin , a gay flirt who charmed and drew the young men around her , despite the fact that most of them could n't even get a kiss from her . Mary Belle 's father was a lawyer , a Republican who placed PresidentMcKinley on a par with George Washington and Abraham Lincoln , and who would have worked himself through apoplexy into the grave because of ' William Jennings Bryan but for the fact that his arteries were very healthy and his anger did not affect his blood pressure . He was active in church affairs . Mary Belle 's grandfather had been an early settler , a member of the State Legislature , a man of political prominence and piety , and her father 's practice was very lucrative . Mary Belle was just about as good a catch as Jack Pearson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone said that the match of the year  --  nay , the match of the decade  --  was in the making . But then Jack Pearson saw and met Frances at a party . There was challengeat first sight between them . Frances was drawn to him , almost fearfully and with suppressed anger . He was attracted and intrigued because of an aloofness he sensed in her ; she was someone to subdue . Jack acted like a young man who had been smitten . She gave him one glance and he immediately crossed the room and openly gave his attention to Frances . He ignored Mary Belle for the remainder of the party . Such treatment could only be humiliating to Mary Belle . It was a shocking surprise . Frances did not live in Roverton ; she was almost a stranger , and had been brought to the party by a cousin , Bill Sugrue . Jack 's abandonmentof Mary Belle for the handsome blonde , who had virtually strayed into the party , was really mortifying . This had never happened to her before . She was placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to eat very humble pie . But she acted with proud courage . She cried alone , later.  |p215Jack  Pearson was usually indifferent to the feelings of others , especially when he was pursuing his own pleasure . He had made no commitment to Mary Belle , and he considered himself to be under no obligation to her . Were she to meet a man who intrigued or fascinated her , she would have acted very much as he did . Any woman would do the same . Of this , he was convinced . There was even a certain relish for him in defeating or rejecting a female . To do it was to win , he believed , the lasting respect of the woman . He had no hesitancy about switching his attention from Mary Belle to Frances . His instantaneous attraction to Frances gave Jack Pearson a certain relief , a sense of escape , because Mary Belle had already begun to penetrate his feelings . He had actually been in danger of succumbing to her far more fully than his " philosophy " allowed . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowded room , he crossed over to speak with her as though he were accepting a dare . In his acceptance , there were excited antagonistic impulses . He humiliatedMary Belle by dropping her for Frances , but in going after Frances , he was also bent on humiliating her . Only Jack Pearson did n't think of it as " humiliation " ; his terms were victory and conquest . After he had seen Frances a couple of times , Jack Pearson took her driving to the cove by the Blue River on that spring night . They were both infatuated with each other , and on the short drive to the cove by the Blue River , this infatuation , which involved a mutual attraction and antagonism , had stimulated intense sexual craving and hunger . After Jack had dropped the weight , he kissed Frances more sensually than she had ever been kissed before . But when Jack had dropped the weight to the ground , he hesitated for an infinitesimal fraction of a second before awkwardly embracing her . In this fraction of a second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The resistance did not immediately register in herp216sexually tormented consciousness , but as she responded to his kisses with the frankness of a woman whose passion is awakened , her impulse to withdraw worked until it began to kill her passion . While Jack , with the confidence and blind concentration of a man about to begin the act of sex with a woman for the first time , fumbled and strove to press her into a position to receive him , Frances ' resistance expressed itself in a hysterical panic . She cried out " No , " and " Do n't , " struggling until her passion and desire quickly died . Jack became insistent , believing that her sudden resistance merely represented her feminine contrariness and desire to be conquered . But Frances stiffened up , became rigidly resistant in his arms , shook and turned her head , and even bared her teeth . " No  --  I mean it , " she told him in a determined but agonized voice . IIe grasped the fact that she meant what she said . He ceased trying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him angry and undermined with fear that he had been defeated and treated like a fool . She rearranged herself , and his silence was mean as he drove her home . Alone in her bedroom and undressing , Frances trembled . She was torn and divided , because she was relieved not to have succumbed and yet wished that he had overpowered her , ravished her . Shortly after this evening , she began seriously to allow Tom to pay her court . Torn was comfortable because he was safe and did not rouse in her desires that threatened a loss of control or any kind of slavish submission . Later Jack Pearson married a girl from Chicago . And Mary Belle found another suitor whom she married . But for a long time , Frances was as unpopular as she was admired for being the girl who had bested Jack Pearson.  |p217The  birth of a Mongoloid baby was a greater blow to Tom 's pride than Frances realized . Tom could not completely stifle his fear that the Mongoloid infant was the doing and the punishment of God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked of behind his back , pitied as one who had forebears from whom he had inherited the strain , the seeds , which could produce more idiots . Tom was gnawed by uncertainty . Separate from what anyone else might think or believe , he lived with the dread that there was a defective strain in him and that , later on , this could even show in himself . The same dread about Frances would come to mind in a burst of almost crippling anxiety . In the months following the birth of the Mongoloid , he would sit and morosely gaze at the burning logs in the fireplace , overwhelmed by his dejection . He was afraid to talk to Frances about it . As time passed , Tom got to believing that his suffering exceeded Frances 's , that he , more intensely than she , had felt the blows , the sorrows , the shame of having a Mongoloid baby . At times , in the evening after dinner , with the kids in bed , he 'd feel lonely . There was no one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was really preying on his mind . His problem was to go on living , to let the memory of what had happened sink away in time . This was what Tom frequently told himself . And the days passed . Frances looked the same as she had before this last and tragic pregnancy . Life should be going on just as it had before . He wanted it to . But things did n't seem to him to be quite the same as they had been . Hep218did n't know what was on her mind , what she was thinking , and he could n't bring himself to tell her what he was thinking . Things were n't the same , and Frances seemed like a stranger to him , and he like one to her . But he wanted things to be the same , to be as they were . He lived from day to day hoping that the spirit , the atmosphere in their home would change , and that there would be a return to what they had had between them before he 'd made Frances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had been kind of awful for her , too , an awful time for both of them . And they had both had such hopes and great expectations for the new baby . Both of them , they would have been made so happy and so proud if , if only , if only Frances had given him the kind of a son he had expected and wanted , the kind they both had expected and wanted . Tom vividly remembered the night the Mongoloid was born . He 'd waited in the parlor , trying not to be nervous , pacing the rug and wishing that he could stop himself from pacing , acting just like any father-to-be . He did n't know what to do with himself , and when he heard Frances moaning it was like being hit in the pit of the stomach from the inside , and it stopped him dead in his tracks in the center of the room . He was tense with dread . Her moan rose into a wail . He clenched his right fist and shook his arm jerkily in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When would it end ? When would it come ? Tom was standing directly under the glass chandelier . Gazing up at the electric bulbs , he squinted and blinked his eyes . He remembered the night they had first turned those electric lights on . Must have been about eight years ago , maybe six or seven or five . He was n't very good at remembering when it came to the number of years ago that something happened and something that he had done . The sockets for the gas were still in the chandelier . Changing from gas to electricity meant progress and he 'd felt mighty good and proud . That had been a happy night in happy times when he had kissedFrances under the electric lights of the sparkling glass chandelier . Tom almost jumped as Frances screamed upstairs . But if she wasp219screaming , the baby must be coming . Her pain and labor would be over , and she would look beautiful . She 'd have that wearied but satisfied expression on her face , the most satisfied look a woman can have . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And yes , he 'd be a proud father . Why not ? Why should n't he be ? Tom was pacing again . Frances had n't screamed again . He was waiting for the next scream , wanting it to come soon , wanting it to come very soon . He wanted her travail over with . Was she all right ? Suppose something went wrong , and she died ? What would he do ? But it was impossible . It could n't happen , not with Doc Jones and the midwife there in the room . Nothing could happen to her . This was n't her first baby . She was healthy , one of the healthiest women in Valley City . But suppose she did die ? As this question flashed through his mind , Frances screamed again behind the closed door of the bedroom upstairs . It sounded eerie to Tom . Frances could have been screaming in Hell , in some Hell , a room like a dungeon which was far away and in some other world . It was as if he were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , he was wide awake . And that was what was giving him the creeps , not Frances . She 'd be all right , and soon , too . God , he hoped so . What she was going through was natural and she had gone through it all before . Tom sat down in the rocker , determined to calm himself by the force of his will power . He could n't sit still or rock gently and easily . The rocking chair squeaked as he almost rode the chair like a hobby horse . He thought of his wife dead . But if she died in childbirth , he could n't be blamed ; he was n't to blame . No , he could n't be blamed because it was the Will of God that women suffer in childbirth . It was God who had told Eve that her punishment for eating the apple from the Tree of Knowledge would be to bear Adam 's children in pain . Tom rocked nervously . The chair squeaked . Tom saw Frances lying cold and dead in a dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she should die . But this question caused him no sorrow or grief . He only asked himself what would happen and what it would be like for himself and the kids . Frances screamed again , a little louder and longer than before . This time , there was nothing eerie for Tom in his wife 's scream . It was real and human , a cry of pain . Tom stopped rocking abruptly . He winced . He felt mean and sinful . Why God , what was he comingp220to when he could even let himself think this way that Frances might die by giving birth to his child ? He tightened up inside after hearing another of Frances ' screams . This one sounded as though it had been torn out of Frances as her new baby might be . What could he do but wait ? He felt as though he were collapsing inside himself with helplessness.  --  God , oh God ! he told himself silently but intensely . ' When Torn heard the door of the upstairs bedroom opening , he was swept with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downstairs . Tom was beginning to feel foolish , and giddily happy , and to grin with relief and joy . For Doc Jones was coming downstairs to tell him the good news . He saw the solemn face of the middle-aged doctor . He was a stocky man with a big head , and a thick , dark brown mustache , slowly , heavily planting his brown lace shoes on each successively lower step . As Dr. Jones came on down the stairs , his solemn face gave Torn a flicker of doubt , but he did n't really believe that Doc had bad news . Dr. Jones acted this way and was solemn on the occasion because he was maintaining his dignity as a doctor . Tom was kind of shaking to ask Doc was it a boy or a girl , but he knew Doc Jones . The doctor came all of the way downstairs , took a few steps toward Tom , put his hands on Tom 's shoulders , looked down at him , grim more than solemn , sympathy and understanding in his brown eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Torn neither believed nor understood Dr. Jones . Then , a realization of what the doctor had told him , of what it meant , came as a kind of cold and creeping unhappiness . When Torn spoke to the doctor , his words were calm and subdued . He had to act like a man . A man did n't cry or break down . But when he spoke , his feelings were not behind his words ; they were lost , drowned somewhere insideof himself . Then there was the moment when he walked into the room . Frances looked beautiful and somehow relaxed and peaceful even though tears were streaming down her face . In the bedroom , even more than downstairs , he had to act like a man . And there was his first sight of the baby in the arms of Elly Benson , the gray-haired midwife . He was n't sure that he could look at the baby without giving way . At first , he did n't see anything wrong about the baby . But the wish that Doc Jones was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloom hit the centerp221of his mind like buckshot . The little baby was n't a baby . It was like some kind of animal . It was repugnant to him . He turned his head away . He would n't look any more . It seemed that everything good and all joy in his life were dead and could never be resurrected . The Mongoloid baby had lived and died . There were the other children , Richard and Myrtle . And he and Frances had each other . Time would heal their wounds . But they did n't forget . Neither of them could forget . They could n't go on living as though nothing tragic had happened . They sometimes felt far apart from each other . They guiltily believed that the tragedy of the Mongoloid infant had been the cause of their feelings . They obscured memories of their life together before their tragedy . Actually , Tom and Frances had already felt quite far apart from each other but they had thought this always happened after a married couple had settled down to the business of living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom awoke hoping that he would begin to feel what he believed he had used to feel for Frances . And also , he hoped that he would see signs of a change in Frances . He thought that she was the one to blame more than himself , and it was Frances who had changed . She was holding out on him and it was not right for a wife to do that . No wonder there was n't the right feeling between them . Tom had waited a long time , all through the last months of Frances 's pregnancy . He waited for a decent period after the terrible birth . It had been rough on him , waiting , God yes , rough . But Frances made him wait . She kept putting him off , and postponing the first time with vague promises about another night . But then , she told him that he must wait , that he must understand how she felt as a woman , and that after the terrible tragedy that had happened , she could n't , not yet , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while longer until she was ready and then , she would . She had put him off again . He was a man and no man could understand a woman , but he must try to be a little understanding , at least that much . Tom tried . He felt guilty , he felt noble , and he felt protective . But he had gone a long time without it , and regardless of how hep222felt , the Old Adam in himself would n't remain quiet and asleep . He hoped , he brooded . Silently to himself , he complained of her . He woke up on many mornings hoping that the day had come when she would be ready . At the end of the day he would come home for dinner hoping . And all during this time , Tom was also brooding about their dead Mongoloid baby . One night when they had entertained and there had been singing , the lust and the Old Adam in Tom rose to an irresistible pitch , and finally Frances acquiesced . Tom believed that it was on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new strain and waiting . Then , Zeke was born.  |p223Tom  was happy for himself and for Frances . He was chipper and he was all smiles and beaming , and he passed out twenty-five-cent cigars to his friends . And Frances seemed very happy . To Tom , she did . Tom thought that the new baby would make up for the other one . Frances would forget . He , too , would forget . But neither of them forgot . They remembered with fear . Each of them watched the new baby , day by day , looking for signs , hoping not to find them . Each night they went to bed in thankful relief because the new baby boy seemed to be all right , just like any other baby . Frances tried to feel for Zeke and to see in him all that she had hoped for and anticipated while she had been carrying the Mongoloid baby . She tried to love Zeke , but somehow he kept serving as a reminderof his defective and dead brother . During the first days of Zeke 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy 's being another monster , she even had horrifyingnightmares . Then , she began telling Tom and herself that the baby looked so distinguished and smart . She tried to believe that this was really true , but she could n't feel quite certain that it was . Tom gradually became less worried about the baby . The days passed into months , and the baby looked all right to him , just the way that a baby ought to look . The baby was n't as handsome as Frances kept making out , but then , she was the little guy 's mother , and of course , there was a mother 's pride and a mother 's love . Tom guessed that after her experience with the monster baby , Francesp224led herself to see a lot more in her new son , Little Zeke , than anyone else would . Little Zeke made her forget . The baby made her happy . Tom thanked the Lord for that . It just made him mighty glad . He was proud , too , because Little Zeke sure was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this , even though sometimes to hear Frances talk , he , the father , had n't had anything at all to do with the making of the latest of the heirs of Thomas Daniels . However , Tom thought that Little Zeke was good for his mother , and that was mighty important . She kept talking and talking about the baby , and she talked more about him than she had about the other two of their kids , Richard and Myrtle . Night after night , she would say the same things over again , just like she was saying something for the first time . Tom got so that he only half-listened , and on many nights , he scarcely even heard Frances when she talked about Little Zeke . As Little Zeke kept growing , Frances found more reasons for describinghim as an exceptional baby , more cause for telling Tom that Zeke would grow up to be something very important and distinguished , and perhaps , he would even one day become a great man . She had n't talked like this of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was certain that he knew why Frances talked this way , like she did , about Zeke . She was a proud and loving mother because of the tragedy . So it seemed . Sometimes Tom thought that if Frances kept on in this same fashion , she would spoil Little Zeke . But Tom always hoped for the best . That was what everybody ought to do , hope for the best . Tom did n't notice that while Frances talked so much about Zeke , she did not kiss him or fondle him very much . Her laughing , too , was of pride , not affection . It was rare that she sang to him , or played with him . It was rare that she laughed with him . She was different with Zeke as a baby than she had been with her other two children . And even Frances ' tone of voice was sometimes flat , and often when she spoke of Zeke , it sounded a bit artificial . Tom perceived all this only vaguely , and he never tried to think what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frances talked as though she were convinced beyond any doubt that Zeke would actually grow up to become a great man . But she had doubts and fears which she neverp225expressed . She tried to smother them , make them die , but what did die in her was whatever love she might have had for Zeke . Thus it had been from the beginning with Frances Daniels and Zeke . Again and again she had tried to believe that Zeke was as superior as she claimed . The ambition she had generated while carrying the Mongoloid had transferred to Zeke , and now it was trapping her  --  and trapping Zeke too . During Zeke 's boyhood and adolescence , Mrs. Daniels would reason that his character had n't as yet been formed . Only in the years to come would he start showing the results of her inspiration . With this reasoning , she was able to ignore all of the evidence revealed by Zeke in his conduct , evidence that he could never fulfillher ambitions for him . After he had begun his short and unsuccessful college career , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practically without ambition and that she should n't expect him to want to make anything of himself . With all of her efforts , she had not inspired him . I-Iow could she expect to in the future ? But Mrs. Daniels was able to admit failure without becoming disappointed . She was not distressed . Zeke had just about become a man and there was n't anything wrong with his brain . Nothing , other than it was n't too good . Zeke was n't like that poor , dead , sick-in-the-head baby who had come just before Zeke . No one who knew about her terrible , great tragedy , and that poor , dear , oh , God , that Mongoloid , she could n't say the word , but it was in her head , " that idiot , " none who knew had ever seen anything of that kind wrong with Zeke . And they could n't . For no , there was nothing wrong with her son , Ezekiel , Zeke , in such a sense . This assurance gave Frances Daniels all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fears pressed into hidden corners of her being could die with the past , vanish as her Mongoloid had into the earth . The form of her interest in Zeke remained . Mrs. Daniels did not lose the habits of years . She catered to him , waited on him , babied him . She tried to influence him to the degree that she might maintain control over him . She praised Zeke to his face and otherwise spoke of him as though she were the proudest of mothers . Tom Daniels and Zeke had little to say to each other . Frances knew Tom believed that whatever Zeke became would be her doing . She could n't acknowledge and admit failure before Tom , and she de/fended Zeke whenever Tom grumbled or even expressed a hint of dissatisfaction . Frances Daniels knew that Zeke constantly chased girls just as she knew that Tom drank . Zeke was young , he was a man , and he had to sow his wild oats . Then , after he had sown them , he would settle down in marriage , perhaps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw safety from marriage in numbers . She did n't want Zeke to marry badly , picking out some fool of a girl , or a girl socially beneath himself and the Daniels family . His future was safe , because Tom and Zeke 's older brother had pretty good heads for business . Zeke could n't spoil the business that had been built up by Tom , and Tom Daniels ' dead father . Frances wanted to be certain that Zeke did n't marry any girl who might interfere in the business and money affairs of her family . Her expectation that Zeke would become a distinguished man or a great man had been dropped along the wayside of her life . She had ceased speaking of Zeke 's future grandeur . She still saw much of herself in him . She wanted to believe that Zeke had both inherited and acquired some of her smartness and cleverness . She wanted him to have the upper hand when he dealt with other people , especially with those girls he chased . She did n't ever want him to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had become a grown man and that she did not worry about him . This was true to a great extent , but she did try to keep some tabs on him , more than he realized . She was a very busy woman , what with social and church affairs , and clubs , and quite a number of other things to do , including her family , of course , yes , of course . However , Frances Daniels saw to it that she knew at least something about what her children and her husband were up to . She carefully tended her reputation as a wife and mother . She wanted to retain the conviction that hers had been a happy life , as happy lives could be lived by women such as she.
