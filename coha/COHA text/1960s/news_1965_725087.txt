txt Stockholders will get the fattest dividend checks ever this Christmas season . Last December 's dividend package was a record-breaker ; ' on a seasonally adjusted annual basis , it pushed corporate payments above $18 billion for the first time . But the payment rate this December , by all indications , seems a cinch to demolish last year 's mark and probably will reach a $19 billion annual pace . Henry Kaufman , economist for Salomon Brothers &; Hutzler , a New York securities firm , expresses the view of many financial analysts : " It 's a safe bet that shareholders can look forward in the weeks ahead to a spate of very good dividend increases . " Last Month 's Increases Indeed , evidence that dividends are sharply on the rise already is beginning to pile up . Last month 152 publicly owned corporations announced plans to increase their dividend payments , according to Standard &; Poor 's Corp .. a statistical and investment advisory concern . This was a record for the month , up from 131 such announcements in September 1964 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Electric Co. and Federated Department Stores , Inc . The rash of increases is continuing in October . The most notable boost so far has been by Ford Motor Co. , which early this month raised its quarterly rate to 60 cents a share from 50 cents , a 20% increase . The Ford action , in the view of many financial analysts , greatly increases the chances that General Motors Corp. , Ford 's giant competitor , will decide to boost its dividend rate substantially when GM 's directors meet in New York a week from today . On Friday morning , in fact , trading of GM shares on the New York Stock Exchange was delayed for nearly an hour because of an accumulation of buy orders ; when trading in GM finally did get under way , the shares opened at $111 , a new high and up ** from the closing Thursday price . Brokers attributed the unusual demand to rumors of a large dividend increase . Besides Ford , other major companies that announced dividend increases early this month include R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents previously ) and Phillips Petroleum Co. ( to 55 cents quarterly from 50 Cents ) . A Phillips spokesman explained the higher rate was set because of anticipated higher earnings this year and in 1966 . Gillette . Sinclair Act On the heels of these increases , just last week higher dividend payments were announced by such other major concerns as Standard Oil Co . ( Indiana ) , Aluminium , Ltd. , Diamond Alkali Co .. Gillette Co. , Reynolds Metals Co .. Sinclair Oil Corp. , Scott Paper Co. , R. R. Donnelley &; Sons Co. and Atlantic Coast Line Railroad . In some cases the increases were unusually large . The Atlantic Coast Line boost , for instance , puts the railroad 's quarterly rate at 75 cents a common share , a full 25 cents above the previous rate . In addition , the line announced an extra dividend payment of $1.25 a common share , 25 cents above the extra paid near the end of last year . The Louisville &; Nashville Railroad also announced a larger extra , plus an increased quarterly dividend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared an extra dividend of 25 cents , in addition to its regular quarterly dividend . At the end of last year , the big oil concern paid an extra dividend of only 20 cents . Not only are extra dividend payments getting bigger , but also more companies are paying extras . In September , 67 publicly owned corporations announced extras , according to Standard &; Poor 's , up from 61 in the comparable 1964 month . New Dividend Payers a Some firms , moreover , are beginning to pay dividends for the first time . Example : Last Wednesday Texas Oil &; Gas Corp . declared an initial annual dividend of 10 cents a common share . With its earnings " up to expectations . " an official of the company explained , " the board decided it was time to give some thought to paying a dividend . " At the same time , there are fewer instances of corporations omitting dividend payments . In September , according to Standard &; Poor 's , only six firms skipped their scheduled payments , down from eight in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moaned yield of stocks that make up the Dow-Jones industrial stock average . Dividend yield , of course , is related to the price of stock . If a share of stock costs $100 and pays $5 of dividends in a year . the yield is 5% . Dividend yields of stocks measured in the Dow-Jones industrial average amounted to 3.28% last week . That 's low historically but still up from 3.24% a. year before  --  despite the fact the Dow-Jones average cf industrial share prices was some 75 points higher at the end of last week than 12 months earlier . Underlying the rise in dividends are many months of briskly rising corporate profits . Benefiting from an economic expansion that began all the way back in February 1961 , most corporations appear headed toward record earnings this year After-tax profits of corporations hit a. record annual rate of $44.4 billion in the year 's second quarter . a. full 20% above the yearearlier figure . Recent reports suggest the profit climb is continuing . though at perhaps a. somewhat less spectacular pace . So dramatic has the rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dividend climb companies actually have been paying out to shareholders a smaller portion of their aftertax petals than in 1964 . In the second quarter of this year , the last period for which a detailed breakdown is available , corporation , paid out 41,1 of their aftertax profits in dividends This is far below the comparable 1964 paj.out rate of 46 ' , . As recently as 1961 , corporations paid out slightly more than half their after-tax earnings in dividends to shareholders . Looking beyond the end of the year , some analysts caution that the rise in dividend payments could slow They cite not only the possibility of a slowdown in the increase in profits but also the likelihood that money may continue to grow tighter , a development that could prompt firms to use more of their earnings for expansion projects instead of borrowing funds . Tighter money , of cour , e , could also slow economic activity generally : were that to happen , earning ? and ultimately dividends ? would be bound to suffer .

According to the report . which covers all companies 11-ted on the Big Board . common cash dividends paid by textile companies , for instance , were a whopping 48 3 higher in the first six months of 1965 than in the first half of 1964 .
