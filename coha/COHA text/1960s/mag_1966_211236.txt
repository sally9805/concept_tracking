By all the laws of political parity , the historically conservative farm states should return in resounding numbers to the Republican ranks in this year 's mid term elections . Indeed , there can be little hope of a nationwide Republican resurgence in 1968 unless the party can recapture its traditional power base in the heartland . Anticipating an almost reflex " crossback " of G.O.P. voters who helped elect Democrats in 1964 , Iowa G.O.P. Chairman Robert Ray contends : " This extreme change from one party to another in our state was as though the voters had suddenly stepped into 20 weather . The shock 's been too great . They have to come back this year to where it 's a little warmer . " <P> Nonetheless , the farm vote , while seldom predictable , remains one of the most enigmatic elements of all in the November balloting . Perhaps more than any other sector of the economy , agriculture has been hurt by rising prices , high taxes and tight money . A tractor that sold for $6,000 in 1961 costs $9,000 today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risen in recent times from around 4% to as high as 10% a year ; in some areas the cost of farm-machinery loans has gone up 4% in the past six months . " A half percent increase in interest does n't seem like much , " says Raymond Robinson , who raises livestock on a 115-acre spread near Marion , Iowa . " But on a big farm operation it can make the difference between profit and loss . " <P> " Slip , Slide and Duck . " Disaffection in the farm belt reached a peak last spring , when the Administration pictured the growers as the chief culprits and beneficiaries of soaring supermarket prices . On nationwide TV , President Johnson even suggested to housewives that they buy cheaper cuts of meat . The biggest shock to farmers was Freeman 's gaffe in March expressing pleasure at a slight-if short-lived-drop in food prices . Never before had a U.S. Secretary of Agriculture publicly applauded a decrease in farm income , and the incident earned Orville the unofficial title , over much of the prairies , of " Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressed by Freeman 's characteristically uninhibited reply when he was asked by Democratic congressional candidates in Washington how they should answer consumer complaints about the cost of living . Advised Orville : " Slip , slide and duck . If you have to choose a side , take the farmer 's side . Housewives are n't nearly as well organized . " To suspicious rural minds , the comment was hardly reassuring . <P> Bounteous Breadbasket . Farmers , who have endless faith in the land and endemic hope for the future , still practice grumbling as a full-time avocation . And in fact , farm parity-the New Deal equation for measuring their purchasing power-has itself done some slipping and sliding . Under Truman , parity averaged 107.5% ; it dropped to 84.5% during the Eisenhower years ; since 1961 it has fallen to 78% . For all the advances in agricultural technology , farmers still earn only two-thirds the average income of nonfarmers . Their discontent was reflected in a poll published this month by the influential Farm Journal . Of 5,000 ballots returned by farmer subscribers , 87% urged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor of getting the Government completely out of the farm-price-support business .
