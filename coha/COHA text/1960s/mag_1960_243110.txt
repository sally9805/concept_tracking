An agent for a major U.S. publisher checked into book sales at Iowa State University recently and got a terrible shock . Pirated editions of U.S. books , mailed from Formosa , were arriving in such numbers that the campus post office had to use a hand cart to make deliveries . For the past two months , Iowa State students had been ordering . books at the rate of $500 a week .

Previous protests against the export of Formosan copies to Asian countries hai little effect . This time the State Department hinted that mutual-security funds earmarked for Nationalist China might be pared by irate Congressmen if the pirating did not cease . The hint did not go unheeded .
