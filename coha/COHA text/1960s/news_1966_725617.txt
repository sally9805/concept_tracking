txt All signs point to a resounding success on the world economic front . India has created a new and much more favorable climate for private investment in a key industry ? the production of fertilizer . The United States has given its blessing . The World Bank has done likewise . Nearly a billion dollars in loans will begin to flow into India shortly , from a consortium formed by the World Bank . Foreign aid from the United States has been resumed , in particular a system by which private capital from the West can be insured against major risks from overseas investment . A high-level Indian mission will arrive in the United States on June 21 to negotiate with a number of big American oil corn-panics . They are the ones capable of building huge , modern fertilizer plants of the sort that India ? and much of the underdeveloped world ? urgently needs .

India now has done this . The Prime Minister , Mrs. Indira Gandhi , has stoutly defended her new and favorable approach to Western private investment , against a group in the Indian Parliament which has traditionally been hostile to it . She seems , from the perspective of the White House , to have the situation in hand . So ends the first chapter in President Johnson 's tough  --  minded but earnest effort to open a new era for private capital in the moderate socialist countries of the developing world . It began with the President 's message on for . eign aid , earlier this year , which was based on a new philosophy . The President was not going to give Amer* // *India grasps U. S. aid terms Contimied from Page 1 ican aid to countries which did not really make their private sectors work . The long years of technically opening the doors to private capital , but actually harrassing it and forcing rules on It which were dictated ideological hostility , were to end , Mr. , ' ohnson indicated . From now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sternly disciplined and fully enforced program for giving private enterprise its head , in all matters except abuses which would be damaging to India and its people . Otherwise there would be no aid . There were many skeptics here who said that countries like India would never really accept the new dispensation . But Prime Minister Gandhi and her economic advisers have not only done so , they have showed great political courage in facing their parliamentary critics , as Washington sees it . Terms favorable So the dam broke this past week . The big United States oil corporations still have to give their formal approval , by signing contracts with the Indian Government . But the terms are so favorable now , and the White House vigor on their behalf so impressive , that no great difficulty is expected . Investing companies will have their prices and markets free from government restriction in India for a guaranteed period of seven years . That is time enough to recover their entire investment capital , and there will be nothing but profit without important risk from there on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renews the guarantee . If it should not work , and India decides not to renew , no capital should have been lost , between the investment guarantee of the Agency for International Development and the presumed ability to repay the capital out of profits in seven years . About 90 percent of India 's fertilizer now is being produced by plants largely owned and operated by the government . When the new program is completed , 50 percent will be in the newly reorganized private sector . Construction under way Existing plant can produce about half a billion tons of basic nitrogen fertilizer . Almost as much more is under construction and will bring the total to not far under one billion tons by the end of next year . Another three quarters of a billion tons of capacity is provided by contracts now actively under negotiation . But much of this is high-cost fertilizer . And 11/2 billion more tons of capacity is still needed . The Western oil companies , which could bring in huge , ultramodern , low-cost plants , are the ones who were holding back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House is elated at this first victory under its bold new program , and considers that a high order of statesmanship has been shown by all concerned . It remains now to see if the oil companies agree and put the last building blocks of the new program into place .
