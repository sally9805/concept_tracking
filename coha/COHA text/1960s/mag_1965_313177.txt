When the unhappy clerical worker consulted Dr. Manrico Troncelliti of Pennsylvania 's Sacred Heart Hospital in Norristown , he seemed a veritable caricature of obesity . He was 5 ft. 2 in. tall and weighed 376 lbs . He could hardly walk a city block and not tie his own shoelaces . He had a bleeding ulcer on his leg that refused to heal-a common problem of the grossly overweight . <P> Satisfied that both diet and drugs had already been tried , Dr. Troncelliti decided on heroic measures . He prescribed a jejuno-colostomy ( short-circuiting most of the small bowel ) , an operation devised in 1912 for patients suffering from incurable metabolic defects . Because the body absorbs most of its fats through the wall of the lower small bowel , by drastically shortening that absorbing wall the surgeon hoped to limit his patient 's assimilation of fat calories . <P> Blind Loop . Dr. Troncelliti opened the man 's abdomen and cut the small bowel about 42 inches below the point where it emerges from behind the large bowel ( see diagram ) . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into the side of the transverse colon , leaving the remaining 15 to 20 feet of the small bowel as a nonfunctioning blind loop . When the man recovered from the operation , he continued to overeat , but the food digested in his stomach and duodenum passed more directly into his colon . He absorbed enough protein and starch to keep him alive but not enough fat to maintain his weight . <P> The patient lost 96 lbs . in little more than a year , and his leg ulcer healed . Then he developed a hernia at the operation scar , so the surgeons went in again . Since his weight loss had been only moderate , they cut out a foot of jejunum . That did it . The clerical worker is now down to a merely rotund 165 lbs. ; he is back at his office desk , able to tie his shoelaces , and happy as never before . <P> No Panacea . After such surgery , now standardized with a 30-inch loop of jejunum , most patients suffer from some diarrhea , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily . This is not a high price to pay for the dramatic benefits , Dr. Troncelliti suggested in his report to the annual congress of the American College of Surgeons last week . At the same time , he emphasized that he is not recommending this " super-surgery as a panacea for the super-obese . " To qualify as a candidate for jejuno-colostomy , a patient must be at least 100 lbs . overweight , must have tried and failed with other reducing regimens , and must have some medical problem associated with excess weight-a high blood-cholesterol level , for example , or abnormally high blood pressure . <P> In most of the ten such cases Dr. Troncelliti has operated on at Norristown and at Bryn Mawr Hospital , the desired loss in weight has been accompanied by a lowering of cholesterol level or blood pressure , or both . A rare advantage of this operation is that it is reversible-if weight loss becomes too great , the jejunum and ileum can be hooked up again in the way that nature intended .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
