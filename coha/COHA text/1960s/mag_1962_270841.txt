STAND STILL LIKE THE HUMMINGBIRD ( 194 pp. ) - Henry Wilier-New Directions ( $4 ) . <P> <P> Henry Miller is still the world 's most smuggled author-no Sarah Lawrence girl would think of returning to the temperate zones from her junior year abroad without a copy of his still-banned Tropic of Capricorn or Rosy Crucifixion hidden in the soiled laundry . But he is also the author most often skipped . That is to say , the almost unvarying gait for getting through one of Miller 's books is : read four pages , skip four pages . Cynics will suggest that this is because the dirty passages in the Tropics or Sexus , Nexus and Plexus come at four-page intervals . This is shallow thinking . Actually the canny reader skips through Miller not so much to concentrate on naughtiness as to avoid what comes between . What does is ill-written blather on one of two subjects : 1 ) the downtrodden state of artists in the U.S. ( and their uptrodden bliss in Europe ) , and 2 ) how the world 's troubles would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Stand Still Like the Hummingbird is a collection of essays written over the last 30 years , dealing with topics 1 and 2 and designed to demonstrate that Miller is really a serious thinker . But it may well ruin Miller 's profitably bad reputation in the U.S. ( Tropic of Cancer , free from federal restraint since 1961 , is selling hugely , thanks in part to the police chiefs in some 60 communities , who hound it with a righteousness usually reserved for bookmakers who do not pay their protection money . ) A random sampling produces : " Fresh from Europe , the American scene held about as much charm for me as a dead rattlesnake lying in the deep freeze . What can possibly give us the idea that we are a vital , lusty , joyous , creative people ? ' ' " The American is an unsocial being who seems to find enjoyment only in the bottle or with his machines . " " It is particularly refreshing to observe the remarkable behavior and apparent contentment , often with little , of French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less joyous on that account . " For a writer , Europe is " undoubtedly more grim , more terrifying , more fecund , and ever so much more real . " <P> Yet this matter of reality is perplexing . The loathsome , reptilian U.S. seems real enough , but the suspicion arises that Miller is rhapsodizing a Europe that never was . Sense and consistency are not what one asks of a polemicist . If his rotten eggs hit their target often enough , it does not matter what else they hit . And some of Miller 's past eruptions have spattered the landscape marvelously , affronting puritans by proving the neglected Rabelaisian theorem that fornication can be funny . But more often , as in the present book , what Miller throws is not rotten eggs but gamy generalities ( art is good , materialism is bad ) . His words tumble along at the same daft speed whatever the subject , but Miller , however good a pillowsopher , does not stand up as a thinker.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
