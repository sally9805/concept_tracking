NEWSPAPERS Doing Without the Dailies <P> Boston 's month-old newspaper strike sputtered out last week . During a 14-hour negotiating session with the unions , the publishers offered a fresh proposal on the controversial pension plan and gave hints of a wage boost as well . <P> " We 've got enough unions to talk to from here to Chicago , " said Boston Globe President John Taylor , referring to the eleven unions , which disagree on the kind of contract they want . <P> While they waited for the unions and the papers to compromise , Bostonians were getting their news in spurts . Sales of out-of-town papers rose sharply . The Sunday New York Times brought as much as $1.50 a copy . TV Guide sold like sweepstakes tickets . Television stations stepped up their coverage , and staffers of the Record American and the Herald-Traveler appeared on camera daily to read the news . Decked out in button-down TV-blue shirts , they no longer looked like the old city-room gang . Boston Globe reporters also tried TV , but gave it up . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera , they were making such a bad impression that they feared people would not read them once they got back into print . <P> Their concern was understandable , but Bostonians were obviously hungering for print . When WNAC-TV plastered subways and buses with posters of a newspaper overlayed with big black letters , " Tonight go home and read your Channel 7 , " one subway rider was spotted with his nose against a poster as he tried to decipher the fine print in the background of the ad . <P> He may soon get something meatier to read . At week 's end , the publishers announced that they had reached a tentative settlement with the printers and mailers , leaders of the strike- who reportedly agreed to accept pay raises in lieu of increased fringe benefits . The agreement still must be ratified by the union membership . But with luck , Bostonians will be getting their fingers dirty again this week .
