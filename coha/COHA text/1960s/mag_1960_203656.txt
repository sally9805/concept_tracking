Nikita &; the RB-47 <P> Once the nations of the world were fortresses lying snugly behind their three-mile limits , a tradition established 250 years ago , when three miles was the span of a cannon 's shot . In the modern world of atoms , rockets , and planes swifter than sound , the wall of the fortress is invisible . The wall is electronic-an outthrust barrier of radars , direction-seeking radios and - aiming instruments . For both the U.S. and the Soviet Union , it has become vital to spot and plot the ever-shifting shadows and strengths of the adversary 's invisible frontier . <P> Amid deepest secrecy , U.S. and Allied planes and ships have long prowled the air and sea approaches to the Soviet fortress . Such so-called " ferret " fights probe the Russian radar fences in the Pacific , in the Middle East and in the Arctic north . The Russians , for their part , send a weekly fight of radar-snooping planes along Japan 's northeast coasts with such unfailing regularity that it is known as the " Tokyo Express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a much-photographed nuisance of herself oT the U.S. Atlantic Coast-taking bearings on U.S. coastal radars , barging boldly into the midst of fleet and Air Force maneuvers . On one occasion , in a practice session off Long Island , the U.S. nuclear sub George Washington fired a dummy Polaris , and a Navy tug churned over to recover the missile . Before it got there , the Vega steamed over the horizon , headed straight for the floating missile . <P> Last Call . But the ferret flight that left from the U.S. base in the English town of Brize Norton on July 1 was destined to become a brief but acrimonious international incident . The plane was an RB-47 , the reconnaissance version of the Air Force 's workhorse medium jet bomber . It was scheduled to fly the routine ferret run off the Soviet Arctic coast , a triangular course ( see map ) around the Barents Sea plotted to keep the ferret plane at least 75 miles away from Soviet territory . At 3:03 p.m. , upon reaching the appointed spot about 300 miles northeast of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its triangular patrol . It was the ferret 's last call . After waiting overnight , the U.S. Air Force announced that the plane was missing and organized a search . <P> The searchers were wasting their time . Somewhere along the run , a Soviet fighter had intercepted the plane and shot it down . For the Russians , the kill presented no problem . It was broad daylight . The weather was clear . The plane presumably was flying at its assigned altitude of 12,000 ft. , within easy reach of the most obsolete fighter , and on the course other U.S. ferret planes had regularly flown before . But the Russians must have planned carefully . U.S. monitors listening in on Soviet command channels heard no messages transmitted between Russian bases and the plane . <P> With Khrushchev away touring Austria , First Deputy Premier Anastas Mikoyan and his lieutenants in the Kremlin dithered for ten days over what to do about the downed RB-47-For reasons best known to themselves , they said nothing . In fact , they sent a cruiser out to play a grisly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the survivors .
