For months , Moscow had been hinting at new space spectaculars to help celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution . When a brand-new spacecraft called Soyuz 1 was launched into orbit last week carrying veteran Cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov , 40 , it seemed certain that the first manned Soviet flight since March 1965 was aimed at overtaking and even surpassing the faltering U.S. Apollo program . Barely 24 hours later , Komarov was dead , killed in a crash landing that may ground the Russian man-in-space program for months . <P> There was good reason to believe that Komarov 's ill-fated flight had been planned as Phase 1 of a highly ambitious mission . Unofficial reports from Moscow had indicated that Soyuz would be joined in orbit by another spacecraft carrying several men and that the two ships would attempt to rendezvous , dock , exchange crews and set up an orbiting space station . There was speculation that the second ship had a restartable engine that would push the joined ships as far out as 50,000 miles-a first step toward a flight later this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Unlucky 15 . The rumors were given credence by Soyuz 's name ( it means " union " ) and its initial low and nearly circular orbit , which appeared to be designed to make Soyuz an easier rendezvous target . Also , the orbit 's 51.5 inclination to the equator was close to the 51 parking-orbit inclination previously used by unmanned Russian moon probes . <P> Having piloted Voshkod 1 in 1964 , Cosmonaut Komarov was the first Russian to soar into space twice . According to Western experts who tracked Soyuz and monitored its messages , he spent the early hours of his flight routinely checking out the systems of his 15,000-lb. to 16,000-lb. ship , which was slightly larger than the 12,000-lb . Apollo . But by the cosmonaut 's fifth revolution around the earth , they believe , increasing difficulties with both the attitude-control and communications systems warned ground controllers that the flight of Soyuz might have to be prematurely ended . Plans for a rendezvous were abandoned , and the launch of the second spacecraft was scrubbed . <P> Although the Russians have so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran into real trouble on the 15th orbit , when an attitude thruster misfired , sending Soyuz tumbling wildly . It was the same kind of malfunction that nearly proved disastrous to America 's Gemini 8 . <P> Struggling with his controls , Komarov apparently tried to abort his mission on both the 16th and 17th revolutions , which took him close to his planned landing site in central Russia . But Soyuz was probably still tumbling , and Komarov could not use his retrorockets . Unless an orbiting spacecraft is stabilized and properly oriented when the retrorockets are fired , it can shoot farther into space or re-enter the atmosphere improperly and burn up .
