THE LONDON STAGE <P> For more than three centuries , one man had despotic power to decide what plays would or would not appear on the public stage in Britain . As the royal censor , the Lord Chamberlain could summarily order an offending word , line or scene stricken from a script , or he could ban a play altogether by refusing to license it for performance . Although blue-penciling has eased in recent years , English playwrights have persistently demanded total dramatic freedom , and last July Parliament abolished the Chamberlain 's licensing authority . Two weeks ago , the U.S. folk-rock musical Hair became the first play publicly staged in London without a censor 's license since the beginning of the 17th century . <P> The end of official censorship was greeted with rejoicing by the London theater ; last week there was a mock-serious funeral service for the royal censor in Chelsea . Meanwhile , Hair 's actors executed what one critic called " a triumphal dance over the grave of the Lord Chamberlain . " High time . With offices in the Palace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior officer of the royal household . Yet he and his four readers have also played the role of arbiters of public taste , passing judgment on some 800 new scripts each year . Their esthetic qualifications have been uncertain at best . The present Lord Chamberlain , Lord Cobbold , 64 , is a former governor of the Bank of England . Cobbold is generally respected for his liberal views on what is dramatically permissible , but many of his predecessors have been less enlightened . George Bernard Shaw once complained that the Lord Chamberlain " robs , insults , and suppresses me as if he were the Czar of Russia . I must submit in order to obtain from him an insolent and insufferable document the license which I can not read without boiling of the blood . " <P> Godless Actors . England 's play censorship was established during the 16th century in order to stamp out Catholic stage resistance to the Reformation , as well as to protect the people from the bad influence of actors , who were generally held to be godless degenerates . Licensing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Prime Minister Robert Walpole grew so outraged by the political lampoons of Henry Fielding that he forced through a new censorship law . Since then , the Lords Chamberlain have had unchallengeable authority to ban plays by Ibsen ( Ghosts ) , Shaw ( Mrs. Warren 's Profession ) , Pirandello ( Six Characters in Search of an Author ) , Arthur Miller ( A View From the Bridge ) and Tennessee Williams ( Cat on a Hot Tin Roof ) . The most notable modern playwright to run afoul of the Lord Chamberlain is John Osborne . One of his plays dealing with homosexuality , A Patriot For Me , was banned entirely ; * almost every one of his scripts has had to be heavily laundered before the censor would give his approval . <P> There may be some unexpected hazards in London 's new stage freedom . The Lord Chamberlain 's approval once virtually guaranteed a play immunity from lawsuits . But with that protection gone , playwrights face a bewildering maze of common-law provisions against obscenity , sedition , blasphemy and libel , not to mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of licensing could lead to new restrictions , imposed by theater owners worried about possible prosecutions .
