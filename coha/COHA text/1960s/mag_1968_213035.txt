In a rare visit to the U.S. , that pioneering lady of psychoanalysis , Anna Freud , 71 , delivered some gloomy words on the state of the science at the New York Psychoanalytic Society 's annual Freud lecture , named after her father who started it all 70 years ago . Psychoanalysis , observed Anna , seems to be in sharp decline among those it should be helping most , those in the younger generation most confused about self and life .

So no one could blame Cosmopolitan magazine for seeking out a fresh face- and a pretty one at that-to cover politics for its lady readers . Armed with a note pad and a camera Actress Candice Bergen , 22 , is heading for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first leg of her new assignment to report on the candidates in the Oregon primary . " I did n't even know what a primary was , " admits Candy . Still , writing is what she likes to do most ( she 's published articles in Esquire and Vogue ) , and be sides , " I think it 'll be fun .
