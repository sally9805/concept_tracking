THE ECONOMY <P> Meeting to ponder the U.S. economy , twelve experts gathered under the auspices of the National Industrial Conference Board , emerged with predictions of a brisk first half , a slower second half , and for the year as a whole a satisfactory expansion in spite of unsettled periods . In summary , like 1967 , it will be " another year of worrisome , uneasy prosperity . " <P> First-Half Bulge . In its chronology , however , the new year will be almost a complete reversal of 1967 , when a mini-recession created sluggish first and second quarters before the economy began to come back . During first-and second-quarter ' 68 , the NICB forum agreed , auto sales will rebound from effects of the Ford strike and other auto-industry slowdowns . Auto production , plus some stockpiling of steel in anticipation of a steel industry strike , will keep mills humming . <P> The experts considered it inevitable that the momentum would decrease in the second half . Altogether , businessmen facing higher taxes and costlier credit will be spending about $85 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than they invested last year . The G.N.P . will grow 7.5% from an estimated $784 billion to $842 billion on a seasonally adjusted basis , but only half the increase will be real . The rest will be higher prices caused by what NICB Economist Martin R. Gainsbrugh* described as a move " from creeping to cantering inflation " and due directly , the economists agreed , to " fiscal deficits of tremendous proportions . " <P> Fix-Up Work . The inflation , however , should diminish somewhat by midyear and the overall increase in the consumer price index , as a result , will be about 3.4% . Steadier prices plus high employment-but with younger unskilled workers a drug on the market-could put the consumer in a spending mood , depending on tax increases . Consumer spending on goods and services will increase during the year , with the greatest increase-7.5% to an average $218 billion-again in the service area . Housing expenditures should reach about $27 billion by the fourth quarter , or roughly the same as last year , but could go higher if mortgage money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will decide to renovate older houses , and there will be a further increase in what the Bank of America 's Hoadley calls " fix-up " work . <P> The NICB forum , which has been unusually accurate in 22 years of such forecasts , warns that three factors temper optimism about 1968 . One is the fact that it is a presidential election year , when the economy often holds up its growth temporarily to await the outcome of the voting . Another is the federal surtax , which the panel expects to come and which will affect both profits and personal spending . The most difficult factor to gauge is defense spending , which is due to rise during the year about $7 billion to $80 billion . Were peace to be negotiated in Viet Nam , the economy would swing to a vastly different peacetime basis . In the event of a broader war , not only would defense outlays increase even more , but inflation would switch from a canter to a gallop . <P>             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
