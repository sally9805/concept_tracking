The grand old man of U.S. life insurance turned 80 last week , took time out to enjoy a birthday dinner at Manhattan 's Union Club and to admire the hundreds of cards that festooned the bottle-green walls of his office in the Empire State Building . But otherwise , it was another working day to Julian S. Myrick . One of the best salesmen in the business , he has sold more than a million dollars ' worth of insurance a year for the past two years to qualify for the Million Dollar Round Table , the profession 's highest honor , attained last year only by 2,688 of the nation 's 250,000 fulltime life-insurance salesmen . <P> To keep in selling trim , Myrick begins each day with a 45-minute workout with 2-lb. dumbbells and Indian clubs , plays tennis three times a week . He gave up smoking cigars in 1924 , quit chewing them in 1959 , and hardly ever takes a drink until sundown . Then he drinks up to five martinis , often takes wine with the main course and brandy afterward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pioneered some important changes in the insurance business . In 1910 he helped found the first training school for agents , later initiated the concept of estate planning . He helped set up the American College of Life Underwriters , the degree-granting agency for life-insurance salesmen , and has served as the college 's board chairman for the past 20 years . <P> Meet the Queen . Julian Myrick started out in the insurance business as a $25-a-week applications clerk in 1898 , soon struck up a friendship with another clerk , an athlete , organist and composer from Yale named Charles Ives . In 1907 they established their own office , soon were selling nearly $2,000,000 a year . <P> In after-hours Myrick and Ives achieved distinction in other fields as well . Ives wrote atonal , craggy symphonies and tone poems full of early American nostalgia ( Three Places in New England , The Concord Sonata , Symphony No. 3 ) which won him a Pulitzer Prize and recognition as one of the leading U.S. composers . Says Myrick : " He always said his business helped his music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Association in the early ' 20s , also headed the Davis Cup Committee whose teams won the cup six years in a row . Once when touring with the 1924 Olympic team , Myrick flattered the Queen of Spain into a doubles match ( Queen Victoria , with Vincent Richards , beat Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman and Myrick ) . <P> Consultation . At one time Myrick , who is married and has four daughters and a son , actually retired from the insurance business . In 1949 he stepped down from a vice-presidency of the Mutual of New York to help Herbert Hoover , an old friend , enlist public support for the Hoover Commission 's recommendations for organizational changes in the Federal Government . When that job was finished , Myrick longed for something else to do , decided to go back to his old sales agency as a consultant . " But , " says Myrick , " nobody consults you about insurance . You have to go out and consult them . " At present Myrick sees no chance of getting out of the insurance business . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says brightly , " but then they come to me with a problem , and I give them a simple answer-only yes , no , or maybe-and then they always ask me to stay on a little longer .
