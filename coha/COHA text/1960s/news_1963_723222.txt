txt Governor Rockefeller said yesterday that it was obvious someone was not telling the truth about the selection of a Republican candidate for councilman at large in Manhattan . The Governor denied emphatically that he had insisted that Richard S. Aldrich , his cousin , receive the nomination . Mr. Rockefeller said he had taken neither a positive nor a negative stand on the candidacy of Mr. Aldrich . " It is the responsibility of the county organization to make the selection , not mine . " Mr. Rockefeller declared . He repeated that he had so informed Vincent Albano , New York County Republican chairman , on two occasions . The Governor 's statement conflicted with one made in Washington by Representative John V. Lindsay , the influential Republican who represents the 17th ! Congressional District . Lindsay Tells of Talk Mr. Lindsay has supported Richard Lewisohn , Republican leader of the Ninth Assembly District , for the nomination . He said : " Last week the New York Republican county chairman told me that the Governor wanted his cousin to have the Republican nomination for City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deliver it , " In a statement later in the day , Mr. Albano said : " ' Mr. Lindsay has undoubtedly misinterpreted my conversation with him . I did inform him that I was determined that the designation be left to the executive committee . " The county executive committee , made up of 31 district leaders , is scheduled to meet next Monday at 5 P. M. at the Astor Hotel . Primary Fight Expected Mr. Albano indicated that he expected a primary fight for the councilman - at - large nomination . The primary election is to be held Sept. 5 . He said the Republican organization can1 didate would be selected " in democratic fashion by the executive committee , " and added : " This , of course , does not preclude any other potential candidate from entering the primary . " The Republican choice is virtually certain to be elected because the new City Charter permits a vote for only one candidate and allows parties to name only one candidate for the two councilmen-at-large seats in each of the five boroughs . Mr. Lewisohn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary ! twit . Supporters of Mr. Lewisohn have asserted that most of the 31 district leaders have indicated a preference for him . Representive Lindsay reaffirmed his support for Mr. Lewisohn yesterday . " As long as Mr. Lewisohn wishes to be a candidate , I will support him , " he said . 1 He reported that Mr. Albano I had asked him to help in persuading Mr. Lewisohn to " get out of the race . " " I have great respect for the Governor and the county chairman and for their political judgment , " Mr. Lindsay said , " and I suggest that they speak to Mr. Lewisohn rather than me . " Mr. Lewisohn said last night that neither the Governor nor Mr. Albano had been in touch with him since the dispute arose . Mr. Lindsay emphasized that his statement on the situation had been made only in response to repeated questions from newspapers about what Mr. Albano had said to him and asked him to do .

" A reporter read the statement in which Mr. Lindsay said that Mr. Albano had informed him that the Governor wanted Mr. Aldrich to have the nomination and that Mr. Albano " would have to deliver it . " " Someone is not telling the truth here , " the reporter observed . " Well , that is obvious , " the Governor replied . " Who do you think it is ?
