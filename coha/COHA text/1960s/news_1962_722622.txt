txt El Paso , Tex. , Aug. 24-The experimental rocket built by the amateur rocket society of Lane Technical High school , Chicago , went bang today on the launching pad . Difficulties with the fuel caused a malfunction that destroyed the missile . The end of the experiment at Fort Bliss came after the army 's ordnance experts had joined with the rocketeers to improvise launching and firing equipment after the failure of the originally designed ignition system . The explosion on the launcher today came after four separate attempts at ignition , each with a progressively higher electrical charge to the igniter . Never Leaves Ground On the final countdown , under the direction of Maj. Joseph J. Jones , range operations officer , 110 volts from a diesel electric generator system on site 20 flashed thru the 500 feet of igniter wire . There was a heavy explosion and parts of the missile were seen to be flying right and left from the launcher , but it did not leaves the ground . The boys and the ordnance disposal agents at the range agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignited at any time , and the explosion occurred only in the igniter . " Because of difficulties on Thursday , " Maj. Jones said , " we arranged with the approval of the Lane group to prepare an alternate ignition system for their rocket . What we actually used were four igniters and the associated powder from a NikeHercules guided anti-aircraft missile . We felt this would assure generation of sufficient heat to get the rocket 's fuel burning . " We did not know exactly the composition of the rocket fuel because , as we understand it , this was provided to the rocketeers by a commercial propellant manufacturer . The results on the pad indicated that this fuel was considerably more inert than we had anticipated , and the charge that was intended to ignite it merely served to blow off the nose cone and forward pressure bulkheads and destroy the missile . Learn Several Lessons " It was really too bad , because the boys had produced a very nice experimental rocket and what happened out here really had nothing to do with their work . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ay. , a June graduate of Lane , who has been a rocket society member there for three years , spoke for the other boys after the blast . He said : " We 're very disappointed , of course , but this thing was an experiment and we regarded it this way all of the time . There are several lessons that are obvious to us from this experience , one of which is that we must prepare ourselves with much more complete information on the propellants we use , and some study of igniters is indicated . " The next time we will bring three complete missiles . " Got Aid from Experts John Eckl , the faculty sponsor from Lane , who is with the four Youths here , said that manufacturing three complete rockets would not be very much more difficult than making one , once the design was crystalized . Brig . Gen. Stephen M. Mellnik , commanding officer at Fort Bliss and commandant of the air defense school here , gave the Lane group the full facilities of the army during their stay . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge and granted unlimited assistance from experts on the range and in the shops of this installation . One of the difficulties of the trip was the loss of the launching equipment designed by the boys and manufactured at Lane . It was not delivered by the railroad freight agency ' til after the shoot today , but welders in the shop fabricated a very sturdy a n d practical launcher out of discarded material from the dumps here . This launcher withstood the blast but a part of its base plate was torn . Start Back to Chicago Eckl , Nieglos , and the others in the group , Charles Marantz Jr. , 16 , of 6821 N. Ashland ay. : Nicholas Gruin , 16 , of 2434 W. Warner ay. ; Hugo Schuliz , 16 , of 2104 W. Cullom ay. : and Eckl 's son , Chris , 12 , will begin driving back to Chicago late today . They are bringing with them all the parts of the rocket and a part of the solid fuel billet . Most of the fuel was recovered and will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section is being returned to Chicago for analysis .
