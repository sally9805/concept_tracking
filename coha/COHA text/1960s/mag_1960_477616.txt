The first of two articles by GEORGE R. LEIGHTON Stately pleasure domes , palaces of commerce and of art , and the glorious honky-tonk of the midway have lifted the spirits of hard-bailed promoters , do-gooders , and dreamers for more than a century of the biggest-shows-on-earth . Why have some succeeded and others been catastrophes ? Here are some tips for Mr. Moses .. and for everyone who loves a fair . FOR Mr. Robert Moses the New York World 's Fair of 1964-65 opens the prospect of a burst of sunset glory . The appointment comes to him at the age of seventy-one , when his talent , zeal , energy , pride , irascibility , and capacity for making enemies are undiminished . Before him is the opportunity to put a diamond crown on his career . He was the landlord of the World 's Fair of 1939 . He wrote the terms under which the city leased the Flushing Meadow tract ? then largely a dump ? to the promoters . In nine months three shifts of men , working around the clock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bog was drained , filled , and land-scaped . The boulevards were laid out , the waterworks and sewage system completed . ( Later , just before the fair opened , the Whitestone Bridge was completed and thrown in as a sort of international exposition bonus . ) The site prepared . Mr. Moses handed over the tract to the promoters . Flushing Meadow ceased to be a dump in 1939. 1964 , we suppose , will see it turned into a glory . Still , Mr. Moses is going to find out that being boss of a world 's fair is different from being its landlord . World 's fairs have generally left behind them memorials in the shape of art galleries , museums , esplanades , plazas , fountains , and so on . But the memorials are not the important thing . A world 's fair is its own excuse . It is a brief and transitory paradise , born to delight mankind and die . Mr. Moses will have to deliver this glory if he is going to get his diamond crown . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests Cotton Mather on a bender . How Moses railed at Billy Rose 's electric Aquacade signs in 19391 Let him recall how the London Spectator denounced the Eiffel Tower at the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1889 as a " wasteful eccentricity . " In a heartfelt spirit of co-operation , may I offer President Moses two pieces of advice ? Here they are : ( 1 ) Have enough free toilets . In the 109 years since the first world 's fair of all ? " The Crystal Palace , " in 1851 ? the free toilet has been a burning issue . During those 109 years of world 's fair history , exposition managers slowly learned that enough free drinking fountains and enough free places to sit down were essential . But to this day the free toilet problem remains . As opening clay draws near , the harassed management ? having spent millions and wondering whether they will ever get any of it back ? begin to cut the corners . Somehow the budget cutters always find comfort in cutting clown the number of free toilets . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in exchange for the privilege of installing double the number ? or more ? of pay toilets . To yield to such tyranny is disastrous . The management of the San Francisco International Exposition of 1915 abjectly admitted their blunder . So did the management of the Chicago Century of Progress in 1933 . Yet Grover Whalen , President of the New York World 's Fair of 1939-40 , dismissed the free toilet as a " small " problem and airily referred to it as " The Battle of the Turnstiles . " He seemed to see no connection between this " small " problem and the fact that King George VI , finding himself in extremis , broke up the royal reception at Flushing Meadow . ( 2 ) There is one other point which Mr. Moses will do well to bear in mind : A world 's fair is a law unto itself . PRINCE ALBERT 'S WONDERFUL INVENTION A TRUE world 's fair has to try to take in the world and " every " occupation and interest of mankind . There have been trade fairs for centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been international exhibitions , of art , of science , of horticulture , of industry . They are not world 's Fairs . There have been national exhibitions . They are n't world 's fairs either . Each world 's fair picks up where the last left off , no two have ever been exactly alike , but an examination of the genesis of the first one gives a tolerably clear idea of what is involved in all . Long before the Crystal Palace of 1851 , an organization in Britain called " The Society of Arts " had been trying to bring about a junction of manufacture and artistic design . If Josiah Wedgwood could design and manufacture beautiful pottery , and if the Adam Brothers could design and build beautiful houses and furniture , why could n't all British manufacturers unite the aesthetic and the useful ? When Albert of Saxe-Coburg arrived in Britain to become the husband of Queen Victoria , he began to concern himself with a variety of enterprises devoted to the improvement and edification of mankind . The Society of Arts was one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man named Henry Cole , a talented busybody who spent a great deal of his time in pushing aesthetic projects . He was well aware that the French had made a success of national exhibitions which , at one and the same time , promoted their trade and their self-esteem as the most civilized of human beings . Cole told Prince Albert that the prizes offered by The Society of Arts , their exhibitions , their blandishments toward British manufactures , did n't go far enough . What would happen if one combined the French idea and the Society 's idea ? Albert was much struck with Cole 's suggestion . Bur there was , plainly , more involved than that . Albert was acutely conscious of man 's duty toward man . " Shall we to men benighted the lamp of life deny ? " No ! if people from distant climes were brought together under happy and peaceful circumstances , would not that promote international understanding and good will ? A group was formed , with Albert at the head , to manage the enterprise and invitations were broadcast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly called " The Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations " ) was the result . The sensation was tremendous ; London was thronged from every quarter of the globe . And ever since then world 's fairs have delighted and enchanted mankind . Albert was jubilant over the success of his great idea . The trouble was that , like so many inventors , he did n't quite understand what he had done . His moral purpose was clear . ( On the cover of the Crystal Palace catalogre were the words : " The Earth is the Lord 's and all that therein is , the compass of the world and t hey that dwell therein . " ) But scarcely had the Crystal Palace closed its doors when Europe was shaken by the Crimean War . Apparently world 's fairs were not going to guarantee international concord . The correspondent of the New York Times at the George R. Leighton , who was formerly associate editor of " Harper 's " and is now consultant to the Interstate Commerce Commission , is the author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , social , and economic history of the ! ' nit d States . His articles this month and next are part of his forthcoming history of world 's fairs , a hitherto unexplored field . Exposition UniNerselle of 1867 concluded that the reason why the Emperor Napoleon III had so little to say on opening day was that he was n't sure but what the Prussians might blow up the works . Spaniards came in shoals to the World 's Columbian Exposition of 1893 at Chicago , but that did n't prevent the Spanish-American War . The New York World 's Fair of 1939-40 spanned the Nazi march into Poland and the crumbling of the Maginot Line . It was only gradually that some of the world 's fair moralists began to realize that international expositions do not prevent wars ; they go on despite wars . They do n't solve the problems of depression and unemployment ; they persist in the face of depressions . The world 's fair idea is tough and durable , and the reason is this : people think they 're just wonderful . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightmare in the American Middle Vest . The Trans-Mississippi Exposition at Omaha ( in 1898 ) was begun at the lowest point of this depression as a desperate expedient that might ease the trouble . Luck was with it , if not understanding , and the fair was a great success . Why , just look ! There , on the platform , was Mark Hanna 's " Advance Agent of Prosperity , " William McKinley , himself . " Every barn in Kansas has got a new coat of paint . " Again : In November 1914 the French government fled to Bordeaux , seeking a refuge from the invading German army . Summoned by Delcasse , the Foreign Minister , the cabinet huddled together to consider what should he done about the French pavilion , planned in happier days for the Panama-Pacific International Exposition at San Francisco . Behind them was ruin . All around was desolation . No one could tell what the morrow might bring . No matter ! here was the American agent , awaiting their decision . Alinns , enfants ! The decision was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two nations above all have demonstrated surpassing talent in the conduct of world 's fairs : - France and the United States . During the past century there have occurred some twenty international expositions of the first rank ( in addition to scores of smaller ones ) and the larger number of the great shows have been held in these two countries . Their methods of organization arc diametrically opposed . In France the parliament decrees that there shall be a world 's fair and fixes the date . Then comes the guarantee of the subsidy . Then comes the City of Paris with another subsidy . Then comes the appointment of the Director-General " who is really a sort of Minister of the Interior with the equivalent of cabinet rank . " The trade associations , professional bodies , and individual participants bring up the rear . In the United States the process is reversed . An American world 's fair begins as a local enterprise , organized as a corporation , with initial capital from the sale of world 's fair bonds . The locals want money and support from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Next , they want the home state to come in with more money and support . This takes time , but the state does its duty . Finally , the promoters go to work on the federal government and here the real agony begins . CONGRESS AND THE NUDE R 0 M the very beginning , with few excep- tions , our government has regarded world 's fairs with suspicion . For years the Congressional cry was : " Get the government out of the sideshow business . " In 1851 the most that Millard Fillmore 's Administration would do was supply a vessel to carry over the exhibits . A crew dumped them on the wharves at Southampton and left them there . Outraged , George Peabody , the American banker in London , put up the money to bring the exhibits to London and then paid to have the American section of the Crystal Palace decorated . Franklin Pierce 's Administration did n't spend a nickel on the Paris Exposition of 1855 . When the Centennial of 1876 came around Senator Charles Sumner did everything he could to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sumner 's efforts were echoed by Congressman Adlai Stevenson of Illinois , grandfather of our esteemed fellow citizen . Federal dealings with the Chicago Fair of 1893 were scandalous . President Eisenhower was forced to send a special agent to Brussels in 1958 just to reassure the Congress that the American pavilion had n't been compromised by a picture of a nude lady . Senator Olin Johnston of South Carolina told his fellow Senators that the agent 's effort was " a classic example of locking the door after the horse has fled . What is needed more than an inspection trip is a thorough-going probe by Congress to determine how such a fiasco was allowed to come about in the first place and who is responsible for it . " This federal antagonism toward world 's fairs is curious , considering how successful Americans have been in conducting them . But that 's the way it is . Snarling and griping , dragging its feet , the government generally ends up by doing its duty , The promoters must have federal endorsement in order to get the official participation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually handle the details ; foreign exhibits " not for sale " enter the host country duty-free . ) The two hems that the locals want most of all from Washington are ( I ) an imposing federal structure at the exposition , housing a similarly imposing federal exhibit ; and ( 2 ) an appropriation for the promoters to spend on the exposition in any way they please . Not always this last . The 1933 Chicago Century of Progress asked for and got a handsome federal pavilion . They did not ask for a subsidy . There are lots of other things the promoters want . Sometimes it 's a commemorative postage issue . ( One of the most gorgeous philatelic jobs ever done was got up for the Chicago World 's Fair of 1893 . ) Sometimes it 's a commemorative coin . The promoters want the Marine Band . They want the Smithsonian to get busy . They want , generally , everything they can get their hands on . Strange though it may he , this combination of lobby and shakedown generally works out very well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pulling and hauling , the President comes and gives his benediction to the exposition , assuring one and all that international understanding will surely be one of the hr-products of the glorious show . The roles played by other nations in world 's fair history are curious . The British take the credit for the discovery ? the Crystal Palace of 1851 . In 1862 there was a second international exposition in London , but Prince Albert died and turned the occasion into mourning . The British never attempted it again . They have had Empire Exhibitions and Franco-British Exhibitions and so on , but never , since 1862 , a world 's fair . The Belgians , after a series of tries , finally covered themselves with glory . There were more than forty million paid admissions at Brussels in 1958 , the biggest crowd that ever attended a world 's fair . The Germans , familiar with trade fairs since the Middle Ages , have never had a real world 's fair . Nor the Russians . Next to the United States and France , Brazil and Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No sooner is one announced than a Brazilian and a Japanese delegation are on the ground , ready to sign up . True , both of these countries are intensely interested in export , but so are lots of other nations . Japan spent more money on our Centennial of 1876 than any other foreign nation . A contingent of Japanese artisans came to Philadelphia to erect the pavilion , with a royal commission along to superintend the work . One of Director General Goshorn 's most trying labor difficulties was how to prevent his men from downing tools to go and watch the Japanese . The Orientals used an ink block to mark their cutting lines instead of chalk and string . They had never seen a wheelbarrow and had difficulty in mastering it . As for the Brazilians , not only did they throw their money around at the Centennial . The Emperor Dom Pedro ( Brazil was not yet a republic ) came in person for the opening ceremonies . The Emperor was noted for his tact . He landed in New York on Saturday . On Sunday morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening he attended a Moody and Sankey revival meeting and sat on the platform . When the turn of the Brazilians came to celebrate their Centennial with a world 's fair in 1922 , the United States government for once showed that it understood the meaning of noblesse oblige . Not only did the Americans erect a splendid pavilion ( it was a permanent structure subsequently used to house the Embassy ) , but with guns booming and flags flying , Secretary of State Hughes was escorted into the harbor at Rio by two United States cruisers . SOME INTELLECTUALS WO N'T GET THE IDEA T IIERE is always a contingent of intellectuals who regard a world 's fair with supercilious disdain . Henry Adams was so appalled by the Paris Exposition of 1867 that he fled to Baden Baden to recuperate . He told Charles Gaskell that Paris was overrun with " hordes of low Germans , English , Italians , Spaniards , and Americans , who stare and gawk and smell . . .. I did not detect a single refined-looking being among them , but there may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drifted there by accident or necessity , " It would be hard to find a better illustration of the genteel tradition at bay . ( Though Adams changed his mind about world 's fairs later on . ) Richardson Wright , an articulate aesthete ? as S. S. Van Dine he wrote the Philo Vance detective stories ? took one look at the Paris Exposition of 1925 and declared that " it is very doubtful if the modernist movement , as applied to the home , ever gets a strong foothold in this i.e. , the United States country . " Before the year was out designs for tubular steel chairs were on their way around the world . Bruce Bliven told the readers of the New Republic that the Chicago 1933 Century of Progress was strictly a middle-class affair . " The poor ca n't afford to come ; the rich know better . . . . The perfect characterization of these worthy people , " said he , " is to be found in the fact that the popcorn sold at the fair is accompanied by a chemical analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly nourishing . No good Middle Westerner would eat popcorn just for fun . " This from a veteran of uplift ! Albert Mayer looked forward to the New York World 's Fair of 1939 with alarm because of the " soul-shattering discontinuity of the Chicago Century of Progress " and because of the influence of the Paris Exposition of 1925 , " meretricious on the whole . " His only hope lay in the efforts of a " voluntary " committee which had been formed to " reformulate objectives . " The trouble with the intellectuals is that they do n't know what a world 's fair is all about . A world 's fair is an art form , a combination of beauty and bombast , and is the expression of a complex idea involving trade , the arts . notional , local , and individual prestige , uplift , and the universal hankering for a holiday . There is a mystique involved with world 's fairs that defies analysis ; it recalls Isidor Rabi 's comment on modern physics : " We work with known laws in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world 's fair get started ? Many a world 's fair manager has confessed that he does n't know . Cole said that he happened to drop in at Buckingham Palace on the twenty-ninth of June 1849 , and told Prince Albert about his idea . Had Cole talked to anybody else beforehand ? Probably . Since Albert was so instantly receptive had he had ideas beforehand ? Quite likely . It appears that , at some moment , the idea for a world 's fair occurs to some one person . ( Robert Kopple , a New York lawyer , is credited with getting the idea for 1964 ? simply because he lrid enjoyed the New York fair of 1939-40 and wlmcd to make another and better one . ) This person presently discovers that another person just had the same idea . These two discuss their inspiration and then , suddenly , are overpowered with enthusiasm . Quivering with excitement , they tell their friends . Sooner or later the spark strikes the tinder . For one reason or another the times ( be they good or bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A manufacturer begins to see things at night . A member of the International Society for Universal Understanding begins to worry and ponder . An architect finds himself sketching pavilions on the back of an envelope . ( Paxton 's design for the Crystal Palace was first sketched on a piece of blotting paper . ) Somewhere some Sally Rand reaches for her fans . The ball starts to roll . It gathers momentum . Before people are aware of what has happened , a world 's fair is getting ready to be born . In the United States the fair is usually preceded by wrangling between municipalities over which one is to be the site . San Francisco almost had a collective nervous breakdown for fear New Orleans would get the price for the Panama Canal celebration . Then regional jealousy gets going and the press in towns that got left begin to assure the nation that Binghamton-on-theWabash was a hopeless choice and that the world 's fair there ca n't possibly be finished on time . But in the end , as with the federal government , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clone itself proud . In Europe things are handfed differently . Beginning in 1912 , efforts have been made to achieve international agreement on the frequency with which world 's fairs may be held , how a world 's fair is defined , and so on . But , outside of Europe and the British Commonwealth , few nations were willing to ratify the proposed treaty . ( The attitude of the United States and the Latin American republics was Phooey . ) So the office of the international exhibition bureau in Paris is , at intervals , the scene of complicated negotiations . There are acid remarks about tariffs , about the taxes to be laid on foreign participants . There is a great deal of hoity-toity . Then it all dissolves and here we go again . HOW TO OPEN ON TIME N OTHING can wreck a world 's fair but bad management and the marvel is that an able manager ( or managers , for sometimes they come in pairs ) is usually found . What is designed for the pleasure and delight of the visitor is murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talents to surmount the difficulties . No sooner had the Crystal Palace closed than the French hustled to put on a world 's fair of their own ? the Exposition Universelle of 1855 . In the process they discovered that the troubles that threatened to defeat the Crystal Palace ? quarrels over the site , architectural disputes , money , the dilatory tactics of exhibitors and foreign governments , and , above all , the acute question of time ? were not difficulties confined to the Crystal Palace . They are problems inherent in the conduct of any world 's fair . In general it may be said that you can not succeed with a world 's fair unless , in one shape or another , you have these three capacities available : a salesman , a planner who can alter details in stride , and a boss who can bull it through . At St. Louis in 1904 these talents were united in a single person , David R. Francis . In Paris in 1855 they were shared by Frederic Le Play , the economist , and General Jules Morin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1876 the responsibility was split between Mr. Goshorn , who bossed the fair , and John Welsh , the Chairman of the Finance Board . One of the mysteries of world 's fairs is the way in which the idea can seduce the management . Financial scandals are almost unknown . ( One of the few occurred at Vienna in 1873 . General Van Buren , the - United States Commissioner , was charged with selling memberships on the commission for $5,000 apiece and with conniving with a New York liquor house to import whiskey , duty-free , as an " exhibit " and then selling it over the American bars at the fair . The whole business was regarded as a national disgrace and United States Minister Jay , who had to clean up the mess , felt like a blighted being. ! The rule with world 's fairs seems to be : Lots of free-loaders but very few thieves . Grover Whalen was paid $100,000 a year for his labors as President of the New York World 's Fair of 1939 , and Robert Moses is going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fair boss has refused compensation altogether . Apparently it is because there arc opportunities for self-satisfaction that can be found nowhere else . Mrs. Howard Cullman says that her husband refused his $25,000 salary as United States Commissioner General at the Brussels World 's Fair of 1958 . Harlow Higinbotham , the partner of Marshall Field , quit his job to be the President of the Chicago World 's Fair of ' 93 . It almost killed him . He took no pay . But nothing in his whole life gave him such satisfaction . Everything that came after was anti-climax . David Francis took no pay for his work bossing the Louisiana Purchase Exposition . " I gave to the work five years or more of my time and thought , " he said . It is a sweet recollection , the Days of 1904 . Their memory lightens our cares , broadens our vision , rejuvenates our hearts . May it never grow dim . " In the long stretch , while the fair is being put together , the boss must be able to run a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crackpot schemes . He must deal with jealous politicians , crazy inventors , and crank clergymen . He must be a city planner on a good-sized scale , 34 WORLD 'S FAIRS putting his mind to water supply , sewers , paving , garbage disposal , and a police force long before these necessities are in demand . He must Hog the contractors , watch the exhibit managers . He begins with a handful of engineers and surveyors . He must end , during the last six months before the exhibition opens , by expanding his labor force by geometrical progression and jam the exposition through the final stages of preparation . " Open on time " is the idea that burns him night and day , and if he can be anywhere near ready on opening day , he is a genius . Allred Goshorn of the 1876 Centennial was just such a genius . SOME ALWAYS SHOW UP A GREAT deal of rubbish has been said about international education , " said John Hart , the New York World correspondent at the Vienna . International Exposition of 1873 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ' friendly intercourse , ' but the careful student is constrained to admit that the alpha and omega of world 's fairs is business , pure and simple . " Well , yes and no . Nothing is pure and simple about a world 's fair . No sooner had Hart set clown his statement than he was forced to amend it . " Are these gatherings of men and goods , " he asked , " in reality governed by laws of their own ? " The answer , again , is : Yes . The number of businessmen and manufacturers who have cold-shouldered world 's fairs , as trash and a waste of time and money , is legion . The number of industries that have exhibited at world 's fairs and then lost interest is legion also . But there is a third group that always shows up . The National Cash Register Company began to exhihit at the Melbourne World 's Fair in 1888 and has never stopped . ( The giant cash registers that display the daily attendance figures have been familiar sights at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago in 1893 and is still at it . ( It sent Benny Goodman 's band to Brussels in 1958 . ) The Bausch and Lomb Optical Company has been a world 's fair stalwart since 1876 . Gail Borden received the blessing of Napoleon III at Paris a hundred years ago ; Elsie Borden was on view at Flushing in 1939 . Wherever there is a world 's fair the Otis Elevator Company is likely to be found . Otis helped to build the Sky Ride at the Century of Progress in 1933 . At Paris , in 1900 , it exhibited the first escalator . ( Brought home , the escalator was put to work in Gimbels department store in Philadelphia and there it stayed until 1939 . ) The roster of the world 's fair faithful is a long one . It would seem as though trade , export , and public relations would be a simple explanation of their participation . But in numerous instances there is strong suspicion that an additional element is present : Somebody in the corporation is a world 's Fair zealot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let the bombast go . We may illustrate this with the strange case of Hiram G. Hotchkiss of Lyons , New York . In 1850 Mr. Hotchkiss was known to the trade simply as an extractor of the " essential oil " of the peppermint plant . There was no aura of glory about him . But , as the news of the Crystal Palace spread far and wide , mysterious voices spoke to Mr. Hotchkiss . Suppose he should send some of his peppermint oil to London ? And just suppose the international jury thought well of it ? Who could tell ? The jury did think well of it and awarded Mr , Hotchkiss a medal . That did id . For forty years thereafter the top hat and frock coat of Mr. Hotchkiss were standard sights at world 's fairs . It almost seemed as though he shared with Prince Albert the distinction of being a founding father of world 's fairs . One can almost hear the director general ( any of them ) asking anxiously : " Has Hiram got here yet ? " During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept a diary . Here is his account of the award ceremonies : President MacMahon is a Splendid looking old man about 6 feet high , stout build with a face as red as a beet but one of the finest looking men I ever see . The Prince of Wales looked very fine he is stout built , Sandy whiskers and mustash about 38 years old and I should think he was dressed in a magnificent unform he looked the Picture of health and seemed Very happy . He sat on the left of McMahon and all the other Princes sat on the right . The band played wonderfully . Singing wonderful , male and female . See Gov . McCormick decorated with the Legion of Honor . The weather was fine S. : in the evening the Streets were beautifully illuminated &; all the principal streets decorated with flags . GREAT ARE THE FRENCH . Is it any wonder that Mr. Hotchkiss renamed his business ? Long since he has departed for that paradise where the elect , like himself , walk The world was n't big enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair that knows no end . But to this day the H. G. Hotchkiss International Prize Medal Essential Oil Company is in business in Lyons , New York , happily engaged in distilling peppermint oil . The amusement area of the world 's fair got rather a slow start and then , suddenly , it burst into full bloom at the Paris Exposition in 1867 . ( According to the wiseacres the underground aquarium with all its stalactites was the inspiration for Jules Verne 's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea . ) In these precincts too , the world 's fairs appear to operate under laws of their own . World 's fair managers have studied the amusement problem over and over again and then given it up as a mystery beyond their understanding . ( This does not include world 's fair restaurants , lunch stands , and bars . The body of experience in this area is immense . ) A very few are tremendous successes . The rest are washouts . ( Harlow Higinbotham , the President of Chicago ' 93 , seemed to think that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concessionaires are " amateurs . " ) The number of " professionals , " like Thompson , the " Scenic Railway King , " is 36 WORLD 'S FAIRS small . But even the successes do not conform to rule . ) For example : Nudes are supposed to be sure fire . Sometimes yes , sometimes no . The most sensational attraction at the 1851 Crystal Palace was Hiram Powers ' nude statue of " The Greek Slave . " The Streets of Cairo was a French invention and first appeared in Paris in 1889 . It gave Little Egypt , the muscle dancer , to the world . Success ! The attraction was copied at Chicago in 1893 and mowed them down . But thereafter Little Egypt slowly lost her charm and nothing like her seemed to work until Sally Rand showed up at Chicago in 1933 . Then another reverse . Most of the nude shows at Flushing Meadow in 1939 were flops . The big attractions and their 1939 grosses were : Billy Rose 's Aqua-aide , $2,725,382 ; Mike Todd 's " Hot Mikado , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Parachute Jump , $218,354 . For some reason The Johnstown Flood was among the big draws at Buffalo in 1901 . Jerusalem and the Crucifixion did n't do badly . But you never can tell . Lambert , the " pharmacal " manufacturer of St. Louis and a number of his friends put a million dollars into another Jerusalem at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in 1904 and drew only 3170,000 for the entire season . On the other hand , The Boer War ? fought all over again every afternoon at St. Louis , with General Cronje , the Boer hero , as a star attraction ? was socko from the start . Many years have gone by since people began to wonder just how long this world 's fair mania could last . One international . exposition followed another . They became " bigger and better , greater and grander . " From a single huilding the ground plans gradually expanded to include separate national pavilions , elaborate amusement areas , and exhibit " palaces " of every kind . Perhaps one reason for the durability of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the cannon founders , the sculptors , the shell-game operators , the architects , the engineers , the schoolteachers , the strip teasers , the guys and the dolls . All , somehow , belong . At an international exposition , whatever the managerial agonies behind the scenes , anyone coming through the gate seems to belong there . ( What bitter hours world 's fair managers have spent in wrestling with " the free pass evil " ! ) The lion and the lamb lie down together . God and Mammon are reconciled for a summer . And , as at Brussels in 1958 , the Civitas Dei of the Catholic Church faces the Sputnik and the pavilion of the godless Russians without a tremor . In one way or another , a world 's fair is an architect 's holiday There are three periods of this in world 's fair history . During the first , from 1851 to 1889 , the appeal was made to ingenuity and novelty in design . During the second , from 1893 to 1922 , world 's fair architecture was dominated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 93 to turn the clock back . During the third , from 1925 until now , the " moderns , " the " internationalists " have had their way . During the hundred years of world 's fair history , at least three world 's fair structures of incomparable beauty and charm have been built ? and vanished . The first was Joseph Paxton 's Crystal Palace of 1851 . The second was the miraculous Hall of Machines at Paris in 1889 . ( A series of gracefully designed steel girders , fastened to the floor at almost a pin point , soared aloft to be so ingeniously locked together that the building could breathe ? expand and contract with changes in temperature . ) The third was Edward Stone 's United States pavilion in Brussels in 1958 . Other people have other opinions . At the Paris Exposition of 1889 the Figaro kept a sort of visitor 's book on the second platform of the Eiffel Tower in which sight-seers could write their names and impressions . The paper printed these day by day . Here is what they got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , c'est sublime . Meals elle n'atteint as la grandeur ni la profondeur de mon amour pour Georges . " NEVER-NEVER FINANCING N E thing is clear : The principal reason for the persistence of world 's fairs is their popular appeal . " Nobody loves world 's fairs but the people . " But what makes a world 's fair a " success " ? money or love ? World 's fair finance is , by all odds , the most esoteric branch of economics . When does a world 's fair show a profit ? Nobody knows . " They say " that it brought trade into New York despite the losses of the exposition of 1939-40 . It can not be shown . Harlow Higinbotham thought that he could hand back to the bondholders for Chicago ' 93 a tenth of what they had paid in . Gordon Wattles , the President of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition at Omaha , thought that he could pay back maybe 90 per cent . David Francis claimed that the Louisiana Purchase Exposition of 1904 showed a profit . The Chicago 1933 Century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bank balance , look at the post-exposition benefactions . But who knows ? No one will ever know how much Harlow Higinbotham spent out of his own pocket or David Francis either . What sort of bookkeeping governed the San Francisco management which persuaded an incinerator manufacturer to install a garbage-disposal plant as an " exhibit " and then jockeyed him into using the exhihii to incinerate the exposition trash free of charge ? The true success of a world 's fair lies in some never-never land . But the fact of the success is beyond dispute . It is somehow embalmed in the memory of those who were there . The Chicago Century of Progress ran for two years . A lady who visited the fair some three hundred times was shown a film of fair exhibits some months after the exposition was over . Her repeated comment was : " Where was that ? I never saw it . " Mrs. Carrie Sherwood of Red Cloud , Nebraska , is a world 's fair stalwart . " ' the wonderful thing about them , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are new . " That there is enchantment in a world 's fair ? despite the exhaustion , the tired feet , and the shortage of free toilets ? is clear . " I can not bear to see it end , " said Victoria , as the Crystal Palace neared its close . " Must we give it up so soon , this brief paradise , after a single summer ? " asked a poetical St. Louisian in 1904 . " It broke my heart that the American pavilion had to be destroyed , " said a visitor to Brussels in 1958 . " It was , I suppose , one of the most beautiful pieces of exposition architecture ever devised . At night , all lit up and glowing , it was like an enchanted palace . " This brief paradise ! Perhaps as good a demonstration as any of the power of the magnet survives in an anecdote from the New York World 's Fair of 1939 . On the evening of April 30 in that year , Mrs. Irene Mullen took a seven-year-oldl boy to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the complications and the agonies that had gone into its preparation . All they knew was that there was going to be a world 's fair and that they were determined to see it start . When the two had made their way Inn a short distance inside the ground they stopped , spellbound . All around them , bathed in a shimmering magic of light , was a marvel beyond anything either had ever seen . At length the boy said " Irene , what do you think ? " Mrs. Mullen paused , drew breath , and said : " John , it 's just like heaven . " Mr. Moses , if you can do as well in 1964 , your world 's fair will be a " success . "
