txt Senator Goldwater has made the nation 's morals and President Johnson 's ethics into almost his only domestic issue . He has tried to establish a direct relationship between the two . Although he has considerably oversimplified this relationship , the example that a President sets does matter and his personal ethics are a legitimate campaign topic . If Senator Goldwater bas made some headway with this issue , Mr. Johnson has only himself to blame . The President has shown marked insensitivity in failing to dispose of his radio and television holdings , which are part of a Federally regulated industry . His long association with Bobby Baker and his apparent tolerance of the latter 's money-making activities have naturally stirred a public uneasiness which Mr. Johnson could have set at rest if he had displayed more zeal for a thorough investigation . If President Johnson 's errors of omission have contributed to current public concern over this issue , however , Senator Goldwater has provided no solutions or positive programs to improve either the level of ethics within the Federal establishment or the standard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , as the history of the country amply demonstrates , neither party is conspicuously better than the other in moral terms . All a President can do is be vigilant and act decisively when scandals come to his attention , since under the best of circumstances the corrupting pressures on government are so strong that it is impossible to guarantee that no wrongdoing will ever occur . On the larger theme of the nation 's morals , the most striking aspect of Senator Goldwater 's position is the disjuncture between his stated principles and his specific policies . No connection at all seems to exist between the moral failures deplored by Goldwater the moralist and any legislative and political remedies expounded by Goldwater the politician . He refuses to view any moral problem in its social context . Thus he can deplore the violence in street demonstrations and never mention the long ordeal of the Negro 's struggle for equality and opportunity . He exalts self-reliance and says nothing of the urgent problems of the chronically unemployed or the aged trying to meet rising medical costs . Everyone is willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideals , that he is for individual freedom and for decorum in the home , order in the streets and peace in the world . But so is everybody else . The task of politics in any society is to reconcile freedom , justice and order . A political leader who leaves it to his audiences to imagine or infer how he is going to translate the dictates of his conscience into legislative programs and specific actions is shirking nine-tenths of his job . Senator Goldwater unconsciously exemplifies and caters to an old American stereotype . This is the stubborn illusion that the hard choices of politics can be evaded by simply electing a " good man " whose heart is in the right place . Senator Goldwater 's slogan ? " in your heart you know he is right " ? is no accident . In their minds most people know he is wrong because life is more complicated than he suggests . Complex social problems do not yield to the mere pronouncement of unobjectionable moral sentiments .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
