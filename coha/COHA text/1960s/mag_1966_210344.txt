" If I ever have to hide from the cops , " a fellow once said , " I have the spot picked out . I will try to win a position on a college crew , preferably in the center of the boat . " <P> You ca n't even hide there any more , pal - at least not at the University of Pennsylvania . John McGinn , an old Penn coxswain and now a scientist in General Electric 's laboratories at Valley Forge , Pa. , has invented an electronic gizmo that enables Penn Coach Joseph Burk to tell at a glance in practice which of his oarsmen are pulling their weight - and which are n't . Attached to the oarlocks , miniature dynamometers measure the pull on each oar , flash the results on a board of 32 lights - four for each crewman . If all four lights flash on , the oarsman is exerting 280 Ibs. of pressure . Three means 265 Ibs. , two means 240 Ibs. , and one means a bawling out . Burk calls the machine " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew 's success . Last year Penn 's varsity eight failed to win a single race ; going into last week 's Eastern Sprint championships at Lake Quinsigamond in Worcester , Mass. , their 1966 record was two for three . <P> Wizard or no wizard , the crew to beat at Worcester was Harvard - although Coach Harry Parker was as surprised at that as anyone . Parker had lost seven out of the nine men ( including the cox ) who rowed the Crimson to seven straight victories last year before losing to Germany 's Ratzeburg eight in England 's Henley Regatta . This year Harvard 's largely sophomore crew was unbeaten in three starts . Still , Parker complained , " My boys need time to develop . We have a long way to go . " <P> To be precise , they had exactly 78,740 inches to go at Worcester-and they stayed in front most of the way . There were five other college crews in the race , and all of them had a shot at the Harvard eight , which began rowing at a steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count to 41 , and opened up a 12-ft. lead at the 500-meter mark . For the rest of the race , the Crimson cox spent his time mostly looking over his shoulder . Harvard 's final margin of victory was 70 ft. over Brown , followed by Cornell , Yale and Princeton in that order . The wizards from Penn finished last . Back to the drawing board , McGinn.
