txt The Apollo II astronauts closed in on the moon early today on the third day of their historic landing attempt . Yesterday the Soviet Union gave assurance that its unmanned lunar-orbiting spaceship would not intersect the Apollo 's trajectory . Apollo II is scheduled to fire its rocket to swing into its own lunar orbit at 1:26 P.M. , Eastern daylight time , today . A televised inspection tour inside the attached lunar landing craft yesterday afternoon showed that its interior , like that of the command ship , was in apparently perfect working order . The landing is set to take place at 4:19 P.M. tomorrow . " Everything looks good down there , " said Col. Edwin E. Aldrin Jr . of the Air Force when he crawled through the connecting tunnel into the lunar module . Assurances by Keldysh Neil A. Armstrong , the civilian commander , accompanied Colonel Aldrin into the lunar module , while Lieut . Col. Michael Collins of the Air Force remained behind in the command ship he is to pilot when the two other men descend for their landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a cable i'from Dr. Mstislav V. Keldysh , president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences , to Col. Frank Borman , the Apollo 8 commander who recently returned from a Russian visit . " The orbit of Luna 15 , " Academician Keldysh said , " does not intersect the trajectory of Apollo II spacecraft announced by you in flight program . " From data the Soviet scientist provided , flight controllers here determined that Luna 15 was circling the moon . on a course ranging in altitudes from a low of 34.5 miles to a high of 126.5 miles . It completes a full orbit every 2 hours 30 seconds , swinging across the lunar equator at 45-degree angles . Apollo 11 is scheduled to go // first into an orbit 69 miles by 185.5 miles and then shift to a more circular orbit of 64 miles by 76 miles . It is to follow an equatorial course , completing a full orbit about every two hours . Christopher C. Kraft , director of flight operations , said that engineers here were " cranking " the figures into computers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would even come close to each other . Mr. Kraft said that it was unlikely that the Apollo 11 astronauts would have either the time or the opportunity to attempt to see the Luna 15 . It was Mr. Kraft who , after Luna 15 went into moon orbit Thursday , ? asked Colonel Borman to telephone the Russians for such information . Under the United Nations Outer Space Treaty of 1967 , which was established to preclude national appropriation of the moon and to avoid space mishaps. the United States and the Soviet Union are bound to furnish this type of data . This was the first time , as far as American space agency officials could recall , that the Soviet Union had communicated directly with the Americans about one of their missions while it was in flight . No Hint of Purpose In his cable , Academician Keldysh said Luna 15 would remain in its present orbit for two days ? starting at 5 A.M. Thursday . There was no hint as to the purpose of the flight or what its next steps might be . There has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet Union to land on the moon , scoop up some moon dirt and return it to the earth  --  thereby upstaging the Apollo II mission . " In case of further change in the orbit of the probe , " the Soviet cable said , " you will receive additional information . " Luna 15 was launched on its mysterious mission early Sunday morning . Apollo l I was launched from Cape Kennedy , Fla. , on Wednesday . Sound Sleep for All The astronauts awoke to the third day of their outward journey at about 9:30 A.M. after eight to nine hours of sound sleep . Unlike previous crews , the Apollo 11 men have had no trouble sleeping . " Good morning . Houston , " Colonel Aldrin radioed , before turning immediately to business . " How do all our systems look ? " Plight controllers , monitoring the steady stream of automatically radioed data from the spacecraft , assured the crew " they 're looking great . " At the time , Apollo 11 was within 73,000 miles of the moon , which was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was coasting at 2,400 miles an hour , rolling slowly to keep any one part from overheating by remaining too long in the intense , unfiltered sunlight that exists in space . When Colonel Aldrin looked out his window he could see North Africa and clouds casting a shadow from Afghanistan to Pakistan . " Everything 's getting smaller and smaller as time goes on , " the Air Force colonel commented . Lunar Module Inspected After the astronauts finished such housekeeping tasks as charging batteries , dumping waste water and checking fuel and oxygen reserves , Colonel Aldrin made his inspection tour of the attached lunar module . To do this , the astronauts had to open the hatch at the apex of the cone-shaped command ship . Mr. Armstrong then squeezed through the 30-inchwide tunnel and opened the hatch at the other end , clearing the way for Colonel Aldrich to enter the lunar module . The astronauts were beginning this operation when they went on the air with one of the clearest color television transmissions ever sent from space . The telecast began at 4:44 P.M. and ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveled 2,300 miles closer to the moon . Mr. Armstrong , wearing white flight coveralls , worked his way into the tunnel and fished out the so-called docking probe , the pointed plug-like device used in latching the command ship and the lunar module together . " Mike must have done a smooth job in that docking , " , Mr. Armstrong said . " There is n't a dent or a mark on the probe . " Colonel Collins steered the command ship on Wednesday , after launching , when the two vehicles were joined for their long journey nose to nose . The transmission was so clear that it was possible to read dials on the lunar module control panels and to read instruction labels at the point where the ships were joined . The lunar module , usually called the LM , is a two-stage vehicle that is part spacecraft and part rocket . The lower half of the 161/ , ton vehicle is the descent stage , containing the fuel and throttle able engine used to rocket down to a soft landing on the moon . Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When they descend to the moon , Colonel Aldrin and Mr. Armstrong will stand side by side at the controls of the cabin in the upper stage . That stage 's rocket engine will provide the thrust to boost the astronauts off the moon , leaving the descent stage behind as an artifact of man 's first visit to another world . Dimensions of LM The over-all height of the LM is 23 feet . Its over-all width is 14 feet , not counting the extended landing gear . This is the third manned flight of the LM . Its first test came in March on Apollo 9 , an earth-orbiting mission . Then , in May , the Apollo 10 crew flew it in lunar orbit swooping down to less than nine miles of the moon in a successful test of its rockets and guidance system . Yesterday once they were satisfied the LM was in good shape , Colonel Aldrin and Mr. Armstrong crawled back into the command ship , latching the two hatches behind them . At one point during the telecast , Colonel Aldrin focused the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Armstrong and Colonel Collins at the other end . " I can see Neil and Mike , " he said . " It 'd better be them . " Later , after the crew settled down for the night at 9:59 P.M. , Apollo 11 passed out - of the sphere where earth gravity dominates and came under the primary influence of lunar gravity at 11:12 P.M. yesterday . It began picking up speed from the pull of lunar gravity . Ahead , 39,000 miles away lay the moon , long the symbol of the inaccessible and now within reach as man 's first port-of-call in the new age of spacefaring . The first step on the moon , if all goes well , will be made by Mr. Armstrong early Monday . The scheduled time is 2:21 A.M. , but it could come earlier if the astronaut feels sufficiently rested and ready to take the walk . KELDYSH MESSAGE Following is the text of the cable to Col. Frank ' Borman from Academician Mstislay V. Keldysh , president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences : Reference your inquiry on flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that on July 17 at 130G Moscow time the probe was placed in selenocentric orbit with the following preliminary values of its elements : of revolution 2 hours , 30 seconds , eccentricity of orbit of 0:04 argument of pricentre position 60 degrees , declination to lunar equator plane 127 degrees , longitudinal of the ascending node counted from lunar zero meridian 280 degrees . It is supposed that in this orbit probe you will receive additional information . The orbit of probe Luna 15 does not intersect the trajectory of Apollo 11 spacecraft announced by you in flight program .
