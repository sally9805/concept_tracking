HOME : SOCIAL ESSAYS by LeRoi Jones . 252 pages . Morrow . $4 . <P> LeRoi Jones , 31 , is no relation to the Emperor Jones . But he would like to be . He noisily nurses plans for a fascist Black Nation in Harlem ; he howls destruction on all his foes , chief among whom are the Rev. Martin Luther King , the American Negro middle class , and absolutely all white men everywhere . In his 1964 play , The Toilet , Jones gave painful promise of developing gifts as a writer . In this disjointed collection of essays , the promise is flatly withdrawn . Jones clings raptly to his privileged role as victim , and has settled for a career as blackwash expert . He modestly admits to black sexual superiority : " Most American white men are trained to be fags . " Insult , in fact , is his single weapon : " The American policeman is the foulest social category in the world today . " " The white man , at this point in history , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His solutions are disarmingly simplistic : " When those four children were killed in the Birmingham bombing of Sept. 15 , 1963 , the U.S. Steel plant in that city should have been shut down by Negroes . A general strike should have been called . That city should have died , should have been killed by Negroes . " <P> " There is only one people on the planet who can slay the white man . The people who know him best . His ex-slaves . " LeRoi Jones could be accused of inciting to violence-if anyone , white or black , were still listening . <P> DEATH IN MIDSUMMER AND OTHER STORIES by Yukio Mishima. 181 pages . New Directions . $5.50 . ( Paperback $2.25 . ) <P> Bestselling Author Yukio Mishima can write no wrong-at least in his native Japan . There he has briskly blended sensation and sensibility in 16 novels , 30 plays , and 80 short stories . Nine of these have now been issued in fluid , faultless English translation . In Onnagata , a dedicated Kabuki actor who plays only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls in love with a nasty new-wave director . In Patriotism , a dis graced lieutenant and his wife rapturously relax in a last voluptuous night together-and discover that after such pleasures , hara-kiri hurts even harder . In the title tale , a young mother whose little son and daughter have recently drowned reluctantly realizes that her heart is not broken , impatiently longs for her own death as the only remaining event of possibly equal interest . Deft in execution , ironic in tone , the stories serviceably sustain Author Mishima 's reputation as a sure and showy craftsman .
