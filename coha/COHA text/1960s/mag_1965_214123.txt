" Forty years ago , the idea of there being a great English sculptor was as remote as a Hottentot becoming prime minister of Scotland , " says one British artist . Today Great Britain has become a hotbed of new sculptors , with three museum shows in London currently devoted to their renaissance . Miraculous as the new flowering appears , the sculpture bloom began in the 1930s , when British artists found the seeds for their ideas on the Continent from such sources as Brancusi , Archipenko and Picasso , repotted their findings in good English earth , and began producing a hardy native growth . <P> Off Their Pedestals . The oak towering above all is Henry Moore ( TIME cover , Sept. 21 , 1959 ) . Around him have now sprung a turbulent group of younger sculptors . First to appear in the immediate postwar years were Reg Butler , Kenneth Armitage and Lynn Chadwick , whose vaguely figurative iron and bronze forms spoke to stress , anxiety and despair . Succeeding them is another generation that reacts against what one , Anthony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art . " The wraps are off , the postures have come down from their pedestals and plinths , and the new British sculptors ( see following color pages ) are forging ahead in tough , cool and iconoclastic experimentation . <P> The youngest of the post-Moore sculptors reject a moody image of man just as they have abandoned casting in bronze . They use plastics and Fiberglas to create exuberant forms that often intrude into the provinces of painting . Cambridge-educated Phillip King , 30 , a devoted student of Moore 's , wants to " open up volume , " and in works such as Twilight , he knifes apart space with hard , bright edges . <P> A counterpart is Oxford-taught William Tucker , also 30 , who switched from painting to sculpture after seeing Moore . Tucker strips the image to its irreducible core , colors his work to give clues to its form , but abstracts it to the point where it would connote almost anything or nothing . He agrees with King that " five years ago , sculpture was still nihilist and negative . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're not afraid of words like beauty , joy and pleasure . " <P> The Stressful Present . Two leaders of the new generation are Eduardo Paolozzi and Anthony Caro , both 41 . Paolozzi turned from golem grotesques of junkyard assemblages of gears and bolts to hand-tooled totems , such as Artificial Sun , which are unthreatening icons to a world that accepts machine culture willingly . Caro , a Cambridge engineering graduate , worked with Moore for two years until " I 'd come to feel that bronze was using me . " So he began welding elegant elongated girderwork in steel instead of making " people substitutes " in bronze . <P> There still are those who adhere to the permanence of cast metal . Michael Ayrton , 44 , has painted for 29 years , but Moore got him to sculpt as well . Impassioned by Greek mythology , he wonders " what happens when you are partly animal and want to become wholly human . " He makes his misshapen minotaurs , therefore , into symbols for man 's stressful present . Bernard Meadows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also produces bronzes suggestive of figures withdrawn into abstraction . Tough , crablike carapaces cover highly polished softer forms like defenses for a vulnerable humanity .
