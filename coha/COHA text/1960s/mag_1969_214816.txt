One of the top commercial accolades in the music business is a gold record , signifying that a given release has had retail sales of $1,000,000 or more . In the pop field , goldies are a dime a dozen , but in the 21-year history of LP , there have been only five million-dollar classical bestsellers . Three of them - The Glorious Sound of Christmas , the Messiah and The Lord 's Prayer - were made by the Philadelphia Orchestra , * a top seller down through the years , and the most-recorded orchestra in the U.S. Small wonder , then , that it finds itself right in the middle of one of the fiercest , most extraordinary competitive battles the record industry has ever known . <P> For 25 years , Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia recorded exclusively for Columbia Records . Last May , when the orchestra 's contract came up for renewal , RCA , which had recorded it from 1917 to 1943 , grabbed the ensemble off by outbidding Columbia . Even though RCA now has exclusive rights to the Philadelphia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never lost the orchestra at all . As of March , Columbia had issued ten new releases , and this month it released four more , with a $65,000 promotion and advertising campaign to back it up . These were all items recorded by Columbia while the Philadelphia still worked for it . Columbia also says it has about 40 more unreleased recordings in its vaults - including all the orchestral works of Brahms , one Bruckner symphony , and two albums with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir . Says Columbia Artists and Repertory Music Director Thomas Frost : " We have so much material in the can that we can release new records by Ormandy and the Philadelphia regularly for the next five years - and that is exactly what we intend to do . " <P> No Backlog . There is a good reason why RCA signed up the Philadelphia : it desperately needed a big-name orchestra on its roster . The Boston Symphony , a big seller in the days of Serge Koussevitzky , has not done nearly so well under Conductor Erich Leinsdorf . Columbia has two other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Leonard Bernstein , and George Szells Cleveland Orchestra . RCA 's winning bid was a reported $340,000-a-year royalty guarantee over the next five years . That is a lot of money , but RCA thinks it has a very good chance not only of recovering its costs , but of coming out ahead as well . <P> It may take a while . The Philadelphia 's highest yearly earnings with Columbia were $400,000 in 1963 , but its recent average has been $300,000 . Columbia estimates that 80% of those royalties have come from the backlog of more than 200 old releases built up over the years ; new records have accounted for only 20% . Not only that ; RCA can not record anything in the Columbia catalogue until five years after its release .
