 | What Your Child Really Wants to Know About Sex Come along with me to one of our classes on family life and sex education . This is the ninth grade . The class of twenty-four is evenly divided between boys and girls . Over the blackboard hangs a hand-lettered sign reading , " Sex is something we . are , not just something we do . " The students are sitting in a circle , talking ? selfconsciously . The teacher leading the discussion is a youngish , attractive woman who has ? en married ten years and has two children of her All . The young people are still buzzing as they file out , f the classroom . They have been talking freely . : bout things probably never discussed , openly or secretly , in their homes ? or anywhere else , except , possibly , in the corner booth at the local hangout or : n the protective darkness of a slumber party . But they hear about these things all the time in sex-laden films and books or innuendos shrieked at them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misinformation and destructive conditioning thus acquired is massive . So is the degree of fear and perverse curiosity that grows out of parental silence or self-consciousness about sex . We 're trying to do something about this problem in the junior and senior high schools of Anaheim , California , in what I believe is the most comprehensive public-school sex-education program ever undertaken in the United States . It started five years ago when a film we were showing in a lone , unsatisfactory ninth-grade sex-education class ? similar to those found today in many American high schools ? aroused an emotional protest from a small segment of our community because it included a factual discussion of masturbation . The protesters demanded that all sex education be dropped from our schools . We decided instead to turn this confrontation into an opportunity to explore community feelings often kept submerged in a public hassle of this kind . So , at the urging of the school board , a citizens ' advisory committee representing fourteen major organizations in Anaheim was formed to evaluate the need and desirability of sex education in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ninety percent of the residents of the community ( including eighty-four percent of the Catholics polled ) favored a greatly expanded program of sex education ? including both junior and senior .. high schools ? in Anaheim . Since 1964 we have been building such a program . There was no handy blueprint to follow ; we had to create one . Teachers volunteered from every department , and together we assembled what material was available and worked up a curriculum . The teachers elected Mrs. Sally Williams , an exceptional school nurse with a Master 's degree in health education and fifteen years ' experience , to supervise the program . Because children face different problems at different ages , we decided to start sex-education classes in the seventh grade , at about age twelve or thirteen ? when the need for straightforward information becomes acute ? and continue it through high school . An hour a day for five weeks was diverted from physical education for the family-life classes . A student could be excused from them on his own request or that of his parents . ( Fewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made such a request . ) I believe that the need for sex education in our public schools has grown out of the refusal of many American parents to deal realistically with this subject in the home ? and of the clergy to do so in the church . The results of this failure can be seen in almost every community in teenage pregnancies , a growing incidence of homosexuality and emotionally disturbed young people , and a breakdown in moral and ethical codes . Most youngsters have learned no other terminology for sexual matters than the dirty words acquired in the streets . They are unable to accept the idea that continued on page 170 103  | their parents enjoy sexual relations because sex has been put up to them a " dirty " ? and they do n't want to regal their parents as dirty . Thus , it 's impossible for these young people to tal about sex with simple , factual dignity . In Anaheim we were fortunate enough to have parents who realm tically recognized their own inability to deal with this problem . So they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child proud aware of his own sexuality and read to accept it with responsibility . We to relieve destructive emotions w helping our young people understate the feelings of the opposite sex . We ' do n't do it by lecturing the kids door matically ; this has been happening them for so long that they simply tunl out . We do it by letting them know that somebody is going to consider serious . ly their views and the problems that confront them without hiding behind the double standard of morality that adults usually apply to the adolescent world . @# What are the questions relating to sex and family life that really trouble young people ? questions that can , end probably should , be dealt with at home . but often are n't ? They differ radically at different ages and stages of development . But after four years of growing dialogue with young people in sexeducation classes , we in Anaheim have found that the following questions seem to appear most often , either in class discussion or anonymous written queries . ? Why do n't my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers to honest questions ? This is a frequent concern of seventh-graders . Adults perpetually think they are kidding their children when the young people are simply going along with the deception ? but wondering why they do n't get straight answers . We asked one group of seventh-graders what they had been told about the origin of babies , and received some incredible answers . A good many of these young people , on the verge of physical maturity , had never been given any information to supplant earlier stories that babies were found in the oven . under cabbage leaves or in the doctor 's  | bag . Practically none of them knew onest , adult words for the parts of leir bodies or bodily functions . Years of being scolded for showing a perfectly normal curiosity about the arts of their own bodies had induced 11 sorts of guilt feelings and a numbing self-consciousness . But worst of El , such treatment had also seriousT weakened the confidence of these oung people in the honesty of their parents ? at a time when it is absoluteessential to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous to go steady ? What is etting ? What is a French kiss ? Why oes a boy blow in a girl 's ear ? These kke some of the specific questions , having to do with dating behavior , that tenth-graders ask . There is also an avalanche of written anonymous questions seeking to un ; ramble sexual terminology . Words ' at students have heard whispered , or en scrawled on latrine walls , about hich they have been too embarrassed ask at home , are dumped into the hopper for explanation , Such words ' e then explained in the classroom , Lctually and without emotion . As a cult , dirty words are no longer mysrious ; thereby they lose much of their attraction . Once a sensible rap ) rt and a dignified nomenclature have been established , these young people in begin to acquire some knowledge about the physical growth and personality development of themselves id their classmates . By the time they reach the eighth grade , at thirteen or fourteen , many rung people have become tired of school and see little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitally important that Ley begin to develop some sort of ng-range personal philosophy that ill guide their development as well as left sexual behavior in the years lead . A good many more young people Ian you would care to imagine have ad some sort of sex experience by the ghth grade , but they have very little understanding of what happened to Lem or the social consequences of such activity . The mark of the eighth-grader is a kind of sophisticated naivete . Why is n't it all right to " make out " ith a boy if you are really in love ith each other ? eighth-grade girls ask . t this age , a girl is likely to believe ay older boy who tells her how much loves her , and she tends to see herself a partner in one of the world 's great ha ve affairs . She 's long on romance but lows virtually nothing about sexual arousal or the ground rules , already accepted by older boys , that throw virtually all of the responsibility on the girl to call a halt to heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . Is there something wrong with a boy ho is n't all excited about girls ? eighth-grade boys have been told by their older associates that a male must adept sexually in order to prove his asculinity . Many boys at this age have 3 such interest , and they are greatly relieved to be reassured that that does n't mean they 're abnormal . In the ninth and tenth grades , at fifteen and sixteen , the sexual temptations and opportunities become greater the desires stronger , and the questionmore anguished . Here , probably more than at any other age , it is importan : that young people ? and especially boy , ? understand the differences between masculinity and femininity . Boys are terribly fearful of feelings and urges they suspect may be homosexual . They have been told by society that tenderness , compassion , the love of good music or dance , and sensitivity are effeminate qualities . e What is a homosexual ? Am I effeminate because I. . . . Sensitive boys , or those who have a strong bond of affection with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred feelings that have been associated wrongly with nonmasculinity . After a tenth-grade class in which the teacher explained homosexuality and pointed out that homosexuals were not people to be ridiculed or tormented , a lanky , terribly uneasy boy asked to talk with the teacher . In private , he said he had been " playing around with his buddy " and did n't know what to think of it or do about it . Even though he was feeling uncomfortable , the buddy persisted . What should he do ? The teacher suggested he talk the problem over with his buddy and share the class discussion with him . Next day the boy was back to tell the teacher that his buddy had been uncomfortable and uncertain too , and was as relieved as he himself had been to have the matter brought out into the open . They remained friends , and the " playing around " stopped . ? Is a boy who masturbates a homosexual ? Will masturbation cause permanent mental or physical harm ? By ninth and tenth grade , almost all boys have indulged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a result . They badly need their fears dissipated . I recall one confused and frightened lad who wrote : " If you play with yourself and are not able to stop . what will it do and can it be stopped ? I have been doing this for a long time and I need help . " This is no isolated cry . The prevalent attitude toward masturbation ? among both boys and girls ? as some sort of social and moral disease , with frightening consequences , must be replaced with the factual information that it causes no physical harm and is psychologically destructive only to the degree that the practitioner is overcome with fear or guilt , or tends to turn in upon himself rather than learning to relate to other people . These are facts . and I 've seen no indication that knowing them has either encouraged or increased the practice . But the knowledge has relieved a great deal of destructive emotional distress . ? Why are boys generally more interested in sex than girls ? Why are girls more difficult to arouse ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and avidly than others ? Ninth-  | and tenth-grade girls are preoccupied with the growingly apparent differences between the sexuality of boys and girls . It is imperative at this age that girls understand the mechanics of sexual arousal that grow out of heavy petting . They must know that there is a point beyond which it is almost impossible to stop , and they must realize that responsibility for preventing things from getting that far rests almost entirely ? justly or unjustly ? with the girl . ? What happens during pregnancy ? What is labor and how long does it last ? How is the baby able to make its way out of the mother 's body ? Many seniors will be marrying and raising their own families in a year or two . Hence the girls are deeply interested in child care and the mechanics of childbirth . Both boys and girls , by ages sixteen to eighteen , also want detailed information about methods of contraception and child planning . We do n't offer a sequence on birth control in our classroom . We consider that to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are ready to get married . But you can be sure that by the time your sons and daughters are ready to graduate from high school , they are seeking specific information about the means and efficacy of various methods of contraception . And there is always the danger that they will get the wrong information if their questions are not answered as completely and as factually as possible at home . ? Is there anything wrong with premarital sex ? During the final two years of high school , this question is asked more than any other . The connotation is n't always moral or ethical . Almost as often , it is simply practical ? Will premarital sex help or hinder me in getting a husband ( or wife ) ? This is n't a question that can be met with handwringing or outraged lectures . It quite simply is what the kids are thinking , and if they are to be deterred from experimentation they must be provided with factual information that will make deterrence rational to them . It is a sad fact that practically none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the role of organized religion in providing them with a standard of sexual ethics or morality . Almost universally , they see no relevance between church training and the world in which they live and make daily decisions . How many times I have heard teenagers say , " I go to church because my parents want me to go and for no other reason . " It is n't our job at school to provide a moral ethic . But we can make our young people aware of the dangers and social consequences of premarital sex . They must understand that boys still want virgins for wives . Girls who give themselves before marriage are materially reducing their own chances . Admittedly the male is often a contradictory creature . He may be predatory with every girl he dates , but he still wants to marry a virgin . In the classroom , these ideas can be explored , and @# the two sexes then can face up to then : In the process , we 've had some surprises . We 've found , for example , tha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in premarital chastity for themselves . These are usually boys who have a good deal of self-confidence and some idea where they are going . We 've also discovered that most young people have a dim opinion of promiscuity Girls , particularly , have little interest in sex for its own sake ; they need to regard sexual experience strictly as a manifestation of undying love . We let it be known through the student grapevine last year that we wanted to make an anonymous tape of girls who had had sexual experiences so that others might profit from their mistakes . The response was breathtakin. even to us . Many of the respondents were the so-called " good girls , " eager to tell others that the experience had destroyed their own sense of selfworth . Most of them said they did n't know how it happened , that they did n't realize until too late they had reached the point where the intellect no longer functioned . This tape will be played in our classrooms next year . It will be effective because high-school juniors and seniors are constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our women teachers received a written question recently , asking i ; she had participated in premarital sex . She astounded the class by reading the question . Then she told them , " I 'm not going to give you a direct answer , because it 's none of your business . I would n't ask you this and you have no right to ask me . " She did n't stop there , however . She went on to ask the class to ponder the reasons for the question , and she drew from class discussion the conclusion that it was asked because somebody was looking for justification of his or her own behavior . " I 'm not going to make it that easy for you , " she told them . This is the battlement we must defend constantly with eleventh- and twelfth-graders : the dependence on some sort of popular mandate to make , their decisions , even their moral judgments , for them . Constantly they want to know : Is it right or wrong ? And they are perfectly willing to accept group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They love surveys when the results justify their own actions . We avoid polls for just that reason . The essence of our program is to force each youngster to make a rational decision on his own , rather than just sliding into a line of behavior . Fear no longer seems to work as a very effective deterrent to premarital sex . Religion also appears to have abandoned the field . In this void , we are trying to make our young people think through exactly what sexual re-. lations signify ? in social consequences . in personal self-depreciation and in the very practical task of finding a mate . We have been accused of teaching mid-@#  | dle-class morality , and perhaps we are . But we 're doing it by involving the youngster instead of simply giving him abstract information . At the same time , we are constantly seeking ways to improve our program . We badly need more opportunity for counseling . As we gain the confidence of the young people , they come to us increasingly with problems we have neither the staff nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake parents profoundly . In one recent week , for example , we had a frightened girl whose boy friend had threatened suicide if she broke off with him . . . a junior boy who thinks he has VD and wo n't go to his parents or his family doctor . . . a girl who thinks she is pregnant from the attentions of a friend of the family who came to visit while her parents were out . These are not exotic cases . We cope with similar problems every week . And we feel strongly that many of them could have been prevented by a wholesome , factual , aboveboard program of sex education at home or school or both . Troubled parents often ask me what they can do to increase communication in the home and , specifically , what they should tell their children about sex . I do n't have ten handy rules to offer , because every family and every individual is different , and I distrust generalities in this area as much as in any other . I can , however , offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should very early use correct nomenclature so they can talk to their children about men and women in simple , realistic and unembarrassed terms . Parents should recognize a natural curiosity among children about their bodies , and not make them self-conscious because they want to satisfy that curiosity . Sexuality should be discussed casually , without emotion and in precise terms . Children instinctively hold off from their parents in this area , and a devious or disapproving approach to sexuality makes it easier for them to withdraw further . From the beginning , children should also be taught to be glad they are what they are ? male or female ? and to understand and appreciate the human body . The most enlightened home probably is n't going to prevent sexual embarrassment totally . Outside the home children are immediately hit by the shame and furtiveness of others . It is so deep in our society that it will take generations to dig out . But your children should understand that some of their friends will have an unnatural curiosity about sex because they have been told nothing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sexual deviation is quite simply the product of parental fears . To remove those fears , we are now offering a nine-week night-school course for adults in which we pull together the key ideas offered to their children in the six-year sex-education program . Already three-hundred parents have taken the course , and the demand is growing . These parents have accepted the changes in social conditions and beliefs that make it urgent for them to communicate with their children on sexuality . They recognize that child-rearing needs an overhaul , that kids want reasons instead of arbitrary commands , and that they will talk to parents if they can get factual answers and are n't prejudged . Is our sex-education program working ? We 'd like , honestly , to know ourselves . We 'd like to see it evaluated ? by testing the attitudes and behavior of children and parents before and after ? but we lack both the money and qualified people to do it . We know only what the young people and their parents choose to tell us , and so far this has generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , " We 're discussing these things openly for the first time at home since our children have taken your familylife course . " A few weeks ago , a mother came to a high-school open house , embraced the woman who taught her child 's eleventh-grade sex-education class , and wept as she told her , " For the first time in years , my daughter has accepted my counsel , and your class made it possible . " @# Outsiders insist on trying to make this program controversial , when it is nothing of the kind . One of our twelfth-grade boys recently told a visitor , " We always hear the complain ! that the more we know , the more we try it out . That 's bunk ! Actually it works just the other way . Now that we know what 's happening , we do n't have to experiment to find out . " I like to think that our program was at least partly responsible for the views on marriage written recently by a senior girl in response to a classroom question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage , I want my husband and I to be best friends . I want to be a wife he can talk to , gripe at , lean on , grow and learn with and love . I intend to have a relationship that is close and warm with lots of open space to grow closer and warmer . I intend to be the woman who will make my husband be the man . I do n't expect lovely times and fireworks all the time . That is n't life . I believe both partners should give ninety percent each and expect hack ten percent . Who can lose ? " Who , indeed ? YOU SURE MAKE GRAPE JELLY ! Josephine 's Household ?
