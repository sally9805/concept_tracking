txt GETTYSBURG , Pa. , Oct. ** his seventy-first birthday today Dwight D. Eisenhower was hard at work on the one big job he could never quite bring off as President '  - -  the remaking of the Republican party in his own image . When he talks with friends about his goals it is never in those terms . But since he speaks with the greatest authority ' as the leader of his party and is convinced that its only future is in the " responsible progressive " brand of Republicanism for which he stands , it amounts to the same thing . Actually , General Eisenhower does not define his inescapable task nor say what he is doing . He just does it . It is from his ' voluminous correspondence , his steady stream of visitors and his occasional public appearances that the picture emerges . What it , adds up to is scraping the barnacles off the party organization and destroying the Ipopular impression that Republican is synonymous with wealth and big business . In a Fighting Mood A man twenty years his junior came away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He may be beating his head against a stone wall but that wall is going to take an awful beating . " He went on to explain that he never had seen General Eisenhower in such a fighting mood . " He seems to take the Democratic victory last year as a personal defeat , " he added . The estimate was a little wide of the mark . It is what has happened since the election that determined General Eisenhower on his present course . After denouncing the spending policy of the Kennedy Administration as " spendthrift if not downright profligate , " he put it to an old friend and political ally this way : " What else can I do ? I put a stop to the New Deal-Fair Deal spending spree only to see the same mania come back just as strong under this present bunch . ! I have no choice but to try to ! stop it again . To do otherwise would be a dereliction of duty ? b7ause the way we 're headed // An Aroused Eisenhower Is Seeking Revitalize HE ACTS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Responsible Progressivism Is Best Future Course // now can only mean a price inflation or much higher taxes or both by 1965 . " Thus , after nine months as a private citizen General Eisenhower has turned his back on the retired life of a country squire . He knows now that the quiet life of a gentleman farmer was not for him , anyway . Feelings on Proper Role He feels too deeply about the proper role of the Federal Government in the American scheme of things to count his cattle while his convictions about fiscal responsibility , individual self-reliance and community effort are frustrated by Washington 's bureaucracy . For all its apparent indecision on foreign policy questions , General Eisenhower has not had much to say in criticism of the Administration in that field . Some with whom he has talked think this may be because he does not want to weaken the President 's hand in these critical times . The Cuban invasion was a stupid blunder , General Eisenhower believes . Much worse , as he sees it , was the effort to cover the Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manned flight to the moon and sending 1,500 troops to West Berlin . For the former President can think of no other explanation for those two moves . He remarked to an old friend of his Army days : " Khrushchev must have had a good laugh over the troops thing when he told John . McCloy , ' does n't he know I can put in ten divisions for every one he can send to Germany . " ' The thing that genuinely concerns General Eisenhower as much as " the character of the Administration " is what he calls President Kennedy 's attempt to conduct the Presidency as a one-man show , without any coordinated staff effort , or fixed meetings of the Cabinet and the National Security Council . He believes the Cuban fiasco would not have happened if the invasion plans had been reviewed by the council . Benefit of Best Minds As he sees it , any problem worthy of the President 's attention should have the benefit of the combined wisdom of the best minds having knowledge of that problem within the Federal establishment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man knowing most about the problem will not even be asked about it . And once a decision has been translated into action it is already too late to call it back . As a military man he will never understand how the intended air cover for the Cuban invasion could be grounded thirty minutes before take-off and as the second striking force was nearing the Bay of Pigs . Even a cadet would know that once forces have been committed the entire plan of campaign must be carried out  --  not just part of it . As for putting a man on the moon at a cost of $40,000,000 , - 000 what rankles General Eisenhower is not so much the " stunt " aspect of the project but what he considers to be the basic motivation of this and other costly spending programs . He believes they all stem from a desire of the Kennedy Adminlistration to perpetuate itself in office . To him , the underlying motivation is about as subtle as , Harry Hopkins ' New Deal for-1 mule of " spend and spend ; tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he believes it is basically immoral thus to mortgage , the living standards if not the security of future generations , General Eisenhower has decided to fight . That is why he will be go-1 ing up and down the land in the coming months asking Rea publicans to forget about rumor differences between their Catoe didates and to concentrate on the big differences between the , " dedicated , responsible and sett-1 less Government " he tried to bring to Washington and what he thinks they are getting now . It explains why he will spend Tuesday campaigning wile James P. Mitchell , his former Labor Secretary and now the Republican candidate for Governor of New Jersey . It is the reason he will be talking about responsible government in six speeches in New York during the week to follow . The zeal with which General Eisenhower is going about his new task has astonished even his immediate staff . He laughed out loud when a political columnist speculated that he was so bored with what he was doing that he might run for the United States Senate from Pennsylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman 's club , " he . asked dryly , " when I have a ready-made platform from which to do the one thing I know I must do ! " His enthusiasm for his work was evident as he put the finishing touches on his warning to Pennsylvania Republicans this week to " pay no attention to self-labeled conservatives and liberals  --  terms not understood by anyone including those who use them . " The important thing he wants people to remember is that " we can not embrace the extremes of either the Right or the Left because to do so is the path to political ruin . " Personal Consequences In mapping his campaign for " responsible progressivism , " General Eisenhower has taken no account of any personal consequences or its reception by any reactionary elements in his party . It is enough that he sees clearly what he must do . But a lifelong habit of thought ' and some ten years of direct dealings with Republican professionals are no small help in the undertaking . If they find him sometimes bordering on the heretical they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he is already preaching that " we will win next year and in 1964 , not because we are Republicans , but because we stand for the things that are right for America . " He has not forgotten that the professionals talked ' him out of his intended defense of the late General of the Army George C. Marshall in the 1952 campaign because it would hurt the election chances of General Marshall 's detractor , the late Senator Joseph R. McCarthy , who was appearing with General Eisenhower on the same plat- ' form . Doing His Utmost And as he has had occasion to recall more than once since leaving the White House , his overwhelming victory at the polls in 1952 and 1956 was not because of his acceptability to the party professionals . In the earlier election particularly , he won " because I had a pretty well known name as the boss of a hell of a lot of troops who thought I was a good guy . " And it will be as a " good guy " who stands for something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his utmost to upset the Democratic party in the months ahead . He knows the professionals will be with him because they can not do without him . But he also knows that he will need the organization of professionals if his effort is to get anywhere . And that is where a lifelong habit el thought comes into the picture . Gettysburg is a small town with all of the small town curiosity about its first - citizen 's philosophy of life and " secret of success . " After a dinner of the town 's , service organization representatives recently , General Eisenhower was asked what a young man could do to get ahead in his chosen line of endeavor . " Use his common sense and any other talents he was born with and leave the rest to providence , " was his reply . Common sense tells General Eisenhower he must speak up for the principles in which he believes . He also thinks that much of the success that came to him was " accidental . " He believes to this day that except for the instinctive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never have been President . This belief can be documented with a story known only to a few . Had Been Approached General Eisenhower already had been approached about the Republican Presidential ' nomination when in 1950 he agreed to return to Europe as commander of North Atlantic Treaty forces , Looking back on it , he recalls that it was not easy to give up the presidency of Columbia University . But , I believing- that the . future of Western , Europe depended on its military alliance with the United States , ? he was willing to give up anything to further that project . He was convinced also ' that the alliance could not succeed - without continuing bipartisan support in the United ; States Senate . With that in ; mind he sought out Senator Tina asking him to make a public statement of his support of the principle of collective security in the Atlantic community . At the same time , General Eisenhower prepared a state- , ment forswearing the Presi-1 dential nomination that his aides still say Would make Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman 's famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , General Eisenhower believed , could he put - beyond doubt hisl sincere- conviction that Only , through the , alliance would Western Europehe made secure . i After some discussion of the number of troop divisions involved , Senator Taft said he was sorry but that he could not pledge the project his support . The refusal caused General Eisenhower to destroy his intended statement , which irrevocably withdrew hit name from consideration as a candidate for the nomination . Thought to Heep Grip Although no politician , his instincts told brim that without the pledged support of Senator Taft he had better keep a firm grip on whatever leverage his availability might ' give him for NATO purposes at home and abroad . But , according to the few with whom he has shared the story , he remains certain in his own mind that once his carefully worded statement had ' been published , he could not have accepted the Republican nomination . Strange as the Story may seem , it is entirely , in keeping with General Eisenhower 's views about , running for elective political ' office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publisher a year or two before that he could not even consider running for the Presidency . General Eisenhower 's thinking at the time was that he had reached the pinnacle of success with the triumph of the Western Allies over Germany in World War II . He felt that , thereafter , anything else including the Presidency would have been anticlimax and somehow going down hill . How he came to change his mind is another story , but it had nothing to do with the strategy of being hard to get . Because his memory of events before and immediately after his first nomination remains keen he is warning potential candidates to beware of getting themselves labeled as liberal or conservative , and warning the voters to pay no attention to those ' who call themselves one or the other . Surprised by Taft He recalls discovering to his great surprise that " Mr. Conservative , " as Senator Taft was often described , was far to the left of him on such questions as public housing and Federal aid to education among others . When he asked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taft replied : " That 's just of those things the newspapers pin on you and that you just have to learn to live with . " Governor Rockefeller is another case in point . General Eisenhower never doubted that the New Yorker 's position was so close to his own on most public issues that the difference was not worth talking about . As he sees it Mr. Rockefeller had to take a position that would appear different from that of former Vice President Richard M. Nixon to retain his separate identity as a candidate . And in trying to avoid a position to the President 's right , Mr. Rockefeller ended up with an appearance of being too far to the President 's left . Whatever the differences appeared to be then between the Governor end the President , General Eisenhower thinks his views and those of Mr. Rockefeller now generally coincide . Since the President did want to see Mr. Nixon nominated and elected to succeed him , he probably will be excused for not correcting a distorted public image of the Governor at the time . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons . Not the least of these was his ' belief ' that ' the forfner Vice President would attract so many young ' voters among the independents as to make his election a certainty . And when the younger voters went the other way , his disappointment was nearly as great as the Republican defeat itself . ' Big Disappointment He thinks ? the Work of the Young Republican Clubs and the Citizens Committees for , Eisenhower were largely responsible for , his , great , plurality in 1952 . Through most of his first Administration ha tried to persuade the national:commits tee to bring more younger - people into the permanent party organization . It remains one of his few ' big disappointments that the effort did narsucceed " I worked like a ' dog-to bring that about , ' he told a recent visitor to his little . office on the Gettysburg College campus . " But if I had , it to do all ; over again I would work a lot harder at it . " Some have come- away front the converted residence at 300 Carlisle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now the most likely candidate for . the Republican nomination in 1964 it would , be Governor ' Rockefeller . But he is not apt to say so ? not publicly at least ? so long as there remains a possibility of a Nixon draft movement at the nominating convention . He does not consider ; that Mr. Nixon 's statement in announcing for the Republican nomination for . Governor of California bars him from the party 's Presidential nomination ? not by any means . But he would agree that Mr. Nixon can not mow actively seek the nomination by filing , as a candidate in the state primaries . Doubts-A Deadlcok On the other hand , General Eisenhower appears to disagree with those who like to think of a convention deadlock between the forces of Governor Rockefeller and Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona . It probably would come as a surprise to hint if the , Senator is a serious contender for the nomination by convention time for all his demonstrated ability to arouse the spirits of his , partisan audiences . If he really is less than enthusiastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not saying why . For one thing , he seems convinced that this is not the time to discuss the merits of potential candidates . Instead , he will be asking his audiences to ? " support and fight for the ' ideals ; principles and fundamentals an which we as citizens can generally agree rather than expending so mud : effort debating the petty details on which we may have differing opinions . " Meanwhile , he finds comfort in the realization ? that " some 34,000,000 people supported our cause a year ago and I am coavinced that far more will do so next year and in 1964.
