That bedeviled man , Japan 's Premier Nobusuke Kishi , did not even get the privilege of quitting office gracefully last week . Victimized politically for putting through the Japanese-U.S . Security Treaty by the fanatics of the left , he suffered a final personal indignity at the hands of a fanatic of the right , who knifed him in the thigh . <P> Box of Cake . Even the choice of his successor brought untidy dispute . From all over Japan , Liberal Democratic delegates convened in Tokyo to pick a new party president , who would automatically become the party 's nominee for Premier . Kishi 's choice was Trade Minister Hayato Ikeda . But ability or ideology had little to do with the battle . As is their custom , big Japanese business firms , hoping for future friendly treatment in such matters as import licenses , taxes and government contracts , backed one or another of the eight party factions to the tune of $4,000,000 . By common consent , it was the most corrupt convention in the party 's short history . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> His air ticket to Tokyo had been bought by the Ikeda faction . But before he could board the plane , he was approached by a forceful hakoshi , or delegate rustler , from a rival faction , who persuaded him to swap his air ticket for a first-class train ride , " all meals paid for , and plenty of sake . " But once aboard the train , the delegate fell in with a smooth-talking hakoshi of the Fujiyama faction , who persuaded him to descend for a night of pleasure in the resort town of Atami , 60 miles short of Tokyo . Before resuming the journey next day . the delegate was presented with a cakebox , and the modest explanation : " It 's only a little ochugen ' ( a traditional midyear gift ) . The cakebox was stuffed with crisp 10,000-yen ( about $28 ) notes . <P> At Tokyo Station , the delegate was snatched from the Fujiyama hakoshi by burly Ikeda hakoshi , who bundled him into a waiting car and drove him to a plush , Western-style hotel ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There a double room with bath awaited him and , on a bedside table , another cake-box stuffed with yen . Under guard until convention time , the delegate was at last safely counted as kanzume ( in the can ) for Candidate Ikeda . <P> Flocking in Cadillacs to the convention hall , the candidates bargained furiously to put together a stop-Ikeda ticket . But Ikeda was backed by two banks , a shipbuilder , the Nomura Securities Co. and much of the old Mitsui industrial combine , as well as by Premier Kishi . One rival , Party Vice President Bamboku Ohno , wailed : " I have locked up in a safe Kishi 's written promise to make me Japan 's next Premier . " . Maybe he did . But Kishi stuck with Ikeda . At the last minute . Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama tossed Ikeda a block of 49 votes that had cost a reported $280,000 , and Ikeda rolled on to win the party presidency on the second ballot with 302 out of 496 votes . Within minutes a crowd of 30,000 leftists formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Down with Ikeda ! "
