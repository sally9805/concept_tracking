txt For the first time in the 20th century , a new form of natural fuel has been discovered in this country . It is natural gas  --  and it could well provide a much  --  needed boost to the British economy . Some observers believe it could have as far reaching effects as coal had in the 19th century . Britain may have at least 50 percent of its required gas resources on its own doorstep . The recent Shell-Esso group find of natural gas in the North Sea confirms the highest hopes raised by the first strike last December , made by British Petroleum ( BP ) . Helpful to industries Natural gas can be put to many uses in the home and in industry . If the latest find holds a high methane content , a fact known only to the Shell-Esso group 's laboratories , then it will provide an extremely clean source of power . This will be of particular importance to such industries as food , ceramics , and glass . New Minister of Power , Richard Marsh . has been handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market . Touchy questions face him : ? How does one deal with the coal and fuel-oil industry chiefs , who may see this discovery as a threat in the coming years ? ? How does one protect coal , of which there is still more than enough for Britain 's needs ? ? Should the government enough price to discourage natural gas in order to keep fuel as in Holland ? ? If natural gas is made a cheap fuel , what will happen to the electricity industry ? in particular , nuclear power ? The government has sunk vast sums into this field . Steps have to be taken at once to make natural gas available . A complete network of pipes has to be laid to transport it . The Gas Council already is operating a pipe system for imported methane gas from the Sahara arriving at Canvey Island in the mouth of the Thames . But this network , even with future development , will not be sufficient to handle the vast quantities expected to come from the North Sea . The minister will have to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? wide service . In Holland the cost of constructing a i3O00. kilometer network of 24-inch pipe is about ? 80 million ( $224 million ) . Conversion needed In addition to that cost , existing pipes will have to be refurbished . Houses and appliances also will have to he converted since natural gas has about twice the heat content of other gas . The cost of these conversions at present runs to ? 30 ( $84 ) per house on Canvey Island . When the gas is flowing  --  BP and ShellEsso say the pipes to the rigs will be laid by 1967 ? it will probably be introduced into the economy in stages . First to use the supply will be industry . The auto industry would benefit greatly , following this winter 's cut in gas supplies after mechanical failures at gas plants in the Midlands . The flame burning over the Shell  --  Esso rig Neptune I brings a bright new light to the industry of Britain . It also shows that Brit . ain 's future needs for power are coming closer to home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
