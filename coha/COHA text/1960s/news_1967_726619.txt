txt Mayor Heinrich Albertz of West Berlin and his city government resigned today as a result of a smoldering domestic crisis and Increasing strife within the Social . Democratic party , Under the Berlin Constibi- ' Lion , Mr. Albertz will head a caretaker government until the Social Democrats , who hold the majority in the city Assembly , agree on a new candidate . The Berlin Social Democrats announced that they planned to hold a special party convention next week to pick a new Mayor . With no prospective local candidate in sight , party leaders were considering offering the job to West German Socialist politicians . Charges on Student Riots The immediate cause for Mr. Albertz 's resignation was his inability to name a Minister of the Interior in his city administration after the party board turned down several candidates he proposed during the day . Mr. Albert ; took this as an indirect ' vote of no confidence from his own party . The 51-year-old Mayor fought in vain against mounting charges that he had failed to deal successfully with student riots that erupted June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Iran . A university student was shot and killed by a detective during the riots . Mr. Albertz took the top administrative post in Berlin in December , when his Socialist predecessor , Willy Brandt , joined West Germany 's coati // tion Government as Vice Chan- , cellor and Foreign Minister . The three Western Allies ? ' Britain , France and the United States ? have held supreme power in West Berlin since the end of World War II . For years , however , they have refrained ' from directly influencing the civil administration . Allied of ficials said they regretted the government crisis and expressed hope for an early settlement . Failure Conceded Looking tense and drawn , Mr. Albertz said in a brief statement that he was resigning " in the interest of Berlin and its citizens " because he had failed in his attempts to maintain a working city government . Though West Berlin is not a full-fledged part of the West German Federal Republic , the position of the city 's Mayor roughly corresponds to that of the Premier of a West German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's failure to actively seek control of the Berlin Social Democrats after he took office . After Mr. Brandt left for Bonn , the local party machine split into two factions , neither of which proved ready to throw its full weight behind the Mayor . The domestic crisis , while sparked by the student riots , was said to have been caused by a growing frustration over a gradual erosion . of West Berlin 's political and economic position . Talks With East Urged On Sunday the Social Democrats recommended that the city government open direct negotiations with East Germany on matters affecting both parts of Berlin , such as passes for West Berliners to visit the East and the resumption of telephone communications in the city . They overruled a rightwing faction in the party and the minority Christian Democrats , who oppose any opening toward the East now . The opponents of negotiations feared that the Communists would put pressure on the city to loosen its ties with the West and to force agreement on some form of neutralization of West Berlin . Left-wing students and other minority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the riots in June advocate a neutral Berlin . They contend that such a status would strengthen the city . West Berlin has had a constant drain of brains and skilled labor to West Germany since the Communists built their wall six years ago . Twenty per cent of its population is now at least 60 years old . The Albertz government argued that an intensification of trade ties with East Germany and other Eastern European countries could help stimulate the city 's economy . However , industrial leaders here and in the Federal Republic remained skeptical , maintaining that Berlin could exist only by strengthening its economic and financial links with West Germany .
