74 MAN WITH A PAIN his left forearm and elbow were badly scraped but that along his waist and hip the skin was not even broken and there he would have only a long nasty-looking bruise . ? That night he dreamt that he was walking downtown , near the college . It was winter and twilight , again , but the sidewalks were crowded with pedestrians , and the streets full of cars and bicycles . He was mortally injured , his entire left side was open . But it was n't pain he felt . It was terror , and the feeling of imbalance , of draining away . He could n't understand how people could pass without commenting on the gush of blood , the entrails hanging down his thigh . He pressed his hands to his side and walked rapidly up and down the streets , entreating passers-by with his face ( for he dared not take his hands from his side ) but not speaking . He was looking for a doctor . But at times it seemed to him that all he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he did because when night came he would die . Or was it just that he wanted to stay out on the street as long as he could , because he knew that he was to die at home ? 3 . The pain is the medium of his life . At first he fell to the bottom , he lay like sediment in the depths of the glass , dazed , shattered , looking upward through the thick but light-pierced liquid . Then he began to rise slowly , but only to dissolve and be distributed everywhere throughout the medium . Now he has recrystallized and floats uneasily , wearily on the surface . He is glad that everyone has heard . Then he does n't have to explain . Thursday morning he says : This is the day , there will be some change , some alteration . And if I do n't feet the difference by the end of the day , it will be because today a letter was mailed but I have not yet received it , a decision was made but I could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was in the bathroom taking a shower and the caller will call again . He thinks of renting another apartment , in another part of the city . He steps on a tack , and feels his foot has betrayed him . At the office , while dictating some letters to his secretary , he is repelled by the harshness in his voice . He waits all afternoon to speak to his boss , to tell him that he 's going to take another week off , but his boss does n't return from lunch that day . His wound has begun to stink . Most of his friends avoid him . He tries to imagine that he caused the pain , that he wanted it . That comforts him , makes him momentarily cheerful . But when he feels the pain ebbing a little , and leaving a void behind , he 's frightened and summons it back . He understands his suffering as a sign of vigor , and his vigor as a sign of suffering . On Monday the pain is better . He is not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's a space between himself and it . His life is full of things . They are his conscience . He does not neglect Mrs. Voltaire . He knows he will be recovering when he can go to the movies . Right now he ca n't bear the idea of sitting in a movie theatre . He ca n't bear the idea of hearing about , or being asked to share in , the fortunes of anyone else . Elizabeth calls to tell him not to worry . Sometimes his screams are so discreet he wonders if he 's suffering at all , Then the phone rings , and his heart butts against his ribs like a caged bull and fever soars to his face . It is only Stanley , asking him to a party , and he yells at him and says he would n't dream of going to his goddam party . An hour later he calls Stanley back and accepts the invitation . He does not understand more than his life expresses . During his lunch hour he sits on a bench in the park behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprawl , the children of weary lady shoppers play tag , faggots cruise , garment-factory girls pass arm in arm talking of love and TV in Spanish . He pretends he is waiting for someone . He is feeling better , stronger that day . He calls up his cousin in Brooklyn and invites himself there to dinner . But coming home , during the long subway ride , he begins to cry . 4 . There conies a time when he can not suffer any more . He has eaten his pain and slept in it and papered his walls with it and jammed it into the morning paper , alongside earthquakes and broken peace conferences . He is so tightly wrapped , swathed , and buttoned into his pain . He is embalmed in it , like a mummy . A tight cylinder of pain , he rolls down the hill into a vale of numbness . Saturday morning he simply does not get out of bed . The sheets of the oversize double bed have n't been changed in eleven days , and have a worn , mild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bed , waiting for the phone to ring . Like all sufferers enthralled by their injury , he a story by Susan Sontag 75 has never given up the hope of reprieve . This is his great error , now corrected . The nature of such pain is that it keeps coming until you give yourself over to it entirely , until you no longer seek to escape it , or outlive it . " Good God , man ! Stop groveling , sniveling , lying in the dust , tearing your clothes , mouthing ashes , sharpening your cheekbones ! The weekend is n't a sewer , you know . Change your sheets , but do n't return to that bed for eighteen hours . Shower , shave , put on clean clothes . . . " This is the voice of reason . Hearty , tiresome , right . An apple pie , whiskey and soda voice wearing good hairy tweeds . It sits across from the disheveled bed on a com- fortable chair . A friend , a comforter . Malcolm , the joker ? No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too cruel . Sunday afternoon . Get up ? Out into the city , like a timid child sent out to play or a gawking tourist from Ohio , he who had lived in Manhattan all his life . What shall it be ? The Staten Island ferry , Central Park , the Frick Collection , He thinks he can survive tame , civil amusements and diversions overrun with people . Call Elizabeth ? No . Try to do without . Try to take these first steps alone . If I ca n't manage , he thinks , I can always call her then . Someone accosts him on the ferry . " You look terrible , sir . " He is indignant at first , and then he laughs . This laughter becomes a palpable thing to him , it congeals , it solidifies , like a spar of wood thrown out to a man sinking in quicksand . Then he realizes that no one has spoken to him , that he has been gazing into a mirror in the men 's room . But he does n't scorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of order is order enough , he thinks ; any place where I can take hold is as good as any other . Back on the deck , he buys some peanuts and then settles on a bench along the railing . He yawns . His mother told him that when he or any of his five brothers and sisters were ill , sheknew they were recovering when she saw them yawn . The sun is shining ; there is a breeze ; the lower end of Manhattan , receding across the water , looks like the prow of a giant ship . He feels he is floating , too . It 's quiet , calm . Something has snapped today : the backbone of his longing . Which is it  --  madness or sanity ? ? to conclude , as he does now : Why , I 'm just like everyone else ! I 'm alone . I 'm unhappy . I 'm unloved by the one I loved . Whatever made me think my lot would be different ? He no longer feels much pain . Mostly he feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His injury is incontrovertible . But the pain of it is dying . The pain , not he . He is his own survivor , and at the end of the return trip on the ferry he greets the stone fortresses of the city with a soiled hardness equal to their own . Britain 's New State of Mind John by Mander After drowsing for fifteen years in smug self-satisfaction , the English are finally waking up to their true role in an unfamiliar world  --  and are getting ready to make some draAtic changes . is Britain finished ? Ts Britain decadent , corrupt , exhausted , a second-rate country ? Books , magazine articles , radio and television programs ; they 've all been saying it , obsessively , for the past year or so . Foreigners , too , have been saying it for quite a time . But the British ? until now  --  have never taken much account of what foreigners say . Until quite recently , a British equivalent of " The Ugly American " * wnuld have been unimaginable . Ugly Britons there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn , anyway , what the natives thought ? Traditionally , the British were not at all like Americans ; they did not expect to be loved . They even rather relished the myth of the Thin Red Line  --  that handful of stalwart fellows protecting white women and children from black and yellow hordes . But now , the British are not so sure . The merest tribute to British justice , British decency , British parliamentary democ- *In the novel of that name by Burdick and Lederer , " The Ugly American " was the hero , not the villain . But the term seems to have passed into the common language with a connotation exactly the opposite of its original meaning  --  as Mr. Mander here illustrates. ? The Editorsracy , from the blackest of black potentates , is received with obsequious gratitude . Just when Americans are growing a little less thin-skinned about what the natives say ( and high time , too ) , the British are beginning to want to be loved . Nowadays , the British are actually listening to what other people say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other people are saying that Britain is finished . Well , is she ? The first point to remember is that other people have been saying just this for thirty , fifty , even seventy years . Twenty-five years ago , the Nazis were convinced that Britain was finished ( so , incidentally , was U. S. Ambassador Joseph Kennedy ) . Fifty years ago , the Kaiser was calling Britain 's Expeditionary Force in France " a contemptible little army . " Germany was one of the new , rising nations ; Britain was old and enfeebled . And seventy years ago , when Britain was still without question the strongest nation in the world , there was already talk of Britain 's slowing rate of industrial expansion , her old-fashioned technology , her neglect of scientific education , her complacency and stagnation . Are the charges familiar ? They are indeed . For they are the charges British intellectuals bring against the twelve long , stagnant , and complacent years of Conservative government in this country . They are echoed in every speech of Harold Wilson . the Labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Conservatives themselves in their new drive to present Conservatism as the party of modernize-77 tion . What began as a debate among intellectuals ? in books like Michael Shanks 's The Stagnant Society , Anthony Hartley 's A State of England , Encounter magazine 's Suicide of a Nation , or in my own Great Britain or Little England ? ? has become a national political issue . Indeed , it is already likely that it will be the chief issue in the coming general election . To Americans , of course , this mood of national self-questioning is not unfamiliar . What is happening in Britain at present is not unlike what happened in America between the launching of the first Sputnik and President Kennedy 's election . For now in Britain it looks as if the party which can present its leader as the man to get the country moving will win the election . But the comparison does not extend very far . The loss of American confidence after the Sputnik was a transitory affair ; and there was very little basis , as we now know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic or military power . In Britain the malaise goes much deeper , and has a respectable history behind it . Thus , the dire predictions of commentators in the 1880s that Britain , if she did not take steps to improve her industrial competitiveness , would soon be overtaken by Germany and the United States , were perfectly justified . Most British people think of the " German miracle , " which has put Germany ahead of Britain in exports , as something that happened after 1945 . But German steel production surpassed that of Britain for the first time as long ago as 1900 . Similarly , by the end of the last century , America was already a more powerful industrial nation than Britain , and advancing with giant strides . Britain 's predicament , then , is not really new , It is the predicament of the nation that , having pioneered the industrial revolution , was first to discover that there are disadvantages in being first . For obsolescence is the price the country pays that rests on its laurels . Success induces complacency ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Britain has been paying , during these past seventy years , the price of her headlong advance in the first century of industrialization . Nor does the comparison with America reach John ' hander , London-born and Cambridge-educated , lived for four years in Germany and traveled in Eastern Europe and India . He has written several books , the most recent of which is " Great Britain or Little England ? " ( published here by Houghton Mifflin ) . He is now assistant editor of " Encounter " magazine in London . very far in the field of external relations . America 's problems have been those of a country whose expanding power brings with it expanding , and at first unwelcome , responsibilities . Under a succession of great Presidents  --  Wilson , the two Roosevelts , Truman , and Kennedy  --  these problems were confronted and resolved . Britain 's problems were very different . At the height of her power , in the mid-nineteenth century , Britain acquired vast responsibilities in the world  --  responsibilities not at all unlike those the U.

Between the two wars , Britain 's weakened posture was concealed ; Russia and Germany were still weak , the anti-colonial movement ( except in Ireland ) still lacked momentum . But by 1942 the true state of affairs had become painfully clear . In Europe , Britain was still free ; but she could not hope to defeat Germany without American and Russian assistance . In the East , Singapore and Burma had been lost , and India and Australia lay open to attack . It was only American power in the Pacific that held Japan in check . It became evident ( though many Britons are still unaware of it ) that the British Empire rested in the last analysis on American power . All that has happened since  --  the postwar devolution of responsibility to free Commonwealth states , first in Asia , then in Africa  --  was implicit in that traumatic wartime revelation that Britain 's responsibilities had indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens to a nation that is confronted so brutally with the fact of its relative decline ? ( One should emphasize that the decline is relative ; in absolute terms the island of Britain , stripped of its Empire , is more prosperous than at any time in its history . ) Do nations learn to grow old gracefully ? Or does the traumatic shock induce neurotic symptoms of anger and unease ? The psychology of nations , I suppose , is still pretty much unexplored territory . But it is clear that a relative diminution of national power can bring about what , in individuals , would he called neurotic symptoms . Thus , the nation affected becomes hypersensitive to criticism from the outside . In the ease of Britain , this was seen in the grotesque incident , after the Cuban missile crisis , of the British reaction to a speech by Mr. Dean
