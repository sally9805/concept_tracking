THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment FEW days ago , we received a letter from our friend the long-winded lady , who had been reflecting awhile on her New Year 's Eve : " Not one roan of the amiable company having dinner together at the Adano Restaurant on New Year 's Eve held a lower rank than captain . There were Captain James Ancona , Captain Mickey . Fields , Captain Joe Linder , Captain Bob Freed , and Captain Torn Shaw . Then , there were Assistant Maitre d ' Eddie Femine , Maitre d ' Gigi , Night Manager Harry Spector , Banquet Manager Sonny . Dall , Stage Manager Ernie D'Arnato , Musical Director Sammy Fields ( show music 1 , Musical Director Sammy Bidner ( dance music ) , and Manager Henry . Tobias . These men constituted all the big brass of the Latin Quarter , and they were strengthening themselves at the Adano before going back to their own glittering palace to face the fiercest night of the y ear in the biggest night dub in New York City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  one of those nights when the Empire State Building smokes with light . And it was very early , not yet six o'clock . At that hour , the groups of people patrolling Broadway and the Broadway area neatly all included little children , who were being treated to . their last glimpse of Christmas lights and Christmas trees before having their last dinner of the Old Year and going home to sleep the New Year in . At the Adano , the men from the Latin Quarter were eating their heads off . They started out with fish salad and went on to an tipastn  --  stuffed mushrooms , roasted peppers , artichoke hearts in olive oil , pickled mushrooms , and more . Then they had green salad , linguine with lobster sauce , yards of Italian bread ( both brown and white ) , cheesecake , and coffee . There were also two orders of linguine with white clam sauce , one order of spaghetti with meatballs , one order of veal scallopini with lemon sauce , a great many orders of lobster Fra Diavolo , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine . They were a handsome crowd , too alert-looking to he called worldly and too worldly-looking not to he called worldly . They sat together at a long table that had been arranged down the center of the room for them , and they all wore dark clothes  --  business suits or tuxedos  --  except Mr. Eddie Femine and Mr. Sammy Bidner . Mr. Femine , who is tall and debonair , wore a beige turtleneck , and Mr. Bidner wore a sporty-looking houndstoothchecked jacket with vents at the sides . Mr. Bidner had brought a small saxophone with him , and he played it every time he stood up from his place , halfway down the long table . He stood up very often . Some of his colleagues were late , and every tune a new arrival walked in from the street Mr. Bidner went forward to serenade him . Mr. Bidner walks very lightly and quickly , and he appeals to move without making a sound , as though he remained always an inch or so above the ground and could make a complete turn , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or his expression and without losing a note , of his music . I think he could move quickly backward for a long time without ever needing to look over his shoulder . He has beetling black eyebrows , and the expression of his eyes preserves the same high intensity whether he is looking at a stranger or talking with a friend or making a minute examination of some mysterious point in the near distance . He seems to look through what is present in the room but not beyond it . 1 , Vhen he is not playing his saxophone , his expression is self-contained and at the same time conspiratorial . He appears to live at a high rate of speed , perhaps because he moves so softly . When he plays he crouches slightly , and when he is not playing he stands hack ready to begin playing again . He is either playing or not playing , and his restless , attentive eyes give no sign of what he sees , or of what he notices , and no sign of what he is thinking . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bald pate shines round and unashamed , but he has a thick fringe of black hair around the sides and hack of his head . Along the edges of the room , by the walls , ordinary Adano customers were sitting here and there having dinner , and Mr. Bidner went to each table and played a request tune . Anything he was asked for he played with all his might . There was a balloon master present . Mr. Ernie D'Amato can blow balloons into any shape he pleases : dogs , cats , giraffes  --  even auto-mobiles , I suppose . Some of us at the Adano would have liked to see a bal-loon animal being made , but we had not brought any balloons with us , and Mr. D'Amato 's tuxedo had just count hack from the cleaners ; his pockets were empty ? no balloons . He could only smile regretfully , a toymaker on holiday . That was a busy table . The Adano waiters , who usually move about at dan ordinary pace , flaw up and down the room so fast that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to he still going on when suddenly it was all over and the party began to break up as the men started hack to take up their posts at the Latin Quarter . They went out in twos and threes , all smiling and cheerful , no complaints . Everybody had had a very good dinner . It was still snowing out , but from the Adam to the Latin Quarter is a short distance  --  along Forty-eighth Street and across Seventh Avenue to where the big night club stands on its own small private island between Seventh and Broadway . Assistant Maitre d ' Eddie Femine stayed behind to check the hill . He stood at the bar , reading carefully , while Joe Pariante , night manager of the Adano , watched him . Mr. Fe-mine was very quiet until he came to one item , which caused him to raise his head and look disagreeably at Joe Pariante . ' Two dollars a portion ! Who do you think you arc ? ' he yelled , and then , laughing like a television maniac , he went back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little joke . He was pretending to he an ordinary Cut-turner . Behind the bar , Bob , who looks imperturbable whether he is smiling nr serious , smiled . When the bill was paid , Eddie Femine congratulated Joe Pariante on the food , the wine , the service , and the atmosphere , and wished him a Happy New Year , and left . He was the last of the Latin Quarter crowd to go , and when Josephine , the hat-cheek lady , had seen him out she sat down in the end booth and beamed . Were n't they nice ? ' she said . ' Were n't they nice ? ' Every Adam ) customer gets two warm welcomes from Josephine  --  one welcome on arrival , one on departure . For New Year 's Eve , she wore a black-and-silver tunic dress and her hair was newly rinsed with Miss Clairol 's Moongold . With all the Latin Quarter crowd gone , the Adam. ) seemed very quiet . Joe Pariante leaned against the bar and allowed himself to look wild-eyed for a minute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He came hack to say , ' A party from Radio City Music Hall wants a table for ten at nine-thirty . That was Freddie Pasqualone calling . ' His was the last reservation accepted . The Adam ' was booked up until midnight . It was going to be a big evening , but not yet . The clock said a quarter to seven . There was plenty of time . The waiters began walking around at their ordinary speed , and soon the tables that had been put together for the big party were separated and dressed up with fresh linen and glasses and silver . The Adam stopped looking as though New Year 's Eve were over , and began looking like itself again . Joe Pariante remembered that some of the fish salad was left , and that he wanted to show it around . Fish salad is not on the menu at the Adano . It was specially ordered by the Latin Quarter ahead of time . Shrimp , calamari , and octopus , cut up into small pieces , with lemon , oil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it looks delicious . When it had been admired and exclaimed over , Joe took the dish to the window refrigerator , where people going by on the street can see bottles of wine , a basket of pears and apples and grapes , and antipasto , red and green . " It was still snowing out . Forty-eighth Street in that block is a musicians ' street , with a great many shops selling musical instruments and sheet music , and then there are practice studios and teachers ' studios . Diagonally across from the Adano , the second-floor window of Frank Wolf Drummers ' Supplies was dimly lighted to show glittering tinsel scattered across a row of drums of different colors and sizes  --  there were a royal-blue drum , a pale-blue drum , a turquoise drum , and a pink drum , and two gold drums , one bright and shining and one in dull gold . Through the snow and the darkness , the little window of drums and tinsel looked like a still-life of New Year 's Eve . It would be nice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come hack to the Adano next New Year 's Eve and have exactly the same dinner and make the same jokes , and that Mr. Sammy Bidner would play his saxophone around the room again . But next New Year 's Eve there wo n't be a Forty-eighth Street . A number of houses arc already down , and on weekdays the street is filled with that choking white wreckers ' dust . Forty-eighth Street is going , going . Office Space must he served , but somebody should write a Lament for Forty-eighth Street -- a cheerful lament , because Forty-eighth has always been a cheerful street . And who , by the way , is Freddie Pasqua-lone ? Freddie Pasqualone is a member of the Radio City Music Hall Symphony Orchestra . He plays the trumpet . " Identity AFRIEND tells us that while he was in the International Arrivals Building at Kennedy Airport the other morning the following message boomed from the loudspeakers : " Will the gentleman reading ' Corporate Darwinism ' please report immediately to the information desk ? " Two Guards WE finally went up to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Following signs that read " New Acquisition This Way , " we quickly arrived at the second-floor gallery where it is hung , and stood before " La Terrasse a Sainte-Adresse " among a respectful group of matrons and art students . Keeping us at the proper distance were a rope supported by two stanchions and , to its left , a uniformed museum guard , with whom we struck up a conversation . He was a personable young man named Eugene Erickson , who turned out to be enthusiastically knowledgeable about art and to be a painter himself . With a little urging , he brought from his breast pocket a sheaf of color photographs of his work . We admired both his technique and the variety of his subjects , among which were studies of paintings in the gallery . We asked if he found it frustrating to stand all day surrounded by art . " I can paint at night , and I get so I can paint things I like here from memory , " he said . " I get two days off a week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We asked what kinds of things people said to him as he stood guard . " Mostly , they ask how much the picture cost , " he told us sadly . " And they ask how old Monet was when he painted it . He was twenty-seven . " We guessed that Mr. Erickson was about twenty-se Yen . We wandered off to see the Renoirs and the Cezannes , and when we passed through the Monet gallery on our way out we noticed that there had been a change of guards , and that another personable young man in uniform was now standing , with his arms folded , to the left of the New Acquisition . Pressing our luck , we decided to see what hr had to say about painting . " I can take it for about ten or fifteen minutes , and then I have to walk around , " he told us . " It gets boring , you know . " We asked whether he did any painting himself . " I hate painting , " he said . ? MHERE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance to the Princeton Cemetery , un Princeton , New Jersey . Shelter BYmidnight last Wednesday , a city bus marked " Special " had picked up seventeen people and taken them to the headquarters of the 1st Howitzer Battalion , 369th Artillery , New York Army National Guard , in Harlem . They were mainly women and children from Harlem , together with a small contingent from Clinton Street , in lower Manhattan . Most of them had had no heat in their apartments for more than a week , during the longest cold period in five years , and they had come to the Armory , on an open invitation from the city , to get warm and stay warm there while their apartments remained unheated . At that point , the city had received about a hundred thousand heat complaints and had organized emergency shelters in every borough except Staten Island . Several heavily bundled-up men , all representatives of one city agency or another , moved about the lobby of the Armory , taking names and addresses as the seventeen people came in . Some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others arrived with only the clothes they were wearing . They had been told that they would he fed , and most of them lacked facilities for cooking any way , so few of them had eaten . One , a young mother dragging three children  --  aged seven , five , and two years  --  and carrying an infant , wanted to know if she could get Similar for the bab3 , who was seven weeks old . Shr also wanted to know if someone at the Armory would look after the children while she went hack to her apartment for the night to watch over her possessions . A man from the Department of Rai-cation and Management Services told her that he would try to find someone . There to help were Mrs. Beraneece Sims and Mr. James Harrell . Mrs. Sims and a group of tenants had asked the May or for city assistance in getting people out of cold buildings , and early in the evening she had installed herself in a phone booth in the lobby . She is the assist:int director of a private organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whom she calls Brother Harrell , is its chief organizer . They both work with Jesse Gray , father of the rent strike , and their organization , which has a staff of eight , " helps tenants all over . " A stout-spirited woman who , with her husband and their two grown children , moved to New York from Berkeley , California , direr and a half years ago , Mrs. Sims told Os that she had read about the rent strikes when she was on the Coast , and that , following the death of her husband , five months after they came here , she had begun doing volunteer work . " We do anything that concerns easing a tenant 's life , " she said matter of-facdy. " 1 , Are fight landlords , organize buildings , get rent strikes going , and get inspections . And we 're in court every singlc day that court is in session . " It was around nine-thirty when Mrs. Sims was telling us about her work , and as she talked , gleeful and excited screams from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hard to ignore . " This is the first time in a week that those children have stretched their legs , " she said , turning in their direction . " They live in an apartment on Manhattan Avenue , and they 've been either all in bed , huddled together to keep warm , or huddled around the gas so we in the kitchen . To tell the truth , they 've not had more than a couple of hours of heat at a time for years . We pushed the landlord to get a new boiler . Now lie 's taken out the old boiler , and until he installs the new one there 's no holler at aIl . That building has another distinction , too . Rats , Not just your average rat  --  which they also have , falling out of the holes in the walls but a new species of white rat . The most ferocious . We do n't know whether it 's albino , or what we have our own rat patrols , you know  --  but they attack . Recently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that had jumped at her . " A number of men had gathered around Mrs. Sims , and seemed engrossed in what she was saying . A man who had just entered gave a slight cough . Mrs. Sims continued , " Their drainpipes have rotted away completely . No mailboxes . They have to go to the post office to get their mail . There are twelve families in that building . Because of the extremely had wiring , there have been several fires . No apartment , though , has burned completely . Tonight , we had a lady with ten children ready to come here . Then she changed her mind . They 're all huddled around the oven , afraid to leave . The biggest problem is that the tenantsare afraid to leave their possessions . Chances are they 'd he cleaned out while they were gone . They do n't have much , but what they have is theirs , and it 's more than nothing . Some of them said they 'd come at six in the morning . They do n't mind being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coughed now spoke . " How are things shaping up ? " he asked . He added that he was from the Department of Social Services ( formerly and widely known as the Welfare Department ) . Mrs. Sims said that although only sixteen people had arrived so far , the Armory could accommodate up to a hundred and fifty people . Cots had been set up in two rooms downstairs  --  one room for women and children , the other for men  --  and food was on the way . Shortly before ten , a man from the Emergency and Disaster Service of the Salvation Army bounded into the lobby . " Got any food ? " someone called to him . He said that he had a truck outside and that as soon as he could drive it around to the hack of the building there would be food . Downstairs  --  in the bedrooms , as it were  --  the adults looked relieved as the Salvation Army man and an assistant brought in a coffee urn and a square white box . One of the city men asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot chocolate , " the Salvation Army man said , " Doughnuts ? " Mrs. Sims shouted incredulously . " That 's all right for the adults , but what about the children ? " The man said apologetically that he had been feeding people all day  --  mainly people made homeless by four tenement fires in the area  --  and this was all he had left . Mrs. Sims was due to leave on another bus pickup , but she did not go until she had been assured by the Welfare man that more substantial food would he ordered . At ten-thirty , she and Mr. Harrell hoarded the big , warm bus and told the driver to head for Eighth Avenue . At the first stop , they walked up two worn steps and into a long , pitch-black corridor . Mr. Harrell led the way , and , once he was inside , he turned to give Mrs. Sims a warning . " Be careful and walk slow , " he said , in a low , unexcited voice . " These wooden floors are caked with uneven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs . One or two of them , as I recall , are missing . " Mrs. Sims seemed determined to he cheerful . " Hello ? " she called out , the cheerfulness apparently coming with some effort . " It 's us . With the bus . Is everybody ready ? Hello ! " She told us she knew the building well . Like many other buildings in Harlem , it had no superintendent . Mrs. Sims called out again , reached the third floor , and knocked on a door . A man opened it but showed no sign of recognition . She explained why she was there , saying that one of her staff people had spoken to him and he had indicated he wanted to go . The man began telling her there was a busted boiler in the basement . " I know . I know , " Mrs. Sims said patiently . " Come with us , wo n't you ? We have a bus to take you where it 's warm , and you can stay there until the boiler is fixed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but after some more talk he said that his wife , in bed in the other room , had the flu , and that it was just too cold to take her out . He seemed a little embarrassed , and added , " Maybe we can come in the morning . " Mrs. Sims smiled and told him that would he fine , and then she started a slow , careful descent of the icy stairs . Across the street , the situation was much the same . On the first floor , Mrs. Sims attempted to shut out at least a blast of icy air from an open window , but as she reached the window , she saw first that the casing was rotten and then that there were no panes . Upstairs , a man answered her knock and said that his wife was sick and they could n't go . As she was leaving , she met another tenant , a middle-aged woman , who was climbing the stairs to her apartment , on the third floor . " Hi ! " Mrs. Sims called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The woman smiled and asked how Mrs. Sims was . " Coming with us ? " Mrs. Sims asked . " We got a bus to take You and the kids . " The woman smiled . " We 're gon na come in the morning , " she said quietly . Then , lowering her voice and nodding in the direction of the apartment that Mrs. Sims had just visited , she said , " And I 'm going to bring her , too . It 's hard on her . She 's sick  --  got a had leg , and she has to he helped down the stairs . She weighs three hundred pounds , you know . " Undaunted , Mrs. Sims said goodnight and made her way out to the street . Mr. Harrell lived nearby , and she asked him if he 'd like to hr dropped off . " I 'm staving until the job is done , " he said , and the two of them climbed back into the bus . They went next to a building on Lenox Avenue near I 38th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around behind them . " I knew it , " she said to Mr. Harrell . " This staircase has already collapsed once , and look at it now . Propped up by three little boards . Well , let 's try to get upstairs . " She started humming . At the top of the stairs , she called out , " E everybody ready ? " " Right here , " a sturdy-sounding young woman 's voice said . " I 'm ready . " A door opened , and Mrs. Sims went into a small kitchen . The oven and three burners on top of the stove were on . She took off her coat . " Mrs. Sims , will going to the Armory help us get in the project ? " the young woman said . " I do n't know , " Mrs. Sims said , " but it might help us get this building fixed . " " Well , I got my soap and my wash-rag and a towel , in case I can get near some hot water to take a bath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commented on the kitchen curtains , which were white and looked freshly laundered . " When I came in here the other morning , with all that stuffing in that hole , they were still standing three feet away from that window , " the young woman said . " There 's so much ice on the living-room windows  --  they 're broken , too  --  that I have n't even been able to take down my Christmas wreaths . " For the next few minutes , Mrs. Sims and the young woman discussed a rent strike against the building , which the young woman was participating in . Some of the people in the building were afraid to withhold their rent to get proper services , she said . " Well , the tenants who organize very soon learn their rights , " Mrs. Sims said . " We 'll just have to keep plugging away . " On the way out , the woman left a note for her sixteen-year-old son , beginning , " They have taken me to the Armory on 142nd Street and Fifth Avenue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's apartment . It was opened by another young woman , the mother of four children . " You better come on and go , " the first young woman said . " I got my clock to wake me up on time , and I hope to God I can take a bath . We 'll help you pack the children . " The second young woman smiled shyly and said she 'd wait until morning . Her right arm was bandaged . " What happened to your arm Mrs. Sims asked . The girl said , " When I was bringing the groceries home the other day , I fell on the stairs . " It was eleven-thirty , and this was the last stop for the night . The driver swung the bus around in the middle of the street and headed for Fifth Avenue . A few minutes later , he arrived at the Armory , with one more passenger than he had had when he left an hour before . Inside , the children were still playing . In the bedrooms , each of the cots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  had a blanket on it , but although some of the adults were sagging , no one seemed quite ready to sleep . The was nine degrees and falling
