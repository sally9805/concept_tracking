Mr. Pelletiere is a staff writer on the San Francisco Chronicle . San Francisco Frederick C Auforth , Regisnar of Charitable Trusts for the state of California , is currently fighting with the local division of the American Cancer Society over some 54 million Auforth says the division is hoarding this amount , refusing to spend it on cancer victims The division , of course , denies the charge . The dispute has wide significance because foundations ( among which private charities like the Cancer Society are included ) are growing at a dramatic rate and supervision over them is inadequate . California attempts to keep a strict watch on such organizations , but its vigilance is not typical . Only a handful of states have tried even to register the foundations doing business within their borders . The Internal Revenue Service 's policy toward them has been most per-missive The Registrar in Califoinia. by presuming to tell the richest subdivision of America 's largest voluntary health organization how it can spend its money , is walking into nrE NA-rioisi/October 23 , 1967a job which no one hitherto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has dared undertake . The fight started last June , when Auforth wrote to the division 's de facto head , Executive Vice President Allen Kolb , asking why the division was saving up so much money . Auforth 's records showed that in 1963 , the American Cancer Society in California had assets , in round figures , of $5 million , by 1964 they had grown to $6 million ; by 1965 to $7 million and , after a record year in 1966 , to $8.5 million . ( Under its charter , the division hands over to the national office 40 per cent of what it collects in its annual fund drive , but Auforth 's figures represent amounts held in California after the central headquarters got its cut . ) Registrar Auforth 's letter was not released to the newspapers , but the San Francisco Chronicle got hold of a copy , and one of its reporters went straight to Kolb . He is a ruddy , affable man who drinks black coffee continuously . Over a cup , in his spacious offices , he seemed inclined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Registrar was raising a storm over nothing more important than different bookkeeping styles . For 401 example , the division pays before it goes , taking cash on hand as of August 31 , the end of its fiscal year , and applying it to the next year 's projected expenses . In this way , Kolb said , the division could have on hand $8.5 million as of August 31 , 1966 , and still  --  as of September 1 , 1966 ? commit the entire sum . That in fact is what happened , he said , and offered the following breakdown : Of the $8.5 million , some $4 million was earmarked for operating state and county headquarters in 1966-67 ; $2.5 million was tied up in restricted legacies , and $2 million remained in uncommitted funds , of which $1.5 million represented a " program supplementation fund " and $500,000 a general purpose reserve . According to Kolb , the only money the division was hanging onto was that last half million . The reporter wanted to know what the general purpose reserve was for . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its own . After giving its 40 per cent to National , it financed individual cancer research projects at California schools , and provided patient care for cancer victims in California counties . When these individual projects were in need of cash , they dipped into the general purpose reserve . But as Kolb explained it , the program supplementation fund and the general purpose reserve seem to perform much the same function . As for the " restricted legacies , " it turned out that the bulk of them was actually one legacy , a $2 million bequest , left to the division in 1947 by Irene Dernham , and scheduled , according to the terms of the bequest , to he liquidated by 1970 Yearly , it awards Dernham Fellowships to promising young scientists who will do cancer research in California schools . Under the terms of Miss Dernham 's will , the division , not the American Cancer Society , administers this sizable trust . Auforth 's letter and Kolb 's explanation appealed in the Chronicle on June 25 . No attempt was made to put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation of the respected Cancer Society was provocation enough . The following day , the Registrar 's offices were overrun with reporters and television people . To these , Auforth refused comment other than to repeat his letter . In San Francisco , Kolb reiterated his explanation that the Division 's reserve was only $500,000 . Not one of the reporters questioned Kolb further . That says a good deal for the prestige of the Cancer Society , for Kolb 's explanation was really full of contradictions . For example , if the $1 5 million program supplementation fund and the smaller $500,000 general purpose reserve perform the same function , why separate them by label ? And someone should have asked how much of these two funds was used last year . As it turned out , the program supplementation fund was tapped for only $78,000 ; the general purpose reserve was never touched . Why tie up more than $2 million in two reserves , from which you draw such a piddling amount ? Another question which should have been raised was how much of the Dernham Trust had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to the division in 1963 , valued at slightly more than $2 million . By 1967 its value had increased to $2 3 million . It 402 seemed that the division was spending only the income on Dernham Fellowships . For example , last year the trust , invested in U.S. Treasury stocks , earned $96,000 ; the division paid out $115,000 to twenty-six Dernham Fellows . At that rate the division could count on still having a sizable chunk of the Dernham money ten years hence , long after the total bequest is supposed to have been spent . It did appear , from Kolb 's explanation and subsequent findings , that the division was accumulating a tremendous amount of capital . At least $2 million , if the $1.5 million program supplementation fund was considered reserve , plus the general purpose reserve  --  more than $4 million , if you also counted the Dernham Trust . Kolb had replied to Auforth in the press , but had still to answer him directly . This he did on July 25 His letter reinforced all of Auforth 's and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Chronicle 's story and Kolb 's letter to Auforth , the division took steps which , in effect , practically wiped out the program supplementation fund . Big chunks of it were plowed into cancer fighting projects : $430,000 went , in the form of a contribution , to National for research ; $41,000 went for Cytology Fellowships ; $150,000 was transferred to the Dernham Fund to buy more Dernham Fellowships . And Kolb promised to spend another $600,000 of the program supplementation fund in 1967-68 . The next to last item , the transferral of $150,000 to the Dernham , is the most revealing . The Trust is supposed to be exhausted by 1970 , but instead of working it down , the division was squirreling another $150,000 into its account ! That makes no sense , unless the purpose was to unburden the division of an awkward accumulation of cash . On August 28 , Auforth again wrote Kolb , to make this point and to raise again all the same points about the Dernham , the general purpose reserve and the program supplementation fund , cited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : We must continue to pose the question of the necessity for steadily increasing accumulation of your capital over the past four years Our further look at this matter leads us to believe that , even on a most cons ? , vahve hems ( italics supplied ) there is an excess accumulation of capital at August 31 , 1966 , which amounts to $1 9 million . This excess capital , together with the Dernham Fund , repiesents a total sum of $4,248.000 which the Society should make definite plans to disburse for its intended purposes in the near future Auforth 's letter appeared in the Chronicle on August 31 . The division asked the Chronicle for space to answer it . However , their reply made no mention of the $1.9 million , nor did it offer any explanation of the transfer of cash from the program supplementation fund to the Dernham . It insisted that " what Mr. Auforth calls excessive accumulation is actually money received from legacies . " The answer then went on to explain that the division depended on legacies to finance local cancer projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then it dips into its legacy reserve to keep its local THE NArioN/actober 23 , 1967 projects going . Of course , this only raises another question : Why , when the division has $1.5 million lying around practically untouched , plus $500,000 definitely untouched , does it need to finance anything with its legacy money ? The division-Registrar battle is only beginning . It will undoubtedly drag on for some while  --  especially as the Attorney General became personally involved after the last round of letters . So it 's really too early to draw conclusions . Out of fairness to the division , though , one point ought to be made . The division , apparently , is not doing anything illegal . It can account for every dollar it ever took in through its fund drives and from bequests . On the other hand , this fact alone constitutes serious criticism . It appears that the division not only can account for all its money but is still holding onto a large portion of it . Kolb , in short , is running the division like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a business . For example , the division 's money was disposed of as follows before it paid off National last year : $6 million was in savings accounts ; $320,000 in checking accounts ; $1.5 million in Time Certificates of Deposit , and $2 million in investments , of which all but $150,000 was in United States Government securities . ( These are only the outstanding sums . ) If one thing can be said about this method of investing , it is that it is safe . The bulk of the division 's money is in banks . In fact , Kolb told Au-forth it was the National 's policy to insist on banking its money  --  to avoid stock speculation . That is an excellent way for a charity to operate  --  if that charity is dedicated to licking its disease quickly , since then its money will be spent almost as soon as it gets it . But , the division clearly is n't trying to land a knockout blow . By spending only the income from the Dernham Trust , by holding back millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crusade may falter , it is evidently gearing for perpetuity . This may be good business but in the end it mainly benefits the banks . An example should suffice to show how this comes about One of Auforth 's auditors told the Chronicle that the Dernham Trust came to the division as a most impressive stock portfolio . After the division had reinvested the money , its yield went way down . Over all , the division 's money is earning less than 6 per cent interest . Considering the amount it has to invest , a good stockbroker could get it more than twice that amount , and do so by investing in blue chip stocks , about which there would be very little uncertainty . Even at this early stage of the investigation it may be possible to place some blame , because the division does seem to be unduly influenced by the banks . In the minutes of its June 15 fund-raising committee meeting , held in Los Angeles , one of its directors stated that the division was depositing " upwards of $8 million a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also general manager and vice president of one of California 's largest banks . There are three main areas in which a private charity , such as the American Cancer Society , can abuse its tax-exempt status : ( 1 ) if its trustees speculate with its assets ME NATION/October 23 , 1967 for personal gain ; ( 2 ) if it spends the bulk of its money on fund raising and administration and , finally , if it accumulates its money , refusing to disburse it for its intended purposes . This last practice seems to be a particular failing of the business intellect , which sees nothing wrong in building up large cash reserves . From the standpoint of the cancer victim , however , it certainly is n't right . The millions of dollars safely socked away in bank vaults are not fighting the disease . Earlier it was said that California had the strictest control on private charity of any state . That is true , but it needs qualification . California is doing more than any other state , but the activity is still woefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two auditors . There are 7,500 charitable trusts ( private charities included ) in the state , controlling more than $2.5 billion in assets . By no stretch of the imagination can two auditors ride herd on 7,500 trusts with that much money . Auforth has requested eight additional auditors plus a deputy . If he gets them  --  and the Cancer fight may be enough to shock the legislature into granting his request ? California will then have , not only the best trust regulatory body in the country but the only one equipped to do an effective job . The abuses a really effective Registry could uncover might bring about regulation on the federal level . Antaeus and Hercules ( Continued from page 390 ) decline in the private sector .
