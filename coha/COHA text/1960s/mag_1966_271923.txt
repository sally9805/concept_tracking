Want success as a TV variety show star ? Relax . <P> Perry Como and Andy Williams proved the rule , though their effortlessness had to be rehearsed . To produce a 60-minute program , Como tapes for as much as two days , Williams for up to eleven hours . Now both of them are being outrelaxed by a competitor so genuinely casual that he ca n't be bothered with a real rehearsal or even a retake . As a result , The Dean Martin Show is hoisting itself ever higher in the ratings and is the closest thing on the air to the free and easy spontaneity of old-fashioned live television . <P> Host Martin is a slightly blue rhinestone-in-the-rough , fortunately set in an afterhours time slot ( 10-11 p.m. , E.S.T. ) when the youngsters are in bed and he need play nobody but himself . Como and Williams , he says , are for " the milk-and-cookies crowd . This is my show . " His fans include Henry Miller and a satisfying 38% of the big-city Nielsen sample . As Actor Anthony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to be plagued by responsibility , hemmed in by convention . Dean is the symbol of the guy who can go on , get drunk , have no responsibilities . " <P> Tense Spaghetti . With more than a hint of envy , a writer of another series observes : " Dean does everything he should n't do , but on him it 's funny . " He squints blatantly at the prompter cards , purposely blows lines . He ignores taboos to snigger at his own gags , bravo his own songs . " This kid 's come a long way , " he says of himself . " I 'd have him back , but he 's too expensive . " Week after week , he repeats the same business : lobbing a cigarette butt into the air like a grenade , then holding his ears as if waiting for the explosion ; or stumbling drunkenly over to the piano to croon a few bars like " It 's June in January/ ' cause I 'm in Australia .

Comedian Bill Cosby was delighted to do a guest bit when he found he could go to a football game on taping day ( Sunday ) instead of rehearsing . For the first time in her career , Lucille Ball found herself able to nap before going on . " You know , " she told Dean , " you make cooked spaghetti look tense . " Returning the favor , Martin took a guest spot with Lucy , disgustedly found himself spending four times as long rehearsing a 20-minute part as he does headlining his own show . <P> Like Benny . Last week , for instance , taping the final effort of the season ( to be aired April 21 ) , Dean gunned his Dual Ghia into the parking lot of NBC studios in Burbank at noon . He spent the first hour or so goofing around with his musical director . At 1 p.m. , the dancers and Guest Stars Liberace , Comedienne Dorothy Loudon and Tanya the Elephant were brought together for the first time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For one thing , Dean did n't bother to take part ; for another , he was breaking out the dressing-room bottle and splashing himself a tall Scotch and water . Then came dress rehearsals , the cue for Martin 's second Scotch and a gagging , ragging appearance onstage . Then dinner break and another Scotch . " We 'd rather have him do it only once and have it fresh , " says Director Greg Garrison . And after dinner , he did it-once and fresh .
