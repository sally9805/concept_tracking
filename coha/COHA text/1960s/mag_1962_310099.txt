Oh , everything is higher , It 's sure outrageous , Yes , everything is higher , Except my daddy 's wages . <P> The kids who sang that Depression ditty 30 years ago could not be more unlike the prosperous youngsters who sing it nowadays at New York City 's private Fieldston School . Yet they are linked in thought and feeling through their history teacher , John A. Scott , 46 , who gives his students a passion for possessing the past as if it were the present . <P> Scott recently staged a smash-hit " New Deal Assembly " at Fieldston , complete with soup kitchen , union songs and F.D.R. speeches . In other years , he has done as much for the Civil and Revolutionary wars . Scott is perhaps the leading practitioner of the most exciting new art in U.S. high school history teaching-throwing away textbooks and going to original sources . <P> Back to Sources . A lean , lively Londoner , Scott came out of Oxford 's Trinity College with a first in " PPE " ( philosophy , politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wound up an American citizen in the wartime U.S. Army ( intelligence ) . He took his doctorate in European history at Columbia and taught for three years at Amherst . Sensing that secondary-school teaching might offer more challenge and satisfaction , he switched in 1951 to Fieldston ( 651 students ) , which is sponsored by New York 's Ethical Culture Society . <P> As chairman of Fieldston 's social-studies department . Scott spends only two hours a day in the classroom-allowing him to pursue his own scholarly research , which in turn he shares with students . He calls textbooks " mere dry husks of facts , " insists that youngsters grapple firsthand with the issues and ideas of history . To convey " the human meaning-how people thought and suffered .

His students do not just vaguely read that Lincoln and Douglas once debated slavery , or skim snatches of rhetoric . They get mimeographed copies ( 30 single-spaced pages ) of the complete Galesburg debate of Oct. 7 , 1858 , a fascinating excursion into ante-bellum schizophrenia that reads like a Broadway play . They read not only Lincoln 's famed Cooper Union address , but also the rarely mentioned reply to it-a brilliant defense of Southern traditions by the Rev. James Henley Thornwell . <P> On to Understanding . Scott is also constantly on the hunt for " ethical images " Americans of conscience and courage who can rouse modern youngsters . While searching for " morally dedicated women " - more than half his students are girls-Scott dug up English Actress Fanny Kemble 's long-out-of-print Journal of a Residence on a Georgia Plantation in 1838-39 .
