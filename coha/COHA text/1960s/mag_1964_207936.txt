The heavy-set man in a neatly pressed blue suit and beret stepped out of War saw 's shabby district court at 127 General Swierczewski Street into a welcoming crowd of 300 , mostly writers and students . They surrounded the old man and patted him on the back . Two girls embraced him and handed him red roses . Said he : " All the nice people seem to be here . " Melchior Wankowicz , 72 , one of Poland 's most popular novelists , had just been convicted by the not-so-nice people in courtroom No. 16 of " slandering the People 's Republic of Poland . " <P> The case was a symptom of what is happening to the once relatively liberal regime of Party Boss Wladyslaw Gomulka . At the start of World War II , Wankowicz fled Nazi-occupied Poland , accompanied Polish army units in the Italian campaign as a war correspond ent , and told their story in his best-selling book Battle of Monte Cassino . Soon after war 's end he settled in the U.S. with his wife and daughter , became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual freedom under Gomulka , he visited Poland in 1958 , then four years later settled in Warsaw permanently . At first he was lionized by the regime . But last March he joined 33 leading Polish intellectuals in issuing a sharp protest against growing intellectual repression . <P> Promptly the police obtained retractions from a majority of the signers , but Wankowicz was one of a dozen who refused to recant . Then suddenly , on the night of Oct. 5 , he was arrested . Chief evidence produced at his trial was a speech critical of the government that he had written in June ; he never delivered it , but had allegedly sent a copy to his daughter in Washington . Under a decree dating back to the Stalin era , Wankowicz was sentenced to three years in prison . The judge cut the sentence in half because of a recent amnesty and allowed him to go home pending appeal . <P> By Stalinist standards this was mild treatment , but was nevertheless clear warning to Polish intellectuals to stop their criticism . To judge , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least some of them were flouting that warning .
