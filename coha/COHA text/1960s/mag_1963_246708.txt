A shock wave of horror raced through Saigon last week . In a small park inside Saigon 's main traffic circle , a young Buddhist priest at noon squatted cross-legged in the traditional lotus position , pulled a plastic container of gasoline out of his cloth bag and soaked his lap . Then he struck a match to his brown robes . Flames burst over him . Grimacing but uttering no sound , the monk shriveled into a charred skeleton . After three minutes , his arms stiffened before him , and he pitched over . It was the sixth suicide by fire in the Buddhist struggle against President Ngo Dinh Diem . <P> From the curious crowd which had gathered , a low moan arose . A little girl whimpered in her mother 's arms ; a woman laughed hysterically ; tears streamed down the cheeks of old women . A traffic cop grabbed a straw hat off one woman 's head , tried to put out the fire by waving it over the flames , succeeded only in making them blaze higher . Three U.S. newsmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ground by plainclothesmen who tried to seize a newsreel camera ( see PRESS ) . <P> The afternoon of the immolation , presumably to soothe the populace , government loudspeakers newly installed in trees near the traffic circle began blaring music . There were Vietnamese songs , French songs , Viennese waltzes and-either by accident or contemptuous design-that old Tin Pan Alley favorite , Smoke Gets in Your Eyes . <P> <P> At Dalat , 140 miles northeast of Saigon , the government faced a Buddhist problem of a different nature : what to do about an aged nun who , by reputation at least , has been flitting about the countryside working miracles . Known simply as " the Saint , " she first appeared , according to rumor , on a mountain-top and began turning water from a dirty stream into miraculously clean holy water . A father reported that she cured his daughter 's acne ; two little boys who were mutes were taken to her , have since started uttering sounds . As word of her feats spread , Buddhist faithful by the thousands began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Taking no chances that the pilgrims might turn into antigovernment demonstrators , authorities called out troops , banned the processions on grounds that the trails were too dangerous . " The Saint " has since disappeared-but she has assertedly promised to reappear on six other mountaintops.
