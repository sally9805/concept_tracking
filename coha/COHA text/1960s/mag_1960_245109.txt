( See Cover ) The green phone - phone-green to match the office walls - rang imperiously . New York City , said the long-distance operator , was calling Mr. James Reston , and in a moment Mr. Reston , Washington correspond ent of the New York Times , was talking to Adlai Stevenson . The titular head of the Democratic Party , a longtime Reston admirer , confidant and news source , was getting ready for his South American tour , and he wanted to know if the Times in tended to cover it . As a matter of fact , Stevenson hinted , it would be dandy if Reston himself went along . Well , no , said Reston , he could not go , but he assured his caller that the Times would - as it has in the last eight years - give ample cover age to Adlai Stevenson . <P> A short time after his talk with Stevenson , " Scotty " Reston put through a call of his own to the junior U.S. Senator from Arkansas , Democrat J. William Fulbright , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reston friend and source . This time , the Washington correspondent had an assignment for the Senator . Reston had been brooding about the problems that would face a newly elected U.S. President , " that exhausted man who stumbles across the line the first of November , " with but eleven weeks before taking office in January . <P> Would n't it be useful , suggested Reston , to prepare the President-elect for the or deal of office , with 1 ) summaries of the studies of the presidential work load drafted by Eisenhower commissions , and 2 ) a precis of the unfinished business left by the departing President ? And , he added in his quietly persuasive way , how states manlike for the junior Senator from Ar kansas to propose the performance of such an unselfish service to someone in the Administration - perhaps Douglas Dillon , Under Secretary of State . Fulbright agreed to give the idea full consideration. * <P> Where Is Mr. Reston ? The middle-sized ( 5 ft. 8 in. , 158 Ibs. ) , middle-aged ( 50 ) man who gives assignments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of such mild ways and unassuming mien that he could easily get lost in the legions of the Washington press . But he sticks out of it so far that an awestruck fellow columnist once was moved to compare his altitude with that of the Deity . In Poland last summer , U.S. newsmen traveling with Vice President Nixon were nettled at the inquiry of their hosts : " Where is Mr. Reston ? ' ' <P> Mr. Reston is usually where the best story is . A crack reporter , a good writer , a thoughtful columnist , and an able administrative chief of the biggest newspaper bureau ( 23 staffers ) in Washington , he brings to his job a sober , Calvinistic sense of responsibility . He has never had a private audience with President Eisenhower ( or with any other U.S. President ) , but that does not mean that Presidents are unaware of him . " Who does Scotty Reston think he is , " Ike once complained , " telling me how to run the country ? "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
