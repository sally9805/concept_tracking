VOYAGER : A LIFE OF HART CRANE by John Unterecker. 787 pages . Farrar , Straus &; Giroux. $15 . <P> <P> " A rip-tooth of the sky 's acetylene . " <P> Thus Hart Crane in " To Brooklyn Bridge " describes the noon light biting into Wall Street . As a poet , Crane sought " surrender to the sensations of urban life . " Out of such sensations , he said , he hoped to forge " a mystical synthesis of America , " for which ( he told his perplexed patron , Otto Kahn ) " one might take the Sistine Chapel as an analogy . " <P> He knew his Whitman " like a book , " Robert Lowell has written , but Whitman was too great an invitation to incoherence , and " The Bridge " is at times incoherent . Crane admitted that in some of his short lyrics the words were chosen in fits of wine-induced ecstasy to the blare of jazz on a victrola . The idea was that the thoughts would blend and fertilize each other magically . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seem as imperishable as Blake 's . But the magic failed , so the 1920 critics said , when applied to the epic that Crane had it in his heart to write . <P> Flung Typewriters . Today , however , the splendor of Crane 's intention is winning him a more tolerant audience . This is especially true among poets sharing his faith in the word as " object . " It is also true among academic critics like Columbia 's John Unterecker , whose Voyager is the second serious study of Crane 's life to appear since Philip Horton 's adventurous Hart Crane : The Life of an American Poet ( 1937 ) . <P> Big , expensive , documented from all sides , Voyager pays Crane the usual tribute of trying to understand him in perspective . This is n't always easy . The word was actually " made flesh " for Crane in love affairs with sailors . He threw typewriters out of windows . " I saw all the trees below his window festooned with the typewriter ribbon , " a friend remembers . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows everything that his acquaintances have him tossing , most of America , half of Europe , and all of Mexico would still be littered with far-flung typewriters . " He invaded the lives of his many good friends the way his parents invaded his . The complex emotions of his life , " twisted with the love of things irreconcilable , " make his brief career long in the telling . <P> Greeting Cards . It appears that to enter into the mysterious personality from which the poems came , as well as the problem of why the poems were so few , it is necessary not only to know Crane but to know his divorced parents as well . His father , a successful self-made candy manufacturer , was the inventor of Life Savers ; his mother , unhappy , nervous , was preternaturally possessive . Crane and each of his parents , Unterecker explains , " concerned with immense problems , anxiously kept them from the other two . " Yet each kept " guessing and misunderstanding the motives and actions of the others . " To know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cranes destroyed each other in the language of greeting cards . The correspondence is a trial to biographer and reader , especially in view of the sickening domestic sentimentality that surrounded all the Cranes .
