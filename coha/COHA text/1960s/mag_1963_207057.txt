For a man so insistent on having his own sensibilities taken into account , Charles de Gaulle has a gargantuan capacity for being indifferent to everyone else 's . Last week , having stood France 's friends and neighbors on their ears , De Gaulle triumphantly surveyed the scene for the benefit of some 120 newly elected National Assembly Deputies in a reception at Elyse Palace . <P> De Gaulle , whose attitude toward economics is vague at best , loftily explained to the Deputies why the U.S. wanted Britain in the Common Market : " The Americans are giving away their products to the South Americans , the Africans , and even the Arabs . Therefore they must try to sell them in Europe , which can pay for them . " This was wildly inaccurate : U.S. sales to Japan and Canada alone in 1962 totaled almost twice as much as its $3.6 billion in exports to the Common Market . With Britain 's exclusion , said le grand Charles , the U.S. is now " making use of England " to create " a vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so forth . " Then De Gaulle turned his remarks to the West Germans , for whom he had some advice on how to govern themselves . " What is needed in Germany , " he declared , " is a constitution that would permit it to face modern conditions . " ( Germany 's constitution was drafted and adopted in 1949 . ) <P> Change of Tone . De Gaulle 's most derisive comments were aimed at Harold Macmillan and his countrymen , who " always manage to seem so respectable . " Describing the Prime Minister 's talks with him at Rambouillet last December , he related : " Mr. Macmillan came to tell me we were right in making our force de frappe . ' We have our own , too , ' he told me . ' We should try to associate them in a European framework independent of America . ' On this , he left me for the Bahamas . " There , according to De Gaulle , Macmillan betrayed him by agreeing instead to accept Polaris force from the U.S. and then to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombers , to a multinational NATO nuclear force . Shrugging that this " naturally changed the tone " of the Jan. 14 press conference at which De Gaulle gutted Britain 's hopes of joining Europe , De Gaulle added testily : " Mr. Macmillan , whom I like , has had the British press compare me to Hitler and even to Napoleon . " <P> In London , irate British officials were offended at the idea that Macmillan could dictate Fleet Street 's line , even if he wanted to . Perhaps , they suggested acidly , he was confusing Britain 's free press with France 's , where De Gaulle 's side pronouncements and little witticisms are fed to the Paris press by the palace guard . A great many talkative Deputies had heard De Gaulle 's comments at his palace reception , and the state-owned news agency had sent them out on the wire . Nonetheless , when the reverberations began , the palace grandly issued a warning that the public " once again be on guard against the publication of so-called declarations of General de Gaulle .
