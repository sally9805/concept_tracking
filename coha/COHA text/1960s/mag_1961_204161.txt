Twenty-seven years in India 's elite civil service gave brilliant , Oxford-trained Rajeshwar Dayal an elegant diplomatic manner and endless Oriental patience . But this was hardly enough to prepare Dayal for the heat , hatred and hurly-burly of central Africa when U.N . Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold named him chief of the U.N . mission in the Congo last August . Almost before Dayal had settled into his glass-walled office in Lopoldville , chaos broke around his head . Erratic Patrice Lumumba wanted protection in his refuge in the Premier 's residence . From his own villa near by , President Joseph Kasavubu sulked and hurled insults at the U.N . One afternoon Colonel Joseph Mobutu strode into Dayal 's office , asked for a slug of Scotch , and announced that a coup d ' tat would take place within ten minutes . <P> The untrained politicians clearly got on his delicate nerves . The Congolese army , he declared publicly , was " rabble , " and the local press angrily quoted him as calling Army Boss Mobutu a " bandit . " In time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrew to haughty isolation in his own elegant residence . When , after Lumumba 's death , he seemed to lean over backward to favor Antoine Gizenga 's Red-leaning Stanleyville regime , Dayal also lost the trust of the big Western nations . <P> When Hammarskjold called Dayal back to U.N . Manhattan headquarters for " consultation " in March , nearly everybody sighed with relief . U.N . relations with the Congolese improved spectacularly , and the U.S. gently urged Hammarskjold to keep Dayal in Manhattan indefinitely . Finally , last week , controversial Rajeshwar Dayal announced his resignation . As soon as he can pack his bags , he will return to his old job as India 's High Commissioner to Pakistan , where good diplomatic manners and endless Oriental patience still had a certain value .
