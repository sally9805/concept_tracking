Chasing a 14-year-old Negro burglary suspect , a cop pulled his revolver , fired and wounded the boy in the neck . Moments later , the neighborhood swarmed with outraged Negroes . In the streets and from rooftops , several hundred Negroes hurled stones and bottles at police , as two dozen patrol cars with four dog teams screamed into the area . Negro vandals broke into a tavern , stole whisky and beer , started a fire , and then stoned firemen who answered the alarm . <P> This was not Birmingham . It was Chicago , with one of the nation 's biggest , most potentially explosive Negro ghettos . In the wake of the Birmingham violence , Chicago 's Negroes have been gathering in street-corner sympathy meetings and protest marches . But a more basic reason for Chicago 's racial disturbances is to be found in a welfare crisis that has been seething throughout Illinois for months . <P> Pushcarts &; Shopping Bags . The state 's Negroes , about 1,000,000 of whom are jammed in Chicago 's South and West Side slums , get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Payments for aid to dependent children-of whom 65,000 are illegitimate-run to $150 million a year . Of the more than 50,000 women who give birth to children while on relief , 87% ( three-quarters of them Negroes ) are either unmarried or are not living with their husbands . <P> The crisis blew up in March when the state senate refused to approve a $5,100,000 emergency appropriation to cover welfare payments for May and June . The legislators wanted new ceilings clamped on payments to individual families , which sometimes exceeded $500 a month . While Illinois ' ineffectual Democratic Governor Otto Kerner bargained and pleaded with the senate , 352,000 people on the relief rolls began to go hungry . <P> At length , federal shipments of surplus foods , along with contributions from individuals and private businesses , began flowing into depots set up around Chicago . In scenes reminiscent of the Depression breadlines , Negroes queued up for four days to get 35 Ibs. of food per person . Jostling , weeping , the people shoved their pushcarts and shopping bags into the dispensing lines and hauled away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had vowed never to sign a bill with a welfare ceiling , gulped down his promise , approved a compromise bill that henceforth will limit the amount of money given to any one welfare family . <P> But the end of the race crisis in Chicago is not yet in sight . Says the Urban League 's Executive Director Edwin C. Berry : " We have a possibly explosive situation here . My messages from the beer gardens and the barbershops all indicate the fact that the Negro is at war . All the ingredients of race riot are here . "
