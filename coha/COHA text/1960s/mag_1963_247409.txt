Selling life insurance in India is something like selling sand in the Sahara . Though most Indians may not believe that life insurance causes death , many of them do feel that it defies and tempts the gods . For many Indians , furthermore , land seems the only smart investment , and attempts to sell them insurance are repulsed as schemes to snatch their money . There is , of course , little enough of that ; the per capita income in India is only $69 a year , and people are so busy trying to keep alive that they have little time to worry about death . <P> Despite these massive disadvantages , India 's state-owned Life Insurance Corp . is doing a remarkable job of selling its product . More than $1.6 billion in new policies were written during the 1962-63 fiscal year , more than triple the rate just seven years ago , when the Indian government nationalized all of India 's life insurance business and formed the Life Insurance Corp . Under dapper , cigar-puffing Chairman B. K. Kaul , a veteran Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion and assets $1.5 billion . <P> With 82% of India 's people still living outside the cities and towns , this growth has required an ingenious array of promotional devices to reach the villagers . Agents are trained to sell " life insurance for living " with policies that pay for retirement or for the marriage of a daughter as well as death benefits . The company explains the value of insurance with short feature films , primarily for rural audiences , that have simple plots , amateur talent , and sound tracks in the 13 main Indian languages . Itinerant bards , telling stories and singing insurance commercials , wander from village to village . Everywhere possible , in signs , posters , newspaper ads and leaflets , appears the company 's symbol : a pair of hands shielding the flame of a peasant oil lamp and a sacred quotation in Sanskrit that means " Your welfare is my responsibility . " <P> In the process of so convincing Indians , the Life Insurance Corp . has become India 's major financial giant . By law , half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry , and it is a rare firm of any size in India 's capital-starved economy that does not have the Life Insurance Corp . as a major shareholder . The company also has a reputation as a powerful stabilizer of the Indian stock market . A year ago , when the Red Chinese attack threw Indian exchanges into panic , it restored morale by sopping up $2,100,000 worth of just one stock , market-leading Tata Iron &; Steel Co . So far , however , L.I.C. has kept its hands off the management policies of firms it buys into . It expresses its disapproval only by reducing its investment .
