JEFFERSON DAVIS by Hudson Strode . 556 pages . Harcourt , Brace &; World . $7.50 . <P> With perverse sentimentality , posterity often remembers history 's losers more fondly than the luckier or more competent heroes who beat them . But nothing like this Joan of Arc or Mary Queen of Scots effect has occurred in the case of Jefferson Davis . The public memory retains his name , but his deeds and character are dimmer than Hannibal 's . Perhaps it is because Davis refused to let himself be forgiven , and went on proclaiming the Tightness of the South 's cause until his death in 1889 . Or it may be that the popular taste for gallant losers is satisfied in this historical instance by the courtly warrior , Robert E. Lee . At any rate , the dimness of Davis ' repute , even among Southerners , is attested by the fact that Hudson Strode 's three-volume biography is not only the best modern work on Davis ; it is virtually the only one . <P> Partisan View . The book is clearly partisan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the University of Alabama , frankly admits that he is presenting " the Southern viewpoint . " He obviously believes that Davis was correct in his fundamentalist reading of the Constitution , that the South was justified in seceding , and that the Civil War was a close parallel to the American Revolution , in that it , too , was a war for independence . His references to slaves almost invariably mention their great loyalty and contentment . This , the third and last volume , bears the title Jefferson Davis : Tragic Hero , and Strode writes in his introduction : " I can find no fatal ' flaw ' in the Davis character like to that which Shakespeare gives his heroes to bring about their own ruin , unless it be a passion he shared with the classic Greeks : an almost fanatical belief in freedom in government . " <P> The reader who stops short of seeing Davis as tragic must admit that he was an extraordinary man , whose best quality was an inflexible devotion to principle . Davis had been a minor but authentic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War under Franklin Pierce and , up to a few weeks before he was called to the presidency of the seceding states , an outstanding member of the U.S. Senate . His maltreatment after the Civil War was shameful . President Andrew Johnson signed a proclamation ridiculously charging him with complicity in the assassination of Lincoln , and he was kept in prison for two years-the first week in leg irons-before being released without a trial . His personal burdens were increased by the death , in infancy or early youth , of his four sons .
