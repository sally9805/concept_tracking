TO WHAT END by Ward S. Just . 209 pages . Houghton Mifflin. $4.95 . <P> Most of the books fathered by the Viet Nam war and mothered by anxious publishers have been either captious collections of preconceptions or argumentative exercises in polemics . In Viet Nam , says Washington Post Reporter Ward Just , who covered the war there for 18 months , " it was no trick to find the facts to back up the impressions , or the preconceptions : facts were everywhere , and with suitable discrimination could be used to support almost any argument . " To his credit , Just does not argue . To What End is an almost apolitical and unusually successful attempt to convey a sense of Viet Nam 's violent confusion . <P> Just examines the now familiar ambiguities of the war with detail that is not often found in books of this kind . The language barrier , he notes , is so great that neither English nor Vietnamese can be successfully translated one into the other . He points out that since Vietnamese verbs do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More important , perhaps , is the absence of the personal pronoun " I. " Because Vietnamese speak of themselves in the third person , " a man 's identity , his sense of himself , is always in relation to something , or someone else-usually something , or someone , having to do with the village , which is one reason the village is so important in Vietnamese life . " <P> The Whisper . The war became unequivocally real for Just when in June 1966 he joined an elite unit of the 101st Airborne Division for a reconnaissance mission . His description of the ordeal contains some of the best combat narrative to come out of Viet Nam . After a daylong fight , in which the 40-man patrol was whittled down by the North Vietnamese , Just found himself trapped in a vulnerable com mand post . It was filling up fast with wounded . Suddenly , the enemy began to lob grenades at them . Suddenly , Just was seized by the realization that there was no way to stop them : <P> " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't know how to fire , when Washburn leaned over and very quietly , very precisely , whispered ' grenade . ' He probably yelled it , but I was switched off , half-dead from the pounding of the artillery and the 500-pound bombs and it seemed to me that the warning came in a whisper . Then he gave me a push . There was a flash and a furious burst of fire ; the grenade had landed a yard away . " The attack was repulsed by a radioman with a grenade launcher , but Just was badly gouged by the shrapnel . <P> Just 's detached and determinedly accurate assessment belongs to a tradition of war reporting that traces back to Thucydides , the ancient historian whose account of the Peloponnesian War is depressingly relevant today . Thucydides was no polemicist either , but his message was clear : the exercise of power , however necessary it may seem , can lead a city-state-or a nation-into unforeseen danger .                  @ @ @
