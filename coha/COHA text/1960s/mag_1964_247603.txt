Take a world championship baseball team.Subtract one starting pitcher . Substitute a .270 hitter for a .330 hitter . Drop some flies , fumble some grounders , miss some bunts , leave runners all over the bases . What you have then is the Los Angeles Dodgers , best seventh-place team in baseball . <P> The 1964 Dodgers may well go down in history as one of the game 's enduring mysteries . On paper , they are practically the same club that won the National League pennant last year and swept four straight from the New York Yankees in the World Series . Sandy Koufax is still the slickest pitcher around , and Don Drysdale may be the runner-up ; between them , they have already won 27 games this year . Shortstop Maury Wills is the same electrifying base runner who stole a record 104 bases in 1962 ( he has 31 so far ) . Catcher John Roseboro , whose lifetime average is .240 , was batting .310before he cut a finger on a foul tip . But still the Dodgers lose : twostraight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four tothe ninth-place Houston Colts . Then those hated San Francisco Giants inflicted an 11-3 thrashing , scoring nine runs in one nightmarish inning . <P> Injuries have hurt , of course . Roseboro will be out of action for a week , and Pitcher Johnny Podres has been idle since May because of a bone chip in his elbow . Outfielder Tommy Davis was hampered early in the season by a shoulder injury-but that scarcely explains how a man who led the National League in batting for two years in a row can be hitting .272 now . Moans Dodger Coach Pete Reiser : " There were at least nine ball games we would have won if Davis could just have hit a long fly . " <P> Last week Manager Walter Alston watched unhappily while the Dodgers lost 1-0 to the Colts-their 19th loss in 30 one-run games this season . Alston was as baffled as everybody else . " You start with the idea that you score so many runs and allow your opponent to score so many , " he said . " Last year at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed , and we were 1 games ahead in first place . This year we have scored 29 more runs than we have had scored against us . The only difference is that we 're not winning . "
