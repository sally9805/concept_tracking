Time was when only five species of vertebrates were known to use tools . <P> There was man , of course . Chimpanzees used rocks to break open hard-shelled food , sticks to feed on termites and ants , and leaves for wiping their bodies and drinking . A gorilla had been seen pulling fruit to within its grasp by means of a crooked branch . The sea otter used rocks for opening shellfish . And Galapagos woodpecker finches probed insects from holes with short twigs . <P> Comes now the Egyptian vulture . <P> Traveling in Tanzania on a National Geographic Society photographic expedition , Zoologist Jane Goodall and her photographer husband Hugo van Lawick came upon an abandoned ostrich nest . Two ostrich eggs left in the nest were under attack by a variety of vultures , which were trying vainly to peck through the tough shells . While the Van Lawicks watched and photographed , they reported last week in Nature , two Egyptian vultures took a novel approach to their problem . <P> Picking up small stones in their beaks , they raised their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the eggs with forceful movements of their heads and necks . Throwing , you might call it . After several hits - and many misses - they successfully broke open the shells and feasted . <P> To verify that the behavior of the two Egyptian vultures was no fluke , the Van Lawicks set out two ostrich eggs at a site some 60 miles away and sat back to see who would cast the first stone . Sure enough , the eggs were promptly attacked by two mature , stone-hurling Egyptian vultures , which aimed wildly , often pausing to threaten each other . After the pair finally had cracked and eaten the eggs , an Egyptian vulture that was lower in the social pecking order approached one of the empty shells and peppered it with 30 rocks , perhaps practicing for the day when he , too , would be lucky enough to have ostrich egg for lunch .
