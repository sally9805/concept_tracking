 | The two laughed in each other 's faces . The wind blew , and Ranulf shouted out above it , " We have taught them how to shave the crowns of clerks ! " They roared . But Hugh de Morville , silent , unsmiling , pushed his mount past them . Fitz Urse and Tracy followed him . " Richard , are you for Saltwood ? " Fitz Urse asked as he brushed by . Brito turned , still grinning . " We taught them how to shave the heads of clerks , " he said . But his grin died even as he spoke and he lurched forward and clutched his comrade 's arm . And suddenly his voice came groaning : " Reginald , that was a blow I struck . My sword leaped from my hand . I could not find it , there in the bloody church , and the monks ' whisper , whisper in the dark .... " " Silence , for God 's sake ! " Fitz Urse roared . " And be a man . What we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no peace for years . Now let us have some peace . " He shook the hand away . Brito drew back . " What we have done . . . . " he echoed . But Fitz Urse raised his voice and shouted over him . " Now it is done , I tell you . Peace , for the love of God ! I tell you it is done ! " Tracy and de Morville , riding ahead , turned at the shout , but no one spoke again . Fitz Urse rode after them and Brito followed . In silence , panting , Ranulf watched them go . And the four knights rode out from Ridingate and down the ancient causeway of Stonestreet , bound for Saltwood Castle and to send word across the Channel to the king in Normandy . Canterbury lay behind . In the dark cathedral the corpse lay where it had fallen , in the north transept beside the bloody pillar , the feet pointing toward the open doorway to the cloister . From outside came the faintest glow from the wet pavement and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind pushed under the arched door and stirred the black and silent air , and on the little altar of St. Benedict the vespers light jumped at the touch of its breath and then sank back . Far away in the heart of the cathedral the antepcndium of  | the high altar , heavy with gold and silver thread , sighed as it dragged its fringe across the marble . There was no other sound . And yet the great church sheltered many men . In cold stone corners they crouched in hiding  --  in the crypt below , in the turret stairway and the chapel of St. Blaize above , in the great empty nave , in the carved stalls of the choir and at every altar the monks knelt , clung , trembled and prayed . And from the west pooh and in all the doorways the frightened citizens peered in , straining for a sign of movement , a rustle or a voice . ' They had been gathering thus , the free men of Canterbury , puree the baron 's men from Saltwood had called on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the citizens refused , the soldiers had turned rough and ordered all indoors , never to stir whatever might be seen or heard . Yet through the darkening city and the storm , as the hour of Vespers came and went , men crept out from this house and that and ran for Christchurch monastery and the cathedral church . Some had been witnesses to murder , kept back by the Lord de Mori ille and his men . But all they saw , across the nave and the black transept , were jumping shadows and the glint of crosier Ond of sword , and all they heard were echoes of an argument , of curses and the clang of steel on stone . A cry of victory . A final v nice : " He wanted to be king and more than a king . Now , let him be the king ! " Then silence , darkness . No one dared move . At last came light . Osbert , the dead archbishop 's chamberlain , had found a candle in the chapter house and now came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pahoned the grounds . At the north transept door he lit it and crossed to the pillar and placed it in the sconce . There at his feet lay the body of his master . Still , composed , the long corpse stretched out on its side . The head was turned face up , as , though a foot had thrust it , and the eyes stared upward into the darkness and the painted ceiling overhead . Across the nose , from the right temple to the left cheekbone , was one red gash , hut otherwise the face was peaceful . And aroonrd the crown there lay a ring of mingled blood and brains , red and white like flowers . t - sheet crossed himself and knelt . He touched the body ,  | touched the head . Then he felt around the dark periphery beyond the candle 's glow , his fingers sticky in the cooling blood , until he found the severed scalp . With a long sobbing sigh he looked up and around him in the shadows but found no one to help . He glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his garments , tore a length from his own shirt , and with it loosely bound the mutilated head . Then he rose and went to seek the infirmarian . From the doorways over across the church the citizens crept forward , one and then another , then the crowd . They came into the light around the corpse and there they knelt . Their hands reached out to touch the body , snatch a thread from the white pallium around the shoulders , clip into the blood upon the floor . Their heads bent down to kiss the garments and the hands . Walter the hunchback , coming behind the others , saw the man in front of him fall on his knees and bending double kiss the embroidered sandal on the dead foot . He saw the corpse , the reaching hands , saw his friend Lambin , master of a royal mint , stretch out a finger to the bandaged scalp and bring it up to touch his own eyes , one and then the other . Walter also knelt . He felt for a dry place beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his short kirtle where it was dry . His hands were shaking , his whole crooked body trembling , as he leaned forward and reached out along the length of the long corpse until he felt the wet blood on the stones . He laid his bit of cloth there , patting it , until he felt it moisten under his fingertips . Then he drew back and rolled it into a spill and quickly thrust it down his neck , beneath his cloak . There was a sound behind him of sandaled feet on the stone pavement . The monks came forward now , black-cowled and silent , and with wide arms drove the people from the church . Walter went with the others , crowding out the cloister door , and the monks closed and bolted it behind them . Inside they turned upon the body of the slain and stood about it like dark birds , watching it , not quite entering the light , and waited . Dead by the sword he lay , within the sanctuary of the church , victim of murderers who might return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness . Benedict the sub-prior came forward in the light . The duty fell on him , since Prior Odo was away . His face looked young  | and white as chalk , but when he spoke they did not question but went to and fro at his direction : the sacristan to the high altar to remove the Blessed Sacrament because the church was desecrated now , two more to grope down the dark stairway to the crypt to find a bier , Brother Ernold to the sacristy for a container , others to bring benches from the nave to place about the body to protect it . Brother Benedict himself bent down and took the sacred pallium from around the neck and folded it and put it to one side so that it might be given to the poor . The Host was carried from the church , the hand-bier placed beside the corpse , the benches set about it . Ernold came from the sacristy , bearing a silver basin in his arms , and laid it on the floor beside the broken head . Then many hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blood and brains from off the floor and spilled them in the bowl . Gilfridus the infirmarian came walking swiftly , following Osbert , into that little squared-off place of death . He was a doctor , and with a doctor 's face , unmoved , he looked down on the corpse . Then he pushed the others back and sat down on the floor and lifted the mutilated head into his lap . With thread and needle , swiftly , expertly , he sewed the severed scalp back into place . All was done in silence except for Benedict 's soft words directing them and now and then a sibilant escaping from their lips at prayer . The darkness ringing them breathed with the I Breath of many others , standing away , observing . But when they lifted up the corpse , now straight and orderly , to place it on the bier , the monks cried out . For underneath it , now revealed , where it had been hidden by the fur-lined robe , there lay the broken blade , all blood-stained , of a sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church . And the monks looked from eye to eye and back again upon the body and the sword . This man before them , dead , their archbishop , t heir leader and their spiritual father  --  what was he now ? A martyr as the common people thought ? Killed in the cause of God : nul Church and to be reverenced ? Or was he merely traitor to the king , he who deserted them for six long years , killed in a brawl of his own instigating ? De Broc had shouted in the darkness when he left , he would return and feed the body to the pigs . Where should they hide it ?  | They looked at Benedict . His eyes were blank in his white face . A voice , a monk 's , spoke from the darkness , phrasing the doubt that gathered in their minds : " He is no martyr ; he is justly served . " They stood in silence , no one replied , until an old man walked into the pool of light : Robert of Merton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His gentle , withered face was calm , abstracted , as though he had just left a peaceful place and still remembered it , but his eyes were shadowed when they looked down at his friend . Then he looked up at all their faces , doubtridden and dark-socketed under the wavering light , and spoke as teacher to a group of novices : " Do you see glory and yet not perceive it ? ' Words from the office for the dead . Robert had found the ancient comfort in them once again as he knelt beside the little altar of St. Benedict and prayed that even now he might accept the will of God  --  even at this time , while the Devil 's argument within the inner room , the confrontation by the pillar in the church , the deathblows and the final dying words still echoed in his ears . Brother Benedict , who was a man to sift and test all words , said , " Show us the glory . " " There is one glory of the sun , another glory of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words of Paul , " And yet another glory of the stars , for one star differs from another in its glory . ' Come , take him up , and I will show you glory here . " Four monks bent down and took the handles of the bier . They followed Robert where he led them , up the steps and to the choir , leaving the broken sword , the costly fur-lined cloak , the folded pallium behind them on the bloody stones . " Bring candles , " Robert said , " and place him here before the altar where we may honor him . " They did as they were told , and knelt each one in his accustomed place as for a service . Then Prior Robert stooped before the body of his friend . He thrust his hand into the opening of the tunic and pulled forth a fold of cloth from that still breast , the rough and spiky cloth of a hair shirt . The dark , stained texture stood up stiffly in his fist and from its folds black specks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a proof . A monk said , " He was a saint indeed ; we knew it not ! " Robert said nothing , holding the cold cloth in his hand . He knew , he sometimes glimpsed , what made a saint . He knew the many ways that men sought God , the many ways they failed , their sins , and he knew Thomas . " But if we seek thee , Lord , have we not found thee ? " he said in his heart . " And may I not do this , for friendship , out of love ? " He nodded as they watched his face , his eyes . And they were swayed . Their voices rose in lamentation for the dead , in praise of this new martyr of the Church . Walter the moneyer spoke to no one as he took the dark streets home . The soldiers of de Broc still loitered at Burgate , a mounted guard stood in the palace courtyard , and he was forced to make his way , hiding and darting , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long way round , almost to Newingate , and up the Highstreet to the corner . As he ran he clutched the clothing at his breast , over the little roll of bloody rag beneath . The storm was almost over ; only a little rain fell now . And when he turned the corner into Pillory Lane he looked up once , toward Christchurch , and saw the sky flush pink , then slowly deepen to a martyr 's red , before he scurried to his door . He pushed through it and stumbled in the darkness to the corner where his wife lay rigid , staring her demon down . There he bent over her , still panting , fumbling for the holy relic in his breast . On the very night of the murder a woman of Canterbury , Hawisa by name , who for three years had suffered from a nightly suffocation and oppression by a demon , was brought a piece of clothing dipped in the archbishop 's blood . On seeing it she cried out that it should be boiled and that the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done she was delivered of her demon and she rose up praising God and His new martyr of the Church , St. Thomas . Thus was the first of all St. Thomas ' miracles worked that first night , with all the children looking on , in a poor craftsman 's house in Canterbury .  | PRIL HAD COME with its sweet showers and the little birds sang loudly , for the dawn was clear . The earth smelled of the stirring root , the thawing clod . And up above , the turrets of the tall cathedral church stood out as black as twigs against a pale green sky . Mary the nun of Barking made her way along the pebbled paths and high-walled walks , skirting the gleam of puddles , from the guest hall out beyond the Larder gate , past the monastic buildings , into the dark-roofed cloister . The rumbling voices of the monks at Lauds came from the chapter house  --  a drone , a monotone , for there could be no song or music while the church lay desecrate . She passed them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty church . There , at the pillar whose white rounded trunk rose ghostly in the darkness , had her brother suffered death . A glow of light beyond the transept showed her the stairway to the crypt . Softly she walked , her long lids covering her eyes , down the stone steps and under the low vaulting where the candles by the tomb , unwavering in the silent air , threw vaultshaped shadows on the painted walls . The tomb was a gray marble coffin , low and long . The candles , of the finest wax , were golden-white , almost transparent , thick as a man 's thigh , and stood tall in their wrought holders , tall as the thin and upright figure of the nun . They cast a pure light on the marble slab and on the covered chalice and the reliquary that had been placed on it : the cup that held the dried flakes of her brother 's blood , the bowl that held his brains . The old nun crossed herself . No one was there ; Brother Benedict and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lauds . She knelt . " In the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost ... "  | Mary of Barking , sister of Thomas , had not known her brother very well . They had been parted when they were still children and she had gone off full of expectations , riding pillion close behind her father 's back , peering to see the wonders of the London streets as they rode all across the town and through the peaceful countryside to Barking Abbey where she had had her schooling and , in time , became a nun . She had been forty years at Barking . Forty years . And not yet abbess , for the old abbess lived on , lingering . And then she had been wrenched from all she knew and all she hoped for when her brother the archbishop had fled England and defied the king , and all his relatives and friends had been plucked from their homes and sent in exile after him . Now he was dead , some said a martyr 's death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She prayed for him , the brother whom she hardly knew : his soul 's ascent ; the growing glory of his name in which already miracles were worked ; the downfall of his enemies ; the sanction of the pope to call him saint , as many , in their eagerness , already did ; for justice for herself who for her brother had borne exile cheerfully and but for him might well be abbess now , because of him should be . She was already fifty-six years old , all but the first ten of them spent in cloister and in the service of the Church , all but the last six serving Barking ... . The stones grew very hard beneath her knees , accustomed as she was to kneel , and the cold of the empty church , the towers of stone above her , pressed down and engulfed her , seeped through the many layers of her habit till her body shook . She rose and left the crypt and went to seek the comfort of a friend . She had arrived at Christchurch only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might assist her in the promotion that she longed for . But Odo , fearful of the king 's wrath , had withdrawn from Canterbury even before the murder , and while the king 's men prowled the countryside snarling like wild dogs when the martyr 's name was glorified , would not return . She had tried Brother Benedict , who was sub-prior now , but Benedict 's dark penetrating gaze lacked understanding . Then she had found one who did not judge , her brother 's friend and old confessor , Robert , Prior of Merton .  | She went to meet him now , in the guest hall garden where they always met just after Prime before they broke their fast . She saw him coming through the garden door , a small man , not over dean , with muddy sandals and the pelisse under his mantle spotted and wrinkled with long wear . Nevertheless , he walked serenely and his gnomelike face , tilted a little sideways , seemed to greet the morning as a friend . He held his head cocked thus because he always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to God continually . And his ear waited with delight to catch the answer . Mary did not smile but offered him her thin , cold hands as he approached . " Benedicite , " he said cheerfully , and they went to sit upon the bench that had been placed where the first morning sun would fall . Mary sat straight-backed with her knees together and her hands clasped tightly under the long sleeves of her habit . But in the dark , long-lidded eyes that searched his face there was a hidden warmth . " What is the news today , dear friend ? " she asked . " Are there more miracles ? The people come ? " Prior Robert , knowing the reason , the ambition , behind her question , felt impatience twinge within him but with the help of God 's word in his ear he warned himself : Judge not . " Yes , " he said , smiling to encourage her . " They come . " " The humble people come , " said Mary . " Soon the world will come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will kneel before him as I knelt this morning ! " Still Robert smiled , although his eyes had wandered off to where the cool , transparent morning air was flooding light upon the apple twigs . " The Archbishop of York shall come himself to beg his mercy , " Mary said . Then her face lighted . " They tell me that already Bishop Foliot suffers the torments of disease . " Robert brought his eyes to hers once more . " Let us not hope evil for one another , " he reminded her . Mary was rebuked . " I loved my brother ; therefore I hate his enemies , " she said . " You loved your brother , and I loved him too . And yet we have not spoken of him , " Robert said .  | Mary was startled . " But I speak of him ! Often . Always , since I have come ! " " Of the martyr , yes . Of the archbishop sometimes . Of what you want for him and for yourself . Not of the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words . " Tell me of Thomas as you knew him . It will comfort me . " " As I knew him , " Mary said . She paused in thought . " I knew him there at Pontigny when I was exiled and I came to show myself to him before I went to St. Remi . You were there . You saw how I came smiling , not as the others did . " " But you are speaking of yourself ! " the prior said . " I thought that we might speak of Thomas . " Mary 's hand went up across her eyes . " You ask a great deal , Prior Robert . It is a long time since I have finished with remembering . . . . " Then with an effort she said , " He came to Barking once , when he was the king 's chancellor . " " Ah ? " " Yes , he came once . . . Splendid he was , and with a noble train of men . He honored us greatly . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while all the great lords stood apart and the abbess left us to speak of old times together , just we two .. . " He was kind and merry , remembering all , everything , between us . " Mary was not aware her face had softened as she spoke , but Prior Robert saw . " We were very close as children , long ago . " " You played as children in your father 's house ? " " Aye , I remember , long ago . The clays were golden then . . " This I remember , " and she turned to him , her face as young as he had ever seen it , " it was Michaelmas , oh many years ago . The fires were new-lit for winter on that day . And our father sat in the hall with his guests and we were in the solar off behind . Ah , Michaelmas . . . There would have been a folkmoot at that season , and extra guests , though I think my father was not alderman that year . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , understand . It was lit for sport because it was the time of year for it . But it was warm as I recall . Oh , I recall it now . That was the year the winter came so late and great gray spiders sat their webs in the garden long past their time .  | " We were in the solar , Thomas and I , and Roheise in the crib , a baby still . And Thomas was all naked . . . because it was so warm , at Michaelmas . We laughed about it , and he ran and jumped about and kicked the rushes up and overturned the pot . Oh how we laughed ! " She smiled and drew a breath . " He could not have been more than three or four , " she said . " And I was six or seven . . . . Mary stopped talking with the smile still on her face , but she was not aware of it , nor quite aware when she began to speak again . " Mother came into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . She was not angry . Mother never scolded . But she told Thomas to remember that he was a man and to repent if ever he did wrong and ask Our Lady 's help . " Robert smiled . " And I must tell you , " she went on , " what more my mother did . She took up Thomas from his knees and set him on her lap and told us of a dream she had when Thomas was a tiny child , only a few days old and newly baptized . She dreamed she saw a beautiful new cloth of gold folded on the cradle where he slept . She said she looked on it and loved it and had a longing to see all of it . She told Alfleda ... " The nun paused . " That was the maid who cared for us , we children , when we were small . Alfleda . " She caught her breath . " I had forgotten her . " She sat still , remembering a moment . Then she continued . " My mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloth ; I long to see how big and fair it is . Alfleda took it , but she said : Madam , there is no room within the chamber . Try again , I said , Go into the hall where there is ample space . And again she answered me : The hall will not hold all of it . Then go we to the garden , go we to the open fields ! I cried . At that a voice spoke to me like the tolling of a bell . No use to try , it said . The cloth is broader than all England . ' " My mother 's voice broke when she said this and I looked and saw that tears were on her cheeks . And seeing them Thomas wept too , although  --  as I remember  --  I did not . I was young then , in years and understanding . Six or seven . And Thomas that much younger . I think he only wept to see my mother 's face . Such things as dreams were well beyond him yet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mind . This much she could remember of her brother : how he had lived his baby years in London , coddled , made much of , only son of a prosperous Norman merchant , lord of his sisters in the solar , petted by the maid Alfleda and fed by her on tales of ancient Saxon times , taught by his mother to love charity .. . " My mother used to weigh him , when he was an infant , against the weight of folded garments or loaves of bread or other things to give to the poor , " she told the prior . She could remember this because she had been told of it , though she could never quite recall the scene herself . This she knew best , that she had loved her little brother . But they had parted early . She did not remember  --  she had never known  --  the workings of his fate , the play of circumstance on character , that brought the little naked shouting boy she loved so well , through all the winding years , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How long was it since the old nun had thought of Cheapside and her father 's house and of her brother Tom ? She thought now , tucking her thin hands in the wide wool sleeves , slumping a little on the narrow bench , of how it was when all the world was full of boys and men . She thought how cold the men 's cloaks were when they came in from out of doors in winter and how they smelled of horses when their cloaks dried out . And she remembered suddenly  --  a picture  --  Thomas ' face : the dark eyes snapping and the thick hair falling on his forehead and around his ears , the skin almost transparent with the cold , the nose and cheeks stung red , and how he brought the cold of frost and winter skies into the solar and how he smiled and said  --  she heard the voice , a boy 's voice , very sweet  --  that he had seen a man who could work magic , and , " God does n't live in St. Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six or seven he must have been  --  and trying to teach her and Alfleda something they did n't know . " He lives outside , near Smoothfield . " " Who told you ? " That was her own voice . " The magic man . "  | Thomas had been that afternoon  --  soon after Christmas it was , in the winter of llzs  --  out to the smooth field where in winter boys and men went skating on the frozen horse pond and where on Holy Days , sometimes , they set the dogs to fighting bears . He had gone with his father and two guests , two brothers , Churchmen from Boulogne , Baldwin and Eustace , who were in London for the first time . Churchmen like these , and secular lords as well , were frequent visitors at his father 's house . Gilbert Becket 's hall was warns and welcoming , the life of London flowing in and out of it , and guests from far away were always coming . They made the merchant 's house their stopping place in London because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and because good Norman French was always spoken there . They did not care that their host 's rank was lower than their own , that he could claim no title or high family connections . Gilbert was a Norman like themselves , his wife Roheise a Norman too , and both were highly skilled in hospitality . Gilbert planned a small diversion for his guests that winter afternoon and Thomas , for the first time , was allowed to come along . They rode through Cheapside and out Newgate , Thomas on the pillion seat behind his father , into the ward of Farringdon Without . They left their horses on the slope above the horse pond and walked down to see the skaters . Boys and even men had tied shin bones of animals to their shoes and pushed themselves with poles until they skimmed and looped and darted swift as birds . Thomas wondered at them . This was something new to see ! He was delighted ; so were the Norman visitors . Such running on the ice was new to them as well . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town as London for good sport , " he said . He pushed up , shouldering his way into the crowd that stood around the pond to watch , wanting to give his guests a better view . Most of the men there glanced around and saw that they were Churchmen and made room , but one among them stood his ground . " Step on your own feet , noble lord , " he growled . Baldwin and Eustace opened their eyes wide at this . They did not understand the English but they heard the tone . Gilbert ,  | however , was at home with every kind of man . " Aye , so I will , master porcupine , " he said easily , and stepped beside him . He also spoke in English , badly accented but understandable . Baldwin said testily , in French , " I do think , Gilbert Becket , you allow too much among your English peasantry . " " Yes , yes , perhaps I do , " said Gilbert . " But this fellow is an outlander , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in London . " The man turned once again and scowled at them . " I hope not to , " said Baldwin sourly . " Let us move on . " They turned away and Gilbert , taking Baldwin 's elbow , told him earnestly , " The men of London are not like other men . Here are we all brothers , Norman and English , side by side , all friendly . " " Is it so ? " said Baldwin , unbelieving . " Oh yes , we are together at our husting meetings and together in our sport . And as we live like this the feeling grows among us that we are one . Take my son Thomas here ... " Thomas , walking by Eustace just behind his father , pricked up his ears . " Tended by a Saxon maid and speaking her tongue with her , " said Gilbert . " Learning his catechism from the English priest across the street .... " Eustace spoke for the first time . " Surely you will not let him grow up so ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the worth of my own son , " said Gilbert . " His French is pure , and he shall be sent to school to learn his Latin in a few years . We have our learned men here , also . Indeed , my lords , when you have come to know our city you will not be astonished at anything you see . London is older than Rome , you know , being founded in the ancient times by Brutus . And Londoners are ranked as barons  --  all men of standing , that is  --  by our ancient charter . Besides , our city is the home of every great lord in the land , you might say , since they live here as citizens while they attend the king when he holds court at Westminster . " Baldwin smiled at his host 's earnestness . " You Londoners are proud , I 'll grant you . " But then he looked around him somewhat impatiently . His feet were growing cold . " There is a church , " said Gilbert hastily , " that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk faster . It will warm us.  | Then we can go home . There is a marvelous story connected with this church  --  just being built it is . Come , you will see . " They left the pond and walked back toward the city walls and soon , ahead of them , they saw the church  --  a shell , only the first stones in their places , rising from the frosty meadow , gleaming against the low gray sky . It was to be the priory church of a great house of Augustinian Canons and the architects and builders had been at work on it three years . Just now , this bitter afternoon , the masons had deserted it and it stood empty , silent , amid the blocks of stone , the hand carts and the wagons left on the frozen mud . Beyond its white stone arches and curving apse they could see smoke that rose up from a row of low thatched dormitories and , at a little distance toward the city , the hospital for the poor sick of London which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Bartholomew . " The canon tells me , " Gilbert said , " that he will build a fair large house of stone for his hospital as well  --  all in good time . " A man came toward them , thin and graceful in his canon 's cloak , and with a long twisted face beneath his wide soft hat . " There is Canon Rahere coming now , " Gilbert murmured , and explained to Baldwin that the stranger was a courtier of the king as well as a canon of St. Paul 's Cathedral , " and now the founder of this priory , a most important man .... " He raised his voice . " God be with you and your noble work , my lord . " Rahere recognized the merchant Gilbert , once an alderman and thus familiar to him at the hustings , and greeted him with courtly affability , welcoming the visitors , when Gilbert had presented them , to London and to St. Bartholomew 's . " Work has stopped , as you can see , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ring of chisels on the stones again . And meanwhile , I " ? his face changed and the twisted mouth lifted a notch ? " I can not bear to leave it even for that moment . " " There is a marvelous story my lord Rahere tells , " Gilbert said to his guests , " concerning this great church . " The canon broke in . " There are many marvels in the world which men will tell  --  but not so sure of proof as mine ! "  | Gilbert had heard the story many times but he was eager to impress his guests . " I had hoped , my lord , that you might show us .... " Yes ? " said Rahere quickly . " Well , indeed , I do have here . . . . " He felt with one long hand into the furred sleeve of his cloak . But as he bent his head his glance brushed Thomas ' solemn upturned face . He drew his hand forth empty , slowly opening the palm as though to study it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeve . Again it came forth empty . He tried again , more quickly , and his hands flashed here and there , until , at last , he held out both hands to Thomas with the palms up , empty , and the sleeves pulled back . And there before their eyes , it seemed , a little parchment roll appeared in the right hand . Thomas blushed red , not knowing whether he should laugh . The strange man sighed . " The king was wont to laugh at my small tricks , " he said . " Even my jests amused him sometimes . Now my antics can not bring a smile even to the face of a small child ! " He spoke in a lugubrious voice , and yet his face was no more solemn than before . Gilbert laughed aloud . Rahere looked up at him . " Aye , " he said . " These are the tricks of the hand and the eye . You see they cling to me like a tiresome mistress . What have they to do with the marvels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is this your son ? " he asked . " This is my son Thomas , " Gilbert said formally , with pride . Thomas bowed as he was taught to do , one foot behind the other . The canon bent and lifted him and sat him on the nearest stone . " Now , Thomas , I shall tell you something you can believe , " he said in a changed quiet voice . Thomas felt this curious man was cold , a little frightening , and yet it warmed him to be spoken to like this . The men moved closer and Rahere related to them how , on the wreck of the White Ship these five years past and the great sorrow that had fallen on the court with the drowning of the king 's son and heir  --  and with him many a flower of the court and dear friend also  --  he had vowed to go on a pilgrimage to please the king . " You know the court . . . " He flattered Gilbert , for the mer- chant had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striving to please one man . And I was likewise striving . " The mouth twitched . And thus , to please the king , the courtier had taken staff in hand and made the journey down toward Rome . But in that foul marshy region round about Tre Fontane the pestilence had taken him and he lay close to death for many months . And in his pain and fear he vowed , should God spare him , to build a hospital to help the poor of his great native city . " It was the vow of a man in fear , " he said . " Yet it was heard in heaven , for as I hung there between life and death a marvelous vision was vouchsafed me : I woke from fever and I saw a beast approaching me , a strong and terrible beast , a lion of great size , with eight clawed feet and wings like eagles ' wings . He seized me in his talons and he took me up , out of my chamber , bore me through the air until we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there I felt it was the beast 's intent to loose me . Looking down I saw a chasm , black and yawning , an unfathomable pit . My heart within my breast turned cold with mortal fear and I cried out for mercy . " Then , even as the echo of my screams rang out among the stars , the figure of a man appeared beside me  --  a man but larger than a man , noble beyond describing , and clothed in gold . " He spoke : I am Bartholomew , Apostle of Jesus Christ , come to succor thee in thine anguish . ' And he stretched out his hand to me and I was saved . " So was my vow solemnized . And in my gratitude I swore to build a church , as well as found my hospital , to glorify his name . " He looked at Thomas . " Thus you see a silly man , changed by God . " Thomas stared silently into the long wry face . " I have here , " Rahere looked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessing his church . " He took the little roll which he still carried in his hand and opened it upon the stone , pressing it flat . The others came up close to look . Gilbert could not read it but the Churchmen could . The world grew silent all about them as they bent . The little cries of men came floating to them from the horse pond down  | below . Then Rahere spoke the words for Thomas and his father . He did not need to read them , they were written on his heart : " This spiritual house Almighty God shall inhabit , and hallow it , and glorify it ; and His eyes shall be opened and His ears intending on this house night and day ; and the asker in it shall receive , the seeker shall find , the ringer or knocker shall enter . Truly every soul converted , penitent of his sins and in this house praying , in gracious heaven shall be heard . The seeker with perfect heart , from whatsoever tribulation , without doubt he shall find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and faded in the air , and all were silent until Baldwin spoke . " Amen , " he said . Rahere straightened and put the little scroll away . " These are the words as St. Bartholomew spoke them , " he said at last . " I read them to you because I know that you might doubt my story if I did not give you more proof than my own poor story telling . " But hear me speak , and listen with your hearts and understanding . Do I speak such words as you have heard just now ? No , " a little smile came to the crooked mouth . " I speak with the tongue of a courtier . Surely , what you have just heard  --  that was the voice of a saint who lives with God . " In the narrow forecourt of the house in Cheapside the men dismounted and Thomas was lifted from his father 's horse . He saw his mother standing in the doorway , a mantle round her shoulders , and ran to her while the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to her , under the cloak , while she greeted them . Then as the Churchmen climbed the wooden stairway to the hall she touched her husband 's arm and drew him into the little chamber underneath the stairs . " Gilbert , we have a noble guest , " she whispered . " The Baron Richer l'Aigle and his men arrived not half an hour ago . I have made them welcome as I could . " " Good . " Gilbert clapped his hands together . A guest was always welcome in his hall , and if he be a person of so high a standing as Lord Richer so much the better . " Have you anything for supper that will please him ? "  | " I sent Ebert to the cookshop , having so short a time for preparation . " " Good , " Gilbert repeated , full of gusto . " What will he bring ? " " A chicken boiled with marrow bone , " his wife said , " a meat pie , and the salt-beef seasoned as you like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Gilbert kissed her quickly and started up the stairs . Halfway he halted and leaned down to them . " Remind Ebert on his return , " he said , " the baron likes the red wine of Touraine . " Then he looked fondly for a moment at the faces of his wife and son . " Thomas behaved well today , " he said and disappeared . Thomas loved the praise . His mother , too , was pleased . " So you have been a good boy helping to entertain your father 's guests . That makes me happy . " And she took his hand and led him up the stairs . The old familiar hall was wane , buzzing with people , flickering with light . All the candles had been lit and on the hearth the fire burned smoothly , eating at the logs . What smoke there was had risen to the rafters and hung high . The sudden warmth made Thomas very sleepy . He saw Lord Richer in the chair and father bending over him . . . Affleda in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder , and a jug in her other hand . . . the starling hopping in his cage ... Mary standing with one foot on the other by the screen that shut the solar off . . . and many other things . But all were hazy . All the movement and the buzz of talk confused him and he blinked . " Go into the solar and lie down , " his mother said , amused to see him sleeping on his feet . He started forward , staggering on heavy legs across the hall , and Mary turned and followed him into the darkness of the little family room . " What was it like ? " she asked . " What happened ? " But Thomas could not say . His mind was crowded with the sights and sounds of all that he had seen that day  --  too many , far too many , to share with his sister . " Nothing , " he said . " I know where God lives . Out near Smoothfield where the big stones are . " " Who told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had no more to tell her . Already life , experience , had come between them . And in the next fall Mary left the busy house on West Cheap never to return , never to know her little brother more . " The latest is , the Archbishop of York has been suspended from the Church for his part in the murder . " William Fitzstephen 's ruddy , freckled face was eager as a boy 's as he sat in the garden talking to the nun , for like a magpie he gathered bits of news and loved to show them off . He was a clerk ; he had been a deacon and a judge for Thomas when he was archbishop . But more than that he was a man who loved to be where things were going on and to be first to tell the world of them . He had found Thomas ' sister an eager listener . She leaned forward . " And the other English bishops ? " she inquired . " The Bishop of London ? " " I heard only of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for he was a man who loved the color of the news more than the bare facts , and added , " But it is said in Rome His Holiness the Pope will excommunicate them all . On Maundy Thursday this will take place . . . . " " What of the king ? " " The king ? Well , I believe I told you that the Archbishop of Sens has put his lands in Normandy under an interdict .... " Mary nodded . " And that he sent a letter to the pope asking that the king be excommunicated too ? " " Yes , yes . What says His Holiness ? " " No word as yet . But they say he will not see the deputies the king has sent to plead his cause . They say he can not even bear to hear King Henry 's name . " Mary put her own long hands beside the coif over her ears as though she , like the pope , could not endure that name , and William , unkindly moved , said drily : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harshly with the king . The Bishop of Rouen has gone to Rome to plead for him . Some say he is not guilty and that he deals too harshly with himself already . You know how long and  | hard he wept to hear of Thomas ' death . I heard he would take nothing but a little almond milk for three days afterward . And for that long time  --  forty days it was  --  he would do nothing for the affairs of state or in his own defense . . . . " " And now he sends to Rome to bribe the cardinals ! " Mary broke in . Fitzstephen stopped . " Of course . You may be right . You must be right , madame . " They sat in silence , Fitzstephen with his head bowed , showing his graying hair and freckled tonsure , until he had another thought . " Oh , I have better news , " he said . " More miracles are worked ! I have just come , only this morning , from the moneysmithy .... " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " Ever more miracles . Does the pope sanction them ? Are we now free to pray to Thomas as one sanctified ? " " Not yet , Dame Mary , " William said . " No word has come . It is not lawful ; you know the pope 's decree . We may not reverence a man as saint  --  no matter how many miracles are done by him  --  without the sanction of the Curia . " " And so we wait , and wait , " said Mary bitterly . " And Brother Roger told me some of the monks are frightened lest the martyr grow impatient . Well , " she sighed . " Well , tell me of your miracles . " William straightened and edged closer . " You know about the money-smithy down in Pillory Lane ? There where the woman was delivered of her demon ? People come there now to beg a drop of their miraculous water for their ills . I was there this morning . There was a boy who had a thorn implanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then a man came in . . .. " In Pillory Lane the house was in an uproar , people coming there from every part of town to borrow just a little of the water with the martyr 's blood , or merely to step up and peer into it ( they kept it in the pot where it was boiled ) or to stare at the wife , Hawisa , whose demon had been driven off by it . She lay in bed . The smaller children played around her on the sheepskin covering . The neighbors and the visitors stooped by the fire or sat on the stools around the table in the center of the room  --  for  | that was all the house was , just one long room with a stone pillar to support the roof  --  and when there were no newcomers to prick their interest the grandmother , Wulviva of Hortone , retold the story of her daughter 's miracle . This day the clerk Fitzstephen from the archbishop 's palace was a visitor and she retold the tale for him . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a sort of shining silence as though he did not know he was afflicted ( he was dumb ) , and in another sat the old man Elured Porre , the patriarch , he who had been a minter ever since the old King Henry 's reign . He was the only one who knew the martyr in his lifetime , but he was old now , and no one listened to him when he spoke . " I knew the archbishop , of course , " he said . " A tall man . " No one listened . " I said to him , Give me a penny . I am a beggar . ' And he laughed at me . " Elured laughed soundlessly , closing his eyes . No one took any notice of him . Who would have thought this withered old man propped on his stool in the corner had once ruled the household with a cutting tongue and that his slightly shaking hands once minted better pennies than any other moneyer in Canterbury , or in London either , for that matter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wash my feet . ' Ayho , we laughed at that ! " That was a miracle if you want one . I struck a penny . . . no , that was another time . This time I thought , I 'll put a knife into your back , scoundrel , taking a man 's work from him ! ' Then when we laughed I dropped the knife . I did n't have a knife . I would have dropped it if I had had one . That was a man . I liked that man . . . . No one took any notice of him . They were grouped around Wulviva as she went on with her story of the demon and their miraculous water and they hung upon her words , watched her huge gestures and her piercing eyes that went their separate ways  --  for never since her birth had the two looked at the same spot together  --  and listened to her strong compelling voice . The father of the house , the hunchback Walter , came and went , a thin smile on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when someone new came through the little forecourt  | where the hand cart stood beside the smithy door . His boy Viel followed after him and it was he who saw his uncle coming ? not his silent uncle , Almon , who lived with them , but his grandmother 's cousin who lived in Certeham , Uncle Eilward , whom his father laughed at because he was so simple . He came across the forecourt with his face aglow and his arms waving out before him and then stood inside the doorway smiling at them all . Wulviva was the first to speak , for she was always first to smell a miracle . " Another miracle ? " she called out , turning her heavy body from the table where she sat . Eilward lunged forward and the neighbors scraped their stools as they rose up and pushed one out for him . " A miracle ! " Eilward repeated , smiling up into the faces that surrounded him . " Another miracle . To me ! " He was so pleased it brought tears to his eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell us how it happened , " he said crisply . " One , two , three . Exactly how it was . And no one else must talk . " He looked around him warningly . They waited until Eilward could collect himself . He thought a long time , smiling happily . At last he said , " It happened in the night . I had pain , a pain so terrible I thought I had gone mad . " " Where ? " asked Fitzstephen . He wanted to know everything , exactly as it was , for he was keeping record of all the miracles he heard . " Where ? " echoed Eilward , " why in my house of course . " " The pain , the pain , " Fitzstephen said impatiently . " Oh , in my jaw , I aw , " said Eilward , opening his mouth . There was a silence while Eilward 's mouth hung open and he pointed in it to show them where the pain had been . " And then ? " Fitzstephen prodded : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of the night you know . And that is when I saw the vision . A very tall man wearing a bright scarf .... " " A miracle ! " Wulviva shouted . " Wait , wait , I have not finished , " Eilward objected . " What did he look like , this tall man ? " Fitzstephen asked .  | " He was very tall , " Eilward said thoughtfully . " And he wore a bright scarf . " " Yes , tall , you told us that . But what about the face ? Was there anything on the face that you remember ? " Fitzstephen said . " Yes , " Eilward was eager to agree . " Yes , something on the face . " " What ? " " What ? " " What on the face ? Any blood ? Was there blood across the face ? " " Yes , blood , " he nodded , watching Fitzstephen closely . " Blood on . . . " His eyes were fastened to Fitzstephen and his mouth hung slack . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making marks across his own broad freckled face . " Yes , blood on the forehead . And ? Where else ? " " Yes , on his cheek . Yes , on the eyebrow . . . right across your nose . . . to the other cheek ? " Fitzstephen straightened up . He looked around from face to face . " It is amazing , " he said somberly . " Incredible . Even so was our lord Thomas in his death , a streak of blood across his face . I saw it . And even so has he been seen by all who have had visions of him since his death ! " Eilward smiled broadly , basking , but once again Wulviva called attention to herself . " I said it was a miracle ! " she cried . " Wait ! There you go again ! " Eilward said angrily . " I have n't told you what the vision said ! " They turned to him once more . " What did he say ? " " First I said , " Eilward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw him , for he frightened me : Lord , who are you ? ' I said . ? ' lien he said , I am a clerk of Canterbury who was very close to the archbishop who was dead but lives . " But lives ! " Wulviva cried . " But I said , " Eilward went on stubbornly , " ' Do not say that to anyone . It is not safe . ' And then he said  --  here is the part I best remember ? It is for them , my enemies , to tremble , not for n ie. See , I have here a letter from my lord the Pope saying that all the murderers shall suffer terribly and that de Broc shall go straight to the pit of hell . ' And then he waved the scarf .... "  | " It was his pallium , " Fitzstephen put in quickly . " And then he waved the scarf , " Eilward repeated doggedly . " It was the letter from the pope you know , and brushed my cheek with it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no more pain . I woke up and the pain was gone ! " He smiled , for he had finished , and because the pain was gone . This was the latest miracle Fitzstephen told to Mary . Its sequel was a tragedy that he had not yet learned . For after Eilward had told all the neighbors of his cure and then retold it to the monks at Christchurch , he had set off for Certeham with only Almon Drop the dumb man to accompany him . Thus only Almon knew , and could not tell , how when they had approached the bridge he saw the horsemen there and knew them to be soldiers of de Broc and ran and hid himself and from his hiding place heard the rough questions and the voice of Eilward , full of his wonder , telling the story of his vision and his cure by the tall figure with the streak of blood across his face . " Was it like this ? " he heard the soldiers ask . " A stroke like this ? A gash ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' heavy feet upon the planks , the sound of blows , the screams . And then the wheeling of the horses and the words , " He 's dead . Let 's go . " The clatter on the bridge and after that the galloping , dying away . Almon waited for the dark to bring his cousin home , dragging the body with its head split open . But he had not tongue to tell , nor skill to write , what he had seen and heard .  | JUST BEFORE EASTER of 1171 , Prior Odo felt the time was ripe for his return to Canterbury . News of the miracles done in the dead archbishop 's name had come to him not only from Christchurch  --  Benedict sent word of those by every messenger  --  but far afield in England and from abroad as well . Not only were the poor and ignorant folk of Canterbury and its villages clamoring to tell the world about their miracles ( no one but Benedict and some of the lesser monks would give much credence to the hysteria of common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Sussex knight , hearing that miracles were worked , had prayed to the archbishop to regain her failing sight and had been cured . All over England such things happened , and as far away as in Jerusalem a holy monk who died on that same day the archbishop was murdered came  --  in a vision  --  to the abbot of his house and said that Thomas had been raised to equal rank in heaven with St. Peter himself . This last had been relayed to Odo by the Archbishop of Sens . Thus , though the pope had not yet spoken , he felt it would he safe to venerate the martyr and let the pilgrims come to do him honor at his tomb . IIe returned , then , to take up his duties in the great monastic house of Christchurch , early in Holy Week . He found that all that Benedict had written him was true . In Canterbury men talked of little else but miracles , and daily pilgrims begged to be admitted to the tomb . It did not take the urgings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuade him that this must be done . The time was ripe , and the decision was not so much his to make as his to acquiesce to . " Good Friday , then , " he said to Benedict 's unspoken question . ' ' Good Friday they shall he admitted  --  under your guidance . " The word was his to give ; he gave it . Nevertheless he did not  | want it said , just yet , that he had been there with them in the crypt . Better to wait and see . " Under your guidance , " he repeated . " Only a few . The better dressed among them . " He turned away . " We do not want the mob . " Good Friday came , and Benedict spoke to the guard beside the gate and both together they peered through to see the pilgrims pressing close against the other side . One might have thought them foolish to crowd one another so , when all the rush market lay empty at their backs , but Benedict knew , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forays into the city , and instead they marveled that they had the courage to stand waiting there at all . " Their faith has brought them and will protect them , " the monk said solemnly . He put his face up to the crack again . Right in front of him he saw a shabby parish priest  --  one of the rustic kind  --  and next to him , clinging to him like a child to its mother 's skirts , a brawny soldier with a swollen purple face and look of terror in his eyes . He saw a baby in its mother 's arms . Some sort of freak ? Its head was very large . Benedict shifted . Off to one side he saw a leper  --  man or woman he could not tell  --  and next to him a blind man , filthy , with his head bent down as though he searched the ground . He did not see among them any of the well-dressed people Oda specified , but then , his view was limited . He stepped away and told the guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors swung open , thrusting them back as all the pilgrims started forward and surged through together , crowding each other , with their mouths wide open and their eyes alight . Benedict took one shocked look and without speaking turned and hurried back the way that he had come while they pushed at his heels . He heard a man call out behind him in a terrible loud voice , a groan that sounded like the bellow of a bull : " Oh Lord , Oh Holy Thomas , help me now ! " And then the others all began to moan , to wail , to sob , to cry for help . He hurried on , across the palace precincts , into the monastery grounds until he reached the entrance to the church . He thrust the doors apart and strode through , never looking hack . Ile had  | not known that it would be like this . There was no order in this wild procession and it was useless even to try to speak to them . He led them rapidly across the transept and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , astonished and intimidated by the colors on the walls : the patterns studded with bright gold , the soft and feathery wings of painted angels and the flat and staring eyes of saints that watched them from above . But others pushed on past them and when they saw the tomb cried out afresh , so that their sounds re-echoed under the vaulted roof , and some Dell down upon their knees and crawled while others ran ahead before they knelt . Benedict stood back . A young girl paused beside him as though not knowing where to go . " Oh see what stones are here ! " lie heard her chirping voice . Then , as though taking heart , " St. Thomas guard me ! " and " St. Thomas ' name be praised ! " She saw the tomb and trotted forward , still with her little cry . He heard then the loud earnest voice of the broad woman from the money-smithy , she with the water that worked miracles . There was a young man with her , perhaps her son . Benedict heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the holy martyr for your voice again . Ask that your tongue be loosened and explain Your need of it . Tell him you might be parish priest some day ? I 'm sure of it  --  if you could only speak again . Singing 's not necessary . Only the power of speech . " The young man did not seem to listen . His eyes were inward and his face was full of pain . " Ask for the power of French as well , " she raised her voice above the noises in the crypt . " English is not enough . You might as well be dumb if when the deacon comes to Certeham you can not speak in French . Ask him , just ask him , Almon . He has done more for others . " And she went forward and got down ! wavily upon her knees , pulling her son down with her . She clasped her hands and lifted up her broad and earnest face , all t ; listening with sweat . " Oh blessed saint in heaven give my son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her strong spread knees and lifting high her hands : " And French as well . Oh holy martyr , blessed Archbishop , French also ! French as well ! " And so they knelt , the simple minded and the crippled and  | the ill , the demon-ridden  --  all those who suffered and were heavy laden  --  the pilgrims at the tomb . They were as unlike one another , in God 's infinite variety , as one leaf differs from its brother though it hangs from the selfsame branch . These were the members of Prior Odo 's mob . One would have thought , to see them kneeling , rocking , rolling on the floor , to hear their frantic supplications and their weeping and their shouts , this was a madhouse rather than a spiritual house of God . And yet an ear intending on it might discern the overwhelming longing in the heart , the silent prayer : " Oh Lord , have mercy on me . . . that I might receive my sight . " The wailing stopped and all was quiet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . William Fitzstephen had gone on to watch the pilgrims as they passed . " What is it now ? " the nun asked . " Why do their voices fade ? " " They have passed through the cloister , " Prior Robert said . " They have gone into the church . The door is shut . " Within himself , sitting so quietly , he said , " May the Lord hear them in their time of need . " Mary put one hand out and grasped the prior 's wrist . " Prior Robert , " she whispered , her hand tightening on his , " all the world , all the world will bow before my brother ! " Robert waited till her grip relaxed , then took her hand in his . " Dame Mary , " he said softly , " men have bowed to him before . Who is served by this ? What does it signify ? Why , in my youth so long ago I once saw your own father bow before his son . " Mary raised her head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smiling a little , " when Thomas was a little boy , perhaps one year at Merton , and your father came  --  as fathers or their stewards always come to take their boys home after their winter schooling . . . . It was the ordered life , there at the priory ... " He spoke with a mild pleasure for he was a man more certain of eternity than time and did not find its passing painful . . . " And those were peaceful years , when the first Henry sat upon the throne and every man lived safe beside his neighbor . . . . " I had been sent to fetch the scholar Thomas when his father  | came into the prior 's guest room . I knew where to find him for I was young myself then , newly made a canon . And I found him , as I expected , with the other boys in the outer garden searching among the berry vines for the green fruit , like a flight of naughty blackbirds in their robes . " He smiled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his schoolmates , with his blithe face and the dark hair hanging like petals above his brow . And I was moved to love him ; yes , he compelled it of us all , even that early . " Yet I was stunned to see a father go down on his knee to greet his son . The prior was stunned too , for he rebuked him . Foolish man , ' he said . Do you fall down at the feet of your own son ? Surely it is more fit that he do thee that honor ! ' He spoke thus . I well remember it . " " And my father ? " Mary asked . " Your father answered that he knew what he was about . For , ' he said  --  yes , I remember even now his very words ? ' this boy shall be great in the sight of the Lord . ' " He spoke with the voice of prophecy , my own father ! " " Yes , thus he answered , " Prior Robert nodded . " But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our wise old prior taught me this out of his wisdom that I would like to share with you . I le called me back and told me to listen as he spoke . You have seen , ' he said , a man give honor to his son . But was he truly honored by this act ? Honor m son , is like love . Love comes Loin God , and all the love we a - - s but fees sac 11im. ' ' ? so wit onor , oo . he world may sow ; ; ? ut onor is t't Fi ' tI may giv " rur ermT , ' ie s " ai I am distressed to think what thoughts such honoring may put into a young boy 's head . ' Thomas ' heart was light as he rode home from Merton by his father 's side . He , was released from school , and furthermore he kid done well in this first sally into the world outside his home . Learning by rote came quickly to him and his memory was stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so often . He had even earned the canons ' praise . Thus he had found out , at the age of ten , that his place among his peers was at the top .  | He took the knowledge with the humility of childhood ; it was the way things were . And since he was accustomed from his infancy to praise , this fresh acclaim became him well . His father 's greeting of that morning and the prior 's rebuke had made him blush , for he already knew , as certainly did the prior , that to flaunt custom in such a way , reversing the roles of father and son , was dangerous . More than that . He knew what the old prior did not know : his father 's words and actions had come not so much from his convictions as from the teachings of his mother . They had been borrowed from her . He heard again his father 's voice , " This boy shall be great in the eyes of God . " His mother 's words . And then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But he should know , thought Thomas in astonishment , that that was only Mother 's doting , spoken out by Father , clumsily . It was a sobering , almost frightening thing to see his father from the outside in this way and he looked quickly up at him as though to make amends for what he thought . Gilbert rode beside him , in and out of the dappled light that filtered through the leaves , happy with the world and with his boy . Thomas had done well at school , learning his Latin , so the prior said . And now he rode beside his father , grown too big for riding pillion any more , a tall boy , good to look at . Gilbert smiled contentedly . It was eighteen miles to London through the Surrey woodland and Thomas was not used to handling his own mount , so they went slowly , stopping to lunch on the smooth ground where the woods ended on the marshy floodplain of the Thames . Gilbert brought out bread and cheese and pickled herring from his wallet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wide pale sky the marsh birds called and far off , on the quiet river , little men in boats tended the brushwood weirs that stood out from the sandy isle of Battersea . When they had eaten , Gilbert told his son of things at home : Roheise had grown quite big and helped her mother like a little woman , and Agnes toddled after , no longer a baby . At the summer carnival just past , the scholars of St. Paul 's had won their game of ball with great distinction over the other schools . But the men of the cloth-dressers trade had drunk too much and  | caused a brawl over their game ; one man had died of it and many more were injured . The Baron Richer l'Aigle had been a guest at Whitsuntide when he had come to Westminster for the king 's ceremonial wearing-of-the-crown and would return again . He had asked most solicitously after Thomas . This talk of home made Thomas eager to ride on . And when they traveled closer to the city , joining the highroad coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close of day , his heart beat and he looked ahead as though to catch a glimpse of home across the reach . He saw the London Bridge at last and gave a shout and flapped his legs against his horse 's sides . The wooden causeway to the bridge was crowded and on the bridge itself the narrow lane between the stalls was packed , but when their horses stepped into the city on the other bank the crowd dispersed as each man went his own way through the town and now all was familiar : the river smells , the sound of water rushing down the conduits of the sloping streets , of hawkers ' calls and cries of boatmen out upon the river , of barking ( logs and , as they came past Dowgate , the creak of ships that rode the tide just off the landing place . They passed the broad carved frontage of the Flemish merchants ' hall and crossed the little Walbrook bridge into the ward of Vintry before they left the river bank to take the crooked street that led them northward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and Thomas was beside himself . " There 's the eookshop ! " he sang out . His father smiled . " There 's the Jew 's house ! " Their pace was quicker now , and the streets quieter . " There 's St. Mary Colechurch on the corner ! " They rounded it . They were in Cheapside . The Vespers bells were ringing . Mother was at the gate . And they were home . Word came to the merchant 's house that they might expect the Baron Richer l'Aigle late in August as he had some business with the court . This caused a stir among the servants for Lord 11 idler was among the highest nobles of the land and held the 1 I onor of Pevensey , that castle fortress on the Sussex coast which the Conqueror 's own brother built upon the spot where William landed . The presence of the Lord of Pevensey reflected glory on them all .  | Thomas was pleased as well . Lord Richer with his tall spare frame and laconic offhand way , his great name and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father 's guests . And when the day arrived he hung around the courtyard , hot and fly-bedeviled , waiting for the lord 's arrival with his train , although he knew full well they could not ride the whole way up from Pevensey much before suppertime , even at the fast lrnightspace the baron rode . The sun had dropped behind the high square tower of St. Paul 's across the rooftops and the shadow of the courtyard wall had crept almost to the stables when he heard the shouting in the streets as men and women scattered to make way for the tall quick-trotting horses of the baron 's train . The groom ran to the gate , the servants gathered at the kitchen entrance to peer around the house , and Gilbert came downstairs to stand outside the doorway with his son . The baron and his men rode through the gate , their hoods thrown back , their harness jingling , the horses weary , throwing their legs a little , mouths open against the bit and breathing loud . They halted , and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon his shoulder , until the boy stood in the position of the host beside Lord Richer 's mount . Thomas felt the horse 's flanks heave close beside him , smelling of sweat and lathered where the stirrups rubbed . But Lord Richer , as he swung down and away , seemed fresh and held himself with straight-backed ease . Save for one long dark patch of sweat which stained his jerkin  --  of which he seemed all unaware ? one would have thought that he had ridden no farther than from Newgate down the street . He smiled and formally embraced his host and gave instructions , casually , about the horses before he sauntered into the house . Thus it was , thought Thomas , to be a great lord : above all weariness . After supper Lord Richer called Thomas to him . The table had been cleared away and the baron sat in the only high-backed chair , sprawling as he leaned against it with his legs flung out , and yet not lounging but in every line correct . " So you like my horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his eyes watched , but the rest of him was still . " Do you know horses as a young man should ? "  | Thomas was puzzled . He knew his father 's horses by their names . Was this the way a young man should ? He knew his mother 's palfrey well ; he had ridden her all the way from Merton . " I know Gray Mouse , " he said . " He knows Gray Mouse . " Lord Richer raised his eyes to Gilbert , then looked again at Thomas . " So you are studying to be a clerk . " There was a curious blank look in his face which Thomas could not read . Was this disapproval ? " And learning Latin . That horse of mine you like so well has a Latin name . Anderida . Can you tell me what that means ? " " Anderida . " Thomas ' mind searched all the Latin verses he had learned . " No , sir , " he said . " Why , Anderida was a Roman fort . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they called it , in the Latin , when they put their bastions there . " He looked at Gilbert , man to man . " They were good builders , too , those ancients , " he told him . " Their outer walls still stand . " So I have called my strong horse after that strong old fort , " he said to Thomas , " in the Latin tongue . " Thomas understood . Latin was of service when it came to naming horses , a kind of plaything , used by clerks , perhaps , for other purposes , but otherwise of little use . Lord Richer neither read nor wrote ; were these accomplishments indeed no more than little tricks for clerks to occupy themselves with ? Thomas did not know . In all things he could wish himself to be exactly like Lord Richer . And yet the canons felt that learning Latin and the arts of grammar , rhetoric and dialectic were of the very first importance . And he had felt so too , at Merton . " Your father tells me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse fair on the edge of town tomorrow . Shall we ride out and see ? " " You may find it very hot on Smoothfield , my lord , " Gilbert broke in . " And there is little shelter there . " The baron did not bother even to look up at his host . He spoke directly to the boy : " Thomas and I care nothing for hot or cold when there are horses to be seen and judged , eh , Tom ? " Thomas saw at once that this was rudeness , and he had not yet learned to differentiate between the rudeness of a lord and that of a common man . He stood tongue-tied , shaking his head , before the baron .  | " Good , " said Lord Richer , dismissing him . " Then after dinner we shall ride out and see the horses . " Thomas rode beside the Lord of Pevensey , very small on Gray Mouse beside the towering Anderida . Behind them rode the groom and two men of the baron 's company . They passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swine and sheep and cows and docile horses for their carts . Lord Richer did not waste a glance on these . Bait on the trampled meadow of the horse-fair grounds he stopped , dismounted , and with his own hands helped Thomas slide down from the mare . Thomas did not need the help , but Richer was attentive . He led him , almost as a father might , his hand in gentle grip upon his neck , across the grass to where a crowd of quite a different sort ? knights , earls and barons , as well as many citizens of rank ? were looking at the horses . At the first group he paused and bent to speak close beside Thomas ' ear , letting his hand slide down the boyish shoulder and the arm . " These are palfreys , like your Gray Mouse , Tom , " he said , pointing with his other hand at the small soft-gaited horses pacing before them . " Watch how they lift their feet , one side together . " Farther along , the sturdier horses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kicking the dust . And then the high-bred colts , unbroken , moving springily across the turf behind their handlers . Richer pointed out the best of each , still holding Thomas ' arm . But when the destriers , the costly horses that knights ride to war , were shown , Lord Richer straightened and forgot the boy . They were big animals with thick arching necks and heavy haunches , heavy in the legs . But for all their size and weight they skittered sideways like the colts , their nostrils flaring and ears quivering , when men crowded up to look . Lord Richer watched them closely and found one to ask about and run his hands over , feeling the chest and legs . Then suddenly a shout was raised and the men stopped their talking and looked around . A race was to be run between three of the fastest destriers , and now the slower horses were being led away , a path was being cleared to make a course . Lord Richer took a quick look at the three , each in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win , " he said in confidence to the old knight who stood beside him . But before a wager could be made he thought of Thomas and turned back to find him standing in the crowd . The horses were lined up and boys were boosted to sit monkeylike upon their backs . Richer took Thomas by the elbows and lifted him so that he might see over the heads in front . They watched the horses toss their heads and sidle and kick up a screen of dust . Then at the shout of " Go ! " they saw the handlers spring back , the horses plunge into a gallop while the boys astride them whipped at their sides . Lord Richer , holding Thomas , tightened his arms as though he were excited as the boy . And Thomas , watching the horses stretch out in their stride , hearing the thud of hoofs against the ground , wished with his whole heart that he too , someday , might ride like wind and thunder over the earth mounted upon a destrier like these . Lord Richer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was busy at the court in Westminster but he returned to Cheapside often . Several times he mentioned , lightly , that as he had no family of his own perhaps he would adopt the merchant 's son . But though the offer pleased the father by its flattery , the jesting tones in which it was always made precluded serious discussion . He could do nothing more than laugh with a blush of pleasure in response . " Thomas , " said Richer , turning to the boy on the eve of his departure , " how would you like to come to Pevensey with me ? " Thomas smiled , his face full of the fresh eagerness of ten years old , but he remembered also that plans had been made for his return to Merton the next week . His eyes turned to his father 's face in doubt ; the baron noted it . " Next summer , " he said quickly . He did not care to risk the indecision of a merchant torn between ambitions for his son . " Go to your monks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be most useful to you . " He stood up . Later , as the light was dying under the low ceiling of summer clouds , Lord Richer descended to the courtyard to see that all  | was ready for a dawn departure . His host went with him , and the two men stood together for a moment outside the stables . " There are some things a boy should learn before he grows too old , " the baron said . " His horses and his hawks , and how to conduct himself at court . " He paused and stared at Gilbert , not really seeing him . " Hunting and hawking , providing knight 's service for the king , attending his Great Councils , presiding over one 's own court , these are the proper occupations of a man as I have learned them . " The merchant nodded in the twilight and held his tongue . " I have at Pevensey , " the lord continued , " several young men training up for knighthood . If you send Thomas to me for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the father knew , far above his station . These " young men training up for knighthood " would be the sons of great baronial families like Lord Richer 's own . Thomas could not hope to rise with them into the ranks of aristocracy . Yet what he learned with them would be of value to him , and Thomas was a boy worth teaching . The prior saw it , and now the baron saw it too . All saw the value of his son . " We would be honored to send him to you , " he said soberly . " Nothing , it 's nothing , " the baron brushed away his thanks . " Surely I owe you something for your hospitality . " " Thank you , my lord , " said Gilbert , standing back to let the baron pass before him toward the door . Thus Thomas spent his growing years : from mid-September to the end of June among the canons in the thatched cloisters and wide rambling half-cleared acres of St. Mary 's Priory at Merton ; the summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Richer 's castle built on a flat gray neck of land that stretched out from the Sussex coast ; and for a score of days between his journeyings to Pevensey or Merton he lived in London , ever more a stranger in his father 's hall , wrenched with the emotions of arrivals and departures . As the years of separation passed , his mother grew less close , increasingly intent on matters he knew nothing of , on shaping the younger girls for marriage , on duties in a household where he was but a guest , on devotions and secret charities now hidden  | even from her son . Always she greeted him at the door when he came home , exclaiming always at his size as he grew up to stand a head above her , weeping , always , at his departures , but they were strangers . With his father he kept a closer contact for the two sat side by side at dinner now and Gilbert drew his son out with appropriate remarks to speak  --  with modesty , he early learned the worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tiltyard . And after dinner the father took his tall successful son into the city so that he might be seen by men of consequence and so that he might see , also , the lands and properties which Gilbert bought , for Gilbert did less of trading as the years went by and became instead a man of property , living on rents . And there were , as always , guests for Thomas to help entertain and plans for future entertainments wherein the father could instruct the son in the high art of hospitality . In the first years it was to Merton that Thomas returned with the greatest pleasure . There his place was secure among the canons and the students , seemingly unchanging . When he was fourteen he took the tonsure with the other boys when the bishop came to administer this rite , although it was not planned that he should enter higher orders . His father thought a lifelong dedication to the Augustinian Order not fitting for his son . And Thomas , in most anguished adolescent prayer , discovered that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Yet when his crown was shaved he thought he felt the hand of God upon him and he vowed to follow all his life the rules of poverty , obedience and chastity . But from that year there was divergence in the aims  --  and thus a lessening of comradeship  --  between those of his friends destined to be Canons Regular within the Order and himself , a secular clerk . Sometimes thereafter he felt alone and very much apart within his circle of companions at the priory . One confidant he had , not among boys of his own age but Canon Robert , whose duty was to supervise some of the scholars ' lessons . He was a small young man , unprepossessing , shy . He had been taught in childhood that God gave to man the power of choice and that man , through his will and fortified by grace ,  | might choose good over evil . But in his Innocence , observing evil all arornrd him as a child , he had concluded IMte:1v that few men had the will and God most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merton , a frail frightened boy . And as he grew up there he was astonished , every time , to find how often men chose good . Now he was grown , and undo rstood , forgave , and loved mankind . And yet there lingered in him that faint astonishment , a sense of gratitude , whenever he saw evil cv , . rcome . This made him shy of men . It was a fragile bond between the bright successful student lull of accomplishments and the small cl , riet man whose sober contemplation was surprised from time to time by happy , startled , inward thanks to God . It grew from something new in Thomas ' life  --  something he had surmised , had glimpsed , but never fully recognized . Thomas at fourteen had already learoccl to study faces and to judge men thereby , to a certain depth . ( : , anon Iiobert 's face , when he first judged it , left him with but a mild impression of reserve , self-abnegation . But there was something more . He looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a broad forehead under a peaked hairline ; so far a scholar 's face . The lower half was disappointing : a tight month , withdrawn , above a jutting knob of chin . Thomas frowned , concentrating , and the canon glanced up , into his eyes . There should have been a look of admonition or a reprimand ; a student 's mind should not stray from his work . Instead the canon smiled his brief , abstracted smile and then it was , through those mild violet eyes , that Thomas glimpsed a world he did not know  --  another life , a kingdom as it were , that " sea of endless light and bright eternity " men wrote about . Robert , absorbed in contemplation , hardly aware that he had glanced up , looked down again upon his book . But Thomas sat wide-eyed in thought . He had seen other men at prayer ; prayer was the center of his life , with study , here at Merton . He woke to prayer and fell asleep to prayer . But it had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , he saw now , he understood , it did . At home in London , and at Pevensey , his father and his patron said that he would soon know all the canons had to teach him .  | He had not contradicted them . Now he perceived that there was something more to learn here at the priory other than what was taught by rote out of the books . But it was not the sort of thing , he realized , that he learned easily . How was it done ? Thomas sat frowning , head bent , cut off from the world . To learn such things might take a lifetime . Could he attempt it , living here quietly out of the world for his whole life  --  and risking failure in the end ? But the decision was not his to make . His father told him , after the year was over and he went home in June : Thomas would not return to Merton any more .  | vIUantAS MADE THE TRIP to Pevensey 1 &)tre; that slimmer , the sonuner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tonbridge Castle nv Lord Richer had arranged , accompanied only by one groom At Iiltrrn he no longer needed to be dealt with as a child and the toads were peaceful male : the stern rule of the old king . Rot he was tired as he apI-toached the fort . The wind blew sharp against hint Irom the ocean , filling his eyes and catching the haeath out of his mouth , and far ahead the castle stood out lonely on its isthmus beyond the ditch and stretch of wall that cut it limn the mainland . He had to pull himself together as he slowed his horse to walk across the bridge , for on the other side heard Itieher 's guards were watching his approach , squatting in the lee of the old Boman bastion , squinting into the last long r ; ivs of the sun . Ile held his back straight and his toes slim ' ) pointed as he rode over the rattling planks and reined his horse before them . The sergeant , with some grunting , rose from the three-legged stool which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas , " he said , walking toward him with a smile . " Welcome hack . How are the roads from London ? " Thomas smiled down at him . This was the first step , always , i n t o the world of Pevensey and the personality expected of him there , this greeting at the gate . Heretofore others had smoothed the transit for him . " The roads are peaceable , " he said . " And all give way to me and my men . " The groom behind him snorted and the sergeant laughed . But his eyes had traveled nip to Thomas ' head ; he stared at the shorn circle of the tonsure . " What 's this , Tom . Have you been taking vows ? " he said with no pretense at hiding his disapproval . " I have vowed , " said Thomas , forcing such lightness as he could into his voice , " with the help of one more powerful than I , " he grinned , " to catch a hundred eels this summer . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back when the big sergeant had volunteered to teach him to catch eels and the two had spent a morning sloshing in the ditch to no avail . It was the one point of personal contact that the two had . One of the guardsmen understood the jibe and laughed , and the sergeant screwed up his face ruefully as Thomas grinned again and rode on through the gate . The men looked after him appraisingly . The boy was tired , that was obvious  --  perhaps too obvious  --  but he was game . The fact that they made no disparaging remarks  --  unusual for them when newcomers passed by  --  was as high compliment to Thomas as any praise from men of different station . They liked him , for he had been quicker than the other boys to learn the knack of getting on with men of all occupations . And Thomas , as he rode away , aware that they were watching , felt that their eyes were on his tonsure , but he knew not whether to be ashamed or proud . He did not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him  --  except that they should like him . The outer bailey court of Pevensey was large , ten acres of uneven , salt-encrusted ground enclosed by the old Roman wall . This time of evening it was quiet , all the worksheds and the long low barns deserted , horses in their stables , villeins in their huts  --  as though the sun in going down had drained the life from it . Thomas rode in silence through the darkening , sea-filled air along the cobbled road . Ahead of him , beyond the spiky palisade that walled the inner bailey , rose the massive battlements and towers of the fort . The Norman keep stood clean-lined and uncompromising in the embrace of the old rounded bastions and the pink light glinted on the crenelated walls . Thomas felt once again that quickening anticipation , blended of fear and pleasure , that he always felt when he approached Lord Richer 's castle . That he was being tested here he knew , but for what purpose he could not be sure . He rode unchallenged through the wooden gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was life . Miles Mauduit , his best friend at Pevensey , ran up to greet him shouting and announced , almost before Thomas could find his legs upon the ground , that his father  --  a chamberlain to King  | Henry , Thomas knew  --  had promised to . they heirship to the castle and the lands of Gifford with , Jle , hetress Margaret . " If the king so wills of course , " he " 1 think the king will give his grace to it . They say ty , " he added . " And some day I shall have an honor an 1111 , titwnl " Thomas held out his hands but Mlles btYt d them aside and flung his arms about him . Then he stood htaolt , laughing , flexing his knees in a peculiar way he had , especially before some test or tournament . The other boys roveaIr+I tht% Mani- unrest and high expectancy as Thomas moved unsung them toward the keep . King Henry had announced a visit to the castle sometime this summer . He would stop here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the Channel . ' 1'hls was important to these adolescent boys , not for the feasting or the sport that would attend the visit but because , although they were related  --  all but Thomas  --  to great baronial families or high officers in the king 's court , not all of them were heirs . Most were younger sons , or bastards , without fixed inheritance , and their promotion lay in the king 's favor or in the influence of courtiers close to him . Thomas had known , of course  --  even at ? Merton such news was eagerly discussed  --  about the birth of the kings grandson , Henry , at Le Mans in March , and that the king would go to Normandy to see him . But in the priory such news had not the personal meaning that it had at Pevensey . Ile smiled and clapped his friends upon the back and promised them that they should all be earls . And then he went to find Lord Richer and announce his presence in the castle . The hall at Pevensey was beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed both dim and quiet . It was a huge room , massive and unadorned , a man 's hall , roofed with heavy smoke-stained oak and floored with oak as well . The only light came from the narrow windows , and fell soft and slanting , funneled through twenty feet of wall . The room was almost empty now . Only a few , some clerks and courtiers , lingered here after supper . The servingmen were finishing their evening 's work , dismantling the supper tables , carrying benches to the windows , stacking the boards and tres- ties against the wall . They moved like shadows , and the dogs , still nosing in the rushes where the tables had been set , were almost lost in darkness . Only at the farthest end did any color show . There , where the wall was rounded like the apse of some great church , a row of rush lights burned . They spread a soft and flickering light on Richer l'Aigle 's scarlet mantle and on the wimples of the ladies who had gathered there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even before Thomas had made his way down half the dusky length . He stood in conversation with his steward and his chaplain over a matter which had come before his honor court the week before . The chaplain was insisting that he read the tally over while the steward tried to cut him short . And the lord listened , with the lights behind him and his eyes upon the slender boy who came across the rush-strewn floor . He watched him briefly pause beneath a window where a game board had been set and two old friends were sitting clown to play , again to let a servant carry a bench across his path and say a word to him , and yet again to pat and gently push aside the Liam hound that came to smell his hand and lean against him . The Lady Juliana , wife of the steward , called to him from where she sat among the other ladies and Thomas turned and bowed and spoke an answer to her greeting , grave and flattering . And all the while the baron watched . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer held the look that had been in them . He bade him welcome formally as the boy knelt . Then , since Thomas had come late for supper and had not eaten on the road , he sent him to the kitchen for some food and turned again to listen to the chaplain as though that matter of his honor court compelled his full attention . When Thomas came back carrying his cup of beer and slabs of bread and , vension he found the boys had drifted in with darkness . More rushes had been lit and they were in their favorite corner nearest to the door . There they were not so much noticed by the clerks who huddled over their chess boards or vagrant knights searching about for resting places , and they were at the greatest distance from the lords and ladies by the  | dais at the far end . For pages the safo rule do your duty and then disappear . They welcomed Thomas and made room far him and continued to talk earnestly , as all the court was talking , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be brought to England for his nourishing , " said 1 ? dric . Edric always made himself conspicuous by praising English things . He even wore his hair in the old Saxon way , down to his shoulders , although he was a Norman like than rest of them . Miles laughed at him . " ' The proper cradle for a- Norman king is Normandy , ' he quoted . " You heard the constable . " Indeed , their arguments were only echoes of their elders ' thoughts . " What does Lord Richer say ? " asked Tlronras with his mouth full . " Oh , he 's concerned about succession to the throne if the old king should die before the baby 's old enough to rule ; he does n't care what happens so long as they both live . But lre s afraid  --  I heard him say so to the constable . . . " " But Empress Matilda would be queen if the ( ) Id king should die , " said Edric interrupting . " All the barons took an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succession . " Miles rolled his eyes at Thomas . " God 's breath what innocence ! " he said . And then to Edric : " I would n't give much for that oath now . Nobody takes it seriously since she remarried . " " An oath 's an oath , " said Edric stubbornly . " My father said so . And all the earls and barons swore that they would make Matilda queen whenever the king died . " He saw Miles ' smirk and burst out , " Oh you can laugh . You always laugh at me . That 's all you know . Father was there ; all the important lords were there . And they swore solemnly that since the prince had died in the White Ship and Empress Matilda was the only lawful child , then they would do as the king asked ... " " I would n't know about your father , " Miles said scornfully . " But other people 's fathers are more sensible . Listen , simpleton , Empress Matilda was a widow then . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England if she had still been married to the German emperor ? " He looked for confirmation at the other boys and they all shook their heads . " Well , then , is n't it just the same thing since she 's married to the Count of  | Anjou ? Do you think they 're going to hand the throne of England to some dirty Angevin ? " Again the boys all shook their heads , but Edric said , " My father would . And anyway , if he 's so dirty , what about his son ? I guess you 'd have to call the little prince an Angevin , would n't you ? " he said triumphantly . The other boys were torn between his logic and their loyalty to Miles , but Miles was unimpressed . " No , he 's a Norman , " he said . Seeing his friend on shaky ground , Thomas took up the argument . He swallowed his last gulp of beer , put the empty cup down on the floor between his feet , and said with slow deliberation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : If a man 's grandfather is Norman , and if his mother is a Norman too , then he is twothirds Norman . And if he 's reared in Normandy and speaks the Norman tongue , that 's two more points for him . That makes him one and a third points Norman  --  even more Norman than you are , Edric , since you are only one . Therefore you have no argument . Prince Henry is a Norman and should be raised in Normandy . And one more item : he must grow to be a man before King Henry dies . Is n't that right , Miles ? " Miles snatched the empty cup up from the floor . " Long life to the king ! " he shouted , jumping up . Thomas sat laughing up at him , but in his heart he was uneasy that they should speak lightly of such solemn things . At Merton he had prayed that God protect the baby , Henry , born to be his king . He did not want Miles ' laughter , or his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miles , he put it down beneath the bench once more and used this moment , with his head bent , close to his knees , to whisper hastily , " Almighty God , and King of Kings . . . ruler of princes . . . I humbly beseech thee , bless the baby , young Prince Henry . . . and forgive our trespasses . " IIe looked , up smiling once again and said , " My eyes will not stay open any more ; I have to go to sleep . " Thomas ' tonsure caused less remark among his fellows in the hall than it had among the footsoldiers at the gate . Most of the boys had high connections in the Church , and their conception  | d 111 hither helmeted and wearing a - his robes , ddhg ? fleshier in preference to a m big baronial p- %trong-walled castles , was 1 their own act anee.hip with high-born cousins . ( or granted nrrl questioning that Thomas wotlld Church as row in the service of the king . 61 ' I hntnas knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These boys with whom he learned to knot and hawk , w11h ss Iona he slept upon the rushes in the hap , with whom he w.i% ? uiI the baron wine at dinner , needed only a Rrwt slight boost u ( luck to rise to places of high title all their own . Thomas would mistier far more luck  --  some twist of fate entirely unforeseen ? n well as all his charm and application . Mx they both knew , ulthough they did not speak of it . To the baton it presented an lolr-esting element of gamble as he toyed with the boy 's future . And in Thomas , heart-set on excelling in all things , it bred an ohduante determination , centered on himself . There was a little crooked dwarf the baron kept for his amusement  --  Valeran Fitz Pain , a long name for so small a man . He had an ugly body and a croaking voice , nor had he any talents sl It as turning somersaults or juggling with plates . One attribute he had : a piercing eye to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No matter with what desperate subterfuge a man or boy might try to camouflage those things that made him different from his fellows , Valeran saw straight through to where he suffered and there found opportunity for sport . The baron liked to laugh and Valeran provided laughter . This was the way he earned his keep ; he was unfit for any other occupation . Long ago , when Valeran first looked at Thomas , his eyes had glowed to see the way the boy sat slack-limbed on his palfrey , quivering with fatigue , as he rode through the inner gate that summer of his introduction to the castle . The dwarf stood on the steps and watched the way the boy 's legs buckled under him when he slid to the ground . " Guard ho ! Guard hol " he called in his frog 's voice , " Man the battlements ! A strange knight enters through our gates ! " Then he had scampered down the stairs and challenged Thomas to single combat . In later summers he found cause for jesting in the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but " lay with monks " throughout the winter and came to the castle looking lean and spent . He gave a dissertation one day at dinner on the likenesses between this boy and a feather bed in that they both looked worn and flat after an active night , " abbots lie heavy , so I have been told , " but were so easily puffed up . And for a while , when he was twelve years old , Thomas had had to smile down the nickname " feather bed . " Valeran might have found good fuel for laughter in the baron 's eyes whenever they dwelt long upon the boy , but he was not kept to make sport of his lord . Instead , this year , he built his jokes upon the comic prospect of a tonsured Cheapside peddler genuflecting to fat housewives , calling his wares in learned accents : " Agnus Dei , buy my chamber pots . " Thomas had to strive to keep his temper while the table laughed , and Richer , through his laughter , watched him , gauging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile , the steady hands holding the ewer of wine , and he approved . But looking in the eyes he paused and withheld judgment , for there he saw not only pride , which he found good , but scorn and something of a promise that the jests would be remembered and repaid . The baron frowned . Boys under his roof must take hard lessons in the art of sportsmanship , in the hall as well as in the field . That Thomas ' lessons were invariably harder than those of his fellows he understood . Indeed , it gave him an oblique pleasure . This boy must pass unscathed the hardest tests ; he must be perfect . So Thomas fought , under his tutelage , for perfection . Now he could manage the huge war horses that the baron rode , sitting high , knees straight , toes pointed in the long stirrups . He had learned to wear a heavy kite-shaped shield upon his left arm and carry in his right a long forked lance . And in the practice tourneys which the boys held out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend Miles Mauduit were the most successful in unhorsing their opponents . By now he played a tolerable game of chess and in the hall his manners were all that could be wished . He seemed to have a way of speaking to this man or that so that each found a different way of praising him . One clay Lord Richer , standing with his  | page deleted  | " Talking to her ? " Thomas persisted . Hugh looked down at him and saw him clearly for the first time  --  not just another boy , but someone interested in his work . " Yes , talking to her you might say , " he said . " This is the way it is . " He eased himself onto a bench . " When you 've caught a hawk she 's lonely for her freedom , wants to fly away . You have to keep her in the dark so she wo n't bait . " " Bait ? " Thomas asked . " Try to fly away  --  and get caught in her jesses , " Hugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to coax her to take food . She 's hungry , but she wo n't eat . Give her a piece of meat . . . " Hugh pinched his thumb and forefinger together . " And then you rub a feather on her legs . " He waved his left hand gently back and forth under his right . " And when she takes the food . . . " He made a low whistle like the sound Thomas had heard within the shed . " She 's got to know your call , you see . She 's got to know that that means food . Otherwise , the baron takes her out for sport and once she 's gone after her prey she wo n't come back . " " And when she 's trained will she come back to your whistle ? " Thomas asked . Hugh laughed . " Oh well , there 's more to it than that ! " he said . " First the whistle till she eats . Then when she comes to you you can take the training hood off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's got to know the glove , so you can take her . Then the lure . . . Oh no , there 's more to it than that ! " He looked at Thomas ' earnest face , full of the intensity of learning , and said in a low voice , as though he were ashamed , " You 've got to treat her right , you 've got to feel the way she feels . A hawk 's a living thing you know , she 's wild , she 's . . . " He could not find the word . " A hawk is beauty , that 's what she is . " " Oh may I see her ? " Thomas asked . Hugh shook his head . " She ca n't bear strangers yet . " He rose . " You run and " play now . I have work to do . " He looked down at Thomas . " You can come back , " he said . " Come back when you want . You can tell anyone who asks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whenever he was free  --  in that first summer and the summers afterward  --  he came back to the grassy plot among the sheds and cages of the mews where young hawks  | wheeled in the salt air above , trying their , . *nil where the smell was strong of raw meat and of birds snit r+atl-er trappings . He watched and listened and was useful , learning all he could , till , as the years went by , he grew to knew the cltlle , ent hawks , their training and their modes of hunting , and how to handle them . And by the time he was sixteen 1-n was addicted to the sport of falconry . That year  --  the year he was sixteen  --  Thomas spent entirely at Pevensey , making only two short visits honan , as he had done from Merton . Most of the older boys , the ones he had known best , were gone now . Miles Mauduit had been knighted and held a castle of his own within the honor of his father-in-law . There was a group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pevensey each year for nourishing in the arts of aristocracy , but Thomas , though he could command their services by right of his seniority , had little contact with them . When the baron was in residence Thomas spent his time with him , hunting and hawking , an accepted member of his party . And when the lord was absent on tours of his other holdings or visits to the court Thomas rode out alone or trained a favorite hawk , or else he played a game of chess or talked of bookish matters with the chaplain . It was an easy life and Thomas might have stayed forever at the castle , he presumed , filling some indefinite post  --  helping with the book work of the clerks , perhaps , or simply for the baron 's pleasure , as Valeran Fitz Pain was kept . But he was restless , his ambition pricking him . Only with Lord Richer did he forget the future in the excitement of each day 's activity . One summer day the two rode out to hawk alone , with just one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , following and crisscrossing the wooded streams that ran through open meadows toward the sea , the baron not so keen as was his wont but sitting careless in the saddle , keeping the falcon hooded on his wrist and letting the dog run freely . He was content today to let the sport come where it may , and he talked softly as they went , his words compelling , of the pleasures of the hunt , the waiting for the quarry to break cover , and the chase . There was  | a vibrance in his voice that few had ever heard and he laughed softly more than was his habit , turning and looking often into the boy 's face as they rode knee to knee . And Thomas rode  --  not ignorant , he knew there were such men . But still unwilling , at sixteen , to recognize the danger , still flattered that the baron chose his company , still innocent  --  beside Lord Richer , smiling , nodding , but never looking at his face . They reached a reedy stretch along a millstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baron speaking quietly to the dog as he removed the falcon 's hood and cast her off . She rose from the gauntlet , the bells tinkling on her legs , and climbed in sweeping , free-winged circles to her place of vantage in the sky . Then Richer gave a sharp command . The dog ran forward into the reedy growth , raising a frightened , rustling flight of grouse . High overhead the peregrine chose her prey and dove , straight and swift as a falling plummet , down on the helpless bird . She made her strike and feathers sprinkled the blue sky , but she had missed her grip . The wounded bird swerved toward the nearest cover and the peregrine once more started her circling climb . The baron pricked his horse into a gallop , keeping his eyes upon the spot of cover where the bird lay hidden , for they must flush it once again to serve the waiting falcon lest she fly after some other quarry and be lost . The stream now lay between them and their game , too deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank , searching for a crossing place , with the dog following . Where foliage grew high along the water 's edge the baron laid his head along his horse 's neck and plunged through . Thomas , following close into the slapping branches , pulled up his hood to cover his face and head and bent low in the saddle . He did not see the clearing by the mill as quickly as the baron did , nor the little footbridge spanning the narrow race . And thus he overshot , and while the baron 's horse was already stepping gingerly onto the other side , he was still pulling in his own horse , wheeling it , urging it all too hastily across the slippery plank . He saw the water racing under him and heard the slap and thunder of the mill wheel just below . His hand upon the rein betrayed excitement and the horse felt it , tried to back away ,  | saurpr ( I into air and fell , hoofs el . ream below . Timms was thrown clear but his hlo- , twisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current =etched him . The baron , riding on , turned to MI followed him . Ile had not marked the splash under Is mar . Now he saw Thomas ' horse , dripping and wvllh water , heaving Itself up the farther bank , the saddle empty , Ile lamed , and with his face all made of iron and hand of Icon on the reins , galloped across the shaking plank . But he was late Ili saw the boy with his head hidden in the floating hood drawn in the clear swift waters of the race toward the great h-nnmering paddles of the wheel . Ile cupped his hands around his mouth end filled his lungs to shout to the oblivious miller within the mlllhnuse : Stop the wheel ! But even as he shouted the wheel stopped , and in the sudden silence the man appeared , shaking the flour from his apron . The miller was astonished to see a horseman riding at him with his arm outstretched . But when he looked to where the man was pointing he acted with great speed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with it snoring the boy 's floating clothes and drawing him to shore even before the baron could dismount and run to his side . Together thev pulled Thomas onto the grass and tore the hood clear of his head . His is face was white , his mouth was open , retching and gasping . The baron smiled a thin smile and stepped back . " He 'll be all right , " he said . The miller did not speak . He rolled the boy upon his face and pressed his large hands , hard and carefully , against his back until the water gushed out from the open mouth . Then he called over his shoulder to his wife . Thomas , moaning on the grass , was conscious of the call . It was the first sound he heard after the roaring in his ears . He frowned under a flood of dizziness and pain , opening his eyes . All that he saw as he looked once again upon the world was silvery and gold : the fuzzy blades of grass before his face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunshine through  | translucent leaves beyond , all glowing as if in a sea of light ? that sea of endless light and bright eternity that he had glimpsed before . Before . At Merton . That promised sea of light ! A terror and a longing sprang up in his heart and he began to weep . The miller 's wife came running from the house and sank down on the ground beside him . She wiped the slime and water from his nose and mouth and Thomas looked up through his tears to see the baron 's face , watching as from far off . For a long moment the two looked , one standing , one upon the ground , a long inquiring look through that expanse of air . Then Thomas jerked away and rolled upon his knees and knelt with head bent over his clenched fists . He knew now , recognized , the life the baron offered . He knew where he had purposely not known before , because before he had not made a choice about his life and was content to drift . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clear translucent sky , threw light into the darkness of his future here at Pevensey  --  the safe life , but degrading . More than degrading , insult to all he was . Shaken and sickened he knelt , as he had not knelt since he left Merton , curled in a shuddering ball , and felt the baron 's eyes upon him and recoiled . The miller and his wife drew back in deference and then looked to the baron . They were astonished to see his well-bred face all drawn up in disgust . He turned away and walked to where the boy 's horse stood beside his own , cropping the grass , and felt along its legs , lifting its hoofs , to set if it had suffered any injury . " Let the boy stay with us a little while , " the miller said . The baron straightened . With his back to them he lifted up his arms and let his hands rest on the saddle . At last he spoke . " Aye , let him stay , " he said over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then he moved quickly , loosening the girth and lifting the wet saddle with its blanket to the ground and looping the reins over it . " He knows the way back to the castle when he wants to come , " he said . He took his own horse by the bridle , called to the dog where it lay panting on the grass , and gave one useless glance into the  | the peregrine was gone . Then he saddle and dr. off . And Thomas , on his knees , heard t fs , the arant clip-clop of them upon the h  | iF HAVE BEEN TOLD there was a miracle concerning a mill wheel , " William Fitzstephen offered eagerly , " when he was saved from drowning ... " Brother Benedict , to whom he spoke , bent his head as though to examine the long-handled dipper that lay across his knees . He did not answer . The two men sat in the dark crowded crypt at Canterbury ; it was soft summer of 1171 . Thomas had been dead six months and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dropsical were cured and men possessed were freed of demons . Candles were lighted most mysteriously , and barns and houses saved from fire , and ships upheld at sea . The blind saw and the deaf heard and the lame rose up from their beds and walked , all in his name . Ever since Prior Odo had agreed to let the people come into the crypt the scene there  --  so wrote Benedict  --  was like the scene beside the pool of Bethesda . " Wonders , great miracles , " he wrote , " daily occur . " These were the words with which he introduced the catalogue of miracles he was compiling for the chapter of the monks at Christchurch . He and the young monk Roger had been deputed by Prior Odo to guard the sacred body and tend the pilgrims  --  and to collect , in the long-handled dipper , their offerings to the Church . Of his own will he had begun , after the first few days , to listen to the pilgrims ' tales , sift them for truth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Chapter House . He sat now near the martyr 's tomb , resting , and with him sat the clerk . William was also keeping an account of all the miracles he could get wind of , not only of the wonders done in Thomas ' name after his death  --  these were becoming almost commonplace ? hut those that had occurred while he yet lived . He had in mind to write a life of Thomas , for he had known him well . But he  | had never witnessed , nor even could rememlwr talk of , any truly miraculous incident that he could write alxmt . So he had set himself to seek some out . He spoke now , eagerly , his mobile hand gesturing before him and his freckled face alight . " The miracle ( x e w reel when he was but a boy , " he said to Benedict . " The trill wheel stopped as by the hand of God , so I have heard , miraculously , just as our lord was being flung into its arms ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these last months of listening to tales of miracles he had become alert to innocent exaggeration or imposture . He said nothing . The long procession of the pilgrims to the tomb moved quietly before them and the swish and echo of their footsteps mingled with the chant of plainsong , for the monks were singing in the Chapter House far off . Sometimes a cry or sounds of excited voices drifted down to them from the transepts of the church above where sick and weary travelers had spread themselves in every shrine and corner . William dropped his voice a notch . " The miracle is well attested , " he said in a half-whisper . " Master Grim of Cambridge tells of it quite positively . Thomas was hawking with a certain lord who was his companion in those days and his hawk , following a duck which was its prey , lit on the waters of a millrace and was drawn under . In plunged Thomas  --  giving no thought to his own safety  --  to save the hawk , and straightway was himself caught in the race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his death  --  suddenly the mill wheel stopped ! And in the twinkling of an eye the water stopped its rushing and became as still as any silent pool . " He paused , not long enough to give the monk an opening . " Nor did the current move again to turn the wheel till Thomas , as by an unseen hand , was lifted out unharmed ! " Again the monk gave him that sidewise glance . " A marvelous tale , " he said . " But tell me , Master William , do you have wit-nesses ? " Fitzstephen drew back . " I had the story straight from William Grim , " he said . " And William Grim was there when this occurred  --  this mill wheel stopped so suddenly , and the water with it ? " A little frown tightened Fitzstephen 's forehead . " You know as  | well as I do , Brother Benedict , that he first met the archbishop the very day that he was murdered . No , he was not there . " " He gave a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know of ? except that lord perhaps . He must be dead by now . . . " He paused . " Perhaps , as you say , I should scratch the story from my account . He sighed . " It is a pity , though . There are few miracles related of his boyhood . Indeed , of his entire lifetime  --  very few . " Benedict sat looking at him a long time . " I do not say the mill wheel did not stop , " he said at last . " I asked you merely who was witness to it . Nor did I say that you should drop the story from your life of Thomas . God works many miracles , I know . I know it better than most men . " He paused , his dark eyes searching William 's face . " But I confess , " he said , " I must confess my incredulity , if incredulity 's a fair name for the hesitation that I feel  --  not on my own account but for the reputation of our lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. . " Indeed , it is a habit with me now to question those who come to testify . For I can not forget , although these simple people may , that there are evil men waiting to show us to the world as frauds and charlatans . You know as well as I do , Master William , that it is the poor and ignorant who come . They testify  --  we must remember this  --  they give their testimony to a hostile world . And it is for me to check them in their exuberance , lest the true wonders to which their simple hearts bear witness sink in a morass of half-truths and hysteria . " Who is there but myself and young Brother Roger ? What is there but our stubborn incredulity to guard the sacred reputation of our lord ? Why , there came one this morning , a woman , claiming she had been blind for half her life and now restored . Stone blind before ; now she saw as well as I  --  so she would have me think . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnesses . I tell you , Master William , she was of so mean appearance , so shifty and so short of temper , I confess I did mistrust her from the start . " " And she ? " asked William eagerly . Benedict smiled ruefully . " She gave me ugly words in answer to my questions and would not endure the slightest cross-exami- nation . No , she called me hard of heart , wicked , unbelieving and unfit to attend the tomb of such a martyr  --  exactly as you would have labeled me just now , because of my unwelcome questioning about the mill wheel . Is it not so , my friend ? " William grinned foolishly under the earnest gaze and the monk rose and touched him quickly on the arm iuicl turned away . IIe had seen a rush of sudden movement in St. Gabriel 's Chapel across the crypt and sensed that he was needed . A woman , Serena of Yfeld , lay there dying , had lain there all day . Now her last breath was near . Her children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the soft pallet lest , contrary to Christian custom , she should die upon a feather bed . I ; cnecliet had given them a thread out of the martyr 's robe to place beneath her tongue and they had done so although Serena was steadfast in saying only " Thy will be done " instead of praying that her life be spared . Now she lay dying on the cold stone with her children all about her and the young Roger holding a cross for her to see . Benedict hoped that still the saint might intervene . Serena was a woman of pure faith . He crossed the line of pilgrims and made his way to her . William sat staring after him , his sheepish grin fading to a look of contemplation . He knew the worth of the monk 's argument , that formal recognition of the miracles was slow in coming and that as yet no dignitary of the land had followed in the footsteps of the poor to Canterbury . He knew that the de Brocs still menaced travelers who spoke of miracles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devils in the pilgrims so that they might cast them out . Indeed , at Eastertime , after the crypt had first been opened to the populace , Ranulf de Broc himself had come to Prior Odo and drawn his sword and threatened that he would carry off the body from the church . That night the monks , in secret , took the corpse out of its sepulcher and hid it in the dark behind the altar of the Virgin . Only the next day Crippled Richard , son of Einold , had discovered it . That was a curious miracle ; William had witnessed it . Richard was hobbling past the altar where , unknown to him , the body lay when suddenly he cast away his staff and fell upon his face , then rose again , fell down again , and once again rose up and gathered all his strength and leaped upon the  | altar , agile as a boy . When he jumped down it was to stand upon the soles of his two feet like any healthy man . William had run to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain altar , why he had fallen there , why he had leaped on it . And Richard answered , " I was constrained to by the Mother of God . " Thus the monks knew they could not hide the body from the world . They put it back into its sepulcher and called the masons in to build a strong safeguarding wall around it . But for the pilgrims ' sake they left small apertures through which petitioners might reach their heads to kiss the tomb . It was a curious fact , Fitzstephen noted , that some could put their heads through easily  --  indeed , a wild man once had climbed right through ? while others , though they were no larger , were unable to . William , thinking these things , let his gaze fall on the little desk that Benedict used to keep his records on . He saw a pile of parchments weighted by the dipper Benedict had lain across them when he rose to go . William took them up and held them to the light to read . They were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Robert , a smith of Thanet , cured of a pain . . . " " Muriel of Canterbury , two years diseased ... " The clerk 's quick eyes raced over them . " Curbaran , a shoemaker of Dover , absolutely and incredibly simple enough . . . " His eye was caught and held . He lifted the parchment above the others and read on . " Simple enough to say the Lord 's Prayer daily for the soul of the martyr , not knowing that he who prays for a martyr demeans the martyr , was visited in a dream by Thomas who directed him to dig in a certain place under a mill , and he did so and found a very thick and rusty denarius which he tried with his teeth and found to be gold . It was a coin of the Emperor Diocletian and worth some forty silver pieces . . . " William stopped reading and smiled . He felt a glow of gratitude at the shoemaker 's good fortune , simple though he was . Musing , he looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something more . He smiled again as realization struck him ; gratitude for Brother Benedict . He shifted through the parchments and began to read again . " Mad Henry of Fordwich ,  | dragged by his friends to the tomb . . . " All yes , he heard the wild commotion on the steps that morning . . . A heavy woman stood in front of William . Ile looked up to see the matron from the money-smithy with her eve fastened upon him and in her hands a little package wrapped in linen cloth . William smiled cautiously . Over the months Wulviva had become increasingly persistent in her visits to the tomb . The water which had cured her daughter had become quite famous ; since then the monks had made great quantities themselves and with it cured a wide variety of ills  --  and yet her own son Almon remained dumb . Ever more frequently she came , with him or alone , bringing small offerings , pleading . Some of the monks had come to think of her as a reproach . " Master William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What do you think . Our Thomas ' water 's worked another miracle ! " Pride and conspiracy rasped in her voice . She knew he liked to be the first to hear such stories . And William 's face lit as it always lit when he heard promise of exotic news . " I have a neighbor , " she confided . " Blind , and now sees . He came today to beg a drop of our miraculous water and Walter gave it to him , though he holds it dear for his wife 's sake  --  you know that miracle . " Fitzstephen nodded . " Of course , " he said . " The monks have writ it down , " she said with satisfaction . " But this blind man ? " " Walter brought the water and he put his finger in and with it wet his eyes  --  and straight away he wiped away the darkness ! He had come guided , but he went home unguided . It was a miracle . Even Brother Benedict will say it was a miracle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent moment she held William with her gaze and then she let him loose . . William sighed and straightened . " Has the man come to the church ? " he asked . But she had turned away . Her purpose there was to see Brother Benedict . " Oh yes , " she flung the answer over her shoulder . " He will come , with witnesses . It is a happy day for him . " Despite her words her voice had lost its vibrance and she seemed  | to weigh the little package in her hands as though she found it heavy . William watched her as she moved away from him without farewell . His heart was touched with pity for her  --  so immoderate in her enthusiasms , and so vulnerable to disappointment . And something of a pest . He shrugged and once again picked up the parchments . " The boy Edric , ten years old , " he read . " Fell asleep while praying near the tomb . . . suddenly confronted by the martyr in his dreams . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will do nothing for you ... " Again Fitzstephen raised his head , his face creased in a frown . " Why some and why not others ? " Thus he wondered , with his eyes blank and his lips drawn down . In front of him he saw that Benedict was making his way crabwise across the crypt while Wulviva bumped beside him , talking in his ear . William could see the irritation in the monk 's face and the strong resistance to the story he was being told as he came to the desk and snatched the dipper up . Wulviva put her little package in it and moved off , a sag to her broad shoulders . William spoke his thoughts aloud . " Why some , " he said . " And why not others ? " Benedict 's eyes still held their look of stubborn incredulity . And then he nodded ; he knew what William meant . Frail old Serena , of such tenacious and abiding faith , had died . And Almon with his inward seeing eye was dumb . And yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood in silence for a moment , then rebellion faded from his face and it was touched with the deep peace of resignation , of acceptance . " It is not for us to judge , " he said . " Some find relief ; for some there is no help . These things rest with God . " The two sat silent for a little longer , watching the pilgrims absently . ' And when Fitzstephen spoke again it was of those miraculous tales of long ago that he was gathering  --  the miracles of Thomas ' lifetime . " There was a miracle I 've heard concerning some pontificals , " he said doubtfully . " When he was a student in the schools of Paris . . .. "  | THOMAS HAD GONE to Paris in 1137 , the slimmer of his eighteenth year . The incident concerning the miraculous pontificals occurred at the pre-Lenten " Parliament ' Amour " when he was twenty , just before his sad recall to home . The tale was this : " At that annual parley when the student lerics rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , homas the English remained dumb . And when they mocked vim for it , calling him lifeless manikin , he only gently smiled and nswered them : I serve Our Lady . ' At this they mocked the more nd threatened him , saying it will be worse for him if at the laymote the next morning he comes without some sample of fine needlework done by his fair beloved . Thomas goes home and prays , and in the night receives a marvelous tiny casket full f bishop 's vestments , richly embroidered , with miter and with wastoral staff complete . With these he won the contest in the 7irgin 's name , whose champion he was . " That was the story . The truth was something different . Inteed , the incident was not one Thomas would himself have . hosen to relate and might have been forgotten had his history urned out differently . For when he came to Paris , thoughts f bishoprics and martyrdom were far from him . He came as , ther men with eager minds came to the ancient Ile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools of dialectics lately estabshed there . And he had entered into student life as he went into all things : sharp-eyed and smiling , fiercely competitive , vinning his way with a quick wit and laughing voice and holda.g it through hard work , some suffering , and stubborn pride . He had come on foot from London , crossing the Channel in a fishing boat , tramping alone across the continent through the tot summer days , and by the time he reached the city in the seine his white skin was well-blackened by the sun and he had  | gained immeasurably in confidence over the boy who had left Pevensey in sore bewilderment two years before . The intervening years he spent in London , living once more in his father 's hall and going each day to study in St. Paul 's , the foremost of the London grammar schools . He had made good progress in his Latin , rhetoric and logic , and at home had learned to observe his family with a man 's eye rather than a boy 's . There was less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having loosed her hold on him and even on the younger girls , was fading from the busy world she once had known . His father , reaching for stature beyond that of merchant , gave up his trade entirely and now was finding it more risky than he had foreseen to live on rents from crowded wooden dwellings during those years when fire  --  along with the immoderate drinking of her citizens  --  was the acknowledged curse of London . Money was scarce ; home life was quiet . Thomas found interests and pleasures elsewhere . The canons of St. Paul 's commended him for his hard application to his studies , the excellence of his memory . And on the holy days when boys from every London grammar school gathered to wage debates , exhibiting their knowledge and their skill in language , Thomas stood very high . These youthful wrestling bouts of wit , ostensibly for fun , made clear which boys might profit from a further education in the great schools of France and Italy . The canons recommended Paris and his father , proud of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford and sent him off . Thus he reached Paris in late August a tall gaunt young figure , the adolescent awkwardness almost outgrown , sure of himself , or so he thought , in all contingencies after so many days of following foreign ways and nights of finding lodging in strange hostelries or among monks who knew him not . Many the time he had lost his way and had to double back , and many the night he slept in the barn of some kind farmer , eating for supper the bit of bread and cup of watered wine the farmer 's wife set out for him , his tonsure and his destination being his passport to the world 's hospitality . At last , in the last light of a long shimmering summer afternoon he stood before the tower of the Porte de Paris looking  | rvond the great bridge and the crowded river to the city itself , -c island in the Seine . Black shadow on rough masonry and ' tilting sunlight on hewn wood , roof piled over ragged roof , Id shouldering above all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was the city . Thomas loosed the back strap on ) around his neck and let it fall , and with a widening smile f wonder and of challenge he looked up . The world was his - is eighteenth summer of his life , and this was his new home i it . He drew some glances , stopping as he did amid the traffic , it they were side-looks not so much of curiosity as recognition . student 's entry into Paris was a commonplace . The Paris townsilk knew too well this hungry eager look , this wondering smile - at soon enough would give way to the lifted brow and droop-g mouth , the signs of overbearing intellect . Oh , students were commonplace indeed to Paris . Menacing - affic they swung six abreast down streets not meant for more Ian a pair of horsemen ; impudent to tradesmen trying to serve iem honestly ; breakers of sleep with their loud songs and brawl ) g late at night , and , being tonsured clerks , beyond the reach f the king 's justice .

Flemings were slothful , fickle , ielding as butter ; Germans were foul-mouthed ; English were runkards . Indeed these last were worst of all , hiding their curled zils as they did beneath the fur-lined gowns they wore . So did Parisians keep the tally on the foreign clerks , although i truth they had the help of educated wit thus to record the list . or there was mutual love between the city and the schools as cell as mutual irritation . Some thirty years before that August day when Thomas stood efore the city gates , Paris had sheltered her first school of  | dialectics  --  that of the master , William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old basilica of Notre Dame . Ever since then these foreign students had poured in , lured by a call the townsfolk could not hear : the sweet and dangerous voice of Rationalism . For more than a millennium men had lived by Faith . Now , in the springtime of this century , Reason bloomed once more and Understanding was a flower , as in the age of reasonable Greece , much to be sought . Daring men , scholars and Churchmen , tried to express in rational human thought the doctrines of the Church received of God . The science of philosophy must wed theology . To others , more profound and cautious men , such union was unthinkable and dangerous . They spoke of heresy . Thus did the winds of controversy blow . And as dry leaves are sucked into the vortex of the rising whirlwind , students were drawn from every land into the heart of the scholastic world . Some of them came with ravening hunger of the mind and stayed on , unsated , year after threadbare year , studying , writing , arguing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garments , and at last their books , and finding solace finally in the more disreputable taverns or in the springtime on the roads of pilgrimage , sleeping with willing farm girls under a hedge , unkempt , wild , lost to the solid home or clerk 's bench from which they came , scholars forever in the free air of France . Others came more soberly to study dialectics and theology , to exercise already well-trained minds and seek advancement in the world . Thomas was one of these . As he picked up his pack and wound his way past stalls and money-changers over the bridge , pushing and being pushed , he saw that flags flew from the turrets of the castle , blue and gold against the golden sky , stretched on the evening breezes from the river . Below , in the hot stinking streets , there yet remained this festive feeling , like the feeling of the snapping flags . He wondered at this as he kept on along the narrow lanes  --  dark tunnels where the second stories of the houses met above his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holes of the doorways , and the smells of pigs and chickens from the slime beneath his feet . He had been told to keep right , by the wall , if  | ** find the hostelries for English students and lie came Into a little cobbled square crowded with people . c , who came behind him pushed him into those before he stood in the only place that lie was able to against the atone of a newbuilt church , his feet ash id. , the gutter next wall  --  while those in front of him leaned back upon him , on his feet , and sent the smells of sweat and garlic rd into his nose . Yet they were friendly people , apologizwhen they thrust an elbow inadvertently into his side or , aping to talk to one another , explored his ears with the long fathers of their hats . After a moment 's hesitation he asked in his OM courteous French why they were gathered here in this hot re . They turned to look at him and saw he was a stranger . many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accent unfamiliar , so that he had to catch their meaning bit hit . " . . . the old king dead . " That he already knew . Louis b Fat , the Wideawake , struggling in the heat of this unprec ! anted summer against his gross disease , had filially closed eyes and died . Thomas nodded in some uncertainty . " Young king mar . That also was well known . Even as the wise old king id labored against death the secret news was brought to him at his uneasy vassal to the south , the Duke of Aquitaine , Count Poitou , had died on pilgrimage and thus left unprotected as s heir the young unmarried Duchess Eleanor . Her lands spread nm the Loire almost as far south as the Pyrenees and from ie Bay of Biscay to Auvergne , wider and richer than those of is King of France himself . Whoever of the lords of Western mope could be the first to seize her hand would , by annexation her patrimony to his own estate , raise his domain to preninence over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , d son , his heir already crowned Louis VII , on quick-march Bordeaux where the girl duchess waited . Mild Louis , speedg from the bowstring of his dying father 's will , reached his . ie in mid-June and married her before the month was out . ing Louis lived to hear the news and then laid his huge body - a carpet strewn with ashes and departed from this world . Ins the young couple had returned to Paris as the summer - ded , King and Queen of France .  | " The queen rides out . . . " The fat man 's words were almost lost in a high silver trumpet blast , prolonged and beautiful above the rabble noise . The forerunners came shouting through the square , pushing the crowds back , and Thomas saw the particolored hoods of outriders as they jogged by and then the gilded top and painted velvet curtains of a litter . The crowd was disappointed , for they had grown accustomed these past days to seeing both the king and queen well-mounted and more dashingly escorted . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a royal court appealed to him . Two years ago in London he had seen the English court in its most lavish ceremonial parade when Stephen , Count of Blois , had himself crowned successor to his uncle Henry I. For that old king had died , as Richer 1'Aigle had dreaded that he might , while his grandson was yet an infant , two years old , playing with nursemaids in his mother 's court . And despite the old king 's wishes , despite the pledge that had been given him , the crown of England had been placed upon the head , not of his daughter Empress Matilda but of his sister 's son , Stephen of Blois . There had been unease in England , but most Londoners loved Stephen , and so did Thomas , then . For he was young , and pageantry  --  so lacking in the later years of the old Henry  --  thrilled him . Stephen , at his Christmas coronation , had seemed the flower of knighthood riding so splendid on his black horse through the snow . The present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed on some private visit amd chose the cover of a litter rather than ride openly . Nevertheless , her presence touched off cheering . Thomas glimpsed the gaudy palanquin and , as the heavy curtains swung , the head of a young girl . She was turned from him ; all he saw was the white floating corner of a wimple , a gleam of golden circlet , and an impression of a rounded brow and chin . Yet in that glimpse he sensed a warmth and vibrance . Now she was gone . The crowd broke and thinned behind her and Thomas saw a young man stagger in her wake , then kiss his fingers , fling them to the sky , and fall back with a dying swoon into the arms of his two grinning friends . They were students like himself and when he could make his way to them he stopped them to ask directions .  | Somewhat stiffly , he addressed them . They seemed to him to bear the mark of fellow-countrymen but they were older than he , their beards grown , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , and one had lost his teeth in some old wasting sickness or some brawl . He could not place them certainly , so he spoke to them in Latin , very politely , asking directions to the hostelry for English students which , so the canons of St. Paul 's had told him , was provided by the bounty of the French king . A quick look passed between the three , a hint of mockery , for this tall bony youngster with the courtly manner and the fierce black eyes , but they themselves had once known homesickness . They answered him in easy Norman French , accented as at home , and said that they would lead him to the hostel . So they walked four abreast , rubbing the dirt of housefronts on their sleeves as they swung , arms locked , down the lanes , squeezing aside for men of rank , pushing along without regard for lesser citizens . The slowly cooling evening air was full of many sounds : the screech of housewives to their children and the squeal of unoiled wheels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their lounging places , the cluck of chickens ; the sweet somber flow of plainsong when they passed a cloister door . To this the students added their own noise , their voices rising roughly as they tramped to the irregular rhythm of their song : the Andacavas Abbas . Thomas was probably the only man in Paris who did not know the ballad  --  since he had arrived scarcely an hour earlier . They taught it to him , that rousing paean to the Abbot of Angers who drank his wine all times and seasons , out of gigantic pots and pans , until , as hides are dressed and tanned with myrrh , so was his skin made black and leathery with wine . It was a stirring song , its rhythm staggering , so that they walked like drunken men in keeping time to it . Thus they arrived at Thomas ' hostelry , a narrow doorway in a narrow hall where young men came and went like bees into their hive . Thomas ' companions stopped their singing and let go his arms . They wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were no longer novice " yellowbeaks " to stay in hostels , but rented chambers of their own : an attic room above a tanner 's  | shop . But they were known here ; several of the young men at the door looked after them with admiration as they departed . The story had been told of them that once in a winter of desperation , when they were down to one cloak between them in which to attend their lectures , they lured a neighbor 's cat into their play at dice . The cat lost and was sent home with a note around his neck telling of his debt . The debt was paid , too , though the owner sent his own note asking that the cat be spared from further play because he could not count his throw . Because of this and similar stories the three were much admired , and some of this admiration was transferred to Thomas , as he stood slipping off his pack before the door . Thomas took up his life in Paris with the ease of youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room with crooked stairs and hall above , also for sleeping . Thomas had a wooden bed crammed in among the others and on the first night the students had accepted him and told him where to buy bedding and two new sheets  --  as he would find the white cloth helpful against lice  --  and the necessities of candles , all the waxed tablets he might need and stylus for his notes . Books he could rent . And there would be a senior student coming round to tell them of the various masters whose lectures he could hear , the fee for each , and where to register  --  though naturally if he had any sense he would choose Doctor Peter Abelard . They were all going to . Most famous of all the men who studied and then taught in Paris in those years of intellectual fire was Peter Abelard . His wit was sharp , able to move the minds of serious men to laughter , his character ambitious , and his mind far-ranging into the dangerous and unexplored . As a young student he outstudied and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon became a master on his own . He moved his school out of the crowded walks and courts of Notre Dame , across the little bridge of scholars onto the gentle slopes of Mont St. Genevieve . There students flocked to hear him lecture in the green orchards on the left bank of the Seine . But he made many enemies , powerful and dedicated men , who feared the questions he put into malleable minds . He was  | et.tisetl of heresy , found guilty , forced to burn his books and 1ve in exile from the centers of learning for many years . Now lie had returned , old , battered , and again harassed , but not yet quite defeated . Once more across the Petit Pont his siren voice vas heard inviting brash young men to rneasure God 's intent gainst the fragile logic of the human mind . ' Thomas had heard f him of course . Even in London schoolboys knew the lyric ungs the learned doctor wrote in those years of his passionate flair with the young lovely Heloise , the beauty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He somevhat feared his teaching , yet he knew he should not miss the opportunity to hear his famed discourse . Next day the senior student of whom the boys had spoken ame to the hostel . He was John of Salisbury , quiet and grave , who had been studying at Paris several years , this last one tnder Abelard , and was known as a scholar and a gifted writer f Latin prose . He had the boys bring him a chair and table ; he vas a slight man and to sit behind a table gave him more authority than to stand up . Then , with his base established , le listened smilingly , a little absently , while the new students old him their backgrounds and their interests . To a group of hem , including Thomas , he recommended Robert of Melun as a eacher and sobriety as a way of life . A student laughed and John looked up . " You think my admonition to live soberly is out of placer ' Under the quiet look the youngster 's laugh turned somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice of master gut of place . I would choose Master Abelard . " John 's face showed no expression . " Master Abelard has left , " to said . They did not believe him . Left for where ? And why ? " That he is gone is quite enough to know , " said John . " So they have hounded him out again ! " the brash young stulent shouted . " Who is it this time ? The bishop ? The metropolitan ? Or was it the all-holy unforgiving Abbot of Clairvaux again ? " Thomas was shocked . No one had ever spoken thus before ? is far as he had ever heard  --  about the Abbot Bernard of Clair- vaux . Thomas had always heard that if saints walked the earth this man was surely one . John brushed aside the question . " Therefore , " he said , " those of you bent on study of dialectics may join yourselves to Master Robert , as I said , or Master Alberic if you prefer . I mentioned Master Robert because he comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the young man cried again . " And what of Abelard ? " asked John . " What will you have me say of him ? That he is an illustrious teacher , better than any , admired by all who study with him ? I will say that . And that he has departed all too hastily from Paris ? That I will say . What more ? " " And we are not to have the privilege of hearing him ! " The hothead turned aside and he and others formed a little group and stood apart , discussing the feasibility of following Peter Abelard wherever he had gone . Paris was not the only place of study in the world ! But Thomas would not be beguiled by talk like this . His journey to the schools had not been after some vague ideal nor yet to swallow discourse that might be heretical . He came to study and to learn , to listen to advice and to advance himself . " And you , sir , " he spoke with great respect to John , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , " Who will you join , now that Master Abelard is gone ? " " I have attached myself to Master Alberic of Rheims , " John said . " Both he and Robert of Melun are good teachers , sharp of intellect  --  the one perhaps more subtle and profuse , the other lucid , brief , and to the point . Robert is more caustic in responses where Alberic may indicate that simple answers raise more serious questions . For you " ? he looked up from the desk at Thomas and the years between them seemed to grow ? " I would suggest Master Robert as being easier to follow . " Thomas , conscious of his youth , his newness , felt this was an insult . Yet , it was true ; he came to Paris to find answers rather than questions . He did not speak . " There is a difference of flavor , only , between the two , " John said placatingly . " Both are esteemed . You may choose English beer or French wine , as you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thomas said bluntly . The senior  | Student had an odd effect on him , making him awkward where with others he was smooth . John 's answer was to repeat the information he had come to roes the times and places of the lecture courses and the proper foes to pay . Then he arose to go . But as he passed by Thomas he looked up at him . He had a wide smooth brow and wide-set clear brown eyes , giving an air of deeper gravity than was , perhaps , indicative of his true character . " As for your beer and wine , " he said with a small smile , " choose what you find best . I myself am a drinker of both . " He looked back at the room where the young students hung in a bunch upon his sober words . " Nor do I abhor , " he added , " anything  --  as long as it can make me truly drunk . " Thomas paid his fee and joined himself to Master Robert of Melon as he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked across the city and the Petit Pont to the hall which had been hired by the learned dialectician for his lectures . The boys sat on the wooden benches under the master 's platform or , if they came late , upon the piled straw of the floor , and hung upon his words and memorized the rudiments of dialectic . Thomas remembered faithfully to hear Mass once a day and keep the vows that he had made at Merton . Winter came early . And as the summer had been hot beyond men 's memories , so were the dark months cold . Thomas put on his fur-lined robe under the scholar 's hooded gown he was required to wear and wrote home for more money to buy himself strong leather hose and heavy gloves , for he was always cold . By day the streets were crackling with frost , the eaves were hung with icicles . By night the hostel stank  --  the doors and shutters scaled against the wind , the young men wrapped in all their clothes and stale bed coverings , their frosty breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shivering they sat upon their beds to study , shuffling their feet in dirty straw , their aching fingers cupped around the candle 's glow . To Thomas , used as a child to all the warmth and plenty of his father 's hall , the lordly life at Pevensey , it was a gall to have to live thus as the poor boys lived who slept on naked straw and had to eke a living copying lessons or carrying holy water from  | the churches to stay in school at all . His heart went out to them as they stood shivering at the butcher 's stall and haggled for a piece of tripe or sausage while next to them , soaking in the smells of the rotisserie , the servant of some lucky fellow ordered roast goose , mutton done in garlic sauce , or pork pie hot with pepper . He would have liked a heavy purse so that he might buy for them , and for himself , all that their stomachs craved . But he must make his money stretch and live on soggy pastries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not keep him warm . Advent and Christmas and Epiphany came and went . Outside on deepest nights the icicles made eerie chimes and once or twice the gray wolves crept across the forest plains , through the lean suburbs into the cold black narrow streets . Thomas ' breath hung in the air before him and he looked for spring . With March the sap began to run , and blood to frozen fingertips . Within the lecture halls response was livelier to the master 's sallies ; students clapped and stamped upon the floor or hissed through their teeth at some disputed point . In streets now , going home , they sang . It was the time to play the tambourine , to follow pretty girls , to fall in love . From Thomas ' hostel came a plaintive song : " If she whom I desire should stoop to love me I would look down on Jove . If for one night my lady would lie by me And I kiss the mouth I love ... " Thomas pushed through the door and saw a group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singer with a lute . He realized they must be making ready for the Parliament d'Amour . Lent was not far away . " Innocent breasts , when I have looked upon them Would that my hands were there . . . " Serlon of Wilton sat with the lute across his knees , his eyes closed , singing . Thomas recognized him though he did not know him well ; everyone knew him by his reputation . He had no true friends , only hangers-on . Serlon had been in the schools for many years and all of Paris talked about him for the scandalous life he  | led  --  and also for the quickness of his mind and searching intellect . A brilliant and a dissolute man . The younger students , all of them yellowbeaks , were slumped around him on their beds , listening with weak smiles on their mouths . " How I have craved , and dreaming thus upon them Love wakened from despair . " Serlon broke off and put the lute aside . " That is enough . I must be gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though to keep him . " No , do n't detain me . " Serlon waved his hand . " Would you keep a lady waiting ? " He looked around him with arched brows . " It would be nice , though , if I could buy her something  --  a small favor . " Some of the boys dug in their purses and the coins disappeared up Serlon 's sleeve as though they burned his hands . He walked out , jaunty and disreputable , and Thomas noted as he brushed past him how the weary lines had settled on his face . He shrugged . The charity that he had sworn to did not reach as far as Serlon . Warin , a thin young man from Winchester , a yellowbeak like Thomas and one of his close friends , had taken up the lute . He sat upon the bed , his pointed knees stuck out before him , and plucked the strings . Now he threw his head back as he had seen Serlon do and sang a wavering phrase , his Adam 's apple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter long , " he sang in a high voice . " Now comes the wanton spring with song . Come , mistress mine .. . The others looked at him askance and someone groaned . Warin stopped and grinned , then plucked the strings again . " Thy virginity mocks my wooing ; Thy simplicity is my undoing . Come ... " William Bigod , sitting next to him , grabbed at the lute . " The words are n't his , " he said . " And anyway he has the tune all wrong . " " All right , you try , " said Warin amicably . Will took the lute and twanged it for a moment , frowning in fierce concentration . " This is the way it should go , it goes like  | this . " He coughed . " Like this : Patient have I been winter long . . . ' " His voice was very deep ; the tune he sang was not at all like Warin 's . He tried again . " Patient have I been winter long . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no patience . " Here , let me try . " " Let Warin try again . " " No . It 's no good . You have to have your own words in the parliament . " " Let Thomas try . " " Patient have I been winter long , " Will rumbled once again . " Let Tom try , " Warin said . He put his hand across the lute strings but William clung to it . Thomas laughed and shook his head . " I can not make a rhyme . " " It does n't matter ; neither can Warin . " " I tell you it 's no use , " smiled Thomas . " Truly , I can not make a rhyme . I ca n't take part . " " Sing one of mine . " Still Thomas shook his head . " I have no voice . " " He has a voice ! " " He sings out like a rooster in the dawn . I 've heard him ! " Thomas ' smile was fading . " I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why practice ? " William looked up from his laborious plucking at the strings . " Why not take part ? " he asked . " He has no lady love , " said Warin . " Tom is lady-shy . " " No more than you , " said Thomas . " But if I sing . . . " They would not let him finish . They were all laughing at him . " What , has he got the unnatural vice ? " asked William . His voice had not the lightness that the others ' had . " Is that the reason ? " He grinned round at the others . " That must be it . " The insult had no substance and the boys knew it  --  God knows they knew , in their cramped dormitory , which of them found their pleasure in other boys as well as they knew which ones snored , which young ones , sick for home and mother , sniffled beneath the covers in the dark , which were the ones most often driven to self-pleasure , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . They knew that Thomas was as much a man as any , but they knew also that he had a temper and that Will had roused it . Thus they sat grinning up at him while his face went red . Thomas , for all Lord Richer 's training , could not hide his tern- per when he was made the butt of jokes and he was angry now . He reached for William , meaning to jerk him from the bed , but Will dodged back . He swung again , hit Warin in the face and knocked him to the floor . It was a long fight but because it was within the hostel where all knew each other well and all were of one nationality , no knives or sticks were used and no one was seriously hurt . And afterward they all went to the Tavern of the Two Swords in the rue St. Jacques where all the students of the English nation went . They drew their wine and found a table . Warin , sitting next to Thomas , winced as he swallowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked at Thomas . " What was it all about ? " he asked . The easiest , since the fight had ended amicably and they were all together in the tavern and the wine not bad , would have been to let the subject go . For Thomas , ease of this sort was never possible . He said , " I tried to make the point  --  you would not hear me  --  that to sing of maids is unbecoming in a clerk . " Warin looked at him a long time and the friendly sparkle faded from his eyes . " To be a maid is unbecoming in a man , " he said . Thomas would have fought again but Warin was a thin frail boy , a good friend too . Instead he put his anger in his voice . " I took a vow of purity . And when I swore I did not do it lightly , with a smirk ! " It was a clumsy answer ; there was no wit in it and with its implication of superior virtue sure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew this . And what is more he knew quite well the way to please his fellows . Most of the time he practiced conscientiously those qualities that gathered others to him : wit and easy laughter in the summer months , fortitude in the dark days , and charity for those in need of it . He himself had need of their approval ; his whole soul thrived on popularity . But even more than this he had a need to speak out in the cause of what he was convinced was right . It was a sort of curse with him ; it made him appear ugly to his friends . And he was ugly now . " Oh " ? Warin 's voice was high and quivering with sarcasm ?  | " how praiseworthy it is to have such strength of will , how laudable to walk across the world in spring and never see the buds ! It happens , Tom , that I am not as pure as you  --  I have the sin of gratitude . I can never see a flower or a bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thank God for it . " " It is said , " said Thomas slowly , his face still glowering , " that the Abbot of Clairvaux once walked beside the waters of Lake Geneva and never raised his eyes to sky or mountain . Would you accuse the abbot of ingratitude to God ? " The others were all listening now , and Warin subtly shifted ground . If Thomas wanted to start formal argument , bringing in great authorities , he would quote Peter Abelard , the only source he knew to cite against the abbot . " I would say that God gave man eyes to see and hearts to feel . He gave the gift of mind , and of reason  --  just as he gave faith . " Thomas ' eyes snapped for he knew that he had won this first point . " Let me remind you of the Abbot Bernard once again , Warin , since you have taken pains to remind me of Master Abelard : Is our faith a matter of private judgment ? Is every man , in these great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tongue pleases ? " ' The others recognized the words ? written by Bernard to the pope and much discussed in Paris . Thomas was claiming for his side the two great pillars of the Church who stood in mutual support of one another . There was no authority , not Aristotle nor the saints themselves , who could be used against them . They listened , downcast , for they all took Warin 's side , while Thomas finished : " Is not , then , our hope baseless if our faith is subject to idle inquiry ? " He drank his wine . It was a victory but not a pleasing one . To be the first to cite the best authority , that was the way to win debate . Thomas had done it ; Warin had not . As a result , though , they all resented him  --  and their original difference was unresolved . Warin was silent for a moment . Then he said querulously , dropping all pretense of formal argument , " What has faith got to do with singing songs ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas , " we must accept our vows .  | " I never took a vow not to sing songs , " Will Bigod growled , its eyes fixed on his cup . " You should have , " someone said . But no one laughed . " You took a vow of chastity , " said Thomas stubbornly . " Ca n't I be chaste , " asked Warin with his thin voice rising on the question , " and still sing songs ? " Around the table all were silent , those who were chaste and hose who were unchaste . They all knew what these spring-songs meant . Then Thomas answered , staring at his cup . " It 's possible . " He knew that many students , chaste as himself , claimed as heir own , composed love poems for , some lady of high birth whom they had glimpsed as she sat at a window or perhaps crossing a street with skirts so delicately lifted up and neck outstretched before her like a swan . It was , he knew , a novel and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commit oneself to some fair matron-unattainable . But he himself had not the inclination for it , or perhaps not quite the ardent innocence required  --  as , it seemed , Warin had . More frequently , he knew , when students sang of budding breasts they were the breasts of tavern women or of country girls ? breasts they knew well and what the fondling of them did to a man . Thomas himself had known , those years in London , the feel of a maiden 's mouth against his own and her soft body next to his all the night long  --  though he had never known this rapture without self-denial ; he had kept the letter of his vow . And when they parted , he and those sweet and yielding girls , fumbling and whispering in the dawn , they were still virginal . But the experience had left him with an understanding of himself ; he was as easily roused as any other man . And when he came to Paris and saw temptation all about him he had resolved to keep himself from such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more sober of his masters and the monks at Notre Dame . Thus he escaped the  --  side glance from the wimple coyly twitched aside , the coarse words and suggestions of the prostitute , the downcast quivering eyelids of the milk-faced girl in church . In truth , he had not found it was so very hard to do if he was careful , strictly self-disciplined , and with God 's help . " Perhaps it 's possible , " he said once more . He sounded tired and old . " I see no reason to attempt it . "  | Thomas did not attend the Parliament d'Amour that year . He took his problem to John of Salisbury asking wise counsel : whether it was proper for clerks to sing of love and whether , if he thought not , scholars should hold a parley of this sort . John 's answer was a question : " In what way is it your concern ? " And when he saw the flash of temper in Thomas ' eyes he smiled and added , " I agree with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school here nor yet a canon of the church , authority to censure fellow students was not given me . As for myself , if I decide that I love poetry more than I hate lascivious display ? there will be some of each  --  why then I will attend . If I decide the other way , why I 'll stay home . " But as for you , Tom , " John 's clear eyes were slightly mocking , though he smiled , " why , I should say you ought to stay away ? at least until you learn to bank those admirable fires of your righteous indignation . " It was the next year that the scandal which involved him broke at the parley . John was no longer there to be his friend and older brother ; he had gone on to study and to teach at Chartres . And the story of Thomas ' views on chastity  --  heightened and made ludicrous in the retelling  --  had gone the rounds till Serlon heard of it . Next year when the Parliament d'Amour came round he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank as well as whores and tavern women and the shy nieces of the canons who lived near the schools . That winter he had been kept warm by the dull wife of a city magistrate and when spring came he felt the need of laughter and fresh air . He decided to bring to the parliament , which he had won so often , a touch of the bizarre . Therefore he borrowed from the magistrate 's wife a bishop 's chasuble she was embroidering and polished up new verses , keeping them secret . The place the students held their parley was on the left bank near the Petit Pont . They made a stage there , placing it aloft on stilts between two cypress trees and backing it with painted canvases tacked at the corners so that they would not fly away . The wind blew from the river and the hangings flapped and bel- . , d and the stage swayed like some queer ship that might uplot her anchor any moment and sail away for Mont St. Geneeve . The first contestant stood upon the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore a strange embroidered collar that sted on his shoulders and hung down in pointed tufts on either an . He was so conscious of this gaudy cowl made by some dulled city girl , patting and arranging it , that it caused more cornrent than his song  --  for that was not worth comment of any sort . The others stood below the stage on softly sloping ground here wet leaves glistened and the smell was strong of last year 's ) liage and fungus in the wood . The tiny pale-green shoots of ) ring were just appearing . The contestants and their various ! agues  --  for each had brought along a group of friends of his wn nation  --  watched the stage and listened critically . It took a caster singer or a verse of some distinction to keep them quiet . 1therwise they moved about and talked among themselves or ven hooted at the stage to get the singer off . Thomas stood among them in his double cloak . He had come my as a member of the English claque formed to support a cadent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if any quesoned him . He told himself it caused less comment that he came Zan if he stayed away . He was prepared never to speak again f the old argument if others were prepared to let it be . The first poor specimen was hustled off and a Bavarian student ) ok his place , stolid in bearing but with the freshness of the seam caught in the skipping rhythm of his Latin verse . He sang Tithout accompaniment : " The earth lies open-breasted In gentleness of spring , Who lay so close and frozen In winter 's blustering . Sweet it is to wander In a place of trees , Sweeter to pluck roses And the fleur-de-lys . But dalliance with a lovely lass Far surpasses these .  | If she for whom I travail Should still be cold to me , The birds sing unavailing , ' T is winter still for me . " There was a roar of approval among the Germans . Their man had touched on all the popular themes : spring , the hope of dalliance , and of love spurned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same subjects . They praised their ladies ' purity and swooned for love , each new contestant echoing the one before  --  till Serlon stepped upon the stage . Here was the master , and the audience stood still . He looked at them , his face quirked in a small contemptuous smile . And suddenly he played a strange and jarring chord and launched into a jesting song that mocked the lovesick verses that had gone before : " I would have a man live in manly fashion . Yes , I shall love , but given an equal passion . I know not how to pray In the old vulgar way . Would she have me love her ? Then shall she first love me ! " He paused . They laughed uneasily and clapped their hands , but they were puzzled . Serlon looked at them . Then he began again : " Alas , alas , what is it I have sung ? My song is all a lie , I am undone .. Worthy am I of all thy cruelty , I do confess my guilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chamber my tribunal be ! " This time they laughed more heartily and stamped and called for more while Serlon laughed with them . They liked his wit , but better his siren lyrics of seduction . They called for favorites . " Give us ' Who knows honey 's sweet who tastes it not , ' " one of his friends called out . But Serlon shook his head . " I have a friend , " he said , " who wrote a song but will not sing it . He is shy . They say he 's chaste as Daphne . But you will see , he knows the pulse of love . "  | The audience fell quiet and Serlon took a pose familiar to them , with one knee thrust forward under the lute , his head thrown back and eyes half-closed , suggesting languor and the pangs of love . The song was subtle and his voice infused it with suggestion . He sang of sleep , of sleep like a soft breath from fields of ripening grain , like murmuring of shallow water over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sleep that follows love . . . . " After love 's gentle commerce , Languor , soft repose . The brain swoons after such delights , The eyelids close . Oh sweet the passing o'er from love to sleep , But sweeter the return from sleep to love . Under the assenting trees Where nightingales their questions cry How good it is to lie at ease .. . But better with a maid to lie In the tall grass where scented herbs Mingled with roses softly sigh And after the exchange of love Lure us to sleep . Our senses fly , Instilled in lassitude . Oh sweet the passing over from love to sleep , But sweeter the return from sleep to love ! " A murmur of appreciation and recognition  --  not of the words but of their own dreams  --  ran through the students before they broke into applause . Thomas , among them , felt in himself the old ache and the swelling of desire . There in the softly springing grass , languorous , playing . . . time to depart and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He knew , he knew . He longed for it . And then into this dream  --  while he was open , vulnerable  --  came the joke . Serlon , holding up his hands , cried , " Silence ! Would you know the author 's name ? He must forgive me if I tell it : Thomas of London ! " Thomas felt his own name strike him like an arrow in the heart . The blood ebbed from his face , leaving him almost sight- less while it pounded in his chest . He looked around him , blank , face grim , and saw the laughter : teeth , open mouths , the questioning eyes . For once he had no answer . He turned and with a long and furious stride walked from that place , his cloak pulled round him , never looking back .  | ON THE LAST DAY of the parliament , when the contestants brought their tokens , sewed by their ladies as they claimed , Serlon spread out in display the bishop 's chasuble that he had borrowed , claiming again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasped  --  for it was Serlon 's weakness that he carried things too far  --  and when word reached the masters , scandal broke . Serlon took everything upon himself , absolving Thomas , and was contrite and did his penance . Because he was respected among his masters for his scholarship as he was known among the students for his songs , much was forgiven him . The incident was closed . And he and Thomas , brought together in the tavern , at last took pains to understand each other and each forgive the other for their differences , and learn from one another that each could laugh , and they were friends . But this friendship did not grow , nor any other of Thomas ' plans for his next years at Paris , for it was soon after this the message came for him , calling him home . His mother , so the letter read , lay dying , and his father needed him . He must return . The messenger who brought the news brought also news of king and country  --  the sort that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was an elderly clerk called Edmund Up , doorkeeper at St. Paul 's , and he had come to Paris in the escort of a canon who was on business for the Church . Edmund had known Thomas as a boy and he spoke kindly to him concerning things at home while Thomas , holding the letter in his hand , sat silent on his bed . What was written there was sad , he knew that , he had seen Thomas ' father , he had been told . But what could not he written ? that was a burden on the heart as well . They had better go  | and sit somewhere  --  Edmund rubbed a dry hand over his face and glanced around the hostel  --  where they could talk anc where he could report to Thomas all that he knew , for Thomas was a man now and should not be spared . So Thomas led him to a tavern for the English and selected a dark corner where he could sit and hear of home and none should see his face . Edmund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his face or pausing between sentences to open wide his mouth and smooth his cheeks and beard , It was a nervous habit that he had , and in a little while Thomas stopped looking at him and gazed off across the room . " Things are not the same in England as when you were there , ' said Edmund . " Perhaps you 've heard ? " " We 've heard some things , " said Thomas absently . " The king 's turned soft , " Edmund said very quietly . " And treacherous men rebel against him . Some of the barons have made their castles strong against him and take the law into their hands so that there is no law where they rule , only lawlessness . " He glanced around and then leaned over farther on the table . " A man came into London from out by Hereford and said the baron with his men had come into his village and carried off the sheep and then set fire to the houses and the land around and took the villagers for ransom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And after that . . . " Edmund 's hand went rapidly over his face from forehead down to chin . " After that they went into the town and right into the churchyard where they carried off the chattels that the country folk had brought there for safekeeping . They went into the bishop 's own cathedral and seized the sacred goods and drove the monks away and turned the church into a fort ... " Thomas looked at Edmund now , and Edmund nodded . " Aye , they made of it a fort so that they might attack the castle of the king nearby . A garrison of fighting men into the choir , a catapult into the bell tower . Aye , and they dug up the graveyard to make earthworks ! The man who told us said the townsmen cried aloud to see the bodies of their forefathers ? some of them only lately buried , some half-rotten , all dug up from their graves and flung aside ! " " What has the king done ? " Thomas asked .  | " What can he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these barons down others rise up behind him . And when the bishops threaten them with excommunication and anathema they laugh . What does it mean to them ? They are all cursed already , and foresworn and lost . " " What of my father and my mother ? " Thomas asked . " Is it as you say in London also , lawless , and at the mercy of these lawless men ? " " In London we are many , " Edmund said . " We are strong together and no one touches us . But food is scarce  --  grain , cheese , and butter very dear . Some go hungry . Even some wretched men who once were rich must ask for alms to feed their families . They come in numbers to St. Paul 's . It is a job for me ! " He pushed his fingers in his eyes , then looked at Thomas . " But your father is all right . He is a man with many friends and does not want . And we are in no danger in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thomas asked suddenly . " The letter does not say . " Edmund drew away and looked at him , his hands for once upon the table . " Why , I do n't know , " he said . " How long does she have yet to live ? " Now Edmund seized his face in both his hands and rubbed it hard . He did not like the question . " Why , I do n't know , " he said again . " I am no leech . " Thomas saw he must explain himself . " You think me very hard of heart , " he said . " You think that even now I should be on my way instead of sitting here . " He paused . " I will defend myself . My father gave me the last of his small treasure , skimping my sister 's dowry , to send me here for education . My mother blessed me when I left , instructing me to turn aside for nothing , nothing , till I should master what there is to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more weeks the schools will close ; I will have had two years of study under famous men . It 's not enough , I will not be a master as my mother wished . But it will be two years . . . " Now comes this message from my father , Son , your mother longs to look on you before she dies . ' What does my mother say ? " Edmund did not know . He had not seen her , only Gilbert when he came to St. Paul 's looking for some person who was traveling  | to Paris . " Why , I do n't know , " he said for the third time . It seemed to come as a surprise to him to know so little . " You must make your own choice , I will take your message back to London if that is how it is to be . " So Thomas chose , and sent word he would meet his father 's steward Ebert  --  for he had strong instructions not to attempt the trip alone , no man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sandwich late in June , as soon after Corpus Christi as he could manage . Ebert was waiting at the waterside , wiry-thin and older , his pale straight hair no longer gold but gray . He embraced Thomas , letting his tears fall on the tall shoulder , as they stood upon the mud-washed cobbles of the landing place . He told the news of home : times were very hard but Gilbert Becket managed to provide and Thomas ' mother wanted for nothing . But she would not last long , not long , for she was wasting badly and the time was gone when she could rise and be about the house . She lay abed and they must even prop the bedclothes up lest with their weight they crush her wasted bones . The doctors came and went and drank up all the wine , but she was beyond their art . Roheise came every day to see her mother and to cheer her  --  she was a fine cheerful matron now with her own firstborn on the way already plain to see . And they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young , to please her mother , that all should be well settled . They waited only for the son 's return . Eagerly Thomas spoke of setting off at once , they could reach Canterbury by night . Having delayed in Paris these two months he could not bear to wait another day . Ebert was cautious , arguing that they must join themselves to some large party on the road . Brigands were everywhere . Men traveling alone were kidnaped , held for ransom , murdered . Thomas knew only one thing , that he must go home . He overruled all Ebert 's pleas and warnings and they took their horses and set off along the London road between the summer fields . It was on the second day , when the road took them through a stretch of woods as they neared Rochester , that Ebert suddenly reached out and clutched at Thomas ' arm and whispered that he had seen horsemen on the road , just round the bend . " I  | saw them through an opening in the trees . Come quicidyl " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frantic kicks and slaps , up the soft dirt of the embankment into the shelter of the underbrush and trees . Thomas followed , half-amused , halffearful . But he halted and would go no farther when he felt they were well-screened . He wanted to stay close enough to watch the road . Ebert slipped from his horse and put his hand upon its nose , hoping to silence it if it should whinny at the sight of other horses and , whispering still , he ordered Thomas to do likewise . Thomas smiled , dismounted , and took his horse 's head . All these precautions made him feel a fool . And he laughted outright when he saw the men upon the road : three sober clerks on quiet palfreys ambling round the bend . He would have stepped into the open and hailed them to exchange the news , but Ebert clasped him and hissed in his ear : " No , no . You do not understand . This is how brigands go about these days . This is their way ! No longer do they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many people have grown wary these last years . Now they ride openly in daylight on the well-worn roads , like these below . They wear false clothes . . . " Thomas was doubtful , looking down on the unwary men sitting so slovenly . But Ebert 's words continued to flow from him in an agony of earnestness . " Be quiet , oh I beg of you . You do not understand . This , this is their disguise , their very counterfeit by which to know them . They keep their daggers hidden beneath that downcast look and modest way . . . " He would have jabbered on but he had left his horse untended when he turned to plead with Thomas and it moved now , crackling the underbrush and snorting as the dust rose to its nostrils . Down in the road the three men heard the noise . Three faces turned to stare into the woods , their mouths open in surprise and fear . Then in one motion they turned back , gathering their reins in shaking hands , flapping their legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they galloped off pursued by their own dust . Thomas ' laugh broke loud , so ludicrous they looked , so foolish he and Ebert seemed . But then he turned to make amends to Ebert , for it was clear now what had happened since he went  | away . No longer did man trust himself to man with the old confidence . Instead , in daylight , on the king 's highway , they trembled when they sighted one another and hid away or fled in terror down the road . He saw , now , how it was with England . And he could have wept , remembering how fearlessly he used to ride alone in old King Henry 's time . Soberly the two led forth their horses from the wood and mounted and rode on for London . Thomas knelt beside his mother 's bed and heard her prayers for him . But he could not be sure she knew that he was there . The priest was often with her , an old man wise in necromancy , and he seemed to comfort her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word , while the soft air brought scent of new mown hay into the sun-filled solar . Her daughters came  --  Mary from Barking , Roheise from her new home near at hand  --  and Agnes , still a child , was there . They laid out their mother under Alfleda 's guidance . Then she was buried and the girls returned , Agnes to Roheise 's house , and Thomas and his father were left alone . " I will be going soon myself , " his father said . But Thomas surmised that all men said this when their wives , whom they had loved , were dead . Friends came to fill the hall and bring some comfort to the lonely men . They were impressed by Thomas , said he had turned out well , as , let it be remembered , they predicted . What would he do now ? " I have already spoken to my kinsman Osbert Huit-deniers , " said Gilbert . And to Thomas : " Son , you should know your cousin takes a leading part in the affairs of London and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Michaelmas folkmoot . " In these past years the burgesses of London had been granted a new freedom by King Henry : the right to choose their own justiciar who was the royal representative in town affairs and pled the Crown pleas in the city courts . He was a man of more importance , even , than the sheriff . Now , Gilbert said , the aldermen and rich men of the city were prepared to give this office to the wealthy merchant Osbert . If he were chosen he would need a clerk . And a man trained in Paris , and a trusted cousin , would be more than welcome .  | After Michaelmas the great bell of St. Paul 's rang out in summons to all citizens of standing to attend the folkmoot and be shown their sheriff , hear his commands , and to accept their new justiciar : Osbert Huit-deniers . Osbert was a large man , portly and full of dignity . He wore a wide hat and a robe of crimson velvet girdled with gold and a large golden bawdrike round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church steps , facing the square , and raised his hands and spoke in a loud voice with great solemnity about the troubled times and his determination as a Londoner to keep the king 's peace in the city . The crowd was with him , but it was a ticklish business , for it was known to some that he held a knight 's fee from the Earl of Gloucester , brother of the Empress Matilda . And at the very time Osbert was speaking to the folkmoot as the king 's representative  --  September 29 , 1139 ? the empress with her brother Gloucester landed in England to make war against the king . But this news had not reached London . Osbert was installed , set up his court , and graciously included Gilbert Becket 's son among his clerks . And a new life began for Thomas . The empress and her brother made their way to Bristol and from there launched many bloody raids against the cities of the west . All through the winter of 1139 , the spring and summer of 1140 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that year the knight 's fee that he held of Gloucester became too great a handicap for Osbert , and his friend Gervase of Cornhill was selected as justiciar , replacing him . Still Osbert was a powerful man in London and he remained one of the inner group whose words were listened to in council . And Thomas , invaluable to him now not only for his ability to read and write but for his gifts of everyday diplomacy and swift decision , stayed with him . The summer of 1141 was the decisive one for London . Stephen , to whom the city was still loyal , had been captured by the empress and put in chains . Then she had ridden south to Winchester to claim the royal treasure and the crown . There she arrived in royal dignity , flanked by her brother Robert , Earl of Gloucester and her uncle David , King of the Scots , leading an army of their combined men . And there she confronted Stephen 's  | brother , Henry , Bishop of Winchester and papal legate , " lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said that she would have of him the crown . The wily bishop made a bargain : she should leave all ecclesiastical affairs to him ; he would arrange she be elected to the throne . And publicly , in the town marketplace , he showed her deference and instructed all to call her queen . She in return spoke haughtily to him and spread her insolence even to her brother and her uncle Scotland  --  though he be a king . And when these three great men came to her chair with bended knee she did not rise as would have been becoming . Nor did she listen when they bowed before her with petitions but often and again sent them away rebuffed with arrogant answers to their good advice and soft requests . The bishop hid his feelings in his beard and waited to see what end such a beginning would have . Nevertheless , with Stephen in her prison and his forces scattered , there was none to stop her . Soon she brought the greater part of England under her dominion , receiving homage from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In April , there in Winchester , she was elected queen . As Osbert 's clerk Thomas went with the London deputation to the ceremonies , watching with keen eyes and remembering all . The Londoners stood out alone against the empress , reiterating loyalty to Stephen , but they were ignored and overridden by the great magnates and shortly were dismissed . They had been ineffectual and overbold , perhaps , but they rode home with dignity , feeling proud . The empress gave out word that she would receive the crown in London , at Westminster as the ancient custom dictated , on St. John 's Day , midsummer . Wise men who understood the dangerous uncertainties of time argued against so long a wait ? for the election did not make her queen ; only the coronation could do that  --  but as in all other things she would not listen to advice . She laughed at the reports that Stephen 's queen had raised an army from Boulogne , was strengthening it in Kent . The empress knew this weak and womanly queen of Stephen 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tears , begging her husband 's freedom . No , Stephen 's wife was not the sort who could lead formidable armies .  | The clay before midsummer , then , the empress came to Westminster accompanied by the earl her brother and the king her uncle and many other lords but without her army . She set up silken tents among the gray old buildings of the palace and the church beside the Thames . It was a festive scene , the gardens at the fullness of their flowering , the water sparkling , and she herself arrayed in bright green silk and heavy gold embroidery . There was one bit of business yet to complete before the coronation : the consent of the London citizens . Afterward all could be feasting and gay celebration . And for this business she commanded that her chair be set up on a purple dais in the huge empty Rufus Hall , named for her father 's brother , William II . Then she sent messengers requiring that the burgesses of London wait upon her there . " Tell them to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind his kinsman 's chair while Osbert and Gervase of Cornhill and the other city magistrates held their despairing conference . " What is to be done ? " asked Osbert heavily . Everyone knew the answer to his question , it was as unavoidable as Doom : they must accept the empress as their queen . But there were arguments , factors to reconsider before they would admit defeat . Thomas knew them all . He had rehearsed them several times for Osbert whose reluctant mind was slow to understand the facts . And they were these : London could raise an army of some thousands but not soon enough or strong enough to march against the empress alone . They could not hope the army raised by Stephen 's queen would join them ; it was still a nebulous grouping of French and Kentish men , unformed . Had they the stronghold of the Tower of London on their side they might resist the empress and withstand a siege . But Geoffrey de Mandeville , Earl of Essex , whom they hated and who hated them , was constable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he was victorious he had allowed himself , on the king 's downfall , to be bought . London could not withstand a siege while in her very heart the enemy sat in his Tower .  | Reviewing all these facts for Osbert , Thomas had seen for himself and thus advised  --  reluctantly ; he would have liked to fight ? " There is no hope . We must submit . " Now , at the council , Gervase the Justiciar made the decision for them all , speaking these same words : " There is no hope . Tomorrow , as the empress demands , we must go to Westminster and pay her humble duty . " It was a perfect summer day and in the unmarked oval of the sky the small soft clouds sat airily like cherubs , above the earth . The delegation of five somber men , their clerks , their standard bearers , rode at a walk . The people eyed them as they passed out of the city and along the strand , wondering what these magistrates would do . Many among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the staller of his ward ? his captain should it come to battle  --  and to arm himself . Thomas could feel what they were thinking , for his own desire to fight still rankled under the cool decision reason had forced upon them . After a little while he did not look around him but rode with head bent till they reached the palace at Westminster and dismounted in the court . The empress received them in the Rufus Hall , immense and dark , a cavern of a hall . After the glare of sunlight Thomas could see nothing but the paving at his feet stretching away to blackness . A sergeant stamped his mace upon the floor and they were ordered to go forward . Only then , as he walked haltingly behind the magistrates , did he perceive the empress at the farther end , seated upon a dais with her retinue about her . He saw that she looked thin and somewhat worn . Her thick and tawny hair which she displayed without a wimple had lost its luster with the years . But she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a man . And she surveyed them in kingly silence as they knelt before her throne . At last she said , " You are the men that London sends to honor me ? I bid you welcome . " She seemed to swallow down the phrase . But her next words were strong and clear . " I will receive of you , you men of London , the sum of five hundred pounds in tallage to your queen . " Thomas saw the shock of this go through the men before him ;  | he could read dismay in Osbert 's heavy shoulders and Gervase 's thin back . Five hundred pounds was more than they could raise . Even in good years , and with the freedom granted by King Henry , the sum that London offered the royal exchequer was less than three hundred pounds . And this year .. . Gervase of Cornhill spoke for them . " Domina , " he faltered , for this was the title she now held . " Imperatrix , " the empress corrected him . " Imperatrix , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of its accustomed wealth owing to strife within the kingdom . Famine has threatened our poorer citizens and now we find ourselves reduced to the extremity of want . Otherwise we would most gladly raise the sum . But as it is , may we make dutiful and humble mention of the charter granted to our city by your father our most gracious king . . . " " You are very impudent , " the empress broke in , " to mention privileges and charters to me when you have been foremost in support of those who are my enemies ! You need say no more of charters or the extremity of want . " Gervase was silent . What could he say next , caught as he was between anxiety and outrage . And in the silence the Earl of Gloucester leaned beside his sister 's chair and spoke into her ear . She did not answer and the earl straightened and addressed the delegation very civilly . " You citizens of London , styled as in the old days barons , as we know , have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your great city to our support . And now that you have given honor to the empress as your queen , we ask that you pay tallage as you are able . " Thomas saw Gervase nodding in relief . A moment could be bought . " We beg your leave , " he asked the empress , " to withdraw , so that we may hold council in our own hall and deliberate how we can raise the sum . " " Five hundred pounds , " the empress said . Again they stood in silence and again the earl bent down . " You have my leave to go , " she said at last , staring above their heads . They held their council in the hustings hall and all the aldermen were present , questioning , discussing , until well after dark .  | But nothing new was said . Matilda would be queen ; she would not keep her father 's promises to London ; five hundred pounds could not be raised  --  but must be . The alderman from Farringdon Without said that the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded , but they were reminded that the Earl of Essex held the tower as it were a knife against their backs . So late they broke up , gloomy , and went home . Thomas , back in Osbert 's house beside the river , went up the loft stairs to the little room where he slept with the other clerks . Godwin , the merchant 's secretary-clerk , was looking out the window at the soft-smelling summer night , the river running peacefully below . " What is that little light in Southwark ? " he asked Thomas when he came to stand beside him . " There on the other bank ? " " It is a fire , " Thomas said . " And there 's another . Farther down , " said Godwin . The lights leaped up and spread , till they could see the very flames jumping and throwing sparks into the night . " And yet another  --  right down by the bridge ! " Thomas gripped Godwin 's arm . The other clerks came crowding to the window . Now they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger far away , and flames had spread to many points . It even seemed that they could smell the smoke . " Someone is burning the crops and houses ! Someone is harrying the land ! " Thomas turned and bolted down the narrow stairway to find Osbert . In the hall he saw Gervase push through the door followed by his men . " Someone is burning . . . " Thomas said to him . " Osbert Huit-deniers ! " Gervase commanded at the same time , as he had commanded at the door . And Osbert came in running from his chamber , his heavy face dismayed . Gervase ' gripped him by the arms to steady him . " King Stephen 's army has reached Southwark ! " he said in a shaken voice . " They are burning crops and houses . They are taking people with the sword . " " Why . . . " asked Osbert , not yet awake to what was happening .  | " A messenger came to my house just now . He brought the word . Stephen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are harrying our lands . " " Why do they spoil our lands ? " asked Osbert still perplexed . " We have been true to Stephen . " " They heard we made submission to the empress . " Gervase still gripped his arms . " They think we have gone over . Do n't you understand ? " " Are there many men among them ? " Osbert stared back at him . " It is an army . Stephen 's queen is with them . And they are captained by William of Ypres . " " William of Ypres . " The fact shot into place in Osbert 's mind and all was clear to him at last . " Why then it is an army ... " and his face changed while he looked in Gervase 's eyes and saw the hope beginning there . . . " Strong enough to hold the Tower do you think ? " " We must negotiate , " said Gervase . Thomas knew every turning of the negotiations , heard the word sent out to every alderman and staller of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every embassy depart to row across the river  --  for the city gates were shut , the bridge was guarded ; helped to compose the letters in their proper terms when the justiciar spoke the gist of them aloud . Paris had not trained his hand for elegant copying , but that was not of such importance now as clear decisive thought coupled with delicacy of presentation . In these he proved his value . Slowly the night went by . From time to time some of the aldermen , keeping to the shadows of the streets , had come to join them in their deliberations . When the dawn came , early summer dawn , the faces of the magistrates were gray ; some slept , their chins upon their beards . They were not young men to withstand a night of waiting and of doubts , of fearful hopes , without a fainting of the spirits and the blood . Thomas sat with the other clerks behind their table , resting with his arms stretched out before him but with eyes open and his mind awake . He heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was up . He heard the bells for Prime ; fresh daylight filled  | the hall . The sleepers stirred . But still nobody spoke and still they waited . At last the knock upon the door , the messenger returned . Thomas and the other clerks rose as he passed their table . They saw the letter he had taken from beneath his cloak ; it bore the queen 's own seal . Thomas knew even then , seeing the letter and the bearer 's face , that they had won their point and that his own hand and his mind had helped to change the destinies of thousands . The justiciar 's chief clerk and secretary left Thomas ' side and went to stand behind his master 's chair . And Gervase , breaking the heavy seal and spreading the letter on the table , stared at it while the clerk murmured the contents in his ear . Then he rose and looked around the room  --  the tired men past middle age who with him ruled the city and with him spent this night and morning of decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now do I thank you all , " he said . " And God be our judge , I think we have done right . " The others , knowing what would come , stood up . The faces even of the oldest of them were alert , untroubled . " William of Ypres , with Stephen 's army , will occupy the city and surround the Tower . The men of London must drive off the empress . " He stared a long time at them and they nodded . " Then sound the tocsin now ! Let every man take arms as he is trained , and come full speed to Ludgate . We will take Westminster today ! " Thomas saw Osbert coming toward him across the hall with arms outstretched and his broad face all wet , for he had given way to tears . Others ran from the room to spread the word abroad . And even as the merchant clasped him , murmuring senseless words in his excitement , then turned away to grasp the next man in his arms , Thomas heard the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , head up , and listened as the other bells across the city took up the alarm  --  the voices of St. Trinity ... St. Martin 's . . . each in its own tongue . . . the sweet peal of St. Mary Colechurch where he had been born , he knew it well .. . Loud did they ring , each clanging bell . Then came the deeper tolling of St. Paul .  | Laughing , he grabbed the long skirts of his scholar 's gown and ran with leaping strides across the hall and down the stairs into the street below . The empress was dining in her tent . She had brought with her excellent men from France to prepare her meals and this was to be a feast of some proportions , second only to her coronation feast to which she summoned all the great lords of her realm . The tent was very gay , with silken hangings on all sides and carpets softening the flagstones of the ancient Saxon court . Her brother Gloucester sat with her on one side and her uncle Scotland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the tallage that they owed . But while they waited they would feast . One of her sergeants came in hastily from the far end . He caused commotion for he came , careless of what lords or courtiers he passed , through the long tables set below to the high seat where the empress sat . There he went on one knee before her and exclaimed , even before she gave him leave to talk : " Imperatrix , there is a noise from London like a hive of bees , and the bells ring ! " She sat nonplused at this incomprehensible outburst but the Earl of Gloucester understood . " Are these alarm bells ? " he demanded . " Are these what make the sound of bees ? Make yourself clear . " " It is the church bells , sire . They ring out all at once , a clamor . I would take it for a tocsin , sire . It is an alarm of some sort . So I would interpret it . " The earl rose . The King of Scotland had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come , " the earl said to his uncle . " Let us hear these bees . " And they took their leave with speedy ceremony and left the tent . Out in the court they saw the guards standing atop the crumbling walls , staring toward London , and Gloucester called to one of them . He turned and jumped down and , like a man in battle , neglecting the obeisance of peacetime knowing it would be overlooked , spoke without preamble as man to man . " There is a sound as of a giant crowd , a mob , sir , " said the  | guard . " And I was just now watching a lone horseman , seemed to be galloping this way in haste . " " Robert , " said the King of Scots aloud , for he too was a man of battle , unashamed to speak his thoughts at such a time , " if this is an uprising of all London we must perforce withdraw . We have no more than two hundred armed men with us and this castle offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And this was true , for the old palace and its walls , even King Edward 's abbey , had been allowed to rot under King Stephen 's rule . " If it is a rising , " Earl Robert answered , unconvinced . " How could they dare rise , those fat burgesses , under the nose of Geoffrey de Mandeville , and no hope of aid from anywhere ? " His answer came from the horseman who rode through the gate . He was brought forward by the guards , a slim , small man , a weaver , panting and somewhat frightened , usually a man of peace and quiet but now , for some small reason of his own , angry with London and thus loyal to its foes . He told the story clearly enough , that Stephen 's queen was entering the town by London bridge and that armed men of London , uncounted thousands strong , had rallied at Ludgate and soon  --  even now ? were marching from the city against Westminster . And around them gathered a howling mob . " God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the earl said angrily , half to himself . " Stephen 's queen in London and the town against us ! William of Ypres is with her , you can be sure of that . " He turned away . " Our armies spread from Bristol all the way to Oxford  --  and none here ! " He found the empress where he had left her , anger in her scowling face , and without ceremony told her bluntly they must fly . There was no choice . William of Ypres could easily contain de Mandeville in the Tower , and all of London marched against the empress ' person . The sergeant brought their swiftest horses ; there had been no need to tell him what to do . They mounted and the lady empress with her two kinsmen , escorted by their closest guards , fled from the palace and along the road to Oxford . Behind her all the other lords who had attended her , waiting the coronation , gathered their retinues and fled . And in the tents the empress ' clerks , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lar- derers , ushers and servants of all kinds , even her priests , were left to gather up their own possessions hastily and take the Oxford road or else melt off into the countryside . Even as the last of them fled straggling through the fields and forests to the west , a mob of London citizens , great beyond calculation , entered her abandoned lodgings and her sumptuous tents and plundered everywhere all that the foolish empress had left behind . Stephen 's queen was very gracious to Gervase and all the London aldermen . Gladly they raised a sum of money for her armies , and in return she gave them surety for some of her fine estates in Cambridgeshire . Likewise , with diplomacy , with promises and bribes , she won back to her husband 's cause the Earl of Essex and his Tower . The price she had to pay for Essex was somewhat higher than a few estates in Cambridgeshire , for he was powerful . Perhaps it did not seem so high a price to her , but for the citizens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the titles she conferred on him were Sheriff and Justiciar of London . The barons , as they called themselves , of London had for a short time ruled themselves in dignity . Now Geoffrey de Mandeville ruled them , and from his tower he was paying off old scores . There , in his cells and dungeons , wretched poor men suffered the most ingenious tortures that the experienced earl could dream up or adapt from all the methods of inflicting pain that he had ever heard . The year 1141 dragged on . In London a white icy fog lay on the river and the marsh . A gray fog , turning yellow where it mingled with the city 's smoke , drifted and settled in the highstreets and the lanes , stood thick , in crooked passages and underneath the eaves , and every sound was muffled at its source . The city was subdued by more than fog and autumn cold . It was the eve of All Soul 's Day but there was no revelry . Instead , long lines of hungry people stood at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs of Bayard 's Castle and the great halls of the wealthy , waiting for a dole of food . Hope burned  | very low this hallowed eve . And bitter as was the taste of fog , there was a greater bitterness within the heart . Thomas was idle in the hall of Osbert Huff-deniers . The clerkship in the merchant 's household was still nominally his but there was no work for him . Osbert sat idle too , and Gervase and the others . There was no work for them . That morning , standing in the fog by Tower Gate , Thomas had watched with many others while a man was hanged . He did not know the man ; who could have recognized him , stripped of his clothing , even of portions of his skin , eyeless , toothless , and emasculated ? He was hanged not once but three times , for three times the halter was put around his neck and he was strung up till his life was almost gone . Twice they brought him down and let him lie till life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third time they waited till his body ceased to twitch and then they cut the rope and let him drop . And what remained of him was left to lie there , broken , naked , splotched with blood , and no one dared move forward to keep off the dogs . When Thomas returned home and could speak of this , he asked Osbert what the man 's crime had been and Osbert told him that he was a staller , one of the leaders of the rising against the Tower when they had driven off the empress . " But so did we all do that ! " said Thomas . " Yes , yes , " said Osbert somewhat impatiently . " So did we all in spirit perhaps . But of course we were not at the Tower at that time . Perhaps this staller showed himself too plainly or perhaps threatened the earl himself . But who , can know ? Besides which we have bought our pardon from the earl for all that we did then . Presumably this staller could not raise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ righteous shock . " I have not paid the earl ! " he said . " Oh yes , " said Osbert , speaking of practicalities . " I paid for you  --  for my entire staff , of course . Why " ? he looked in some surprise at Thomas ' face ? " surely you did not think that I would let the members of my household suffer , did you ? " Thomas was silent . " That stiller had no patron , I should judge , " Osbert continued , " to raise the ransom for him . " " I sec , " said Thomas . But what lie saw was only the white  | naked body dangling in the fog , the twitching blood-splotched limbs and blackened face .. . " You must not be concerned with one man 's death , " said Osbert watching him . " No , " Thomas said . He was not so concerned . He had seen men die before , or suffer for their crimes in other ways . After all , the Cheapside Standard stood not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was a boy he had seen men put into pillory while their false weights or merchandise were burned before them . He had seen robbers blinded there , after their thefts were shown . Those men had suffered , surely , but their guilt was there before them , clear for all to see  --  just like the rotting fish hung round the neck of a cheating fishmonger . And he had seen men of rank beheaded there , a solemn sight . Twice he had seen it . But always justice had been done and always , it had seemed to him , the men went to their punishments and death content that it was so . He could see no justice in the death at Tower Gate . Perhaps there was no justice among kings and earls . He , like all the Londoners , had welcomed the gentle queen and loved her as he had hated the haughty empress . How kind her manner when she had repaid their loans with promises  --  and then how slyly she had won over the Earl Geoffrey . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was how it was , and he had had a taste of royal politics  --  perhaps enough to last his lifetime . He wanted no more part .  | AFTER THE NEW YEAR , Thomas left Osbert Huit-deniers and went back to his father . There had been nothing for him to do at Osbert 's ; there was little for him in his father 's hall . He kept his lonely father company and helped him to collect his dwindling rents  --  a cruel task these days  --  and sometimes went down to the hustings hall to hear the news , or to St. Paul 's for talk with educated men . The news concerned the war . The queen had gone on , after winning London , to win back the powerful and wily Henry , Bishop of Winchester , to his brother Stephen 's cause . On hearing this the empress turned in wrath upon the bishop for his defection and besieged him in his castle . But while her armies tightened around him and he in turn poured fire down upon them from his walls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the empress ' back . His forces ringed hers in the burning city ; she was trapped and forced to wriggle through his lines and flee . Her flight turned to a rout , her armies scattered , and she alone escaped . Her loyal brother Gloucester , defending her retreat , was captured . Thus it was , as the year rounded toward its end , that an exchange of prisoners was made  --  King Stephen for the Earl of Gloucester  --  and once again the sides were balanced , with their forces and their castles , one against the other . And as before the country and the people suffered . It was the year 1143 , the year , men said , that Christ slept and with him all his saints . The empress held the west , the king the east , and earls and barons shifted from king to empress , from empress to king as they saw opportunity , and over all was anarchy . In London men were safe once more , though times were grim . The Earl of Essex , caught changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stripped of all his castles and the Tower as well and he retired to the fens of Cambridgeshire . There he lashed out from the fortress he had made , killing and torturing , and still unsatisfied . After his plundering of the countryside came famine , and after famine plague . And it was said there fell a rain of blood three days and a great swarming of black flies whereof men died . All over England the land was dotted with these rough castleforts put up in secret , without royal leave , and from them lawless knights went out to rob and burn . Men of free lance and outlaws followed after them . Sometimes , around these barons ' strongholds , a man might walk for twenty miles and never see a house or plow or any living thing where once had been the little villages and manor farms with oxen in the fields and mill wheels slapping merrily beside the streams . To east and west the shadow of a peace prevailed , but even here , men said , it was like ancient evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they put them to death . Only the Church and the peace-loving archbishop held fast to order and the protection of the poor . When Thomas went to the cathedral of St. Paul 's he found relief from his preoccupation with the affairs of kings and his dismay over the state of England . Here his old masters from the school spoke frequently of other things : of what he learned in Paris , of the affairs in Rome , of the new sorts of reading  --  in Church law or in the ancient history of Britain now being brought to light . He met again the lord Rahere , the courtier and canon of St. Paul 's , the churchbuilder . Rahere remembered him from when he was a student . It was he who spoke most frequently of ancient times and of the marvels done then and of the prophecies , for he had in his keeping a copy of a manuscript not long since written by a fellow-canon , an Augustinian like himself , from Wales but now of Oxford : The Little Book of Merlin . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prophecies that Merlin made , saw in them veiled descriptions and allusions to his own time . The things that Merlin told of brought to his mind the acts of queens and princes that  | " wherefrom shall issue forth a fox , a wolf , and a bear . The Fox shall wear an ass 's head and in this guise shall she affright her brethren and make them flee . And when the fight between them hath begun she shall feign dead and move the Boar to pity her . Presently he shall go unto her and standing over her shall breathe upon her eyes . But she , not forgetful of her ancient cunning , shall bite his left foot from his body , and snatch away from him his right ear and his tail , and slink away into her cavern . Thereafter she shall turn herself into the Boar and then abide the coming of her brethren . Them also shall she slay with sudden-snapping tooth , and she shall be crowned with the head of a lion .. : " No , not crowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To him the Fox who wore the ass 's head was surely the Empress Matilda as the prophet had foreseen her in those ancient times , though Rahere told him that it was not of today that Merlin spoke but of another day . He and Rahere sat together , while they read , in the canons ' library of St. Paul 's . " But it is like today , " said Thomas . " For today we have these same portents that Merlin speaks of . Here , " he said , putting his finger in the little folio , " he speaks of London : London shall mourn and the Thames river shall be turned to blood . ' Or here ? for that could be in other times ; I know our history is long . . . " He turned the pages . " Here , the very story of Merlin Ambrosius himself . Born of no father . This is repeated in these days , for only yesterday I heard a story out of Kent of such a man  --  born of no father  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His child was taken with him and a monster fairy-child left in its place . " Rahere said , " There is more of magic in that story than of prophecy . Such things occur but are no proof that our times are the times that Merlin spoke of . " " But here again , " said Thomas eagerly . He had not such a firm belief in what he said , and both knew that the canon Geoffrey wrote with some little twinkling of wit when he translated this ancient tale of Wales into the Latin , but he enjoyed the argument . " Here again : Saturn the star shall fall upon the earth with a rain of heaven and shall slay mankind as it were with a  | crooked sickle . " ' He looked up . " As happened in the fens when the rain fell like blood and men were slain . Or here : A worm whose breath is fire shall burn up the trees with the vapour he shall breathe forth . ' We have had many fires recently . And following . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he read on , " ' And out of him shall issue forth seven lions disfigured by the heads of goats ... " ' Again he looked at Rahere eagerly . " And that same story out of Kent I told you of  --  about the man who disappeared into the earth  --  told of a flock of seven she-goats that were seen to walk across the sky , above the North Downs , high in the air ... " It was on May eve that the she-goats walked  --  or flew  --  above the hills of Kent . Many saw them  --  or saw someone who said he saw them  --  and knew them for a portent of strange things . Robert Drop , when he was told about them , went out into the woods , as he was wont to do , taking his baby girl upon his shoulders , to see if what they promised would come true . He was called Robert Drop because of the strange nature of his birth : his mother dropped him , so the villeins said , the way a stray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the year  --  some twenty , twenty-five years before  --  another time of trouble , when the White Ship went down . That was the year the Herlethingi had been seen  --  those ghostly horsemen of the sky  --  the last time over England . The fairy people had come east that year , as far as Kent , out of their secret homes . A knight of Sheldwich saw his dead wife , risen , dancing among them in a lonely place one night and seized her from them and brought her home and she lived many years after that time . And on another night a squire of Romney found a fairy woman in his bed and , never minding , let her stay there  --  though in the morning she was gone . A fairy coven came and made their little houses in a field within the forest not far from Canterbury , across the river Stour from where the Hortone manor stood , where Robert 's father lived  --  or had just died  --  and Robert 's mother , the young widow , went out across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their moonlit celebrations there , around their hillock  | homes . It was midsummer then . And after that the autumn came and then the winter and the long dark days and then the turn of year . And then the day came , gloomy afternoon , when the young widow went and laid herself down on the bed , panting with pain , and then rose up when she was able and took her cloak and crept out of the house , across the yard , across the common pasture , stopping from time to time hunched up and trembling with her hands upon the ground , beyond the ragged line of villeins ' huts , across the stubble of the wheat field , till she could go no more . There by a rotting haystack , squatting , growling between clenched teeth to stop her cries , heaving and sweating in hard labor , she brought forth a son . Her thought was that she would leave the child there , smothered beneath the haystack till it should rot away , or carry it , perhaps , down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she had not the strength for that , only to cut the cord and lift the child onto her breast and pull the cloak to hide it and lie back exhausted on the muddy earth . But the child cried , and that was her undoing . He opened wide the tiny mouth , no bigger than a keyhole in his tiny face , and wailed . Across the field a villein , working behind his hut , heard the first sound , heard it again and yet again , lifted his head to listen . Then he put down the tool that he was cleaning and walked slowly out across the field to look . Seeing the widow with a newborn child , he knew  --  as any man who knew the law would know  --  what he must do according to the customs of the men of Kent . So , without relish , for he was a man like many men who loved the lady well enough , he turned away and went back to the huts to give the word the horn should blow , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gather round to look upon the lawless widow and her child . They came , one man from each dark villein hut  --  there were thirteen of them in all  --  and one man from the mill . There was no man to lead them from the manor house now the old man was dead . Fourteen dark figures picked their way across the blackness  --  for it was night now  --  following a lantern 's spot of light . The widow saw the lantern and heard the crunch of clod tinder their feet . Rising upon her elbow she prepared herself so that when the light came close and played upon her , jigging  | across her body till it found her head , she showed them , suddenly , a gay smile out of her tired face . She spoke first , breathlessly , so as to forestall their questions : " Look , I have borne a son for Alfrid though he be dead , God rest him . " And she pulled back the cloak . " Look on Alfrid 's heir . " The villeins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so  --  unlikely so  --  or it might not . But there was none among them who would ask for trouble or invite the sheriff to come prying round or face the Hundred Court unless there was a pressing need . So they kept silent , staring at the smile . Thus was the matter hushed and kept within the bounds of Hortone , and Robert was the heir and grew up  --  different from the other boys , with a long narrow head and sharp black eyes ? and helped the reeve to supervise the villeins in the field ( the manor was not large ; the house itself but slightly bigger than the villeins huts , the land just half a sulung cleared from the scrub oak along the river bank ) and took the rents when they were due : three shillings to the monks of Christchurch and six shillings to his cousin Elured who was a Canterbury moneyer ; and tributes , also , as they were required , of wool and cheese and honey and all the other produce of the little farm  --  apples at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . The boy would come into the forge when all the craftsmen were at work and hang inside the doorway while his cousin stood beside the oven , tense and sweating , with the red glow of the fire on his sinewy arms , yelling at the young serf Azo to work the bellows harder . The place was dark yet fiery , smelling of smoke and of hot metal , of leather aprons and of earthen floor and the faint scent like some far forest when the molten silver hit the hardwood molds . And it was crowded with busy men : the prentice boy ran with the molds , full of their silver ribbons , to the flogging block ; the flogger beat each ribbon with his mallet , pounding it thin ; the cutter snipped it into little discs . The master craftsman took the dies that had come down from London with the silver bricks that day and rammed the spike end of the lower die into the cross-cut log . Then Elured himself stepped up  --  he liked to do his own work when true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , when the first disc was in place upon the lower die ,  | the upper die set on it straight and true , brought down his hammer with a ringing blow . Then he stepped back and peered at this first coin and found it good : well-centered , clean . And only then did he turn to his cousin from the manor and the produce he had brought , grunt at him indicating he should take it to the house , and turn again to work . At Christchurch the monks asked Robert who his father was and eyed him strangely and Robert said , he always said , that he was Alfrid 's son . This he believed  --  he had it from his mother 's lips  --  until the time came , when he was sixteen , for him to marry and he heard his mother talking to the strong girl he would wed , Wulviva , the miller 's daughter of Certeham . They sat within the little scrubby hall and Robert came into the doorway , silently , half shadow and half boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clump of bushes or in the dim house where there had been before nothing but bushes or a cloak that hung upon its peg beside the door . They did not see him . " Tell your father he is Alfrid 's heir , no matter what the villeins say , " his mother said . " Sometimes a child may linger over long within the womb ... " " Oh yes , " the girl said brightly . " I have seen our old cow do the same . " " You must not listen to this villein-talk of fairy men . . . " The words flew like a sudden spark spit by the fire , straight into Robert 's ear . They burned him . He had long known that he was not like other boys , that people eyed him , but he had never thought to doubt that he was Alfrid 's son . Now , with a whispered word , he knew . He was no son of man but of the Other Folk . As silently as he had come he left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except , years after , sometimes , to his little girl , not that she listened , she was too small for that , but just to hear the words . He married the strong girl from Certeham and when his mother died succeeded to the manor , although he did n't own it  --  he held it of his cousin Elured who held it of the monks  --  and with time he had children of his own : the little black-eyed girl named Hawisa and the boy Almon , who was born that year the goats walked in the sky , the year men suffered  --  as was written in the chronicles . The boy was born  --  nothing unusual , except his mother bled  | too much . The midwife had to call in three old women past their change to say the Lord 's Prayer over her nine times , which was the course prescribed in cases such as this . No one thought much about it  --  except the little sister Hawisa who saw the blood drip on the floor and heard her mother scream . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he put her on his shoulder in the way she loved and wandered down , beyond the shade and the manure pile where the flies buzzed , beyond the well , beyond the gate . Walking more steadily he went  --  as he had often done before  --  across the bridge , along the cart road , into the woodland on the other side . He knew the paths made by the forest animals and followed them , some haste now in his stride , holding the child with one hand and with the other keeping the branches from her face . He felt her little fists clenched in his hair and smelled her strong wet baby smell and loved her . Yet he went on , now almost running , slapping the leaves and branches , till he saw the open space among the trees . And there he stopped , and gathered himself in , and stood and gazed a long time at the sunshine ? watching the shadows run across the meadow and then back again as the wind moved the trees , noting the zigzag flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head to listen , sniffing the walmth of grass and herb and sun-baked lichen on the stone . And then he put the baby down and stepped into the meadow and stared across it at the fairy hills . They had been houses once  --  these little grass-grown mounds  --  with deep-dug , earthpacked floors and rounded roofs . Now their earthen roofs had fallen and the tufted grass and waving starflowers sprang from their slanting sides . They were not half as high as Robert as he approached them , moving steadily , intently , searching for something there . There was no sign of life around them , nor had been even when he first found them .. Yet he came searching for it often , too often . Suddenly he went down on all fours and burrowed , shifting the rotted wattle sticks , scraping the earth around the hole that once had been a door . The birds cried out a warning and Hawisa whimpered in the grass . Warning ! The father vanished and the baby left alone !  | It was too late for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , long long before , when the young widow had danced here among the fairy men . This was the year for suffering . And Robert suffered , smothering beneath the fallen sod-roof , dirt in his face . They found the baby in the morning , still in the fairy field , and found the father , also , where he had gone into the fairy hill . And they were frightened , fearing the power of the Other Folk , and word went round that in Hortone  --  not three miles from the seat of the archbishop himself  --  the archflamen had come again and swallowed up a man and left a fairy baby for a human child . This was the story Thomas heard . And though Rahere assured him that it was merely magic and not to be confused in any way with Merlin who was a prophet and possessed of a true spirit of God , Thomas could not help but see about him the fulfillment of some of those prophecies told to King Vortigern in ancient times by that strange youth to whom God gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and evil portents such as the times that Merlin spoke of , so Thomas thought , a time that his own life came to a seeming halt . This was the year that noble men as well as fairies fed on the lives of other men . This was the year Christ slept .  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | Clearly he saw the bland smile on Eustace 's empty face , the slack and happy look of one who long ago gave over all the taxing functions of the mind to someone else to cope with for him . Had the world been less kind to Thomas as he grew up he might have written them in his now adult mind as " schemer , " " fool . " But he did not . Measuring them against the other men whom he had known he saw their faults . But these were only flaws upon the surface of their aspect ; primarily these men were friends , who liked him , who meant well . And he liked them . Baldwin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , indicating Thomas . They sat at the table with their supper finished . " All very well , dear Gilbert , to have placed the boy with your distinguished kinsman as you say . But what has it got you ? Where is he now ? " " Just now we men of London bow our heads and wait , " Gilbert conceded . " There will come a time . . . " " Let us grant that there will come a time , " Baldwin broke in . " What then ? Is he to go on as clerk serving some merchant , running the mercenary errands of some city government ? " Gilbert drew a breath to speak but Baldwin did not stop . " Oh yes , dear host , I know you take offense when I say thus of London , some city . ' He laughed , and Gilbert smiled because he was the host and Thomas smiled because he was his father 's son . And then he said : " I would prefer if I , like you sir , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eustace and I could ask no better life , " he said . " I have long thought about it , " Thomas said . His father looked at him . " But as it is in England these days , " he continued , " I have not found the opportunity . " " No opportunity ? Why you are tonsured . You can read and write . Surely there must be someplace here nearby , safe here in London which you love so well . " " I 'm sure , " said Thomas . " But there is in England one place where men schooled in Paris , as I have been , most truly and most powerfully serve the Church . Where men of experience are needed . " " Yes ? "  | " And it has seemed to me that I should offer myself there . " " There ? Where ? " " In Canterbury , sir . In the archbishop 's household . " " Oh . " " But I have no introduction . " " Oh ? " " Someone of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of man whose word would carry weight with the archbishop would have to put my name to him . " " A man whose words are heard by the archbishop ? " Baldwin asked . " Or perhaps another bishop ? The Bishop of Boulogne ? " He pursed his lips . " Yes , such a man , " said Thomas . Baldwin sat back and looked at him . In Eustace 's mind a thought was forming ; he looked at Thomas , then to his brother , then at Thomas , breathing as though he might soon speak , but he said nothing . " If somehow I could have an introduction from such a man , " said Thomas , " perhaps the archbishop would receive it favorably . My father 's family and the archbishop 's both come from Thierceville , as perhaps you know . " He did not add that the archbishop 's family were of knightly rank and Gilbert 's common . " This might appeal to him , might carry weight . But only , of course , if he first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Aye , it might carry weight . Perhaps , perhaps , " said Baldwin . " But who do you have in mind to introduce the name ? " He pursed his lips and raised his brows and let the question hang . Then Thomas ' chin went up and he spoke boldly , formally : " I know this favor is within your power , Archdeacon Baldwin . You are indeed a man of reputation . " Thomas said . He watched the other closely . " Echoes of your fame have often come to us , here in our little backwater . " He grinned . Then , serious again , he added , " It is true I have been searching for just such a man as you to help me . And because you have known me so long , and known my father , I ask this favor now . " Baldwin leaned back again . He swept his arm around and rested it on Gilbert 's shoulder next to him . " I have had many favors in this house , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it , I think , very easily . I am not without some influence , as you say .  | Oh , nothing very much . A little power in my own diocese . But to speak frankly  --  without false modesty  --  my bishop listens when I speak . And owes me something , too , a little something . " He broke off , put his hands upon the table and rose up . " No thanks . No thanks , " he said , and turned away to go and take the seat beside the fire . The others followed him . " It will be done , " he said . " But not overnight , you understand that . These things take time . But I will do it . I have always liked you , Thomas . You know that . " It did take time , while the archdeacon put in his word for Thomas here and there as he found opportunity and sent a long and flattering letter off to Canterbury . But in time the thing was done , and Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house at Harrow in the fall , for Martinmas , he should present himself there for an interview . " Now , " said Gilbert , full of life once more . " The question is : Who is to accompany you ? It would have been better if you had been invited more directly , if the archbishop had sent someone to accompany you . But as it is . . . " His father 's eagerness and his awareness of their lack of standing rubbed on Thomas till he would have spoken rudely , but for pity when he watched his father 's face . Instead he only closed his mouth in a thin line . He did not need to be reminded how precarious was this introduction , how more than likely it would come to nothing , how foolish he would look arriving at the archbishop 's brilliant court without escort , a nobody . His father 's talk of it made matters worse . He rose and would have gone , as he went frequently these days , into the little parish church of his baptism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father spoke before he reached the door . " Squire Ralph ! " Gilbert blurted out . " Baillehache the marshal 's man ! " Ralph Bsillehache had frequented the merchant 's house when it had been a gayer place . He had been , long ago , a promising young squire , an armiger . But with the passing years , due to this circumstance and that , he had remained an armiger and his duties ever more menial . Now , the promise gone that he would rise to knightly rank or make a name other than that of " hatchet- bearer , " he performed still , alongside younger , fresher men , those tasks he once hoped were a path toward dignity . His hair was grizzled and his stocky figure thick with years , and he made much of his seniority among the marshal 's men while they in turn curled up their lips at him . Thomas knew none of this and Gilbert only by surmise ; he had not seen Baillehache in several years . He only knew there was a man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitality . " I 'll send him word at once , " he said , " that when he comes to Harrow with the archbishop I shall be much obliged if he will come and fetch you there . " And thus it was arranged . One bitter evening in November of that year , Archbishop Theobald rode on his gaited Spanish mule up the steep cobbled street of Harrow-on-the-Hill , smiling and raising his hand in blessing on the villagers who crowded by the way to see him pass . In his wake there ran a little hissing sound , the people whispering to one another how " I saw him pass , " " He looked at me , " " I touched his mount ; I touched his gown , " " I saw him pass . " And gentle Theobald , cold to the bone in his fur robes , rode on . His marshals had come several days before to hang the tapestries and lay the fire in the long drafty stone-and-timber hall that was the primate 's manor house of Harrow . Now he arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , men-at-arms , and servants of all kinds  --  and the great sloping courtyard of the house filled with men and mounts as darkness fell and the little crusts of ice froze solid in the mud . Pack horses were unladen in the dusk and led off steaming to the stable sheds and the wains unloaded and the chattels carried in : the curtains and mattress for the primate 's bed , the linen sheets and the fur covers to be warmed beside the fire in the hall ; the records and the writing tables of the clerks set on the benches hidden by the chancel screen ; the altar cloths and monstrance , ciborium and chalice , and all the precious relics borne to the chapel by the sacristan . All who had rank went stamping up the stairs into the hall .  | But outside tired men still worked . By the kitchen huts , where the hot fires drew idlers to watch , the slaughterers split the carcass of the deer the hunters carried in and kitchen-boys hacked off the heads of squawking fowl the villagers had brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath blew steam , pushed the long ladles piled with loaves into the glowing ovens . Among the lookers-on stood Ralph Baillehache . He had come earlier with the other warders , and his tasks were easy so he had already made his bed in a warm corner and drawn from the chandler his daily ration of two candle-ends and from the butler his half-measure of wine . Now he stood waiting for his bread . His rank did not permit him to take supper in the hall . The moisture glistened on his rough wool tunic and in the firelight his grizzled hair looked white . He shoved a little to make himself more room and others , feeling the push , looked round at him . " Well , " he said pleasantly , his eyes still squinting into the heat , " I ride tomorrow into London . " There was no answer to his words . " Aye , I must fetch a young clerk back who is to serve the archbishop . " Still there was silence and he carried on . " A brilliant lad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old dear friend of mine . " Someone behind him snorted in the dark , and to the faces in the firelight came the curve and glint of soft derisive smiles . But Baillehache , squinting at the ovens , paid no heed . " He always welcomes me , " he said . " And of course it is my policy to grant a favor when it is asked ... " Thomas , as soon as he saw Baillehache , knew that his father 's choice of guides was a mistake . The man came stamping into the hall midmorning , announcing he would stay for dinner but would not spend more time ; his duties pressed . In fact , he had been able to obtain leave from the marshal for only one day ? not because of his importance , but because the marshal did not like him well enough to grant him favors . He rose from dinner just as soon as he was full and urged his hosts to make their farewells brief . And so it was in haste that Thomas went off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pack a few belong- ings  --  what would he need ? ? and put on his scholar 's gown over his heavy cloak and he was ready . Midafternoon , in the cold drizzle under the thick-drawn clouds , he stood beside his father in the empty court , his horse in readiness and Ralph already mounted waiting impatiently . The father and the son turned , faced each other , sought in their minds for words . " Godspeed , " said Gilbert , showing a shadow of his old , bold smile . And Thomas ' heart winced painfully within him when he saw how little of the old-time pride and energy were left . He nodded wordlessly , stooped to receive his father 's farewell kiss . Then still without a word he turned and mounted and rode out . All afternoon they rode , silent and hunched against the cold , out through the wet gray fields and little farms , the dripping forest paths and open glades of Middlesex , twelve miles , till they approached the slope of Harrow Hill . Ralph reined his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at its top , crowning the hill , the tower of the parish church . Evening had come and men and beasts were home now . Here and there among the village houses a lantern glowed or , as a door was opened , warmth of firelight fell upon the night . Ralph spoke . " This , here , " he said , " is Harrow-on-the-Hill . " This much was obvious . " Where is the archbishop 's manor house ? " Thomas asked . " That . That is farther on . Beyond the church . A good distance . Not too far . " Ralph 's hesitation indicated there was more to come , so Thomas waited till , with a breath , a change of tone , Ralph went on . " You had better know , " he said , " that the archbishop keeps the morning hours for discourse with his clerks and other learned men . That is the time when you should come to him . Not after dark . Not suppertime like this . " Thomas said nothing and Ralph shifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know a lodging house where you could spend the night both safe and comfortable . That 's in the village . Then in the morning you could ride on to the manor . " Thomas felt despair come on him . So Baillehache had no place within the court even to introduce a friend or offer him a bed . As they had ridden through the darkening afternoon he had been conscious that , as his own hired horse was second rate , so  | was his escort . And with a winter chill about his heart he saw the bleakness of his chance . Tomorrow he must come before the great Archbishop Theobald in his wise , witty court , so lavish and so learned ; this household where the bright young men came to be trained as deacons or as bishops ; where when kings fought and the land fell into chaos , strength of government was stored ; where business with the pope was carried on and all decisions for the English Church were made ; this holy court of Canterbury . As Baillehache nudged his horse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a broken prop . But then the truth came gently to his mind . It was not Ralph 's weight in the balance here , but his . Had he come with a great procession heralding him , would that influence the archbishop ? He thought not . Theobald was known for kindness and fair judgment . Let me come to him like some unknown knight , he thought , with no fame of my own , no patron , riding a borrowed horse , led by a broken squire . Then let him judge me ! " Yes , " he called out to Ralph . " It is a wise plan . I 'll do as you say . Lead on . " The hostelry where Baillehache left him was a cottage with a loft , a mud and thatch affair with sty and dovecote close behind , much like any cotters home , although perhaps a little larger , with a carved wooden doorway and a bush , now dried up , hanging from a pole to show that ale was sold here . Inside , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The air was laden with the smells of animals and dung , of wet wool and of doubtful mutton cooking in a pot . The landlord came to scrutinize him before he let him in , a man quick in his step but very slow to smile . His wife likewise looked up with thin unsmiling face from where she stooped beside the cooking pot while from a corner three of her half-grown children stared through the smoke at the new visitor . Two men , sat slumping wearily at a small trestle table . Thomas , standing with his head bent in the doorway , saw it all . It was from homes like this he had received with thanks a bit of cold food handed out to him when he had been a student traveling to the schools . And though he might move in the high company of bishops , as he would do tomorrow , he was always in  | their debt . Stooping to enter , he smiled his merry smile at them as though he was delighted to be there . Their faces did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was with warmth as " the tall stranger with the blithe countenance . " For he was gay , keyed up and talkative , that night , feeling the challenge of tomorrow . After supper he entertained the company with marvels and weird tales that he had learned in reading and in traveling . Had they heard of Nicolas Pike , the merman , who was shaped like a man in all particulars but lived on the ocean bottom like a fish ? Or of the knight of Barfleur who found a shipwrecked maiden on his coast and married her and by her had two children before it ever was found out  --  it was his mother who discovered it  --  she was a dragon ? " The children and the knight and mother are living yet , " he smiled , " although the dragon vanished . " They sat long at the table , Thomas and his hosts , after the two other travelers had gone up to the loft to sleep . And Thomas told them of the wondrous tales he had been reading about the kings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved the power of skill and cunning over strength when he moved the towering boulders of the Giants ' Dance from Killare in Ireland onto the plain of Salisbury . " For at that place , " he told them while they stared at him , " four hundred princes died by treachery and Merlin kept alive their memory by placing there this magic monument . The Dance , ' they called it , of the Giants . ' They stared in silence , gathering his words , till the host 's son spoke up . " These giants , " he said . " Do they dance yet ? " " Oh yes , by the town of Amesbury , there they stand today , so I have heard , in a great circle staring at the sun . " " Staring at the sun , " the boy said . " Is it at night they dance then ? " Thomas laughed . " They stand there in a ring . As men might dance around a Maypole in the spring , " he said . " But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only stand . " " Do they not tire , standing there ? " " They are great stones , " Thomas explained . " They do not tire . " " Then they are not real giants ? Only stones ? " " Aye , " Thomas smiled upon him gently . " Only stones . The  | name is fanciful  --  the Giants ' Dance . They are the great stones that the prophet Merlin brought here out of Ireland for King Aurelius . " He saw their disappointment and said quickly , " There is another king whom Merlin helped , the great King Arthur , conqueror of all Gaul . " He paused to choose a tale of Arthur 's prowess out of the many he had read when suddenly his host spoke , full of fire : " Arthur will come again ! " Thomas stopped , amazed , and saw they were all staring at him with their dark eyes full of mysteries . " Arthur will come again , " the man repeated , leaning across the table poised and intense , " out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His eyes were fixed on Thomas ' . " He will come again to rule in all his glory ! " There was silence for the man spoke his faith as passionately as any priest of God . This was the hope they lived by , man and wife and son and little children moving closer at the words . He saw now they were Britons , their lines going back through all the generations  --  son to father to father 's father , back beyond Norman , Saxon , Dane  --  to that time when Britons ruled themselves . And Arthur was their hope that they would once again be masters of their land . Thomas , a Norman , dedicated to the Christian faith , thought differently . Yet he was touched that they should honor him  --  he with his tonsure and the accent of the conqueror  --  with this , their deepest secret . He looked a long time into their faces , at the wild hope in his host 's eyes . " Aye , as you say , " he said at last . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Thomas soon after sunrise and he left the hostel with his host 's smiles to follow him and all the children standing in the yard to see him go . He followed Ralph 's directions up the hill , beyond the church and out of sight , and still they looked after him . The wife came to the doorway where her husband stood . " I dreamed of that young stranger in the night , " she said . " Dreamed ? " said the host . " Yes , very powerful and strange . I dreamed I saw him take  | his cloak and with it cover up the spire of our church . " She turned and stared again with wonder up the hill . " Yes , very strange , " her husband said . " Perhaps it will bring luck . What was the garment ? Like a bishop 's robe ? They say to dream of bishops ' robes brings luck . " The woman shook her head . " I do n't remember now , " she said . " Only the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mornings , between the hour of Terce and dinnertime , Archbishop Theobald set aside for meditation and for discourse with learned men . The hours before this  --  after his celebration of the Mass  --  he usually devoted to the business correspondence of his see , closeting himself with his young clerks and secretaries . And in the afternoons , when he was on tour as now , he went about his lands blessing the common people and visiting the churches of his suffragans . Therefore it was at Terce , as Ralph had said , that Thomas would do best to introduce himself , when the archbishop was in his hall but not yet taken up with men of dignity and rank . They heard the bell strike for the Hour as Thomas , following Ralph , rode down the slope and through the manor gates . The court was crowded but no one took much notice of him and he was glad to tie his unprepossessing horse among the rows of them that stood beside the stables and head resolutely for the hall . Ralph left him there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done with him as well . The hall was large , though only half as large as Pevensey , and with a softer tone . The canvas hangings on the walls were new , a snapping fire burned and on the floor was fresh clean straw . Thomas paused , as he was trained to do at Pevensey , forbearing to stride forward overboldly yet not hanging back as one of menial state . He stood straight , pushing back his hood . Then with a quick look he sought out and recognized the steward standing at his station near the door and bowed to him , not deeply but as a man invited would introduce himself . And when the steward , taking the size of this newcomer , returned the nod , Thomas moved forward easily . " **32;507;TOOLONG , " the steward said , wary  | lest he give too warm a greeting to some stray young clerk seeking to break in on the archbishop . " Thomas , son of Gilbert of Thierceville , bidden by the Archdeacon of Boulogne to present myself , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again at Thomas ' lean , impassive face and bowed . " If you will come with me , " he said . Thomas saw that the archbishop had come into the hall surrounded by his learned clerks , all talking among themselves , and chairs were being placed beside the fire . He took his seat as Thomas and his guide approached and looked at them with mild and questioning eyes . " My lord Archbishop , " the steward said . " May I present Thomas of Thierceville , sent by the Bishop of Boulogne . " The archbishop 's face lit up to hear the name of his old home and he put out his hand as Thomas knelt before him . " Thierceville ! " he said . " You are of Thierceville , my son ? Welcome . " No , my lord , " Thomas said flushing . " But my father 's family has its roots in Thierceville , and from my childhood I have heard the name spoken with love . . . and come to know the fields and little running streams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light had faded from the primate 's countenance but he still smiled . " Yes , I know the little streams of Thierceville , " he said . " And you pronounce the name as native-born . Well , where do you come from if not from Thierceville ? " " I am from London , " Thomas said . One of the clerks behind the archbishop turned and whispered in another 's ear and snickered as he spoke . Thomas did not look up nor did the archbishop . Instead he motioned Thomas to come sit beside him while they talked . " Now , if I heard aright , " he said , his smile a little quizzical , " you come to me with recommendation  --  or bring a message from ? the Bishop of Boulogne ? " If he had ever felt more agony of hot embarrassment Thomas could not remember it . He did not even try to smile . " From the Archdeacon of Boulogne , " he said . " I am afraid I mumbled to your steward ... "  | " Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the archbishop said . " Surely . 1 have had a letter from him recently . Indeed . Of course . He spoke well of a certain youth . " Then , " Roger , " he said without turning round , " will you please fetch the letter from Boulogne which came some days ago . I have brought it with me I am sure . It will be in the chest . " The clerk turned from his whispering , bowed quickly and went off . " Then you must be that youth , " the archbishop went on to Thomas , and again his look was quizzical , " whom the archdeacon praised so lavishly ? " Thomas , feeling relief come creeping back , said , " Archdeacon Baldwin has often been a guest in my father 's house and I have known him since I was a little boy . If he spoke well of me it was because of old times ' , sake and friendship for my father . " " But more than that , I think , " the archbishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years in Paris at the schools ? " " Two years . " " In the study of dialectics I suppose ? " " Yes , my lord . " " With the brilliant Peter Abelard ? " Archbishop Theobald looked into his lap and brushed at a little piece of fluff that clung to the fur trimming of his robe . " No , my lord , " Thomas said noncommittally . " Master Abelard had left , the year I came to Paris . " " A pity that you missed his teachings . " " Perhaps , my lord . Yet there are many men who could not stand the liquid fire of his argument and went astray , far from the teachings of the Church  --  through no fault of the great Abelard , perhaps . " " What do you think ? You think his theories of rational inquiry heretical ? What of the Sic et Non ? Harmful to men of faith ? " This was a central question of the Church ; the long-worn argument had flared again since Abelard 's death a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my lord . I put my trust in those who are . Surely Abbot Bernard of Clairvaux knows the intent of God as well as any man . As he judges , so I believe . " " Aye , so do I , " said Theobald . " You knew that , did n't you , when you chose your words ? "  | Thomas was nonplused . What had the archbishop expected him to say ? Did he take him for a bumpkin ? . . . Or was that perhaps the very thing he had been wondering ? " But I think you spoke the truth , " the archbishop went on . " You would have said the same in any case . Now tell me honestly if I am right . " " Yes , my lord , " said Thomas . " It is the truth . " And he was grateful that he could say this from the heart , without a reservation . " Roger , have you found the letter ? " the archbishop turned . " Here it is , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is from the deacon of Boulogne rather than from the bishop as we had supposed . " " Thank you , Roger , " Theobald said crisply . " Thomas has told me . " He glanced a moment at the letter . " So you would like to serve me as my clerk ? Here we seek piety , sobriety , and righteousness . And you must give your best to all your work  --  that I demand  --  and study , too . England cries out for learned men . . . " He broke off and looked searchingly at Thomas . " Well , " he said finally , " Roger will see to all your needs . " Thomas sprang up , ready to fall before the archbishop in gratitude but Roger touched him on the arm . And the archbishop had already turned away . Others were waiting to speak to him . Roger led Thomas across the hall and round the corner of the chancel screen . There he turned and looked him up and down . " I suppose you left your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He smiled , but Thomas knew the words were meant to hurt . And he had hoped no one had noticed him with Ralph . " No , I did not , " he said . " No ? Where did you leave them then ? " " I brought nothing with me , " Thomas said . " No ? " the voice was light . " Baillehache should have told you . You will need a bed here , and your books . You do have books ? " " Yes , I have books , " and Thomas ' voice was even and his face as calm as ever the Lord Richer could have asked . " I will go and find my friend Baillehache and ask him to ride to London for them . I have a hired horse that I must send back to its owner . " He spoke the words " friend , " " hired horse , " clearly and evenly .  | " By all means , " Roger said . " One must not keep a hired horse too long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you say , " said Thomas . And he turned away and went out to the court to find Baillehache . When he returned he had no choice but to join Roger once again . He found him laughing with another clerk in a far corner behind the screen , and heard him saying " . . . I shall call him the baillehache clerk for the name is apt  --  he came in like a hatchet , battering his way , without a proper invitation and unheralded . . . " He broke off as his eye caught Thomas where he stood beside the screen . He beckoned him . " Come and be introduced , " he said . Thomas advanced . The other clerk rose shyly , a small slender boy , younger than Thomas . Roger was more nearly Thomas ' age , taller and more fleshy than the boy beside him although shorter by almost a head than Thomas . They made a threesome like a set of stairs as they stood facing each other warily . " John Belmeis , of Canterbury , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am Roger of Pont l'Eveque . " He bowed . Thomas returned the bow unsmiling . " Thomas , " he said . " Of London . " " Of London ? " Roger asked . " I thought by your scholar 's gown you were from Paris . " " London and Paris , " Thomas said . " London and Paris , " Roger echoed . " Until now we had considered John here our most learned . John speaks all languages . He is our genius . He is our brightest star . " John blushed and Roger went on , " But I can see you may replace him . London and Paris . Do you know Hebrew ? " " No ... " Thomas said . " Greek ? " " No . " " Latin ? " Thomas smiled grimly . " A little . " " A little , " Roger said . " John is above us all in knowledge of these languages . Is it not so , John ? " John waved away the claim and stammered , " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are far quicker than I am to learn ... "  | " Oh , I am quick , " Roger broke in . " I am the man to run your errands and fetch your letters . If it is speed you want , I am your man . " He had a long face with a well-fleshed curving nose and mobile mouth . His lips were soft and pointed at the center , always moving , and conveyed his feelings better than his eyes . " And what is your gift ? " he asked suddenly , turning his soft pointed smile on Thomas . " My gift ? " said Thomas . " Oh , I am handy with the hatchet . " Roger laughed and for the first time looked at him with warmth . " You have the gift of wit , " he said . " Come " ? he put a hand on Thomas ' shoulder and the other around John 's ? " we will make a threesome . " And in a voice like a conspirator , " The other clerks are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it so , John ? " Thomas saw surprise and doubt in John 's face , but Roger went on , still with his hands upon their shoulders , " We will make a threesome and stand against them all . Learning and lightning youth .. . " Oh , " a thought struck him and he dropped his arms . " Minerva , Mercury . . . and Mars . A classical triumvirate ! The gods demand it , do n't you see ? Minerva , Mercury and Mars ! " He laughed the loudest at his joke but John laughed too and Thomas , looking at them , could not help but smile . The hour of Sext had not yet rung and he was one of them  --  a long step from this morning .  | RCHBISHOP THEOBALD REMAINED at Harrow well into Advent . Then with his court he made a leisurely return to Canterbury for the Christmas feast . Thomas went with him and for the first time came to know the great cathedral and the monastery buildings of Christchurch . As they approached it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark and massive jewel . Its stones were carved , its wooden roof was painted red and blue and black , its turrets all were topped with gilded pinnacles and from the apex of its central tower a golden cherub rode against the sky . The dark monastic buildings nestled by its side around the great quadrangle of the cloister with its wintry garden and its pillared walks : the dormitories for the monks and their refectory and library and chapter house . The palace stood somewhat apart and stretched a covered walk to join them as though to emphasize the primate 's dual role as Archbishop of Canterbury and as Abbot of Christchurch . Beyond this somber cluster lay the outbuildings and halls : the jumble of the kitchens with their sculleries and larders , bakehouse , brewhouse , buttery ; the home for aged monks and the infirmarian 's lodging by the long infirmary hall and little house for letting blood ; the school for novices and prior 's hall nearby ; the baths ; the guest halls for the rich and for the poor ; the farm buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sties and goatsheds , houses for the hens and ducks ; the hives , the dovecotes and the tanks for fish ; the small walled gardens and the open fields . It was a great establishment , center of wealth and power , seat of God 's highest representative in England , and all its business was conducted by such a complex of strong personalities that Thomas ' bright perception was engaged , all the first weeks , simply in learning them and their relationships .  | The strange triumvirate that he had joined with John Belmeis and Roger of Pont 1'Eveque prolonged itself for many months , though never did the two antagonists become true friends . But it was advantageous to them all , especially to Thomas , as it gave him some distinction in the populous court . All three young men were called upon from time to time , as were the other clerks , to write the archbishop 's letters , witness agreements , observe his councils and , occasionally , give opinions . Thus hardly a piece of business was done  --  a prebend granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some parish churchyard  --  that one of the three had not direct and intimate knowledge of it . Details of correspondence with the king , the pope , with other men of power were , almost without exception , known and shared among the three . They soon became the best informed and the most balanced in their understanding of all the clerks in the archbishop 's chancery . Thomas and Roger were both quick of mind and apt in citing precedent . But Thomas was less prone than Roger to rely on personal bias in his judgments . John was more scholarly , devoted to his books , and found less pleasure in arbitration and diplomacy . He lived somewhat withdrawn . Thus he was unaware when Roger found pretext to slander Thomas , carrying tales to the archbishop of his moral laxity . The charge was false but had the ring of credibility because it found its shape in Roger 's own abnormal practices . For it was Roger 's sin at this time of his life to prey upon the little boys who studied singing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then so frightening them to silence that they dared not speak  --  nay , so the monk who was their choirmaster said , they dared not open up their mouths at all and were a total loss to him for days . He did not say he knew the reason why , for he did not . Only the little boys  --  each frightened boy alone  --  knew why and did not speak . At this time Thomas was by contrast as far from the temptations of the flesh as he had been at any time since he left Pevensey . His were the sins of pride , ambition , lack of charity in judgment , not of moral laxity . Prayer was a daily , almost hourly ritual at Christchurch and an antidote to craving . Denial had some purpose now that ambition had a goal . Therefore he was  | amazed when Master Hubert of the Chancery came to him suddenly as he sat studying a writ and told him without preamble that there was no longer any place for him within the primate 's household . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please them all if he were gone by noon . Thomas sat open-mouthed when Hubert turned as though from dirt and left . Then hatred and a passion for revenge rose burning in his throat . The accusation came from Roger he felt sure , it smelled of him . He jumped up , ready to seek him out . Then  --  caution . What would that bring ? A cheap exchange of insults , pain and disgust to the archbishop , laughter from others , and a world lost for him . Better to let all thought of vengeance go , for now . He left the little room where the clerks sat , all eying him , for they had heard the words and seen his face grow terrible . He crossed the hall and left the palace and the precincts , driven out by fury and the need to think . It was impossible to go directly to the archbishop crying for mercy , or for justice even . There was a wall about the gentle Theobald he had not learned to vault . One must be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gate , with all his wrathful thoughts still flaring in his heart he sought to pray . " ' Oh Lord my God , " he groaned , " in thee have I put my trust ; save me from them that persecute me . . . " Rebellion rose up once again . " It is unjust , unjust . . . " Now for the first time in his life he felt the need for scourge to whip his body and his mind into submission . He crept into the wintry reeds beside the wall and knelt , a curious figure , forcing his knees and body to a humble posture while with his will he struggled to subdue his heart : " Oh Lord correct me , but in judgment not in anger ; neither chasten me in thy displeasure . . . but have mercy on me , Lord , for I am weak ... my soul is troubled . . . " But all the while the little thoughts went chasing through his mind : One must be found to intercede for me . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walter has been kind to me . . . accessible . . . and the archbishop 's brother , dearly beloved . . .
