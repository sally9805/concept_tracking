For a time last week in the small Jerusalem courtroom , it was Jew v. Jew . Stately Baron Pinhas von Freudiger ( his grandfather had been ennobled by Austro-Hungarian Emperor Franz Josef ) , who was formerly a prominent Jewish leader in Budapest , took the witness stand . As he emotionally described his dealings with Adolf Eichmann in an effort to save the lives of Hungary 's 1,000,000 Jews , a squat , burly man in a golfer 's cap leaped to his feet screaming " Hypocrite ! You duped us so you could save yourselves and your families ! Our families were killed . You have no right to testify ! " <P> Doorstep Murder . While police hustled the kicking , screaming man from the court , Baron von Freudiger brushed tears from his eyes . The interruption was a grim reminder of the bitterness that still ravages the Hungarian Jews who escaped Nazi annihilation . Some survivors insist that rich Jews bought their freedom by shipping poor Jews to the ovens of Auschwitz . One of the baron 's colleagues . Dr. Rudolf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his dealings with the Nazis . Later , Kastner was murdered on his doorstep by vengeful Jews . <P> The court pressed Baron von Freudiger to explain why he had not warned Jews in rural Hungary of scheduled deportations and the fate that awaited them . " By the time we realized what Auschwitz was , 300,000 people from Hungary had already gone , " replied the baron . " What could we have done ? There are people here who say they were not told to escape , but 50% of the people who tried to escape were captured and killed . And others say , ' Why did you tell them to escape ? ' " Snapped a judge : " I do n't think that is an answer to the question . " <P> But the fratricidal anger among Jews gave little comfort to Defendant Adolf Eichmann . Witness after witness nailed down his direct responsibility for the slaughter . Hungary 's Regent-Dictator Admiral Nicholas Horthy was intimidated when a warning from the U.S. to call off Jewish deportation was followed up by a heavy bombing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overruled by Eichmann . An Eichmann lieutenant proposed that Jews be deported at a rate of 3,000 a day ; Eichmann-fearful that the advancing Red army might rob him of his prey-boosted the rate to 12,000 daily . <P> Abraham Gordon , 34 , described how Eichmann was personally implicated in beating to death a Jewish teen-ager accused of stealing cherries from an orchard : " The screams lasted about ten or 15 minutes , then stopped . The door opened , and Eichmann came out . He was a little disheveled ; his shirt was sticking out , and I am almost sure that I saw bloodstains . I heard Eichmann mutter two words in German , ' Ubriges Mistvolk ' superfluous garbage people . " Minutes later , the " swollen , bloody " corpse of the teen-ager was dragged away .
