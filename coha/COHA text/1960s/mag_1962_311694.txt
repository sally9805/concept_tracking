The first provision in the U.S. Constitution 's Bill of Rights bars " an establishment of religion . " Last week the Supreme Court handed down a decision affirming that provision-and thereby brought upon itself a deluge of denunciation . Eminent clergymen attacked the decision as " shocking " and " tragic . " Members of Congress put forward a score of proposed constitutional amendments to nullify the effects of the ruling . Newspapers , snowed under by wrathful letters from readers , erupted in editorial anger . To the Supreme Court Building in Washington came hundreds of letters and telegrams agreeing with the sentiments of Los Angeles Municipal Judge Ida May Adams , who concluded her usual court-opening prayer with a new plea : " God bless the Supreme Court and in Your wisdom let it be shown the error of its ways . " <P> " An Abomination . " The decision that summoned the storm involved a brief prayer that the New York State Board of Regents had composed and " recommended " for use in public schools . The Regents were trying to resolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held in public schools , attended by children of parents who profess various religious beliefs . The issue had vexed school authorities for more than a century : in the 1840s , Roman Catholics rioted in New York City in protest against the reading of the King James Version of the Bible in public schools . <P> Trying to avoid offending anybody , the Regents adopted this " nondenominational " compromise : " Almighty God , we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee , and we beg Thy blessing upon us , our parents , our teachers and our country . " Many school boards adopted the prayer . Normally it was spoken by the class in unison at the start of each school day , with the teacher leading the recitation . In keeping with state court decisions , the Regents notified school authorities that no child could be compelled to say the prayer , and that any child had the right to be excused from the room while the prayer was being recited . <P> Inoffensive as the prayer seemed to the Regents , it offended a lot of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups officially protested against it . So did the American Civil Liberties Union and various freethinker groups . The leaders of a Lutheran church in Peekskill , N.Y. , denounced the prayer as " an abomination " ( because it contained no mention of Christ ) . The Methodist Church board in Schenectady , N.Y. , declared that the " place for specific teaching and formal practice of religion is in the home and in the church . " <P> Three years ago , five parents of children attending public schools in New Hyde Park , a suburban community on Long Island , brought suit in the New York State Supreme Court to halt recitation of the Regents ' prayer on the ground that it violated their beliefs . Of the five parents , two were synagogue-going Jews , one was a Unitarian , one a member of the Society for Ethical Culture , one an agnostic . After the Court of Appeals , the state 's highest court , upheld the Regents ' prayer in a 5-to-2 ruling , the parents carried their case to the U.S. Supreme Court . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
