txt  | in 40,000,000 years . Large meteors that have been found are thirty-three tons ( Ahnighito ) , found by Perry on the ice in Greenland , and sixty tons ( Hoba West ) , found near Grootfontein in South Africa . Interplanetary Dust A large amount of what may be called interplanetary dust exists in our solar system as well as elsewhere in space . This consists of microscopic dust particles and electrons thought to have originated largely from meteors and from stars . It is concentrated in the ecliptic plane , becoming less dense as the distance from the sun increases . Other possible origins of interplanetary dust particles may be any of the following : 1 . Debris left over from the formation of the solar system . 2 . Interstellar particles that are just passing through the solar system . 3 . Debris produced by the collisional disintegration of asteroids. 4 . Debris produced by the evolutionary disintegration of the nuclei of comets . Now let us turn away from the solar system and our own galaxy and examine other galaxies . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spectra of light from these galaxies . From what we know about the Doppler effect , we know that these distant galaxies are receding from us at ever-increasing velocities . It was discovered many years ago that as light source is approaching or receding from an observer there is an apparent change in its wavelength . There is no change in the velocity of light emitted from a source due to its motion , but the light waves are crowded closer together as the light source approaches an observer , and they are spread farther apart as the light source goes away from the observer . This causes the wavelength of the light to appear to change , a phenomenon which is referred to as the redshift ; that is , the spectral lines are shifted toward the longer wavelength or red end of the spectrum as the source recedes from the observer . And the higher the velocity , the smaller and dimmer becomes the galaxy . From this knowledge , it can be seen that there is a relationship between the redshifts and the distance that the source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows that the relationship is linear . Thus , from the redshift in the spectra from a receding galaxy , its velocity can be deter-  | mined . This , coupled with the size and brightness gives us the relationships as follow : figure The observations from which these estimates were calculated were made by Humason . The most distant nebulae are estimated to be 230,000,000 to 240,000,000 light-years away . Fred Hoyle believes that new galaxies are condensed at approximately the same rate as galaxies recede from view . Thus , the observable density of stars in the universe remains about the same . To support this belief requires that new material be continuously created . It has been estimated that galaxies about ten billion lightyears away are receding at the speed of light . This means that we could never see them no matter how powerful our telescopes . Two factors combine to restrict our vision : the velocity of recession is such that the resulting wavelength of light is in the invisible part of the spectrum , and even if this were not so , the distance is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen . Therefore , events that have already happened or will happen outside this finite observable universe can not be observed . Even though it may finally be determined that the universe is infinite , the observable universe is quite finite . THE ORIGIN OF THE UNIVERSE Over the years there have been many different theories advanced regarding the origin of the universe . Some of these are completely new ; others are modifications or refinements of older theories . At the present time there are two theories which are predominant ; these are the evolutionary theory and the theory of continuous creation . Each of these theories presupposes an expanding universe but differs in the manner in which the expansion starts and the manner in which it progresses . A short review of these two theories follows . The Evolutionary Theory This theory was originally conceived in 1922 by Dr. Alexander  | Friedman , a Russian mathematician who was working on an alternate approach to Einstein 's general relativity theory . From this he conceived the possibility of an expanding universe . A few years later Dr. Edwin P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was done by taking note of the fact that the light from the galaxies observed was redder than had been expected . The modern version of the evolutionary theory was advanced by Georges Lemaitre , a Belgian cosmologist . He believed that all matter in the universe was originally contained in one huge , very dense atom . The radius of this atom was estimated to be as great as the distance from the earth to the sun , about ninety-three million miles . According to his theory this original atom exploded , breaking up into smaller and smaller radioactive pieces flying in all directions . This initial breakup continued until the smallest pieces were the size of the smallest atoms . Lemaitre believed that radioactive substances , which still exist , are the result of the original explosion . This theory is popularly called the big-bang theory . The theory supposes that as the initial explosion progressed , the universe increased in size , a result of the pieces speeding outward from the source of the explosion . Gravitational forces were effective from the beginning and tended to reduce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expansion had almost stopped and thus reached a nearly static phase corresponding to Einstein 's model , which considered the universe to be static . In this phase the gravitational forces were almost balanced by the cosmic repulsion forces . Lemaitre believed that everything stayed in this static phase for a few billion years and then started to expand again . The expansion continued as the cosmic repulsion force gradually exceeded the gravitational force . As the excessive force increased , the rate of expansion became greater . As this occurred and the expanding bodies became farther and farther away from each other , the gravitational forces became less and less , thus increasing the velocity of the bodies and the rate of expansion . This is the phase in which we are now . Sometime during the latter stages of the initial expansion or the initial phase of the present expansion , stars and galaxies were formed from condensations of the exploding matter . There will come a time when the celestial bodies will be so far-dispersed that  | the gravitational force will be practically nonexistent , and the cosmic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expansion will become constant . It is possible that the universe is nearing that point now . The preceding theory assumes a finite universe that is gradually increasing in size . Pursuing this theory to its ultimate end results in the conclusion that the end is nothing . That is , if the universe continues to expand with nothing new added , and there is no reversal of the process , the density of the universe will progressively become less until a point is reached at which there is nothing left to expand . In recent times George Gamow has provided several changes or refinements of Lemaitre 's basic concepts of the evolutionary theory of the universe . A major change is Gamow 's belief that the universe is now and always has been infinite in mass and volume . Instead of one large atom exploding initially , as in Lemaitre 's theory , Gamow 's concept is that an infinite number of mass points exploded simultaneously . Prior to this explosion the elements themselves were formed . Gamow 's refinements include an analysis of how this took place . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motivating force rather than any change in the basic theory . The motivating force in this modification is assumed to be electrical rather than gravitational . This idea starts with the elementary particles ? the proton and electron that make up an atom of hydrogen . For all usual electrical purposes it is assumed that the charges on the electron and proton are equal and opposite , and this is true for most practical situations . However , this modification of the basic theory assumes that there is a very slight difference in the magnitude of the charge on each particle . If the charge on the proton is slightly greater , then each hydrogen atom will have a small positive charge . For each atom this difference in charge can be infinitely small , and yet the overall effect , considering all of the hydrogen atoms in the universe , can be great enough to overcome any gravitational effect . This could account for the motivating force causing the universe to expand . The difference in charge that would be required is so slight as to be undetectable with presentday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the universe as a whole is esthetically satisfying as such a theory would parallel the theory of biological evolution as a part of our natural living world . The Theory of Continuous Creation This theory was first suggested by Sir James Jeans . Later , Hermann Bondi , Thomas Gold , and Fred Hoyle supported and elaborated upon it . Now many other eminent scientists support it , although it does appear to violate the law of the conservation of energy . However , if new atoms are added , the total amount of energy remains the same ; thus the law of the conservation of energy is not violated . One conclusion of the evolutionary theory is that the universe will eventually " die . " Some proponents of the theory of continuous creation may support it as an indication of their faith that the universe will have an infinite life . The theory of continuous creation supposes that hydrogen atoms are continuously being created in space , and the formation of new galaxies from these new atoms equals the rate at which galaxies disappear from our observable universe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same as that of the evolutionary theory . The difference is in the original source of the material for the universe , but this theory also presupposes an origin an infinitely long time ago . Its advocates can say that the universe had no beginning and that there will be no end . They can also say that this is a steady-state condition . A plausible explanation for the production of new hydrogen atoms is that it is a property of existing stellar matter to create new matter . Such an explanation , however , does not explain how new hydrogen atoms are produced . As new atoms appear , new stars are formed , followed by new galaxies . Finally the galaxy reaches a saturation point and throws matter into space to form the nucleus of a new galaxy . THE AGE OF THE UNIVERSE Various methods have been used by scientists to estimate the age of the universe or some part of it such as the earth , moon , stars , star clusters , and galaxies . A description of the more common methods follows . Radioactive Materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These  | elements decay over a period of millions or billions of years into other elements or other isotopes of the same element . For example , uranium 235 , uranium 238 , and thorium 232 decay to three isotopes of lead : lead 207 , lead 206 , and lead 208 , respectively . The half-lives of the two uranium isotopes and thorium are .7 I , 4.5 t , and 13.9 billion years , respectively . This would lead us to believe that if each of the original elements were equally abundant when the earth was formed , the exact percentage of each in the earth 's crust could be calculated . Such a calculation results in an estimate that the age of the earth is at least three billion to four billion years . The Origin of the Moon How the moon originated has a definite relationship to the ages of both the moon and the earth because the moon may have once been part of the earth . It is known that the rotational speed of the earth is decreasing , the decrease being caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but if it amounts to only . oi of a second per day and has been in effect since the earth 's formation , it means that the earth was rotating at a very high rate at the time of the birth of the moon . It is estimated that the period of rotation at that time was 4.8 hours . Before the moon separated , the tides were caused by the sun 's influence . Although the effect of the sun on the earth 's tides was much less than the effect of the moon now , the period of these tides corresponded closely to one of the basic frequencies of the earth , causing a resonance . The tides were thus augmented until a segment of the molten earth separated , forming the moon . The age of the moon is considered to be the time that has elapsed since it broke away from the earth . As this is estimated to be shortly after the earth was formed , the earth is assumed to be only a relatively few years older . An alternate theory is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been a separate body , having been formed in the same manner as the earth , or perhaps it was a separate body formed elsewhere and was captured by the earth 's gravitational field as it passed near . However , using the rate at which it is receding from the earth ( about five inches a year ) , and considering the fact that its original distance from the earth is not a critical factor , the age of the earth is determined by either method to be about four billion years . The age of the moon would be slightly less than four  | billion years if it was formed from the earth . If it has always been a separate body and was simply captured by the earth , its age is indeterminate at the present time . After man has landed on the moon an estimate of its age can be made using the same methods by which the age of the earth was estimated . Cooling of the Earth 's Crust In the formative stages of the earth it was first a molten mass at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth 's crust to cool from its initially high temperature to its present temperature , an estimate can be obtained for the age of earth . This results in an unrealistically short time , but when the heating caused by radioactive materials in the earth 's crust is superimposed on the initial heating , a time is obtained which seems plausible . This time , which represents the age of the earth , is two billion to four billion years . Star Clusters Stars tend to cluster in our own galaxy as well as in other galaxies . Both dense and loose star clusters gradually dissipate but for different reasons . All clusters are affected by the gravitational attraction of other clusters . The loose clusters , in addition , tend to be affected more by the rotation of the cluster . This is possibly due to the denser nuclei of the loose clusters which induce a higher rotational velocity . Although the loose clusters of stars consist of a far lower total number of stars than the dense clusters , they may have a higher concentration of stars at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and galaxies we are not speaking of the high rates of rotation to which most of us are accustomed in terms of revolutions per second or revolutions per minute ; we are speaking of revolutions per billion years . An average rotation is four revolutions per billion years . In the case of dense clusters , a slightly different dispersion process takes place . The stars of a dense cluster are assumed to behave like the molecules of a liquid ; that is , the higher velocity molecules are lost to the liquid by a process similar to evaporation . The higher velocity stars escape first , and the dispersion continues until the cluster is completely dispersed . The rate of dispersion for both loose and dense clusters is about the same and leads to an estimate of two billion to three billion years as the average life of a cluster .  | The fact that several hundred clusters of stars still exist in our own galaxy leads to an estimate that the galaxy is not likely to be more than four billion years old . Meteorites As stated earlier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from farther out in space . Each one is probably a separate fragment of a disintegrated planet . Each of these fragments has its separate orbit about the sun based on the gravitational forces acting upon it . The orbits of many meteorites have come close enough to the earth to be attracted to it and have crashed on the earth . Many of these have been found and analyzed . They are of two general types ? stone and iron . Each type has traces of other elements present . Using methods based on radioactivity , which are considered reliable , the ages of meteorites have been determined , and these give estimates of the age of the solar system . The best estimate made by this method is 4.5 billion years . Separation of Binaries In our own galaxy and others there are many double stars , called binaries . They are coupled by mutual gravitation and act as a single unit much as the two ends of a dumbbell . Over a long period of time these stars are pulled farther and farther apart by the gravitational influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they separate and act as individual stars rather than as a binary . A rough estimate can be made of the age of a galaxy and the age of the universe by estimating the number of double stars that have separated in a galaxy , the amount of separation , and the time that it has taken for this separation to occur . Estimates have been made that a binary which has an average distance between the two stars of one hundred times the distance between the earth and our sun ( an astronomical unit ) will take about two trillion years to completely separate , that a binary with a separation distance of one thousand astronomical units takes about seventy billion years to completely separate , and a binary with a separation distance of ten thousand astronomical units takes about two billion years . Using these estimates and the binaries in our own galaxy , it has been concluded that our galaxy is about ten billion years old .  | Universal Expansion Theory Assuming that the evolutionary theory is true , and knowing the velocity and distance from us of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has elapsed since that galaxy was close to our own . Astronomers agree that the receding velocity of galaxies increases approximately fourteen miles per second for every million light-years that they are away from us . Hoyle has estimated that it takes approximately one hundred billion years for a galaxy which was originally close to ours to pass beyond the boundary of the observable universe . Using the expansion theory , the receding velocity , and distance , it has been estimated that the universe is ten billion to thirteen billion years old . Fusion The energy of the sun and most other stars is produced by a chain of fusion processes . This process is the carbon cycle , by which hydrogen is converted into helium . It is estimated that about one-half of our sun 's mass is now hydrogen and that eight hundred million tons are being converted into helium every second . It is estimated that this process has been going on for about six billion years and will continue for ten billion to fifteen billion years . The same method can be used to estimate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , temperature , and mass . It is believed that the fusion process starts when an initial mass of stellar material reaches a sufficiently small size so that the temperature caused by gravitational pressure is high enough to sustain the nuclear fusion process . The life of a star is dependent upon its average burning rate and its mass . From these factors it is possible to calculate the life of a star . Such calculations show the estimated life of other stars in the universe to range from five billion to twenty-six billion years . Clusters of Galaxies As there are clusters of stars , there are also clusters of galaxies on a much larger scale . Each galaxy contains many billions of stars which constitute the light of the galaxy . Observation of these galaxy clusters suggests a gradual dissipation of the clusters , apparently caused by the attraction of other galaxies of the cluster . Each cluster is considered as a unit . As it dissipates , each cluster  | retains its general shape but recedes as a whole from other clusters . Analysis of the rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the estimate of three billion years resulting from the kinetic energy of the stars analysis . Kinetic Energy of the Stars This method of determining age assumes that star systems follow the same laws of energy as a gas . Different gases have molecules of different mass . Molecules of a gas with a high mass have a lower velocity than molecules of a gas with a lower mass . When gases with molecules of different masses are mixed , the velocity , and therefore the energy , of the mixture of molecules will reach a state of equilibrium . Assuming that stars follow this same law , an analysis can be made which results in an estimate of several billion years , perhaps three , as the age of our galaxy . The accuracy of the age obtained by this method is , of course , dependent upon the accuracy of the initial assumption . Salinity of the Oceans About two hundred and fifty years ago Edmund Halley made the suggestion that the earth 's age could be determined by ascertaining the length of time required for the oceans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presupposes that there was no salt in the oceans originally , and that the sodium , one of the constituents of salt , gradually increased in the oceans from the soil and rocks on the surface of the earth . Chlorine is assumed to have come from volcanoes submerged below the ocean floor and to have combined with the sodium to form salt . As evaporation took place , the salt remained , gradually increasing in amount . As it is impossible to calculate accurately the rate at which sodium and chlorine accumulated in the oceans , the estimate of the age of the earth by this method is quite unreliable . One factor that is difficult to estimate accurately is the rainfall rate for all parts of the earth for all time in the past . The best estimate that can be made of the age of the earth by this method is one billion to seven billion years . SUMMARY The various methods for estimating the ages of various parts of the universe and the estimated ages are summarized in Table I. The  | methods used for estimating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 3.5 billion to 4 billion years . Meteorites are the most reliable method of obtaining the age of the solar system . From many analyses of meteorites 4.5 billion years is a good estimate of the age of the solar system . Estimates of the age of our galaxy range from three billion to ten billion years . Estimates of the age of the universe vary from five billion to twenty-six billion years . figure It is difficult to decide which of the theories described above for the origin of the universe is correct . The life of a man or even many generations of men is so short compared to the age of the universe that it is very difficult for man to take a realistic viewpoint . The basis for some of the theories is an extension of physical laws that have been determined to fit certain happenings on earth . It could easily be that these terrestrial physical laws do not hold for distances far out in space . For example , gravitational attraction may be weaker at great distances than supposed by Newton . Although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solar system , the gravitational force may not vary in this manner for all distances in space . If Newton 's law of gravitation does not hold , there may have been a smooth and continuous expansion without an initial explosion .  | Another point that should be discussed is the creation of hydrogen atoms . This is a necessary step in the theory of continuous creation , and it is true that free hydrogen atoms do exist in space , but there might be a previous step . It is perhaps more plausible to surmise that neutrons are created , rather than complete hydrogen atoms , as there is apparently no overall charge imbalance in the universe . The neutrons would then decay into protons and electrons to form the hydrogen atoms . In the theory of continuous creation it is assumed that new matter is created at the same rate that old matter disappears . At first thought this might be considered to be a tremendously high rate . Actually , in order to maintain a constant number of hydrogen atoms in the universe only one hydrogen atom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of volume in the observable universe . According to the law of conservation of energy , energy can not be created or destroyed . The early supporters of the theory of continuous creation ? Bondi , Hoyle , and Gold ? contended that the overall amount of energy in the universe remains constant , and therefore there is no violation of the law on conservation of energy . If one considers only the energy added and neglects the energy which disappears , the amount is so minute compared with the total energy that it can be neglected for all practical purposes . Neither theory explains how the matter , which is necessarily involved in the theory , is created . There are many other unanswered questions concerning the details of each of the predominant theories . Although many questions have been answered to the satisfaction of everyone concerned now , future developments may prove the answers to be erroneous . Figure a may help in understanding how it may be determined which theory is correct , although it may take considerable time for the events to occur that will permit this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universe and call this a representative point , O. This will establish a certain rate of expansion . Even though we know that the earth is not at the center of the universe , we can assume that the rate of expansion of the universe is proportional to the velocity with which the selected galaxy is receding from the earth . This velocity can be measured by means of the redshift . If  | the rate of expansion is increasing , it means that the galaxy , which we have initially observed as at point 0 , may at some later time be at point A at an increased recession velocity and an increased distance from the earth , indicating an infinite universe . If , on the other hand , we find at some later time that the galaxy is at point B at a decreased recession velocity , even though at an increased distance from the earth , a finite pulsating universe is indicated . Or the galaxy may be at point C , indicating a finite universe at a constant rate of expansion . To observe a change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same galaxy , a considerable period of time must elapse . However , with powerful radio telescopes and large optical telescopes , the capability exists for detecting distant , large redshift objects . If it can be determined that a large number of distant quasi-stellar sources and quasi-stellar blue galaxies ( see Chapter V ) lie along either OA , OB , or OC , an estimate can be made of which theory is most likely correct . From the limited number of observations that have been made to date of these distant objects , it appears that the rate of expansion is decreasing , and the objects lie along OB , indicating a finite , pulsating universe . If this be true , the expansion will eventually stop , reverse itself , and begin figure  | to contract , eventually coming together again in one big atom , a big-bang explosion taking place , and the cycle will be repeated . Many of the planned space projects for the future will aid in clarifying uncertainties . The light reaching the earth from distant galaxies is quite dim . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth , it is even dimmer . This makes observations of distant galaxies difficult . Radio telescopes have equal difficulty in " looking " at galaxies at great distances due to profuse radio noise . An astronomical observatory , orbiting the earth outside the earth 's atmosphere , could make much clearer observations of the galaxies and possibly be able to determine which corollary of the expanding universe theory is correct by a means other than that discussed above . If it can be determined that the distribution of galaxies at great distances is of uniform density , this will support the corollary of continuous creation , that is , as the galaxies were created , expansion took place from some point in time so that the density of galaxies remained uniform . On the other hand , if it is determined that the distribution of galaxies at great distances is less dense , it would indicate that galaxies were created once and for all and simply expand from some point in time with no addition of material . From an astronomical laboratory in space it might also be possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and determine whether any planets exist there . And from many of our other space projects it may be possible to obtain answers to specific quesnuns that when pieced together will give us insight into the origin of the universe . If these answers support one of our current theories for the origin of the universe , they must also account for all of the known characteristics , properties , and motions of the universe . Some of the questions that must be answered are listed below . They are divided into two categories : those applying to the universe in general and those applying specifically to the solar system . The Universe in General 1 . The stars , including our own sun , are almost spherical in shape . Why is this ? The growth of various types of bodies on earth ( crystals , for example ) are very rarely spherical.  | 2 . What is the distribution of the elements in space , and what is the reason for this distribution ? 3 . Although there are various hypotheses for the formation of stars , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process ? 4 . Why do some stars have strong magnetic fields and others do not ? 5 . In addition to the multitude of single stars there are a number of double and triple stars . What causes multiple star systems ? 6 . There are various explanations of how galaxies came into existence . Which is the true explanation ? 7 . Were all of the stars formed at the same time ? What are the actual ages of the stars , galaxies , and the universe ? At present we have only estimates , which vary considerably depending upon the method used to make the estimate . 8 . Galaxies have been classified as elliptical , spiral , or irregular . Spiral galaxies are further classified as having open arms , tightly wound or barred . What are the causes of these various forms ? Can the variations in the galactic forms be attributed to differences in conditions at the time of formation or are the different types various stages of evolutionary changes ? 9 . What accounts for the variation in hydrogen content from 20 percent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various types of spiral galaxies ? 10 . What happens to the radiation , traveling at the velocity of light , that is emitted by the stars ? Is it lost forever in space ? 11 . What lies beyond the boundary of the observable universe , more than ten billion light-years away ? 12 . When we estimate the age of the universe , does this represent t=0 or did there exist something before this ? 13 . What are the physical mechanics that generate the radio signals that come from the stars and galaxies ? 14 . Cosmic rays are energetic nuclear particles that are found throughout interplanetary space . They reach the earth 's atmosphere from all directions . What is their origin ? 15 . What are the nuclear processes that result in high gamma rays and x-rays ? The Solar System Any theory that successfully accounts for the origin of the universe must , of course , account for the motions and properties of the various components of the universe such as our solar system . The motions of the planets have been readily observed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to be easily predictable . What causes these motions ?  | 1 . Why are the orbits of the planets nearly co-planar ? 2 . Why are the planetary orbits nearly in the plane of the sun 's rotation ? 3 . Why are the orbits of the planets , although slightly elliptical , nearly circular ? 4 . Why is the direction of revolution of all of the planets the same and in the same direction as the sun 's rotation ? 5 . Why do the planetary satellites follow essentially the same basic pattern as that of the planets ? 6 . Why are the angular momenta of the planets greater than that of the sun ? The sun retains only about 2 percent of the angular momentum of the original gas or galactic cloud from which it was formed . The planet Jupiter alone has about 60 percent of the total angular momentum of the solar system ? the four largest planets having nearly 98 percent . 7 . What is the reason for the varying number of satellites for the different planets ? Mercury and Venus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mercury have an appreciably higher density than the moon although their sizes are approximately the same ? 9 . Are meteors , comets , and interplanetary dust leftover fragments of pre-solar-system material ? 10 . Why do the larger of the satellites of other planets not have satellites of their own ? 11 . What is the reason for the axial tilt of Uranus ? 12 . Why is the orbital plane of Pluto tilted so much ? 13 . What is the explanation for the difference in the physical characteristics of Pluto as compared with the other planets ? 14 . What accounts for the differences in mass , density , structure , and composition between the four inner planets and the outer ones ? 15 . What is the exact composition and structure of each planet ? 16 . What are the exact ages of the earth and the solar system ? 17 . What is the reason for the eleven-year sunspot cycles ? 18 . What causes a solar flare ? 19 . How are the energetic particles in space accelerated to such high energies ? 20 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun . They are the photosphere , the chromosphere , and the corona . The photosphere is a thin layer around the sun , approximately two hundred and twenty miles thick . Nearly all of the sun 's radiation is emitted from the photosphere . The chromosphere is a region 6,300 to 9,400 miles-thick immediately above the photosphere . This region can be observed with a coronagraph . The corona of the sun may extend beyond the earth 's orbit . Its shape varies with the solar cycle . At the time of maximum sunspot activity , its structure is nearly the same at the equator and poles .  | At minimum sunspot activity the corona is extended over the equatorial region . What processes take place in these regions ? 21 . What would a continuous measurement of the radiation from the sun prove ? 22 . What would a spectrometric study of the sun , from the x-ray region to that of the ultraviolet region prove ? 23 . What is the nature of the atmospheric cover of Venus ? Carbon dioxide is present in enormous quantities for certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 . Was Mercury once a satellite of Venus ? 25 . What is the cause of the red spot in the atmosphere of Jupiter ? 26 . The planets all rotate on their axes in a counter-clockwise direction , and most of the planetary satellites also orbit about their parent planets in a counter-clockwise direction . The exceptions , are the three outer satellites of Jupiter ( Callisto VIII , IX , and XII ) , the outer satellite of Saturn ( Phoebe ) , four of the satellites of Uranus ( Ariel , Unbriel , Titania , and Oberon ) , and the larger of the two satellites of Neptune ( Triton ) . They orbit about their respective planets in a retrograde direction ; that is , they circle about their parent planets in a clockwise direction . What is the reason for this difference ? 27 . What is the composition of the rings of Saturn ? 28 . Are the two small moons of Mars natural ones or artificial ones launched by an ancient , advanced civilization on Mars ? 29 . Another basic question concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrogen to helium may heat the sun enough to burn inhabitants of the solar system rather than freeze them as the sun " dies " and no more heat radiates . The conversion of hydrogen to helium may cause the sun to gradually increase in size , first encompassing Mercury , then Venus , and finally Earth . The inhabitants of the earth may be forced to migrate to a planet of a younger stellar system , if one can be found , before conditions become intolerable on the earth . 30 . There is a very basic question in connection with the solar system : were the planets formed as a result of a cataclysmic event or were they by-products of the process from which the sun was formed ?  | EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE IN THE preceding chapter the nature of the universe and its origin was discussed . Whether there is intelligent life elsewhere in the universe is a question that has long interested the inhabitants of earth . There are also other questions . If there is intelligent life elsewhere , at what stage is its evolution ? Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more advanced ? Has its evolution resulted in the same form of being or is this life of a much different appearance ? These are questions of long standing and may not be answered for many generations . It is fairly certain that even if intelligent life is present elsewhere in the universe , it would have to have started at the same time as ours in order to be at the same stage of development as ours . The questions concerning extraterrestrial life have again been raised in the recent past by certain radio emanations from space . Are these natural physical emanations from an unknown astronomical source or are they attempts by intelligent beings elsewhere in the universe to communicate with us ? If the latter be true , is it possible that our level of intelligence is too low to understand these communications or too low to grasp the key that would enable us to decode the messages ? If the emanations are from natural causes , is it still possible that intelligent life exists elsewhere but has determined that our intelligence is too low for it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent life developed elsewhere but that climatic or other environmental conditions caused it to die ? Another possibility is that intelligent life is present elsewhere but that it has not developed as far as ours and the inhabitants have not yet discovered radio waves . The case for intelligent life elsewhere in the universe has been  | treated extensively over a period of many years . As early as 1908 Percival Lowell advanced the possibility of extraterrestrial life . Many other scientists since have contributed to this theory , notably H. Spencer Jones , Hubertus Strughold , Harlow Shapley , I. S. Shlovskii , and Carl Sagan . It is intended to present here only a summary , in three parts , of the case for intelligent life elsewhere in the universe , based on the following : 1 . A statistical analysis . 2 . An overall analysis of the type of environment that is necessary to support our type of life and a comparison with the environment that is known to exist on other solar bodies . 3 . An evaluation of the desirable range of environmental conditions for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that determine the possibility for a human environment and which , therefore , will finally lend credibility to the theory that there is intelligent life elsewhere in the universe . A STATISTICAL ANALYSIS There are nine known large planets orbiting around the sun . To date , no planets have been visually detected in any other stellar systems due to the great distances between them and earth . The reflected light from such planets would be so faint that even our largest telescopes could not detect it . Another way of stating the problem is that the glare of the stars hides it . From observations of the perturbed orbit of certain stars over a number of years , it is quite certain that some stars do have planets but none have been directly observed . Another factor contributing to the belief that there are planets in other stellar systems is the fact that some stars are less dense than others , a factor causing them to rotate more slowly . This could indicate that some of the original angular momentum has been transferred to a planetary system . A statistical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the premise that if one star in the universe ( our sun , a very ordinary star ) , with nine planets , has one planet that supports life , the probability that there are other inhabited planets in the universe should be quite high . Just what an appropriate percentage is , no one knows , but it could be very high . One estimate has been made that there are one billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy alone that have habitable planets . At the other end of the scale , perhaps there  | are no other planets that support life , and the earth is unique in the universe . If there are planets elsewhere , the manner in which they were formed would have considerable bearing on whether or not life exists . If they were formed at the same time as the star about which they orbit , the chances of there being intelligent life are higher than if they were formed by the attraction of another star passing near sometime during the early formative phase . Many noted biologists contend that life can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astronomical conditions for life and the specific environmental conditions necessary for our type of life are discussed in the next two sections . In order to state some figures , one might conjecture as follows : if it is assumed that there are one hundred quintillion stars within a sphere having a radius of one billion light-years , if only one in one hundred of these are single stars like our own sun , if only one in one hundred of these has planets , if only one in one hundred of these has a planet similar to earth , and only one in one hundred of these has the correct temperature and chemistry to support a life such as that on earth , this would still amount to a total of one trillion planets that could support life such as ours . At the other extreme , it could just as easily be conjectured that in this large sphere that contains one hundred quintillion stars , only one planet could support life . This one would be the earth which would , of course , then be the only inhabited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of so many possibilities , it seems a little conceited to assume that the planet on which we live is unique in the universe . The actual number of planets which exist and , of these , the number that are habitable , is still very questionable . Perhaps at this point it will be well to take a look at the other two factors as mentioned above . ENVIRONMENT OF SOLAR BODIES The predominant factors that must be considered in determining whether our type of life may be supported or not on other planets are the following : temperature , composition and pressure of the atmosphere , gravity , light , radiation , water , and food . Let us take a brief look at the environmental conditions that are known about the solar planets and other solar bodies .  | The four planets that are smaller than the earth ? Mercury , Venus , Mars and Pluto ? are similar to the earth in density . Based on water=i , the density ranges from the density of the earth of about S.5 to slightly over 4 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to as the terrestrial planets . As their densities are similar , it may also be assumed that their compositions are similar . The other four planets ? Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus and Neptune ? are much larger than the earth . Uranus and Neptune have diameters more than three times that of the earth , and Saturn and Jupiter have diameters nine and eleven times the diameter of the earth , respectively . Their densities range from 0.71 to about 2.5 . If all the terrestrial planets were inner planets and the orbits of all the low-density planets were outside these , an attempt might be made to attach some significance to this . However , although the four innermost planets are terrestrial planets and the next four are low-density planets , the outermost planet , Pluto , is a terrestrial planet . Pluto The orbits of most of the planets are very nearly in the same plane , although Pluto 's orbit is inclined at over 17 ' to that of the earth . And while most of the planetary orbits are very nearly circular , the orbits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's elliptical orbit cuts inside that of Neptune , and some astronomers believe that it may once have been part of Neptune or possibly a satellite of Neptune . It may have been an object which entered the sun 's gravitational field from outside and was permanently captured . Or it may have been formed in the same manner as the other solar planets . At the most distant part of its elliptical orbit , Pluto is farther from the sun than any other planet and therefore is extremely cold . An estimate of its average temperature is - 36o ? F. The light illuminating Pluto is approximately the same intensity as the light illuminating a location on earth about fifteen minutes after sunset . To discuss the other solar planets more in detail in order to compare their environments with that of the earth , let us next discuss the innermost planet , Mercury . Mercury Mercury is so small , with a resulting low mass and gravity , that  | an atmosphere can not be sustained . The closeness of its orbit to the sun results in an unbearably high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface of the planet would have been evaporated by the high temperature and then lost to space because of the low gravitational field . Mercury 's speed of revolution about the sun varies because of the ellipticity of its orbit , even though its rotational rate remains constant . Venus Venus is much larger than Mercury , almost as large as the earth , with a gravitational field almost as strong . It is perpetually covered with a thick white atmosphere , largely carbon dioxide . It is not known for certain whether oxygen and water vapor are present in its atmosphere . There are several hypotheses to explain the atmospheric cover of Venus but which one is correct is uncertain . The combination of the thick cover and closeness to the sun produces a greenhouse effect and contributes to the excessively high temperature of approximately 800 ? F which may be incompatible for any type of organic chemistry . Venus rotates slowly at nearly the same rate as its rate of revolution around the sun . An unusual feature is that it appears to rotate in the opposite direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is true , on Venus the sun rises in the west and sets in the east . Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus and Neptune Of the six outer planets , those farthest from the sun , let us discuss Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus , and Neptune together . These four planets are all large in comparison with the earth and have relatively large masses . Their densities , however , are very low , much too low to have a rock-iron composition . It is believed that the composition of Jupiter and Saturn might be as high as eighty percent hydrogen , while Uranus and Neptune might be composed of water , methane , ammonia , and possibly neon . Saturn , for example , in comparison with the earth , has a diameter of 75,000 miles . Its volume is 763 times the volume of the earth , but its mass is only ninetyfive times that of the earth . It is the lightest of the planets per unit of mass . That it has an atmosphere has been determined by the brightness of objects fading slowly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars occulted by the moon pass from view  | sharply , as the moon has no atmosphere which causes the stars to fade slowly . Saturn requires 29.5 years to complete an orbit around the sun at a distance of 886 million miles . A peculiarity has been observed in the atmosphere of Jupiter for at least the last three hundred years . This is a red spot that apparently is not fixed over a geographical location on the surface of Jupiter . The spot drifts backwards and forwards in longitude , sometimes in the direction of rotation , sometimes opposite to it . This motion precludes the idea that the spot is caused by a red glow in the clouds above a volcanic eruption . The cause of the red spot and the cause of its motion are unknown . Mars The Martian environment is definitely more rugged than the environment on earth , but it is not impossible for human survival . The mean temperature on Mars is - 35 ? C ( ? 31 ? F ) as compared with +15 ? C ( 590F ) for the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperatures as high as +25 ? C ( 78 ? F ) have been measured near the Martian equator , although the temperature drops to as low as - 4o ? C ( ? 4o ? F ) at night . On earth , there are areas which also have a low mean temperature ; Antarctica is an example . Some microbial life exists in Antarctica in spite of extremely low temperatures as do a few flowering plants and invertebrate animals . The low density of the Martian atmosphere ( measurements from Mariner IV showed the surface pressure to be much lower than originally thought ? about the equivalent of the earth 's atmospheric pressure at Ioo , 000 feet altitude ) and the lack of a magnetic field allows the surface to be bombarded continuously by cosmic rays and solar radiation . This intense bombardment produces ionization that is several hundred times that on earth . A rad is the amount of radiation producing an energy absorption of one hundred ergs per gram . About twenty millirads per day has been calculated as the dose rate for the Martian surface based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low in comparison with the mean lethal dose of five thousand rads for a typical bacterium . The atmosphere of Mars is believed to contain nitrogen , argon , carbon dioxide , and a varying amount of approximately fourteen  | microns of water vapor , which is about 1/1000 of the amount in our own atmosphere . No surface water exists on Mars , but there are polar icecaps so there may be permafrost beneath the surface . There are some terrestrial animals that can survive with little or no water , a characteristic that must be developed through evolution . It is not a characteristic to which an animal system can adapt simply by transposing the animal from an environment with water to one without water . Kangaroo rats which are prevalent in the Mojave desert of California are an example of animals that can live indefinitely without water . All the water that they need for survival is produced metabolically by the oxidation of carbohydrates . Mars is apparently much drier than the California desert , and many generations of animals would be required to live on restricted amounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolutionary changes that would permit survival in the almost waterless environment of Mars . In the meantime , the water requirements of men will have to be met on Mars either by water found , produced , or transported there . In spite of the apparently adverse environment , life could survive on Mars now and could have survived in the past . It has been decided that missions to Mars will be to determine , first , whether there is life on the planet now or whether life ever existed there , and , second , the origin of this life if it exists or ever existed . Of concern in connection with the second objective , is whether any evidence of life that is found has the same origin as life on earth or is independent . The photographs taken of Mars by Mariner IV are good , but one can not determine from them whether life exists or not . From these photographs it does not seem that the planet supports life of any kind , but on the other hand there is nothing to prove that life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of craters similar to the craters on the moon . A determination of the rate of impact and a comparison with the rate of impact of meteorites on the moon can lead to an estimate of the relative ages of the two bodies . If the rate is determined to be the same , it can be assumed that the two bodies are the same age . This , coupled with the fact that the craters are still visible on Mars , implies that there has been little or no weathering of the surface . As there are no surface  | characteristics indicating that rivers or oceans were ever present , it may be concluded that the planet today is much the same as it has always been , and that life never evolved , or it may be concluded that all signs of early water have vanished . If it is determined that the surface of Mars has been subjected to a much higher rate of meteoric impact than the moon , then it follows that the Martian craters are much younger , and no conclusions can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that fossil remains of highly evolved types of organisms nearly two billion years old have been found on earth , no conclusions should be drawn , on the basis of the evidence now available , that life never evolved on Mars . The seasonal change of color of the mania regions is still unexplained . It may represent the growth of vegetation which would lend support to the theory that there is life on Mars . Satellites Mercury , Venus , and Pluto have no satellites . Quite a bit is known about the earth 's satellite , the moon , because it is close . Comparatively little is known about the satellites of other planets except their size , mass , and density . All the remaining planets have two or more satellites ; Jupiter has twelve , Saturn nine , and Uranus five . The two satellites of Mars are extremely small , but several other satellites are of large enough mass to consider them for future exploration . All the satellites that are farther away from the sun than Mars have the same basic disadvantage as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , may be much easier to visit than the basic planet . The largest of Saturn 's satellites , Titan , with a diameter of nearly three thousand miles , is the only one on which an atmosphere has been detected , although the atmosphere appears to consist of methane and ammonia . Its orbital period is sixteen days at about 759,000 miles from Saturn . One hemisphere of the eighth satellite of Saturn , Iapetus , is five times brighter than the other , suggesting that one hemisphere was sheared flat by a collision . An interesting feature of two of the satellites of Jupiter , Europa and Ganymede , is the large amount of light reflected from them . This may be caused by their surfaces being covered by ice or snow . Ganymede and another satellite of Jupiter , Callisto , are almost as large as Mercury . Two others , Io and Europa , are about as large as the earth 's moon .  | Several theories exist as to the origin of the various satellites . They may have been formed at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have been captured , or it is possible that they may be fragments resulting from a collision of celestial bodies . The Moon The moon is larger in relation to the earth than the other satellites of the solar system in relation to their planets . The moon 's orbit comes as close to the earth as 221,000 miles and is 253,000 miles away at the farthest point in its orbit . Its effect on the earth causes the earth to trace a wavy path around the sun . As the moon rotates about its axis at the same rate that it revolves about the earth it always keeps approximately the same hemisphere toward the earth . This results in a long daytime and nighttime , each lasting fourteen days , one-half the time required to orbit the earth . Extremes of temperature result , reaching - 270 ? F at night and +210 ? F during the day . The moon has almost no atmosphere . The terrain is apparently quite undulant , pockmarked with numerous craters . It is believed that there is no magnetic field about the moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak . DESIRABLE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS ON THE PLANETS OF OTHER STARS , AND ASTRONOMICAL FACTORS THAT MUST BE CONSIDERED Let us first take a look at the range of environmental conditions that are considered desirable for life on the planets of other stars . Temperature Humans have existed for periods of time at or near the North or South Poles in subzero temperatures with appropriate protection ; other humans have existed at temperatures approaching oo ? F. A survey made of the geographical locations in which the world 's human population resides indicates that the bulk of the population lives in regions where the mean annual temperature is between 3o ? F and 8o ? F. This range of temperature is also desirable for crops and animals on which man depends for food . Temperature is , of course , not the only factor used by man in deciding where to live , but it does have a major influence ; therefore , a desirable temperature range for another planet would be 30 ? to 8o ? F.  | Composition and Pressure of the Atmosphere For our type of life it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If this oxygen is breathed at too low a pressure , an oxygen deficiency results ( hypoxia ) , and there is insufficient oxygen for the blood , cells , and tissues . If the pressure is too high , toxicity results ( too much oxygen ) . There are people in Tibet and the Chilean Andes who live permanently at high altitudes and do vigorous work . Acceptable limits of inspired oxygen partial pressure have been established as 6o mm Hg minimum and 400 mm Hg maximum . These limits are fixed regardless of the absolute pressure and regardless of the percentage of oxygen in the air being breathed . However , as the percentage of oxygen becomes higher , the acceptable inspired partial pressure may be experienced at lower absolute barometric pressures . While it is necessary that breathable oxygen be present in a sufficient percentage and at a suitable pressure , it is also essential that the percentage of a number of harmful gases be kept at a tolerable level . The most toxic of these gases are chlorine , fluorine , hydrogen chloride , ozone , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gases that are toxic in high concentrations . Gravity Human beings have been subjected to tests on centrifuges at various continuous g-levels . As accelerations reach higher values , blackouts occur at lower durations . For example , 3 g 's can be tolerated for about an hour without a blackout , but 4 g 's can be tolerated for only about eight minutes . The tolerance for 5 g 's decreases to about two minutes . The tolerances vary with the person , the direction of the g-force , and the manner in which the body is supported , but the tolerances indicated are typical . Performing a task under g-loading becomes increasingly difficult as the g-level is raised and the test subjects become more easily fatigued . For example , under a i-g transverse loading , it takes about seventeen seconds to put on a parachute ; under 3 g 's the time required increases to seventy-five seconds . Positive g 's in the range of 2 to 4 g 's tend to force the blood to the lower extremities , and the heart rate is increased considerably . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blood to the upper extremities and is very nearly intolerable .  | Centrifuge tests do not accurately duplicate the high linear accelerations that might be encountered on some unknown large planets , but it has been concluded as a result of numerous tests that man would not choose to live on a planet where the surface gravity were greater than 25 to 50 percent more than that experienced on earth . Short exploratory visits would be acceptable at high g 's but not continuous living . Man can survive at high g-levels , and he can adapt to the situation , but it is uncomfortable . He would not choose to live under a high g-condition unless it were absolutely necessary . Light Illumination is directly associated with heat which may come from the same source ? the star about which the planet in question revolves . For plant growth , photosynthesis must also be considered . For photosynthesis to be effective it must take place under conditions of light and heat similar to those on earth . If the illumination is too low the rate of photosynthesis will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lumens per square centimeter . Fifteen lumens per square centimeter is approximately the maximum encountered at the surface of the earth . A range of around . oz to 30 lumens is the maximum range that could be considered to produce plant growth equivalent to that on earth . The period of illumination and the temperature should also be similar to that on earth . Radiation The surface of the earth is continuously bombarded by radiation particles . Relatively high dosages are allowable without causing death , but relatively low continuous dosages can result in genetic effects . Exactly how much is allowable is unknown , but it is fairly certain that one roentgen per year will do no harm . There are various ways of expressing radiation dosage , but the most common unit is the roentgen . RBE ( relative biological effectiveness ) and REM ( roentgen equivalent man ) are the measurements which are used . R FM is simply RBE times the absorbed energy . A REM is defined as the quantity of radiation of any type which when absorbed by man produces an effect equivalent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The natural background radiation on the earth 's surface may be as high as .00I roentgen per day . The tolerance for  | workers in atomic energy plants is .3 roentgens per week , an amount which is more than forty times the natural radiation rate . Although this amounts to nearly four hundred roentgens in twenty-five years , exposure to this level of radiation over a short period of time will cause serious illness or death . Twelve roentgens per year is believed to be safe . Water and Food In addition to the preceding conditions for a planet to be habitable , there must be a source of water and food . If water is available , and all other conditions are met , plant growth is possible . With plant growth and water , animal life is possible and , of course , with both animals and plants , food is available for man . Water is an essential prerequisite to life , and a habitable planet must have large bodies of water in order to support extensive evaporation and precipitation . The planet , however , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which plants can grow and animals can live . Exposed water is a natural means of controlling humidity . There is a level of humidity that is most desirable for comfort , and this level varies with the temperature . Low humidity associated with a high temperature leads to uncomfortable physiological effects such as drying of the mucous membranes of the nose , mouth , and throat . High humidity can also have adverse results . Astronomical Factors These factors , which affect the probability of the existence of intelligent life , may be divided into positional properties and intrinsic properties . Both types of properties contribute to conditions that either lead to an environment that is habitable or to one that is not . Positional properties are those that involve the orbit of a planet about a star , its eccentricity , inclination , and distance from and property of the star around which the planet is orbiting . The intrinsic properties are age , mass , and rotational rate of the planet . Positional Properties The estimates of allowable ranges in positional properties have been made by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth . Eccentricity of an orbit must not be more than about .2 because anything greater than this would result in extremes  | of temperature that would be unacceptable . The inclination of the equator of a planet with respect to the plane of its orbit affects both the illumination and temperature levels . The degree of illumination and temperature will also vary depending upon the size of the star and its distance from the planet . Generally speaking , the level of illumination at low orbit inclinations should be not less than o.6 nor more than 1.4 times the normal illumination for the earth . Under certain conditions , nearly twice the normal earth illumination is permissible at high orbital inclinations . As a planet orbits about a star , the motion of the star is perturbed . From the degree of perturbation and the nature of the perturbation , it can be determined how large the planet is that is causing the perturbation ( its mass ) and the type of orbit , that is , whether it is circular or elliptical and the degree of ellipticity . Astronomers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years . A number of stars have been determined to have one or more planets orbiting about them ; examples of six within a distance of twenty light-years from the earth are shown in Table II together with the estimated mass of the major planet and its distance from the earth . STARS WITH PLANETS figure In considering the intrinsic properties , the age of the planet is important because several billion years are thought to be necessary for the evolution of an intelligent life form and for the production of a suitable atmosphere . The question is whether a planet has been formed long enough for this to have taken place . The mass of a planet is important from the standpoint of retaining the suitable atmosphere once it is produced . If the mass is too  | small , the gravitational effect is too low , and the atmosphere will be lost to space . If the mass is too great , the gravitational effect will be too high , and although it is possible that life forms could develop under high g-forces , they would tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they would have stronger constitutions in general . Certain types of disorders would be more serious and certain types of injuries and accidents more critical . The rate of rotation of a planet affects the range of daytime to nighttime temperatures . If the rate of rotation is too low , excessively high and excessively low temperatures result ; the length of the day-night cycle would be such that life forms could not live through the long hot days and the long cold nights . It can be seen that each of the estimated masses of the major planets listed in Table II is many times the mass of the earth and larger even than that of our largest solar planet , Jupiter . The smallest planet that has been detected in this manner is the closest to us . It is entirely possible that there are many more of smaller size that are as yet undetected . And there are , no doubt , many more planets that are farther away ; possibly many are orbiting about stars that are beyond the range of our most powerful telescopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these planets are habitable , but as more of them become known , the greater is the probability that some of them will be habitable . If they are habitable now and the conditions have been conducive to supporting life forms , it is quite likely that some of these planets will have life on them . Whether there is life and , if so , whether it is intelligent is indeterminable at the present time . These questions will no doubt remain the most intriguing space questions for many years . It is obvious that in order for there to be life on planets beyond our solar system , such planets must exist . In this chapter a good case has been presented that there are planets beyond our solar system , although none have yet been seen . This should not deter us from trying to confirm the circumstantial evidence . No one has ever seen an atom or an electron either , but no one doubts that they exist . Man will eventually be able to confirm the existence of other planets and even determine whether they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this either by propelling himself farther into space than ever before or by the use of better  | telescopes . It is more likely that both of these will occur . Telescopes will be improved and will be located outside the earth 's atmosphere either on a space station or on the moon , and man will be at the same sites to use them . In the meantime , missions to or near our solar planets will continue to add to and refine the information known about our solar environment and eventually determine whether life exists elsewhere in our solar system .  | WHY EXPLORE SPACE ? IF A SINGLE prime objective could be stated for the United States ' exploration of space , it would be something like to maintain the preeminence of the United States in space . However , in order to achieve this , it will be necessary to maintain preeminence in each of several separate areas : political , military , scientific-technical , and commercial . In each of these areas a number of smaller , more specific objectives can be stated . Examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and domestic ) Demonstrate United States leadership in space technology . Provide stimulus for national pride . Strengthen international goodwill and cooperation . Provide stimulus for increased foreign trade . Military Demonstrate the capability of the military man to operate in space . Demonstrate the overall United States military competence in space . Develop and test military applications . Strengthen military competence in technical management . Strengthen the military-industrial base . Provide a means for arms control . Commercial Develop and test commercial applications . Strengthen the national industrial base . Provide access to extraterrestrial resources . Provide a rapid global transportation system . Provide an unmanned space transportation system . Provide a manned space transportation system . Scientific-technical Gain knowledge about the universe and life in general .  | Gain knowledge about the earth 's atmosphere . Gain knowledge about the earth 's magnetic and radiation environment . Strengthen national educational facilities . It is difficult to establish priorities for the above single objectives . All are important , and if all are attained it is certain that our overall objective of maintaining the preeminence of the United States in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although our objective is not to beat the Russians to the moon , a certain amount of international prestige is certain to result if the United States is successful in performing a manned round trip to the moon before the Russians . In the military area , our objective is not to exploit a known military potential . If new techniques are uncovered that appear to have potential military application , these will certainly be developed . The experience of the military in operating space vehicles for any purpose will be beneficial . If a potential enemy produces any sort of military breakthrough from space operations , our own military will be in a better position to counteract if it has operational experience . A number of commercial applications also hold military significance : world communications , meteorology , weather forecasting , navigation , and geology . In the commercial area , the system of global communications satellites is probably second in importance to only the manned spaceflight program . Following closely upon this are the worldwide satellite weather-reporting systems that are highly successful . The scientific-technical area is where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years ago , astronomers carried the brunt of the exploration of space . Their task has been extremely difficult as their research has , of necessity , always been conducted through the thick diffusing layer of atmosphere surrounding the earth . It has been impossible for astronomers to set up laboratory experiments as physicists and chemists do . It has been impossible for them to obtain samples of celestial bodies to determine their composition . They have even needed to determine the temperature of these bodies remotely . Now that the means are available to land spacecraft on the moon and to either land on or make close flybys of other celestial bodies , what information  | do we want and why do we want it ? In addition to obtaining some of the answers that we are looking for , it is almost certain that some information will be obtained that is not even anticipated now . Serendipity is well known and welcome to all research scientists and engineers . New knowledge for its own sake is sufficient motivation for the true research scientist . Knowledge of space medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a better understanding of human physiology and life processes . In the scientific-technical area , the field of quasars is one that might lend itself to investigation by means of spacecraft . An entirely new hypothesis regarding the origin of the universe might be developed . The word quasars was coined by astronomers to identify the sources of extraordinarily strong radio waves from space that were not initially thought to come from stars or galaxies as none could be located in the direction indicated by the radio telescopes . Thus , the sources were called quasi-stellar . The interest in quasars originated over a decade ago when radio telescopes first found sources of strong radio waves which were recorded at areas in the sky not identified with galaxies . Radio telescopes are antennae capable of collecting radio waves and focusing their energy in a manner similar to that of optical telescopes which collect and focus light . Each , of course , must have the appropriate instruments for recording the information received , that is , a radio receiver or camera , respectively . At first the radio waves were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources did later turn out to be galaxies when powerful optical telescopes were directed toward them after a precise direction was indicated by accurate radio telescopes , but others were at best dim stars , not galaxies . The radio output from them has been determined to be in the range of from io33 to io3S watts , as compared with a normal output of ioJ ? to Io32 watts . Astronomers are at a loss for an explanation of the large quantity and strength of the radio waves from these sources . Very faint wisps or jets can sometimes be distinguished on photographic plates . Emission lines from spectra identified as coming from a quasar show similarities to the emission lines of planetary nebulae . The lines are often very broad and have a very  | large redshift . The major differences in the quasar sources and galaxies are as follow : 1 . Quasars are much smaller than galaxies . Their radio diameters are as small as one inch . 2 . Quasars emit perhaps as much as one hundred times more radio energy than galaxies. 3 . Quasars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation of quasars was made even more difficult when the spectra of several of the radio-loud stars were photographed with the two hundred-inch Palomar Mountain telescope . It was found that the originally emitted ultraviolet light had decreased in wavelength until it became visible . By this means , it was determined that the objects causing the radio waves were moving away from the earth at velocities ranging from 5o percent to more than 8o percent of the velocity of light . Using the rule of the expanding universe that the speed of recession is proportional to the distance , it has been calculated that these far-distant quasars are four billion to fifteen billion light-years away from the earth . To furnish enough light to be visible at this distance would require the equivalent of fifty to one hundred galaxies , each composed of billions of stars . Scientists have been unable to account for the tremendous energy necessary to create such brilliance and to transmit the radio signals received over such great distances . It has been estimated that the energy from some quasars comes from an area much smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , has a diameter less than 1/15,000 that of the Milky Way , although wisps of matter stretch out into space as much as 200 , - 000 light-years . Some astronomers believe that this is an indication of a massive explosion that took place in the distant past . Other objects , which emit no radio signals , have been discovered in the distant sky . In other respects they resemble quasars , although they outnumber quasars five hundred to one . They are called quasi-stellar blue galaxies . Until very recently many were thought to be blue stars in the outer regions of our own galaxy . Now they are known to be at tremendous distances from the earth . If it can be determined over a period of time whether these objects are accelerating , decelerating , or moving away from the earth at a constant rate , it might be possible to determine which  | theory of the expanding universe is correct . Measurements of a few of the recently observed quasars and a few of the quasistellar blue galaxies indicate that the expansion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theory of a cyclic expansion . According to this theory , expansion began with the explosion of a big atom , the resulting expansion gradually decelerating , reversing , finally contracting again into a big atom , and another explosion taking place . It has been estimated that this complete cycle would take about eighty billion years ? forty billion years to expand and then another forty billion years to contract . The universe then is ten billion to fifteen billion years along on the forty billion-year expansion cycle . The shape of the universe resulting from such a process would most logically be spherical . However , it could be the shape of a disk or even the shape of a kidney bean . Another type of phenomenon has been discovered around one end of the spiral galaxy M81 . This is a faint luminous ring about ioo , 000 light-years in diameter ( 600,000,000,000,000,000 miles ) and was first observed by Halton C. Arp of the Mount Wilson and Mount Palomar Observatories . It is conjectured that it is a plasma ring of charged particles that were ejected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from the source of the explosion , began to shine in the magnetic field of the galaxy M81 . This is probably evidence of material being ejected from one galaxy to another and probably also evidence of an overall magnetic field of a spiral galaxy . M81 and M82 are about sixty quintillion miles ( ten million light-years ) from the earth . The total energy of a typical quasar in particles and magnetic field probably lies in the range of r o57 to i o ? l ergs . An early conjecture , that of a collision between two galaxies , has been discarded as a possibility ; nuclear mechanisms can not account for more than 1o52 ergs in the conversion of one solar mass of hydrogen to helium . An incident that has contributed further to the difficulty in explaining quasars is the change in radio source 3Cz . This was first photographed as a dim reddish object . Two years later it was photographed again at which time it was four times as brilliant as it had been previously , and blue instead of red . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a quasar .  | No one can conceive of a process that can produce such a change in such a short period of time . A situation that might explain the high energy of quasars is gravitational collapse at the speed of light . One might account for 1o53 ergs of energy in this manner ; however , the reason for the gravitational collapse of a large quantity of matter is unknown . Neither can a reason be given for a rapid nuclear burning . Galaxies with negative masses could also explain the high energy , although such a concept is completely foreign to anything that is known today . Another possible explanation for quasars is associated with the production of new hydrogen atoms . As a stellar mass is increased by the addition of new atoms , some of the mass may be thrown off into space , forming a new galaxy . Is it possible that the tremendous energy is released as the new galaxy is born ? Quasars have been found to vary in brilliance as much as io percent per month . Whatever the reason for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is caused by some type of catastrophic occurrence , perhaps an explosion in the nucleus of a galaxy that could have been set off by a shock wave . Since the light variation has been observed , the eighty-five-foot parabolic antenna at the University of Michigan has been used for measurements of the flux densities of a number of nonthermal radio sources . Special attention has been given to radio source 3C273 in an effort to detect any variation in its radio emission . Evidence was collected over approximately a three-year period of a steady increase of 40 percent in the radio emission of 3C273 at eight thousand me/second . The proportion of very distant sources of radio noise to the total number of sources is much higher than one would expect from a purely statistical analysis . Does this fact have any significance in solving the riddle of the origin of the universe ? The number of quasars that have been identified to date is approaching one hundred , and more are continually being identified . Many , however , may never be identified because they are too far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those most commonly known are 3C2 , 3C9 , 3C47 , 3C48 , 3C147 , 3Ci96 , 3C216 , 3C245 , 3C248 , 3C273 , 3C279 , 3C286 , 3C287 , 3C345 , and CTA102 . The preceding lie in a plane that is believed to be tilted slight. -  | ly away from the plane of the Milky Way galaxy . This characteristic causes additional questions such as the following : 1 . Do quasars have an arrangement or plan in the universe that is distinctly their own ? 2 . Are there physical laws as yet unknown by scientists to account for the increase in shortwave radiation ? Perhaps it is too much to expect that physical laws which hold on earth apply throughout space . Other occurrences have caused scientists to wonder about this . 3 . Is our present concept of the universe only a small part of the real universe ? 4 . Does the real universe simply extend beyond what we presently visualize , or is the universe in the midst of an indeterminate shape , indeterminate , that is , at this time ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explore space . It should be remembered that the light and radio signals that are now received on earth from distant quasars started from their sources hundreds of millions of years ago , perhaps many billions of years ago . Because these quasars are on the edge of our presently observable universe , they may have lived brief ( perhaps only a million years ) and violent lives before the earth was formed , even before the sun was born . Although we do not know for sure what quasars are , it is unlikely that the radio noises can be any type of message from an advanced civilization of the past . It is hard for us to conceive now of any technique that could switch on and off the energy of a hundred billion suns . Optical telescopes mounted on the moon or a stable space-station orbiting the earth may extend the telescopic range sufficiently so that additional clues may be furnished to answer these questions about quasars . Or , there may come a time in the distant future when man can propel himself to distances far enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to obtain the answers firsthand . In the meantime , each bit of knowledge that is obtained about space may be a stepping-stone . There are , of course , many questions about space other than the ones in this chapter . There are many questions whose answers will apply directly to the design of space vehicles that will enable both  | the vehicle and its occupants to be protected against the hazards of space . Space exploration and the search for answers to the origin of the universe reminds one of the extensive biological research of Charles Darwin of the last century and his terrestrial exploration that resulted in his theories on the evolution of man presented in The Origin of the Species . Obviously , to obtain the answers to the origin of the universe will require more extensive research and exploration and consequently a much longer time than Darwin 's investigations required . In space exploration we are concerned with many things related to the origin of the entire universe , whereas Darwin 's research and explorations , extensive as they were , dealt only with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | SPACE MISSIONS T HE PURPOSE of this chapter is to provide the reader with an idea of the typical space missions of the past and present , and the type of scientific information that each was designed to obtain . There will be no attempt to describe in detail all of these missions or their results . Prior to the launching of Sputnik I in October , 1957 , scientific information about space was obtained by astronomers and from sounding-rockets , high-altitude balloon flights , and a few high-altitude , high-speed research aircraft . The early sounding-rockets were capable only of boosting small payloads . Relatively high altitudes were attained but only within the atmosphere . These early rockets were not expected to obtain information about space but to obtain general meteorological information about the atmosphere at a high altitude . The later flights were designed to obtain the effect of high-speed reentries into the atmosphere upon various reentry vehicle shapes and materials . The X-17 is an example of an advanced reentry test vehicle that penetrated through the atmosphere and actually travelled into space . It was instrumented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the atmosphere rather than information on those conditions to be encountered in space . The principal information obtained from space concerned temperature and velocity at various altitudes . High-altitude balloon flights were probably the first missions designed to obtain information about space . Those early flights to altitudes of 90,000 feet and above involved the first attempts to evaluate the biological effects of heavy cosmic ray primary radiation on animals . A number of flights were made in the early 1950 's from  | Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico and later from other sites . Considerable information was obtained on the biological effects on black mice and also the effects on wet and dry seed material . Starting in 1957 a number of manned flights were made in Manhigh balloon capsules to altitudes above ioo , 000 feet . These flights supplied much needed information as to what constituted a satisfactory breathing atmosphere ( the proportion of oxygen , nitrogen , and helium ) , what a comfortable temperature was , and what the pilot 's reactions were to a new environment . A number of astronomical observations were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The X-15 , a rocket-powered aircraft , also capable of probing into the lower fringes of space , was launched to obtain design data at high speeds in the atmosphere . Since the start of the Space Age and development of more sophisticated methods of obtaining information about space , the number of space projects and missions has steadily increased . Since October , 1957 , over one thousand objects have been launched , many of which are still in space , having satisfied their immediate objectives . The technical capability has been developed to accomplish many things in space , but there is still much to be done . There are many celestial bodies to explore to obtain firsthand information and the answers to many questions . More needs to be learned about other solar planets , comets , asteroids , the sun , the immediate environment surrounding each of these bodies , and the environment of the space between them . For centuries man believed that the earth with its blanket of atmosphere orbited in a complete void except for other large bodies . Contrary to that early belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with matter . True , the density is very low , but the variety of matter is great : gas particles ( mostly hydrogen , but some helium , oxygen , sodium , potassium , silicon , calcium , and traces of other materials ) , electrons , dust particles and larger particles ( probably originating from comets and meteors ) , and electromagnetic and corpuscular radiation originating from the sun and other stars . There is a strong scientific desire to learn more about the many unknowns of space , but there is one restraint ? available funds . To  | do everything in space that man is now capable of doing requires a tremendous sum of money . Space programs , projects , and missions must be carefully scrutinized , compared , and evaluated to determine which will contribute the most toward the overall objectives within the limitation of available funds . Early ballistic missile test flights were used to obtain space information . The primary concern of these test flights was to prove the reliability of all components and the overall performance of the missile . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special instrumentation and equipment could be carried . The space used by a warhead in an operational missile and its weight could be used for the instruments and equipment to obtain scientific information . Scientific information about space began to be available in large quantities with the first earth satellites . These satellites were designed to obtain information about the environment through which they orbited , and many bits of information were obtained from each flight . This information was useful in refining the design of future space vehicles , and most of the information also contributed to new concepts on the origin and evolution of the universe . The first satellites were launched with ballistic missile boosters , then with specially modified boosters , and later with boosters specially designed for space vehicle launches . As the capability for launching larger payloads into space improved , more sophisticated missions became possible and more experiments and equipment could be carried . Table III shows the physical characteristics of some representative space launch vehicles and their payload capabilities . Table IV shows weights and dimensions for typical , spacecraft such as Mercury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of space missions have been divided into three categories : scientific , commercial , and military . Several projects from each category have been selected and described in order to illustrate the type of space missions , the instruments and equipment used , and the general arrangement of the experiments . No attempt is made to cover all missions and all types of spacecraft , but a sufficient number are discussed to provide a good indication of the objectives for these flights and the instrumentation and equipment needed to achieve these objectives .  | The Explorer series has been highly successful . This series of scientific satellites started with Explorer I , the first United States satellite , launched on January 31 , 1958 . These satellites were designed to obtain information about the earth 's magnetic field , the interplanetary magnetic sphere , and geomagnetic trapped radiation . The success of this series stimulated space scientists to mount other types of instruments on other earth satellites to obtain additional information . Explorer XIV and XXII are excellent illustrations of the Explorer series . The latest of the series at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May 25 , 1966 . It is in an elliptical orbit with an apogee of 1,629 miles and a perigee of 173 miles at an inclination of 64.7 ? . Explorer XIV Explorer XIV was launched on October 2 , 1962 , at Cape Canaveral ( now Cape Kennedy ) at an inclination to the equator of thirty-three degrees . The three-stage Thor-Delta was used as a launch vehicle with the then uprated DM-21 engine . A highly elliptical orbit with an apogee of 61,190 miles and a perigee of 174 miles was achieved with a period of thirty-six hours and twentyfour minutes . Six experiments were carried . Five were contained in the octagon-shaped satellite which was twenty-nine inches wide  | figure The commercial satellites also have Courier , medium-altitude milicomsat , military applications but in addition , high-altitude milicomsat , Interim Dethere are classified special-purpose fence Communications System , Manned satellites . Orbiting Laboratory ( MOL ) The italicized projects have been selected for brief discussion . and five inches deep . The magnetometer for the sixth experiment was mounted at the end of a shaft protruding from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shape of the earth 's magnetosphere . One of the five internal experiments conducted during this flight was to determine the amount of solar cell-damage caused by direct exposure to radiation .  | The second experiment was designed to measure cosmic rays and various particle radiations encountered by the satellite . To do this , four Geiger counters were used . The third experiment was designed to determine the spectra and flux of low-energy protons beyond 24,000 miles . The energy range was between two and two thousand electron volts . A scintillation telescope was carried for the fourth experiment , which was designed to measure the total cosmic ray proton flux above seven hundred million electron volts and the low-energy portion of the alpha particle spectrum ; low-energy gamma rays , protons from one million electron volts , and incident particles from ten thousand electron volts to twenty million electron volts ; and proton flux above seventy-five million electron volts , electrons above eight hundred electron volts , and cosmic ray flux above seventy-five million electron volts . The fifth experiment utilized an ion-electron detector to measure particle fluxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , and position with respect to the Van Allen radiation belt . The range used was ten thousand electron volts to one million electron volts for ion detection and one thousand to ten thousand electron volts for electron detection ; three thousand electron volts to one million electron volts for proton detection , and one hundred to one thousand electron volts for electron detection . A schematic of the packaging of the Explorer XIV experiments is shown in Figure 3 . Explorer XXII Explorer XXII was launched on October 9 , 1964 , by a Scout launch vehicle . Its apogee was 669 miles and its perigee 549 miles , with a period of 104 minutes and an inclination of eighty degrees . The experiments carried were for the purpose of learning more about the ionosphere and were contained within the 116-pound gross weight of the satellite . Signals were transmitted to eighty ground-stations located in thirty-two countries and could be received by very inexpensive ground-station equipment consisting of an antenna , two radio receivers , a timer , and a recorder , all costing less than $5,000 . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laser beam experiments .  | Figure 3 . Packaging of Explorer 14 Experiments ( reprinted by permission of Aviation Week and Space Technology ) . OGO The orbiting geophysical observatory ( OGO ) is another series of scientific earth satellites with instruments and equipment designed for a wide variety of geophysical and solar experiments . The gross weight of the satellites is in the range of from 1,000 to 1,500 pounds , including from 150 to 220 pounds of experiments varying with the launch vehicle that is used . As much as 65o pounds of experiments may be carried if the Atlas-Centaur launch vehicle is used . A thrust-augmented Thor first-stage was used for the polar orbiting version ( POGO ) . With the Agena B second stage , an orbital altitude of from 16o to 575 nautical miles was achieved . A more highly elliptical or eccentric orbit of from 175 to 92,721 nautical miles was achieved with the more powerful Atlas-Agena D combination ( EOGO ) launched in September , 1964 . The period was 621 %2 hours . Twenty to fifty experiments may be carried  | figure  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay the groundwork for the Apollo program . The project serves as a bridge between these two programs . The Gemini capsule looks very much like the Mercury capsule , externally , but it is larger . The major systems are located outside the pressure vessel so that they can be serviced or replaced easily . The design was frozen and advances and sophistication applied to the Apollo design . Reaction-control fuel and oxygen are carried in the adapter section . The adapter is also used as a radiator to cool the crew compartment . The coolant liquid is circulated through hollow structural stringers in the adapter . Eight maneuver-control thrust chambers and six attitude-control jets are located in the adapter . The maneuver-control units are one hundred pounds of thrust each , and the attitude-control units are twenty-five pounds of thrust each . The adapter section remains attached to the spacecraft until the mission is completed , and at the end of the mission it is jettisoned by a shaped charge between the reentry module and the adapter . The reaction-control jets for use in maneuvering and attitudecontrol use bipropellant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxides of nitrogen as the oxidizer . These propellants are stored in a manner that permits them to come in contact with each other after the vehicle has been injected into orbit . The thrust chambers are fixed . A special arrangement of solenoid valve controls eliminates tailoff and permits extremely short thrust pulses . The reentry vehicle houses the pressurized crew-compartment . The electronics gear and major systems are located between the pressure compartment and the spaceframe . The primary power system for the spacecraft is supplied by a six-module fuel cell system which delivers up to from i , 600 to 1,700 watts . The environmental control is located within the pressure compartment . This system furnishes pure oxygen and maintains a pressure of five pounds per square inch , absolute . The system vents overboard and has all of the major fixtures of the Mercury system . Carbon dioxide concentration is controlled by charcoal absorption . Temperature is controlled with a heat exchanger and the humidity by water removal downstream from the heat exchanger.  | The oxygen needed in orbit and reentry comes from two independent systems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the tanks for the other system are in the reentry module . The pressure suits for both pilots are connected to the same pressure system ; therefore , the pilots must agree upon the setting . The reentry capsule contains access doors for servicing and replacing equipment . This overcomes one of the difficulties of the Mercury capsule . In case of faulty operation during countdown on the Mercury capsule , the entire capsule had to be removed in order to replace or repair a major system . The reentry reaction-control system structure is in front of the reentry module . If a paraglider is used , its stowage and that of the rendezvous radar system are still farther forward . The maneuvering controls , a displaced center of gravity , and the paraglider system make the Gemini spacecraft an operational vehicle that is capable of positive pilot control in orbit and during and after reentry . The displaced center of gravity of the capsule permits the attainment of an L/D ( lift-to-drag ratio ) of 0.25 at an angle of 16 ? to the atmosphere upon reentry . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fiberglass and phenolic resin is used . A nonuniform thickness is used to shield against hot spots . Paragliders are still experimental but after all of the bugs are worked out the use of a paraglider can permit a landing anywhere within a predetermined strip five hundred miles long and two hundred miles wide . It has a maximum L/D of 3.2 and is capable of maneuvering twenty-five miles downwind or fifteen miles upwind . The landing is controlled by cable reels operated by nitrogen or other cold gas . Two cable reels are used to vary pitch , two for roll , and a fifth is fixed . The landing is accomplished in the following five steps : 1 . Deployment of the paraglider is started at 50,000 feet and completed at 40,000 feet . 2 . The paraglider glides down to an altitude of 390 feet . The forward velocity at this point is 68 ft/sec at a sink-rate of 20.4 ft/sec. 3 . At 390 feet a preflare is initiated . This maneuver is a dive which increases the forward velocity to ninety-six ft/sec and the sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? . The preflare is held to an altitude of forty-five feet . 4 . From an altitude of forty-five feet to impact , the flare takes place  | by increasing the spacecraft angle to -8 ? , the forward velocity to sixty-eight ft/sec. 5 . Touchdown is made at sixty-eight ft/sec and a vertical velocity of not more than five ft/sec . The landing distance is two hundred feet for an average surface . Heat-treated steel landing-skids are used . The Mercury manned-spaceflight tracking-network was updated for Gemini . New stations were added at Carnarvon , Australia , and in the Malagasy Republic . The monitoring system for Gemini consists of six consoles , one of which is used to follow the blood pressure , respiration , and pulse rate of each astronaut . This console also has a cardioscope to enable the monitoring physician to watch eight different heartbeat patterns , four for each astronaut . This console also enables the monitoring of cabin pressure and oxygen consumption . As an example of the number of major contractors involved in the design and manufacture of a manned satellite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition , each of these had a number of subcontractors : McDonnell Aircraft Company Prime contractor for the production of the capsules . International Business Machines For the inertial guidance system . Rocketdyne For orbit attitude and maneuvering reaction-control system . Honeywell Inc . For inertial measuring unit . Garrett Corporation-AiResearch For environmental-control systems . General Electric Company For fuel cell system . The Titan launch vehicle underwent an extensive man-rating program to ensure that the structure and the reliability of components were adequate for launching astronauts . The Gemini project is now completed with loo percent success . Particle Radiation-Monitoring Satellite This satellite was launched on August 14 , 1964 , to explore and monitor the inner Van Allen radiation belt . A self-contained propulsion unit was used to inject the satellite into an orbit with an apogee of 2,030 nautical miles and a perigee of 140 nautical miles  | at an inclination of ninety-six degrees . Five experiments were provided to measure proton and electron fluxes , their energies , and angular distributions . Additional experiments were carried to measure the static magnetic field and its pulsations as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of proton energy were discovered in the range of from one to ten kev near the top of the atmosphere . Energetic electrons were also discovered being selectively precipitated at several longitudes in the latitude region near twenty-four degrees to twenty-five degrees . This satellite was also able to monitor the decay of electrons from the high-altitude nuclear explosion of July , 1962 . OSO and AOSO The series of orbiting solar observatories ( OSO ) and advanced orbiting solar observatories ( AOSO ) are instrumented to obtain information on solar radiation and related solar phenomena . Their design circular orbital altitudes are in the range of from 300 to 350 nautical miles . The series of OSO satellites have a gross weight of from 46o to 540 pounds , including experiment weights of from 210 to 230 pounds . The OSO satellites are launched by a Delta vehicle and the AOSO will be launched by a thrust-augmented Thor-Agena . OSO 's have obtained a wealth of information about the sun and the effect of the sun 's radiation on the earth and will obtain more . Spectrometers , spectroheliographs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the many emissions from the sun . Particular attention will be given to the emissions during periods of sun-spot activity , flares , and subflares .

AOSO satellites will have a greater accuracy than OSO satellites . The OSO satellites have from sixteen to eighteen watts of power , and the AOSO will have four hundred watts . Eros , Greb , and TRS These satellites are small spacecraft designed to ride piggyback with other space research and development vehicles . Eros was designed to collect solar energy . Greb was designed to monitor solar  | activity during the International Year of the Quiet Sun by means of photometers . TRS is a series of very small Tetrahedral Research Satellites designed to measure solar radiation . Surveyor The Surveyor series of spacecraft is for the purpose of exploring the lunar surface in preparation for manned lunar landings . Surveyors are designed to make soft landings on the moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the composition of the lunar surface . The first Surveyor was launched on May 30 , 1966 . A successful soft landing was made within ten miles of the midcourse aiming-point after a flight of 63.6 hours . Over ten thousand pictures were obtained before the end of the first period of daylight on the moon on June 14 . The Surveyor vehicle responded properly to approximately i oo , - 000 commands during this period . Between high noon of July 7 ( the second day on the moon ) and July 13 , additional photographs were obtained . At nightfall on July 13 , the battery voltage dropped sharply , and the mission terminated , but a total of 11,150 photographs had been transmitted . The Surveyor spacecraft is a triangle-shaped tubular aluminum structure carrying a variety of specialized electronic and mechanical assemblies . It weighs approximately 2,200 pounds fully fueled . It has a low center of gravity which affords maximum stability during soft lunar landing operations , and three landing legs to cushion and support the craft . Crushable energy-absorbers are located under the space frame . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thermal control methods including superinsulated compartments for critical equipment , special preparation of its external surfaces to achieve optimum solar absorption and thermal emission characteristics , and the use of electrical heaters and thermal conduction paths controlled by bimetallically-operated thermal switches that maintain compartment temperatures within acceptable limits . The folded spacecraft is housed in a conical breakaway shroud atop the Atlas-Centaur launch vehicle . When the vehicle is sixty miles above the earth , the fiberglass nose-shroud which protects the spacecraft during its short journey through the earth 's heavy atmosphere is jettisoned . At approximately one hundred miles the  | spacecraft extends its three landing legs and two omnidirectional antenna booms and transmits a radio signal to permit tracking . After separation three reaction gas jets on the Surveyor 's landing-gear legs control the spacecraft to acquire a fix on , and to track , both the sun and the star Canopus . These reference points are maintained until the scheduled midcourse correction and are reacquired after the maneuver is completed about fifteen hours after launch . The magnitude and direction of the midcourse correction-maneuver and the terminal descent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altered to the desired degree by the action of the three liquid-fueled vernier rocket engines ) are command-controlled from earth by the Deep Space Instrumentation Facility at Goldstone , California . In the first of the seven flights planned , Surveyor I approached the moon at approximately 5,900 miles per hour . At fifty-two miles above the lunar surface , the spacecraft 's altitude-marking radar generated a signal causing ignition of the vernier engines and then of the solid propellant main retro-rocket motor . At 37,000 feet the main retro-engine burned out , and the spherical empty case was ejected from the spacecraft . Surveyor I was then approaching the moon at four hundred miles per hour . Signals from the radar Doppler-velocity sensor , reflected from the surface of the moon , controlled the burning of the three vernier engines to slow the spacecraft until , at an altitude of fourteen feet , the spacecraft was traveling only three and one-half miles per hour . At that point the engines were shut off , and Surveyor I dropped at eight miles per hour to a soft landing on its three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solar cell panel and high-gain antenna were maneuvered to acquire the sun and the earth respectively , and the first television picture , as well as touchdown-engineering data , was transmitted back to the earth via the spacecraft telemetry system . Ranger The Ranger series of spacecraft was designed for close-up photography of the moon . Rangers 7 , 8 and 9 all provided closeups of the moon and impacted very close to their intended targets . This series was brought to a successful conclusion with the impact of  | Ranger 9 within three miles of the selected target on March 24 , 1965 . Photographs of sufficient clarity were obtained to resolve the lunar topological problems for both the manned and unmanned lunar soft-landing vehicles . An earth sensor was used which pointed the directional antenna and locked the Ranger spacecraft in roll . A sun sensor pointed the roll axis and solar panels at the sun and locked the spacecraft in pitch and yaw to achieve three-axis stabilization . A midcourse velocity correction could be made which was capable of reducing the dispersion at the moon from several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spacecraft could be programmed to the proper attitude for firing the retro-rockets which could be triggered with a radar altimeter . Ranger 6 landed within twenty miles of its target ; Ranger 7 within eight miles ; Ranger 8 impacted in Mare Tranquillitatis after photographing a wide swath across the lunar surface ; and Ranger 9 impacted on the floor of the crater Alphonsus within three miles of its target . Apollo This spacecraft is designed to land man on the moon and to provide the means for lunar surface exploration . Before this is attempted a true soft-landing technique must be perfected . A rough landing can be used to land instruments , particularly if the instruments are designed to telemeter data back to the earth and the instruments themselves need not be retrieved . When man lands on the moon a means must be at hand for returning him to earth . For this reason a landing technique which utilizes collapsible or frangible landing-structures in such a way as to prevent the vehicle from being launched again is not permissible . A system that appears feasible is one which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vehicle to be maneuvered into a landing position that is correct for takeoff . Lunar landing flights will be preceded by Earth-orbital and circumlunar flights . A threepart spacecraft will be used for lunar landings . A combined command and control module will provide housing for the three-man crew and instruments and equipment for the functions of command and control . A two-man landing-module will be used for the lunar landings and takeoff . Provision will be made in the landingmodule design to bring back a sizable quantity of lunar material .  | Pioneer The Pioneer series of deep-space probes is an outgrowth of solarpowered Earth satellites . The early instrumentation was designed to obtain particle and field measurements from interplanetary space . A new Pioneer series will support the International Year of the Quiet Sun . Mariner The Mariner series is designed for the purpose of probing deep space . In some respects this series is functionally similar to the Ranger , although it is used for Venusian and Martian probes rather than for lunar probes . These spacecraft are launched with AtlasAgena boosters . Their weight is approximately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take closeups of Mars and Venus and to conduct extensive scientific studies . Mars reaches an optimum position for earth launches about once every twenty-five months . Mariner 4 took 250 days to traverse the distance of approximately sixty-six million miles . Orbiting Astronomical Observatory ( OAO ) The OAO is a large scientific satellite designed to obtain astronomical data outside the earth 's atmosphere . Initial flights will stress obtaining more information about the ultraviolet portion of the spectrum . Spectrophotometry of several thousand stars will be obtained . Tiros The Tiros satellites are part of a meteorological program . They carry television cameras and instruments for infrared observations . The first ten of these spacecraft returned over 600,000 high-quality cloud-cover photographs from the time of the first launch until October , 1966 . Some are still operating . The photographs were taken by the Automatic Picture Transmission ( APT ) camera system in conjunction with forty-seven ground-stations . The satellites weighed about 285 pounds each . Solar cells covered the sides and top with a receiving antenna at the top and four transmitting antennae projecting from the baseplate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five hundred miles . A horizonscanner type of attitude control was carried with despin weights and solid propellant spinup rockets to maintain an optimum spin-  | rate of twelve rpm . The on-board power supply consisted of nickel-chromium batteries charged by the solar cells . Two independent camera systems were used , one with a l o4-degree lens and an APT camera with a io8-degree lens . This system was designed to photograph an area 82o miles on a side with an eighthundred scan-line one-inch vidicon . The photographs were transmitted on the slow-scan principle at four lines per second , which is similar to the principle used for sending radio photographs . Each APT ground station was intended to receive up to three photographs per orbit , or a total of nearly 150 photographs . The other camera used a five-hundred-scan-line one-half-inch vidicon with a tape recorder which could store up to thirty-two photographs for readout to ground stations in Virginia , California , and Alaska . A large number of photographs were received from Tiros VII and VIII which enabled the United States Weather Bureau to spot a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm bulletins . Nimbus Nimbus was an 83o-pound weather research satellite . It operated twenty-four hours a day during its life from August 24 , 1964 , to September 23 , 1964 . This was somewhat short of the six months expected , but even so , more than 27,000 remarkably sharp weather photographs were taken , including some of two hurricanes , from an altitude of 325 miles . Loss of power caused cessation of operation . It is conjectured that the solar paddles became locked , preventing them from rotating to the position necessary to pick up the sun 's energy . Communications Satellites There are two basic types of communications satellites : active and passive . The active communications satellites are repeaters that receive signals , amplify them , and transmit them back to earth where they may be picked up by a station far from the originating station . Active satellites may be real-time repeaters that relay the signals instantaneously , or delayed repeaters that store the signals and relay them at a later predetermined time . Such satellites require a continuous source of on-board electrical power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act as reflectors of radio signals . As such , they do not require on-board power . The principal  | requirement to act as a passive satellite is that the satellite have a large , smooth reflected surface . These are usually balloons that can be expanded at altitude . Their main advantage is high reliability because they have no moving parts and no electronic circuitry . They are also invulnerable to electronic countermeasures . The reflector receives the signal from a directed beam and then reflects it back to earth over a considerable area . High-powered ground transmitters are required for passive communications satellites , but even so , the reflected signal is reduced in strength , and extremely sensitive receivers must be used to pick up the reflected signals . Relay , Telstar and Syneom These satellites are good examples of active communications satellites . The Relay satellites were used primarily for intercontinental microwave communications experiments by NASA-Goddard . In addition , the satellites were equipped to obtain radiation data . The communications experiments were for voice , television , telegraph , data , and telephoto . They weighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including one pressurized and one unpressurized ten-watt traveling wave tube which received on 1725 me and transmitted on 4170 mc . These were capable of television , three hundred one-way voice transmissions , or twelve two-way narrowband transmissions . The system included redundant command receivers , subcarrier demodulators , and telemetry transmitters . Power was supplied by three nickel-cadmium batteries charged by over eight thousand solar cells designed to provide an average of forty-five watts . The spin-stabilization system provided attitude control by means of a sun-aspect sensor , horizon scanner , magnetic torquing coil , and fluid precision damper . The spin-rate was designed for 150 rpm . Thermal control was provided by aluminized Mylar ? shutter vanes . A number of international demonstrations were successfully completed during the Relay flights . Telstar is the experimental communications satellite used by AT and T to determine the feasibility of commercial broadband microwave repeaters . Spacecraft were launched in 1962 and 1963 . The feasibility was proven , and the spacecraft are now silent . The satellite was 341/2 inches in diameter and weighed about 170 pounds . It received communications signals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sent the signals back to another groundstation at a different frequency . It contained 3,600 solar cells which generated fifteen watts of electricity . Over z , 000 transistors and 1,400 diodes were contained in each satellite . It had separate antennae for communications , telemetry , and tracking . The world 's first stationary or synchronous satellite was Syncom III . It was launched from Cape Kennedy on August 19 , 1964 , by a thrust-augmented Delta booster . Its apogee is 22,640 miles ; its perigee , 21,816 miles . Its drift north and south is less than six miles a day . Its rate of revolution is 1436.158 minutes each day compared with the earth 's rate of 1436.068 minutes . It is very nearly a truly synchronous orbit . Television coverage of various events may be relayed and it can also provide a command-control link to trouble spots at various points on the earth . Echo This is a passive type of communications satellite . It was launched in 196o and was the basis for a number of successful communications relays . West Ford In May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , called Project West Ford , was launched in a polar orbit to test its use for narrowband passive orbital communications . Manned Orbiting Laboratory ( MOL ) This is the newest of the military space projects at this writing . It was instituted to obtain new knowledge about what man is able to do in space . It will enable us to relate that ability to the defense of our nation . It will develop technology and equipment which will help advance manned and unmanned space flight . It will also make possible the performance of new and rewarding experiments with the technology and equipment . The Manned Orbiting Laboratory as planned now will be a cylinder between twenty-five and thirty feet long and ten feet in diameter . Orbiting high above the earth it will provide facilities for two men to work for periods of up to thirty days . Unlike preceding space flights , the MOL crewmen will not have to wear cumbersome space-clothing , but they will work in their shirt sleeves .  | Unmanned test flights are planned to start late in 1966 or early in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is scheduled for late in 1968 . The fiscal year 1966 military budget contained $150 million for this project with an estimated total cost of $i.5 billion to find just how useful the military man might be in space . Douglas Aircraft Company has been selected to design and build the spacecraft with the General Electric Company doing the planning and development for the space experiments . It is hoped that this brief resume of selected typical missions will provide the reader with an idea of the tremendous variety of experiments that are performed in space , and some idea of the nature of the results that are obtained .  | THE ENVIRONMMENT OF SPACE GENERAL MAN through the ages has learned to adapt to his environment . The Eskimos in the far north have learned to survive in the bitter cold , snow , and ice . Other people have learned to live in the opposite extreme of temperature ? the heat in and near the deserts of the world . Now man has learned to project himself into space and to survive for a few orbits around the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until it has been proven that man can survive in space for a time long enough to traverse the distance to the moon and return . Following this achievement man will next train for flights to the planets of Venus and Mars and then to places farther out in space . Each flight contributes new information or confirms information already obtained concerning the environment of space . Some of this information contributes to a better understanding of the universe but , some of the new information is needed to better design the space vehicles which will make the next step in space exploration ; first , to enable the vehicles themselves to achieve the performance necessary and to withstand the environment encountered , and then to adequately protect the occupants and add to their comfort . Through spaceflights a considerable amount of information has been gained about the earth itself . Early orbital flights refined our knowledge of the shape of the earth . A satellite 's orbit is affected by the shape or rather by the mass distribution of the earth . From these early orbital measurements it was determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the poles than had been originally assumed . Over thirty years ago radio emissions were discovered from  | outer space . Today thousands of these sources have been identified and located by means of radio interferometry and lunar occultation measurements . Today physicists are investigating x-rays and gamma rays . The status is about that of the investigations of radio emission fifteen years ago . It is believed that x-rays and gamma rays may be linked to the origin of cosmic rays , stellar evolution , and the structure of the universe . No discrete sources have been located for gamma rays . Although x-rays are emitted from the sun 's corona , at least a dozen discrete sources have been found beyond the solar system ; for example , x-radiation is produced by the large region of the Crab Nebula . There are several possible mechanisms that might account for the production of x-rays from a stellar source . First , the source may be the stellar remnant of a supernova explosion which was a powerful emitter of x-rays . This could occur as a result of a catastrophic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could produce a high compression and density and a high temperature . A second possible source of the x-rays could be due to synchrotron radiation produced from the gyration of relativistically charged particles in the magnetic field . A third possibility is that the source of the x-rays is a hot plasma . The high temperature may result from the radioactive debris of the original explosion . A great deal more has been learned about the space environment near the earth than farther away . It is the purpose of this chapter to review what has been learned and the instruments and equipment used to obtain the information . NEAR-EARTH ENVIRONMENT In addition to information concerning the frequency and size of cosmic dust , meteorites and other space debris , a great deal has been learned about the nature of the radiation belts surrounding the earth , the magnetosphere , and the solar wind . Some of the first measurements in space dealt with the radiation zones around the earth . James Alfred Van Allen first detected the inner belt . Protons populate this belt with energies up to several hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cosmic-ray-produced neutrons . It is believed that there may be some particles heavier than protons . The energetic particles have been found as low as 125 miles . The highest flux is at the mag-  | netic equator at an altitude of one-third the earth 's radius for energetic electrons and an altitude of about one-half the earth 's radius for energetic protons . These trapped particles spiral back and forth across the equator between north and south latitude regions . Looking along the direction of the magnetic field , protons spiral in a counter-clockwise direction and electrons in a clockwise direction . Protons drift to the west and electrons to the east at a rotational speed of about one revolution per hour . The Van Allen radiation belts probably had their source in the part of the earth 's magnetosphere that is on the dark side of the earth extending away from the sun . Protons and alpha particles emitted by the sun are shielded from the solar wind in this area . They were affected only by the geomagnetic field and thus were picked up by the magnetic lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed that the trapped particles do interact and mix with the upper atmosphere but in exactly what manner is not known . The laboratories of the State University of Iowa , the University of California at San Diego , the Applied Physics Laboratory of Johns Hopkins University , Bell Telephone Laboratories , Lockheed Missile and Space Company , and the Aerospace Corporation have been predominant in the proton measurements obtained mostly by means of Geiger tubes and scintillators . Explorers IV and XV , Relay 1 , and Telstar i are some of the satellites that have been used . Electron fluxes have also been detected by these same laboratories and in addition by the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory . Most of the electron-flux measurements have been made since July , 1962 , when a nuclear explosion was set off at high altitude to determine the effect on the atmosphere . Before that date , electron fluxes were not very well known . The electron population is still dominated by the particles artificially injected into the atmosphere by the explosion . The effect of nuclear explosions on the natural radiation belt has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect will persist for as long as thirty years . Several satellites have been damaged by this artificial radiation belt . Another satellite was not damaged immediately but was affected later .  | There is also an outer radiation belt populated by protons and electrons with energies up to several MEV for the electrons and tens or even hundreds of MEV for the protons . The fluxes vary with time , although the proton fluxes are considerably more stable than the electron fluxes . In general the size and shape change with changes in magnetic activity and with the variation in the outflow of ionized plasma from the sun called the solar wind . This plasma carries the high-energy protons that are produced in connection with solar flares . The velocity of the solar wind away from the sun varies from 600,000 miles per hour in quiet times to as high as three times this during periods of severe solar flare activity . The earth 's magnetic field is affected by the solar wind as illustrated in Figure q .. It is quite likely that the field would extend from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not for the solar wind . A shock wave is set up as the wind encounters the magnetic field around the earth . This shock wave is similar to an aerodynamic sonic shock wave . The particles of the solar wind travel faster than the weak magnetohydrodynamic waves and from that standpoint are supersonic . There is a turbulent area between the outer boundary of the magnetosphere and the shock wave . In this region the magnetoenergy density and the particle energy density are about the same . Figure 4 shows how the magnetosphere is pulled out downwind of the earth . The distance is about thirty-two earth radii . It extends upwind of the earth about ten earth radii . The stagnation point for the shock wave is about thirteen earth radii upwind of the earth . From measurements made over the last one hundred years it has been determined that the intensity of the earth 's magnetic field is decreasing . If the intensity continues to decrease at the present rate , it will reach zero about two thousand years from now and after that time , reverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or no magnetic field , the earth will no longer be shielded from cosmic rays . From studies of rock from the ocean floor and a determination of the direction in which rock particles have hardened , it is believed that the earth 's magnetic field has reversed in direction many times in the past . Although the increased cosmic-ray bombardment undoubtedly has an effect on simple animal life , it is not known what the effect will be on man . Some species of simple life may be killed , and others may be mutated.  | LUNAR ENVIRONMENT The pictures taken during the Ranger 7 flight added tremendously to the store of knowledge about the moon 's physical characteristics . These pictures were taken from nine hundred miles away to as close as one thousand feet before impact . There are still some differences of opinion regarding the detailed nature of the lunar surface , although most experts agree upon the density of the atmosphere or rather , the lack of it . The results of soft instrumented landings by Surveyor spacecraft will clarify the bearingstrength of the surface or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Russian spacecraft , Luna 9 , measured a twenty-four-hour radiation dose of thirty millirads . PLANETARY AND INTERPLANETARY ENVIRONMENT A considerable amount of information was learned about the nature of the space environment near Mars as a result of the Mariner 4 mission , in addition to adding considerably to our store of knowledge about the near-earth space environment . This mission was an outstanding success . Not only were the propulsion , guidance , and tracking such that the payload was placed at the designated place in space at the correct time , but the scientific information was relayed successfully back through space to earth stations . A number of photographs were obtained of the surface of Mars . These show quite clearly that craters of a size and number comparable to those on the moon are present . The rims rise a few hundred feet above the surrounding surface , and the bottoms are a few thousand feet below the rims . Indications are that the surface is ancient . Its state of preservation indicates that there have been no atmosphere and no water , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no significant magnetic field . In addition to the television equipment , other scientific equipment was carried : a cosmic-ray telescope , cosmic-dust detector , trapped-radiation detectors , an ionization chamber , a plasma probe , and a magnetometer . Difficulty was encountered with the plasma probe and the ionization chamber , but all other equipment worked well , and a large amount of scientific data was obtained . The pressure at the surface of Mars was determined to be much lower than  | previously thought , as low as five to seven millibars . The intensity of the magnetic field is only about 1/3000 that of the earth . INSTRUMENTS AND EQUIPMENT USED TO EXPLORE SPACE In this section it is intended to present an idea of the variety of instruments and the nature of the equipment that is used to explore space and some idea of the principles upon which they operate . The method in obtaining space environmental information is to do it in the simplest manner possible ; therefore simple instrumentation for experiments is desirable . Consideration must be given to the following in selecting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weight . 2 . A minimum of moving parts . 3 . Minimum power consumption . 4 . Ability to withstand launch accelerations ? must be rugged yet light . 5 . Ability to operate at the temperature and pressure of space . 6 . Ability to store and handle the data acquired . 7 . An adequate number of communications channels . The functions of instruments and equipment necessary for space exploration may be placed in the following categories : 1 . Measurement of the various aspects of the performance of the spacecraft . 2 . Monitoring of the physiological condition of the occupants of the spacecraft . 3 . Obtainment of scientific information about the environment of space . 4 . Transmission of the above information to earth stations . It must be remembered when reading the following information on instruments and equipment that only the instruments necessary for the requirements of a specific mission are carried . The weight allowance for instruments and equipment is limited , and only those items are carried that are absolutely essential . No attempt will be made to explain the detailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the subject of a separate book .  | Instruments and Equipment Used to Measure the Performance of the Spacecraft The most important factors that must be known for the spacecraft itself are its exact position in space , the direction of its motion , and its velocity . This information is learned by means of a tracking system . A system based on radar , radio , optical or infrared principles may be used . The position of the spacecraft in space can be obtained from a system that gives the range of the spacecraft from three well-spaced ground-stations . The range obtained from each of the stations represents the radius of a hemisphere on which the spacecraft is located . The common point of intersection of the three hemispheres represents the position of the spacecraft . The position of the spacecraft can also be determined by measuring the angle to the spacecraft from two stations , or the position can be determined with a single special radar that determines both the direction and the distance to the spacecraft . The direction of motion of the spacecraft is obtained by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is obtained simply by dividing the distance that it has traveled by the time it has taken . From the readings obtained , adjustments can be made to the direction of thrust and its duration to provide the necessary guidance for the mission . Instruments and Equipment Used to Monitor the Physiological Condition of Spacecraft Occupants In order for the physiological condition of the spacecraft occupants to be at an optimum , the spacecraft 's cabin must be kept at comfortable levels of temperature , pressure , and humidity . Instruments and equipment used to measure , record , and transmit this information are necessary . A check must also be kept of the carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide content in the cabin 's atmosphere . In addition to this a continuous check must be kept of the respiration rate , temperature , and blood pressure of the occupants . Instruments and Equipment Used to Obtain Scientific Information About the Environment of Space Inasmuch as most space missions are designed for the purpose of obtaining additional or confirmatory scientific information , the following discussion of scientific instruments and equipment is  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limitations all instruments are not carried on any one flight , only those necessary for the mission . A valuable astronomical satellite instrument for future observations will be telescopes as large as thirty-six inches in diameter , but they are heavy and it will be some time before they are in common use . One of the simplest types of observation is by means of filter photometry . Stellar energies can be detected and measured in a specific wavelength interval defined by the band-pass of a filter or by the spectral characteristics of the detector . A typical photometer is one that uses a quartz lens as the objective . At the focal plane a field-stop limits the field of view to a small square of the sky , perhaps four degrees on a side . All of the light coming through the square passes through a filter and is focused on a photomultiplier . From an amplifier a signal is sent to the transmitter where it is relayed to the ground and recorded . For short wavelengths , an ion chamber may be placed at the focus of a reflecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premium the chamber may be mounted directly on the spacecraft 's skin with a honeycomb structure in front of it to define the field of view . Control systems have been developed that make it possible to point the spacecraft in a particular direction with respect to a selected star . This makes it possible to study individual stars in greater detail . Other typical instruments are discussed below according to their purpose . Temperature Measurement A common device for measuring temperature is a thermistor . This is simply an electrical resistor . A material is selected whose resistance varies considerably with temperature . The gauge which measures this resistance is calibrated to read temperature instead . Thermocouples are also common for measuring temperature . These are constructed by joining two dissimilar metals which produce an output voltage proportional to the junction temperature . Wide ranges can be measured by the proper selection of the junction metals . A common type of thermocouple is constructed with  | bismuth for one metal and a combination of bismuth and 5 percent tin for the other . Pressure Measurement Pressure gauges are of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wire resistance-filament being cooled by a gas , the amount of cooling and thus the amount of decrease of the resistance being a measure of the pressure . These are called Pirani gauges . The second type of pressure gauge works on the principle of ionizing the gas and then measuring the ionization . There are three common methods of ionizing the gas : one method causes the ionization by electrons emitted from a cold cathode gauge ; another method causes the ionization by electrons emitted from a hot filament ; in the third type the ionization is caused by particles emitted from a radioactive emitter . Particle Radiation Measurement Solar particles can be measured with an electrostatic analyzer , the x-ray spectrometer , the proton ionization gauge , or the ion scintillation spectrometer . Electrostatic analyzers measure the charge and energy of low-energy solar particles . Such an analyzer is constructed so that the charged particles which enter the analyzer are deflected by an electric field transverse to the direction of particle motion . The particles which have the proper charge sign , energy , and angles are deflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particles are measured with the cosmic-ray telescope , the Cerenkov telescope , the Geiger-Muller tube , the integrating ionization chamber , or nuclear emulsions . The nuclear emulsion is the simplest : a cosmic ray passing through this leaves a track which can be analyzed and the nature of the particle determined . The basic element of a cosmic-ray telescope is a metal tube filled with an argon-methane mixture . The metal thickness of the tube is carefully selected so as to give the optimum bound to the particles which are to be counted . The pulses produced by the particles are then amplified and counted . A Geiger-Muller tube is constructed so that the wall of the tube forms a cathode with a wire through the center forming the  | anode . The tube is filled with a mixture of an inert gas such as argon and a small amount of a gas such as methane or alcohol . A voltage applied to the anode produces an electric field in the tube . It is constructed so that the field is strongest around the anode . When an ionizing particle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . The intermittent current and voltage pulse produced by different particles can be counted . The integrating ionization chamber is another scheme for measuring cosmic-ray particle radiation . This chamber measures the total ionization produced in a set time in the volume of gas contained in the chamber . Argon is the gas which is used . An ion collector is mounted in the chamber with a quartz fiber mounted near the base in such a way that it will touch the collector when voltage is applied and the fiber bends . As it touches the collector it becomes charged , and the fiber returns to its original position . The electric field which is produced between the collector and the outer wall is sufficient to collect the ions which are formed . The ionization current discharges the collector until it is recharged by the quartz fiber touching it . The pulses generated in any given time can be counted and the number of particles determined from the known characteristics of the collector . The minimum particle energy that can be measured is a function of the thickness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the common features of low weight , low power required , and reproducible results over a long period of time . Photodetectors of different types are also available for measuring particle radiation . One type uses photoconductive cadmium sulphide crystals . The electrical conductivity of these crystals is proportional to the rate of deposit of energy of ionization . To operate such a detector , a constant voltage is impressed across the crystal , and the current produced is then used to charge a capacitor . A neon bulb is placed in the circuit . When the voltage across the capacitor reaches the firing potential of the neon bulb , the bulb fires , thus discharging the capacitor . The cycle is then repeated and the pulse-rate measured . There are several different forms of detector which use the principle of the Cerenkov effect , one of which is the Cerenkov tele-  | scope . The principle is that charged particles which pass through an optically transparent medium at a speed greater than the speed of light cause the medium to emit light . A simple form of detector involves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The total amount of light emitted is proportional to the energy of the charged particles being measured . Electromagnetic Radiation Measurement Several different instruments are available for this type of measurement : an albedo meter , a neutron proportional counter , and an omnidirectional radiometer . Both the albedo meter and the omnidirectional radiometer work on the principle that as radiation is absorbed the resistance changes . Electric-Field Measurement The electric-field meter , an ion probe , or a Langmuir probe may be used to measure electric fields . The electric-field meter measures the field strength at the surface of the spacecraft . The ion probe measures the ion temperature and concentration ; it is used for high densities . The Langmuir probe measures the electron temperature and the spacecraft potential . Magnetic-Field Measurement A magnetometer is commonly used to measure magnetic fields . Various types are available ; one type is a flux-gate magnetometer . With it a current is produced that is proportional to the magnetic field . This is done by using a core of highly permeable material that is excited by a sinusoidal audiofrequency signal that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The protonprecision magnetometer is used for a low range . It has an output frequency that is proportional to the magnitude of the magnetic field . This is obtained by taking advantage of the fact that the nucleus of the hydrogen atom , the proton , has a magnetic moment and a spin angular momentum . When the spinning proton is acted upon by the torque produced by the interaction of its magnetic moment and the ambient magnetic field , precession occurs about the direction of the magnetic field and at an angular rate that is determined by its magnetic moment and spin . With the rotatingcoil magnetometer , a sinusoidal current is produced that is proportional to the magnetic-field component that is perpendicular to  | the spin axis . The rubidium-vapor magnetometer works on the principle that its frequency is proportional to the magnitude of the magnetic field . Monochromatic light is generated in the rubidium-vapor lamp by placing it in the output circuit of an oscillator . The rubidium vapor is excited by the oscillator . The resulting light is then filtered , polarized , and focused on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which precesses about the externally applied magnetic field . A variation in the intensity of the light received by the photocell is caused by the precession . This frequency can be measured and thus the magnetic field in the vicinity of the spacecraft is measured . Micrometeoric Particle Measurement Four different types of instruments are available to measure micrometeoric particles . An erosion gauge may be used to measure the increase in resistance of a surface as it is eroded by the micrometeorites . A light-flash detector may be used to measure the light-energy released as a micrometeorite impacts on the spacecraft . A microphone may be used to record the momenta of the impinging particles . A resistance grid may be used to measure the penetrating ability of the larger particles . The grid is composed of fine wires which break upon impact . Instruments and Equipment Used to Transmit Scientific Data to Earth Stations The instruments and equipment mentioned above are capable of collecting and measuring a wealth of scientific data . To make this data useful it must be transmitted to earth stations where it may be collated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmission . Such a system must be capable of transmitting simultaneously many different types of information . This is usually done with transducers which provide an electrical analogue-output proportional to the quantity being measured . This information may be transmitted to earth by any one of several different methods such as amplitude modulation , frequency modulation , or pulsecode modulation . For certain types of missions ( for example , lunar , Venusian , and Martian exploratory flights ) in which surface photographic detail is desired , cameras are carried in order to relay back to earth  | as much information as possible . Spectrophotometry can be used to obtain the nature of planetary atmospheres and planetary surface features such as greater detail of the polar caps of Mars . Visual and photographic polarimeters can be used to detect polarization in extremely small areas or images that are faint . Very low-weight spectrometers ( as low as six pounds ) are now available for space exploration .  | THE PERFORMANCE OF SPACECRAFT PRIOR to discussing the performance of spacecraft , it is well to define exactly that part of a space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of a complete space vehicle that is designed to accomplish a special mission in space . There are as many different designs of spacecraft as there are missions , and each mission requires a slightly different performance . The spacecraft carries all of the instruments and equipment required to obtain the scientific information desired and also houses man , if man is necessary for the mission . Performance for a spacecraft means the ability to reach some predetermined position in space in order to make certain observations or accomplish certain studies . This position is usually achieved by imparting a certain velocity and direction to the spacecraft by the launch-vehicle part of the complete space vehicle . The primary propulsion and guidance capability is housed in the launch vehicle , although midcourse and terminal guidance are housed in the spacecraft as are the maneuvering and retro-propulsion . There are several differences between the performance of spacecraft and the performance of ground vehicles and air vehicles . For each type of vehicle , attainable velocity is an important item of performance . Ground and air vehicles are designed to traverse distances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of ground or air vehicle is designed with a maximum attainable velocity , but in operation the maximum velocity is seldom used , certainly not continuously . In fact , in traversing considerable distances , automobiles , trucks , buses , trains , and aircraft make numerous stops . The number of stops and the duration of the stops have a considerable effect upon the length of the complete trip . In contrast , a  | space vehicle must attain a certain minimum velocity necessary to accomplish the mission and must reach this velocity in a very short time . This velocity represents energy that can be converted into distance that the spacecraft can be propelled directly away from earth or the height of an orbit above the earth . One might use the analogy of throwing a baseball into the air to illustrate part of this ? the part in which a spacecraft is propelled directly away from earth . The greater the force that is imparted to the baseball by the thrower 's arm , the higher the baseball will go . To reach a certain height requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires a certain force , and the same is true for space missions . At the present time spacecraft are not able to stop while enroute to their destination as ground and air vehicles can , although at some future time they may be able to perform a routine rendezvous with an earth-orbital station for refueling before continuing the trip into space . Gemini spacecraft in 1965 and 1966 successfully performed experimental rendezvous missions . The range of velocity-capability for ground and air vehicles is such that they may be called upon to perform many different missions within the ground and air range with the same basic configuration . The velocity required and the fuel consumption to attain this velocity may be fairly continuous over a considerable portion of the mission . In contrast , space missions require the attainment of high velocities , very early in the mission with little or no change in velocity during the mission accomplished with on-board power . There is , of course , some change in velocity due to variation in gravitational attraction during the mission or due to short applications of power used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retro-power may be applied to accomplish a landing . Figure 5 will illustrate the effect of variation of the initial injection direction on the orbit established . It is assumed that injection into an earth orbit is to be made at point 0 and that the velocity and direction OA is the velocity and direction necessary to establish a circular orbit . If , at point 0 , the velocity is the same as that required for OA , but the direction of injection is OB or ( ) C , elliptical orbits will be established as shown instead of a circular orbit .  | Figure 5 . Effect of Initial Injection Direction on Established Earth Orbit . Figure 6 illustrates the effect of a variation in the initial injection velocity but with the direction remaining the same in each instance . Let us first consider OA , the same velocity and direction that was necessary to establish the circular orbit in Figure 5 . Then , if the injection direction is kept the same but the injection velocity is decreased , an elliptical orbit will be described as shown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OA but still in the same direction , the elliptical orbit OC will result . If the injection velocity is increased to a still higher value but in the same direction , a parabolic escape path , OD , will be described . OE is a hyperbolic escape path at a still higher velocity but where injection still takes place at point 0 in the same direction . The velocity that will achieve escape from the earth 's gravitational field is slightly over 37,000 feet per second . Figure 7 explains the different techniques by which one might travel from earth to point 0 of Figures 5 and 6 . Part ( a ) of Figure 7 illustrates the simplest technique but one that is used only for  | low-altitude orbits . The technique consists of applying continuous power from the launch to injection into orbit . Burnout is timed to occur at point 0 at the correct velocity and pointed in the correct direction . The launch vehicle and payload , then both go into orbit at point 0 . Part ( b ) of Figure 7 illustrates the technique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a ) . This technique involves a coast to a higher altitude from the burnout altitude , then injection into orbit at this altitude . The technique illustrated in part ( c ) is one that is used for very high orbits . The initial launch and coast periods are similar to that of part ( b ) , but the injection at the end of this initial coast period is at the perigee of an inter-  | mediate elliptical orbit . After a coast up to the apogee of this orbit , a second injection places the spacecraft into the final orbit . This technique can be used for the very high altitudes necessary for the stationary or twenty-four-hour synchronous orbits . MISSION TECHNIQUES At this point it is appropriate also to illustrate the techniques which may be used for a rendezvous with a vehicle orbiting the earth , the techniques used for achieving various lunar missions , and the techniques used for solar planetary missions such as those to Mars and Venus . Rendezvous There are two different basic techniques that can be used for a rendezvous mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the target vehicle which is already in orbit . This requires timing of the launch to a matter of minutes and then careful adjustment of the final velocity of the chase vehicle to that of the target vehicle . If a hold of appreciable length is encountered in the countdown an attempt can not be made until the next orbit . The launch-timing for the chase vehicle is not critical for the second case ; it can be launched into the orbital plane of the target without regard to the position of the target . The chaser can be at either a higher or lower altitude than the target ; the orbital periods of the two are thus different . Their periods and positions can be made to coincide when their relative positions are appropriate . The chaser can be decelerated with retro-rockets if it is above and ahead of the target or accelerated if it is below and behind the target . This technique avoids the precise launch-timing that is necessary with the other method but substitutes a precise timing to initiate the corrective firing of the vehicle in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trajectory for a circumlunar mission . Due to the fact that one is not trying to impact on the moon , small errors in velocity and direction are allowable . However , the launch velocity must be accurate to within hundreds of feet per second , and the direction must be accurate to within one degree in order to avoid excessive corrections . An uncorrected velocity error at the earth of ten feet per second results in an error of one thousand  | miles at the distance of the moon . The time of launch must be quite carefully selected . There is one day each month that may be selected for launch so that the distance to be traversed is at a minimum , and only a few minutes of that day are most advantageous . For a circumlunar mission , the launch velocity can be only slightly above that necessary to get that far from earth . As the spacecraft enters the moon 's gravitational field it will be deflected from its path enough to circumnavigate the moon and return to the vicinity of the earth . This requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too high the spacecraft could go past the moon , only slightly deflected , and continue into space . Only a slight change in this trajectory is necessary to impact on the moon . If a soft landing is desired it is well not to allow the approach velocity to become too high as it must be reduced to zero by retro-rockets in order to achieve the ideal soft landing . In order to achieve a lunar orbit a trajectory must be planned that misses the moon by a distance equal to the altitude of the desired orbit . At this point the velocity of the spacecraft will be in the vicinity of 8,000 feet per second . This velocity must be reduced to around 5,500 feet per second ? the circular orbital velocity near the moon 's surface . This is done by means of retro-rockets . The circular lunar orbit may be utilized for close reconnaissance of the lunar surface . Later , such an orbit may be used in connection with manned ex- Figure 8 .

The three-man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to descend to the moon 's surface from a lunar-orbiting vehicle with which they must rendezvous at the conclusion of the lunar exploration . Venusian Mission Techniques Proper timing is one of the main problems in planning an exploratory mission to Venus . Both Venus and earth describe very nearly circular orbits and are almost in the same plane , so the problem of transferring from one orbit to the other is not a difficult one . The timing problem is one of determining when Venus and earth are in the correct relative positions so that a spacecraft launched from earth will reach Venus with the least distance traversed . This optimum time occurs approximately every nineteen months . The next suitable period will be June 7-21 , 1967 . Martian Mission Techniques The orbit of Mars about the sun is considerably more eccentric than that of either Earth or Venus . The optimum time to launch a spacecraft from Earth to Mars occurs approximately every twenty-five months . The next suitable period is early in 1969 , and the next suitable period following that will occur in 1971 , twentyfive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the opposition of Mars which happens when Earth passes between Mars and the sun . Of course , due to the eccentricity of the Martian orbit , the minimum distance between Mars and Earth varies from approximately thirty-four million miles to as much as sixty-four million miles during an unfavorable opposition . During some exploratory flights it might be desirable to visit Mars with a swingby to Venus on the return to Earth . One advantage of such a procedure is a considerable reduction in the earth-entry velocity compared with the velocity of a direct Earth entry from Mars . A reduction from 65,000 feet per second to 44,000 feet per second could result . Figure 9 illustrates the steps in such a mission . First is a transfer orbit to the plane of Mars and then an actual landing on Mars with a very short stay . Upon departure from Mars a transfer to the orbital plane of Venus is made , but there is no landing on Venus . A swingby through the gravitational field of Venus is used to alter the velocity and direc-  | tion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major item of spacecraft performance is the tremendous velocity necessary to accomplish the various missions in space . A large quantity of fuel must be carried to attain this velocity . This makes the ratio of the total weight of the space vehicle at launch to the weight of the spacecraft quite high . The fuel tanks and engines used for the initial launch are usually separated and dropped after the correct velocity has been imparted to the spacecraft . This is done so that energy does not have to be applied to dead weight which is no longer useful . A lot of thought has been devoted to the design of reusable boosters for space vehicles , but to date this effort has not extended beyond the study-stage . In order to achieve the high velocity required for space flight , which represents a considerable amount of energy , careful attention must be paid to weight . Each pound of weight in the final  | stage must be accelerated to the velocity required . Therefore , it is necessary to reduce every item of equipment and instrumentation to the absolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guidance and control equipment needed to achieve and maintain the proper attitude of the vehicle . There are many contrasts between ground , air , and space vehicle performance . Ground vehicles , operating on the surface of the earth , require the ability to change direction in only two dimensions , whereas both air and space vehicles must make a threedimensional change . The three-dimensional changes required of a space vehicle are much more complex than those required of an air vehicle because accurate trajectories and orbits must be maintained over great distances and long periods of time . Aerodynamic controls are used for aircraft ( rudder , elevator , and ailerons ) ; missiles and space vehicles are controlled by regulating the direction in which the thrust is applied . Communication must be maintained during the entire flight . Fuel consumption is important in all three types of vehicles but is perhaps most important in space vehicles because weight and volume are so critical . It is expensive to obtain high-energy fuels for space propulsion , so fuel consumption also affects cost . The following types of space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space vehicles : Type I : Space probes These probes are designed to get outside the earth 's atmosphere but to return to Earth . A high ballistic trajectory is executed . Type II : Earth-orbital missions For these missions a sufficiently high velocity is imparted to the spacecraft so that the gravitational force is balanced by the centrifugal force , and the spacecraft continues to circle the earth . If the circular altitude is low enough so that the spacecraft encounters the atmosphere , or if the atmosphere is encountered during part of an elliptical orbit , air resistance will cause the spacecraft to eventually return to Earth . Even though the orbit may not encounter the atmosphere at all , the spacecraft may be returned to Earth by decelerating it with retro-rockets . Type III : Lunar probes A higher level of energy is necessary for either a lunar impact or circumlunar mission than for an Earth-orbital mission .  | Type IV : Planetary probes To get to either Mars or Venus requires a substantial increase in energy over that required to get to the vicinity of the moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solar planets requires an even greater increase in energy . Type VI : Stellar probes To travel beyond our solar system requires still another increase in energy . Table VII compares the various energies ( indicated by Velocity ) required by the above six types of space missions . A the bottom of Table VII are listed the velocities of several types of vehicles with which we are more familiar than space vehicles . It should be noted , by way of comparison , that a high-speed rifle bullet fired after a ballistic missile or space vehicle has reached its top velocity could not catch up . Think of the difference in force required to propel a bullet , which weights only a few grams , to 3,000 feet per second and that required to propel a spacecraft , which weighs several thousand pounds , to 37,200 feet per second . This force must be applied over a length of time sufficient to permit the accelerating spacecraft to reach the required velocity . Starting at zero velocity as the space vehicle sits on the launch pad , it gradually picks up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached . Therefore , the first consideration in the design of a space vehicle is the means of primary propulsion to be used . A propellant and a propulsive device which fulfill the performance requirements at low cost , are of high reliability , and weigh as little as possible must be used . The specific density of the fuel is important from the standpoint of weight , and the fuel consumption is important from the standpoint of both weight and cost . The guidance and control system must insure that the vehicle be directed on the proper trajectory as it is launched , that staging be properly timed , and that fuel cutoff be accomplished when the desired velocity is reached . In Table VII velocity is the only item of performance listed . It is a measure of the energy required and can be used for a direct comparison . The kinetic energy involved is % MV2 , so if we talk about the same mass in all instances , a rough comparison of the figure energies required can be made by comparing the velocities required for different destinations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VII as straight up and return . What is usually required on a probe of this type is information about the lower fringes of space and possibly data regarding reentry into the atmosphere of the earth . Obviously , we do not want the probe to return exactly to the starting point and destroy the launch pad .  | Usually , a short ballistic range is planned of a few hundred miles downrange . Ballistic missiles are listed under Space probes as intermediate range and intercontinental range ballistic missiles do enter space at the top of their trajectories . During research and development testing , space experiments are sometimes carried on ballistic missile flights in lieu of the warhead which would be carried on operational missions . It can be seen from Earth-orbital missions that as a vehicle orbits the earth at greater and greater altitudes , more and more velocity or energy is required . The velocity required for even the most modest of space missions is tremendous when compared with the velocities of air and ground vehicles . To produce the centrifugal force necessary to balance the earth 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25,900 feet per second even if the effect of the atmosphere is neglected . To overcome the resistance of the atmosphere for such a low-altitude satellite would require a continuously applied force above that necessary for 25,900 feet per second . Most circular earth satellites are established at high enough altitudes so that atmospheric resistance is not a factor . The added velocity required to establish an orbit at a high altitude is not great . A three **27;69;TOOLONG orbit , for example , requires about 26,000 feet per second and a one **27;98;TOOLONG orbit only 27,000 feet per second . To achieve a **26;127;TOOLONG orbit requires 33,800 feet per second . At that altitude the velocity required to maintain a constant altitude is the same as the rotational velocity of the earth . The satellite will then maintain a set position above the earth 's surface in what is sometimes called a stationary or synchronous orbit . To reach the vicinity of the moon by lunar probes requires about the same velocity ( 36,000 feet per second ) or energy regardless of whether an impact on the lunar surface or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gravitational attraction requires a minimum of 36,700 feet per second , but a slightly greater velocity than this will be provided if escape is desired . A space flight to the vicinity of the moon is still within the field of the earth 's gravitational attraction as is the moon . Planetary probes to Venus and Mars are listed under Type IV as requiring the same velocity ( 37,200 feet per second ) even  | though the distances to them are different . This is because Venus is inside the earth 's orbit around the sun , and Mars is outside . Not all the remaining planets are listed under Deep space probes , but enough are listed to give a good idea of the amount of energy required . The large planet Saturn , with a heavy atmosphere , lies between Jupiter and Uranus and is very cold ? not very inviting . Neptune , which is not listed either , lies between Pluto and Uranus and is believed to be gaseous . The time required for round-trip flights from the earth to the other solar planets is shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy and do not include the holding time on the planet , holding time being the delay encountered while waiting for the most favorable time for the return launch . figure Last we come to Stellar probes . Only a few stars are listed to give an idea of the energy and time required . Distances to the stars are given in light-years rather than nautical or statute miles . The distance to our nearest star , Alpha Centauri , is 4.3 light-years . This is the distance that light travels in 4.3 years . The four stars listed ? Alpha Centauri , Barnard 's Star , Sirius , and Altair ? could all be reached with velocities ranging from 6o,000 to 75,000 feet per second . The extremely long time required to traverse these distances at these velocities can easily be calculated from the fact that it takes light , traveling at a velocity of 186,300 miles per second , 4.3 years to reach earth from Alpha Centauri and 16.5 years to reach earth from Altair , and these are close stars . To reach the fardistant Andromeda Nebula it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of light . As it will be many years before we have space vehicles capable of even approaching the speed of light , it can  | be realized that it will also be many years before much exploring is done by spacecraft outside the solar system . Although it will be some time before space vehicles are able to attain velocities approaching the speed of light , the time required to reach distant places in space can be reduced by increasing the space vehicle velocity above that required for minimum energy . The minimum velocity is the least that can be used and still reach the destination . Any lower velocity will fall short of the destination , but an increase in velocity will reduce the time required to get there . Venus can be used as a destination to illustrate the reduction in time that can result from using an excess velocity over the minimum required . With minimum velocity of 37,200 feet per second , 4.82 months are required to reach Venus . This time can be reduced to less than three months by increasing the velocity to 40,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still further by an additional increase in the velocity . From the discussion thus far it might appear , from the fact that velocity is of such great importance to performance , that propulsive thrust is the only concern . It is true that propulsion is of paramount importance in achieving the velocity required for the specific mission , but there are many other factors that contribute to the performance of a spacecraft , and many of these factors interact with each other . A brief mention of some of them will be made here , with more detail in Chapter IX on how they affect the design of a spacecraft . Let us consider the propulsion system first and study some of the factors that enter into the design of it , thereby affecting the performance . The weight of the entire vehicle that must be propelled to the required velocity is important ; therefore , every factor affecting the weight of the propulsion system must be considered . The weight of the propellant tanks is one major factor in the weight of the propulsion system . Some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the amount of propellant required as well as the shape of the tanks are major factors in the weight of the propellant tanks . If the tanks are cylindrical , the slenderness ratio has an effect on their weight . The type of construction and the material used are important factors . If the tanks arc of thin skin and require pressurization for stability when not  | completely filled , the weight of the pressurization system must be considered . This may depend upon the pressurization level and the total volume to be pressurized . If pressurization is not needed for stability , then the type of construction must be such as to afford adequate support when the tanks are empty . The loads and temperatures to which the tanks are subjected have an effect upon their weight , that is , the loads experienced in flight : thrust , acceleration , vibration , drag , and bending moments ; as well as the loads experienced on the launch pad : dead weight and bending due to wind . A change in any one of these items may change several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in the design of many other systems and subsystems ? the guidance and control system , for example . Here , some of the factors that enter into the basic equations of motion are involved in the basic formula for velocity . Multistage vehicles further complicate the interactions . As an illustration of the interactions involved in the performance of a spacecraft , let us consider the shape of the launch vehicle . Its shape has an effect upon the drag experienced by the vehicle . The drag has an effect upon the trajectory and the aerodynamic heating . The shape of the vehicle , the heating , and the tank pressure required have an effect upon the tank wall thickness and thus upon the weight of the structure . The change in weight can affect the aerodynamic heating again which , together with the pressure program and the allowable stress of the material , can affect the trajectory . In order to obtain all of the iterative effects and to optimize the effect of all the changes and thus arrive at an optimum performance it is necessary to program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their effects upon each other and obtain the solution from a digital computer .  | DESIGN OF MANNED SPACECRAFT As was indicated in the preceding chapter , performance and design are intimately related . The major design factors that contribute to the performance of manned space vehicles and the success of a mission are as follow : 1 . The size of the payload ( weight and volume ) required to accomplish the desired mission . 2 . The specific impulse and thrust necessary to boost the payload to the required velocity . 3 . The guidance equipment necessary to put the spacecraft in the correct orbit or trajectory . 4 . The scientific equipment and instruments utilized to carry out the experiments and to signal that the spacecraft is operating satisfactorily . 5 . Provisions for the sustenance , comfort , and safety of the occupants . 6 . Adequate provision for safe and accurate reentry into the earth 's atmosphere . To achieve the desired performance of a spacecraft requires very careful attention to the design details of the boosting vehicle . Many of the design factors for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion . The effects of changes in one design factor can best be determined from a generalized analysis performed by a high-speed digital computer . This analysis takes into account the many interrelated factors and the effects that they have on each other . However , after a detailed design is completed and production has started , it frequently happens that some design features have to be changed from the optimum as determined by the generalized analysis . Weight is a factor that is particularly difficult to regulate , and it must be controlled rigidly as over-  | weight adversely affects performance . Booster items that affect weight , such as tank pressurization , pressure bottle weight , tank skin thickness , and material density are included in the generalized design analysis program , but such items as the weight of the brackets used to support instruments and equipment are difficult to estimate accurately , and the weight of instruments and equipment is hard to determine while these items are being designed . The weight of the supporting structure for major components such as the electrical power source , primary propulsion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to include accurately in the generalized analysis . The chief designer of the spacecraft is faced with a wide range of design conditions . For some portions of a space mission , the g-loadings may be quite high ( during acceleration from the launch pad and deceleration upon reentry ) and at other times the g-loading is zero . Structural design conditions are based upon the most severe combination of loading and heating that exists throughout the mission . The zero-g condition may be critical for the operation of some items of equipment . All hydraulic equipment , for example , must function under zero-g as well as high-g conditions . The designer of every part of a spacecraft must also be extremely weight-conscious in order to keep the overall weight from growing beyond bounds . Other books have described in detail the design requirements for a space launch vehicle , covering the engines , tankage , fuel system , guidance , and control . This chapter will concentrate mainly on the design of the spacecraft part of the space vehicle . The principal items to be discussed are the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this shape has on the performance and operation of the spacecraft . 2 . The structure to withstand launching , flight , and landing loads . 3 . Heat-protection methods and materials . 4 . Physiological problems . S. Propulsion and attitude control . 6 . Secondary power supply . 7 . Communications . 8 . Instruments and equipment . 9 . Landing and recovery . It is not intended to discuss these topics from the standpoint of how to design a spacecraft while taking these items into account  | but from the standpoint of factors that must be considered in the design of a spacecraft . SPACECRAFT SHAPE The final configuration of the spacecraft will be the best compromise between weight , volume , and cost that will perform the mission and provide the occupants with adequate protection and comfort for the duration of the mission . The spacecraft structure must have a sufficiently large volume to house all of the instruments , equipment , passengers , food , water , and supplies for the mission . The exterior shape of the structure is predicated largely upon the requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orbit the earth and return to earth or to circumnavigate the moon or a planet and return to earth , only earth reentry conditions need be considered . If , however , the mission involves a landing on the moon or on a planet and then a return to earth , two sets of conditions must be considered : reentry into the earth 's atmosphere and entry into the atmosphere of either the moon or a planet . The principal factors to be considered for entry into the atmosphere of the moon or a planet are the density and composition of the atmosphere . Let us dispense with the launching conditions at earth as compared with reentry conditions . Although the atmospheric cover of the earth is different in composition and density from that of the moon or the planets , in each instance the densest part of the atmosphere is at the surface . On launching , the velocity is zero at the surface where the density is greatest and increases as altitude is gained and the density becomes less . The velocity at exit from the atmosphere is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat protection and strength of the spacecraft are concerned , the reentry conditions are more severe than the launch conditions . The reentry conditions are then the critical design conditions . From a complete analysis of what happens during reentry , the designer must select the most severe combination of heating and loading , considering the material to be used . At peak heating the loading is probably not the highest , but when the heating is highest the strength of the material is reduced , and some load considerably less than the maximum might produce the least margin  | Figure 10 . Typical Blunt and Winged Shapes for Spacecraft . of safety between actual and allowable stress in the material . The spacecraft may have a blunt or winged shape . If blunt , the degree of bluntness will depend upon certain conditions . The high resistance of a very blunt shape has the advantage over one less blunt of causing the spacecraft to decelerate at high altitudes where the atmospheric density is low , resulting in a lower heating rate than for the spacecraft with a less blunt shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are shown in Figure to . These represent the extremes in design ranging from an L/D ratio of zero for the blunt shape to as high as 2.0 for the winged design . There are a number of designs that are possible between these extremes in which a modest L/D ratio of from %Z to x y2 is possible . These involve a design that is neither winged nor extremely blunt ; they can best be described as lifting-body designs in which some lift is obtained through the shape of the body . The NASA M-2 designs are of this type ( see Figure 1 ) . The blunt shapes have no aerodynamic maneuvering capability but can control their landing sites a modest amount by retro-rockets and maneuvering-jets . From a blunt-body earth-orbital satellite , the landing point on the earth 's surface beneath the orbital path may be selected with considerable accuracy by timing the initiation and duration of the retro-rocket firing . This timing , of course , must be very accurately coordinated with the position of the satellite over the earth and its altitude . From an orbital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross-track position may be altered a little by means of maneuvering-jets . The amount , however , is only a relatively few miles in comparison with a winged spacecraft . A winged spacecraft with an L/D ratio of as much as 2.0 could easily maneuver for a landing to almost any place within the continental limits of the United States from the above altitude . Reentry would have to be initiated , that is , retro-rockets fired , from possibly as far away as three thousand miles from the west coast of the United States . Spacecraft with lifting bodies as contrasted to wings do not have as much maneuvering capability , but astronauts may still have as much as one thousand miles in which to select a landing point . SPACECRAFT STRUCTURE The spacecraft structure must satisfy a variety of requirements . Not only must it have the proper external shape to produce the  | lift and resistance desired in the atmosphere , but it must be capable of withstanding the loading and heating encountered during all conditions under which it must operate . In addition it must be capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example . Figure 12 shows the relationship between altitude and velocity , deceleration , and heating of a reentering body . No scale is shown on the abscissa as the values change depending upon the shape of the spacecraft . It is only intended here to show the nature of the variation ; the actual values must be calculated for each specific design . The velocity of a spacecraft returning from space will depend upon the mission from which it is returning . If the spacecraft is returning from an earth satellite orbit , the velocity will depend upon the altitude of the orbit . If it is returning from a circumlunar mission , it will be reentering the atmosphere at a different velocity . If the spacecraft is returning from an exploration of Mars , there will be still a different velocity , but whatever the velocity of reentry , it will decrease as soon as the earth 's atmosphere is encountered . The rate of decrease will increase as the atmosphere becomes denser . As the velocity decreases , the deceleration and  | heating rate increase until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deceleration and heating rate is reached , then the deceleration and heating rate will decrease . The structure of the spacecraft must be designed to tolerate this maximum deceleration and heating . A material and a type of construction must be selected to do this . It would be desirable to select just one material to take care of both deceleration and heating ; in practice it may not be possible to do this as a material selected for its good heat protection properties may not be good from a strength standpoint and vice versa . In such cases a compromise results with the inner shell material selected for strength and the outer shell material selected for its heat protection properties . A type of construction can be selected that will provide protection against meteoroids . An efficient technique is to provide a thin outer shell through which the meteoroids can penetrate . Some of the energy of the meteoroids is absorbed by this shell and the remainder is absorbed by a lightweight material between the inner and outer shells . Another method that may be used is to eliminate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightweight material that will absorb all the energy from the impinging meteoroids . What may be done is to provide enough thickness for the basic wall to absorb all of the energy , but this means that additional thickness must be provided over the entire surface to take care of the anticipated depth of penetrations . This method is likely to result in a structure heavier than either of the other two methods , as the basic material will be quite dense . HEAT-PROTECTION METHODS AND MATERIALS There was a time at the beginning of the ballistic missile program when many scientists seriously doubted whether the missile nose cones , as they were called then , could reenter the earth 's atmosphere without burning up . Now a number of methods of heat protection and many suitable materials are known . These methods will be discussed with the advantages and disadvantages of each . Ablation Method The ablation method of heat protection is the most common method used today . Ablation is a term that has been used for  | many years by astronomers and astrophysicists to describe the process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is now also used to describe one method of heat protection for reentering spacecraft . This process involves the selection of a material that will undergo a change of state at the temperatures experienced upon reentry . Heat is absorbed as this change of state takes place . The change may be from a solid to a liquid , from a solid to a liquid to a gas , or directly from a solid to a gas , which is a special form of ablation called sublimation . As the shell of protective material ablates , decomposed products leave the surface and tend to decrease the transfer of heat through the boundary layer by an insulation effect . As much as io , 000 Btu per pound may be absorbed by the proper selection of an ablative material . Desirable characteristics for good ablative materials are a low density and thermal conductivity , a high latent heat of fusion , and a high viscosity when fluid . There is a long list of materials that may be used ; some are better for specific applications than others . The following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reader with an idea of the number and type of materials that might be considered . Each have their advantages and disadvantages . figure  | In addition there are a number of special materials such as ceramics reinforced with metal fibers , and special types of construction such as metal honeycombs filled with a ceramic material . Heat-Sink Method The heat-sink method of heat protection was used for the first ballistic missile designs . This method depends upon the conduction of heat away from the surface to be cooled . A material with a high thermal conductivity and a large heat capacity must be selected . It is also desirable for the material to have a high melting temperature , high reflectivity , and a low surface-temperature gradient . It is difficult to find a material with all these characteristics . After a rather extensive program of testing , copper was selected for the first ballistic missile nose cone design in spite of its rather low melting temperature . It does have a high thermal conductivity and can be coated with a suitable material to improve its radiation properties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiation , liquid metal , and magnetohydrodynamics . None of these have been used operationally but have undergone extensive laboratory testing . Transpiration Method The transpiration method of heat protection involves a process of forcing a fluid through small pores in the surface to be cooled . A porous material may be used or holes can be drilled . A pressure system must be used to force the fluid used through the pores . Heat protection is afforded in two ways : the fluid passing through the pores cools the material and then as it flows over the surface provides an insulating layer . If a fluid is selected that vaporizes in passing through the pores or afterward , additional heat is absorbed . Considerations in selecting this method of heat protection are the following : the fluid must have a high heat capacity and a high heat transfer coefficient between the fluid and the surface of the spacecraft . Radiator Method The radiator method of heat protection utilizes a radiator or heat exchanger for cooling the fluid used . The fluid is circulated through tubes beneath the surface to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to insure circulation through the  | radiator or heat exchanger . The characteristics for the fluid selected must be the same as those used for transpiration heat protection . Radiation Method The radiation method of heat protection involves the dissipation of heat from the spacecraft surface back to the atmosphere . Each of the previous methods involves some radiation of heat back to the atmosphere , but the radiation method depends entirely upon the control of heat by this method . A material that has high radiation characteristics and a high melting temperature must be selected . Liquid Metal Method The liquid metal method of heat protection uses the same principle as the radiator method with the exception that a metal which is liquid at the temperature involved is used instead of a nonmetallic liquid . Magnetohydrodynamie Method The magnetohydrodynamic method of heat protection utilizes the principle of changing the flow of the ionized air surrounding a reentering spacecraft by means of a superposed magnetic field . Comparison of Heat Protection Methods The first two methods discussed , ablation and heat-sink , are much simpler than any of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reentry from satellite orbits so long as the total reentry time is not too high ; that is , if the spacecraft is not subjected to heating over too long a time . For high-speed returns from outer space the spacecraft must be slowed by retro-rockets before entering the atmosphere as ablative and heat-sink materials have limited absorption capabilities based on Btu per pound per unit of time . In order to reduce the deceleration and thereby the heating on high-speed reentries from outer space , the angle of approach to the earth 's surface may be decreased . The rate of heating is decreased by doing this , but of course , the total reentry time is greater , thus increasing the total heat . This procedure requires very careful control of the angle of reentry . If the angle is too steep , the rate of heating becomes too high ; if it is too shallow , there is danger of the spacecraft 's just grazing the earth 's atmosphere and shooting into space again .  | The high-speed reentries from outer space in the future may utilize one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transpiration or radiator . These methods are both quite efficient for long total reentry times and should be fully developed before such missions are common . For low total reentry times , the transpiration and radiator methods are very low in efficiency ; ablation and heat-sink are much higher . The main disadvantage of both the transpiration and radiator methods are complexity and weight . The total weight of each system must include the weight of the fluid required . In the transpiration method the fluid is ejected and not recovered , so more fluid needs to be carried than for the radiator method , in which the fluid is recirculated . The overall weight of each method is quite high due primarily to the pumps and tubing required . Due to the pumping system and mechanical moving parts some maintenance may be required . Reliability is lowered for these two systems , and the cost is increased over that for either the ablation or heat-sink method . The radiation method of heat protection does not lend itself to handling high heat-transfer rates unless high surface-temperatures can be tolerated . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an insulation material that can be used immediately under the radiation material must be selected . This method of heat protection by itself is not usually considered for high-speed spacecraft reentries . It is of interest mainly for high-speed aircraft flying at high altitudes . For this application the heat transfer rate is low in comparison with that for spacecraft reentries . Neither the liquid metal nor the magnetohydrodynamic method of heat protection is beyond the laboratory-stage at present . A very high temperature may be handled by the liquid-metal method , but the system tends toward excessive weight due to the liquid metal involved , pumps , and piping . This system is complex and costly due to the special pumps required . Special problems that are as yet unsolved are the corrosion tendencies of some metals and alloys , the difficulty in maintaining tight joints and good seating for valves , the difficulty in keeping impurities out of the liquid metal used , and the problems involved in preheating the system so that the metal used for cooling is liquid at the temperature at which it is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so  | it is a problem to keep them separated . The liquid-metal system must operate under high pressure . There is a generally low reliability associated with such a system . A large amount of electrical equipment is necessary to operate a magnetohydrodynamic system . This equipment is heavy and may require special cooling equipment in addition . PHYSIOLOGICAL PROBLEMS The main physiological problems to be considered are the following : provisions for food and water ; an acceptable breathing mixture ; control of temperature , pressure , and humidity ; removal of objectionable odors , and body-waste disposal . For long flights , facilities must be provided so that the occupants may remain physically and mentally fit . This requires a means for physical and mental exercise , provisions for bodily cleanliness , and maintenance of a **27;155;TOOLONG cycle . The occupants must also be protected against radiation . To provide the most comfortable living conditions for human occupants inside the spacecraft it is desirable to provide conditions of temperature , humidity , pressure , and oxygen that most nearly approximate what the occupants are used to on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost more in weight than can be afforded ; therefore , the designer must arrive at a compromise . He is probably allowed the least deviation from the optimum in the case of temperature and humidity . The human body can not be allowed to become too hot or too cold because it becomes uncomfortable . An uncomfortably high or low temperature can be aggravated by excessively high or low humidity . Either an exceptionally moist or exceptionally dry skin condition can add to the discomfort of either a hot or cold skin surface . In Chapter III , conditions were discussed that are necessary to support life on other planets ; desirable conditions within a small capsule are somewhat different . The fact that astronauts are so closely confined within the capsule makes some conditions much more critical than if they had more freedom . The equipment to control temperature , pressure , humidity , and circulation of air should be designed so that conditions may be maintained within acceptable ranges .  | Temperature Temperature is one of the most critical environmental factors within a capsule , but 68 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be maintained . An acceptable humidity within the capsule must be maintained at the same time . A good deal of the heat buildup within a capsule is generated by the occupants ' bodies . Some heat comes from the sun , and some is generated by electrical equipment . For some missions far out in space , additional heat might be required which would have to be provided by a heating system . For other missions it might be necessary to dissipate heat . As very little heat can be transferred by radiation to space , an internal cooling system may have to be used . The system would consist basically of coolant tubes , a circulatory pump , and a heat exchanger . Humidity A relatively low humidity is desirable for comfort ? between 30 and 6o percent . Both extremely high and extremely low humidities are uncomfortable . In order to maintain a mean relative humidity , three pounds of water per occupant must be removed from the atmosphere daily . This may be accomplished by using an absorbent material or by condensing the moisture as is done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capsule may be allowed to drop to as low as five pounds per square inch without discomfort as compared with normal atmospheric pressure of 14.7 pounds per square inch . If the mission is such that the moon or a planet is to be explored by the occupants , a pressure suit must be provided . Such suits afford protection to the occupants in the event of accidental decompression of the capsule . The suits can be designed for automatic pressurization in the event of an emergency . For this purpose a somewhat lower pressure is permissible , perhaps as low as 3.5 pounds per square inch . A low pressure has the added advantage of easier mobility for the astronauts when outside the capsule . Breathing Mixture A number of tests have been conducted using various breathing mixtures to determine the best combination of gases under the conditions of space flight . Pure oxygen may be used for short periods  | of time , or an oxygen-helium mixture may be used with the helium replacing nitrogen in the air which man breathes normally . Elimination of nitrogen over a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause some damage to the lungs . Tests are being made to determine what constitutes suitable breathing mixtures . Removal of Carbon Dioxide and Unwanted Odors Lithium hydroxide is one of the most efficient absorbent materials for the removal of carbon dioxide . It is capable of absorbing almost its own weight of carbon dioxide . Sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide are also good . Other methods are available if the added weight and power required can be tolerated . One method is molecular sieve-absorption , but carbon dioxide can not be recovered by this method . If the recovery of carbon dioxide is desired in order to generate oxygen , an ion-exchange electrodialysis system can be used . A system such as this will probably weigh more than the molecular sieve method . Unwanted odors caused by the deterioration of organic compounds ( paint , plastics , etc. ) , equipment operation , and bodily effluence can be removed easily by activated charcoal . Food Requirements The average daily food intake required per man is relatively easy to estimate for normal tasks , although the intake requirement does vary considerably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a man in a space environment , however , are not completely known due to limited experience . It is believed that 3,000 to 3,200 calories per man per day are adequate to satisfy the average astronaut . This can be provided with 1.3 pounds of dry food per man per day . To minimize storage space , freezedehydrated foods may be used . Foods that have the proper nutritional balance and variety should be selected . Water Requirements Estimates of the amount of water required per man per day vary considerably . Some estimates are as low as five pounds and others as high as nine pounds per man per day for drinking and washing . For missions of short duration , stored water may be carried , and somewhat less may be required if cramped quarters and pressure suits prevent washing . For long missions a regeneration  | system should be considered . A system of this type regenerates water from urine , respiration , condensation from the atmosphere , and wash-water . A procedure consisting of the following may be used : 1 . Removal of solids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activated charcoal . 3 . Removal of remaining impurities by electrodialysis. 4 . Treatment to prevent microorganismic growth by means of ultraviolet and chemicals . Maintaining a low weight for purification and regeneration equipment is a severe problem for the designer for long missions . Disposition of Waste Materials Waste materials consist of miscellaneous food wastes , debris , and dirt , as well as urine and feces . Again , for long missions , the collection and disposition of waste materials becomes a critical problem . For short missions the easy solution is simply to store the wastes and dispose of them at the end of the mission . For long missions it is desirable from the weight standpoint to reclaim as much as possible , dispose of some , and store only that which can not be reclaimed or disposed of otherwise . Facilities for Exercise and Recreation The limited confines of present-day spacecraft and even the slightly more spacious orbiting laboratories of the future do not provide enough space for the occupants to participate in some of the more active exercises with which they are familiar on earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will not only keep muscles conditioned but also keep the mind stimulated . This is necessary in order to reduce the tendency to boredom which accompanies long missions . A program of **27;184;TOOLONG should be scheduled into an arbitrary night-day cycle in such a way as to deviate as little as possible from a normal cycle of such activities . Radiation Since the start of the Space Age much has been learned about the radiation belts that surround the earth . Although some questions still remain to be answered regarding the origin of these  | radiation particles , knowledge of the nature of the radiation and the location of the belts enables spacecraft designers to shield occupants against this hazard . Some radiation originates with the sun , being particularly intense at the time of solar flare activity . Some radiation is of cosmic origin . Very little shielding is necessary to protect the skin against ultraviolet and infrared radiation from the sun . Only small amounts of shielding are required to protect spacecraft occupants against solar x-rays . To provide protection against the heavy ionizing rays and high-energy particles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided to protect against the most severe solar flares yet measured . Sometime in the future the use of nuclear propulsion for space vehicles will necessitate the designers ' shielding the occupants against radiation emanating from the reactor . Such a shielding can be provided now , but it is heavy . By careful attention to detail the structural material required may be used for a dual purpose ? load-carrying and radiation-shielding . PROPULSION AND ATTITUDE CONTROL The large amount of thrust required to start a spacecraft on its mission is provided by the launch vehicle . This vehicle separates when it has boosted the spacecraft to the desired velocity and the spacecraft is pointed in the right direction . After this separation many missions still require small amounts of thrust . It may be required for midcourse or terminal guidance on missions whose destination is the moon or a planet . A thrust as small as one hundred pounds might be sufficient for this purpose with a thrust-vector control capability . Orientation or attitude control of the spacecraft may be required during the flight , either for pointing the vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or for reentry . A small jet capability will ordinarily be sufficient for this purpose ; as little as one pound of thrust might be adequate . This can be obtained using a pressurized gas , possibly nitrogen . A combination of thrust and correct attitude may be required to inject the spacecraft into an earth orbit . Retro-rockets may be necessary to propel a spacecraft out of an earth orbit after a mission has been accomplished . Maneuvering-type spacecraft need propulsion for two purposes : maneuvering during the docking operation  | of a rendezvous mission , and maneuvering during reentry to arrive at a preselected site . A design may be used that incorporates an attitude-control capability and maneuver capability in one thrustunit . For missions of extremely long duration of the future to deep space , nuclear-propelled rockets might be used . The low-level thrust applied continuously over a long period of time gradually builds up the velocity necessary to reach far-distant places in minimum time . The design of compact reactors , capable of tremendous power , is under study at the present . SECONDARY POWER SUPPLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various instruments and items of equipment necessary for the mission . Such a source must be economical in weight , size , and cost , and must be reliable over long periods of time . Some form of closed system must be used for missions of long duration . An average electrical power range of z to io kw and a lifetime up to five years are the factors considered desirable for manned spacecraft . Common systems to be considered will now be discussed . Fuel Cells These produce electricity by a chemical reaction at the electrodes . Their efficiency is high , 6o percent or better , and they are fine for short duration missions . For long missions , longer than thirty days , for example , the weight might become excessively high due to the fact that the chemical fuel must be replenished . Chemical Batteries The principle of operation for chemical batteries for space missions is the same as that for surface vehicles . Nickel-cadmium and silver-cadmium batteries are quite commonly used for space missions of short duration and relatively low power levels , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power requirements . Solar Cells These convert solar energy to electrical energy . The most common method is by means of photovoltaic cells . Their efficiency is low , but they are quite reliable and will deliver electrical energy  | over a long period of time . Methods of reducing the abrasive action of meteorites and keeping the cells oriented toward the sun are major problems . The developmental cost of solar cells is relatively low , but the operational cost is high , and there is a storage problem when they are stowed , due to their large size . There are new systems being developed which utilize solar energy directly ; one system which shows promise uses a mirror to collect solar radiation , then uses the heat generated to heat the fluid in a turbogenerator . Thermionic Converters These convert heat directly into electricity . The basic principle involves heating a cathode and collecting the electrons emitted at the anode to become the working fluid in a heat engine . The thermocouple principle may also be used to convert heat energy directly into electrical power . This method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there are chemical and metallurgical problems to be solved . Dynamic Converters These systems involve a turbogenerator using a liquid or gaseous working fluid . An example of the type of fluid that might be used is mercury vapor , although there are many problems associated with any liquid-metal system , due mainly to increased complexity . The designs of joints , seals , and pumps are particularly difficult design problems . Nuclear Systems These systems may use a nuclear reactor as the source of heat for any method of power supply requiring heat for its operation . The method requires heavy equipment and shielding and is quite expensive . Such a system is not competitive unless a large electrical output is required . COMMUNICATIONS It is necessary to maintain two-way communication with a manned spacecraft for several reasons . On flights of long duration , communication is a means of maintaining a high level of morale among the occupants . Knowing that they can communicate with persons on the ground tends to relieve their feelings of complete isolation . Many of the routine readings of instruments and equip- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spacecraft or the occupants , may be telemetered automatically , but direct voice communication with the occupants is desirable for nonroutine situations in which it is necessary for the occupants to transmit information on how malfunctioning instruments or equipment are behaving . Ground-recipients of the information may in turn relay information on how to repair or bypass the malfunctioning items . Communications are also necessary when ground-personnel want to relay instructions for special , nonprogrammed maneuvers . INSTRUMENTS AND EQUIPMENT The variety of instruments and equipment available for space experiments makes it inadvisable to describe every item . These items are usually selected by the scientists in charge of the experiment rather than by the chief spacecraft designer , but the two must work together very closely . The scientists in charge of the experiment must know the environmental conditions under which their instruments and equipment must operate : g-loads , temperature , vibration , and so forth . The spacecraft designer must know the weight and space required . LANDING AND RECOVERY Reentry of the spacecraft was discussed earlier in this chapter . After reentry a means must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water or land . A landing on water has the advantage that the landing place is more accessible than some places on land . An error in landing on water would delay a pickup but not as long as landing in an inaccessible place on land . For the landing , regardless of whether it is on land or water , various methods can be used to reduce the vertical rate of descent . Parachutes are one device that can be used , balloons another . Both parachutes and balloons increase the drag during descent , but balloons have the added advantage of providing buoyancy for a waterlanding and acting as a marker . Retro-rockets can be used to reduce the vertical descent rate and are quite effective . Aerodynamic brakes can also be used to increase the drag . Wings on the spacecraft or a lifting-body are also quite effective . A lifting-body design is preferred over wings as the weight increase is less . Whatever additional weight is needed in either case for the final phase of  | the mission has to be boosted initially to the required velocity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A bag that can be inflated with gas immediately before impact to help absorb the energy at impact can be incorporated in the design . The bag may be inflated during descent thus increasing the drag and reducing the energy remaining to be absorbed at impact . A landing structure that will collapse but help absorb the final energy in doing so can be used . Materials that might be used in such a structure are metal honeycomb , frangible metal tubing , or balsa wood . Such a structure could be used for vertical descent velocities up to forty feet per second . Devices may be incorporated in the design to aid in locating the spacecraft after landing , by means of light , radio , or sound . A brilliant flashing light that is visible for a considerable distance may be used . The light-switch can be designed to operate automatically upon impact or can be turned on manually by the occupants . A radio transmitter can also transmit signals automatically to be picked up by direction-finding equipment . A newly developed radar reflector has the capability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and power to a distance of several hundred miles . It can be packaged compactly in a space of /2 x 3 x 6 inches and weighs only two ounces . It inflates to a diameter of thirty-nine feet . For water landings a sonar device can be used to transmit sound signals through the water . In addition , dye may be ejected to aid in detecting the spacecraft . Compact life vests and life rafts must be carried on all space missions in which there is any possibility of landing on water . They must be inflated easily and quickly and be of light weight . The life rafts must be extremely stable , and the life belts must be capable of supporting an astronaut wearing his space suit even though the suit is nearly filled with water .  | THE TECHNICAL DISCIPLINES INVOLVED IN SPACE SCIENCE IT CAN be deduced readily from the preceding chapters that space science is an extremely broad field and that , in fact , it encompasses all sciences . All the terrestrial sciences are required at one time or another in space science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms used to indicate the broad field in which the scientist works . Each scientist or engineer has a specialty in which he has been trained ; he is not expected to be a jackof-all-trades . A space engineer or scientist starting in the aerospace industry can work within the field of his specialty , advancing as he gains experience . After a time , if he shows a capacity for handling responsibility some supervisory duties may be added in his own field and later in related fields . As the supervisory positions become higher within a company , the base of knowledge required becomes broader . The individual engineer or scientist drifts away from being a specialist toward being a generalist , although some prefer to remain specialists , and a few maintain reputations as specialists even though they may be in supervisory positions . An idea of some of the roles played by scientists in various fields can be obtained from the following discussion of technical disciplines . Astronomy The work of astronomers in determining the position of the moon or planets is essential in planning a trajectory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important role in planning projects such as an orbiting astronomical laboratory to obtain better observations outside the earth 's atmosphere .  | Biology Biologists are involved in studies of the effects of space flight environment on plants and animals , including man . They will participate in the design of life-support systems . Chemistry Chemists are in great demand and are doing considerable research on various aspects of new space fuels and materials . They also work very closely with nuclear physicists on many applications of nuclear energy in space . Geology Geologists will be concerned with the design of instruments and equipment to obtain geological information from the moon and planets and the analysis and interpretation of this information . This information is necessary before manned space missions to these places are attempted . A geologist could quite logically be one of the first scientists to set foot on the moon or a strange planet . Mathematics From the preceding chapters it is apparent to the reader that mathematicians have played prominent roles in helping to untangle the mysteries of space , and they will continue to do so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space problem-solving . Medical Research Many medical researchers are medical doctors ; others have PhD degrees in physiology , psychology , biochemistry , biology , chemistry , and other fields related to medicine . They are involved in studies and tests of life-support systems and components and the effect of the space environment on animals and man . Metallurgy Materials continue to play a challenging role in space vehicle design . Metallurgists are continuously striving for new materials or modifications of old ones to withstand new limits of heating and loading . Materials which will better lend themselves to production techniques are also sought . Meteorology Meteorologists arc essential for every launching , not only to de-  | termine if weather conditions at the launch site will be acceptable but also to predict whether they will be acceptable at the landing time and place . They are also instrumental in the design of weather satellite systems that may enable long-range weather predictions to be made in the future . Later they will be involved in estimates of weather and climatic conditions on other planets . Physics Physics is a very broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other space science . Nuclear physicists are probably more in demand than any other physicists ; they work on studies of the origin of the universe and on theoretical and experimental studies of radiation and cosmic-ray effects on space vehicles and occupants . They are also involved in the design of nuclear propulsion systems and many other aspects of space exploration . Psychology Quite a lot of important aerospace work is done in the field of human engineering . This involves experimental psychological research into human factors and the relationship between man and machine . It involves tests of man 's ability to perform under the high stress conditions of space flight . Related Scientific Areas In addition to the scientists mentioned above , every kind of engineer is needed in the aerospace industry : not only aeronautical , astronautical , and aerodynamics engineers ; but electrical and electronics engineers are in great demand as well as mechanical , chemical , and civil engineers . Some engineers are involved in design work in the field of their specialty ; others become involved in a major field of their broad engineering curriculum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structures , instrumentation , weights , guidance and control , and aerodynamics are major fields . Other engineers go into related fields in which their particular engineering backgrounds are desirable but not absolutely essential . These are fields such as reliability , sales engineering , manufacturing , launch engineering , equipment , or field service work . Another way of gaining insight into the work done by space scientists and engineers is to look at the scope of the technical cornmittces of a major technical society devoted to space science such  | as the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics . A brief statement of the scope of each of these committees follows . Astrodynamics The determination , improvement , prediction , and physical adjustment of trajectories in space ; space navigation and rendezvous , reentry trajectories ; attitude optimization ; perturbation theory and expansions ; differential correction and statistical processes ; and observation reduction .

Thermophysics Study and applications of the properties and mechanisms involved in thermal-energy transfer within and between solids , and between an object and its environment , particularly by radiation ; study of environmental effects on such properties and mechanisms . The scope of each committee 's responsibilities has been carefully defined to keep overlap and duplication of effort at a minimum . Most companies engaged in space-work operate on a Project Office system ; Figure 13 shows the highlights of such a system . The design work is done by a group of design specialists who work only on one project . When the design work on the project is completed , they are transferred to aid other uncompleted projects , or they may be assigned to start the design of a new project . In some instances these specialists work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although the design group works only on one project at a  | Figure 13 . Coordination Involved in a Typical Project-Office Operation . time , there are other offices with which the Project Office deals that service or support all projects within the company ; these are Research , Manufacture , Test , Budget , and External Procurement . The combination of Design and Test is what is normally called Development . In most progressive companies these functions are closely associated with Research . The research performed is usually a combination of basic and applied research in the fields showing the greatest promise for the business in which the company is engaged . Basic research is accomplished with the hope that something new will be discovered which will radically change the performance or cost of an article in which the company has a strong interest . This might be a new process , technique , or a wholly new  | idea that might result in a new proposal . Applied research is accomplished to improve or correct a defect in some part of an existing article . Manufacturing tools are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate manufacturing lines unless many copies of each of more than one article are to be built . If only one article of each is to be built , the schedule of each is so tight that neither may be slipped , and duplicate machine tools have to be used . Usually , manufacturing operations can be scheduled so that the machines needed for each article are not needed at the same time . Launches of special space missions are infrequent enough so that the same launch crew can be used for the launch of different projects if the basic launch vehicle is the same . If different launch vehicles are used , there are enough differences in procedure to warrant the use of a different launch crew ? one that is experienced on that particular vehicle . Besides , different launch stands would be required . The Budget and External Procurement Offices are other offices that support various project offices , manufacturing , and other departments of the company . When one attempts to chart the various lines of coordination involved between multiple project offices and Research , Budget , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scheme similar to Figure 14 . In practice these overlapping lines are even more numerous than are shown here . For example , each of the subsystems or components-design units has a firsthand interest in both the manufacture and testing of its particular part of the project . These lines are not shown . In some instances special tests may have to be conducted on these separate subsystems and components prior to being entrusted to a launch of the complete system . These special tests may require special facilities that need the attention of both the Project Office and the subsystem or component-design unit . Space Project Cycle A space project of sufficient importance to involve the expenditure of a considerable sum of money over a period of several years usually follows a typical cycle . The concept for a new project usually develops from studies based on research that is contin-  | Coordination Involved Between Multiple Project Offices and Common Research , Budget , Manufacture , External Procurement , and Test Offices . uously accomplished by private industry , educational institutions , and governmental agencies . Advanced planning groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an early stage whether potential space usefulness exists . When such potential has been established , studies are started with the idea of identifying a concept and working out the details of a space project utilizing this concept . Then the mission requirements are confirmed and evaluation studies performed to insure that the requirements mesh with the project details . If everything looks well at this point , detailed plans are prepared for the various future phases of the project ; these will involve design , development , test , and opera-  | tional procurement and use . The plans will include schedules and costs computed as accurately as possible . These project plans are presented to the level of management , in the organization concerned , that has the authority to approve the project and allocate funds for its prosecution . If it is a project that requires governmental approval and governmental funds , the company level to which it is presented must have the authority to approve the plans for presentation to the governmental agency concerned . After the proper agency has approved the project and funds have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plans . As the project progresses through design , production , and test toward eventual operational use , a number of changes will be necessary in the original plans . If there are major changes that affect the schedule or funds required , the original approval channel should be followed and the proper organizations informed . Some of the changes may occur during the final design phase . Other changes may take place during production , and some changes may be made necessary as a result of flight tests . Another part of the project cycle will be the supporting technology that takes place as a result of flight tests or advanced research . As the project advances and flight tests and advanced research results become available , the capability of the project becomes better known , and growth studies can parallel the final stages in the project cycle . Academic Foundation for Work in Space Science To provide the proper foundation for work in space science many colleges and universities offer four- and five-year curricula in science and engineering leading to bachelors and masters degrees . These curricula are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools also offer graduate work leading to a doctorate . The higher degrees ( masters and doctorates ) enable a graduate engineer or scientist to start employment at a better position and at a higher salary . In many instances , an advanced degree also allows one to advance faster , provided , of course , that he exhibit competence and initiative at his job . An idea of starting-salaries may be obtained by referring to Table IX . ' This table shows the average starting salary offers to  | University of Colorado graduates of the classes of 1964 , 1965 , and 1966 . Beginning salaries for those graduating with a masters degree averaged roughly $150 per month more than those graduating with a bachelors degree . A more comprehensive nationwide survey is available from the College Placement Council , Bethlehem , Pennsylvania . It may , however , be more meaningful to compare the averages for one university rather than use nationwide averages , even though the average salary in some instances is for a small number of students . figure The curricula of most schools for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mathematics and science requirements , plus perhaps a start in a language and mechanics . For the third , fourth , and perhaps fifth years , advanced mathematics  | courses and courses in the fundamentals through advanced work in the engineering or science field in which one wishes to specialize are pursued . Some schools offer a few elective courses from which a selection may be made to supplement the required curriculum . Some schools require an undergraduate thesis ; others do not require a thesis until the student is beyond the bachelors level . A dissertation is almost universally required in connection with a doctorate . Most graduate schools encourage students to choose electives from a wide variety of courses offered in the humanities to broaden their education in the nonscientific disciplines . The percentage of engineers and scientists with graduate degrees on the staffs of technically-oriented companies is gradually increasing . A bachelors degree was formerly the goal toward which one worked in college ; now it is a minimum requirement rather than a maximum . Graduate work is necessary to obtain advanced knowledge in a specialty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the various aspects of space science has been broken down into subheadings under the major headings of Fundamental Sciences , Applied Sciences , Professional Engineering Subjects , Professional Sciences Subjects , and Advanced Science and Engineering Subjects .

As the results from space programs are analyzed , new avenues for investigation become apparent . This , coupled with the increasing performance capability of our exploratory vehicles , will expand our perimeter of exploration . This expansion of our sphere of exploration might be compared with the expansion of the universe itself . Nuclear power appears to have a very great potential for the future . However , it does not appear , even with the rapid increase in propulsion technology and other technologies associated with spacecraft development , that man can ever devise vehicles that will enable him to catch up with the far-distant galaxies . These are receding from us at such tremendous velocities that man will have to content himself with the exploration of our own solar system for the immediate future , and after that , exploration of other stellar systems in our own galaxy . This should keep man busy for many years . As the rate of expansion of the universe appears to be decreasing , perhaps by the time man has the capability to explore beyond our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as man 's space exploration capability increases , the necessity for increased capability decreases . That is , the areas for new exploration will be getting closer and closer to us . However , if the theory involving eventual contraction of the universe is correct , it appears to be impossible for man to escape ultimate annihilation as everything in space will eventually come together . If this occurs , it means that we can expect the cycle of the universe from creation to death to be repeated . It may have been repeated many times in the past . As the trend of events can not  | be determined for billions of years , perhaps it is best to speculate on space plans only a little beyond the specific immediate plans but not quite so far into the future as a billion years . Even with this limitation it is difficult to predict what the future will hold , but it is certain that more information will be obtained about space as the space missions become more ambitious . These new bits and pieces of information about space will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin of the earth and other planets , the sun , the stars , and the universe . The source of the tremendous energy in space is a fundamental unknown . The energy generated by our own sun , which is radiated into space to the earth and other planets , can be roughly calculated . Other stars are also delivering huge quantities of energy to space , many of them a much greater amount than our own sun . This astronomically great energy is almost beyond human comprehension . It is hoped that space missions of the future will contribute to the solution of this major problem . The space plans of the future can be divided into scientific , commercial , and military plans . The bulk of the plans for the immediate future are of the scientific category . Scientific space missions will continue to be designed to increase our knowledge about space . More detailed information about electrons , the ion-mass spectrum , solar radiation and cosmic rays will be obtained and many questions about the universe will be answered . This general information will be obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solar planetary flights . As more becomes known about space , more commercial uses and perhaps some military applications will be found . Fulfilling the objectives of specific missions becomes more difficult as we probe farther into space . It is a relatively simple matter to calculate the path that a vehicle must follow if the motions of the body from whence the vehicle is departing and the motions of the body that it must reach are accurately known ; it is another problem and much more difficult , however , to provide the propulsive force and guidance that are required to achieve the desired trajectory . A very small percentage error may result in a miss at the destination of tens of thousands of miles . Both the United States and the USSR have had considerable success with orbital flights using instruments , animals , and  | finally men . Initially the United States had considerable difficulty with lunar flights prior to the highly successful Ranger 7 photographic mission in July , 1964 . The USSR has had similar difficulty with various types of space flights ; it has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the moon , Venus , and Mars . The United States had a highly successful flight to the vicinity of Venus early in 196o ; this was the Pioneer V mission . Both the United States and the USSR have extensive programs for future space exploration . For all missions there is a long list of questions that it is hoped will be answered . It is also hoped that among the answers will be found clues to the possibility of life elsewhere in the solar system , in our galaxy , or in the universe , in addition to uncovering clues to the origin of the universe . Space flight missions for the purpose of exploring a particular body in space generally will follow a sequence of events such as the following : 1 . Instrumented flights . 2 . Animal flights . ( This step will be eliminated in some instances. ) 3 . Manned flights . MISSION PRIORITIES The areas explored will , of course , be at greater distances from the earth and larger payloads carried as the propulsion capability increases . As this capability increases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the order of distance from the earth . This would place lunar exploration at the highest priority , Mars next , then Venus , the major planets , and finally Mercury and Pluto , with comets , asteroids , and the satellites of other solar planets appropriately interspersed in the overall space exploration plan . Brief comments on these various missions follow with some tabulation of the main areas of concern . The Moon Lunar missions can be divided into orbiters and landers . The primary areas of concern for each type of mission are the fol-lowing : 1 . The nature of the lunar surface and the processes which modify it . 2 . The evolutionary sequence of events which have led to the present condition of the moon 's surface .  | Orbiters At least the first orbiters can be unmanned . The primary function of orbiters will be to select a landing site , and for this purpose orbiters will be equipped with stereoscopic cameras to determine the nature of the lunar topography at close range . Orbits at various inclinations will permit mapping of the entire lunar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to determine temperature and pressure at the lunar surface will be carried . Landers The very first lunar landers were those which crash-landed . These proved the ability to hit the moon and were able to relay photographic information about the moon 's surface as it was approached . Next are soft-landers with no return capability . These will be concerned with photographing the lunar surface at close range and obtaining readings of temperature , pressure , micrometeoric hits , particle environment , and seismic disturbances from automatic transmitting devices deposited upon the surface . Finally , there will be soft-landers with the capability of returning . These will obtain dust and rock samples , sterile and free from any contaminants from fuel or exhaust . For this reason samples will be taken as far away from the landing craft as possible . These landing craft will also leave automatic devices on the surface to transmit frequent readings of temperature , pressure , micrometeoric hits , particle environment , and seismic disturbances . Mars Mars missions will be concerned mainly with the following : 1 . The existence of life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 . The presence and character of carbon chemistry . 4 . Micrometeorology. 5 . Identification and classification of the surface environment . 6 . The determination of atmospheric and surface composition . 7 . The determination of the nature of thermal emissions from the surface in the infrared region . Venus The nature of the atmosphere , surface , and interior of Venus  | are entirely different from those of the earth or Mars , so the first priority is the determination of the exact nature of these differences . The Major Planets Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus , and Neptune pose extremely interesting scientific questions due to their large masses and low densities . Several different types of orbiters might be used in addition to landers : 1 . Low-altitude orbiters for geodetic purposes . 2 . Eccentric orbiters for observing satellites of the planets . 3 . Low-altitude inclined-orbiters for studying special features like the red spot of Jupiter . A minimum-energy flight to Uranus would require sixteen years . Data transmission from Jupiter , Saturn , and Uranus is considered to be respectively 12 , 40 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mercury and Pluto Mercury and Pluto are considered to be of rather low priority . Not much is known about the physical characteristics of Mercury except that due to its closeness to the sun it is very hot . Pluto at its tremendous distance away from the sun is very cold . Other Bodies Comets , asteroids , the satellites of other planets , and interplanetary dust will be investigated at appropriate times during the investigations of large celestial bodies . During exploratory flights the commercial and military potential will always be analyzed . Examples of commercial and military applications include communications , meteorological information , and navigation . Some scientific applications have a military potential : for example , the equipment , instruments , and techniques used for photographing and mapping celestial bodies may also be used for military reconnaissance and surveillance of these bodies . Areas of Continuous Research In man 's efforts to go farther and farther away from the earth , major technological advances are required in many areas . The state of the art must be continuously advanced in major fields such as the following : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | payloads deep into space . The propulsion systems will also need to be capable of boosting payloads at velocities far above that for minimum energy in order to traverse great distances in minimum time . Guidance and trajectory control capable of accomplishing two or three midcourse changes . Such a system must be capable of landing a spacecraft within 250 miles of a preselected site as far away as Mars . Stabilization systems must be developed that are capable of stabilizing synchronous satellites within ? 20 . Advanced communications capable of at least 5,000 to 10,000 bits per second over distances of 250 million miles . This will require 50-watt transmitters on board the spacecraft and a high-gain antenna up to ten feet in diameter as well as large dishes on the ground . Life-support systems capable of supplying the needs of eight to twelve men for a period of six months for the immediate future . For periods in excess of six months , the needs could be handled by resupply . Methods of condensing foods and making artificial foods must be refined and efficient systems for the generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flexible and durable enough to permit working on the surface of the moon and climbing in and out of a lunar surface vehicle . Instruments and equipment must be developed to permit accurate measurements of the solar wind , interplanetary magnetic fields , the micrometeoric flux , electron temperatures , solar and galactic cosmic-ray flux and to collect and analyze dust particles . On flyby missions near other celestial bodies it will also be important to detect and measure the amount of water vapor and carbon dioxide and to measure surface temperatures . Television cameras must be refined for accurate inspection of surface conditions . Secondary power devices capable of several kw are necessary for the immediate future . The electrical power requirement will approach r , 000 kw for the sophisticated missions of the distant future . Both nuclear and radioisotopic sources of power should be considered . These present two additional problems : those of radiation-shielding and an adequate production of isotopes . All present  | secondary-power devices have much room for improvement from the standpoint that all have rather low efficiencies . In addition to increasing efficiency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the standpoint of reliability . Solar cells , for example , are rather fragile and become easily damaged or broken ; perhaps they can be made more rigid , thus less fragile . Perhaps a new material will be required to do this . If the cells can be made more rigid , then the supporting structure for them can be made less rigid , and thus weigh less . The total cost of the cells must be considered at all times . Fuel-cell development must concentrate on the development of more electrical power at less weight . Superconductivity is a field that justifies continuing research . Reliability must be kept in the forefront of each development program . Reliability for periods of continuous operation up to two years should be a goal . Biomedical . In the biomedical field it may be possible to surgically reinforce certain parts of the body against the stresses of space travel . Condensed or artificial foods may become commonplace . The Air Age required air terminals ; space stations will be required in the Space Age . Some of these will be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launchvehicles ' carrying a heavy load of fuel through the earth 's atmosphere and high-gravity region . A more modest load of fuel sufficient to reach a space way-station plus the fuel put on board at the way station is less than the total weight of fuel required if it were all put on board on earth . Other space stations may be equipped as permanent scientific laboratories to serve as weather stations , astronomical observatories , data collection centers , command and control centers for military missions , and perhaps as medical research centers for certain types of illnesses . From these earth-orbital space stations a technique should be developed that will permit the orbits of other earth satellites to be calculated from the space station . A system should be devised so that the position of any interplanetary spacecraft may be determined from on board the spacecraft .  | Facilities , projects , and activities that will aid in the advancement of space science are the following : 1 . Equatorial or near-equatorial launching sites . 2 . Linking of national and international tracking and data-acquisition networks . 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomena and terrestrial weather . 4 . A system of new , large optical and radio telescopes to aid , confirm , and otherwise support observations and investigations from space vehicles . 5 . A satellite data-collection system ? one that would collect information from widely dispersed and out-of-the-way sensing devices at sea , in high altitude balloons , and inaccessible ground-locations. 6 . Multipurpose satellite systems for navigation . 7 . New applications for communications satellites . a . Closed-circuit television ? linking of industrial facilities around the world . b . Transmittal of business correspondence : letters , reports , and other documents . c . Linking of industrial and space exploration computer operations . d . Worldwide linking of commercial television stations and the capability for stationary satellite television broadcasts directly to viewers . Ten kw may be needed to focus into a Y-5 ? beamwidth. e . To facilitate communications with and between aircraft , ships , and earth satellites . f . To aid in the exploration of distant planets . 8 . With the strong possibility that human beings will establish a base on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to establish an international committee that will consider such matters as sovereignty , the exchange of scientific information , and restriction of military activity . Although all countries interested in space exploration and having such a capability are concerned now primarily with the peaceful uses of space , it is inevitable that some technological advances will also have military applications . It is impossible to predict the nature of such advances , but if any do have a military potential , civilization must quickly put them under control or take the chance of being annihilated . Questions such as the following must be answered : Who knows which science-fiction devices will become reality ? Are antimatter weapons with power equal to many thousand times today 's H-bombs impossible ?  | Will thermonuclear power become great enough to devastate an entire nation with only one bomb ? Can plasma bombs be built that can be directed across the ground like bolts of lightning leaving nothing behind but a strip of desolation ? Is such a thing as an intercontinental death-ray a complete impossi-bility ? CONCLUSION Although a space vehicle can be operated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing this becomes ever more reliable , there are many situations requiring judgment that can not be exercised by instruments , and there will be an increasing number of manned space flights . As complete space vehicles become more reliable and as the capability is achieved for larger payloads , man will become more insistent upon exploring space firsthand rather than remotely . Over the centuries , man has had an insatiable curiosity and desire to explore the unknown : consider Columbus and the New World , and the gradual pushing back of the frontier of the New World ; the exploration of the North Pole , the South Pole , the highest mountains , and the depths of the oceans . In a similar manner will come the penetration of the space frontiers by man . First will , come the exploration of the moon , then the solar planets , the rest of our galaxy , and finally other galaxies . It is difficult to say what is impossible , for the dream of yesterday is the hope of today and the reality of tomorrow . ( DR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
