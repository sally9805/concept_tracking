The bestseller in Athens last week was , of all things , the French newspaper Le Monde . It was sold out within a few minutes after it appeared on the newsstands , and friends quickly passed around tattered issues to one another . The reason for the newspaper 's sudden popularity : it carried a ringing attack on Greece 's military rulers by the most popular of conservative Greek politicians . He is Constantine Karamanlis , 60 , the former Premier ( 1955-63 ) who gave Greece an unparalleled period of political stability and economic growth before a quarrel with Queen Frederika and an election loss to Liberal George Papandreou persuaded him to go into self-imposed exile in Paris . <P> For the past four years , Karamanlis has lived in Paris in a comfortable Bois de Boulogne duplex on funds supplied largely by wealthy Greek industrialists , but his name and words still have a magic effect in Greece . Bluntly calling the colonels " idiots " and " putschists , " he blamed them for the Cyprus debacle and warned that their continued rule could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country that " twice almost became the Viet Nam of Europe . " He called on the colonels " to recognize their duty " and resign . Said he : " Greeks will not allow the maintenance of dictatorship under whatever form . " <P> <P> Defiant Press . The junta , led by Colonel George Papadopoulos , was so preoccupied with Cyprus that it tried at first to ignore the criticism from Karamanlis . But when the colonels became aware of the furor that his words had caused in Greece , they sent a statement to the Greek press that characterized his actions as ill-timed , irresponsible , and " nationally unacceptable , " and compared them with those of the exiled boss of the Greek Communist Party . Until now , that part of the Greek press still operating has obediently followed the junta 's orders , but the attack on Karamanlis was simply too much . Two Athens publishers , Nassos Botsis and Panes Athanasiades , declared that they would rather go to prison than print such a charge in their three dailies . <P> <P> The colonels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cyprus , were unwilling to risk a showdown that would exacerbate their strained relations with Greece 's conservatives . Rather than arrest the publishers , the junta offered a compromise : if the newspapers would run the regime 's attack on Karamanlis on the main news page , they could run Karamanlis ' attack on the junta on an inside page . All eight Athens papers agreed , and Greek readers thereupon had the unusual experience of reading the first criticism of the junta since it seized power on April 21.
