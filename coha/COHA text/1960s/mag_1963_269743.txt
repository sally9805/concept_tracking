During the evenings at Gian Carlo Menotti 's Spoleto Festival of Two Worlds , the goings-on were grand . Festive Roman audiences wildly applauded Luchino Visconti 's lavish production of La Traviata . The Messiah was sung on the moonlit Piazza del Duomo that it might satisfy all the senses . When the festival 's sixth season neared its close , Founder Menotti looked ahead anxiously . " Everyone , " he sighed last week , " expects exceptional productions . It 's really tough figuring out how I will keep it up during the next ten years . " <P> Bed &; Board . But this year , at least , one of the most highly acclaimed offerings at Spoleto was one of the least glamorous . At the unlikely hour of noon , S.R.O . audiences jammed the 370-seat white-and-gold Teatro Caio Melisso for one-hour chamber-music concerts . Most came in shirtsleeves , and the musicians were equally casual . Programs were not printed , but scrawled on a blackboard outside the theater only a few hours before curtain time . They were still subject to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . <P> Just such intimacy between musicians and audiences once characterized performances of chamber music and was one of its greatest strengths . But the rapport was broken when chamber music moved into large concert halls , for which it was never intended . Four seasons ago , deciding that " Italy has gone through great decadence in chamber music , " Menotti launched the midday series at Spoleto as a long-shot restorative . Each summer since , about 50 similarly dedicated instrumentalists and singers from abroad have turned up for the series on nothing more than Menotti 's promise of bed and board . They have performed everything from 13th century motets to Korean twelve-tone , are directed by Georgia-born Pianist Charles Wadsworth , a noted lieder accompanist who performed at one of Jackie Kennedy 's White House soires . <P> Classical Jam Session . This season big-name musicians performing at the festival 's full-dress evening productions began to treat the chamber-music series as a sort of classical jam session . Thomas Schippers , who conducted the Spoleto Messiah , stopped by to play piano duets with a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Conductor Robert La Marchina ( Traviata ) , who was up early for the sake of a tuneful Rachmaninoff piano-cello sonata . What 's more , the musicians ' enthusiasm for the series seems to be shared by an Italian concert public long uninterested in chamber music . " One of the most original and happily realized formulas of the festival , " glowed Rome 's II Giornale d'ltalia . The Italian radio network helpfully broadcast most of the chamber music from Spoleto ; and a bank manager in Rome , getting wind of an especially good program of quartets , promptly closed his branch and rushed off to the festival matinee with his entire staff in tow .
