In past decades , pessimists delighted in predicting that the U.S. 's automobile explosion would eventually overtake the country 's highway system and bring traffic to a full stop . They did not allow for U.S. enterprise . On the East Coast , the continent 's most congested traffic corridor and the world 's biggest urban sprawl , a motorist can now whip along the 435-mile route between Washington and Boston without ever encountering a stop light . <P> This Detroit daydream come true was made possible last week by the opening of a new superhighway that bypasses " Gasoline Alley , " an elevenmile stretch of road south of Hartford with 18 stop lights and heavy local traffic , lined on both sides with aluminum diners , neon-lit drive-ins and stucco motels . <P> Elsewhere , the road ahead looks equally bright . There is not a single stop light on the highways linking Cleveland to Boston ( 650 miles ) , St. Louis to Wichita Falls , Texas ( 658 ) , and Macon , Ga. , to Miami ( 580 ) . The record for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the New York-to-Chicago stretch . For 845 miles - through the connecting expressways and turnpikes of New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Ohio , Indiana and Illinois-there is nothing to make a motorist brake except fatigue , an emptying gas tank , a toll station , or a state trooper . <P> The West , which is still a few paces behind in the interstate highway race , is closing fast . In the 1970s , a relentless roadrunner will be able to travel nearly 1,500 miles from Vancouver to Tijuana without ever seeing red .
