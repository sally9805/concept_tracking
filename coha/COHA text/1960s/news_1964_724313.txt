txt The neck-and-neck race for the Senate in New York State is , each day , drawing more and more ' national attention . This is the first of two interviews with the candidates . The Robert F. Kennedy interview will appear tomorrow . By Godfrey Sperling Jr . Chief of the New York Bureau of The Christian Science Monitor New York " Ticket splitting , " says Sen. Kenneth B. Keating ( a hopeful beneficiary of same ) , " is perfectly proper . " Further , the New York Senator , who is up against the stiff challenge of Robert F. Kennedy , says : " I 'm a Republican officeholder who has , in a few instances in the past , voted for a Democrat . " Senator and reporter were at lunch in Mr. Keating 's Roosevelt Hotel suite . The silver-haired Senator was only minutes back from a long hike on a Fifth Avenue parade route  --  but every hair was in place , and he showed no signs of the rapid , and sometimes heated , campaign pace . " Ticket splitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both parties . It tends to make the parties come up with better candidates . Strict party voting is apt to lead to the inference by party slatemakers that the voters will elect a candidate whoever he is . " " Voting for the man and not the party , " he said , " is on the increase . This is certainly true in New York State  --  and I think it is true throughout the nation . " I think this trend is a healthy sign . It shows that the people are becoming more discerning about their candidates . " Here the Senator paused with his ham sandwich and soup to stress a point . " Now I believe completely in the two-party system . And I think it should be strengthened . But without ticket splitting there would be a lot of splinter parties ( which would be a weakening element in our democratic processes ) . " And I definitely feel that not under any consideration should we feel that a man should be elected just because he is a member of a particular party . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberals be in one party and all conservatives in another . the Senator said : " I 've never favored this , although it is said by some that it should be done . I think it would weaken the two-party system . It would make both parties hide-bound . " Turning to other issues , the Senator said : ? That he " was very hesitant to call anyone ' soft on communism . ' " ? That he would " never make " the charge that some Republican candidates have made  --  that President Kennedy had deliberately timed the confrontation with Cuba in order to gain public support for the Democrats in the 1962 elections .  --  // Keating Urges Ticket Splitting // On the first point , he said : " I have many differences of opinion with others in government service in dealing with the Communists . But very few in political life are or could be called soft on communism . " Senator Keating said he felt there have been " from time to time concessions to the Communists " which he did n't agree with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft on communism . " On the charge of a Kennedy-timed confrontation over Cuba in 1962 , Senator Keating said : " I have said I could never make such a charge . I had no basis for charging this . . . " I was publicly much in the middle of it ICuba ) . as you know . On the night of Oct. 22 I was speaking in Utica . N.Y . I listened to the President and scrapped my speech . I then made a speech in which I directed all my remarks to the need for national unity . " Of the Kennedy entry into the New York races , the Senator said : " It could lead to a complete abandonment of the American system and the adoption of the British system ? where the candidate can come from any place . " Con-tinuing : " Our founding fathers said that the candidate should be an inhabitant of that state in which he was elected . And this has lasted all these years without an exception of any kind . " Rufus King Recalled The Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Kennedy . " The case of Rufus King of Massachusetts , " he said . " was entirely different . King came into New York State to woo  --  and vin  --  a woman who became his wife . Then he was elected to the New York State Assembly . " And he served there 3 year before he was selected by that assembly to be the United States senator . That was before the constitutional amendment that turned the election of senators over to the general public . It was King 's colleagues who selected him . " After lunch the Senator sat for a while for a news-magazine cover painting . In a jovial mood , he talked a bit about the " tough " questions he sometimes has to answer . " Out at the parade. - he said , " a Greek reporter asked me this question : ' How do you like celebrating the discovery of America by the Spanish ? ' This threw me off balance for a while . but I finally explained that this was Columbus Day , and we were celebrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been helped by the Spanish . " Spending Viewed How much was he spending in this campaign ? " More than the last time I ran , " he said , " but not as much as the opposition . " The Senator said that he was of modest means and that all his help was " coming from good friends . " At one point we asked him about the charge of immorality in government . Said Senator Keating : " I 'm trying diligently to keep the focus in my campaign on my record . So I have n't said much about this . " But there is no doubt about it : they endeavored to squelch the Bobby Baker thing . I 've criticized my opponent for deliberately staging the Valachi hearing ? to keep Bobby Baker out of the front pages . My opponent furnished all the witnesses . And not a single thing has ever come out of it ? not even a legislative proposal . " Continuing : " I 've been very critical of the Rules Committee for smothering the investigation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong code of ethics for members of the legislative branch and their employees . Sen. Jacob K. Javits and I have sponsored several bills on this . ' ' What did he think about dis-closure ? " I 'm very much in favor of mandatory disclosure of sources of income . One of my bills calls for the disclosure of any income from a federally regulated industry . I would like disclosure of all income . but at this point it seems impossible to get this much . " Philosophy Cited Bow did he see himself from an ideological standpoint ? Smiling , he said : " I 've called myself a ' liberative ' or a ' conserveral . ' In other words , I take each issue and consider it from two standpoints . Is it good for the nation ? And is it good for New York . If I think ' yes , ' I am for it . If I think ' no , ' I 'm against it . " In the matter of human needs  --  such as civil rights , housing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters affecting the use of public funds , I certainly would be called a conservative . In ' foreign affairs , I 've always had an internationalist outlook and would be called a liberal on this subject . " I 'm primarily a Keating Republican , but I have a great admiration for President Eisenhower . I 've found myself in agreement with many  --  but not all  --  of his policies . . ..
