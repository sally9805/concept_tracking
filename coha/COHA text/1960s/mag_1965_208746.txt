The school started as a gleam in its mother 's eye . Two decades ago , tiny Bonnie Cone , a math teacher hardly taller than a blackboard pointer , began directing a program of college extension courses for ex-G.I.s , using what had been the lost-and-found department of a Charlotte , N.C. , high school . This month the school that grew from there , with Miss Bonnie pushing it all the way , was designated the University of North Carolina at Charlotte , the juridical coequal of the state university branches at Chapel Hill , Greensboro and Raleigh . <P> " I knew I wanted to be a teacher before I even started the first grade , " Miss Bonnie says . After graduating from South Carolina 's tiny Coker College in 1928 , she taught mathematics in South Carolina high schools , and in 1940 moved on to Charlotte Central High School . During World War II , she taught math to hundreds of men in the armed forces ' V12 program at Duke University , finding time to pick up her own master 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of North Carolina set up a dozen extension centers , including one at Charlotte 's Central High School , to meet the demands of returning veterans . Miss Bonnie became director of the Central center in 1947 , nourished the place through a series of crises , still recalls the struggle to keep her faculty on the same pay scale as public-school teachers . " It was the only time I 've ever cringed to see schoolteachers get a pay increase , " she says . Working an average 14-hour day , seven days a week , Miss Bonnie still managed to get to the bedside of a sick child of a staff member-and to show up at the right doorstep in town when the school needed help from the community . Promoting higher taxes , she got local authorities to buy 227 acres for a campus eight miles northeast of Charlotte and build a plant worth $3,000,000 . With skillful lobbying from Charlotte , the 1963 general assembly was persuaded to put Miss Bonnie 's school-now Charlotte College-into the state 's four-year system . <P> This fall , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2,000 commuting students and a faculty of 84 . With its future growth seemingly assured , the big question for the campus now is : Will Miss Bonnie , who is acting chancellor , be appointed permanently ? Although her sex and her lack of an earned doctorate might be considered handicaps by some , Miss Bonnie , now 58 , is unconcerned . " Nobody here is worried about the future , " she says , " and I least of all . We are not here to elevate ourselves , but the institution . "
