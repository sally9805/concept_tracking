txt // rakers . The vertebral column extends from the skull to the base of the caudal fin . It is divided into trunk vertebrae and caudal vertebrae . There are paired ribs on the trunk vertebrae , but the caudal vertebrae have a single ventral hemal arch which supports the blood vessels in the tail . All the vertebrae have dorsal neural arches . The ribs have projections extending into the muscle , known as false ribs , which sometimes take much of the pleasure out of eating fish since they are so easily included with a bite of the muscle . The muscles are simple compared with those of land vertebrates . There are the myotomes , paired muscle masses , which alternate with the vertebrae . The myotomes are partially fused together to form groups of muscles , a pair of heavy bands along the back and a pair of smaller bands on each side of both trunk and tail . These are the muscles used in swimming . There are visceral muscles which move the jaws and other visceral arches . Small muscles are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or for slow movements . The internal organs do not show great deviation from the vertebrate type illustrated by the frog . The heart consists of a sinus venosus , which collects the venous blood , an atrium , a ventricle , and a cones arteriosus . As in the cyclostomes and sharks , only impure blood passes through the heart . There is a pancreas , but it is not typical , for it is scattered through the mesentery and can not be seen easily . The swim bladder of the perch has no connection with the pharynx . There is a single gonad , either ovary or testis , because of a fusion of the paired embryonic gonads . Protection among Fish . Life in the water is rugged and dangerous ; murder and starvation are found on every hand ; it seems as if every animal is trying to eat every other animal that is small enough to go in its mouth . Numerous methods of protection have evolved in fish for survival under such conditions . One of the most universal is protective coloration . Fish are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural environment . The dorsal surface is colored darker than the ventral surface . An enemy swimming over them 50111 ( 1 see them against the dark // caviar comes from the paddlefish , or spoonbilled catfish , a relative of the sturgeon which is common in the southern Mississippi River . At the other extreme are quite a number of ovoviviparous fish , such as our common fresh-water minnow , Gambusia . Like the sharks , this little fish retains the eggs in its body until they hatch , and the young are born alive so that they have a chance to swim away from their enemies from the first . The anal fin of the male is modified into a long slender tube which serves as a copulatory organ in transferring sperms to the female . A much smaller number of eggs is formed and there may be no more than a dozen young minnows produced at one reproductive cycle . The fresh-water catfish is somewhere in between . These fish scoop a nest out of the mud along the side of the river in which they live and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her way . The male will release sperms over the eggs and stay around waving his fins near them to keep a fresh current of water flowing over them so that they will receive plenty of oxygen . He will protect them with his life and , although the catfish is normally a rather sluggish animal , he is very active and aggressive if any other animal threatens injury to the eggs . When the young hatch he will stay with them for a time and he may even open his mouth so that the young can swim inside for safety when there is danger . This illustrates an interesting principle of fish reproduction . We are accustomed to thinking of care of the eggs and young as a maternal instinct , but in the fish it is the male that gives the care to the young if any is given . The female shows no further interest in the proceedings after she has laid her eggs . The sea horse is one of the strangest of a host of strange fish in respect to reproduction . The name is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five inches in length , but the head does somewhat resemble the head of a horse . The male sea horse has a brood pouch located on the ventral surface of the tail and , during the reproductive season , he will swim behind a female and , as she lays the eggs , he will catch them in this pouch . As he swims around in an upright position with his pouch distended with eggs , he looks very much like a pregnant animal about to give birth to offspring . It is sometimes said that this is the only species of animal in which the male becomes pregnant . When the eggs begin to hatch the male will hold onto a twig with his tail and appear to go through all the pangs of labor as he brings froth the living baby sea horses from his pouch . // The Pacific salmon has one of the most complicated reproductive cycles of them all . The adults are found in salt water , but they never reproduce there . When they are ready to reproduce , which is at about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fresh-water rivers that empty into the Pacific . They are one of the few fish that are able to make the transition from salt to fresh water without fatal reactions . They continue up the river until they reach shallow spring-fed streams far inland in which to spawn . The remarkable part about the whole process is that they return to the identical stream where they were hatched seven years previously . This can be determined by marking // the young salmon and checking their return . As they proceed up the river they come to many forks and turns , waterfalls and rapids , but nothing can stand in the way of their return to their place of origin . When we are returning from a drive in the country and forget whether to take the left hand or the right hand road when we just passed there a short time previously , we can appreciate the salmons ' problems in making their way back . During their journey upstream they take no food and their mouths become modified for digging their nests so that they could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breeding places they dig a nest over a spot where a spring is bubbling up through the gravel , for such a spot will not freeze during the severe winter which is found in northwestern United States , western Canada , and Alaska . The eggs are then laid and the sperms are released over them ; they are covered with gravel and the parents flounder around awhile in the shallow water and die . The wolves and vultures then have a feast , but the flesh is tough and stringy and not fit for human consumption after the long exhaustive journey which the salmon have made . They are caught in salt water for canning just before they enter the rivers or shortly after they enter . When the young hatch the following spring they slowly make their way downstream and reach the ocean about a year later . 21 . Chapter 26 Amphibia and Reptilia The Transition to Land Amphibians and Reptiles As WE LEARNED in the last chapter the first three classes of vertebrates are water animals . The transition to life on the land , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not accomplished completely in any one animal , but through a series of adaptations extending over two classes . These two classes of vertebrates will be studied in this chapter . CLASS AMPHIBIA This class includes the frogs , toads , and a few primitive , tropical , worm-like forms . The class name comes from Greek words meaning both forms of life , and animals of this group are given such a name because they really lead a double life ; they are both water and land animals . All the vertebrates studied up to this time have been water animals and the amphibians start their life as if they were going to keep up the tradition . They hatch out of the egg as fish-like animals with three fully developed and functional gills which are used for respiration . After a time , however , certain changes occur which transform them into animals adapted to live on the land . The gills gradually disappear and lungs appear , small limb buds appear which grow into legs , and a neck appears to give the head movement independent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the land and take their place as terrestrial vertebrates . Some of them have made quite a success of their life on land , while others seem to have found this life too rigorous and have crawled back in the water to spend the greater part of their time there , even though they must come to the surface to breathe . A few of these do not give tip their larval gills and use hotly gill and lung respiration . 418 // In making the transition to land , however , the amphibians have retained some of the methods of living characteristic of aquatic animals . Although some of them are capable of living on the land far from the water , when the time comes for reproduction they must return to their ancestral home in the water to accomplish this vital function . There are two reasons for this . First , the male has no copulatory organ to be used for the transference of sperms into the body of the female , as do most and vertebrates . Second , the amphibians have an egg which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow on the land , an egg must have ai thick , protective shell , and the embryo must develop special membranes - inside the shell to take care of respiration . Since the amphibian egg has neither , it must develop in the water . Amphibian eggs are surrounded by a mass of transparent jelly which protects them to some extent in the water , but it dries up quickly on the land . There is one group of amphibians which retain the tail as an adult . These are commonly called the salamanders or newts . Some of these live almost entirely in the water and may keep their gills throughout life , but they also develop lungs and use both gill and lung respiration . Others live mostly on the land , but are not as well adapted to life on the land as the toads and they must crawl under rocks and logs during the daytime to prevent their skin from drying . The common mud puppy ( Necturus maculosus ) is a large river salamander which retains its gills throughout life . Since it is found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer , this is a useful adaptation . It is a fearsome-looking creature , and many fishermen think that it is deadly poisonous . Many will not touch one if they happen to catch one on their line . Actually , it has teeth so tiny that it is incapable of inflicting a bite that will break the skin on man . Mud puppies are regularly dissected in courses in comparative anatomy and , for this reason , the demand for them is very great . The mud eel ( Siren ) is another interesting salamander which keeps its gills throughout life . It has a long , slender , eel-like body with tiny front legs , but no hind legs . It is nearly helpless on land , but in the water it can swim with undulating movements of the body with the front legs folded back against the body . At rest , however , the front legs help this peculiar salamander to keep upright and to walk around slowly . Evidently , in the distant past a mutation or series of mutations of the genes resulted in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well , or perhaps ( Well better , without them , and this characteristic be- came established in the species . Hind legs might interfere with the smoothness of the body when the mud eel was trying to escape from an enemy . The Colorado axolotl is a very interesting species which is found abundantly in the mountain streams of Colorado . Like all amphibians. // the larvae - have gills . There is no metamorphosis , however , and the gills are retained throughout life . It is sometimes said that they remain larvae in general body structure , but become sexually mature . In other regions there is a tiger salamander ( Ambystoma tigrinum ) which looks just lik he Colorado axolotl as larvae , but they undergo metamorphosis and because spotted adults without gills . When some of the Colorado axolotls e taken east they soon changed color , lost their gills , and crawled , of the aquarium as typical tiger salamanders . It was discovered that absence of iodine in the water of the mountain streams was the cause of the failure of the axolotl to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water of an aquarium or , better still , the feeding of fresh thyroid glands to the axolotls causes them to become land salamanders even though they stay in Colorado . Strange to say , salamanders have internal fertilization even though they have no organs for copulation . The male and female first go through a courtship " dance " in the water , then the male deposits packets of sperms ( spermatophores ) on leaves or other objects in the bottom of the pond . The female comes along behind him and picks then1 up with the lips of her cloaca . The sperms are stored in special climatic periods the reptiles could dominate the mammals , but as the weather got cool small aggressive mammals could easily overcome the larger and stronger reptiles and exterminate many of them . Turtles . These reptiles have traded activity for protection . They are slow and awkward , but so well protected by their outer " shell " that they have been able to survive while their more active relatives became extinct . Although amphibians typically have a smooth skin , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reptiles some of the scales have become greatly enlarged , thickened , and fused together to form the " shell . " In many turtles this is hinged so that the head and legs may be drawn inside and the " shell " tightly closed . Land turtles are usually referred to as tortoises , while the name turtle is commonly used when referring to those that live primarily in the water . Turtles hold thy ? world 's record for holding their breath under water , for they have been known to stay submerged for as long as three hours without cooling up for air . On the Galapagos Islands there are huge tortoises weighing several // hundred pounds and estimated to be up to four hundred years old . They are pr bly the oldest living animals on the earth . ANatoMY OF THE TURTLE . The turtle is covered externally by a pair of " she which protect most of the soft parts of the body . The dorsal shell , the carapace , and the ventral shell , the plastron , are connected on the sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double layer ? an inner one of bone and an outer horny epidermal layer . Even the skin is dry and waterproof , unlike the skin of the amphibia . The vertebral column is fused to the carapace , except the neck and tail bones . The cervical vertebrae are in the neck and allow extensive movements of the head . The body vertebrae are fused to the shell , the top of the neural arch spreads out forming a large neural plate , and the ribs join with the carapace to form a large costal plate . The caudal vertebrae are free . The sternum is fused to the plastron . The head contains a pair of eyes with movable eyelids which close the eyes . A large tympanic membrane back of the eyes receives sound waves and carries them to the internal ear by means of an ear bone , the columella . A Eustachian tube connects the middle ear with the pharynx . There are no teeth in the mouth ? the jaws are encased with a horny beak which is used to bite . The internal organs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // DIGESTIVE SYSTEM . In the roof of the mouth are two slits , the posterior pares . A thick fleshy tongue lies on the floor of the mouth . Behind the mouth is a small pharynx which lacks gill slits . Behind the tongue there is an elongated slit , the glottis , which leads to the lungs . On the roof of the pharynx there is a pair of openings for the Eustachian tubes , which lead to the middle ears . These are vestiges of the first pair of gill pouches . The esophagus opens at the posterior end of the pharynx and passes down the neck to the stomach . From the stomach the much coiled small intestine leads to a short large intestine which connects With the cloaca . The pancreas is easily seen iii the coils of the small intestine . // The liver has a gallbladder which is connected to the anterior part of the small intestine , the duodenum , by a bile duct . CIRCULATORY SYSTEM . The heart consists of two atria and a partly divided ventricle which allows the pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the alligator the partition between the ventricles is complete and this makes a four-chambered heart . There is a welldeveloped renal portal system carrying venous blood to the kidneys . An inferior vena cava and two anterior venae cavae return the blood to the sinus venosus which connects with the right atrium . Both the right half and the left half of the fourth aortic arch connect to form the dorsal aorta . The third aortic arch forms the base of the carotid artery and the sixth aortic arches form the pulmonary arteries which go to the lungs . The oxygenated blood is returned by the pulmonary veins to the left atrium and thence to the left side of the ventricle through the atrioventricular opening . RESPIRATORY SYSTEM . Air enters the turtle through the external nares at the anterior , dorsal portion of the head and passes into the mouth and pharynx . It then passes through the glottis into the trachea which branches into two bronchi ? one going to each lung . Turtle lungs have more divisions than those of the frog , and thus the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigid shell of the turtle makes it impossible for it to use chest expansion for inspiration , as other reptiles do . Instead , there are special muscles for this purpose . There are two flank muscles which enlarge the coelom and thus cause the air to be drawn into the lungs . Expiration is accomplished by reducing the size of the coelom through the use of expiratory muscles . NERVOUS SYSTEM . The brain is better developed than in the frog . The cerebral hemispheres are larger and there is a separation into an outer gray matter and an inner white matter . The cerebellum is also large , an indication of an improved power of coordination . As in all land vertebrates , there are twelve cranial nerves . UROGENITAL SYSTEM . There are two kidneys ( of the metanephric type ) which are connected with the cloaca by the ureters . Urine is stored in the bilobed urinary bladder which connects with the cloaca . In the male there are two rounded testes , each of which connects with a coiled epididymis , and this connects with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penis lies on the ventral floor of the cloaca . It consists of an expanded tip , the glans , and two folds of tissue , the corpora cavcrnosa , with a urethral groove between them . Sperms pass // down this groove during copulation . The ovaries of the female are large compound structures supported at the anterior end . Posteriorly they open into the cloaca through large genital pores . The female has a clitoris on the floor of the cloaca . It is similar to the male penis although smaller . Fertilization takes place // internally before the shell is put on the eggs . Eggs are laid in warm sand in a nest which the female scoops out with her hind legs . Crocodiles and Alligators . These are the giants of the living reptiles ; CM // they frequently grow to a length of twenty feet and have actually been measured thirty feet long . Their huge bodies , armed with powerful jaws lined with sharp teeth , make the crocodiles antagonists to be respected by any living creature . They are always found in or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen sleeping on the bank of a tropical river , but on being disturbed they plunge into the water where they are undisputed masters . At other times they float lazily near the surface , with just their nostrils , eyes , and the upper parts of their heads above the water . In this position they look very much like floating logs . There are only slight differences in the crocodiles and alligators , but the crocodile seems to be the more vicious and aggressive of the two . Fortunately , the alligator is the one most abundant in the coastal regions of the southern states , although there is one species of crocodile in Florida . The crocodiles infest rivers and lakes in tropical regions all over the world and are especially abundant in the rivers of Africa . Lizards . The lizards are an extremely varied group of reptiles adapted to a wide range of environments . They range from tiny wormlike burrowing forms to those more than twelve feet long with long sharp claws , able to tear their prey apart like a tiger . Some are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dry , sandy deserts ; but some are found in moist forests and some even swim in the water . Some move so swiftly that they look like a streak to the eye ; others move so slowly that they seem to be in slow-motion movies . Some have welldeveloped limbs ; some have none at all and may be mistaken for snakes . i // Many lizards , at one time or another , have been accused of being poisonous , but there is only one species in the United States that deserves this accusation . This is the Gila monster ; it is a clumsy , thickhoed lizard with a heavy tail that serves as a food reservoir to tide it periods of food scarcity . It is found primarily in Arizona and is especially abundant along the Gila River . It moves awkwardly but , when olested , is capable of quick movements of the head accompanied with a snapping of the jaws which may easily fasten onto a hand held too near . Gila monsters have grooved teeth with poison glands at their base and once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , chewing a little to work the poison down into the wound . The bite makes a person quite ill , but the poison does not seem to be injected in sufficient quantities to cause death . The horned lizard of Texas and other southwestern states would look like some prehistoric monster if it were much larger . It has a broad flattened body resembling that of a toad and is often called a horned toad . When disturbed it may shoot a fine stream of blood out of its eyes for a distance of several feet . This does not seem to accomplish any particular purpose except that it might startle an attacker and give the lizard it chance to escape . // The American chameleon ( Anolis carolinensis ) is very common in the southeastern United States . It is another one of the animals that can alter their color . It has a basal pigment of green in the skin , but over this there are chromatophores of brown which are capable of expansion and contraction . When they are expanded they mask the green and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these bodies are contracted . The color changes come about in response to a hormone from the intermediate lobe of the pituitary gland . When this gland is removed the chameleons remain green ? the hormone is necessary for the expansion of the brown chromatophores . It is commonly believed that these animals will change color to match the color of the object upon which they are resting , but experiments show that this is not true . They frequently stay brown when placed on a green background and vice versa . However , they will respond to the color of light which strikes them . In their natural surroundings these chameleons will be green when light filters down through green foliage , but when they crawl out under the open // sky , ey may turn brown even though they are resting on a green leaf . During reeding , feeding , and other forms of excitement they are nearly always green . The males sometimes puff out their throat , which is a beautift shade of pink when thus extended . The glass snake is worthy of mention because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become unjointed in times of danger , only to reassemble themselves and crawl away whole when the Photos b danger is past . This is not a snake at all , but a legless lizard . Like many lizards it is able to throw off a part of its tail when greatly excited . This is a protective measure ; if it is being pursued by an enemy the tail will most likely be caught first . The tail may be broken off and the main part of the lizard escapes while its enemy is satisfied with the tail . If the tail is thrown off ( hiring the chase , it will attract the enemy because it will wiggle actively for a time after being thrown off . The glass snake often does this , and the rest of the superstition was pieced together // from this one fact . A new tail will be regenerated , but it will require several months to be completed . Snakes . There is probably no single group of animals on the earth more feared than the snakes , yet an objective study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a bad reputation . The fear is not inborn , as some think , for a child will not show this unnatural fear unless he sees such reactions among his elders and hears the many wild superstitions that some people seem to take delight in repeating . As a whole , snakes are highly beneficial to mankind , for they destroy great numbers of rodents , which are among our worst enemies . A farmer who wantonly chops the heads off the snakes that he finds on his farm is doing himself great harm , for the rodents which these snakes would have eaten will do great damage to his crops and stored grain . Some wise farmers collect large hull snakes and turn them loose in the barn to keep down the rodent population . Unfortunately , there are some snakes that have fangs connected to poison sacs and are capable of inflicting a poisonous bite , which in some cases may be venomous enough to cause the death of a human being . In spite of whatever benefit they might be otherwise , such snakes are undesirable members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas of human population . However , they make up only a small proportion of the total number of snakes in the world , and it is certainly not fair to condemn an entire group of animals just because there are some undesirables in their midst . It is much more sensible to learn // which are not desired and destroy those and preserve the others which are ue . It is easy to learn the poisonous snakes in the United States , for there are only r types that can bite a person , and these have easily recognized characteristics . Three of them are pit vipers which take their name from the pit which lies just anterior and ventral to the eye . Also , the pupil of the eye is slit-like , like the pupil of a cat 's eye , rather than round , like that found in the other families of snakes . Some readers are perhaps thinking that it does no good to know what kind of eye the pit vipers have because they are not going to get close enough to see pupils anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to see the pupil clearly , for the snakes will not attack a person and they can strike no farther than half their body length . The third characteristic of the pit vipers is the arrow-shaped head , caused by an enlargement of the head at its junction with the neck . Other snakes may show this character to some extent , but it is quite distinctive in the pit vipers . Individual characteristics of the pit vipers found in the United States are as follows . The rattlesnakes are by far the most abundant and important of the poisonous snakes in the United States . They are nervous , temperamental snakes that are quick to strike and carry a very potent poison . These snakes are best known by the rattle , which consists of a series of rings of dried skin on the tip of the tail . When a person gets excited and nervous his hands often tremble ; snakes do not have any hands , so their tails tremble when they are excited . When the tail trembles at high speed the rattle makes a characteristic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been heard . When the skin is shed a ring of the posterior part of it is left behind to form a ring of the rattle . It is sometimes said that a rattlesnake 's age can be told by the number of rings on the rattle . This is not accurate , for the snake may shed its skin from one to three times a year and the rings are sometimes broken off . Another superstition holds that rattlesnakes always rattle before striking . They rattle when they get excited but if you suddenly step on one that may be sleeping it will strike immediately without waiting to rattle . The fangs are long and curved and fold back against the roof of the mouth in a sheath of skin when not in use . When danger threatens the snake will probably try to get away first , but if pressed closely will pull itself into loose loops facing its foe ready to strike . As the snake strikes , the lower jaw is dropped down , the fangs become erect , and the head hits with enough force to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they enter , the poison sacs contract and inject the poison and the snake jerks its head back ready to strike again . All of this takes place with lightning-like rapidity . The poison is a blood poison and begins destruction of the elements of the blood . When properly treated , most cases of poisonous snake bite recover . The rattlesnakes account for about 90 per cent of the deaths from snake bite in the United States . There are about fifteen species of rattlesnakes in the United States . There are some , such as the little pigmy rattlesnake , or ground rattlesnake , that have only a single button on the tip of the tail , and this does // not rattle . The eastern diamondback rattlesnake grows to the greatest th , sometimes seven feet . The Texas diamondback rattlesnake is a large member of this group . The cottonmouth water moccasin is a dangerous and feared snake of the swamps and bayous of the southern states . It has the pit viper characteristics and can also be recognized by its dull , irregular , olive-brown color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in and around water at all times and , like the rattlesnake , they prefer to escape danger rather than face it . When approached they may be seen to slip silently into the water and swim away , but when cornered they are quite vicious and there are some deaths from the bite . The copperhead is the third and final member of the pit viper family in the United States . It is a smaller snake than the other two and has a much better disposition . In fact it is so gentle that it seldom bites unless it is stepped on , and it certainly can not be blamed for that . Copperheads have pretty copper-colored bands of irregular shape on their slender , graceful bodies that make them beautiful snakes . They are not more than three feet long and do not seem to inject enough poison to cause death in a normal , healthy person , but it is enough to make a person quite sick , so first-aid treatment should be given following their bite . Another very beautiful snake , the coral , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . It is not a pit viper ; it has a round pupil , there is no pit , and the head is not puffed out where it joins the body . However , it can easily be recognized by the glossy red and // black bands , bordered by smaller yellow bands , that run around the body . Corals are very gentle snakes , like the copperheads , and the author knows of two cases where they were mistaken for the harmless king snake and were picked up and handled for quite some time before the handlers realized they were dealing with a poisonous snake . Nearly all bites are received when it is stepped on . The coral is a member of the cobra family and this family has short erect fangs , rather than the long retractible fangs like the pit vipers . Therefore , it does not strike , but actually grabs the skin with its mouth and forces the fangs through the skin with a biting motion . Ordinary trousers seem sufficiently thick to protect the legs from its bite . The coral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , and does not inject enough poison to cause death in most cases . It has a nerve poison that works differently from the pit viper poison that destroys the blood . A person that is bitten may go blind temporarily and have difficulty in breathing and carrying out the other body activities controlled by the nerves . Death from snake bite in the United States is very low , only twenty to thirty per year ? almost nothing in comparison with the forty to fifty thousand that die from automobile accidents ; but in tropical countries deaths are much more frequent . There are many thousands of deaths in India from the bite of the hooded cobra . This interesting snake , when alert , spreads the ribs at the anterior part of the body to form the // hood . It often goes into houses in search of mice , and many people are bitten in their own homes . Unfortunately , the majority of the people hold them in superstitious reverence and will not kill one for fear that it may be the reincarnation of their late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet long , but it has the short erect fangs characteristic of the family and has to chew the fangs into the skin . Ordinary clothing would be a great protection from it , but the natives usually go around barelegged and barefooted . The king cobra of Africa and parts of Asia stands supreme among the poisonous snakes of the world . It grows to a length of twelve feet and has venom able to cause death in a few minutes . When disturbed it does not show the nervous , threshing movements of many other snakes , but gracefully raises its head , spreads its hood , and may approach the intruder weaving from side to side ready to strike . Africa is also noted for the spitting cobra that is able to spit its venom six or eight feet . It instinctively aims for the eyes and temporary blindness will result if even a small quantity of the poison reaches them . Another member of the cobra family is the asp , which is well known because Cleopatra pressed an asp to her bosom to commit suicide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arc the bushmaster and the fer de lance , both pit vipers with ver.y bad reputations , which are well deserved . While we are on the subject of foreign snakes we might mention those // of the boa family , which are well known because of the great size of some of them . Fortunately , they are not venomous . They are constricting snakes , which have a habit of wrapping themselves around their prey and squeezing it to death before swallowing it . A snake swallowing its prey is a very interesting sight . It can swallow animals with a body diameter at least three times its own body diameter . A python can swallow a large pig or antelope . After squeezing the animal to death , the snake grasps one end is gradually forced into the throat . Once through the throat , powerful peristaltic movements of the esophagus help pull the animal down . After finishing a meal , there will be a huge lump in the python 's body , which will gradually diminish as the animal is digested . Huge pythons have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aversion to clothed persons . The tales of explorers being squeezed to death by pythons or boa constrictors are probably just more of the many snake tales without foundation in fact . The boa family includes many smaller snakes and the following giants . The regal python , of Indochina , Burma , and the Malay Peninsula , which reaches the great length of thirty feet and a weight of 225 pounds . The African python , which grows as long as twenty feet . The anaconda , or water boa , of South America , which also groves to twenty feet or a little moer in length . // To get back to the snakes of the United States , we shall list some of the common nonpoisonous ones with some of their characteristics and habits . The most abundant of all the snakes in the United States are the striped snakes that have one or several longitudinal stripes running the length of the back . They are commonly called ribbon snakes and garter snakes , and may be found in the back yards of city dwellers as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as earthworms , frogs , and toads . Small ones are often carried by boys to frighten girls who " just ca n't stand the sight of wriggling snakes . " The water snakes live in and around water and eat fish , frogs , and toads . They are almost invariably called water moccasins by those who think that any snake around the water is a water moccasin . They are somewhat ill-tempered and able to give a painful bite , but carry no poison . ' I'lic king snakes area highly beneficial group because of the large numbers of rodents that they destroy . They also eat other snakes and semi especially fond of poisonous ones such as rattlesnakes . The king // grabs its victim , quickly coils about him , and squeezes him to death . Sometimes the king is bitten during the battle , but he is immune to the poison and suffers no harm . The rattlesnake may then be eaten . King snakes are very gentle toward man and make nice pets that are entirely safe to handle ; they can hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroys our most deadly reptiles without hesitation . Probably the most interesting of our snakes is the hognosed snake , also called the spreading adder or blowing viper . If a person suddenly comes upon one it will rear up and spread the skin back of its head , which makes it look like a hooded cobra . It blows itself up to more than twice its ordinary size and then forces air out of its mouth to produce a hissing noise . It feints as if about to strike . Because of this fierce behavior , most people think it is a deadly reptile ; even its breath is supposed to be poisonous . However , this is all a bluff , for the hognosed snake will make no attempt to bite even if one slaps it in the face . When its bluff does not work , it may " play dead . " It will roll over on its back , open its mouth wide , writhe in the most realistic death agonies , and then lie perfectly still . It can then be handled without showing any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the right side up , it will give itself away by rolling over on its back . It seems to know instinctively that , in order to look dead , an animal should be on its back . The hognosed snake makes a nice pet and becomes very gentle after being handled a short time . The chicken snake is a member of a group called rat snakes . These are all great destroyers of rodents . Chicken snakes will come around barns and chicken houses in search of rodents and sometimes eat eggs and young chickens . They do more good than harm , but farmers , seeing only the poultry loss , usually dislike them very much . The racers are a group of slender , nervous snakes that move quite rapidly . The black snake and the blue racer are common examples . It would not be fair to conclude a discussion of snakes without mentioning snake superstitions . These are so numerous that it will be impossible to mention them all , but some of those that are widely told will be discussed . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to death . " There is a coachwhip snake ; it is one of the racers and the color of the long slender body and the arrangement of the scales make it look like a plaited leather whip . If one were stepped on , it might thresh // around and strike a person 's legs with its tail , but that is as far as the truth of this superstition goes . The snake is entirely harmless , but is too nervous to tame easily . " A hoop snake will put its tail in its mouth and roll down a hill like a hoop in pursuit of a man . When it nears the man it straightens out and pierces him with a sting on the end of its tail that causes death . " There is a hoop snake , more commonly called the indigo snake , which grows to a length of nine feet and is our largest snake in the United States . It is a beautiful shining blue-black color and seems to greatly enjoy being handled by man . It is a favorite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows , because it is so large and yet so gentle toward people . This snake never rolls like a hoop and no snake has anything like a sting in its tail . " Some snakes will milk cows . " Farmers sometimes accuse snakes of stealing the milk when a cow does not give as much milk as he thinks it should . No snakes are known that will take food in a liquid form and none have ever been observed milking a cow . " Snakes ca n't bite under water . " Snakes can and do bite under water ; they do not strangle when they open their mouths under water . They prefer to escape , however , and if a snake knows you are coming , it will go in the other direction . It is just as anxious to avoid contact with a person as a person is to avoid contact with it . " Snakes are cold and slimy . " Snakes are cold-blooded animals ; which means that their body temperature is about the same as the temperature of their surroundings . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface . They are clean and dry unless they have just been in the water and are never slimy . " If you are sleeping out on the plains put a grass rope around you , for if a rattlesnake starts to cross the rope , it will tickle his belly and he will turn back . " Not true ; rattlesnakes will readily cross any kind of rope . " If a poisonous snake bites you kill a chicken and press the flesh against the bite . This will draw the poison out . " Of all the snake superstitions , those concerning treatment of snake bite are the most vicious , for a person may rely on such tales and die as a result . This chicken superstition is absolutely false , as are many others concerning the use of tobacco juice and whiskey . The generally accepted first-aid treatment of snake bite is as follows . First , apply a moderately tight tourniquet about two inches above the // bite if the bite is on an area of the body where this can be done . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movement of lymph and not blood . Then two incisions should be made through the fang marks and suction applied to remove as much lymph and body fluids as possible . Every fifteen minutes the tourniquet should be loosened and moved back up the limb an inch or two . As the skin puffs up farther from the bite , additional cuts should be made and more suction cups applied . The victim should be kept as quiet as possible so that his muscular movements will not push the lymph on into the blood system , since most of the poison in the tissues is picked up by the lymph system . In the absence of snake kits containing suction cups , it is generally considered safe to suck the poison out with the mouth . Even though some of it should be swallowed , the pit viper venom is destroyed by the digestive juices . A small amount of the poison might be ab- // sorbed , however , if there are cuts or sores on the mouth . As soon as possible antivenin should be injected . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor 's office . Today there is a snake kit which contains a powdered form which consists of a mixture of the antivenins for the chief kinds of pit vipers in the United States . This powder can be dissolved in distilled water and injected immediately in the field . Unlike the liquid preparations , this powder does not need to be refrigerated . Even though the patient appears to be getting along very well , he should be taken to a physician as soon as possible . Blood transfusions may be necessary because of the destruction of the blood by the poison . " Snake charmers can charm snakes . " There is a common belief that some persons have some special gift by means of which they can charm snakes and handle dangerous specimens without danger to themselves . In some cases they use music supposedly to effect the charm . There can be no charming of snakes , although it is possible for persons to study the habits of snakes and do things with them that seem very dangerous to a person who thinks of all snakes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side show usually handles only harmless snakes that any person in the audience could handle just as safely . " If you pull a snake 's fangs out it will be harmless . " This is another one of those vicious superstitions , for a person can lose his life if he depends on its veracity . The snakes with the long curved fangs have a succession of them under the mucous membranes ready to descend into place if one of the functional fangs is lost . Sometimes their fangs break off in nature , but they are replaced within a few days . Chapter 2 7 Class Ayes The Birds THE BIRDS are a very important class of vertebrates so far as man is concerned . They have a great aesthetic appeal because of their beautiful colorations and their pleasing songs . They also furnish an important source of food for man . Some have been domesticated and so selected that they lay many more eggs than would be normal in a natural environment where eggs are used solely for reproduction . Game birds challenge many sportsmen who seek recreation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group because of their feeding habits . They destroy many harmful insects and rodents , and it would be difficult for man to grow many crops without this assistance . Some birds are scavengers and are valuable in the elimination of dead animals . The vultures or buzzards glide high in the air . Their keen eyesight enables them to see dead animals on the ground , and as they circle down to feed , others in the vicinity note the action and join in the descent . Soon there will be dozens of these birds , and it requires only a short time for them to pick the flesh from a dead animal . In some sections of the world , birds furnish a valuable source of fertilizer . The islands which lie off the coast of Peru are outstanding in this regard . Millions of birds , such as cormorants , boobies , and pelicans , congregate on these islands ; in fact , the islands are literally covered with birds when they come in to roost for the night . They deposit an enormous amount of fecal material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate . This forms a rich natural fertilizer known as guano . The birds deposit as much as 750 tons per acre per year . One might wonder how these birds can obtain sufficient food to supply such a horde , but the deep , cold waters surrounding the islands abound in fish life which makes food getting easy . Of course , birds have some activities which are not beneficial and may be economically harmful . Some eat grain or the tender shoots of growing plants . Some hawks catch chickens , although the great ma-448 // of their fecal deposits . Many a statue in a public place is marred by the wastes from birds which find the statues a convenient perching place . As a whole , however , birds are beneficial and need protection in many cases . Excessive clearing of the land removes the trees and protected places where they might nest . Reforestation and protection of existing forested regions help protect birds . The extensive use of insecticides in some regions has created a problem . Some birds have been poisoned by eating insects that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most distinctive characteristics of birds . There are some flightless birds , such as the ostrich and the penguins , but the great majority fly and have many body adaptations which make them more efficient in this activity . Careful observation of birds in flight shows how the wings function . On the upbeat the wings are partially folded and the feathers are so turned that they resemble the open slats of a Venetian blind , thus offering little air resistance . The feathers are closed again on the downbeat and the air resistance maintains the proper altitude . Forward movement is obtained by a propeller-like action of the terminal portion of the wings . Some birds , such as the vultures , appear to fly without flapping their wings . Such birds are experts in the art of gliding and soaring and take advantage of all of the updrafts of air currents to maintain their position in the air . A bird 's speed of flight varies considerably ; most travel at from 20 to 40 miles per hour when in full flight , but some are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swift has been clocked at nearly 200 miles per hour , duck hawks reach speeds up to 180 miles per hour when in a dive , and some ducks can go as fast as 90 miles per hour . The body shape of birds is generally streamlined in such a way as to offer the least resistance to the air . We have learned much about the design of airplanes through a study of the shape of the bird 's body . Feathers are a distinguishing feature of birds . All birds have feathers and no animals except birds have feathers . The birds appear to have a reptilian origin and the scales typical of the reptiles are present on the legs , but on other parts of the body the outgrowths from the skin are in the form of feathers . These are of three types . ' The contour feathers are those which have a central shaft with parallel barbs to the sides . These give shape and protection to the body and those on the // wines offer resistance to the air in flying . Those on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight and also can be spread and sery s a brake to slow the speed of flight . Down feathers consist of a central shaft with barbs coming out irregularly . These function primarily to conserve body warmth and are very efficient in this regard . We take advantage of this and use the down for making quilts which are very light , but have great heat-holding qualities . The best quality of down comes from the eider duck . This bird plucks down from its body and uses it to line the nest , and it can be collected from the nests . Some feathers may be a mixture ? down near the body and contour on the outside . The third type of feathers are filoplumes which are little hair-like projections with tufts on the end . They seem to have no particular function . The feathers of birds are borne on certain regions of the skin known as feather tracts . The feathers are shed in the process known as molting , which takes place in the late summer as a rule , and are replaced by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , and the bird is never " naked " ( without feathers ) . Birds are warm-blooded . This means that the body maintains a constant high temperature regardless of surrounding temperature fluctuations . Cold-blooded animals , on the other hand , have a body tentperature which fluctuates rather widely in accord with variations in the temperature of their surroundings . The food requirements of a warmDistinctive // d animal are generally much greater than those of a cold-blooded animal because much of the food is used in the process of metabolism which produces the heat necessary to maintain the body temperature at a high level . Compare the almost constant search for food which characterizes most birds with the much more limited food intake of the reptiles and this distinction is quite clear . A pet snake may require feeding no more often than twice a month , but a pet bird requires daily feedings in considerable quantity relative to its small size . The body temperature of birds is higher than that of man ; it may range from about 105 ? to 111 ? F. A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hibernation during cold weather and the body temperature drops , but most maintain the constant high temperature , even those that remain in cold regions during the winter . The hummingbird is interesting in this regard . It is very small and therefore has a very high proportion of body surface in relation to its body volume . This is conducive to a great loss of heat through radiation from the skin . It can be calculated by the laws of physics that it is impossible for the hummingbird to live through the night without feeding , yet we know that it does . This is possible because of a nightly hibernation . The body temperature begins to drop when the bird comes to rest for the night and throughout the night there is not the high rate of food consumption in metabolism that would be necessary to maintain the constant high temperatures found during the day . The songs and calls of birds are distinctive ; they are produced in a way not found in any other group of animals . There is a special organ , known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trachea and the bronchial tubes in the chest . There is no homologous organ in other animals . This is used to produce call notes and songs which are for communication with one another . There are calls of warning , recognition , distress , hunger , etc . Songs are of a longer duration and generally produced only by the males during the breeding season . The calls and songs are so distinctive that species of birds can be identified by them . Some birds , such as the mockingbirds , can mimic the songs and calls of other species and some , such as the mynas , parakeets , crows , and parrots , can mimic human speech rather accurately . Other distinctive characteristics of birds will be brought out as we survey the body structure . // BODY STRUCTURE The Skeleton and Muscles . The bird skeleton shows many adaptations to flying . The bones are very light because of numerous air cavities within them , yet they are so designed that a maximum of strength is obtained for the weight . The frigate bird has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only four ounces . In most birds the sternum ( breast bone ) is enlarged and projects ventrally in a keel . This is an accommodation for the attachment of the large . breast muscles which function in the downbeat of the wings . The clavicles ( collar bones ) are fused at one end and form the familiar wishbone . The skull // has a large brain case and very large orbits for the eyes . The facial bones extend forward and form the bill , which has many uses for the bird . There are no teeth in modern birds . This is also an adaptation which brings about weight reduction . Teeth must be rather heavy , and there must be strong jaw bones and muscles to use the teeth . The cervical vertebrae are long and have an articulation which permits free movement in all directions . The thoracic vertebrae and the ribs are connected with bony processes which provide the rigid thoracic cage necessary for the flying mechanism . The pelvic girdle is open on the ventral surface , an accommodation for egg laying , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sacral vertebrae to give a rigid support to the back . There are four free caudal vertebrae and five or six fused together to form the pygostyle which serves to move the tail feathers . The bones of the pectoral appendage are modified as a support for the wings ; only three digits can he observed ( numbers 2 , 3 , and 4 ) and of these only number 3 is well developed . There is a fusion of some of the carpal and metacarpal bones , forming a carpometacarpus . The pelvic appendages show a fusion of some of the tarsal bones with the tibia to give the tibiotarsus , and some are fused with the metacarpals to give the tarsometatarsus . Four digits form the claws ( number 5 is missing ) . The muscles of the neck , tail , wings , and legs are well developed . The pectoralis major , which occupies the space on either side of the sternum and pulls the wings on the downbeat , weighs about a fifth as much as the entire body . When all of the guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be thankful for this fact . How can a bird sleep and still maintain its position on a tree branch which is swaying in the wind ? This puzzling question has its answer in a special perching adaptation which is found in all of the perching birds . The tendons of the leg which are attached to the claws are pulled when the legs are bent and this closes the claws . Thus , the weight of the bird 's body on the bent legs keeps the claws tightly gripped on the limb without need for any muscle contraction . The Nervous System . The brain of a bird is proportionately larger than that of the reptiles . This is due mainly to an increased size of the cerebellum , the part of the brain associated with the many activities of ' muscle coordination . This is another adaptation for flying . Watch a bird flying toward a cliff at high speed . It may seem as if he surely is going to dash himself to pieces against it , but at the last moment he // throws his wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead stop and settles on a slight projection . This requires a high degree of coordination which is made possible by the large cerebellum with its many folds . The olfactory lobes of the brain are poorly developed and birds are known to have a very poor sense of smell . A hungry buzzard can be placed near a dead animal that has a very strong odor of decomposition , yet the animal will not be detected if the buzzard can not see it . On the other hand , the sense of sight is extremely keen in birds , as evidenced by the highly developed optic lobes of the brain . A buzzard at a thousand feet in the air can detect a dead squirrel on the ground even though it is partially sheltered by trees . The eyes are very large ; some hawks have eyes as large as human eyes . Thus , a great proportion of the head is occupied by the eyes . The retina of a bird is about twice as thick as that of a man and in hawks , noted for the keenness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,000,000 rods and cones per square millimeter . This gives them a visual acuity about eight times that of man . Accommodation , or focusing , is rapid and very efficient . It is accomplished by changes in the shape of the cornea as well as the lens . Birds can also adjust rapidly to changes in light intensity . A flashlight can be passed back and forth across the eyes of an owl in the dark and the pupils will dilate and constrict as fast as the light moves . In man , several minutes are required to achieve adjustment to sudden changes in light intensity . Birds have a functional third eyelid , the nictitating membrane which can move across and cover the eye when the eyelids are open . This can clear the vision in rain or fog and has been compared to a windshield wiper . Man has a small vestige of this membrane in the medial corner of each eye , but it is not functional . The sense of taste in birds is poorly developed , probably correlated with the fact that they swallow their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , is highly developed , a fact which is correlated with their calls and songs . There is an external tympanic membrane which picks up vibrations and a single ear bone , columella , carries them to the inner ear . The Digestive System . Birds tend to swallow their food in large pieces ? in the absence of teeth there can be no chewing , although they can use the bill and claws to break large pieces of food down into smaller pieces . It passes from the mouth , down the short pharynx , through the muscular esophagus and into the soft-walled crop . This is a chamber where the food is stored and moistened . After heavy feeding this crop // may bulge out from the anterior chest region and one can feel the food inside by touching the skin in this area . The food passes from the crop into the stomach , which consists of two parts . Anteriorly there is the proventriculus , which is soft and secretes gastric juice . Then , there is the ventriculus , or gizzard , which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretion . Here the food is ground up by the contractions of this organ . The birds swallow gravel or similar hard objects which serve as an aid in the grinding process . The food then . passes into the intestine , which is slender and greatly coiled , and this enlarges into the rectum . The rectum empties into the cloaca . The liver and pancreas are similar to those found in amphibians and reptiles . The Respiratory System . The most distinctive feature of the bird respiratory system is the presence of air sacs that extend out from the lungs into spaces in the body cavity and even into cavities in the humeral bones . These permit a very efficient method of respiration when a bird is in flight . The air sacs are compressed when the muscles contract and expand when the muscles relax . This causes a complete ventilation of the lungs and consequently a more efficient oxygen absorption . // In other vertebrates only a small proportion of the air in the lungs is changed with each breath . The air sacs are also important in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no sweat glands , but the circulation of outside air through the air sacs can carry off excess heat from the interior of the body . When the bird is not flying , he uses chest expansion as a means of inhalation . The syrinx as an organ of sound production has already been mentioned . The sound results from vibrating membranes on the sides of the syrinx . Air sacs from the lungs press against these membranes from the outside , and as the air currents rush through the organ these membranes are pushed outward . They are pushed back again , however , by the pressure generated in the air sacs and this sets the membranes into vibration . By changing the tension on the membranes the pitch can be changed . The Circulatory System . The high energy requirements of birds necessitate a very efficient circulatory system . The heart is large and contains four complete chambers similar to the mammalian heart . This is more efficient than the three-chambered heart which allows some mixing of oxygenated and unoxygenated blood . The arteries which lead to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat is incredibly rapid by human standards . An excited canary will have a rate of about 1000 beats per minute , while the domestic fowl ( chicken ) has a rate of about 300 . The red blood cells are nucleated as in all other vertebrates except mammals . Excretory System . The kidneys are the typical metanephric type found in mammals . There is no urinary bladder for storage of the urine . The urine , which consists mainly of uric acid and urates , passes slowly down the ureters and empties into the cloaca in a semisolid condition . It is then expelled along with the feces . The excretory wastes can be recognized as the whitish material on the feces . REPRODUCTION There are two oval testes which lie just anterior to the kidneys in the males . A much convoluted vas deferens extends posteriorly from each testis and in some birds it enlarges and forms a seminal vesicle just before entering the cloaca . In the ducks and ostriches there is a penis in the cloaca , but in most birds this is not present in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present in the young . This is found in the embryonic chick and remains for a few days after hatching . It is possible // to determine sex at this time by exerting pressure on the abdomen , thus everting the cloaca ; the vestigial penis can then be seen if the chick is a male . In copulation sperms are transferred directly from the cloaca of the male to the cloaca of the female . In females the left ovary produces eggs ; the right ovary and oviduct are ' rudimentary and do not function . The mature eggs in the ovary consist mainly of yolk and the nucleus containing the chromosomes . They break out and enter the oviduct . As they pass through this tube the albuminous substance , the white of the egg , is added . Then a double parchment-like shell membrane is added to the outside . Finally , the shell is added and the egg is ready for laying . If birds get an insufficient amount of calcium in the diet they may lay " soft shell " eggs . These have only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fertilization seems to occur in the upper oviduct before the albumen is formed around the egg . Actually , therefore , the term " egg " is not scientifically accurate for the object which is finally laid ; it represents a zygote if the female has been fertilized . ( See Chapter 33 for details of bird embryology . ) Courtship among birds is highly developed . In many species the males will strut and perform to attract the females for days or even weeks before the actual copulation . In prairie chickens , for instance , // the males select a territory during mating season and defend this against all other males . They attract the females to their territory by a booming sound which they produce by inflating and deflating air sacs on either side of the neck . They also do a ritual dance in which they rush forward , stop suddenly , and stamp their feet . This may continue for as long as six weeks before the females come into the territory and permit mating . Many male birds spread and display their plumage before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peacock with its brilliantly colored tail which it spreads during the mating season . In many cases courtship serves an important biological function . The females may require it if they are to produce eggs . The male lyrebird of Queensland , famous for its song and the lyre-shaped tail , spends several months on his mound displaying his feathers and singing . A female may be watching from the surrounding trees and if she is not stimulated by the display there will be no eggs produced . A female pigeon when reared in isolation will not produce eggs , but if she is placed where she can see a male strutting the eggs will be formed . It has been found that the eggs will also be produced without a male being near if her neck is tickled in the way the male tickles it with his beak during courtship . Some birds part company soon after the mating process , others remain together and share the nesting and raising of the young , while some select mates for life and will mate with no other even if the partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much alike that the males can not recognize the females by sight and , with their poorly developed sense of smell , odor can not be a means of identification , as it is in some vertebrates . They must resort to methods of courtship to make the determination . The common tern males will present a fish to any other tern that appears receptive . If the fish is accepted , he knows it is a female and will bow to her , make a nest for her in the sand and mate . Should the fish be proffered to another male , it will be rejected with an aggressive peck . Penguins have a similar method , only a small pebble is the sex offering in this case . Since birds are warm-blooded the eggs must be incubated if they are to hatch . A small embryo can not generate sufficient heat to maintain a constant high body temperature . Most birds build a nest in which this incubation is done . Nest building is one of the most remarkable instincts in the entire animal kingdom . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nest in a particular way . // A young female bird hatched out in a commercial incubator and raised completely separated from all other birds will still build a nest typical of her species . She will use the same materials , choose the same type of locality , and construct it in the same shape as has been done by her ancestors for centuries past . Many birds use saliva for sticking the pieces of the nest together . There is one , the salangane swift , living in southeast Asia and the surrounding islands , that lines its nest entirely with saliva . These nests are collected by the natives of these regions and used for making bird's-nest soup . The nests are built in rather inaccessible caves along the seacoast and their collection is somewhat hazardous . This , along with the fact that excessive collection has greatly reduced the numbers of these birds , makes them scarce and hard to get . The best nests bring from ten to fifteen dollars a pound . The number of eggs laid varies from one to twenty or more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in some species , such // as doves and the ostriches , the male will share the brooding . There are even some species in which the male does it all ? the kiwi and emu are examples . The time of incubation varies ; in general the larger the egg , the longer the brooding period . The ostrich requires 42 days , the Canada goose 29 days , the domestic chicken 21 days , the crow 18 days , and the robin 13 days . Most birds hatch as ugly , naked , blind bundles of protoplasm , awkward and ungainly , but with very large mouths which open at the slightest sound which might indicate that food is coming . The mother bird and sometimes the father are kept busy providing food for the ravenous appetites of their offspring . When many young are in the nest how can the parent bird decide which mouth to feed so that some will not get more than their share while others starve ? It appears that there must be . a time lapse after the swallowing of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hence , the parent bird places the food in the first open mouth it comes to , but watches to see if the food goes down . If it does not go down immediately , she removes it and places it in a second mouth and repeats the watching . Thus , birds recently fed will not get food needed by others . An enormous amount of food is required for the growing young and many trips must be made by the parents . One wren was observed to make 1217 such feeding trips between sunrise and nightfall of one day . Altricial young are the naked , blind , and helpless ones described above . These are characteristic of most of the perching birds . Some birds , however , have precocial voting which are hatched covered with down with eyes open , and able to begin walking shortly after hatching . // The chickens , grouse , pheasants , ducks , and loons are examples . These are generally birds which nest on the ground . Protection of the young reaches a high degree of development in the birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A mother hen with baby chicks can make a dog turn tail and run . A clever means of deception is used by the quail and other ground-nesting birds to draw enemies away from their nests . When a possible enemy approaches , the mother quail will dart from the nest flying and fluttering on the ground like a bird with a broken wing . The predator will most probably give chase , since this appears to be an easily obtained meal . After leading him for some distance , however , the female will fly into the air , leaving the predator a safe distance from the nest . This broken-wing trick is familiar to all who walk in regions where such birds are found . MIGRATION The power of flight gives birds a means of rapid , fairly easy transportation which is not possessed by most other vertebrate animals . Many utilize this ability in migration flights which may take them over thousands of miles each year and enable them to live the year round in surroundings where food is abundant , the days are long , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do not cover more than about 25 miles a day , but some may make long-distance flights of 2,000 miles or more at one hop . A number of birds winter in South America and spend the summer in northern Canada , traveling up to 14,000 miles each year . The long distance record , however , is held by the Arctic tern , which nests in the summer inside the Arctic Circle , then flies down the eastern coast of Canada , across the Atlantic , down the west coast of Europe , down the west coast of Africa , and finally ends up in the Ant= , retie region where it spends the northern winter months . This makes a yearly round trip of about 25,000 miles . These terns spend both winter and summer near the poles at the time when the sun never sets . This pattern of migration gives them a maximum of daylight at all times . It has generally been assumed that bird migration is an adaptation which permits the avoidance of extremes of weather , and this is certainly one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will leave southern areas in the spring when there is an abundance of food and the weather is favorable and perhaps fly into the teeth of a late spring blizzard on their way north . It seems that the length of day is more // important than the temperature factor in triggering the migration instinct . In summer the days are longer in the north than in the south , but in the winter the conditions are just reversed . Most birds feed only when it is light and go to roost when it becomes dark . Thus , they have longer periods for feeding in the regions of long day and will feed for the entire 24 hours in regions where the sun never sets . Poultrymen sometimes take advantage of this and keep lights on in the poultry houses at night . The chickens will feed almost continuously and grow much faster and lay more eggs than would be the case if they spend half of their time roosting . Experiments indicate that , in some birds at least , the photoperiod ( amount of daylight ) initiates hormonal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ migratory bird in the north in midsummer can be put in a cage which is kept covered so as to shut out the light for a part of each day . This gives him an artificially short day similar in length to those occurring in the fall . When released from the cage he will start his southward migration . This explains why the birds of a certain species arrive at a certain place at about the same time each year even though weather conditions may vary considerably from one year to another . The arrival of the swallows at the mission of San Juan Capistrano in California occurs on almost exactly the same day each year . There has been considerable speculation about how birds find their way during migration . In some cases it appears that an older bird leads the way and that he follows landmarks along the way . Such birds will stop their flight when the weather becomes too overcast to permit them to follow these landmarks . There are some birds , however , which migrate thousands of miles over open water and find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some have suggested that birds have some sense organ which tells them their position by the magnetic field of the earth and the force brought about by the earth 's rotation . Some experiments seem to indicate that there are some migratory birds that actually navigate by means of the position of the sun and stars and can make allowance for the changes in relative position of these through an internal time mechanism . FOSSIL BIRDS As already mentioned , birds appear to have a reptilian origin . This theory is supported by fossil remains of prehistoric birds . In slabs of limestone near Solenhofen in southern Germany the fossilized reFossil // mains of two birds were found which were quite different from modern birds . They were given the genus name of Archaeornis ( Archaeopteryx ) . There is a clear imprint of feathers which indicates that they were true birds and were warm-blooded , but these birds also had teeth similar to reptile teeth . Also , there was a long , bony tail with thirteen separate vertebrae . The creatures were about the size of a modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the body did not have feathers . There was not the enlarged breastbone found in modern birds and there were digits with well-developed claws on the wing bones . Archaeornis probably had little power of flight , but could run and glide with some degree of efficiency . Other fossils of toothed birds have been found in Kansas , Montana , and Europe , but Archaeornis appears to be the most primitive . // SOME REPRESENTATIVE BIRDS There are about twenty-seven orders of birds , with many varied families under most of the orders ; so it will be impossible to give a complete survey of the field . However , by taking a few well-known birds and learning something about their habits , we may better understand the class . . The Eagles . The American national bird , the bald eagle , is not really bald , but has a thatch of white feathers on its head that makes it appear bald at a distance . It is a majestic bird , with a wing spread of about six feet , that soars high in the air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prey . It catches fish and some mammals for food . Unfortunately , everything that can be said about our national bird is not good . It is sometimes a robber . It will soar in the air watching the osprey hawks . When the osprey dives in the water and brings out a fish , the eagle will fall out of the sky and attack the smaller osprey , causing it to let the fish go . The eagle then drops down , catches the fish in the air , and flies away . There are tales of eagles carrying off small children and other large objects , but even the largest of the eagles could not lift a weight of more than eight pounds . Eagles build huge nests of sticks in rocky , inaccessible places in which they live and raise their young year after year . The Owls . " Wise as an owl " is an old saying ; it would seem that any creature that looks so dignified and sits so long , apparently in deep meditation , must be wise . However , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite active as they fly about in search of nocturnal rodents . They have eyes that are probably the keenest in the animal kingdom . During the daytime the pupils become reduced to small dots , but , contrary to superstition , they can see during the daytime . At night , in the reduced light , the pupils enlarge tremendously , enabling then ) to see clearly in the darkest forests . The pupils are able to change // their size almost instantly and an owl can chase a mouse from the bright moonlight into a dark forest without difficulty . The eyes of owls are placed side by side on the front of the head so that they look straight ahead , and the owls have to turn the head to see in different directions . When an owl looks at something behind it , the head gives the appearance of being attached backwards . Most owls are beneficial , since rodents seem to be their main food ; but sometimes the great horned owl finds that it is easier to catch chickens and other domesticated birds , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneficial and should not be destroyed . The little screech owl gives out an eerie cry that may be frightening on a dark night , but it eats many insects and mice . In many of the western states there is a superstition that the little burrowing owl lives in the same burrow with prairie dogs and rattlesnakes . It often lives in a prairie dog hole , but devours the original occupant first and in turn is probably devoured by any rattlesnake that may enter the hole . The Vultures . The vultures , or buzzards , are close relatives of the hawks , but lack the strong beak and the strong legs of the hawks . Therefore , they do not attempt to catch live prey , but devour anything that is dead . No rural landscape is complete without several buzzards gliding high in the air on a sharp lookout for the carcass of a dead animal . The repugnant odor of decaying flesh seems not to bother them at all . They seem completely immune to the poisons of bacteria that may be present in such flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since they can not carry things well in their claws , the young are fed on a regurgitation of partly digested flesh . The Loons . Visitors to the lakes in the northern part of the United States will probably never forget the cry of the loon sounding over the water in the middle of the night like the hysterical laughter of a lunatic . However , the loon is anything but a lunatic . It is very hard to get near one ; it will dive under the water when you approach in a boat , suddenly pop up behind you , dive again , and appear again in some unexpected direction as if mocking your efforts to outsmart it . Loons are diving birds , sometimes diving and swimming under water to a depth of fifty feet . A fish or frog does not have a chance against a loon , for the loon can outswim it under water . The Hummingbirds . These are the midgets of the birds ; the eggs are little larger than pearls , and a young hummingbird will ( ill only a portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at such a high // rate of speed that the characteristic humming sound is produced that gives them their name . One of their most interesting achievements is their ability to remain motionless in midair . When doing this the wings vibrate so rapidly that they can not be seen , and it appears as if a wingless bird is suspended in space without any visible means of support . Since even their tiny bodies would be too heavy for most flowers , this is an adaptation for their nectar-sucking habits . They suspend themselves in the air while thrusting their long bills down in the flower for a drop of sweet nectar . A jar of sugar-sweetened water outside a win- dow sill may attract these friendly little visitors for close observation . Small as they are , they are among the most fearless of birds , evidently feeling confidence in their speed and maneuverability to escape at a sign of danger . The Ostrich . While we are dealing with extremes we might mention the largest of the living birds . The ostrich may be more than eight feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only two toes , which are covered with broad pads and are well adapted to travel in the desert . Ostriches easily take twenty-five feet in a stride and travel more than twenty-five stiles an hour . The tale about burying the head in the sand to escape detection seems to have 110 foundation in fact . They lay a // single egg , which will weigh about three pounds and requires forty-five days ' incubation for hatching . The Woodpeckers . It would be hard to believe that any bird had a bill sharp enough and a head and neck strong enough to dig holes in solid wood if we did not actually see it . The woodpeckers are very well adapted for this activity . The feet have sharp claws that can cling to slight outgrowths of bark and the tail is held against the tree for firm support , while the long sharp bill is driven into the wood with a very rapid series of blows , like an air hammer digging into concrete . Most woodpeckers are beneficial because their pecking is done in search of insects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well adapted for getting the insects , is long and bears a barb on the tip , so that it can be thrust down a slender hole to stick insects and bring them out to eat . One of the woodpeckers , the yellow-bellied sapsucker , has become harmful , for it has discovered that it can dig holes in trees and sap will fill the holes . Then it can suck this sap out as its food . The Cowbird . Cowbirds are one of the few birds that are parasitic . They lay their eggs in other birds ' nests and allow foster parents to feed and care for their young offspring . The female cowbird spends most of her time ( luring the nesting season searching for recently built nests in which the clutch of eggs is not complete and the parents have not yet started incubating . When she finds such a nest she picks up one of the eggs in her bill and flies away with it . Early the next morning usually before sunrise , she slips into the nest and replaces the missing egg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner of the nest comes to lay another egg , she finds the number of eggs unchanged and usually does not notice that one of the eggs is different in size and color . There is an interesting hypothesis to explain this odd practice of the cowbird . The old name for this bird was buffalo bird , because it always fed around the great herds of American buffaloes that once inhabited our great plains . Since these buffaloes were great wanderers , the cowbirds often found themselves far from their own nest when the time came to lay an egg . They had to deposit it somewhere and those that were fortunate enough to find a fresh nest of another species left survivors , whereas those that left their egg on the ground did not . In this way , according to this hypothesis , the instinct to lay their eggs in the nest of other birds was developed in the cowbirds by natural selection . A few birds reject the strange egg . The yellow warbler buries it in the bottom of her nest often with several eggs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first one and lays a new clutch of eggs . The robin , which has a blue egg very different in color from the pale spotted egg of the cowbird , throws the foreign egg from the nest . Most other birds , however , seem not to notice the difference . A commonly parasitized species is the song sparrow , which lays a spotted egg rather similar in appearance to that of a cowbird , although smaller . The incubation time of the cowbird is only eleven days , one day shorter than that of the song sparrow . This generally results in the young cowbird hatching one day before the sparrows . When food is brought to the nestlings , the larger cowbird manages to get most of it and may even crowd the young song sparrows from the nest . It is an amusing , yet somewhat tragic , sight to sec a song sparrow stuffing food down the huge mouth of a baby cowbird twice her own size while her own offspring are reaching for food . As soon as the cowbird is able to feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flock of birds of its own species . It is doubtful whether the cowbirds reduce the song birds to any appreciable extent , however . Quail . The quail , partridge , or bobwhite , so called by different people in different sections of the country , is among the most tasty of the game birds . It has comparatively small wings and must vibrate them very rapidly during flight , so that they produce a characteristic whirring noise that sounds like a miniature airplane taking off . The male excavates a place in the ground and lines it with leaves and grass and takes turns sitting on the eggs . The young quail usually stay // with them parents after they have matured , so quail are usually seen in coveys . When flushed they scatter in all directions and reassemble after the danger is past , finding each other through a special call . When sleeping , the covey is gathered in a circle facing outward , so that if they are disturbed during the night they can take sudden flight without colliding with others in the darkness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a stand and give their bobwhite call , hoping to attract females to their nesting grounds . Bachelor males will keep up the call throughout the summer . The Storks . Strange to say , one of the best-known birds does not even live in the United States , although a close relative , the wood ibis , is found along our shores . Storks are abundant in the coastal regions of Europe and have a habit of building their nests on the tops of houses . In many countries this is considered an omen of good luck and they are never driven away . Just how they became an accessory in maternity is not clearly known , but a stork serenely perched on one leg on top of a chimney after a baby was born would offer an easy answer to embarrassing questions from the other children . The storks are members of the wading birds whose long legs make it possible for them to wade in // shallow water picking out fish and other water animals with their long bills . Chapter 28 ) Class Mammalia The Mammals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals on the earth . They are a very successful group , having replaced the reptiles as the dominant large animals of the earth . Many body organs , such as the heart and brain , reach their height of development in the mammals , culminating a long series of gradual changes that started back in the invertebrates . CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MAMMALS Hair . Only the mammals have hair on their bodies ; most of them have the body almost covered with hair . Even man , whom we think of as a fairly hairless creature , has hair everywhere on the body except the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet . Mammary Glands . The mammals take their name from the mammary glands which , in the females , enlarge and produce milk when they bear young . We commonly express this by saying that the mammals nurse their young . Embryonic mammals have a mammary ridge on either side of the ventral surface of the body . In most mammals nipples develop along the entire length of this ridge ; dogs and cats are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cows , nipples develop only at the posterior end of this ridge ; in others , such as elephants and human beings , only a single pair of nipples may develop at the anterior end . Occasionally , however , supernumerary nipples appear in addition ' to those which are usually found in the species . Cows may often be seen with an extra pair of nipples anterior to the two normal pairs . These are usually rudimentary and give no milk . Human beings sometimes have from one to three pairs of nipples posterior to the normal pair , formed in a row like those found in the dog . Diaphragm . This is an internal muscular partition separating the best I rum the abdomen which can be raised and lowered to exhale and ? 177 // inhale air . Mammals also use chest expansion for respiration , as do reptiles and birds . Warm-bloodedness . Like the birds , the mammals maintain a constant high body temperature . The rate of metabolism is rather high , and this generates the necessary heat and holds the body temperature at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Complex Teeth . The teeth in the lower vertebrates possessing them are usually just a row of cone-like projections , with a few exceptions , such as the fangs of poisonous snakes . In mammals , the teeth are specialized to accomplish specific functions . There are incisors for cutting , canine for tearing , premolars and molars for grinding . These are developed in varying degrees in different mammals according to different feeding habits . Placenta . All but the two most primitive orders of mammals have a placenta , which is an organ that grows out from a developing embryo and becomes firmly attached to the uterus of its mother and absorbs food and oxygen from the blood of the mother . When the mother nourishes // the embryo in this way it is unnecessary to have a large amount of yolk in the eggs , so mammal eggs are much smaller than those of other vertebrates . A rabbit egg is no larger than a dot made with the point of a fine-pointed pencil . This is true viviparous reproduction , the young being born alive , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where eggs are laid . There are some egg-laying animals whose eggs hatch before being laid , so that the young are born alive . They are sometimes called ovoviviparous to distinguish them from the true viviparous animals in which the embryo receives nourishment from the mother 's blood during development . Highly Developed Cerebrum . Whereas the birds concentrate on a highly developed cerebellum , for control of equilibrium and muscle coordination necessary for flight , the mammals have developed the cerebrum to the greatest size and complexity found in the vertebrates . Since the cerebrum is concerned with processes of learning and reasoning , the mammals can probably be considered the smartest animals on the earth . The cerebrum has complex folds in the higher mammals which increase its efficiency , for the outer gray matter of the cerebrum is the functional part and when the outer part folds inward the amount of gray matter is greater than it would be otherwise . Man has by far the largest cerebrum and it bears more convolutions in proportion to his size than that of ally other animal . 480 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and birds have a cloaca ? a cavity at the terminal end of the intestine into which the wastes of digestion as well as the urogenital products are emptied . Thus , the cloacal aperture serves as the external opening for all of these . In the embryonic mammals a cloaca is formed , but tissue grows between the anus and the openings of the urogenital system , so that there are separate openings in the adult . The first order of mammals is an exception , however , and does possess a cloaca as an adult . ORDER MONOTREMATA This order includes the most primitive of the mammals . They have hair on their bodies , mammary glands , and other characteristics that cause them to be classified as true mammals , but they have a cloaca and lay eggs like the reptiles and birds . The little duckbill of Australia is one of the few examples of this interesting order of mammals . It has a bill like a duck , fur like a seal , webbed feet like a frog , and barks like a dog ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals . The female lays eggs which have shells like birds ' eggs . She makes an underground nest lined with dried grass and the young hatch out after a short period of incubation . There are no // nipples to the mammary glands , but the ventral surface of the body is covered by a broad milk field . When feeding time arrives the mother lies on her back and the young crawl on her abdomen and lap up the milk that flows out from the pores of the skin . ORDER MARSUPIALIA ' Hu , marsupials are advanced over the monotremes in some respects , but are primitive in a number of their characteristics when compared // with the other mammals . There is no cloaca in the adult ? openings of the anus and the urogenital tubes are separate . The mammary glands have well developed nipples , and there are special muscles to pump the milk down the throats of the nearly helpless young . The eggs are large and , in most species of marsupials , contain all the food which will be used by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species in which rudimentary placentae are developed , but these accomplish little in the way of nourishment . // The opossum is one of the best known of the marsupials . It is very abundant in our southern states and furnishes the main dish at many a rural dinner of " possum and taters . " The opossum eggs are retained in the uterus until they hatch , which is only thirteen days after fertilization , so the young are very tiny and in an early embryological stage of development . They will be no more than half an inch long , but have sharp little claws by means of which they climb up the mother 's body and enter the pouch on the ventral surface of her body . There they find the nipples and each little opossum grabs a nipple , which he sucks down his throat , and his mouth actually grows onto the nipple . When they have completed their embryonic development they leave the pouch , but clamber back in to nurse or when there is danger . The kangaroo and the cuddly little koala bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little animals , named for their insect-eating habits , have a placenta and true viviparous reproduction , as do all the rest of the orders of mammals . Their teeth have an outgrowth near the base which protects the gums from the hard parts of insect bodies . The little mole shows how animals may be adapted to their living conditions . Moles spend most of their waking hours burrowing along under the ground in search of insects that may be there . They frequently go down a freshly planted garden furrow because the burrowing is easier there ; the fact that they uproot the plants growing there is only incidental . They have powerful front legs with sharp claws , and they move along underground with the same movements that a person uses to swim the breast stroke under water . Their eyes have become degenerate and the eyelids remain fused together throughout life . The external ears also are covered with skin . Both of these adaptations have persisted because they have survival value ? they keep dirt out of these organs . The shrew has been described as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shakespeare showed that he knew his biology when he selected the title , " The Taming of the Shrew , " for his clever comedy . The shrew is the smallest of the mammals and is about as small as any // warm-blooded animal can be . The smaller the mammal , the greater is the exposed body surface in proportion to its size and the more it has to eat to keep warm . When a tiny shrew is placed in a cage with a mouse which is many times larger , the mouse will be so terrified that it will allow the shrew to eat it with hardly a token resistance . A shrew must cat about one and one-half times its body weight per day in order to live . Think of a person eating 225 pounds of food per day and you can appreciate the problems facing the shrews in finding and digesting sufficient food to keep alive . A shrew will die of starvation in a few hours it it is deprived of food . Order Chiroptera 487 ORDER CHIROPTERA This order includes the bats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squirrels , but they only glide . ) The finger bones of the last three fingers of each hand are greatly elongated and skin is stretched between the fingers to form the wings . The first two fingers terminate in claws which the bats use to suspend themselves upside down while they are sleeping during the daytime . Bats come out at dusk and fly around during the night in search of insects . It is an amazing sight to see the bats come circling up out of Carlsbad Caverns by the thousands every evening . Bats orient themselves and avoid collisions with trees , buildings , and other objects by giving out shrill cries that are higher in pitch than the human ear can hear . As the echoes of their cries come back to them they know the nearness of solid objects and can avoid them . Not all bats eat insects . The vampire bats of the tropics will bite a person or other large animal , such as a cow , and lap up the blood as it flows out . In Europe there is an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by night and go around sucking blood . Such people are called vampires . ORDER CARNIVORA These are the carnivorous mammals that include meat as an important item of their diet . Most of them are predatory and have strong agile bodies , with sharp claws and teeth ? adaptations to catch and kill the animals they prey upon . All of their teeth are pointed , an adaptation for cutting and tearing flesh ; they have no teeth for chewing , so the food is cut up into small chunks and swallowed . The Cats . The members of this family are easily recognized by their similarity to the familiar house cat . They include the lions , tigers , leopards , pumas , wild cats , house cats , and similar animals . They are adapted for stalking their prey and then pouncing on it with one sudden burst of speed and , as a rule , are not capable of long sustained high speed . // The Dogs . The dog-like carnivores often depend on running their prey down in a long chase in contrast to the cats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in addition to our common dog . The Hyenas . These strange-looking animals ordinarily do not kill their own prey , but wait for some of the bolder carnivores , such as the lions , to do the killing . Then when the lion has eaten his fill they come in and devour what is left of the carcass . They have the strongest jaws of any mammal and can easily crush large bones with their teeth . The Raccoons . These little carnivores are found near the water and often catch crayfish , fish , and clams for food . They seem very particular about their eating , for they thoroughly wash their food before eating it , if water is available . This habit , however , seems not so much to be cleanliness as it is an aid to swallowing . The salivary glands are not well developed , and the food is more easily swallowed when wet . They // have delicate little hand-like front paws which they use to handle the food while washing and eating it . They tame easily , and many a boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , coons still like chickens , and it is a little too much to expect them to know that chickens are a special kind of bird that should not be killed . The rare but well-known pandas from the mountains of Tibet are in the raccoon family . The Civet Cats . The civet cats are found in oriental countries and the mongoose of India is one of the group . The mongoose is known for its ability to fight and kill cobras . It is not immune to cobra poison , but is so quick that it can tease a cobra into striking and dart in and grab it back of the neck before the cobra can get back into position to strike again . The Musk-Bearing Carnivores . The skunk is the first animal thought of when animals with an odor are mentioned . It bears special musk glands which can eject an odor , there being none more odoriferous . Confident of this protection , the skunk goes serenely on its way through 490 The Mammals the forests and is usually given a wide berth by all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to come too close , the skunk will first raise its tail and wave it as a warning signal , then will give a little jump with its hind legs and squirt a few drops of its musk at the intruder . That will be last time that intruder will molest any animal even faintly resembling a skunk . There are many others in this family that do not have such a pronounced odor and do not throw their musk . They are a blood-thirsty group , including martens , minks , badgers , ermines , sables , weasels , and otters . In spite of the rather nauseating odor of some of the live animals , they possess some of the most valuable furs on the market . The Bears . These are the largest of the carnivores . They are more omnivorous in their diet than most of the order and have teeth adapted to do some grinding . The black bears of North America are the ones most commonly seen . No one can make a trip to Yellowstone Park without seeing the black bears , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highways for handouts from passing cars . They seem to be very tolerant toward the many tourists and their inevitable cameras , but occasionally people will get bitten when they take undue liberties // with the bears and forget that these are wild animals . The brown bears and cinnamon bears are only different color phases of the black bear , just as we have the blondes , brunettes , and redheads in human beings . Grizzly bears are also found in the park , but are not bears to be fooled with , for they are quite dangerous . Fortunately , they stay away from people and are seldom seen along the highways or in the camps . They get their name from a silver ring found around each hair that gives them a grizzled appearance . The Aquatic Carnivores . Like the whales , this is another group that is modified for life in the water , although they may spend considerable time out of the water . Fish provide the main item of their diet . They are masters at diving and swimming under water . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No zoo of any size is complete without it sea lion pool , where these interesting creatures seem to get great enjoyment from showing ulf for the crowds . The trained sea lions of // the circus show that they are experts at balance and can be taught to do many intricate tricks if the keepers ' supply of fish holds out . The walruses are larger than the sea lions and live primarily in arctic regions . They are distinguished by their mustaches and the large tusk-like canine teeth that protrude from their upper jaws . The seals are also found in cold climates and are well known as the source of sealskin coats . ORDER UNGULATA Members of this order are characterized by the highly developed grinding teeth in their jaws ? an adaptation to their herbivorous diet ? and the presence of hoofs . Most of them stand on the tips of their toes with their heels never touching the ground . This makes it appear as if they have three joints in the legs rather than the two found in other vertebrates . The toenails , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce the hoofs . The Odd-Toed Ungulates . The horses are the most abundant of this group . They use only one toe on each foot , which is greatly enlarged . This is the third , or middle toe , but rudimentary second and fourth toes can be seen higher up the leg , although they do not touch the ground . There were prehistoric horses that used four toes and more recently those that used three toes . A fairly complete history of the development of horses has been worked out from fossils . This is discussed more fully in Chapter 34 . The donkeys and zebras are very similar in their structure to our modern horse . // The tapirs are also placed in the odd-toed group , but they have four toes on the front feet and three on the hind feet . The rhinoceros is a well-known ungulate that has three toes on both front and hind feet . They have one or two " horns " coming out of the median dorsal region of the head . These are not true horns , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this region . . The Even-Toed Ungulates . Most of these ungulates use two of their toes , the second and third , which are incompletely fused together to form the hoof . They are often spoken of as the animals with a cloven hoof because of the slit between the two toes . There is one group of the even-toed ungulates which have a special four-chambered stomach . Animals in this group are known as ruminants . They can swallow their food rapidly when they may be grazing out in an exposed place and store this food in a chamber known as the rumen . Then they can retire to a protected place where they can chew the food at leisure . The second chamber , the recticulum , forms a mass of this unchewed food , which is regurgitated a mouthful at a time and chewed thoroughly before being swallowed a second time . This time it goes into the third chamber , the psalterium , which is filled with folds that strain out the larger particles and return them to be chewed some more . The well-chewed food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is the true stomach where the digestive glands are located . Such animals are said to chew a cud . There is an old superstition which holds that a cow must chew a cud in order to be contented and that she will die if she loses her cud . Many a cow has been given a ball of rags to chew on when an owner thought that she had lost her cud . The ruminants include cattle , deer , elks , antelopes , goats , sheep , giraffes , camels , and llamas . Those even-toed ungulates which are not ruminants include the hogs , peccaries , and the hippopotamus . The latter uses four toes on each foot . Even our common pig has four rather well-developed toes , but the second and third are usually the only ones that touch the ground . ORDER CETACEA This group includes the whales , porpoises , and dolphins . Whales are sometimes thought of as fish because they live in the water and have // a body that is somewhat fish-like in shape . However , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mammary glands after birth , breathe with lungs , and have the other typical mammalian characteristics . The tail is horizontal , rather than vertical as in fish . This makes them swim with an up-and-down rolling motion in contrast to the side-to-side movements of the fish . The whales have the distinction of being the largest animals that have ever existed . One measured 103 feet long , and weighed the tremendous amount of 294,000 pounds . Whales have a heavy deposit of fat , or blubber , under the skin that gives them good insulation from the cold waters in which they are often found . Unfortunately for the whales , this blubber furnishes commercially valuable whale oil and so they are hunted by whaling vessels . They may also have an extremely valuable substance , ambergris , in the intestine , from which the most expensive perfumes are made . Some species have long strainers in their mouths called whalebone , which in the past was used extensively for stays in women 's corsets ; hilt changing styles in feminine figures and other means of control of body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their use in this respect . The whales have their single nostril on the top of the head . They may be seen " hlosving " at it great distance . This spoilt , which can be // seen coming up from the nostril , is formed of condensing moisture and is not a spout of water . If the outside air is cool , the warm air from the lungs will condense and form a visible water vapor , just as a person 's breath condenses on a cold day . The porpoises are miniature editions of the whales , their structure being about the same . They are an interesting sight following in the wake of boats , with their rolling motions ; and sometimes they jump entirely out of the water . Experiments in training porpoises at Marineland , Florida , and other oceanaria indicate that porpoises may be among the most intelligent of the mammals . They learn intricate routines , such as shooting basketballs through a goal , and delight the visiting tourists with their many antics . They seem to enjoy human company and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack and drive off large sharks which may approach a school of porpoises . ORDER PROBOSCIDEA The only living members of this order are the elephants , the largest of living land animals . There are two varieties : the African elephant , which may be 11% feet tall at the shoulders and has huge ears that completely cover its shoulders ; and the Indian elephant , which may be 10 feet tall and has smaller ears . In spite of their huge size they are rather easily captured and tamed and become valuable beasts of burden iii tropical countries . In some parts of India , travel by elephant is the only way a person can get through a dense jungle . The tusks , which may be more than 11 feet long in the African elephant , are a valuable source of ivory . // The woolly mammoths , whose bodies have been found in a nearly perfect state of preservation in Siberian ice fields , were.the prehistoric relatives of our modern elephants . Apparently these were the only members of the elephant family that have been capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these were found the flesh was so well refrigerated that it was actually fed to dogs and at a banquet in London mammoth steaks were served which had been in a deep freeze of Siberian ice for several thousand years . The tusks were sold for ivory . Still more ancient were the mastodons , which are believed to have lived in lush , tropical rain forests . ORDER SIRENIA Sometimes exhibits are set up at carnivals and circuses to allow the public to gaze on a real live mermaid for a small fee . With visions of a beauteous female creature , human-like from the waist up and fish-like from the waist down , the ever-gullible people buy their tickets . To say that they are disappointed is putting it mildly , when they walk in to see an ugly sea cow floating lazily in a tank of water . The sea cows are the real mermaids , although only a drunken sailor on a dark night could mistake one for the mythical siren that gives this order its name . They are found along the Atlantic coasts of Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida coast . Their bodies are adapted for life in the water , with the front legs modified into flippers and the hind legs absent . The tail is broadened and flattened out to form a finlike structure for swimming . ORDER RODENTIA This is the largest order of mammals , having more genera and species than any other , and it probably contains more individuals than all other orders of mammals combined . These mammals have many enemies , such as the snakes and birds , but they are extremely prolific in reproduction . They mature rapidly and the females have large numbers of off .. spring at frequent intervals during their lifetime . Mice will be ready for reproduction within three months after they have been born , have a gestation period of only twenty days , and have an average of about eight offspring every six weeks . Rodents are omnivorous in their diet and are man 's chief competitor among the mammals for food . In fact , their diet is so nearly like that of man that they are almost always used in dietary // experiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the human diet . Rodents have no canine teeth , but the incisors are long and curved . This is the most easily recognized characteristic of the group . The teeth continually grow from their roots and the rodents wear them down on the ends by gnawing on hard objects , so they will not become too long . The beavers are even able to gnaw down trees . The Squirrel-like Rodents . This large group includes the squirrels , ground squirrels , flying squirrels , chipmunks , gophers , ground hogs , prairie dogs , beavers , and others . The heavers are the largest rodents in the United States . They gnaw down trees and place them across streams to form dams . Cracks between the logs are filled in with mud . Then they build their homes over the lakes which are formed above the dams . These homes are above the water line , but have only underwater entrances . Thus they serve as an excellent retreat from enemies . The beavers are beneficial because these dams act as an aid in controlling erosion ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures were put into effect . The Rat-like Rodents . These are the many species of rats and mice which are so abundant the world over . They do tremendous damage to the food supply , during its growth and after it has been harvested and placed in storage . They also help spread some of the world 's most serious diseases , such as bubonic plague and typhus . Other Rodents . Porcupines have developed long , stiff , sharp-pointed hairs which have special muscles which can make them stand erect . Although they can not throw their quills , as is sometimes believed , there is a special mechanism to release the quills when they become stuck into another animal and many a coon dog has come away from an attack on a porcupine with quills embedded in his nose and mouth . The guinea // pig is another very well-known rodent . The chinchilla is a beautiful little rodent with very fine and soft fur . Chinchillas have been imported into the United States from the mountains of Chile and Bolivia , where they have been all but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started in the last few years with breeding pairs often selling at prices ranging from $1,000 to $1,500 . As yet the population has not reached a point where the chinchillas can be killed extensively for their pelts . When this point is reached they will probably be used widely for fur capes and trimmings . The fur is delicate and may not prove practical for entire coats . Without doubt they will be much cheaper as their numbers increase , because they are relatively easy to raise and inexpensive to keep . ORDER LAGOMORPHA This order includes the rabbits . They were formerly placed in the order Rodentia , but recent studies indicate that they have certain distinctive characteristics which warrant their inclusion in a separate order . They have gnawing teeth , but there are two rows of these teeth rather than a single row as in the rodents . Also , detailed serological studies have been made of the blood of the rabbits in comparison with the rodents , and the results of these tests indicate that the relationship of the two groups is not close enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
