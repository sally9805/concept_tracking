It is one of the many paradoxes of the Viet Nam war that while the demand for military officers is growing , one source of supply is dwindling steadily . Apart from the Federal Government 's four service academies , there are seven four-year military colleges in the U.S. , and they are surviving mainly by sharply de-escalating their military elements . They are , in fact , becoming more like civilian campuses every day-even to a few antiwar protesters and law-defying pot smokers . <P> The war itself is unpopular , and most students would rather gamble on the uncertainties of the draft than join cadet programs , which include at least two years ' active duty as a military officer . Besides , the current college generation takes an anti-Establishment view that scoffs at polished buttons and stiff-necked discipline . A military regimen has become an unappealing burden to add to academic chores . <P> Coeds &; Cadets . Outside of the service academies at West Point , Annapolis , Colorado Springs and New London , only three colleges remain as all-male institutions in which every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Military Institute and Vermont 's Norwich University . Three others ( Texas A. &; M. , Virginia Polytechnic Institute and Pennsylvania 's PMC Colleges ) have made the cadet corps optional for men . To the dismay of combat-toughened alumni , they have also admitted coeds to all civilian courses . The seventh school , North Georgia College , has always enrolled women . The combined cadet enrollment at the seven has suffered a decline , including a drop of nearly 50% at V.P.I , since 1960 . <P> The troubles of the military college are best illustrated by PMC Colleges in Chester , Pa . Started as a boys ' school in 1821 and known as Pennsylvania Military College for 73 years , the school was skidding toward bankruptcy before it opened a coed night division in 1954 , accepted full-time nonmilitary students in 1958 , finally added an all-civilian branch , called Penn Morton College , in 1966 . The trustees fought for two years over what to name the combination , finally agreed on PMC to please those alumni who wanted some suggestion of a military designation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some 100 beds in cadet dorms are now vacant , total enrollment has climbed to 1,500 ( it was as low as 650 in 1956 ) . <P> Potted to Pot . The PMC cadets still rise to reveille at 0700 , freeze to attention any time an upperclassman barges into their room . They live in fear of humorless student commanders , who rule their daily lives . This month two cadets were expelled and one suspended when the cadet brigade commander learned that they had returned to campus after a drinking spree and sprayed each other with a fire extinguisher-a prank that would have drawn little more than tolerant laughs at most other schools . Even so , PMC has turned soft , complains Senior Cadet James W. McConnell , president of the student council . " When we came here as freshmen it was much better-all military , " he says .
