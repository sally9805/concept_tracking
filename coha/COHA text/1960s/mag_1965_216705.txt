To connoisseurs of the East 's fabled " Seven Sisters " women 's colleges , Wel lesley girls stand out as a bit odd , at least as seen in stereotype . They are not given to the long hair , bulging book bags and breathless brilliance found at Radcliffe . They lack the Junior-League-socialite attitude of Smith . Vassar 's ear nest , do-gooder zeal eludes them ; nor do they share the compulsive egalitarianism of Barnard students . They are neither so muscularly athletic as the Bryn Mawr girls nor quite so country-sweet as the Mount Holyoke lasses . Their distinguishing characteristic , in short , is that they do n't stand out . They tend simply to be wholesome girls who make normal , well-adjusted housewives and civic-minded citizens . One important reason for that reputation is Wellesley College President Margaret Clapp , 55 , who emphasizes a well-balanced liberal-arts education for her girls . She is a sharp critic of what she calls " the smorgasbord school , " where students get a wide , undirected choice of elective courses that adds up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She prefers what she calls the " plate dinner-and-dessert " menu , in which basic courses are balanced with a few enticing extras . That philosophy comes fittingly to Margaret Clapp , who was a writer of poetry , a teacher of English , a Ph.D . and a respected historian before moving to the 500-acre , 90-year-old Massachusetts school 16 years ago ( TIME cover , Oct. 10 , 1949 ) . In addition to setting a brisk , workmanlike tone for her students , " Miss Clapp " ( never " Dr. " ) enhanced the character of the school itself with an admirable admin istrative skill . Keeping student enrollment to a steady 1,700 , she doubled the college 's endowment from $30 million to $62 million , increased faculty salaries from a 1950 average of $4,291 to last year 's $10,020 . Apparently , after 16 years Miss Clapp reckoned that she had completed her job . Last week she announced that she will resign next July . " I am convinced , " she said , " that Wellesley is at a point in time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Characteristically , she then proceeded to instruct her faculty on how to elect a committee to help choose her successor , and even on what to do in case of a tie vote . Whereupon , without fuss or fluster , she skipped off to a secluded vacation . Few faculty members shared her serenity and poise , and many failed to squelch the tears that flowed at the thought of Miss Clapp 's leaving .
