Jazz and dope often seem as closely linked as their jargon ; e.g. , the jazz terms " hip " and " hipster " are derived from opium smoking , during which the addict lies on one hip . Such famed hipsters as Gene Krupa , Thelonius Monk and the late Billie Holliday had their public problems with dope , and the jazz trade has long refused to book some big-name combos into cities where drugs are known to be hard to get .

Winick found that often there was " positive social pressure " on jazz players to use drugs , cited one band in which only one member did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the narcotics users because he took Miltown . Among the " benefits " the users feel they get from dope : 1 ) " contact high , " a sort of group excitement ; 2 ) release from personal problems ; and 3 ) a physical boost on road trips when they pull into a town after an all-day bus ride and have to play all evening . Said one player-who prefers drugs to alcohol : " If you drank feeling that tired , you 'd fall on your face . " <P> The vast majority taper off as they get older . Winick found that , of his subjects over 40 , only two were still hooked on heroin . Explained one 43-year-old jazzman who had kicked the habit : " I guess I just diminuendoed out of it .
