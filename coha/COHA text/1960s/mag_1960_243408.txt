Any other country might consider itself blessed to hear what the Department of Agriculture told the U.S. last week : " Gains in yield prospects give promise of making 1960 the nation 's biggest crop year . " In the U.S. , the news produced a shudder . <P> <P> Nature 's good tidings meant bad news for a lot of people : for farmers whose crops will be in oversupply , for the taxpayers who have to pay for costly federal programs to cope with farm surpluses , for harried Agriculture Secretary Ezra Taft Benson and for his successor in the next Administration . <P> <P> On the basis of the new crop reports , the next Secretary of Agriculture would have to abandon Benson 's assumption that lower federal price supports automatically lead to smaller crops and thereby get rid of gluts . When Congress let Benson test that assumption on corn last year-trimming the support price and abolishing the acreage controls-farmers expanded corn acreage by 15% . They harvested the biggest , most glutting corn crop in U.S. history . Farmers have again put just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in pros pect . <P> Benson 's successor will also have to drop the old assumption that the years of lean harvests come along and reduce the burdensome surpluses piled up in bountiful crop years . By old-fashioned norms , 1960 's wet spring , instead of leading to record harvests , should have brought on poor crops , by interfering with farmers ' spring sowing . But modern farm mechanization makes it possible for farmers to get their sowing done fast , during brief letups in the weather . Now a wet spring , storing up ground moisture for summer , brings bigger crops-and bigger headaches for the Secretary of Agriculture .
