ROMAN CATHOLICS <P> Martin Luther has been spoken of before in St. Peter 's Basilica ; last week , for the first time , he was mentioned favorably . At the Vatican Council , bolstering his argument to give the Virgin Mary a new title of honor , Polish Archbishop Josef Gawlina cited Luther 's devotion to her and quoted him as saying , in his exposition of St. John 's Gospel , that " she does not want to lead us to herself but , through herself , to God . " <P> Discussion of Mary 's relationship to the church was the session 's first contro versial order of business , after an impressive solemn pontifical Mass concelebrated by Pope Paul VI and 24 other bishops , and a demand for speed by council officials . To help nudge matters along , the popular coffee bars on each side of the aula were not opened until 11 , two hours after the morning sessions begin . But the Marian question may not be easily resolved , since the council fathers are closely divided between " maximalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain , Poland and Italy argued that the draft of the chapter on Mary was too timid and should include a new title of praise for the Virgin , such as " Mediatrix " between man and God . Some Latin American prelates warned that current excesses of devotion to Mary were a scandal to those outside the church and tended to obscure Christ 's unique mediation with God . Mexican Bishop Sergio Mendez Arceo dryly pointed out that if Mary were to be titled " Mother of the Church , " which is the mother of men , she becomes everybody 's grandmother . And Augustin Cardinal Bea , of the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity , argued that any title implying a new Marian doctrine would do grave harm to the cause of ecumenism.
