txt I Manitowoc , Wis. , Aug. 24 ? Victor Jackson , the East Lansing , Mich. , electronics repairman ? who tried and failed a month ago to cross Lake Michigan in a souped-up white cast iron bathtub , made the 80-mile trip today after more than 14 1/2 hours on the lake . Jackson . the object of a search by the coast guard after reports he had run out of fuel , arrived at the north pier lighthouse here at 8:58 p. m. with the 2-horsepower motor still functioning . The bathtub with yellow pontoons had started its voyage early this morning at Ludington , Mich . " A couple of times I 'd given up hope , " said Jackson , ? 32. after his voyage . " I thought you were going to be fishing me out of there tomorrow morning . " Only a Pint Let " I had less than a pint of gas left , " said Jackson , as he tied up more than an hour after sunset at a coast guard light at the end of a breakwater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just general problems with the motor , and the battery wore out . " " I had given up hope of ever making Manitowoc when I saw the light on that whatever you call it out there . " he said . Earlier in the evening , the coast guard sent a 44-foot boat and a plane to search the lake after Jackson had radioed ham operators that he was running out of fuel . At the time he estimated his position as about 15 miles due east of Manitowoc . Father Requests Search The search craft were dispatched at the request of Jackson 's father ? who had contacted the coast guard at Ludington . However , the coast guard had to rely on second hand information because it could n't pick up Jackson 's radio frequency and he was in contact only with ham operators . Jackson 's arrival . tho three hours later than he had planned , culminated a dream that grew out of a $5 bet with his boss . The lake was serene most of the trip , in contrast to Jackson 's crossing attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It all started when we were arguing at the plant whether a raft wrapped with beer cans could float across the lake , " Jackson explained . " Then the idea of the bathtub came along . " Jackson , a father of six , " probably took a couple of sandwiches and some water with him , " said his wife , Ariel . " I know he 'd been planning it for some time . He was waiting for the right weather , " she said . " The first I knew about his actually being out on the lake was when somebody called at seven o'clock this morning and told me he was about three or four miles out , " she said . A Crazy Idea " I thought it was a kind of crazy idea at first . But I guess it 's all right now . " On July 5 , Jackson , resplendent in red nylon jacket , failed in his first attempt to pilot the tub across the lake . Waves four to six feet high forced him to call the coast guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would n't try it again . " My radio gear developed trouble , " he said . This time he took a couple of ham radios and a special navigational radio , his wife said . Welds Drain Shut In addition , he 'd welded shut the drain in the 200-pound tub , which is registered with state as a leisure craft . About four miles out , Mrs. Jackson said her husband ran into trouble . " The coho salmon fishing fleet was making Waves , and it seems some water got into the boat . But he baled it out , " she said .
