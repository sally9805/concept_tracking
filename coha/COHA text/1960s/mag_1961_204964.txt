Not for years had the Middle East seen so quick and clean a coup . Streaking , north from barracks outside Damascus , a slim rebel force of 20 tanks seized the capital at dawn . There were no mob scenes , no assassinations and almost no gunfire . When they tuned into Damascus radio at breakfast , Syrians learned that they had been " liberated " from the United Arab Republic , of which their country had been an uneasy part for nearly four years . In northern Syria , Aleppo radio went dead in the midst of the anthem , Beloved Nasser , Lover of Egypt and Syria - returning ten minutes later with a searing tirade against Nasser , the " tyrant " who " wished evil for the Arab people . " <P> <P> At midnight , when Latakia radio went off the air , the U.A.R. 's last Syrian stronghold had fallen to the rebels . <P> <P> By noon next day , the rebel leaders proclaimed their independence . As U.A.R. flags yielded to Syria 's red-starred , green-white-black tricolor , they turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diffident , middle-roading law professor . The new Premier , Sorbonne-educated Dr. Mamoun ( " Trusted One " ) Kuz-bari , 47 , a former Minister of Justice , promised his countrymen constitutional government and " a true and democratic life . " Jordan , swift to welcome any setback to Nasser , was the first country to recognize the new regime ; it was followed by Turkey , which has also had strained relations with the U.A.R. <P> <P> Does Arab Fight Arab ? Egypt 's Gamal Abdel Nasser took to Cairo radio to denounce the revolt . In somber , ragged sentences , he declared : " What happened today is more serious than Suez . Any division in national unity is much more serious than foreign aggression . " To " straighten out the situation , " as he put it in his broadcast , Nasser ordered his fleet and 2,000 paratroops to take seaport Latakia , started commandeering merchantmen to haul ground troops to Syria , which is seperated from Egypt by Jordan , Lebanon and Israel . Suddenly , Nasser changed his mind . He called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landed . ( They surrendered . ) Explaining his decision , Nasser asked sadly : " Does Arab fight Arab ? For whose sake will blood be shed ? " To the last he insisted : " The U.A.R. will remain . " <P> <P> But the revolution was complete , ending in 48 hours the unequal union between little Syria ( pop . 4,500,000 ) and 26 million Egyptians . <P> Syrian Twitch . It was Syria 's President Shukri Kuwatly who had promoted the merger with Egypt , out of fear that his country might otherwise be taken over by a strong Communist clique in the army . While Nasser hailed the new state as " the first step on the path to complete Arab unity , " it was soon apparent to Syrians that their wealth was being siphoned off to prop impoverished Egypt . Nasser 's land reforms alienated landowners and hurt the economy . Businessmen , after long years of laissez faire , bitterly opposed Nasser 's import restrictions , currency controls , a new income tax , nationalization of banking and insurance .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
