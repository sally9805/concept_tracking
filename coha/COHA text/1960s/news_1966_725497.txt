txt Dirksen vs . Ford The two Republican congressional leaders , Sen. Everett McKinley Dirksen and Rep. Gerald R. Ford , differ in method , appearance , and over Vietnam . To some observers one of their most fundamental differences is that Senator Dirksen has made his peace with minority status . Representative Ford has not . For a close look at the two , turn to Page 3 . Washington Standing there in the joint " Ev-Jerry Show " before hot lights and 50 reporters they symbolized the split in the Republican Party . They were the two minority leaders , Sen. Everett McKinley Dirksen of Illinois , and Rep. Gerald R. Ford of Michigan . Physically they were vastly unlike . In viewpoint all their semantic efforts could not paper over their essential disagreement on President Johnson 's handling of Vietnam . The biggest difference of all was how to rehabilitate their party at one of its lowest ebbs in history . Mr. Ford is handsome , direct , broad-shouldered , square-jawed , and inclined to reach his objective by knocking the door down . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clabber , a national favorite , rejoicing in his own low-comedy bits , is as different from Mr. Ford in manner as he is in appearance . Reporters gleeful Reporters rubbed hands over the circumstance that brought these polished perform . ers to the point of insisting that there was no difference whatever between them when , if words meant anything , the chasm was broad . The midterm 1966 election is approaching with the GOP desperately needing recovery from its present 2-to-1 minority status in both houses , control of only 17 governor . ships , and voter loyalty preference that has been sinking since Hoover . Mr. Ford sounded the party tocsin . In Vietnam , he proclaimed , he found Democrats guilty of " shocking mismanagement " under circumstances amounting to a " national scandal . " With a newly acquired public-relations man , he is issuing almost daily excoriations of the rival party . Campaign opened Mr. Ford , in short , is opening a political campaign in the traditional way , and if Democratic leaders pretend horror , the fact is that they recognize the usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the " out " party . But Senator Dirksen is in a different category . He has fenced with the press continuously since the Ford attack began , insisting at one moment that there is no difference between them , and at the next substituting some mild phrase for Mr. Ford 's war whoops that almost caricatures them , like " error in calculation " in Vietnam for " shocking mismanagement . " Brought before television and pilloried by reporters , they offered comments such as these : " I do n't see any significant differences in our position , " said Mr. Ford ; " Oh , definitely not ! " said Mr. Dirksen . Exit reporters , laughing . Veteran vs. newcomer some observers think the difference is that Senator Dirksen has made his peace with minority status . Representative Ford has not . Mr. Dirksen is one of the most entertaining , most sought after , most powerful men in Washington today . Mr. Ford is a comparative newcomer . Mr. Dirksen is a friend of President Johnson 's and has done him favors for which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Bobby Baker " episode , helped muster votes for the Johnson civil-rights bill , and now is putting the brake on a hard-line Republican attack on Vietnam . Mr. Ford is little known nationally , still seems sometimes overshadowed by his powerful colleague , Rep. Melvin R. Laird ( R ) of Wisconsin , and has trouble holding his pitifully few ( 140 ) Republicans in line . Mr. Dirksen basks in the present ; Mr. Ford yearns for the future . Some think he would like to be considered for vice-president ; he certainly would like to become speaker . Either way lie needs an election victory . Mr. Dirksen needs nothing to keep him where he is . Some see in this relationship the dilemma of the Republican Party . Ray C. Bliss , chairman of the Republican National Committee , repeatedly implores that the base of the party , be widened , that it drop its " WASP-NN " label ( White , Anglo-Saxon , Protestant , Native born of Native parentage ) ; that it appeal to labor , immigrants , Negroes , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he is already a power broker in Congress . If a frightened industry sees danger of harsh federal regulation it is as apt as not to come to Mr. Dirksen . His shrewdness , his conservative supporters , his cozy relation with the White House , make his aid important . Doubltess he helps wealthy campaign contributors to remember the party . Mr. Dirksen fought the regulation of the drug industry in the Kefauver hearings . Just now he has identified the GOP in the Senate with the fight to undercut the Supreme Court 's one-man , one-vote reapportionment decision . Conservative farm and corporate interests backed him and all the elements who found it easy to deal with the rural-biased state legislatures . The reapportionment- fight was not likely to enlist city support for the GOP , which chairman Bliss desperately wants . Nor would Mr. Dirksen 's ardent fight against repeal of 14(B) in the Taft-Hartley Act ( which has become a kind of totem with organized labor ) help Republicans with trade unionists .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
