Since the 19th century , science and industry have honored a holy of holies : a bar of platinum-iridium alloy , triple-locked in a subbasement at Svres on the outskirts of Paris . Near the ends of the bar were engraved two microscopically thin lines , and the distance between them was exactly one meter-by international agreement , the world standard of measurement . Around the globe , other countries had copies of the bar at Svres , and their traditional units of length-feet ( 3.28 to a meter ) , versts , li , or whatever - were defined by reference to it . But last week the sacred bar was in effect tossed on the scrap heap . A General Conference on Weights and Measures , meeting at Paris , made a wave length of light the new official standard of length . The meter is now denned as 1,650,763.73 wave lengths of the orange-red light given off by electrically excited krypton 86 , a rare gas extracted from the atmosphere . The U.S. inch is 41.929.399 wave lengths . <P> The Old Last Word . Precise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laboratory wall in the U.S. Bureau of Standards hangs a blow-up of a 16th century woodcut showing 16 men lined up heel to toe to define the rute , an old German measure of length related to the English rod . That was fine for the 1500s . But since then , each advance in technology has required better measurements . The standard meter bar , adopted by 28 nations , including the U.S .. in 1875 , was considered the last word . Used with elaborate comparing devices , it could measure with an accuracy of one part in 10 million , and that seemed as good as would ever be needed . <P> But metrologists soon began to worry about the meter bar . It might be lost or destroyed , or its metal might change with time in subtle and unpredictable ways , altering the distance between the lines by a fatal few parts per million . Worst of all , as the years passed and technological requirements became even more devastatingly precise , the bar 's accuracy was no longer good enough . A master standard must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measuring systems that are derived from it , and modern industry began to call for tolerances expressed in millionths of an inch . An error of this infinitesimal order in a gyro guidance system might send a space probe to the wrong planet , millions of miles off the track . <P> The New Answer . The waves of krypton 86 have none of these failings . They can not be lost , destroyed , damaged or stolen ( there is krypton in all air ) , and scientists believe that their length , which is determined by the properties of the krypton 86 atom , will never change at all . Anyone with the proper equipment ( present cost about $100,000 ) can reproduce , even a million years from now , the standard unit of length adopted in 1960 . By use of an interferometer-an optical device that counts wave lengths and fractions of them-the new light standard gives measurements accurate to one part in 100 million . This , think the metrologists , should suffice for quite a while . <P>        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
