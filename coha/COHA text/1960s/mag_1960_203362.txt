Who called the Geneva test-ban conference ? <P> <P> On Aug. 22 , 1958 President Eisenhower announced the suspension of U.S. nuclear tests as of Oct. 31 , 1958 , and invited the U.S.S.R. to a test-ban conference in Geneva . <P> <P> For what reason ? <P> <P> The Eisenhower Administration conceived a test-ban treaty as a possible step toward controlled general disarmament . In 1955-57 , when Russian propagandists were clamoring for a ban , President Eisenhower insisted that he would negotiate one only as a part of a larger package , including a halt in production of nuclear materials for weapons purposes , and other steps toward disarmament . <P> <P> Why is the U.S. now discussing a ban apart from disarmament ? <P> <P> President Eisenhower and Secretary of State Herter hope that a test-ban treaty will be a " first step " toward disarmament . One of the biggest obstacles to any disarmament agreement with Russia is an almost paranoid Soviet wariness toward Western inspection and control proposals . Eisenhower and Herter think that if a test-ban control system could be negotiated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on disarmament control problems . <P> <P> When did the U.S. stop nuclear tests ? <P> <P> On Oct. 30 , at the end of the Hardtack test series in Nevada . The series included three underground tests of various sizes . <P> Did the U.S.S.R. also suspend nuclear testing ? Not right away . It carried out a series of tests in the fall of 1958 , which scientists agreed were very " dirty " - meaning that they created a lot of radioactive fallout . This was several weeks after the start of the Geneva Conference . As far as the U.S. knows , the U.S.S.R. has not done any testing since then . <P> <P> What would the U.S. gain from a test-ban agreement ? <P> <P> The stopping of all above-ground tests by Russia and Britain ( as well as the U.S. , of course ) and perhaps some progress toward making outer space off limits for nuclear shots . President Eisenhower and Secretary Herter also believe that it would be good to get the nuclear rules set up before other nations begin to manufacture nuclear weapons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the U.S. Senate ? <P> <P> Yes , by a two-thirds majority . <P> <P> Would the U.S. lose any of its present bombs by the treaty ? <P> <P> No . <P> <P> How many bombs does the U.S. have ? <P> <P> The number is classified , but the U.S. <P> does have a widely diversified and dependable " family " of bombs and warheads . <P> These range from small , low-yield , lightweight weapons used by ground and naval forces to the big H-bombs carried by B-52s . Furthermore , there are nuclear devices for antisubmarine warfare , antiaircraft , air-to-air missiles and intercontinental missiles . <P> <P> Do the bombs and warheads deteriorate ? <P> <P> No , they need maintenance but they remain lethal . <P> <P> Is the U.S. supply enough to obliterate Russia ? <P> <P> Many times over . <P> <P> Would the treaty banning above-surface tests injure development of further big bombs ? <P> <P> It is generally conceded that the U.S. has all the big bombs it needs . <P> <P> Would the stopping of U.S. underground tests hamper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
