Even in an affluent middle-class suburb , the modern , modular , $1,500,000 medical building would stand out . Along its cool white corridors hangs a collection of paintings that phase from photographic realism to violent impressionism . But many of the paintings , done by artists living in the neighborhood the medical building serves , are tinged with bitterness against white authority and the Government . For the building is the new Watts Health Center , smack in the middle of " Charcoal Alley , " scene of the fiery Negro riots of 1965 . <P> That the building exists at all is no less a miracle than Watts 's riotless history in the two intervening years . Perhaps even more of a miracle is Dr. Elsie Giorgi , the dark-haired , 56-year-old dynamo who conceived the center and fought it through-despite threats of violence-to fruition . <P> Bronx to Park Avenue . The tenth child of an Italian immigrant family in The Bronx , N.Y. , Dr. Giorgi ( pronounced Georgy ) decided in grammar school that she wanted to become a doctor . Penniless when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College in the depths of the Depression , she toiled twelve years as a white-collar worker in a trucking company , saving $12,000 while helping the firm increase sixfold in size . Then , after four years at Columbia 's College of Physicians and Surgeons , she spent ten years as intern , resident and ultimately chief of clinics at the Cornell Division of New York City 's Bellevue Hospital Center , and built up a flourishing Park Avenue practice . <P> " I was n't comfortable with it , " she says . " Eighty-five percent of the people had nothing wrong with them physically . They were simply troubled . " In 1961 Dr. Giorgi moved to Los Angeles for a year 's residency in psychiatry at Los Angeles Cedars-Sinai Medical Center , in turn taking over the center 's clinic and establishing its comprehensive home-care program-and a movie-star-studded practice of her own . In July 1965 , she volunteered to examine Watts children who were beginning the Office of Economic Opportunity 's Head Start program , and was appalled . <P> " The ratio of doctors to patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " The infant-mortality rate was almost double the overall U.S. rate . Sixty-eight percent of the children I examined had something wrong with them . Ninety percent had never seen a dentist . " <P> " Your Clinic Will Burn . " Furious , Dr. Giorgi stormed into the OEO 's offices in Washington with a plan for a medical center outlined on a piece of note paper . OEO bought the idea , and within a year , through the University of Southern California 's medical school , had funded the new Watts Health Center . Built on land leased from Los Angeles for $1 a year , the center was opened last month . At the dedication ceremony , a young firebrand of Watts 's Black Power movement introduced Dr. Giorgi to the crowd . As she mounted the podium , the young man threw his arms around her , kissed her , then whispered , grinning , " I hope you did n't mind , Doctor , but I know there are TV cameras here and I wanted them to see that in Mississippi .
