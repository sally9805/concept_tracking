How do you " correct " a candidate 's lack of warmth ? When does he need " more memorable phrases " ? How do you " create an image without saying anything " ? These are just a few of the considerations that went into Nixon 's campaign-at the heart of which was the adroit manipulation and use of television . He was afraid of television . He knew his soul - was hard to find . Beyond that , he considered it a gimmick ; its use in politics offended him . It had not been part of the game when he had learned to play , he could see no reason to bring it in now . He half-suspected it was an Eastern liberal trick ; one more way to make him look silly . It offended his sense of dignity , one of the truest senses he had . So his decision to use it to become President in 1968 was not easy . So much of him argued against it . But in his Wall Street years , Richard Nixon had traveled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was , as in the Graham Greene title , a burnt-out case . All feeling was behind him ; the machine inside had proved his hardiest part . He would run for President again and if he would have to learn television to run well , then he would learn it . Nixon gathered about himself a group of young men attuned to the political uses of television . They arrived at his side by different routes . One , William Gavin , was a thirty-oneyear-old English teacher in a suburban high school outside Philadelphia in 1967 when he wrote Richard Nixon a letter urging him to run for President and base his campaign on TV . Gavin wrote the letter on stationery borrowed from the University of Pennsylvania because he thought Nixon would pay more attention-if the letter seemed to be from a college professor . Dear Mr. Nixon : May I offer two suggestions conce ? - ning your plans for 1968 ? 1 . Run . You can win . Nothing can happen to you , politically speaking , that is worse than what has happened to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Masses says : " These ideas are the only genuine ideas ; the ideas of the shipwrecked . All the rest is rhetoric , posturing , farce . He ioho does not really feel himself lost . is lost without remission . " You , in effect , are " lost " ; that is why you are the only politicol .

Run . Y o --  , will win . 2 . A tip for television : instead of those wooden performances beloved by politicians , instead of a glamor boy technique , instead of safety , be bold . Why not have live press conferences as your campaign on television ? People will see you daring all , asking and answering questions rom. reporters , and not simply answe ? ' ing phony " questions " made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be daring . Instead of the medium using you , you would be using the medium .. , Television hurt you because you were not yourself- it did n't hurt the " real " Nixon . The real Nixon can revolutionize the use of television by dynamically going " live " and answering everything , the loaded and the unloaded question . Invite YO-tropponents to this kind of debate . Good luck , and I know you can win if you see yourself for wha ; t you are ; a man who has been beaten , humiliated , hated , but whu can still . see the truth . A Nixon staff member had lunch with Gavin a couple of times after the letter was received and hired him . Gavin began churning out long , stream-of-consciousness memos which dealt mostly with the importance of image , and ways in which Richard Nixon , through television , could acquire a good one : " Voters are basically lazy , basically uninterested in making an effort . to understand what were talking about , " Gavin wrote . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; impression is easier . Reason pushes the viewer back , it assaults him . . , . The emotions are more easily roused , closer to the surface , more malleable .... " So , for the New Hampshire primary , Gavin recommended " saturation with a film , in which the candidate can be shown better than he can be shown in person because it can be edited , so only the best moments are shown .... Nixon has to come across as a person larger than life , the stuff of legend . People are stirred by legend , in. eluding the living legend , not by the man himself . Its the aura that surrounds the charismatic figure more than it is the figure itself that draws the followers . Our task is to build that aura .... " William Gavin was brought to the White House as a speechwriter in January of 1969 . Harry Treleaven , hired as creative director of advertising in the fall of 1967 , immediately went to work on the more serious of Nixon 's personality problems . One was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree , " Treleaven wrote , " but lets not be too obvious about it . Romney 's cornball attempts have hurt him . If were going to be witty , let a pro write the words . " Treleaven also worried about Nixon 's lack of warmth , but decided : " He can be helped greatly in this respect by how he is handled .... Give him word ? to say that will show his emotional involvement in the issues .... He should be presented in some kind of ' situation ' rather than cold in a studio . The situation should look unstaged even if its not . " Some of the most effective ideas belonged to Raymond K. Price , a former editorial writer for the New York Herald Tribune , who became Nixon 's best and most prominent speechwriter in the campaign . Price later composed much of the Inaugural Address . In 1967 , he concluded that rational arguments would " only be effective if we can get the people to make the emotional leap , or what theologians call leap of faith . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal factors " rather than the " historical factors " which were the basis of the low opinion so many people had of Richard Nixon . " These tend to be more a gut reaction , " he wrote , " unarticulated , nonanalytical , a product of the particular chemistry between the voter and the image of the candidate . We have to be very clear on this point : that the response is to the image , not to the man .... " , So there would not have to be a " new Nixon . " Simply a new approach to television . This was how they went into it . Trying , with one hand , to build the illusion that Richard Nixon , in addition to his attributes of mind and heart , considered " communicating with the people ... one of the great joys of seeking the Presidency , " while with the other they shielded him , controlled him , and controlled the atmosphere around him . It was as if they were building not a President but an Astrodome , where the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the ball never bounce erratically on the arti ficial grass . And it worked . As he moved serenely through his primary campaign , there was new cadence to Richard Nixon 's speech and . motion ; new confidence in his heart . And , a new image of him on the television screen , on live , but controlled , TV . Ifirst , met Harry Treleaven on a rainy morn- ing in June of 1968 , in his New York office at Fuller and Smith and Ross , the advertising agency . Treleaven was small and thin . He had . gray hair and the tight frowning mouth that you see on the assistant principal of a high school . He seemed to be in his middle forties . He looked like William Scranton . Treleaven , it turned out , did not work for Fuller and Smith and Ross . He worked for Richard Nixon . Fuller and Smith and Ross was only incidental to the campaign . An agency was needed to do the mechanics-buying the television time and the newspaper space-and this looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not being permitted to do creative work . Treleaven had been born in Chicago and had gone to Duke University , where he was Phi Beta Kappa . After that , he moved to Los Angeles and worked on the Los Angeles Times and then wrote radio scripts . One night he and his wife were having dinner in a restaurant in Los Angeles with a couple he did not like . Halfway through the meal he turned to his wife . " Do you like it here ? " " You mean the restaurant ? " " I mean Los Angeles . " " No , not especially . " " Then lets go . " And Harry Treleaven threw a $20 bill on the table and he and his wife walked out . He took a plane to New York that night and found a job with the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency . He stayed with Thompson eighteen years . When he left it was as a vice president . He did commercials for Pan American , RCA , Ford , and Lark cigarettes , among others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day in September of 1967 , drinking a can of beer . A summer neighbor named Len Garment , who was a partner in the law firm where Richard Nixon worked , approached him . Harry Treleaven knew Garment from a meeting they had had earlier in the summer . Garment had vaguely mentioned something about Treleaven and the advertising needs of the Richard Nixon campaign . Now he was more specific . He offered Treleaven a job . Creative director of advertising . Treleaven would devise a theme for the campaign , create commercials to fit the theme , and seethat they were produced with a maximum of skill , Len Garments office was on the third floor of Nixon headquarters , at Park Avenue and 57th Street . A man named Jim Howard , a public-relations man from Cleveland , was with him the day I came in . Jim Howard was talking to Wilt Chamberlain on the phone . " Wilt , I understand your position but they just do n't pay that kind of money . " Garment was a short , pudgy man , also in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Woody Herman band . He had voted for John Kennedy in 1960 . Then he met Nixon at the law firm . He was chief of litigation and he was making money but he hated the job . He found that Nixon was not so bad a guy and very smart . When Nixon asked him to work in the Presidential campaign , he said yes . He had been practically the first person to be hired and now he was chief recruiter . Jim Howard had been trying to get Wilt Chamberlain to appear on the Mike Douglas show for free . The idea was for Chamberlain to explain why Richard Nixon should be President . Chamberlain was the only Negro celebrity they had and they were trying to get him around . The problem was , the Douglas show did not pay . And Chamberlain wanted money , Len Garment started to explain the Nixon approach to advertising . Or the Garment-Treleaven approach to advertising Nixon . The big thing is to stay away from gimmicks , " he said . " Right , " Jim Howard said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not feel comfortable wearing . You ca n't sell the candidate like a product , " he said . " A product , all you want to do is get attention . You only need " 2 per cent additional buyers to make the campaign worthwhile . In politics you need a flat 51 per cent of the market and you ca n't get that through gimmicks . " Two weeks later , I met Frank Shakespeare . Treleaven , Garment ( who this June became special consultant to the President in the area of civil rights ) , and Shakespeare mad ? up what was to be called the media and advertising group . But of the three equals , Shakespeare was quickly becoming more equal than the others . He had come from CBS . He , too , was in his forties , with blond hair and a soft , boyish face , When he was named director of the United States Information Agency , after Nixon 's election , aNew York Times profile reported that , although he had spent eighteen years at CBS , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about him . He was working for free because his progress at CBS had been stalled when Jim Aubrey got fired . He had been one of Aubrey 's boys . Now , it was said , he was trying to give his career some outside impetus . An association with the President of the U. S. could hardly hurt . O n the morning after the Russians invaded Czechoslovakia , Harry Treleaven got to his office early . He was in an exceptionally good mood . The invasion had proved Nixon was right all along . The Russians had not changed . " Makes it kind of hard to be a dove , does n't it ? " he said , smiling . Treleaven was leaving for Teletape , the film-editing studio , right away . The day before , he had cut Nixon 's forty-five-minute acceptance speech to thirty minutes , and he wanted to see it . Len Garment was at the studio when Treleaven got there . " What about this Czech things he said . He looked really worried . Treleaven smiled . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive side . " " Well , yes , " Garment said . " I think it will bring a restoration of realism to American political discussion . " But Treleaven just perfect . It puts the soft-liners in a hell of a box ! " Harry Treleaven had used the CBS tape of the acceptance speech to make the commercial . " Better camera angles , " he explained . And besides , NBC has a peculiar form of editorializing . For instance , they 'll cut to some young colored guy who 's not applauding while Nixon talks of bridges to human dignity . " In the beginning of the acceptance speech , Richard Nixon had made a sweeping motion with his arm and shouted , " Let 's win this one for Ike ! " and all the Republicans cheered . Harry Treleaven had cut this line from the speech . " Good , " Shakespeare said , " very good , Harry . That 's the one line Rose Mary Woods wanted out of there . " Rose Mary Woods was Richard Nixon 's secretary . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she emerged in 1968 as an adviser , too . Another thing he had cut was a reference . to the era of negotiation " with the Russians . Shakespeare was very happy this had gone . It would have been awful , he thought-they all thought-to have a reference to negotiations now that this invasion had occurred . This was the Cold War again , and adrenalin was flowing . A big meeting was scheduled at Fuller and Smith and Ross for lunchtime . The agency had ordered ham sandwiches with a lot of lettuce and big pots of coffee . Everyone sat down and took little bites out of their sandwiuhes while Frank Shakespeare stood up and talked . Already , there was bad feeling between the agency people and the Nixon group . In the beginning , the agency had believed it actually was going to create commercials . Then Harry Treleaven walked in . Without even saying good morning . Now the agency was making money but it was embarrassed . Treleaven would not tell them what he was doing . No need to , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , and rather than rush something new into production he would prefer to continue the sixty-second excerpts from the acceptance speech that had been running as radio commercials . Art Duram , the president of the agency , immediately lit his pipe . But your exposure on that speech- " he said . " You 're going to be horrendously overexposed . " " I 'm not sure that 's bad , Art , " Treleaven said . " He 's saying some awfully good things . " But psychologically- " " Well , the problem is we have nothing else to use and there 's nothing else we could have ready that quickly unless it were a real emergency and I just do n't think it is . " Duram shrugged . Then a red-haired lady named Ruth Jones spoke up from the other side of the table . She had been hired by Shakespeare to supervise the buying of television and radio time for the commercials . " Nixon should go on the air tonight with a special broadcast about Czechoslovakia , " she said . Shakespeare shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . He could n't get ready . He 's better off not saying anything . He 's been Mr. Cool and Mr. Calm through this whole thing . " Ruth Jones shrugged . " I still think he should do it , " she said . " But let 's move on to something else-we 're going to get bold listings in the Times starting immediately . " " Bold listings ? " Shakespeare asked . " Yes , in the TV section . Listing our commercials in bold type in the schedule . They had been doing it for McCarthy and not for us . But 1 tossed a couple of hand grenades . At the networks and the Times . And 1 got immediate results . " Then a man walked into the room with a big ; colored poster under his arm . The poster was a closeup of Richard Nixon smiling . Beneath it were the words : THIS TIME VOTE LIKE YOUR WHOLE WORLD DEPENDED ON IT . " This is the new slogan , " he said . " And together with the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Magazine and on our billboards . " Frank Shakespeare was staring at the picture . " Do you like the photograph ? " he said , turning toward Len Garment . " I have a little bit of a problem with that tre mendous smile , tied in with the serious line , " Garment said . The man with the poster was nodding . " We 're still looking for the right picture , " he said , " and its difficult . But this expression is not a laugh to me . Its a youthful expression . It has vitality . To look at it inspires confidence . The picture has sensitivity , and one of the reasons we ran the line behind him-in back of his head-is so he would n't appear to be speaking it . See , its there , but just as part of the image . The connection is not direct . " " Yes , " Frank Shakespeare said . " All right . " " It will make a tremendous billboard , " Tre-leaven said . " There 's character in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best-looking candidate , no doubt about it , " Treleaven said . " So its a cheerful , grim , serious , and optimistic picture , " Len Garment said , smiling . " And youthful , " Shakespeare added . " Ah , " said Ruth Jones , who still wanted him to speak on Czechoslovakia , " a man for all seasons . " Then they talked about fund-raising . " The first McCarthy telecast raised a hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars , " Ruth Jones said . " Who gave the pitch ? " Shakespeare asked . " Paul Newman . " " Oh , well , that made a difference . " " It was a personal involvement pitch . Dick Goodwin wrote it for him . " " We 'll use the same pitch , " Shakespeare said , " but we do n't have as strong a man . " " Who do we have ? " " Bud Wilkinson . " Atfour o'clock , Treleaven walked to a West Side theater to look at a film that had been made with Spiro Agnew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican convention . " It could be a great help , particularly with Agnew , if its any good , " Treleaven said . Shakespeare and Garment already were at the theater . So was the man who had made the films -a TV documentary man whom Shakespeare had hired especially for this job . He was wearing sneakers and shifting nervously from foot to foot . There were two separate films , each con taining an interview with one of the candidates . The Agnew film was shown first . It had been shot in color , with sailboats in the blue bay as a backdrop . Spiro Agnew was squinting in the sun . " All life , " he said , " is essentially the con-tributions that come from compromise . " His voice was sleepy , his face without expression . The questions fit right in . " It must have really been a thrill to have been picked for Vice President . Were you happy ? " " The ability to be happy is directly propor tional to the ability to suffer , " Agnew said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence , " and as you grow older you feel everything less . " He stopped . There was silence on the film . Then the voice of the interviewer : " I see . " " Jesus Christ , " someone said out loud in the dark little theater . Spiro Agnew 's face kept moving in and out of focus . " Is that the projector or the film ? " Garment asked . The man who had made the film disappeared into the projection booth . The technical quality of the film did not improve . " Loyalty is the most important principle , " Agnew was saying , " when coupled with honesty , that is . And 1 think that such values are in danger when you hear people advocate violence to change situations which are intolerable ... and most of the people who are cutting the United States up are doing so without offering a single concrete proposal to improve it . " " How did you become a Republican ? " " I became a Republican out of hero worship . " Then Spiro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man in the law office where he had first worked as a clerk , and how the old man had been a Republican and how he had admired the old man so much that he had become a Republican too . There was more silence on the film . The focus was very bad . " And ... and ... you just sort of went on becoming more and more Republican ? " " That 's right , " Spiro Agnew said . More silence . The sailboats moved slowly in the back-ground . The water was very blue . Then the focus made everything a blur . " What a heartbreak , " the man who had made the films said , standing in the back of the theater . ? ' It looks like you 're looking through a Coke bottle , " Garment said . " And he comes across as such an utter bore , " Treleaven said . " I do n't think the man has had an original observation in his life . " " He is rather non-dynamic , " Garment said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theater . " We ca n't use any of this , " he said . " That picture quality is awful . Just awful . And Agnew himself , my God . He says all the wrong things . " " What we need is a shade less truth and a little more pragmatism , " Treleaven said . " I think Dexedrine is the answer , " Garment said . am not going to barricade myself into a television studio and make this an antiseptic campaign , " Richard Nixon said at a press conference a few days after his nomination . Then he went to Chicago to open his fall campaign . The whole day was built around a television show . Even when ten thousand people stood in front of his hotel and screamed for him to greet them he stayed locked up in his room , resting for the show . ' Chicago was the site for the first of ten programs that Nixon would do in states ranging from Massachusetts to Texas . The idea was to have him in the middle of a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had developed the idea through the primaries and now had it sharpened to a point . Each show would run for one hour . It would be live to provide suspense ; there would be a studio audience to cheer Nixon 's answers and make it seem to home viewers that enthusiasm for his candidacy was all but uncontrollable ; and there would be an effort to achieve a conversational tone that would penetrate Nixon 's stuffiness and drive out the displeasure he often seemed to feel when surrounded by other human beings instead of Bureau of the Budget reports . One of the valuable things about this idea , from a political standpoint , was that each show would be seen only by the people who lived in that particular state or region . This meant it made no difference if Nixon 's statements-for they were not really answers-were exactly the same , phrase for phrase , gesture for gesture , from state to state . Only the press would be bored and the press had been written off already . So Nixon could get through the campaign with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problems of America in 1968 . Roger Ailes , the executive producer of the Mike Douglas show , was hired to produce the one-hour programs . Ailes was twenty-eight years old . He had started as a prop boy on the Douglas show in 1965 and was running it within three years . He was good . When he left , Douglas ' ratings declined . But not everyone he passed on his way up remained his friend . Not even Douglas . Richard Nixon had been a guest on the show in the fall of 1967 . While waiting to go on , he fell into conversation with Roger Ailes . " It 's a shame a man has to use gimmicks like this to get elected , " Nixon said . " Television is not a gimmick , " Ailes said . Richard Nixon liked that kind of thinking . He told Len Garment to hire the man . Ailes had been sent to Chicago three days before Nixon opened the fall campaign . His instructions were to select a panel of questioners and design a set . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only six hours , in fact , before it was to begin , Ailes was having problems . " Those stupid bastards on the set-designing crew put turquoise curtains in the background . Nixon would n't look right unless he was carrying a pocketbook . " Ailes ordered the curtains removed and three plain , almost stark wooden boards to replace them . " The wood has clean , solid , masculine lines , " he said . His biggest problem was with the panel of questioners . Shakespeare , Treleaven , and Garment had felt it essential to have a " balanced " group . First , this meant a Negro . One Negro . Not two . Two would be offensive to whites , perhaps to Negroes as well . Two would be trying too hard . One was necessary and safe . Fourteen per cent of the population applied to a six- or seven-member panel equaled one . Texas would be tricky , though . Do you have a Negro and a Mexican-American , or if not , then which ? Besides the Negro , the panel for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Polish-Hungarian group , a suburban housewife , a businessman , a representative of the white lower middle class , and , for authenticity , two newsmen : one from Chicago , one from Moline . That was all right , Roger Ailes said . But then someone had called from New York and insisted that he add a farmer . Roger Ailes had been born in Ohio , but even so he knew you did not want a farmer on a television show . All they did was ask complicated questions about things like parities , which nobody else understood or cared about . Including Richard Nixon . Besides , the farmer brought the panel size to eight , which Ailes said was too big . It would be impossible for Nixon to establish interpersonal relationships with eight different people in one hour . And interpersonal relationships were the key to success . " This is the trouble with . all these political people horning in , " Ailes said . " Fine , they all get their lousy little groups represented but we wind up with a horseshit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred people-recruited by the local Republi-can organization . Just enough Negroes so the press could not write " all-white " stories but not enough so it would look like a ball park . The audience , of course , would applaud every answer Richard Nixon gave , boosting his confidence and giving the impression to a viewer that Nixon certainly did have charisma , and whatever other qualities they wanted their President to have . Treleaven and his assistant , Al Scott , came to the studio late in the afternoon . They were getting nervous . " Nixon 's throat is scratchy , " Treleaven said , " and that 's making him upset . " Al Scott did not like the lighting in the studio . " The lights are too high , " he said . " They 'll show the bags under RN 's eyes . " Then there was a crisis about whether the press should be allowed in the studio during the show . Shakespeare had given an order that they be kept out . Now they were complaining to Herb Klein , the press-relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to cheer , a pool of two or three reporters could be allowed to sit in the stands . Shakespeare still said no . No neuiepapermen. were going to interfere with his TV show . Klein kept arguing , saying that if this was how it was going to start , on the very first day of the cam-paign , it was going to be 1960 again within a week . Treleaven and Ailes went upstairs , to the WBBM cafeteria , and drank vending-machine coffee from paper cups . " I agree with Frank , " Ailes said . " It 's not a press conference . " " But if you let the audience in " " Does n't matter . The audience is part of the show . And that 's the whole point . Its a television show . Our television show . And the press has no business on the set . " God dam it , Harry , the problem is that this is an electronic election . The first there 's ever been . TV has the power now . Some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and then the reporters get pissed and go out of their way to rap anything they consider staged for TV . And you know damn well that 's what they 'd do if they saw this from the studio . You let them in with the regular audience and they see the warm-up . They see Jack Rourke out there telling the audience to applaud and to mob Nixon at the end , and that 's all they 'd write about . You know damn well it is . " Jack Rourke was Roger Ailes 's assistant . " I 'm still afraid well create a big incident if we lock them out entirely , " Treleaven said . " I 'm going to call Frank and suggest he reconsider . " But Shakespeare would not . He arranged for monitors in an adjacent studio and said the press could watch from there , seeing no more , no less , than what they would see from any living room in It was five o'clock now ; the show was to start at nine . Ray Vojey , the makeup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , Ray , " Roger Ailes said , " with Wilkinson , watch that perspiration problem on the top of his forehead . " " Yes , he went a little red in Portland , " Ray Vojey said . " And when he 's off camera , rd give him a treated towel , just like Mr. Nixon uses . " " Right . " Ailes turned to Jack Rourke , the assistant . " Also , rd like to have Wilkinson in the room with Nixon before the show to kibitz around , get Nixon loose . " " Okay , I 'll bring him in . " The set , now that it was finished , was impressive . There was a round blue-carpeted platform , six feet in diameter and eight inches high . Richard Nixon would stand on this and face the panel , which would be seated in a semicircle around him . Bleachers for the audience ranged out behind the panel chairs . Later , Roger Ailes would think to call the whole effect " the arena concept " and bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He got this from a Theodore Roosevelt quote which hung , framed , from a wall of his office in Philadelphia . It said something about how one man in the arena was worth ten , or a hundred , or a thousand carping critics . At nine o'clock , Central Daylight Time , Richard Nixon , freshly powdered , left his dressing room , walked down a corridor deserted save for Secret Service , and went through a carefully guarded doorway that opened on the rear of the set . Harry Treleaven had selected tape from WBBM 's coverage of the noontime motorcade for the opening of the show . Tape that showed Richard Nixon riding , arms outstretched , beaming , atop an open car . Hundreds of thousands of citizens , some who had come on their own , some who had been recruited by Republican organizations , cheered , waved balloons , and tossed confetti in the air . One week before , at the Democratic convention , it had been Humphrey , blood , and tear gas . Today it was Nixon , the unifying hero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed a warm , assured , united front . And Harry Treleaven picked only the most magical of moments for the opening of his television show . Then the director hit a button and Bud Wilkinson appeared on the screen , a placid , composed , substantial , reassuring figure introducing his close personal friend , a man whose intelligence and judgment had won the respect of the world 's leaders and the admiration of millions of his countrymen , this very same man who had been seen entering Jerusalem moments ago on tape : Richard Nixon . And the carefully cued audience ( for Jack Rourke had done his job well ) stood to render an ovation . Richard Nixon , grinning , waving , thrusting , walked to the blue riser to receive the tribute . It was warmly given . Genuine . He looked toward his wife ; the two daughters ; Senator Ed Brooke , the most useful Negro he had found ; Charles Percy , the organization man ; and Senator Thruston Morton , resigned if not enthusiastic . They sat in the first row together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the platform for company , ready to face , if not the nation , at least Illinois . To communicate , man to man , eye to eye , with that mass of the ordinary whose concerns he so deeply shared , whose values were so totally his o ? vn.All the subliminal effects sank in . Nixon stood alone , ringed by forces which , if not hostile , were at least-to the viewer-unpredictable . There was a rush of sympathy ; a desire -- a need , even-to root . Richard Nixon was suddenly human : facing a new and dangerous situation , alone , armed with only his wits . In image terms , he had won before he began . All the old concepts had been destroyed . He had achieved a new level of communication . The stronger his statement , the stronger the surge of warmth inside the viewer . Morris Liebman , the Jewish attorney , asked the first question : " Would you comment On the accusation which was made from time to time that your views have shifted and that they are based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I suppose what you are referring to is : Is there a new Nixon or is there an old Nixon ? I suppose I could counter by saying : Which Humphrey shall we listen to today ? " There was great applause for this . When it faded , Richard Nixon said , " I do want to say this : There certainly is a new Nixon . I realize , too , that as a man gets older he learns something . If I have n't learned something I am not worth anything in public life .... I think my principles are consistent . I believe very deeply in the American system . I believe very deeply in what is needed to defend that system at home and abroad . I think I have some ideas as to how we can promote peace , ideas that are different from what they were eight years ago , not because I have changed but because the problems have changed .

In terms of what I believe in , the American view and the American dream , I think I am just what I was eight years ago . " Applause swept the studio . Bud Wilkinson joined in . The farmer asked a question about farming . The Polish-Hungarian delivered an address concerning the problems of the people of Eastern Europe . His remarks led to no question at all , but no matter : Richard Nixon expressed concern for the plight of Eastern Europeans everywhere , including Northern Illinois . Then Warner Saunders , the Negro , and a very acceptable , very polite one he seemed to be , asked , " What does law and order mean to you T " " I am quite aware , " Richard Nixon said , " of the fact that the black community , when they hear it , think of power being used in a way that is destructive to them , . and yet I think we , have to also remember that the black community as well as the white community has an interest in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ....

Nixon said , " Of all the men who I considered , Spiro Agnew had the intelligence , the courage , and the principle to take on the great responsibilities of a campaigner and responsibilities of Vice President . " McCarter came back later wanting to know if Nixon thought the Chicago police had been too harsh on demonstrators in the streets . " It would be easy , " Nixon said , " to criticize Mayor Daley and by implication Vice President Humphrey . But it would n't be right for me to lob in criticism . I am not going to get into it . It is best for political figures not to be making partisan comments from the sidelines . " The show went on like that . At the end the audience charged from the bleachers , as instructed . They swarmed around Richard Nixon so that the last thing the viewer at home saw was Nixon in the middle of this big crowd of people , who all thought he was great . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought the show had been brilliant . He got to Nixonjust as Nixon was bending down to autograph a cast that a girl had on her leg . " Well , you 've got a leg up , " Treleaven said . Nixon stood up and grinned and moved away . " Gee , that was sure a funny look he gave me , " Treleaven said . " I wonder if he heard me . I wonder if he knew who I was . " Originally , Treleaven had wanted David Douglas Duncan , the photographer , to make commercials . Duncan was a friend of Richard Nixon 's but when Treleaven took him out to lunch he said no , he would be too busy . Then Duncan mentioned Eugene Jones . Treleaven wanted Duncan because he had decided to make still photography the basis of Richard Nixon 's sixty-second television commercial campaign . He had learned a little about stills at J. Walter Thompson when he had used them for some Pan American spots . Now he thought they were the perfect thing for Nixon because Nixon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the same ones Nixon always used-the words of the acceptance speech . But they would all seem fresh and lively because a series of still pictures would flash on the screen while Nixon spoke . If it were done right , it would permit Treleaven to create a Nixon image that was entirely independent of words . Obviously , some technical skill would be required . David Douglas Duncan said Gene Jones was the man . Treleaven met Jones and was impressed . " He 's low-key , " Treleaven said . " He does n't come at you as a know-it-all . " Gene Jones , who was in his early forties , had been taking movies of wars half his life . He did it perhaps as well as any man ever has . Besides that , he had produced the Today show on NBC for two years and had done a documentary series on famous people called The World of-Billy Graham , Sophia Loren , anyone who had been famous and was willing to be surrounded by Jones 's cameras for a month . Jones understood perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nixon would seem to be contemporary , imaginative , involved-without having to say anything of substance . Jones had never done commercial work before but for $110,000 , from which he would pay salaries to a nine-man staff , he said he would do it for Nixon . A day or two later Jones came down to Treleaven 's office to discuss details such as where he should set up a studio and what areas the first set of spots should cover . " This will not be a commercial sell , " Jones said . " It will not have the feel of something a-pardon the expressionan agency would turn out . I see it as sort of a miniature Project 20 . And I ca n't see anyone turning it off a television set , quite frankly . " That same day Jones rented two floors of the building at 303 East 53rd Street in Manhattan , one flight up from a nightclub called Chuck 's Composite . Within three days , he had his staff at work . Buying pictures , taking pictures , taking motion pictures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sequence . " I 'm pretty excited about this , " Jones said . think we can give it an artistic dimension . " Harry Treleaven did not get excited about anything but he was at least intrigued by this . " It will be interesting to see how he translates his approach into political usefulness , " Treleaven said . " Yes , " Frank Shakespeare said , " if he can . " Gene Jones would start work at five o'clock in the morning . Laying coffee and doughnuts on his desk , he would spread a hundred or so pictures on the floor , taken from boxes into which his staff already had filed them . The boxes had labels like VIETNAM ? ? ? DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION POVERTY : . HARLFM , CITY SLUMS , GHETTOS ... FACES : HAPPY AMERICAN PEOPLE AT WORK He would select a category to fit the first line of whatever script he happened to be working with that day . He would select the most appropriate of the pictures , and then arrange and rearrange , as in a game of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted he would work with a stopwatch and red pencil , marking each picture on the back to indicate what sort of angle and distance the movie camera should shoot from and how long it should linger on each still . " The secret is in juxtaposition , " Jones said . " The relationships , the arrangement . After twenty-five years , the other things-the fram-ing and the panning-c-are easy . " Everyone was excited about the technique and the way it could be used to make people feel that Richard Nixon belonged in the White House . The only person who was not impressed was Nixon . He was in a hotel room in San Francisco one day recording the words for one of the early commercials . The machine was turned on before Nixon realized it and the end of his conversation was picked up . " I 'm not sure I like this kind of a . , . format , incidentally , " Nixon said . " Ah ... I 've seen these kind of things and I do n't think they 're very ... very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been told to read . In the afternoons , Treleaven , Garment , and Shakespeare would go to Gene Jones 's studio to look at the spots on a little machine called a Movieola.lf they were approved , Jones would take them to a sound studio dOW11the street to blend in music , but they never were approved right away . There was not one film that Garment or Shakespeare did not order changed for a " political " reason . Anything that might offend ' Strom Thurmond , that might annoy the Wallace voter whom Nixon was trying so hard for ; any ethnic nuance that Jones , in his preoccupation with artistic viewpoint , might have missed : these came out . " Gene is good , " Treleaven explained , " but he needs a lot of political guidance . He does n't always seem to be aware of the point we 're trying to make . " Jones did n't like the changes . " I 'm not an apprentice , " he said . " I 'm an experienced pro and never before in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to change this and change that . When you pull out a shot or two it destroys the dynamism , the whole flow . " The first spot was called simply VIETNAM . Gene Jones had been there for ninety days , under fire , watching men kill and die and he had been wounded in the neck himself . Out of the experience had come A Face of War . And out of it now came E.S.J. for Eugene S. Jones #1 , designed to help Richard Nixon become President . Harry Treleaven and Len Garment and Frank Shakespeare thought this commercial splendid . " Wow , that 's powerful , " Treleaven said . The fourth of the ten scheduled panel shows was done in Philadelphia . It was televised across Pennsylvania and into Delaware and New Jersey . Roger Ailes arrived in Philadelphia on Wednesday , September 18 , two days before the show was to go on the air . " We 're doing all right , " he said . " If we could only get someone to play Hide the Greek . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Philadelphia show was held at ten o'clock Thursday morning in the office of Al Hollender , program director of WCAU . The purpose was to acquaint the local staff with what Roger Ailes wanted to do and to acquaint Roger Ailes with the limitations of the local staff . Ailes came in ten minutes late , dressed in sweat shirt and sneakers , coffee cup in hand . He had a room at the Marriott Motor Hotel across the street . " One problem you 're going to have here , Roger , " a local man said , " is the size of the studio . You 've been working with an audience of three hundred , I understand , but we can only fit 240 . " " That 's all right . I can get as much applause out of 240 as three hundred , if it 's done right , and that 's all they are-an applause machine . " He paused . " That and a couple of reaction shots . " " I 'm more concerned , " Ailes said , " about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice about playing to it and I ca n't seem to get through to him . So I think this time were going to play it to him . " " You ought to talk to him about saying , ' Let me make one thing very clear , ten times every show , " someone said . " It 's driving people nuts . " " I have , and Shakespeare told me not to mention it again . It bugs Nixon . Apparently everybody has been telling him about it but he ca n't stop . " , After half an hour , Roger Ailes left the meeting . " Those things bore me , " he said . " I 'll leave Rourke to walk around and kick the tires . " He went across the street to the motel . The morning was clear and hot . " The problem with the panels is that we need variety , " Ailes said . " Nixon gets bored with the same kind of people . We 've got to screw around with this one a little bit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , supplied by the local Republicans , asked . . " Yes , and on this one we definitely need a Negro . I do n't think its necessary to have one in every group of six people , no matter what our ethnic experts say , but in Philadelphia it is . U.S. News and World Report this week says that one of every three votes cast in Philadelphia will be Negro . " " I know one in Philadelphia , " the local man , whose name was Dan Boozer , said . " He 's a dynamic type , the head of a self-help organization , that kind of thing . And he is black . " " What do you mean he 's black ? " " I mean he 's dark . It will be obvious on television that he 's not white . " " You mean we wo n't have to put a sign around him that says , This is our Negro ' ? " " Absolutely not . " " Fine . Call him . Les get this thing going . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ailes was saying . " It 's tough to get an articulate ditchdigger , but rd like to . " " I have one name here , " Boozer said . " Might be offbeat . A Pennsylvania Dutch farmer . " " NorNo more farmers . They all ask the same dull questions . " The morning produced an Italian lawyer from Pittsburgh , a liberal housewife from the Main Line , and a Young Republican from the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce . " Now we need a newsman , " Roger Ailes said . I suggested the name of an articulate reporter from the Evening Bulletin in Philadelphia . " Fipe . Why do n't you call him ? " " He 's ' a Negro . " " Oh shit , we ca n't have two . Even in Philadelphia . Wait a minute-call him , and if hem do it we can drop the self-help guy . " But the reporter was unavailable . Then I suggested Jack McKinney , a radio talk-show host from WCAU . Ailes called him and after half an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to believe the show would not be rigged , agreed . to go on.Then I suggested a psychiatrist I knew:the head of a group that brought Vietnamese children wounded in the war to the United States for treatment and artificial limbs . " What 's his name ? " " Herb Needleman . " Roger Ailes called him . Herb Needleman agreed to do the show . Roger Ailes was pleased . " The guy sounded tough but not hysterical . This is shaping up as a very interesting show . " A newsman from Camden , New Jersey , added , and , at four o'clock , Ailes called Len ment in New York to tell him the panel was plete . .. That 's six , " he was saying , " and then we 've got a Jewish doctor from Philadelphia , a psychiatrist , who-wait a minute , Len , relax ... I-yes , not ? Len ? a little feels that hung up . " J esus Christ , " he said . " You 're not going to believe this but Nixon hates psychiatrists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's got this thing , apparently . They make him very nervous . You should have heard Len on the phone when I told him I had one on the panel . Did you hear him ? If I ever heard a guy 'S voice turn white , that was it . " ? whyr " He said he did n't want to go into it . But apparently Nixon wo n't even let one in the same room . Jesus Christ , could you picture him on a live TV show finding out he 's being questioned by a shrink ? " There was another reason , too , why Herb Needleman was unacceptable . " Len says they want to go easy on Jews for a while . I guess Nixon 's tired of saying ' balance of power ' about the goddam Middle East . " So , at 4 : 15 P.M. , Roger Ailes made another call to Dr. Needleman , to tell him that this terribly embarrassing thing had happened , that the show had been overbooked . Something about having to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ televised into the southern part of the state . " You know what I 'd like ? " Ailes said later . " As long as we 've got this extra spot open . A good , mean , Wallaceite cab driver . Would n't that be great ? Some guy to sit there and say , ' Awright Mac , what about these niggers ? ' " It was five o'clock in the afternoon . The day still was hot but Roger Ailes had not been outside since morning . Air conditioning , iced tea , and the telephone . " Come on , " Roger Ailes said . " Let 's go find a cab driver . " He stepped out to the motel parking lot and walked through the sun to the main entrance . The Marriott was the best place they had in Philadelphia . Eight cabs were lined up in the driveway . The third driver Roger Ailes talked to said that he was not really for Wallace , but that he was n't really against him either . " What 's your name ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You want to go on television tomorrow night ? Right across the street there , and ask Mr. Nixon some questions . Any questions you want . " " I 've got to work tomorrow night . " " Take it off . Tell them why . Well pay you for the hours you miss , plus your expenses to and from the studio . " " My wife will think I 'm nuts . " " Your wife will love you . When did she ever think she 'd be married to a guy who conversed with the next President of the United States 7 " " I 'll let you know in the morning , " Frank Kornsey said . Back in the motel room , the talk drifted to some of the curious associations into which Nixon seemed to fall . People he sought to align himself with , whose endorsement he was so pleased to accept , when even in political terms they probably did him more harm than good . " That Wilkinson , for Christ 's sake , he 's like a marionette with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director had come over from the studio in midafternoon , after working on final placement of the cameras . " Oh , Wilkinson 's a sweet guy , " Ailes said , " but he 's got absolutely no sense of humor . " " If you 're going to keep using him as a moderator , you should tell him to stop applauding all the answers . " " He 's been told , " Ailes said , " he 's been told . He just ca n't help it . " Ailes got up from the table . " Les face it , a lot of people think Nixon is dull . Think he 's a bore , a pain in the ass . They look at him as the kind of kid who always carried a book bag . Who was forty-two years old the day he was born . They figure other kids got footballs for Christmas , Nixon got briefcases and he loved it . He 'd always have his homework done and he 'd never let you copy . Now you put him on television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a funny-looking guy . He looks like somebody hung him in a closet overnight and he jumps out in the morning with his suit all bunched up and starts running around saying , 7 want to be President . ' I mean this is how he strikes some people . That 's why these shows are important . To make them forget all that . " Bichard Nixon came to Philadelphia the next day : Friday . There was the standard downtown motorcade at noon . Frank Rornsey took the whole day off to stay home and write questions . " I got some beauties , " he told Roger Ailes on the phone . Ailes went to the studio at two o'clock in the ' afternoon . " I 'm going to fire this director , " he said . " I 'm going to fire the son of a bitch right after the show . Look at this . Look at the positioning of these cameras . I 've told him fifty times I want closeups . Closeups ! This is a closeup medium . Its dull to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's what people are . That 's what television is . " He walked through the studio , shaking his head . " We wo n't get a shot better than waist-high from these cameras all night . That 's 1948 direction . When you had four people in every shot and figured you were lucky you had any shot at all . " . The audience filled the studio at seven o'clock . The panel was brought in at 7 : 15 . Frank Rom-sey was nervous . Roger Ailes offered him a shot of bourbon . " No thanks , " he said . " I 'll be all right . " He tried to grin . At 7 : 22 Jack Rourke stepped He was a heavy Irishman with gray hair . " Hello , " he said to the Frank Sinatra . " The Nixon family , David Eisenhower , and the Governor of Pennsylvania came in . The audience applauded . This audience , like the others , had been carefully recruited by the local Republican organization . " That 's the glee club , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The director walked into the control booth at 7 : 24 . " He 's crazy , " the director said , meaning Roger Ailes . " He has no conception of the mechanicallimitations involved in a show like this . He says he wants closeups , its like saying he wants to go to the moon . " The director took his seat at the control panel and spoke to a cameraman on the floor . " Make sure you know where Mrs. Nixon is and what she looks like . " A member of the Nixon staff ran into the booth . " Cut the sound in that studio next door . We 've got the press in there and we do n't want them to hear the warm-up . " " Now when Mr. Nixon comes in , " Jack Rourke was saying , " I want you to tear the place apart . Sound like ten thousand people . I 'm sure , of course , that you 'll also want to stand up at that point . So what do you say we try it now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear it . " " One forty-five to air , " the director said in the control booth . " Tell Rourke to check the sound level on the panel . " Jack Rourke turned to Frank Kornsey : " Ask a question , please . We 'd like to check your microphone . " Frank Rornsey leaned forward and spoke , barely above a whisper . His list of " beauties " lay on a desk before him . He was still pale , even through his makeup . " I was just wondering how Mr. and Mrs. Nixon are enjoying our wonderful city of Phila- . delphia , " he said . Pat Nixon , in a first row seat , gave her tight , closemouthed smile . " No , they do n't care for it , " Jack Rourke said . " Thirty seconds , " came a voice from the control room . " Clear the decks , please , thirty seconds . " Then , at exactly 7 : 30 , while a tape of Richard Nixon 's motorcade was being played for the viewers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cue the applause , move back camera one , move back one , " and Richard Nixon stepped through a crack in a curtain , hunched his shoulders , raised his arms , wiggled his wrists , made V-signs with his fingers and switched on his grin . Tack McKinney , the talk-show host , was wearing his hairpiece for the occasion . Nixon turned to him first , still with the grin , hands clasped before him , into his fourth show now and over the jitters . Maybe , in fact , ready to show off just a bit . A few new combinations , if the proper moment came , to please the crowd . " Yes , Mr. McKinney , " he said . Jack McKinney did not lead with his right but he threw a much stiffer jab than Nixon had been expecting ' : " Why are you so reluctant to comment on Vietnam this year when in 1952 , faced with a similar issue in Korea , you were so free with your partisan remarks 1 " Not a crippling question but there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been put to him in professional form . Nixon stepped back , a bit off balance . This sort of thing threatened the stability of the whole format ; the basis being the hypothesis that Nixon could appear to risk all by going live while in fact risking nothing by facing the loose syntax and predictable , sloppy thrusts of amateurs . He threw up an evasive flurry . But the grin was gone from his face . Not only did he know now that he would have to be careful of McKinney , he was forced to wonder , for the first time , what he might encounter from the others . The Negro was next . Warily : " Yes , Mr. Burress . " And Burress laid Black Capitalism right down the middle , straight and soft . Nixon had it memorized . He took a long time on the answer , though , savoring its cliches , making sure his wind had come back all the way . Then Frank Komsey , who studied his list and asked , " What are you going to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one to perfection . He had taken 1 : 22 with it in California , according to Roger Ailes 's chart , but had brought it down to 1:05 in Ohio . Now he delivered it in less than a minute . He was smooth again , and grinning , as he turned to the liberal housewife , Mrs. Mather . Was civil disobedience ever justified , she wondered . Nixon took a quick step backwards on the riser . His face fell into the solemnity mask . There were philosophic implications there he did not like . He could understand the impatience of , those less fortunate than ourselves , he assured her , and their demand for immediate improvement was , indeed , healthy for our society in many ? . ways . But-as long as change could be brought about within the system-and no , he was not like some who claimed it could not-then there was no cause , repeat , no cause that justified the breaking of a law . But he knew he would have to watch her , too . The first line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young Republican from Wharton wanted to know how to bring the McCarthy supporters back into the mainstream , which was fine , but then the newsman from Camden asked if Nixon agreed with Spiro Agnew 's charge that Hubert Humphrey was " soft un Communism . " He knew how to handle that one , but while sidestepping , he noted that this fellow , too , seemed unawed . That made three out of seven who were ready , it appeared , to mix it up . And one of them a good-looking articulate woman . And another , McKinney , who seemed truly mean . It was McKinney 's turn again : Why was Nixon refusing to appear un any of the news confrontation shows such as Meet the Press ? Why would he face the public only in stag-ed settings such as this , where the questions were almost certain to be worded generally enough to allow him any vague sort of answer he wanted to give ? Where the presence of the cheering studio audience was sure to intimidate any questioner who contemplated true engagement ? Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he eliminated any possibility of follow-up , any chance for true discussion ... ? The guy 's making a speech ! " Frank Shakespeare shouted in the control booth . Roger Ailes jumped for the phone to Wilkinson on stage . But McKinney was finished , for the moment . The question was , had he finished Nixon , too ? " I 've done those quiz shows , Mr. McKinney . I 've done them until they were running out of my ears . " There was no question on one point : Richard Nixon was upset . Staring hard at McKinney he grumbled something about why there ought to be more fuss about Hubert Humphrey not having press conferences and less about him and Meet the Press . It did not seem much of a recovery but in the control room Frank Shakespeare punched the palm of one hand with the fist of the other and said , That socks it to him , Dickie Baby ! " The audience cheered . Suddenly , Nixon , perhaps sensing a weakness in McKinney where he had feared that none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buoyed by the cheers , decided to slug it out . " Go ahead , " he said , gesturing . " I want you to follow up . " McKinney came back creditably , using the word " amorphous " and complaining that view-ers were being asked to support Nixon for Presi-dent on the basis of " nothing but a wink and a smile " particularly in regard to Vietnam . " Now , Mr. McKinney , maybe I have n't been as specific ... " and Nixon was off on a thorough rephrasing of his Vietnam non-position , which , while it contained no substance-hence , could not accommodate anything new-sounded , to un-initiates , like a public step forward . The audience was ecstatic . Outnumbered , two hundred forty-one to one , McKinn'ey could do nothing but smile and shake his head . " Be very careful with McKinney , " Shakespeare said , bending over Roger Ailes . " I want to give him a chance but I do n't want him to hog the show . " " Yeah , if he starts making another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer listening . He was grappling with a cameraman who had come into the control booth and began to take pictures of the production staff at work . " No press , " Shakespeare said , and when the man continued shooting his film , Shakespeare began to push . The cameraman pushed back as well as he could , but Shakespeare , leaning hard , edged him toward the door . Meanwhile , Frank Komsey , consulting his written list again , had asked , " What do you intend to do about the gun-control law ? " Then , quickly , the others : Are you writing off the black vote ? What about federal tax credits ... water and air pollution ? And then the Camden newsman , whose name was Flynn , asking about Nixon 's action in 1965 when he had called for the removal of a Rutgers history professor who had spoken kindly of the Vietcong-on campus . Nixon assured Mr. Flynn that academic freedom remained high on his personal list of privileges which all Americans should enjoy , but added , " There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , I do not believe that anyone who is paid by the government and who is using government facilities-and Rutgers , as I 'm sure you are aware , Mr. Flynn , is a state institutionhas the right to call for the victory of the enemy over American boys-s-while he is on the campus . " But now McKinney gathered himself for a final try : " You said that the Rutgers professor ' called for the Victory of the Vietcong , but as I recall he did n't say that at all . This is what I mean about your being able , on this kind of show , to slide off the questions . Now the facts were- " " Oh , I know the facts , Mr. McKinney . I know the facts . " Nixon was grinning . The audience poured forth its loudest applause of the night . Bud Wilkinson joined in , full of righteous fervor . Of course Mr. Nixon knew the facts . McKinney was beaten but would not quit : " The facts were that the professor did not ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , Mr. McKinney , and I believe I am quoting him exactly , was that he would Welcome the impending victory of the Vietcong . ' " " Which is not the same thing . " " Well , Mr. McKinney , you can make that distinction if you wish , but what I 'll do is I 'll turn it over to the television audience right now and let them decide for themselves about the seman tics . About the difference betwen ' calling for ' and ' welcoming ' a victory of the Vietcong . " He was angry but he had it under control and he talked fast and hard and when he was finished he swung immediately to the next questioner . The show was almost over . McKinney was through for the night . " Boy , is he going to be pissed , " Roger Ailes said as he hurried down from the control room . " He 'll think we really tried to screw him . But critically it was the best show he 's done . " Roger Ailes went looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wife . She was wearing a green dress and she did not smile . One thought of the remark a member of the Nixon staff had made : " Next to her , RN looks like Mary Poppins . " " Hello , Mrs. Nixon , " Roger Ailes said . She nodded . She had known him for months . " How did you like the show ? " She nodded very slowly , her mouth was drawn in a thin , straight line . " Everyone seems to think it was by far the best , " Ailes said . " Especially the way he took care of that McKinney . " Pat Nixon stared at the elevator door . The car stopped . She got off . and moved down a hallway with the Secret Service men around her . After the long-awaited Meet the Press show in Southern California , Ailes drove an hour and a half to an airfield , where a friend had arranged for him to make his first parachute jump . He missed the landing zone on his first try and decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the landing zone but ripped ligaments in his ankle . He had to take pills for pain that evening . The NBC studio in Burbank , location of the grand finale telethon the next day , was very big . One hundred and twenty-five telephones had been installed for the operators who would take calls during the show . The operators had been recruited by the local Republican organization . There also were seats for several hundred spectators , to be recruited by the organization , too . Richard Nixon had grown accustomed to hearing his answers applauded . It seemed foolish to deprive him on the final night of the campaign . Roger Ailes hobbled to the front row of the audience section . Immy Fiorentino , the lighting man , who had been used for the later panel shows and the Madison Square Garden rally , was there . " It 's going to be a dull two hours , " Roger Ailes said . " That 's for openers . " Immy Fiorentino shrugged . Dull , sparkling , he did not much care . As long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work ? " he asked . " Well , what 's going to happen , " Roger Ailes said , " is all of the questions are going to come through the operators over there and then runners will bring them down to the producer 's table , which will be set up here , and from there they 'll go to a screening room where the Nixon staff will tear them up and write their own . Then they 'll go to Bud Wilkinson who will cleverly read them and Nixon will read the answers off a card . " Later , Jack Rourke was asked how it really would work . " I understand Paul Keyes has been sitting up for two days writing questions , " Roger Ailes said . Keyes was a friend of Nixon 's who supervised the writing of the Laugh-In show . " Well , not quite , " Jack Rourke said . He seemed a little embarrassed . " What is going to happen ? " " Oh ... " It 's sort of semi-forgery , is n't it ? " Ailes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to answer . He 's written them in advance to make sure they 're properly worded . When someone calls with something similar , they 'll use Keyes ' question and attribute it to the person who called . Is n't that it ? " " More or less , " Jack Rourke said . At first , they were going to have Richard Nixon sit on the edge of a desk . The first desk that the NBC set designer had provided was on wheels . " Jesus Christ , he 'll lean against that and go sliding off the set , " Roger Ailes said . " It will be the highlight of the campaign . " Then Frank Shakespeare called . Since there were going to be two separate telethons ( one for the East , one for the West ) , lasting two hours each , it was felt that the edge of the desk would tend to be uncomfortable . Nixon preferred a " comfortable black swivel chair . " Roger Ailes told the set designer to produce one . Then Ailes hobbled through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some sense that would enable him to infuse the program , somehow , with imagination . To give originality and elan to what seemed doomed to tedium . " If we put Tricia and Julie over there , answering phones , we have to be careful who we put around them . " He turned to an assistant . " Dolores , make a note of that . Make sure we get good-looking girls around Julie and Tricia . " He talked to the cameramen : " Sixty , sixty-five , seventy per cent of the show will be RN on camera talking . You 've got to watch him-I like to shoot him close but two hours on stage and he 's going to perspire . So get away from him every once in a while and let him mop . " " Do you want Kleenex on stage ? " a floor man asked . " No , he 'll have a handkerchief in his inside breast pocket . " In the control room , most attention centered around the splicing of a Jackie Gleason endorsement which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the tape in Miami and it had been used first at the start of the Madison Square Garden rally : " My name is Jackie Gleason and I love this coumiru , I " ve neuer made a public choice like this before-s-but I think this country needs Dick Nixon and we need him now . " Roger Ailes had his right ankle in a bucket of ice . " Jesus Christ , this hurts , " he said . " Dolores , give me another of those pills , will you ? I wish there were some way to pipe the Humphreything in here tonight . It will be a hell of a lot more interesting . " He was in bad pain . And tired . And facing four hours of live direction in the evening . And-as the only member of Richard Nixon 's staff who would have thought to jump from an airplane the day before the biggest TV production of the campaign-feeling quite alone . He sat with his foot in an ice bucket in the control room through the afternoon , wishing he were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacation later in the week . Frank Shakespeare and Paul Keyes got to the studio at three o'clock . Shakespeare was in his standard dark suit , Keyes in a sky-blue turtleneck . Ailes struggled out to meet them . " Watch , " he said . " Now they 'll rip the whole thing up and start again . " The first change Shakespeare made was moving Julie and Tricia up from the second row to the first . Ailes had wanted them in the second row to make them seem simply part of the crowd , but Shakespeare said Nixon wanted to greet them as he entered and it would be awkward to have him leaning over other girls . " And he 'll walk over , " Shakespeare was saying , " and when he greets them I think he should kiss them . " " Well , I think kissing is a bit much , " Paul Keyes said . " But if he comes over , he 's got to kiss them . " " No , it looks stagy , " Keyes said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Have him kiss one of the other broads , " Ailes said . Paul Keyes continued to check the set . " Roger , can you put that camera one in closer so RN will be physically conscious of it ? " Ailes explained why moving the camera would be a problem . " I know that , " Keyes said , " But this was the one specific thing he asked for this morning . That we give him a camera close enough so he would be physically conscious of it . He wants this to be a very intimate show between him and the American people . And the only way he can do it is if that camera is right on top of him . " Ailes explained more of the technical prob-lems , " But RN wants to converse tonight . Low-key , easy , informal . He does n't want to make a speech . And he needs the camera there to push him into the low key . " Ailes rearranged the cameras . " Okay , " Paul Keyes said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yeah , but if I bring two in- " " He needs it close , Roger . " " Okay . You position two where you want it and I 'll restage ... Wait a minute , is four any good or is that too far away ? " " Four is perfect , " Keyes said . " The important thing is the relationship between him and the camera . He needs that nearness . " " Okay , " Ailes said , and he told the floor manager to mark with tape how far forward and to the left camera four should go without moving into the range of any of the other cameras . " Just tell RN he 'll have that one camera he can play to and well screw around with the others , " he said , and the problem was solved . Paul Keyes sat in the chair that had been brought out for Richard Nixon . " It 's too loose . Its got to have a solid back to it . " " Okay , I 'll take care of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the control room and called the set designer and told him they needed another chair . The designer protested . " Do you want him to tip over ? " Ailes said . " The back is loose . Do you want him to lean back and go over on his ass ? " The designer suggested using an orange chair he had brought out earlier . " Goddam it , no , were not going to use an orange chair . We 've been through that ... I said were not going to use an orange chair . Forget it . I 'll get the goddam chair . " He put down the phone and turned to Dolores Hardie , the assistant . " Get the designer to get a god dam chair . I told that creepy bastard as soon as he brought it out that we were n't going to use an orange chair . " It was four o'clock in the afternoon . Frank Shakespeare was worried about the studio getting too hot . " Make sure you 've got that handkerchief soaked in witch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't do that sincerity bit with the camera if he 's sweating . " Shakespeare got more worried about the temperature . " He 's going to be out there four hours tonight . " It was decided to cancel the five o'clock rehearsal of the opening so the lights could be shut off , the studio sealed , and cold air piped in . Roger Ailes went across the hall to a dressing room and lay down on a couch . " This is the beginning of a whole new concept , " Ailes said . " This is it . This is the way they 'll be elected forevermore . The next guys up will have to be performers . The interesting question is , how sincere is a TV set ? If you take a cold guy and stage him warm , can you get away with it ? I do n't know . But I felt a lot better about jumping out of that plane yesterday than I do about this thing tonight . " The announcer who was to do the opening called to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do n't want it like a quiz show , " Roger Ailes said . " He 's going to be Presidential tonight so announce Presidentially . " The studio was opened and the hundred and twenty-five girls who had volunteered to answer the phones were led in . Frank Shakespeare watched them take their places and an expression of horror came over his face . " Oh my God ! " he said . " This is terrible ! Where are the black faces ? Where are the black faces ? " He turned and went running off to find the woman who was in charge of the volunteers . She was a heavy woman with gray hair . " We 're going live across the country on Elec- tion Eve in an hour and a half and there 's not one black face up there . We ca n't do that . It looks terrible . " " I know , " the woman said . " I know . vVe tried . In fact we had twenty who agreed to come . But none of them showed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The woman gave a shrug that said , " What do you expect me to do ? After all , you know they 're undependable . " There was one Negro girl , sitting near the end of the next to last row . Someone pointed her out to Shakespeare . " Oh , yeah , " he said . Staring . " I could ask her to come down front so you 'd be sure to get her in the picture . " Shakespeare never faltered . " Would you ? Gee , that would be terrific . Terrific . " The Hubert Humphrey telethon , which started half an hour before Nixon 's , was being shown in the press room . Humphrey was on with Paul Newman , Ruddy Hackett , Danny Thomas , and others . He was obsequious to them all . Cue cards , other cameras , and a morass of wires and unused folding chairs were visible all over the stage . The Humphrey producers , apparently , had left their shirttails out on purpose , to point up the contrast with what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More startling , Humphrey was answering questions live . Actually talking to the people who called him on the phone . There was no Paul Keyes , no Bud Wilkinson to protect him . " That 's crazy , " Al Scott said , appalled at what he saw . " They 've got no control . " Richard Nixon was in a good mood . He sat in his comfortable black swivel chair with the back that had been tightened , his legs crossed , his smile seeming less forced than usual , his voice and rhetoric pleasantly subdued . If camera four had been any closer it would have put out his eye . He leaned into it as Bud Wilkinson read each question and responded in his most conversational tone . The substance was no different from what it had been all along , but the style was at its peak . The Social Security question was repeated at the beginning of each hour-on both shows-so that anyone who had just tuned in would be sure to hear that Richard Nixon did not intend to have senior citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added a few twists to break the monotony of the answers . At one point , Bud Wilkinson walked across the room to where Julie and Tricia were answering phones and asked them what seemed to be on most callers ' minds . Then David Eisenhower read a letter from his grandfather . Earnestly . Then there was the chat with Mrs. Nixon . She answered a couple of Wilkinson/ Pau I Keyes questions of less than monumental importance , and then , as the audience-on cue-applauded , she grinned and ... began to applaud herself . It was simply a reflex . There had been so much applause in her life . And all through this campaign . She had sat , half-listening , then with hermind drifting more and more as the weeks and speeches passed so slowly into one another . Bringing her finally to this television studio on this final night where all that was left of her was reflex : you hear applause-applaud . Then , in a cruel instant , she realized what she had done and that no doubt her error had been communicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned to dread . Here , on . the last night , with everything fitting neatly into place as it had from the start , she had spoiled it . She jerked up her hands to cover her face . Roger Ailes switched quickly to another shot . Other than that , the two hours went smoothly , though after the immense effort of preparation it was inconceivable that they could have gone any other way . All along , whatever else the campaign was not , it was smooth . Between shows , Richard Nixon disappeared into a dressing room for a ham and cheese sandwich , a cup of coffee , a shower , a rubdown , and a clean shirt . David Eisenhower , looking tall and bewildered , wandered down from his seat . He " was carrying two colored photographs of Richard Nixon . He approached Jack Rourke . " Do you suppose I could get these autographed ? " he said . " You know him as well as I do , " Jack said . " Yeah , " David Eisenhower said . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nixon 's personal aide . He repeated his request . " Now ? " Chapin asked , straining to believe what he was hearing . " You want those autographed now ? " David Eisenhower managed a tentative nod . " Oh , no , " Dwight Chapin said . " Not now . " Richard Nixon tired a bit during the second show and started talking about those hundreds of confessed murderers who had been set free by the Supreme Court , but it was not noticeable enough to prevent Frank Shakespeare from patting people on the shoulder in the control booth and saying , " He 's strong . He 's strong . " Toward the end , Bud Wilkinson began a question by saying , " This one is from a carpenter named Bob Will in Orlando , Florida ... " And Richard Nixon started his answer with , " Well , you see , Mr. Carpenter ... " But the campaign was over . " I 'm not a showman , " Richard Nixon was telling America . " I 'm not a television personality . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go for applause . Just thoughtful . And he did it ! " Roger Ailes was helped down the stairway and out to the car . " Tonight , " he said , " this was the Nixon I met on the Douglas show . This was the Nixon I wanted to work for . "
