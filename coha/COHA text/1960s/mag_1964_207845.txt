Within an hour , 74,000 Chrysler auto workers were scheduled to walk off the job at 47 plants across the U.S. , bringing production to a standstill just as the 1965 models were beginning to roll off assembly lines . <P> Suddenly , the strike was off . After 23 straight hours of haggling in Chrysler 's Detroit headquarters , United Auto Workers President Walter Reuther got on the phone to the White House , let Lyndon Johnson know that he had just reached a milestone settlement . The President was delighted , but he wanted to know whether the agreement conformed to the anti-inflationary standards set by his Council of Economic Advisers . " Are the guidelines intact ? " asked Lyndon . " Well , " replied Reuther , " they 're bent a little . " <P> Historic Agreement . That was quite an understatement . The current guidelines urge labor to limit wage increases to 3.2% , but the U.A.W.-Chrysler settlement provides nearly 5% in added benefits . The three-year package may cost Chrysler an extra $30 million a year , and if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and G.M. ( with 345,000 ) are anything like Chrysler 's , their costs will be far greater . <P> The settlement ended ten weeks of hard bargaining , gave Reuther just about everything he asked for . In dollars and cents terms , it was the best auto contract ever . The previous record was set in 1955 , when workers got a 45 hourly increase in wages and benefits , excluding automatic cost of living increases . The new contract gives them roughly 57 an hour more , not counting the cost of living raises . <P> Jubilant , Reuther hailed it as " the most historic agreement in the history of the American labor movement . " <P> More important than the wage increases were benefits in areas that most concern workers these days . By establishing one of the largest pension programs in U.S. industry , the contract permits production workers to retire with a decent in come at 55 or 60 , opens up jobs for younger workers and eases the impact of automation ( see U.S. BUSINESS ) . <P> Good Friday &; Birthdays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers who retire at 65 from $2.80 per month for each year of service to $4.25 . It provides substantial supplemental benefits that will give pensions averaging $381 per month to workers who retire at 60 after 30 years ' service , $200 or so to those who retire at 55 . It gives every worker an additional week of vacation time , adds two extra paid holidays ( Good Friday and the worker 's own birthday ) to the old total of seven , commits Chrysler to footing the whole bill ( instead of half of it ) for a worker 's life and accident insurance . Finally , it gives assembly-line workers an extra twelve minutes a day of relief time- " John time " in the industry-in addition to the 24 minutes they had been getting . <P> Relief time may sound like a trivial matter , but workers cherish it as a break from their machines and time for a smoke or a cup of coffee . It was the issue that nearly stymied the negotiations and brought on a strike . To industry officials , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but Reuther argued that workers needed a longer break from the numbing monotony of the assembly line , refused to budge until they got it .
