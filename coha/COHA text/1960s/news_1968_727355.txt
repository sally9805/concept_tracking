txt President Johnson delivered a strong defense of his Vietnam policy in a speech to the American Legion convention in New Orleans this afternoon , and then told a B'nai B'rith audience here this evening that he had warned the Soviet Union against the threat or use of force in Berlin . Shouting frequently and pounding his fist on the lec:tern , Mr. Johnson vowed in arr ' emotional address to the 50th Annual convention of the veterans ' organization that he would not , stop bombing North Vietnam until Hanoi offered reciprocal military restraint . He stressed the importance to a peace settlement of restoring the inviolability of ? the demilitarized zone separating North Vietnam from South Vietnam and seemed to be telling Hanoi that this issue could be a fruitful area ? of bargaining to break .. the stalemate at the Paris talks . Mr. Johnson traced the antecedents for his policy in Vietnanx back through Presidents Kennedy , Eisenhower and Truman , World War II and the great depression to the American intervention on the Allies ' side in World War I. A Sweeping Defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , invoked the dead of past wars to preserve American security and asked " how many millions of young Americans would be lost in the larger war that would surely and inevitably come " if the , line had not been drawn in Vietnam . In the more subdued speech to a dinner meeting of the 125th convention of the B'nai B'rith at the Shoreham Hotel here this evening , the President said the Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia had created " new military and political risks . . . which demand even closer cooperation among the Western allies . " " For our part , " he members to approximately 3,000 members of the Jewish service organization , their wives and , guests , " we have made it unmistakably clear that the use of force and the threat of force will not be ' tolerated in areas of our common responsibility , like Berlin . " At a time when Vice President Humphrey appeared to be trying to soften the psychological impact df the war in the election campaign , Mr. Johnson // took a decidedly hard line in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the violence subsides , " the President said . " We yearn for the day when our men can come home . " But , he added , ' ' no man can predict when that day will come . " Vice President Humphrey , speaking to students in Philadelphia yesterday , said the United States might be able to bring some of its troops home from Vietnam early in 1969 , or perhaps even late this year . Some Americans , the President said , " concluded that changes of such magnitude were taking place in the Communist world that we could relax our vigilance , trusting that the Communists wanted the same kind of world that we Americans wanted . " " The message out of Czechooslovakia is plain , " he said . " The independence of nations , the liberty of men are today still under challenge . The free parts of the world will survive only , only if they are capable of maintaining their strength and capable of maintaining and building their unity . " Effect on Casualties If he were to stop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President asserted , " our casualties would skyrocket . " He said he had asked Gen. Creighton W. Abrams , the American commander in Vietnam , what the effect of a bombing halt would be if'there were no reciprocal restraint . He said he had been told that such an order would allow the enemy " to increase his strength severalfold in 10 days . " General Abrams , the President continued , also replied that he would be forced to withdraw American and South Vietnamese forces from the region south of the demilitarized zone ' that straddles the border because they would be unable to withstand the pressure the enemy could then exert . " Now I 'm not going to issue any order like that , " the President shouted , hammering his fists on the lectern as 6,000 veterans and their wives in the audience responded with cheers . He asserted strongly that it was better to destroy enemy ammunition in North . Vietnam by bombing than to wait until " it 's stopped by some American soldier in his body . " The President noted that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , continued bombing ? an invasion of the North Vietnamese panhandle ? and he emphatically rejected withdrawal of American and South Vietnamese forces . from the region just below the DMZ as " surrender on the installment plan . " Warms to Audience As his 43-minute speech unfolded , the President seemed to warm to the atmosphere in the spacious Municipal Auditorium and to his audience of veterans . They , men of his generation , seemed to respond to him . Among the myriad campaign ribbons , decorations and unit badges on legion uniforms were buttons reading " Register Communists , Not Guns . " In his remarks to the B'nai B'rith convention , the President reiterated the six-point proposal for a peaceful settlement of Arab-Israeli differences lie had made a week after the third Arab-Israeli ended ' in June 1967 .

Jarring of Sweden , the United Nations envoy , to work toward a negotiated peace and called for the retirement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Israel is the only country with troops on territory outside her former boundaries , which have , , never been recognized by the Arab states . In his first point , Mr , Johnson said it was " crucial that each nation 's right t ? live be , recognized . " He urgea ? Istael , and the Arab states to begin ' immediate negotiations , no matter " how the talking is done at the outset . " Israel has insisted on direct negotiations , a condition the Arab states have refused . The President 's other points were that Middle Eastern states respect each other 's political and territorial rights ; that all parties " , stretch ' their imaginetions  --  sci-that their interest and the world 's interest in Jerusalem can be fully taken into account in any final settlement " ; that the plight of the Arab refugees be recognized and solved " ; that Israel 's right to use the Suez Canal and the Strait of Tiran be recognized by the Arabs , and that the major outside powers , the Soviet Union and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' on .
