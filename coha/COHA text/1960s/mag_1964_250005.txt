The final weeks of a presidential campaign can usually be counted on to generate a crescendo of press partisanship . <P> But there has been little that can be called usual about the 1964 campaign . <P> And as it drew to a close last week , the press coverage , while as comprehensive as ever , reflected a curious and almost deliberate note of political detachment . <P> It was as if the newspapers , in an effort to be scrupulously impartial , had measured their attention to the candidates with a ruler . <P> Reporters and columnists alike might well have been making amends for earlier sins of excess , for the extra emotion that once showed so strongly in story after anti-Goldwater story . Or perhaps the press was just plain bored by a dull campaign , had lost interest in interpreting it . Newsmen traveling with both Johnson and Goldwater may have decided that there was no longer any doubt at all about who was going to be the winner , that further displays of partisanship on their part were unnecessary and redundant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the editorial pages stopped taking sides . But even there , the pattern was not familiar . <P> Editor &; Publisher , announcing final results of its Who 's for Whom poll , reported 440 papers , with 27 million circulation for Johnson , against 359 papers , with 9,000,000 circulation for Goldwater . Johnson 's percentage of 42.4% came nowhere near the 67% registered by Eisenhower in the magazine 's 1952 poll , but it was a long way from the mere 14% support that went that year to Democrat Adlai Stevenson - who understandably raised the charge of a " one-party press . " This year 's tabulation demolished Stevenson 's accusation with statistical authority . <P> <P> About the only pattern that endured was stitched by those papers that took no sides at all . About half of the nation 's newspapers refused to choose . One last-minute entry in this neutral rank was the New York Daily News-which up to last week had been neutral for Goldwater . The largest daily in the country is not known for its reticence ; it gives its readers advice on everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end the only recommendation that the News had for its readers was to vote . <P> " The Goldwater campaign has been so clumsily conducted that one wonders how capable a President he would be . <P> On the other hand , we wonder whether the country could stand four more years of Johnson . " With that , and " with great regret , " the News boldly came out for neither man .
