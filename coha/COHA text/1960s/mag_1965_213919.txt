While mills ran near to capacity last week , steel was being poured at its highest level in five years : 2,700,000 tons . Yet the record was clouded by the continued stockpiling of steel by customers who fear a strike in May , when the industry 's contract with the United Steelworkers expires . <P> Users are now stockpiling at the rate of 1,000,000 tons a month , a rate that would give them 9,000,000 tons on hand at the strike deadline . Though that is well below the 12 million tons on hand when the 1959 strike broke out , it is enough to curtail steel demand for several months if the strike is short or never comes off . <P> The uncertainty has been heightened this year by the United Steelworkers ' presidential-election struggle being waged by President David J. McDonald and Challenger I. W. Abel , the union 's secretary-treasurer . All contract negotiations have been suspended during the fight and , as the Feb. 9 union election approaches , a bitter campaign is being fought . It is replete with denunciation and sarcasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound trucks at mill gates and union halls . Abel portrays McDonald as a has-been who prefers nightclubs and Palm Springs to the open hearth and McKeesport , calls for the rejection of " tuxedo unionism , " and charges that the Steelworkers have suffered from McDonald 's " happy-go-lucky , old-buddy , old-pal negotiations " with industry . McDonald , warming to the fight and seeming to pick up strength as he does , belittles Abel 's qualifications , calls him " a pretty good bookkeeper , " and says that before Abel can run a union , " he 'll have to go somewhere to learn to negotiate . " <P> To illustrate that he already knows how , McDonald last week opened contract talks with the major can companies with demands for substantial wage increases and greater job security . These negotiations , said McDonald , may set the pattern for the steel talks . But the fact remains that only after the 976,000 Steelworkers decide who will lead them - and where-can the U.S. begin to know with any certainty what course the 1965 economy will follow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
