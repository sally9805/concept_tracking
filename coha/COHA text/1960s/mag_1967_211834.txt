Man and society are born out of both : violence and gentle cooperation . " That is how Psychiatrist Bruno Bettelheim defines a paradoxical but inescapable fact touching the whole history of " the children of Cain . " How the two forces are balanced in an individual helps determine his behavior , even his sanity . How they are balanced in society helps determine its political organization , the degree and condition of its civilization . In the U.S. today , it seems to many that violence is in the ascendant over cooperation , disruption over order , and anger over reason . <P> The greatest single source of this fear lies in the Negro riots that keep tearing at American cities . What is alarming about them is not merely the frustration and bitterness they proclaim , not merely the physical and psychological damage they cause , but also the fact that a few Negro leaders are deliberately trying to justify the riots with a violent and vengeful ideology . This in turn can all too easily be seen as just one aspect of a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising , or seems to , especially in senseless killings and wanton attacks . Fear of the darkened city streets has become a fact of urban life . The memories of bizarre multiple murders linger in the mind-13 people dead in Austin from a sniper 's rifle , eight nurses in Chicago killed by a demented drifter . The recollection of the Kennedy assassination remains part of the scene . A burgeoning , largely uncontrolled traffic in guns has put firearms into some 50 million American homes , many of their owners insisting that the weapons are needed for self-defense . In the movies and on television , murder and torture seem to be turning Americans into parlor sadists . A recent trend on the stage is the " theater of cruelty , " and a growing number of books delve into the pornography of violence . <P> The rest of the world is ready to adjudge America as an excessively violent country in which brutal , irrational force can erupt any minute on a massive scale . This view is reinforced by the sheer driving energy of the U.S. It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gangster saga-which audiences all over the world worship as epic entertainment and as a safe refuge for dreams of lawless freedom . In a very different way , the view of America the Violent is also reinforced by the Vietnamese war , in which critics both at home and abroad profess to see a growing strain of American brutality . <P> Comparative Mayhem <P> Violence is so universal and elusive that sociology and psychology can only approximate a complex truth . Comparisons with other countries are illuminating but hardly conclusive . The U.S. has certainly experienced nothing like the massacre of 400,000 Communists in Indonesia ; nor have Watts or Newark approached the lethal fury of an Indian or an Arab mob . But these are countries at vastly different levels of civilization . In the industrialized world , the U.S. undeniably ranks high in violence . The U.S. homicide rate stands at around five deaths for 100,000 people . This compares with .7 in England , 1.4 in Canada , 1.5 in France , 1.5 in Japan ( but 32 in Mexico ) . Within the U.S. , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgia and Alabama to 6.1 in New York and .5 in Vermont . Not that homicide or any other statistics can tell the complete story .
