txt WASHINGTON , June 18 ? j President Johnson announced ) today the first 12 recipients of funds under the controversial rent supplement program . One of the 12 is a consortium that is attempting to provide lowincome housing in East Harlem . Mr. Johnson made the announcement at a news conference . Opening statement , Page 56 . The rent supplement program is designed to provide housing for the very poor , and the list , chosen after much deliberation , sought to dramatize that intent . All the projects that will benefit from the funds are in neighborhoods of manifest need , some in areas of dramatic ra , - // dal tension and national concern . On the list are three of the country 's poorest Negro neighborhoods the Watts area of Los Angeles , the Hough district of Cleveland and the Roxbury ghetto in Boston . Watts was the scene of riots last summer and the Hough and- Roxbury districts , where unemployment is high and the housing poor , have been described as potentially explosive . Perhaps the most striking choice of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers were evicted from their homes several months ago . Nearly 100 of the farmhands , all Negro , came to Washington in early April and- camped in tents across from the White House to protest housing conditions in the Missisippi Delta region . Robert C. Weaver , Secretary of Housing and Urban Development , dispatched two aides shortly afterward to the area to see what might be done . Under the grant , the Catholic Diocese of Natchez-Jackson , the sponsor of the project , will build 120 housing units , for which most of the tenant farmers and their families are likely to be eligible . The New York grant , which amounts to $40,320 in rent supplement payments , will be used to help pay for the unusual rehabilitation project being carried outs by the United States Gypsum Company in the 300 block of East 102d Street . A total of 116 units i3 being rehabilitated , of which 60 will be made possible by the rents supplement program . Upon completion , the project will be sold to the Metro North East Harlem Housing Association , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Settlement House , the Maremont Foundation , St. Lucy 's Catholic Church and the Church of the Resurrection of the East Harlem Parish . The Metro House Association is generally engaged in the redevelopment of the area from 99th Street to 103d Street between Second Avenue and the East River . Other grants involved projects in Philadelphia , New Orleans , Providence , R. I. ; Omaha , Saginaw , Mich. ; Pasco , Wash. , and San Antonio , Tex . San Antonio is in the district of Representative Henry B. Gonzales , a Democrat who has been a stanch supporter of housing legislation for many years , and Saginaw is in the district of Representative James Harvey , a Republican who strongly backed the rent supplement program after earlier opposition , a gesture much apreciated by the Administration . How It Works Under the rent supplement program , the Federal Government will pay what amounts to a subsidy for poor families to live In deecnt housing . The payments will not be sent directly to the tenants but to the sponsor-owner of the project . The sponsors must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; cooperatives , or limited dividend corporations . This is a private corporation in which the net return on capital is limited , usually , depending on state law , to 6 per cent . The tenants in a rent supplement project , which can involve either new construction or rehabilitation , must pay 25 per cent of their income for rent . The difference between this amount and the " economic rent , " or what the sponsor needs to pay off his mortgage and pay other basic expenses , constitutes the rent supplement . To be eligible for a rent supplement project , a tenant 's income must be low enough to make him eligible for public housing . The national median income of public housing occupants on June 30 , 1965 , was $2,583 , but this figure naturally varies with the locality . In addition , eligibility is limited to individuals who are either physically handicapped , elderly ( 62 years old or over ) . displaced or expected to be displaced by governmental action such as urban renewal or highway construction , occupants of substandard housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural disaster . In addition to providing rent supplement payments , the Government , through the Department of Housing and Urban Development , also insures the mortgage that the sponsorowner must receive from a local bank to build the project . Today 's announcement involved only grant reservations for the rent supplement payments , a total of $663,470 for the 12 projects . The Federal Housing Administration must s ill process applications for loan insurance before construction can begin , a process that may take considerable time . However , none of the 12 projects should have any difficulty receiving this insurance , After long and acrimonious debate , Congress appropriated $12-million in April to operate the program for the remainder of the fiscal year 1966 , which ends June 30 . In early May , the House voted to provide the program with $22-million for the fiscal year 1967 , which begins July 1 . This appropriation must still clear the Senate . The Senate Appropriations Committee will vote on the matter early next week . Administration strategists are by no means certain of the outcome , and today 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy publicity before the vote . The Appropriations Committee is feared because earlier this year it denied the Administration funds to get the programs under way in the fiscal year 1966 . This action was later reversed on the Senate floor by a one-vote margin . 6 Tenements Rehabilitated Six tenement houses on 102d Street have been or are being rehabilitated by the United States Gypsum Company at a cost of $1.25-million . The project has been described as an experiment through which the company hopes to create new financial and technical tools for the rehabilitation of old buildings . Four months ago , when 24 families moved into their new apartments in the remodeled tenement at 307-9 East 102d Street , it was said that United States Gypsum was out to prove that rehabilitation was financially rewarding for private companies . A spokesman for the company was quoted as having said that a private investor could realize an 8 per cent profit above his acquisition and construction costs when he sold a completed " rehab " to a nonprofit managerial agency . It was pointed out at the time that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran from $20 to $40'a month , with an average of $28 . After the remodeling process , they were raised to a range of $76 to $85 a month , with an average of $78.
