In one of several large scrapbooks of the life and times of John Held , Jr , the cartoonist who sometimes seems to have invented the 1920s for his own humorous purposes , there are newspaper clippings about a severe accident that befell him in March 1925 while riding at his Connecticut farm . Held 's horse bolted , threw him and kicked him ; his face was badly torn and he suffered a severe concussion . In the typewritten notes which accompanied the clippings there is this statement : " John claimed in 1941 that ' he had achieved no success until after a horse kicked him in the head , and that 's no lie . ' " Reporting many months after the accident on Held 's recovery , his neighborhood paper , the Westport Herald , said , " The doctors stated at the time of the accident that Held would most probably live , but would never again lead a normal life , and he never did !

They are a delightful miscellany of letters , drawings , clippings , and reviews , interspersed with Mrs. Held 's recollections of remarks made by her husband and stories told by him of his career before she knew him ( there were three previous Mrs. Helds ) . At no time , so far as I could tell from the scrapbooks , had Held 's life ever been what is generally thought of as " normal . " Held was not an eccentric , but he was most certainly an individualist . He is said to have been " tall and handsome " with an easy and engaging manner , and " a horn comedian . " A friend of mine who is the son of one of Held 's oldest friends used to see a great deal of him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " very witty , urbane , and friendly ; one of the last men to go on wearing a raccoon coat . " He was passionately fond of animals , odd species of which he collected at his farm in Westport and later in Belmar , New Jersey . where he moved after serving near there in the Signal Corps in World War II . He once was a candidate for Congress in Connecticut , managed to run ( or sit it out ) without making a single speech , and was to his evident relief but no surprise defeated by a small margin . He once rode in a rodeo in Oregon in 1922 and was wildly applauded more for his nerve than his skill and more for his fame as a cartoonist ( which by that time was national ) than either . His cowboy experience , however , started at a very early age . He was born in Salt Lake City in 1889 , and there is a note in rine of the scrapbooks which reads : " 1895 ? Played ' Indians ' and cowboys with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cowboys . " It was some years later in the teens of this century that Held turned his attention to the kinds of cowboys he helped to record for posterity , the " drugstore cowboys " and their big-city cousins , the " parlor snakes , " the " slickers , " and the " cake-eaters , " and Mr. Lynes has been contributing observations for " After Hours " since the column began in 1947 . He has also meanwhile written several books on arts and manners , from " Snobs " to " Confessions of a Dilettante. " the female counterparts of these ? the " flappers " and the " baby vamps . " Held sold his first cartoon to a national magazine , the old , pre-Luce Life , in 1908 when he was nineteen , though he had been doing sports and political cartoons , and " anything else " for the Salt Lake Tribune from the time he was sixteen . ( In the scrapbooks is the following entry : " J. used to claim that he never went beyond the fourth grade in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H.S. with Harold Ross. * They were both on the staff of the school paper . While in High School he started doing woodcuts . " ) Held arrived in New York with the first of his wives , Myrtle , in 1910 , and like all young men of the day who braved the great city to make their fortunes , he is reported to have had " four dollars in his pocket . " He got a job in a newspaper art department .. Mahonri Young . a distinguished sculptor about twelve years Held 's senior but like him a. native of Salt Lake City , arrived at about the same time . " John never went to art school , " Mrs. Held told me . " His only teacher was Mahonri Young , and he taught him drawing not sculpture . " It took Held quite a long time to develop the style for which he became famous ? the dashing black-and-white technique with which he turned out parlor snakes with patent-leather hair parted in the middle , their trousers tight to the knee and billowing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jutting from their jaws . His flappers , with their garters and " step-ins " fluffy below their short skirts , their cloche hats like inverted demitasses clamped on their " shingled " heads , waving fifteen-inch cigarette holders like magicians ' wands , became not just an ironic comment on " the younger generation " but a model of sophistication for them . By the time Held got kicked by a horse he had already put his indelible stamp on the looks and manners of an era . " In the winter of 1919 , " a typed note in one of the scrapbooks records , " Scott Fitzgerald went to work for the Barron Collier Agency where a light-verse writer was needed in the copy department at $90 a month . He *The founder and for many years the editor of The New Yorker. wrote slogans for streetcar cards . John drew the cards that Fitzgerald wrote . " Held 's debt to F. Scott Fitzgerald is difficult to assess , and I have not been able to discover whether they were good friends or not . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paradise , published in April 1920 and an immediate sensation , who spilled the beans about what his generation was up to , and the older generation , brought up in Victorian parlors under the eyes of chaperons , was appalled . In a chapter-within-a-chapter Fitzgerald exposed " that great current American phenomenon , the ' petting party ' " and explored the mores of the " Popular Daughter " who " becomes engaged every six months between the ages of sixteen and twenty-two . " It sounds rather more naughty than devastating now , but in those days the statement that " None of the Victorian mothers ... had any idea how casually their daughters were accustomed to be kissed " was greeted with shocked disbelief . The " belle " of the older generation had , he said , become the " flirt " and the " flirt " had become the " baby vamp . " These were the mores that Held took such delight in holding up to ridicule ? more humorously than ironically , as a man who obviously was no prig would find it incumbent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the age of bathtub gin , roadsters ( and rumble seats ) , coonskin coats , beaded evening dresses , fiat-chested prom-trotters , the Charleston , rolled stockings , and " boop-boop-adoop . " In some respects it looks open and innocent compared with our own day . Gangland funerals , Peaches and her " Daddy " Browning ( the scandal that made the New York Graphic the most sensational tabloid of the sensational twenties ) , speakeasies , flagpole sitters , undergraduates who swallowed live gold fish ? such matters seem tame compared with the sinister machinations of " The Syndicate , " the Profumo case , the mystic cult of LSD as practiced in Millbrook , New York , and undergraduates experimenting with pot . But these comparisons are superficial , and the similarities of the mores of the ' twenties to our own day are not enough to explain the revival of interest in what Frederick Lewis Allen called " The Decade of Bad Manners . " Held enormously enjoyed the mannerless manners of the ' twenties , though that is not to say that he approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not have endowed the young men and women he drew with such plausible life , nor could he have dissected their foibles in such a manner that he became a hero to those whom he most ridiculed . There is nothing bitter about his satire ; but there is nothing sentimental about it either . His scalpel scarcely ever cuts to the bone , and very frequently his comment is submerged under a watery gag , as it was in his famous cover for the old Life of a young woman doing the Charleston with a gay chap twice her age . The caption is " Teaching Old Dogs New Tricks . " To explain why Held should have become the visual spokesman of an era requires looking not just at his immediate quarry but at the landscape in which it had its habitat . " Teen-agers " had not yet been identified as a social class ( as distinct from merely an age-group ) in the 1920s . They were still referred to as schoolboys and schoolgirls , and they were not yet isolated as a fairly cohesive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become soon after World War II . " The Younger Generation , " however , which seemed to encompass the ages from about sixteen to thirty , most assuredly had been discovered , and as Mark Sullivan in his discussion of the ' twenties in Our Times says , " after the war an emphasis was placed on the young , simply because they were young , that had probably never been equaled in the history of the world . " Furthermore , he pointed out , this was " . . a period in which , in many respects , youth was the model , age the imitator . On the dance Boor , in the beauty parlor , cm the golf course ; in clothes , manners , and many points of view , elders strove earnestly to look and act like their children , in many eases their grandchildren . " The first world war helped to change the rapidity with which children were permitted to grow into young adulthood , and it seems that the urge to affect the sophisticated attitudes toward sex , amusements , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it had only a decade before . It was the gray area beAFTER HOURS tween their innocence and the sophistication they hoped to achieve that provided Held with some of the targets of his satire , though this is more evident in his short stories , which appeared frequently in Harper 's Bazaar , Scribner 's , and other magazines , than in his drawings . Indeed the drawings , though they have a youthful quality , make no appreciable distinctions between the looks of the seventeen-year-old and the college graduate . There is a kind of heartlessness to the pseudo-sophistication of the youngsters Held writes about , a. studied carelessness about the feelings of others ( it can not be called viciousness ) that is far less evident in his drawings . Callow is perhaps the best word for his youths and maidens ; it is a ' twenties word . The teaching of Freud was filtered through the journalistic processes of popularization in the ' twenties and , according to Frederick Lewis Allen , it was interpreted thus : " The first requirement of mental health was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy , you must obey your libido . " But it was probably the closed automobile that changed sexual activity more than Freudian doctrine ; it provided an unchaperunable , highly mobile , and secret hideaway for the exercise of the libido , a freedom heretofore unknown to young couples in love or on the prowl . Edna St. Vincent Millay 's famous quatrain about her candle which burned at both ends and gave a lovely light was a sort of Scout 's Oath for the sophisticated young who believed , or said they did , that " I have a right to do anything that does n't harm anyone else . " To the astonishment of their parents young women smoked ; they swore , they painted their faces , they drank with men , rolled their stockings and flaunted their garters , and they were reluctantly permitted to get away with it . Held , however , did not let them get away with it ; at least he did not let their posing go unnoticed or uncriticized . His attitude is perhaps best summed up in the caption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a raccoon coat , his hat pushed back on his head , a vacuous look on his bland face from which protrudes a pipe . It reads : " One mother , one father , one tonsil-expert , four general practitioners , three trained nurses , five governesses , During the ' twenties Held became ( for an artist ) a very rich man ; not only were his drawings sought after by all manner of magazine and book publishers , but he was doing two comic strip ' for newspapers , for which he was paid $2,500 a week in those almost income-tax-free days . The strips collapsed with the stock market , partly , I have been told , because Held stood out for a high price when publishers were feeling the pinch , and partly because the mood had changed ; the glitter of his collegiate heroine of the ' twenties , " Margie , " became tarnished by economic history , and flappers and parlor snakes did not fit the mood of the Depression . In the ' thirties Held turned to sculpture and to woodcuts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the art in which he most wanted to excel ) , and his small bronzes of animals , which combined great dexterity and understanding with an affectionate humor , commanded a good deal of respect from critics . ( One of them reviewing a show of Held 's bronzes in the New York gun in March 1939 said , " If John Held does n't watch out , he may turn out to be the Frederic Remington of this era . " ) He also turned his hand more and more to humorous woodcuts , many of which appeared in The New Yorker . They were for the most part comic evocations of the manners and styles of the Gay ' Nineties , and they appeared about a decade before the revival of the gaslight era became popular with nightclubs and decorators . When Held arrived in Cambridge , Massachusetts , in early 1940 to be Harvard 's first " artist in residence , " reporters from the college newspaper asked him what he was supposed to do and he replied that they knew as much about it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the first such artist at Harvard , but the University of Georgia was evidently impressed ; he spent two semesters in the same capacity there . it is not likely that the academic community chose him because he had in 1939 designed the sets for one of the zaniest musical abomi- *Merely Margie , en Awfully Sweet Girl and Rah , Rah , Rosalie , both syndicated by King Features.nations ever to see Broadway , poppin . During the ' twenties , it is said , Held 's " drawings were so valued that admirers sent him blank checks with their requests for an original . " Thirty years later he was unknown to the new younger generation . In an obituary in the yearbook of a club to which Held belonged in New York , a historian who was a friend of his wrote : " John 's pictures reflect an entire era , ... It was not a happy one , and John knew it .... It is doubtful if any document or artifact we have so sharply points the mad temper of the time . ... As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes he would appear shrouded with gloom , would tell you how obviously the world was on the chutes , but then , if you agreed with him , he would abruptly reverse himself and become a champion of silver linings . " His drawings are self-contradictory too , especially his most famous ones in which the criticism of manners and morals is overlaid with a kind of dashing facility . The fact of the matter seems to be that Held was too good a humorist to be a satirist . There was not enough acid in his blood to make him bitter . No matter how he frowned with one part of his face he was unable to conceal that he was smiling indulgently with some other part of it .
