txt FOCUS on business What 's ahead ... A Pandora 's box full of wage-price hikes bigger than Washington wanted may have just flopped open . If so , it was made of aluminum . Aluminum producers this week handed the union a wage hike higher ( 4.1 percent ) than President Johnson 's guidelines ( 3.2 percent ) , then promptly hoisted prices 3 percent . What bothers Washington is that steel now may follow suit  --  and give the economy a jolt . Aluminum workers are represented by the steel union . And now that steel workers have seen what aluminum workers have won  --  and what auto workers even earlier won  --  they will want the same . If they get it , that may make it doubly hard for other industries to hold the 3.2 line . Central Florida is fascinated by a 40,000-acre mystery now mounting south of Orlando . Some firm , still secret , is buying up the land . It has spent $5 million already in partial payment . And it is handling everything through a Swiss bank . Rumors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hercules Powder Company , and Lockheed and North American Aircraft . A big plant by perhaps one of these is predicted . It might employ as many as 5,000 . A second major facility  --  perhaps tied in with the first  --  is also hovering in Orlando 's future . That one is for the Atomic Energy Commission . If it comes off it will employ another 2,000 . Trends ... Germany , a military scourge only two decades ago , more and more is lending others an economic hand . West Germany now stands just behind the United States and France in the amount of official resources it funnels to developing countries and world agencies . Its outward flow of combined private and state aid since 1961 has mushroomed to equal the United Kingdom 's . Some of this streams out in war reparations . Yet large chunks of it are tied to German exports . And as West Germany 's economic position burgeons even more , its role as a helper of developing nations is bound to grow too . ED West German economic aid may be edging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor are sliding down . In 1963 , and to a lesser degree in 1964 , the terms of trade between rich and poor were beginning to improve . A heavy volume of commodity exports was helping the have-not countries experience a relatively buoyant two years . But now commodity prices are dipping down again ' and the terms of trade are sliding with them . The two-thirds of the globe 's population that live in the developing nations face possibly harder times . American Vietnam policy may not be going over big in Moscow , but its double-breasted blazers are . So are silk suits , tuxedoes , and overcoats made of synthetic fibers  --  a la American . An American firm has hit Moscow with a display of the latest in sophisticated American men 's fashion . And it 's the rage . Former Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev was fond of Italian haberdashery . And so for a long time the fashion of the Verkhushka  --  the summit of the party  --  was Italian .

How and why . . . There 's something else the Soviet Union and Communist China do n't agree about  --  the American dollar . Peking believes  --  at least hopes  --  it is headed for a downgrading in relation to gold . But one of Moscow 's top currency experts , Prof. Georgy Lopatin , has said nothing of the sort is possible . He insists that the French scheme  --  to displace the dollar-based international monetary system with one based on gold  --  is impractical . He argues that the volume of world trade is so big the gold standard would cause the price of gold to double or treble . This would be unacceptable to the United States , says Professor Lopatin . And the United States possesses enough economic power to stop any tampering with the gold price . It 's a view that lies a far cry from Peking's.               @ @ @ @ @ @
