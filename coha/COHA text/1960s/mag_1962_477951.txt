WHEN I was a boy in Oregon , life was organized around the seasons . Next to the mammoth winter preparations , I suppose our greatest activity was organizing for summer at the beach . Since we spent three to four months there each year , including visits in spring and winter , Mother had to be certain that things were in order for every possible emergency . My father , who did n't enjoy life at the beach , could be expected to join us only for an occasional weekend . A huge trunk journeyed back and forth from Portland to the beach , along with an enormous packing case of general supplies , for Mother felt there was nothing in the stores near our destinat ion but inferior merchandise . Thus , she would make a special visit to the paper company for the sole purpose of buying a summer 's supply of waxed paper , wrapping paper , and toilet tissue . Then she would commence to select food to be packed and shipped ? such staples as dried beans and rice , spices and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She hated the musty smell which linens took on when stored at the beach , so there were fresh linens to be sent , too , and new dishes . Two or three days before we left , the household was in a tumult . A ham was being cooked , a batch of bread was baking , and miscellaneous tidbits were being prepared to see us through the first two or three meals . All of this was stored in a large willow picnic hamper . Then our clotheswere packed , the bags were closed , and the express man came to collect everything and check it through to Gearhart . I have gone to Europe for a year 's stay with less packing and far less strain . Finally the clay arrived . In the early morning Mother fixed a luncheon to take along , although the train left at 8:30 and we arrived at the beach shortly after noon . You never knew who might be on the train , and a few sandwiches and cookies would be just the thing . Usually this meant thin slices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandwiches , and perhaps a tidy pound cake . Mr. McKiernan arrived to drive us to the old Spokane , Portland , and Seattle station . This railroad had a branch line on which the train tore down along the bank of the Columbia River to Astoria at the astonishing rate of twenty miles an hour or better . We rode in the same venerable parlor cars year after year , and the porters were like members of the family . We had to arrive at the station early or I made a frightful scene , for it was absolutely vital that I have a certain chair on the observation platform . Oh , what train travel lost when the observation platform went out ! I have never enjoyed trains as much as I did then , sitting in the open air getting covered with coal dust and clinkers . I had a feeling of personal contact with the world passing by ? as if I were touring the countryside on my back porch . The first stop of any importance was Rainier on the river . Mother had friends in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our arrival , and they always came clown to the station to pass a few minutes of pleasantry . Then we set off again , and before long we were unpacking the sandwiches , especially if friends of mine were aboard . Children and mothers alike shared our picnic , the porters brought us ginger ale , and there was a festive aft about the entire trip . Beyond Astoria at the mouth of the Columbia River , where sometimes more friends were on hand to greet us , we went over an endless trestle spanning Young 's Bay . This thrilled me beyond words , for it was just like going to sea . Gearhart was on the coast about eighteen miles below the mouth of the Columbia River . It was a heavenly spot with lush timber : beautiful meadows ; a wide white beach delightful for walking . driving , or riding ; and a tossing . roaring surf perfect for bathing . It was , and still is , a unique little community . for its commercial life has been kept at a minimum , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it continues to have a sort of isolated charm that attracts the same type of people who lived there when I was a child , and many of the houses are occupied by the families who built them , soon after the turn of the century . Our first year there was 190$ , and in 1910 we built a small house in what was then considered a rather remote part of the meadow . It is still not too built up . No place I have ever been gives me quite as much pleasure . I adore the ocean , the sand , the solitude . Mother would have written asking the Tybergs or William Badger to have the house opened and to meet us and pick up the trunks and assorted packages . It was like the arrival of a celebrated prima donna . As soon as we reached the house there was the fuss of getting unpacked , getting a fire going , getting a bit of lunch ready ? invariably , it seems to me , cold ham and pickles , bread and butter , and cheese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , and by evening it was so well organized we might never have been away at all . We would have a long walk on the beach to see if its familiar contours had been altered . Most likely there would be a dinner invitation for us , and people we knew began to drop by . Among them were sure to be the Hamblet family . The Hamblets were close friends of my mother 's and so interlaced with our gastronomic life that I must pause to introduce them here . Harry Hamblet was a New Englander , a man of medium height and comfortable proportions and the most thoroughly generous and outgoing man 1 think I ever knew . His wife , who became known to my generation of Portlanders as " Grammie. " was one of my mother 's intimate friends over a period of more than fifty years . And the last Hamblet ? Mary ? is still one of my best friends ? another friendship of over fifty years . T 0 SA Y that the Beards and Hamblets ate hundreds of meals together is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food this part of the world was for us ! The sandy soil was perfection for vegetables and small fruits ; the evening clew and the temperate climate were good for growing and ripening . The nearby waters provided an inexhaustible supply of fish . The Columbia River abounded with salmon , sturgeon , and halibut ; and the ocean with the small turbot , grunions , and a tremendous variety of small fish . The Pacific 's greatest blessing , though , was the Dungeness crab , to my mind unequaled by anything in the shellfish world . ( I will match a good Dungeness against the best lobster in America and against the best langouste in Europe . ) In addition to the crab , there were the superb razor clams , which flourished in the days of our beaching and co i nt.nue in small supply nowadays ? definitely a sportsman 's catch . They have a rich flavor , somewhat akin to scallops , and a delicacy of texture that is different from any other clam I know . And they are larger than most clams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So distinctive are they , that one should have them cooked as simply as possible in order to savor their natural goodness . We also had mussels by the ton , but there is something in the water or the life cycle of this mollusk which makes them inedible in the West for a long season of the year . This greatly upset Mother , who had a passion for mussels and who looked longingly whenever we saw them clinging to the rocks . In the rivers and streams around us there were also thousands of small crawfish , trout , pogies ( not to be confused with the Eastern porgies ) , tom cod , catfish of a type , and other delights . It 's no wonder we existed almost entirely on the riches of the rivers and i he sea . Harry Hamblet was interested in the first oyster beds to transplant Eastern oysters to the Pacific Coast . As a result , bags of oysters arrived each week from not too distant Shoalwater Bay , and these added to our bounty . One of my memories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , cooking dozens of freshly opened oysters in butter by the pound . There were two big iron skillets going . The oysters were floured , dipped in egg and cracker crumbs , and cooked quickly in deep butter till golden on both sides . The butter was not hot enough to black them , and the oysters were not deep fried but merely saut ? ed just fast enough to heat them through . A squeeze of lemon and some freshly ground pepper was all they needed , together with a garnish of bacon and crisp buttered toast . On such occasions I 'm certain that more than a dozen oysters were consumed by each person . Anyone who says you should never cook an oyster has never tasted these after a long walk along the beach in the sea air . They were ambrosial , and this is n't just nostalgia , for I tried them again lately to see ! Sometimes after an early morning session of clamming we had a breakfast of fried clams , fresh from the sands . The razor clam spits through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As soon as one of us spotted this marker , he took a shovelful of sand , then fell to his knees and searched the sand until he struck the clamshell . Sometimes it was a struggle to bring a clam to the surface , so strong was its digging power . A take of five to six dozen in a morning was not unusual . Mother thought clamming a great sport and would arise at five in the morning when there was a good low tide , don her best alpaca bathing suit , and be off to the beach equipped with shovel and basket . She would meet a number of friends there , mostly men , for few women would bother to go clamming . I often went with her in later years , but my special joy at first was crabbing . The Dungeness used to hide in deep pools accessible at low tide , and if you wandered through with a rake you could trap a fair quantity . You had to be alert , though , and early ? for everyone else wanted them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lemon-conned and add to them 1 cup minced clams which have been drained . Blend with 1 cup toasted bread crumbs , I teaspoon salt , dash tabasco . Add enough clam juice or milk to make a heavy batter , and lastly fold in the egg whites , stiffly beaten . Drop by spoonfuls into a well-buttered heavy skillet and bake till nicely browned on both sides . Serve with butter or with a tartar sauce . Thus , we often went home with five dozen clams and six or eight crabs . If she was in the mood Mother would clean a dozen or so clams and remove the diggers , which she brushed with flour and sauteed quickly in butter until heated through and not particularly golden . Most people cooked the whole clam . Mother was independent enough to think that only the diggers were fit to eat in this manner ; the rest of the clam could be used for other dishes . Nowadays , alas , you are lucky if you can get the clams to saute in their entirety . I am certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recipes for them would be classic . As it is , such people as Helen Evans Brown , Catharine Laughton , and I go on singing their praises . CLAMS AND CRABS M OTHER took a dim view of the average clam chowder , as did the Hamblets . The one we all loved was magnificently creamy and filled with the smokiness of bacon and the piquancy of thyme . The clams and their juice were added at the moment of serving , and this timing , together with the seasoning , made it , we thought , better than any other chowder on the beach . Clam broth we had by the quart . The portion of the clams she did n't use for saut ? ing were tossed into a large pot together with their shells , onions , celery , carrots , parsley , and water to cover . She allowed this to steep for an hour or so till the concentrated flavor of the clams had permeated the broth . This was strained and served hot in small cups or chilled with a tiny bit of salted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a base for soups and sauces , bestowing a flavor that was wonderfully delicate . The same , less choice portions of the clam were sometimes minced . This was made into the lightest of fritters , served with a genuine tartar sauce ? not a concoction with some dill pickle and garlic added . Our scalloped clams , another delight , were made with cracker crumbs ( not cracker meal , but rather coarse crumbs of good unsalted soda crackers ) , clams , butter , milk , cream , egg , chopped parsley , and that was all . Sometimes Mother would use much the same base and add beaten egg whites to make a form of souffle I have never had anywhere else . It was puffy , subtly flavored with clam , and as airy a dish as ever existed . And this was baked in the oven of a wood stove , which was like a pet to my mother ; she could almost tell it what to do . Escalloped Clams Combine 3 tablespoons grated onion . 2 cups minced drained clams , Y4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dash of tabasco . Combine 14 cup bread crumbs and 1 cup coarsely crushed cracker crumbs with 1,5 cup melted butter . Blend well . Reserve of the mixture . Combine the rest with the clam mixture and spoon into a buttered baking dish or casserole . Top with remaining buttered crumbs , dot with butter , and pour 1 " -= heavy cream over all . Bake for about 25 minutes in a 375 ? oven till top is nicely browned and crisp . The trouble with American gastronomy is that the tradition of regional eating has been ruined during this century . Everyone thinks he must have Maine lobster in Oregon and California asparagus in New York , and so it goes . What a job it is to find a restaurant ? and they are rare ? where the pleasures of regional food are still respected . Dungeness crab is now sent across the country , but to eat it freshly cooked and to eat it after refrigeration are two different experiences . And to cat it frozen after it has traveled the breadth of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant in San Francisco ? Big Ben , to be exact ? where the crab is cooked and never refrigerated , merely cooled , and the flavor speaks for itself . One can also get crab fresh from the boilers along Fisherman 's Wharf in San Francisco and in shops in Oregon . If you allow these to cool and eat them with a rich homemade mayonnaise , good bread and butter , and beer or a very light white wine , you will have a meal that the gods intended only for the pure in palate . And to have Grammie Hamblet 's deviled crab ! I have maintained all my life that this is the best cooked crab I have ever known . It is made with finely chopped , crisp vegetables , cracker crumbs and butter , and it is seasoned well and cooked just long enough to heat the crabmeat without turning it mushy . Served with a very brisk wine ? a Muscadet or a Chablis ? it is indescribably good , for there is the luscious flavor of the crabmeat in a crisp cadre . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having thought that one up ! A SEASON OF SALMON W E HAD salmon during the entire season . Harry Hambkt and the Peter Grants saw to that . The Grants were in the cannery business and commuted all summer between the plant in Astoria and Gearhart . Grammie Hamblet 's Deviled Crab Chop enough celery to make 1 cup . It must be cut finer than fine . Add I good-sized green pepper cut exceedingly fine . 1 cup finely sliced green onions , Y2 cup chopped parsley , 2 pounds cralmaeat , 21,4 cups coarsely crushed cracker crumbs . 1 teaspoon salt , 114 teaspoons dry mustard , a healthy dash tahasco , 1.4 cup heavy cream , and I cup melted butter . Toss lightly and spoon into a buttered baking dish . Top with additional crushed cracker crumbs and brush with melted butter . Bake at 350 ? for 25-30 minutes or until delicately browned . Serve at once . About once a week they would ask if we wanted a fish , and that night a salmon would arrive , caught the same morning , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the HambIets and Beards preferred to almost anything else in the fish world . The cheeks were easy to get in those days , for no one thought of cutting them out when the heads were removed . Nowadays they are as scarce as white caviar and nearly as expensive , if you can get them . We feasted on them saut6ed in butter or occasionally grilled over the fire . The rest of the salmon we poached , baked , or cut into steaks to grill . The poached was usually accompanied by an egg sauce or a parsley sauce ; the baked was done with onions , tomatoes in season , peppers , and a few rashers of bacon , all of which were served up with the fish . This year in Oregon , I had an extremely tasty baked salmon stuffed with vegetables , covered with layers of cucumber , and topped with a little garlic , dill , and some bacon . Poached Salmon With Egg and Parsley Sauce Choose a 4 to 5 pound piece of salmon from the center of the fish , Wrap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on either side of the fish for some distance so that you can raise it and lower it into the kettle . Prepare a court bouillon in a large kettle which will accommodate the fish . You will need 3 quarts water , 1 cup white wine , a dash of vinegar , an onion stuck willi 2 cloves , a carrot , it sprig of parsley . 2 tablespoons salt , a hay leaf , and 2 or S slices of lemon . Bring to a boil and boil for 10 minutes . Reduce the heat and lower the salmon into the liquid . Poach at a feeble ebullition for about 6 minutes per pound or until the fish flakes easily when tested with a toothpick or fork . Remove the fish to a hot platter . While the fish is cooking , melt 3 tablespoons butter in a skillet and blend with 4 tablespoons flour and cook or two or three minutes . Add 1 cup of the fish liquid and stir until thickened . Season to taste with riff LIFE AT ITS BEST salt and freshly ground black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two egg yolks and stir until it thickens slightly ? do not let it boili Fold in u2 cup sliced hard-boiled eggs and 1,4 cup chopped parsley . Correct the seasoning and serve with the fish , boiled potatoes , and a cucumber salad . Drink a brisk white wine ? a Chablis or a Muscadet . Rhoda 's Baked Salmon Split a 4-5 pound piece of salmon and stuff with thinly sliced onion , tomato , pepper , and few sprigs of parsley . Salt and pepper lightly and add a touch of tarragon . Place I large or 2 small cucumbers sliced in medium slices atop the salmon skin . Add a little chopped garlic and fresh dill . Lay bacon strips across the top and bake in a 350 ' oven for about 55 minutes or until the salmon flakes easily when tested with a fork . Serve with tiny new potatoes and tiny French peas . Almost any way you treat a fresh Columbia salmon , it is good , but it must not be overcooked . It should be moist , tender , and just cooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety of salmon and learned a number of ways to prepare it . It is a fish with great distinction , and I feel it has never had the acclaim in this country it deserves . Too many people think of it as something that comes from a can or is sold smoked . How delicious it was when I had it as the Indians used to do it , barbecued or smoked over an open fire , attached to a forked spirea branch which wo n't burn , or spitted and roasted over charcoal or wood coals . Or how good it was prepared with a souffl ? mixture , which was poached and served with a mousseline sauce ; or when poached and served cold with a sauce verte or a simple tarragon mayonnaise . Smoked salmon varies in quality a good deal , and the Scots and the Swedes have done the best with the smoking process , to my mind , with the Irish a runner-up . The salmon of these people is firm and pungent . Most of the Nova Scotia is too soft , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or too hot-smoked , so that is resembles a kippered rather than a smoked fish . There should be a standard set up for judging smoked fish so that one need n't shop around for a reliable piece . Ironically , good grades are even hard to track down in New York , where probably more smoked salmon is eaten than its any other city in the world . Kippered salmon , which is smoke-cooked , can be as great a delicacy as the smoked salmon if properly done . There , I think , the Northwest kipper people come through with the best product , providing they do not stoop to the horror of artificial smoke . It is a delectable bit when cut thin and served with a mustard mayonnaise or a dill sauce and eaten with rye bread and beer . It is also good heated in foil and served with butter and boiled potatoes for breakfast or lunch . SPECIALS FOR COMPANY T H E trout deserves the praise it gets . In Switzerland and the Alpine section of France , live trout are tossed into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as great as any piscatorial delight ? Trtsite 071 Bleu . This is usually offered with melted butter or a hollandaise . We seldom had trout this classic way in Gearhart , because they were generally brought to us by fishing friends who came down late in the morning from their jaunts . Thus , we would have a simple , impromptu lunch , the trout being served meuni ? re or cooked in a coating of cornmeal with bacon . I have been severely chastized by a **30;1874;TOOLONG for even mentioning the idea of bacon and trout together . But is it any more improbable to acid the flavor of bacon than to add lemon or vinegar , as in Truite au Bleu ? I hope someday to have the chance to offer this critic a perfectly saut ? ed mountain trout with bacon . I 'm certain he will eat it with gusto , protesting the while that it should n't he . We had much company at the beach . Good friends of Mother 's would come to stay for a week or two , and there would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret of a good blue trout is a live trout . It must be gutted and tossed into the sharp bouillon of vinegar and water , with salt and peppercorns , while it is still jumping . The proportions for the trout are about 1 part vinegar to 3 parts water , and salt arid peppercorns are all you need ? although you might toss in a small onion and a sprig of parsley without being called a non-classic cook . Cover the trout and cook for 4-5 minutes or until the fish is just cooked through . It will have developed a delightful bluish tinge when cooked . Serve this delicacy with melted butter and lemon juice and plain boiled potatoes . Drink a light white wine ? perhaps a Swiss one . walks , and picnics . We lived informally , and there was little punctuality about mealtimes unless guests had been invited in advance , or something very special , such as a poached salmon , was on the menu . Then , God help you if you were late . Breakfast , Mother and I usually had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already been clamming , crabbing , or swimming , by seven o'clock or seven-thirty we were ravenously hungry . We might have saut ? ed clams for ourselves or clam fritters , sour milk griddle cakes with bacon , or scrambled eggs with bacon . If Mother were in the mood , she might make popovers , which she did with a flair , and these would be eaten with fresh jam and probably a boiled egg . I could easily manage three of the light puffs and was then quite happy to set out for an adventure at the beach or in the woods . Luncheon , if we were home and not picnicking in the woods , might be just cracked crab with Mother 's fine mayonnaise , or a crab salad with finely shredded young cabbage , a tiny hit of celery , a touch df onion , and plenty of good crabmeat ? two parts crab to one of vegetables , tossed with a judicious amount of mayonnaise . This was fantastically good eating and was often served as a company lunch , along with legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We had big peach-blossom Chinese howls for salads , and the dish looked extremely handsome as it was brought to table . With this lunch went thin homemade bread and butter , or hot rolls or muffins , and fresh fruit , a tart , or one of Mother 's quick coffee cakes . Another favorite lunch for guests was a huge piece of cold salmon which had been pickled with vinegar , oil , bay leaves , peppercorns , lots of sliced onion , and a tittle garlic , as well as some of the broth in which the fish was cooked . This was drained and arranged on a platter with chopped parsley and chives , thinly sliced cucumber and tomato , if in season . A mayonnaise was served with this , and it was accompanied by homemade bread and sometimes a vegetable salad , in addition to the cucumber . If good fruit was available , there would be a fruit tart for dessert , or there might be a souffl ? . One year our rich next-door neighbors , who always maintained a staff of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invited us to lunch , arrived with a fine French cook . Julie took a great fancy to Mother and gave her tips on shopping and on managing with a beach kitchen . And when she made souffles she would often make two and have one rushed next door to our table . She made a pineapple souffle such as I have never eaten since , and on one rare occasion we had picked enough wild strawberries for a souffle . This turned out to be a heavenly , once in a lifetime treat . It was Julie who , in collaboration with Mother , first produced the highly successful . clam souffle , Julie 's Souffle Mixture Blend 3 tablespoons flour with 3 tablespoons melted butter . and stir well and cook for 3.4 minutes over medium heat . Stir in 4 cup milk or other liquid and stir till thickened . Cool slightly , add 4 egg yolks , and return to heat for two or three minutes , stirring well . Add flavorings and cool slightly . Finally add 5 or 6 egg whites beaten stiff but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or in the electric heater if you have one with a whisk attachment . If you fold by hand or spatula fold in ' 4 of the whites very thoroughly . Then add the other more lightly but do not leave great chunks of white in the hatter . Pour into a or 2 quart container ? it does not need to be the official souffl ? form ? and bake at 400 ? for 25-90 minutes . depending upon the firmness you desire in a souffl ? . The most important thing is not to have any fear of a souffle . It is a simple process , and if you learn once to be casual about it there can never be a failure . Folding is important , and once you get the feel of a souffle into your fingers by folding by hand , you will know the quality of batter that makes a good souffle . Test the souffl ? in the oven by gently pressing with your hand to determine the firmness inside . Some people like a firm souffle , and others prefer one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some souffles will vary in the number of egg whites and egg yolks for one reason or another . This is precisely the way the originator wanted the souffl ? , and it has proved itself over a period of years and should remain that way . Julie 's Pineapple Souffle Prepare the basic souffl ? mixture above but add 6 egg yolks and 14. , cup sugar and cook over medium heat till well blended and thick . Stir in cup crushed drained pineapple , 1 teaspoon vanilla , and a pinch of salt . Beat 8 egg whites and fold them in according to directions given above . Butter a 2 quart souffl ? dish and sugar it well . Pour the mixture in the mold and bake at 400 ? for 35 minutes or until the souffl ? is firm enough for your taste . Serve with a sauce of melted vanilla ice cream ? an easy and perfectly delicious sauce fur souffles . If we had a meat dish , which was not too often , it might he a meat pie with kidney and vegetables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasonal vegetables in the broth and plenty of marrow bones . Potatoes in their jackets were the proper accompaniment , and the extra beef was pressed and made into cold cuts used in a salad . Occasionally a piece of corned beef from Portland provided a pleasant change of fare . It was ideal for picnic sandwiches or as a snack for supper . And sometimes Mother would come by a fine fowl , procured from the people who sold eggs , and this would make a rich fricassee , or it was used for Mother 's special smothered chicken ? a type of daube ? in which the chicken was browned and put to simmer with vegetables , seasonings and liquid , to which cream and thickening was added . The vegetables were removed and served separately , along with boiled potatoes in jackets , or rice . This dish could last for a couple of days if the weather was right , for refrigeration at the beach was somewhat primitive . Our Beach Fricassee of Chicken Cut a large fowl into serving pieces . Make separate pieces of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sections . probably , and have the wings separate . The back and the ribs make three pieces , too . You should have an extra package of backs , necks , and gizzards to make a rich broth . Two pounds of necks and 2 of gizzards with 2 quarts of water , an onion stuck with cloves and salt , should make a good rich chickeny broth which has so many uses . We always seemed to have a great jar of it in the ice box or cooler . Make a bed of greens rut into matchlike sticks on the bottom of the kettle in which you are to rook the chicken . Three leeks , 2 carrots . 1 large onion , 2 stalks celery , several sprigs of parsley , and a teaspoon of thyme should be in the mixture . Arrange chicken pieces on this and add 1,4 cup oil , yl cup white wine , and enough broth to cover the vegetables and touch the chicken pieces . Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt and a little freshly ground black pepper . Cover tightly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stove at medium heat until the chicken is just tender ? close to 2 hours . About 20 minutes before the chicken has finished cooking . cook 2 cups of rice in 41/4 cups chicken broth . Bring the broth to a boil , add the rice , and bring to a boil again . Salt to taste , cover and put on very low heat for 13 minutes . Test for doneness and check whether the rice has absorbed the broth . Brown 2 tablespoons flour in 3 tablespoons butter , gradually stir in 2 cups rich chicken broth from the pan in which the chicken cooked , and continue stirring till the mixture is blended and thick . Cook for 2 minutes , add 1 cup cream mixed with 3 egg yolks and stir until thickened , but do not let boil . Taste for seasoning . Add some chopped parsley and serve with the chicken and rice . Sometimes we added tiny green olives to the sauce . Supper was an uncertain affair . We might have a simple meal of eggs and cheese or a cold snack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or toast ant/ marmalade . If we went picnicking at the beach , it was a brisk but heavy meal . Often we 'd sup with the Harnblets or the Marias family , who were numerous and who would have a crowd of guests besides for an evening of food , music , and conversation . So went our pattern of beach living . CARDINAL WOLSEY 'S DISH M OTHER was critical of the way most people lived at the beach , looked down her nose at the food served in other houses , and , except for meals with the Hamblet family , she usually refused invitations to cat out . " No use giving up the pleasures of eating just because you 're on vacation , " she would say . " Who wants to eat a lot of horrible stuff out of jars and cans and that ghastly baker 's bread which tastes like cotton batting ? To hell with it . I 'd rather have a cup of tea and some of my own bread and cracked crab than eat all that stuff that 's bound to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and two or three good friends who would share our house for a fortnight or so seemed to have noses for wild berries . Mother and Grammie Hamblet , especially . They could almost scent it in the air when the wild strawberries were just right , and off they 'd go with the rest of us in tow , all laden with buckets . Five- and three-pound lard pails made superb berry containers in those days . The wild strawberries at Gearhart and up the beach took hours to gather , but they were so good that no one seemed to mind . They grew on long stems , similar to the European fraises des bois , and had a sugary , wild flavor that has lingered on my palate all these years . Occasionally in Spain or in the remote parts of France , where the fraises des bois are not cultivated to tasteless pulp , one finds the same flavor , and in the countryside and mountains of the Northwest and sometimes in New England one discovers them in small quantities . No one has experienced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these or tasted a good preserve made with them . Fortnum and Mason have clone a superb job of bottling little scarlet berries in preserve , and I urge you to send for some or buy some the next time you are in London . Incidentally , only strawberries of the wild variety grew in England until the sixteenth century , and it was an Englishman , Cardinal Wolsey , who started the fad of eating strawberries with cream . Mother was deeply indebted to him ; she loved to skim heavy cream from a pan of milk onto a plate of berries . During our berry jaunts , we would also find yellowish-pink salmon berries , These were good enough to eat from the vine , my mother pronounced , but not good enough to carry home ? too gross in flavor . The same thing went for the thimble berry , a variety of wild raspberry . Blue huckleberries were the most elusive of the wild berries . They usually grew in places difficult to reach , in the midst of a mountain wilderness . But once you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they were prepared ? in a deep dish pie , which we had often ; or in a strange English version of the agoutis , with a batter poured over the berries and baked ; or in little dumplings which were dropped into cooked huckleberries ? they were fantastically good . No cultivated blueberries ever tasted as good . I think it was the slow maturing and the fact that they grew in deep forests which made the wild variety so exceptional . Once years after my beach days when I was working with a restaurant , I opened a great container of frozen berries from Canada , and even through the freeze , the wonderful scent of wild huckleberries reached me . How I longed for a berry patch then . Another berry much prized by us were mountain blackberries , which have now been distributed through the country by a firm ? in its infancy when I was young ? called Dickinson 's . These wild brambles flourish in logged-over land and trailed through all sorts of terrain . Since there was a good deal of logged-out land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One could get rather torn and scratched gathering these tiny blackberries , but they were well worth the trouble . They were too tart to eat in any quantity from the vine , but in jam and jelly and tarts and pies they were exceedingly delicious . We usually had the blackberries baked with a top crust only , or we would go to the Hamblets for a two-crust pie , which Grammie Hamblet made with great flair . Or we would feast on sour-milk pancakes for breakfast generously covered with freshly made blackberry jam . Sometimes the pancakes would be made large , buttered , spread with jam , and rolled , then brushed with more butter , sprinkled with sugar , and put into the oven for a few minutes . Mary Hamblet practically lived on her horse ? her sister and brother spent as much time on theirs ? and the trio would come prancing down to our house to announce the discovery of a new patch of berries or the fact that there had been a good catch of crab , and how many could we use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are rare these days . BIGGEST FIVE CENTS T HREE miles from Gearhart was a bustling resort , Seaside , quite the opposite of our reserved community . There were shops , amusements , dance halls , restaurants , and hundreds of tourists . People there lived in cottages built close to one another and without the splendid isolation that Gearhart provided . At any rate , we had many friends there and often spent the day , visit . ing , seeing a movie , then taking the late train back , or walking the three miles at night with a spirit of adventure . One place in Seaside fascinated all of us children , and drew us back each time we were in town . This was West 's Dairy , where they made a five-cent milk shake , which resembled the gronitas of Italy and offered twenty-eight different flavors . We always resolved to sample each of the flavors before the season was over . I doubt that we ever made it , although we 'd invade West 's five at a time , order five flavors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? claret ! wild blackberry ! tutti-frutti ! grenadine ! blue huckleberry ! cherry ! pistachio ! I can see the soda jerks now scraping ice from a tremendous block , putting it in a mixing glass , adding the flavor and then whole milk . It was probably the biggest five cents worth of anything I ever had , and it was good . Needless to say , that was the only time I drank milk . These days on the Oregon shore were among the most memorable in my life . I can remember several occasions when an equinoctial storm came up suddenly , catching us still on the beach . I reveled in being out in the driving rain and high winds and in watching the surf go wild . It was equally exciting to scurry home , draw the shutters and sup on good food while listening to the wind and beating rain . When the storm had passed , it left a calm of indescribable beauty . I would rush out to the beach to see if any damage had been done to the other houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been washed ashore . Then for complete peace there was nothing like the week between Christmas and New Year 's when we stayed at the beach . Few houses would be open , and the sense of removal from the rest of the world was even stronger . Mother kept certain items stored in the house for this off-season visit , but as always , we went to the sea for our food , and it sustained us perfectly .
