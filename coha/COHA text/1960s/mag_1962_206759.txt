THE CONQUEST OF LONDON ( 465 pp. ) and THE MIDDLE YEARS ( 408 pp . ) , Vols . II &; III of HENRY JAMES-Leon Edel -- Lippincoft ( $ 17 ) . <P> <P> Boswell started it all . Ever since the canny Scot earned himself a niche in history by taking over Dr. Johnson , scholars have been trying to identify themselves with one literary personality big enough to make their reputations . The best and easiest way to own a famous figure is to find or obtain title to his private papers and write the definitive biography . With authority ( and possession ) thus established , it is relatively easy to mine and remine the slag heap , bringing out successive editions of his major works , followed by volumes of letters or previously ( and perhaps wisely ) unpublished fragments of his early work . <P> In the old days , once a biographer-critic got on top of a really big writing name he was likely to stay there for a lifetime . But today , scholarly competition is cutthroat , and the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an elephant carcass is swarmed over by ants , each one fruitfully busy but no one bigger than the next . Nevertheless , some hardy scholars can justly lay claim to authoritative possession of one literary giant or near giant , by virtue of either a brilliant critical study that makes rivals obsolete or research of such exhaustive thoroughness that it discourages competitors . Among them : Edgar Johnson , of New York 's City College , who owns Charles Dickens ; Ernest J. Simmons , who took over Tolstoy with a whopping biography in 1946 , recently became a two-man proprietor when his massive study of Chekhov ( TIME , Oct. 19 ) came out ; Harvard 's Douglas Bush , who has monopolized Milton since 1945 and may set the 20th century endurance record as titleholder , a triumph only slightly tarnished by the fact that Milton can hardly be described as a hotly pursued property . Ex-Proprietor Boswell is himself now possessed by Yale 's renowned scholar Frederick A. Pottle . Yale , in fact , has enough Johnson-Boswelliana to fill Yale Bowl , is probably the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18th in England-as its very own . <P> Squatters and Stampedes . In the slender roster of modern American greats , Scott Fitzgerald was once the property of Arthur Mizener , who helped bring his writings to a new prominence ( TIME , Jan. 29 , 1951 ) . But Fitzgerald is now a contested figure , suspended between Mizener and Andrew Turnbull , author of the recent biographical bestseller ( TIME , March 30 ) . Several critics are even now trying to assert squatters ' rights in the late William Faulkner 's Yoknapatawpha County , but what will become of their rivalry nobody is likely to know for years . Hemingway had no one dominant fan in life . After his death , a stampede of scholars for the right to use his private papers might have been expected . But the great plum was swiftly awarded by his widow to Princeton 's Carlos Baker . As sure as footnotes are footnotes , Baker , now at work on a definitive biography , will be " the Hemingway man .
