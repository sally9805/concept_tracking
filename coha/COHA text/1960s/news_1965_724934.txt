txt Washington When the United States has 125,000-plus troops in South Vietnam what will their tactics be against the Communist guerrillas ? " We will he less static than the South Vietnamese , more aggressive , seek our own surprises , ' and try to be less orthodox , " replies a planner in the Pentagon . Using such tactics many officers are confident that as they enlarge their areas of command in Vietnam they can push the scale of warfare back to small-unit guerrilla war , and keep the South Vietnamese position from deteriorating further . Aviation is their tactical center piece . The experimental First Cavalry Division ( air-mobile ) with its 434 helicopters offers greater mobility than the conventionally transported divisions it joins in Vietnam . This aerial striking force is only the beginning . President Johnson 's decision to build up American strength in South Vietnam has just brought three battalions of the 101st Airborne Division to South Vietnam . Numerous new helicopter companies will be sent over . the new forces ( These new there will be a ment . ) Assuming that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not appear over the coming year , what f011ows - is-  a -- composite discussion of " the coming war " from many military sources wrestling with the tactical problem : Sweeps of 1,000 or more men as a unit searching for the Viet Cong have seldom succeeded . Last week 's sweep , for example , turned up few guerrillas . Veterans who have fought the Communists insist that this is not the way to fight guerrillas in a jungle . At a minimum , however , these sweeps keep the Viet Cong off balance . say United States strategists , and able only to launch small raids . Thus , they add , the sweeps prevent the Viet Cong from grouping into the several regiments and battalions needed for a try at cutting South Vietnam in half . If the Americans are willing to commit large numbers of their 125,000-plus force into direct , aggressive guerrilla warfare , say many veterans of the fighting , they should be carefully used as small units . Coastal enclaves These veterans would divide the troops into units of 10 men , give them rations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helicopter in search of guerrillas . But this could take large numbers of troops . Can 125,000 , or even 250,000 , make this possible in any planned way ? Or will it be necessary for the Americans to fall back to the coastal enclaves  --  now being prepared  --  and sweep out from them , still using smaller units dropped by helicopters to surprise the Viet Cong ? Or will the top American command discover that the use of small units is impossible and return to the present conventional tactics of using large numbers of troops in sudden sweeps ? Military observers simply do not ' mow . They say only time will tell . Above all , veterans of the fighting argue that a fast reaction to any oncentration of the Viet Cong is indispensable . A good deal of accurate intelligence now is wasted because of the slow-moving South Vietnamese Army . Men who have fought in Vietnam are convinced that nation 's army has been trained for a conventional war that does not exist . For instance , they say , South Vietnamese Army headquarters are never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch them carefully and move around them . Sweeping statement Once the United States 125,000-man force is ready the American tactics will be tested . As one officer puts it , " We must take the night away from them . We must patrol aggresively . We must try to dominate their environment . " Such a view is heard over and over again among the American officers . As one puts it , " We must cut the guerrillas ' links with the people . We must deny them food , clothing , munitions , medicine , information , and intelligence , recruits , protection , money . " This is a sweeping statement . But unless the Viet Cong can actually be separated from these elements , United States Army experts feel they can not bring the Communists to a stalemate . How many troops will President Johnson be willing to invest in South Vietnam if the Viet Cong can not be held at bay by 125,000 to 200,000 United States soldiers ? The answer is still speculative . In the Pentagon at the moment officers feel the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stem the Communist tide without reaching a Korea-size war .
