To the tourist in India , the magician 's rope trick is merely another clever demonstration that the hand is quicker than the eye . To Professor Mircea Eliade of the University of Chicago divinity school , the fakir 's fakery is the vestige of an ancient religious rite with highly symbolic overtones : the rope is an image of the " astral cord , " symbolizing the link between earth and sky , man and heaven . Originally , the trick was intended to prove to spectators the existence of an unknown and mysterious world ; by climbing the rope and then temporarily disappearing , the conjurer revealed the possibility of man 's transcending this world for the " real " but hidden world of the sacred . <P> In the subtle art of establishing the sacred origin of profane events , Rumanian-born Scholar Eliade has no peer . A pipe-smoking polymath who speaks six languages and writes fluently in three , Eliade , 58 , is a prolific novelist as well as chairman of Chicago 's history of religion department .

Jerald Brauer , dean of Chicago 's divinity school , and other scholars compare Eliade 's works to those of the modern pioneer of myth collection , Sir James Frazer ( The Golden Bough ) . Unlike Frazer , an agnostic who deplored the mindless cruelty and superstition of pagan legends , Eliade , a Greek Orthodox Christian , comprehends ancient mythology as religious man 's existential effort to understand the mystery of the universe . Little known outside university circles , Eliade has had a profound influence on a number of younger theologians-notably Emory 's Thomas J. J. Altizer , one of the leading " death of God " thinkers . Another Eliade enthusiast was the late Paul Tillich , who for three years ran a joint seminar with him at Chicago on theology and the history of religion . <P> Mystic Light .

One example is the widespread experience of the " mystic light , " such as that of a sober-minded , 19th century New York City businessman who was ecstatically converted to Christ after a dream in which he was suffused with light . Eliade shows how many otherwise disparate faiths offer similar experiences of the " inner light . " Although defined and explained differently by various religions , these experiences all represent radical breaks with normal existence , taking man out of his ordinary life and projecting him " into a universe different in quality , an entirely different world , transcendent and holy . " Beginning with a quotation from Goethe 's Faust , another essay in the book explores the widespread legend that God and the Devil were brothers , and relates it to the equally ancient conception of the androgyne ( hermaphrodite ) as a mystical symbol of wholeness ; both stories , Eliade argues , represent man 's prephilosophic attempt to reconcile the existence in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
