One cause of the growing shortage of college teachers is a " crisis in values " that has infected a generation of young scholars with " the crassest opportunism in grantsmanship , job hopping and wheeling-dealing . " So writes John W. Gardner , president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching , in his annual report . <P> Many professors , says Gardner , think that " students are just impediments in the headlong search for more and better grants , fatter fees , higher salaries , higher rank . " Catering to these professors , universities often relieve them of almost all teaching . " Needless to say , such faculty members do not provide the healthiest models for graduates thinking of teaching as a career . " Gardner insists that professors and college officials must " behave as though undergraduate teaching is important . " Typically , they might emulate the salary incentives and status benefits that a few worried universities , such as U.C.L.A. , are offering to faculty members who are notably engrossed with teaching undergraduates.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
