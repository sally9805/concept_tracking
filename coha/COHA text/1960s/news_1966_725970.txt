txt Mayor Lindsay charged yesterday that President Johnson was " shortchanging the cities of America " by cutting $5.3-billion from the Federal budget this week . Most of the cuts came in programs for housing , transportation , poverty and ednen Hon. The Federal Government is spending too much on the war in Vietnam and space programs and not enough on improving the lives of slum-dwellers , the Mayor declared at a City Hall news conference . " If we made a most modest reassessment " in these areas , the Mayor said , " we could do a substantial amount for the cities . " V. ROBERTS F Mr. Lindsay noted that in making his budget reductions last Tuesday the President had said he was cutting only " lowpriority " and " less essential items . " This statement , the Mayor added , " is tragic evidence of a fundamental misunderstanding of the plight of the cities . " " Something is wrong with our national priorities , " the Mayor continued , " when we reduce our commitment to our cities by well over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program virtually intact . " He also reiterated his view that the escalation of the war in Vietnam was not the best road to peace . " The time has come , " the Mayor concluded , " to stop the rhetoric about a ' rebirth of the American cities , ' unless we are willing as a nation to treat that goal as our highest domestic priority . " Mr. Lindsay made most of his comments in response to a reporter 's question , but he was obviously eager to talk on the subject . He read from an extensive prepared statement that was handed to reporters immediately after the news conference . In seeking increased Federal aid for the city the Mayor said he would work closely with the United States Conference of Mayors , which declared on Wednesday that the poor were bearing the major burden of mounting war costs . Mr. Lindsay said the nation 's mayors should " mobilize " a concerted appeal for more funds for urban needs . He has said before that the cities require more aid , but has seldom been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chuckle that there was " general dismay and shock " when he told a Senate subcommittee last August that New York would need $50-billion in Federal aid for the next 10 years . " It appears that I was close to being accurate , " he added . Mortgage Subsidy Cut The Mayor said he did not yet know precisely how New York would be affected by the Federal budget cuts . But he noted that $750-million was cut from funds the Congress had authorized the President to make available for the purchase of mortgages by the Federal National Mortgage Association . This would severly limit the city 's ability to build lower middle-income housing  --  about $25 a room per month  --  under the new Federal mortgage subsidy program , called 221 ( d ) ( 3 ) . This program is considered important for providing reasonable apartments for middle-income families who might otherwise flee to the suburbs.1 Moreover , rent supplements can be used to permit poor ) families to live in developments ' built under the mortgage program . Most experts here feel , however , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President 's and the , Mayor 's promises to make a major attack on slum conditions are doomed if a great deal more Federal money is not available . Edward J. Logue said in a recent report to the Mayor that the city needed $1.5-billion in urban renewal aid alone to make a significant start in eradicating slums . Reason for Refusal Mr. Logue , the administrator of the Boston Redevelopment Authority , turned down the Mayor 's offer to come here largely because he felt New York would not get enough funds to make that start . New York has had a particularly difficult time attracting Federal funds for development . It received only $50-mi1-lion for urban renewal this year , or about 6.6 per cent of the national appropriation , and far less per capita than such cities as Boston and New Haven . Federal officials have in the past been openly critical of the ability of New York 's renewal program to handle more aid . A low opinion of New York 's operation still prevails among Federal authorities , This is a major reason why Mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could coordinate formerly disparate activities and deal directly with Washington . The problem in obtaining funds was also one of the strongest reasons for naming Jason R. Nathan to head the new administration . Mr. Nathan spent nine years in the Federal service and reportedly turned down an offer to become an assistant to Robert C. Weaver , Secretary of Housing ' , and Urban Development , to come New York .
