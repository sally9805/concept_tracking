THE COMMUNITY OF SCHOLARS ( 175 pp. ) - Paul Goodman-Random House ( $3.95 ) . <P> DRAWING THE LINE ( III pp. ) - Paul Goodman-Random House ( $1.50 ) . <P> <P> " The organization of American society , " writes Paul Goodman , 51 , roving lecturer , author and professional dissenter , " is an interlocking system of semi-monopolies notoriously venal , an electorate notoriously unenlightened , misled by mass media notoriously phony , and a baroque state waging cold war against another baroque state . " <P> Before Greece and North Korea , before Hungary or the Berlin Wall , this sort of cumulative indictment might have evoked sage nods and won its author a reputation for fearless thinking . But to a cold war-scarred world , a man who can not tell the difference between Russia and the U.S. seems too unhinged to be tellingly cogent on any other topic . As criticism , it seems a bit like the officer who stops in the midst of battle to dress down a soldier for failing to shave . <P> Still , the officer may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Goodman presses it like the single-minded zealot he is . He calls himself an anarchist-which itself has an old-fashioned ring . He wants to break up America 's big corporations and other mammoth institutions because they have dehumanized life and robbed the individual of his power of decision and sense of purpose . Overorganization , Goodman charges , has dammed up the natural instincts of human beings , which , if released , would make the world a better place . No other American writer of the present time-either of the right or of the left-has so forcefully and persistently championed the individual against the state , and for this reason Goodman has attracted a wide following of people who feel frustrated and helpless and long for the democracy of a simpler day . " Only the anarchists are really conservative , " writes Goodman , " because they want to conserve sun and space , animal nature , primary community , experimenting inquiry . " <P> Unveiling a Tree . In the course of his career , Goodman has made his anarchist 's pitch from many platforms : as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planner , sociologist , psychotherapist , teacher ( mostly at Columbia University ) . He began his fulminations against organized society in his fiction , in which a jumble of ideas is loosely arranged into plots . All the characters talk the same Goodmanese , part slang , part preaching . " Allow me . I will explain it to you " is a typical conversational gambit . Horatio Alger , the hero of Goodman 's biggest novel , The Empire City , pilfers all the cards on file on him in the city , for 20 years prowls about New York in a perfect state of anonymity and anarchy . When an air raid has demolished New York in one of Goodman 's short stories , the survivors agree to build a model society . They launch it by pulling down the last remaining billboard and unveiling a tree while listening , enraptured , to a recording of a Beethoven quartet .
