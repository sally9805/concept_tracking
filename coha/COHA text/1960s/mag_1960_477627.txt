WE WERE walking in the woods out- side a Polish town , just the two of us . I was asking the usual questions . But my companion , a Protestant pastor , was giving unusual answers : " No , no , it is not the dictatorship ; that we always had . It 's the mistrust . We do not tell the truth ; the whole truth , that is . Why not ? Veil ... One of our Church leaders was meeting with some of us old colleagues and we were chiding him for criticizing the West but not the East , and he said , ' Would you like me to give up my post ? ' We all said Oh , no , we needed him precisely where he was because the authorities trust him . ' And they are right to trust me , ' he said , and you , my friends , must let me decide how to speak ? if you want me where I am . It is always a hard decision , and you must pray for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American brings hack from a visit to the churches of Eastern Europe is that of Christians who live in a world much more like Christ 's than his own ; a world where a Christian has to make hard de-cisions and knows it . " It is an interesting time to be alive , " my Polish friend went on , " a very dangerous time , but very interesting . " I remember his words and ask myself : How would an American Christian live dangerously in our time ? He would have to go out of his way and " look for trouble . " The Christian under Communism does n't have to go out of his way . Not that he 's any holier than thou . He does n't make his hard decisions any more eagerly ? or any better ? than he would here . But when he makes them badly , he has a harder time not knowing it . There are time-servers , of course ; men who entered the Church without vocation and study the bishop instead of the Bible . And trimmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who insisted on telling me how free the press is , and a young Church official who party-lined me on the Summit Conference ; but on both occasions their colleagues sat through their monologues in granite silence . My opportunity to do something more than stare at the Communist world arose a year or so ago from a series of intimate little meetings of Eastern and Western ecclesiastics in Europe . My credentials were scandalous ? a non-Christian fellow-traveler of the Quakers ? but nobody bothered to throw me out of the meetings . Whatever Brother Mayer was n't , he was a real , live American who understood a little German ; a curio in such circles . When I was invited to bring my wife and children to one Communist country after another , to live with the brethren and preach among them , I protested the inadequacy of my status , but in vain . So we went . What we saw were Christians living lives unimaginable to the American churchgoer who lives ( or thinks he lives ) as he pleases and bestirs himself about the flooring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never was like ours ? began breaking up in 1914 . Now they live in a new one . This new world requires the Christian Church to collaborate in building an order professing both atheist materialism and the reform of the social conditions that the Church supported for centuries . The Marxists have brought home to the Christians of Eastern Europe the reality of their condition . They are beginning to find out what they can ? and must ? do in the world and what they ca n't do . In Czechoslovakia I talked to a man who had just been discharged as the principal of a school for handicapped children ; in the fall he would have to go back to the classroom as an ordinary teacher again . Had this happened , I asked , solely because of his religion ? " Oh , yes , " he said . " Our school authorities thought an outspoken Christian should not have the general direction of a school in a Marxist state . I said I agreed . And I do agree . I feel that the authorities are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gospel are the two real competitors in the world . Would a Communist be allowed to be a school principal in a Christian country like America ? " In an East German town there was an old pastor whose daughter , just because she was his , was not admitted to the field of university study With his family ; Milton Mayer recently spent more than a year in Europe ? including some time in all of the Communist countries outside the Balkans , This was his fourth extended trip to Europe since 1935 . He is the author of " They Thought They Were Free : the Germans 1933-45 " and is corn . pleting his autobiography , " How I Cot That Way . " He has lectured and preached for twenty years for the American Friends Service Committee ( Quakers ) and was formerly on the faculty of the University of Chicago . This fall he will attend the Christian Peace Conference in Prague , temporarily vacating his chair in the second violin section of the Monterey County ( California ) Symphony Orchestra.for which she had prepared herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but at last we know who we are and what we are here for . We begin to see what is meant by the living Christ . Now we are invincible . " THE ROD OF ANGER F 0 OD grows dearer . Do our brothers grow dearer too ? No ? they freeze and starve beneath our heaven-bent feet . " Thus Thomas Cranmer , " my good and gracious Canterbury , " four hundred years ago . Four hundred years later a priest in Spain watched a shrine burning and said , " The Church forgot the poor ? and now the poor have forgotten the Church . " In the intervening centuries the Reformation of the Church was accomplished and , in the process , some millions of our brothers , already freezing and starving , were burned and butchered in Christ 's name . Now comes Marxist Communism , horning and butchering just like Protestantism and Catholicism in the past . But not in Christ 's name . This much is new . And our freezing and starving brothers ? The American State Department ( a conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the living standard in the Communist countries " is rising slowly , " ' ' has risen slightly , " " has improved a little . " Could this ? this professing Anti-Christ ? be the Profane Reformation , bent so terribly upon accomplishing the alteration of society as the Sacred Reformation accomplished the alteration of the Church ? The Old Testament prophets abound in the possibility : Behold the Assyrian , the rod of mine anger , and the staff in his hand is mine indignation . Could it be ? There are Christians in Europe who are asking themselves if perhaps it is , and if it was n't necessary that it come ; and if it is n't here to stay and to spread wherever our brothers freeze and starve ; and if the world will ever be ( as perhaps it should n't be ) the same again . East of Pest , in Hungary , there still stands a large area of wretched barracks where the capital 's unemployed lived , bred , and died . Directly across the street a large area of handsome apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street , and they are all employed . " Between 1918 and 1938 , " the Communist Mayor of Banskii Bystrica , in Slovakia , told us , " one hundred forty thousand out of three million Slovaks emigrated to look for work . Today we need twenty thousand more workers in this one county alone than we can find . " What did the Church say to the unemployed in Banska or Pest between 1918 and 1938 ? " Our brothers freeze and starve . " " I am not a Communist , I am a Christian , " says Josef Hromadka . " But I know that it is we , we Chris . tians alone , who are responsible for Communism . We had a burden to discharge in the world , and Jesus Christ left us no room to wonder what it was . We failed . We ' said , and did not . ' And now another power has arisen to take up this ' burden . Remember that the Communists once were Christians . If they do not believe in a just God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in Princeton , where he once served so comfortably , but in Prague , where he serves , perhaps less comfortably , as dean pf the Comenius Theological Faculty . All over Eastern Europe one hears the same agonized words from churchmen : " The atheists had to come to teach us the Social Gospel . " Now humility becomes a Christian ? does him proud , you might say . But humiliation is something else . The humiliated Church in Eastern Europe is alien alike to the Christianity of Success and the Communism of Success . Christianity under Communism is the Christianity of Failure . It is un-American . " We reject the Crucifixion , " Hitler 's high priest once said . So , of course , do the Communists . The Christians of Eastern Europe are learning to accept it . It is hard for Western Christians , proud of their innocence , to understand the abjection of their brethren in the East . " So-and-so , " says a prominent American theologian of a new bishop in the East , " is a man with whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guiltless . " What I want to know , " says an American Christian who is fighting Communism over here , " is what they are doing over there to fight Communism . Nothing ? " Nothing . I SHOULD like to have had that guiltless American with me at a county conference of small-town pastors in a village in Hungary . After we had broken goulash together and discUssed this and that , one of the pastors , who had been silent , spoke : " Is n't it true that in America you have many great social problems of crime , and of cultural vulgarity , and of juvenile de-linquency ? " The room was very quiet . " Yes , " I said . " What I want to ask , then , is this : Do Americans who think and pray about these problem . see any actual solution to them that might bemade within your social system ? any way to attack them fundamentally without changing the structure of your society ? You understand what I mean ? ' ' I nodded , and sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things ? of our private property rights that maintain slums , of the legal dodges of discrimination , of the moral tone of our unassailably free press and TV , of the cost of our unsocialized medicine and drugs . Then I said : " I think not . " " Well , " he said , " that is my impression , too , but one does not know so very much about faraway places . You are the first American I have ever talked to . " He went on : " And now 1 must say something very hard for me to say . Our social structure here has been changed fundamentally , as you know . And all these problems have been attacked with the full force of our society . As insoluble problems they no longer exist . I do n't mean , " and he smiled , " that the Communist party has found out how to eliminate original sin . These things exist , of course , but they have been checked with great success . But ? " He paused , and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I know , " I said . " Let me speak of our children . We see them being taken away from their Christian faith . The pressure on them is great , in the schools , in the press . over the radio , over television now ; in the Pioneers and the after-school recreation programs and summer camps . We see we are losing them , many of them , and , in the end , without Christ ? " He paused again , and went on : " At the same time we see them growing up clean and enthusiastic . Their lives are crowded with constructive activities . They arc wholesome children ? excuse me , I do n't say more wholesome than yours in America ? but more wholesome than we were in Hungary a generation ago . You must understand that as parents and pastors we are very happy about this . But ? in the center of their being ? " I nodded , and he said , in the quiet room : " You see the dilemma , Brother Mayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk mean that the churches have " made peace " with the Communist regimes ? Of course it does . And if this sounds sordid , or even sacrilegious , to us in our free-and-easy situation , in which war with the regime is unthinkable , we may remind ourselves that nearly all great churches have nearly always made peace with all regimes . The question of political liberty is relatively modern in Christian casuistry anyway . Is the cure of souls to exclude the unfree ? Historically the Church has been preoccupied with liberty only when it meant the religious liberty of the preoccupied denomination ; it is hard to lay a finger on the anathematization of tyranny as such . The Catholic excommunication of Communists rests on atheism , not on tyranny . But last August the presiding Lutheran bishop of West Germany delivered an exegesis on Romans 13 : Christians are not subject to godless powers that be . In effect he called upon East European believers to choose between treason and damnation . It is a call which is not likely to be answered " over there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who need not choose to those who must . One day I sat with an American official in a Communist city and listened to him talk to a local pastor . The American wanted to know what the pastor was doing to fight Communism . The pastor replied that he was not fighting anything ? he was preaching the Gospel of Christ . Why did he stay in such a God-forsaken country ? " Well , you see , it is my country , and who knows which country God has forsaken ? " But would n't he rather be free ? " But I am as free as I deserve to be . And besides , I am ordained as a pastor and a pastor is a shepherd . Would a shepherd be a good shepherd if he ran away from his flock ? " If the American official had been a religious man ? he said he was n't ? he might have put the question differently . He might have asked why the churches in Europe fought Fascism so much more whole-heartedly than they fight Communism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an easy one . The Church as such did not fight Fascism , and of those minorities in it that did , Catholicism ( in Protestant Germany ) fought it sooner and better . In 1933 some of the highest heroes of the subsequent Protestant resistance in Germany sent Hitler their formal assurance of " loyal and prayerful support . " They say now that they did not see then , at the beginning , that Fascism was an aberration in human history . But these same men , men like Nimbiler , who discovered that a Christian could not live with Fascism , seem now to be convinced that a Christian can live with Communism . They seem to be convinced that Communism is not aberrant in human history , and that its aberrative elements are not at its center . They may be wrong . It may he theologically shaky to suppose that Communism is compatible with the Christiansocial order , but the Western Church has not yet pronounced Acts 4:34-35 theologically shaky : . . . and distribution was made unto every man according as he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the same thing as the present coercion , why , the coercers have no objection to voluntary Communism . But Leo XIII 's Rerun Novarum cried out for social justice seventy years ago , and wherever social justice came , and in whatever degree it came , it came without much benefit of clergy . The German Confessional Church , in its first synod after Hitler 's fall , took upon itself the blame far his rise : " We erred in overlooking the fact that the economic doctrines of Marxism should have reminded us of our duties toward our flock in regard to their social needs in this world . We have failed to make the cause of the poor and the outcasts the concern of Christians according to the coming Kingdom of God . " That was said in 1946 . " They freeze and starve beneath our heaven-bent feet . " That was 1556 . THE HARE BOLD BISHOP D O E S the State control the Church ? " is a strictly American question . In the rest of the world it has usually controlled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is control ? We Americans are incredulous to hear that in all the Communist countries ? excepting the U.S.S.R. ? religious instruction is given in the public schools at public expense by a pastor of the child 's own faith . But it always was . Until the end of the first world war it was compulsory . Now the State does what little it can ? here is the totalitarian dictatorship doing what little it can ? to discourage it . Written application by both parents is required , so that the father has , in effect , to declare himself a Christian . In two areas , finance and elementary education , the Communist State exercises direct control . No parochial or other private school is permitted as a substitute for public education . ( Sunday school is unaffected , and the denominations still have their seminaries , radically reduced in number . ) Non-church property of the Church is of course socialised ; the Prince Primate Mindszenty of Hungary represents the largest pre-Communist landowner in that land-starved country , the Roman Catholic Church . So the Church ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And since Marxism has a worse opinion of faith than of reason , a pastor is worse paid than a teacher . But churches are repaired and restored , and even improved and enlarged , with financial assistance from the atheist regime . And the pastor is paid and pensioned by the atheist regime . This is nothing new , but the Church as a kind of public property and the pastor as a kind of civil servant are more clearly identified now . Our own churchgoers may assume that as such they have no direct connection with the State ; but our courts have held uniformly that tax exemption is a quid pro quo for special service to the general welfare . So , ton , in pre-Communist , non-Communist , and Communist Europe . In practice , there is , of course , an immense difference between the two worlds . When the State of California required an anti-Communist oath of its 12,000 churches on pain of taxation , 11,988 of them took the oath in spite of the fact that all of the leading national governing bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an anti-capitalist oath of its churches on pain of worse than taxation , it is possible that twelve more out of every 12,000 would take it there than took it here . And the central denominational authorities would not denounce it . ( Nor would there be an independent Supreme Court to strike it down . ) By contrast the Eastern ( and most of the Western ) European denominations are rigidly centralized in authority , despite the long struggle of the liberals to " build on the parish . " The bishops rule the Church and they are appointed ( as they always were ) with government approval ? and sometimes retired under government pressure . An actual Marxist is no more likely to be in Church office there than here . But there , as here , the bishops are loyal citizens ; an American hierarch who gave aid and comfort to the national enemy would not long remain a hierarch ; or a Polish , Czech , or Hungarian . A bold bishop is rare in Communist countries , rarer than here ( in the North ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always was . And boldness takes different forms in different worlds . To invite a non-Communist American to preach from the bishop 's pulpit is probably bold in Budapest , and I 've seen it happen . The Church Temporal , there as here , is not very hold , but it is the one institution to which the totalitarian dictatorship is unable to dictate totally . Unable ? and peculiarly unwilling . Unwilling , because the Nazis tried , first covertly , then openly , to control the Church in Germany ; and the dirtiest word by far in the Communist lexicon is " Nazi . " This generally unobserved fact tends to mollify the Communist government 's relations with the Church and , indeed , with all of its citizens and institutions . By 1921 there was not a single church left in the Soviet Union . Religion had been exterminated , with the League of the Militant Godless as the Party 's spearhead . Today the League is dead and the exterminated Church is alive . Its destruction failed as nothing else the Communists have ever undertaken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party ? whose hope , I suppose , like that of all coexisters , is to coexist the enemy to death . The lesson of the Mother Country is not lost on the daughters : there are too many people in these anciently religious lands whom the Church can reach in a way that the State can not . So there is no hot war against the Church anywhere now . Shrines and cemeteries are undesecrated ( although hoodlumism , including anti-Semitic hoodlumism , can still be found , there as here . by looking for it ) . Whoever wants badly enough to be a Christian is a Christian , and survives . " Who are they ? " I said to the pastor of a crowded congregation on a Sunday morning . " Some , " he said , " come because they have always come . Some because their wives or sweethearts come , but fewer of these now . Some only because ? this is always strange , is n't it ? ? they want their children to come . All these you know in your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Certainly more than half who come in the larger towns now know exactly what they want , and they know the price . There are very few actual opportunists left , except , " with a smile , " among us porkchoppers , as you call us . Nobody can come to church any more because it is a good place to make social or business contacts . Not even a funeral director , much less a dentist or an insurance saleman , and , " with another smile , " not a candidate fur public office , oh , no . " THE DROP AND THE STONE T H E East European churches lost so many members during and after the war that they were bound to grow again in numbers . But the growth persists . And Protestant church attendance is over 20 per cent of the membership in the Communist countries and 5 per cent in Christian Democratic West Germany . More important , the age level in the Eastern churches is falling ? " fast , " the elders of the Prague-Nusle Presbyterian Church told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Religion in the upper schools ? are induced by dialectical curiosity to have a whiff of the old opium . Or maybe man does not live by spiring production figures alone . The heaviest loss in the Catholic-majority countries is sustained by the Catholic Church . Early Communism , like Early Christianity , is addressed to what Adam Smith , in the concisest of all social characterizations , called " the laboring poor , " and the laboring poor in these poor countries are preponderantly Catholic ( Orthodox in Russia . Rumania , and Bulgaria ) . No Communist regime makes a formal distinction among the confessions , but in practice Protestantism has a much easier time than the majority church . The minority churches are natural repositories of political liberalism anyway ? not that Admiralissimo Horthy of Hungary was n't a Calvinist ? and the Protestant addiction to worldly progress is a natural ally of social change . ( The Czech Communists , too , claim Huss . ) And there is one political evil with which Catholicism will make no concordat : political atheism . Protestant East Germany is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one with the West . It is a conquered and occupied country . And it is German ; where common cause has submerged confessional differences elsewhere , even between Lutheran and Reformed , " Teutonic " inflexibility still bedevils the East German Church and its relations with the regime ? and with the Russians behind the regime . There are Russians who believe that the only good German is a German Communist with a Russian soldier on each arm . What Communism says and does about the Church , and how Communists feel about the Church are not necessarily the same thing . We were received , in the company of some pastors , by a Slovak Communist official . " In the 1994 uprising against the Nazis , " he said , " many of our Christian brethren here , " and he motioned around the room , " were with us . We wish they were with us now . " " He said ' brethren , ' " I said to one of the brethren afterward . " Yes , " said the brother , " he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is genuinely sorry about this . Many of the Communist leaders are more tolerant than Lenin would have thought possible . " And the New York Times quotes a Communist party central committee member in Poland as saying , " What kind of party is it when half our members sneak off to church every Sunday ? " In the " tougher " countries it is n't a hall , or a fourth , but theremight be a few who do and a few more who might if only . . . Total defeat in the Soviet Union , tolerance in the ideological ranks , the dread of looking like Nazis ? no wonder Communist control of the Church is restrained . Steady pressure ? the drop that wears away the stone ? is the contemporary substitute . But what say the political geologists when there are millions who believe that the stone in this case is the Rock which will not wear away ? The Party newspapers have titles like , " Do You Want Your Child To Lose His Soul ? " He will lose it , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stone . In backward areas the pressures are more persistent because of what Trotsky called " the anti-collective skull " of the peasantry ; so year after year permission to build a rural church may be delayed ; another drop on the stone . Last summer the drop suddenly fell at shorter intervals in one distinctly unbackward country : more difficulty in obtaining temporary exit permits here ; reduced publication facilities there ( because , of course , of material shortages ) ; an outburst in the Party press somewhere else . Old issues were reopened and Church leaders tied up in interminable negotiations . Was it a pattern ? No one was sure . If it was , did it mean that the Party was turning to the " Church problem " in earnest ? No one was sure . The only thing known for sure is that international tension is immediately reflected in domestic pressure . The situation of the Christian under Communism ( the Marxists would say the " objective situation ' ' ) is of course always subjective . And it is never the same from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even from town to town . We Americans may mesmerize ourselves with the image of the monstrous monolith which moves only to crush . But there seems to be just as much improvisation in the " slave " world as there is in the " free . " I have met some doctrinaire Communists ? but never in the bureaucracy of a Communist country . The pressures ebb and flow . Where it all will end ? to use Wolcott Gibbs ' expression in the right place ? knows God ! THE SURVIVAL OF TOY BALLOONS THE conditions of Christian survival under Communism are not ideal . What is marvelous is that they exist at all . They exist because the Church has proved to be indestructible ? at least by Communism . But the indestructible institution is only tolerated . It has got to prove , not merely that it is harmless but that it is worthy to exist . Its God-given right does not signify among the godless . It has got to purge itself of its history in so far as its history ranges it alongside exploitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . ) But abjuration is not enough . It has got to prove its utility to the new order , and to do so weekdays , not just say so Sundays . This means that so long as the Cold War lasts the Church under Communism must demonstrate its independence of those institutions , sacred and secular , which represent or even accept the Western political position . This is why those seamlessly international organizations whose power centers are in the West have special difficulty ? Roman Catholicism , Judaism , and , for that matter , Rotary and the Red Cross . This is why the adherence of the East European churches to the World Council of Churches ? which was cheering John Foster Dulles a decade ago ? is beset with intricacies . By identifying religion with capitalism , Marxism has driven its two enemies closer together in the West than they were a half-century ago when industrial democracy and the awakening Social Gospel were beginning to drive a wedge between the two . The Church is guilty by association . And the Marxists point to Adenauer Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story ? as the full-blown reality of the association . Bedfellows make strange politics ; the Christian Democratic government of the German Federal Republic is surrounded by Nazis because it works within the system of the Krupps and has to take what it finds there . The Church in Eastern Europe must not be supposed to have chosen its situation . As Communism spread after the war , the historical doctrine of " withdrawal " asserted itself , with great force in Eastern Christendom : the relegation of spiritual life to another world and the surrender of this world 's concerns to the State . But this Erastianism ? which had served the old order so wonderfully well ? was precisely what the new would not tolerate . Like all other institutions , whatever their pretensions , the Church , whatever its , would have to serve the reconstruction of society . ' ' If ye refuse and rebel , " the Lord God Jehovah once told the Church , " ye shall be devoured with the sword . " Now the Ministry of Culture was saying it . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under attack because it maintains that the churches should " study and comment upon issues , whether political , economic , or social , which affect human relations . " The attack is supported by economic  - -  - and in some areas military and racial ? rightists who hold , in the words of J. Howard Pew , former president of the Sun Oil Company , that " the churches should stick to ecclesiastical subjects . " The head of one of the attacking groups , the Circuit Riders , says that " the National Council and its program addresses itself in the main to the grievances and the animal appetites of man . The program goes under the fancy title of ' Social Gospel . ' We are for a minister speaking out on any issues except the promotion of Socialism , Communism , or pro-Communist ac-tivities . " The issue then , here as in Eastern Europe , is not in the least between " fundamentalist " and " modernist " interpretation of Scripture , as is sometimes said . It is between Christians who want the Social Gospel preached and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " the grievances and the animal appetites of man , " willy-nilly bolstered that very small element in the East European churches which maintained that man lives by bread ; not by bread alone , but by bread . After ten years of Communist rule , this element is clearly dominant in East European Christendom . The " quietists " ? they still exist , and no doubt in a numerical majority ? are disappearing from Church office . If the Church in Eastern Europe can demonstrate that it accepts the Christian ? the Communists would call it the Communist ? mission in the social order , there is no insuperable reason to suppose that it will not be allowed to have its Christ , too . Marxism does not oppose toy balloons per se , and second-generation Communism does not have to attack on every front at once . But let the Church make a move on behalf of the old order ? or even hanker to out loud ? and the attack will be on again . There may be Westerners who want to see just this happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A T can a Western Christian do to strengthen the hand of the Church within ? not against ? the Communist society ? Not much . " Only to imagine us and our world ? as it was and as it is ? is all we ask of our Western brethren , " an Orthodox Rumanian said to me . " And if imagination fails them , then they must love us in our common faith and not consign us to outer darkness . " " To the people here we Christians are capitalist stooges " ? I am translating very freely now from a Czech Brethren pastor ? " and to the people in the West we are Communist stooges . And we are stooges . We try to understand what Christ absolutely requires of us in our situation . But beyond that ? well , if you say we are being used , ' we can say Yes to that . We know we were sent here to be used . We know that we are not pure . " I was instantly reminded of an American I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Germans , at cost , after the war . He was n't sure he should , and he took his moral problem to Eva Hermann , the German Quaker heroine . Her only response was , " Oh , to be able to afford an American conscience . " What can . a Western Christian do ? Nothing , if a la Cold War , he requires a political declaration as a condition of religious association . His brethren in the East will not join his anti-Communist crusade or concede that the Christian witness is adequately represented by American foreign policy . Western insistence upon a political bill of health can only mean a complete division of Christendom in the end . Those Western churchmen who view the prospect equably should remember that More and Erasmus wanted reform and found Reformation thrust upon them . The Western Christian may simply cross to the other side of the street . And that , in the main , is what he has done . In 1958 the first Christian Peace Conference was held in Prague . There were four Westerners present , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong delegation from - West Germany and a good scattering from the rest of ' Western Europe ? and two Americans , a young Mennonite and a representative of the American Friends Service Com . mittee .

The fact is that the Communists wo n't let them . If the Eastern churches want to have a conference , they have to have it in the East , where the Communists can control it . " The agenda of last year 's Prague Conference called for a day of world penitence and prayer on the anniversary of Hiroshima . Some of the Western delegates expressed concern lest such a call , coming out of Prague , be badly received in the West and especially in the United States .

' ' CHRISTIANITY WITHOUT CADILLACS B L 0 W the winds hot , blow the winds cold , the rock-bottom irreconcilability of the Communist and Christian faiths remains . Accommodation on the economic order is not impossible ; Bible Communism is older than anti-Bible Communism and no less fanatical , as witness the fate of Ananias and his wife , the first Christians who tried to practice a little capitalism on the side .

Communism 's do-it-yourself , Christianity 's dependence and Communism 's tumescent pride in the unaided power of the featherless biped . Communism , says William Hordern , is hateful to us because it has dragged the skeleton from the closet of Western culture : the Christian peoples worship the works of their hands as whole-heartedly as the Marxists . An eminent American scientist complains that " Two years after the first Sputnik , Western peoples and institutions remain subservient to ancient elements of deflated divine revelation , " The Communists have been deflating divine revelation for forty-two years , but there arc Eastern peoples who still believe in God . Faith paralyzed by faithlessness seems to be galvanized by opposing faith . In Communist Europe the Party militant and triumphant and the Church stripped and humiliated stand face to face . They are alone in the arena . " Everything else " ? it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is finished . " I did not meet a Communist or a Christian who was n't alive to the fact ; earnestly , rather than joyously , alive in that northern world whose hallmark is earnestness anyway . It is a long-term struggle ; both sides see it that way now , even in the U. S. S. R. But one side always saw it that way , and there lies its advantage . The Communists are no less adept atthe arts of attrition than the capitalists . But the battlefield here is crepuscular , and you ca n't get a man with a gun . We shall see if the Profane Reformation can be informed by a Church which has either its faith or nothing . We shall see what Christianity can do without Cadillacs . A Lutheran archbishop in the East ( there are some ) said : " Like Marxism , Christianity believes in the New Man , though we differ as to the manner of his coming to be . Like the Marxist , too , the Christian lives for the future and is willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods . To say , as some of our Western friends say , ' If I had nothing , I 'd live for the Future , too , ' is one way to say it . But another way to say it is that people who live for the future have something to live for . " Before I left Eastern Europe , I asked an elder , and a very old elder , what the Church in the West can contribute to our time . " I do not know the West , " he said , " but I know that there , as here , all Christians sing the hymn , *In Christ There Is No East or West . ' So I shall simply say what I think the Church , West and East , can contribute . if the trouble of the world is too deep and too desperate for self-interested negotiation , then there is something left which neither capitalism nor Communism offers . but only the Church : brotherhood . But the Church must learn before it can teach . "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
