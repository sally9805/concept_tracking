" The president of the University of California takes his final exam every month , " said Clark Kerr to a group of reporters last week . " I 've taken lots of them and passed . This time I did n't . " Indeed not . By a vote of 14 to 8 , Cali fornia 's board of regents had just de cided to dismiss Kerr after eight years as head of the nation 's largest university . <P> Kerr 's firing was not all that much of a surprise ; many of the regents have openly blamed him for failing to pre vent two years of intermittent disorder at the university 's oldest and most prestigious branch at Berkeley .

Kennedy Jr. , a lawyer and one of the ten regents appointed by former Governor Pat Brown .

Among those supporting Kerr were Assembly Speaker Jesse Unruh and Industrialist Norton Simon . <P>
