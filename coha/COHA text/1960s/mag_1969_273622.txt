WHAT lessons have the American people learned from the war in Viet Nam ? In light of that chastening experience , how do Americans appraise the nation 's military commitments around the world ? How willing are Americans to have the U.S. intervene in other , future conflicts ? Pollster Louis Harris and a task force of interviewers surveyed for TIME a representative sample of Americans . Harris ' poll reveals widespread skepticism about the uses of military power-including strong doubt about what the U.S. should do to counter irritating jabs from an increasingly pugnacious North Korea . <P> If North Korea continues to capture U.S. spy ships or shoot down U.S. aircraft , a sizable minority-21%-feel that the U.S. should risk nuclear war with the Soviet Union . On the other hand , 62% think the danger not worth incurring , while 17% are unsure . There is disagreement over how the U.S. should respond directly to renewed North Korean provocation : 21% would send another warning , 21% would favor a naval blockade , 16% would bomb North Korea 's airfields . Only 8% would go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third ( 34% ) are not sure what the U.S. ought to do . <P> <P> A majority of Americans , 82% , still fears that without any U.S. guarantee of their territorial integrity , many smaller nations face the threat of aggression . But when it comes to supporting threatened nations with force , that majority diminishes : only by 46% to 36% do the American people want to extend such guarantees . A majority ( 64% ) maintains that if weaker nations are to be defended at all by the U.S. , it must be in conjunction with America 's principal allies . By nearly 2 to 1 ( 52% to 28% ) , Americans now believe that " we can not go it alone in the world any more . " Many Americans now favor pulling back into an " orbit of protection , " as Harris calls it , which is considerably more restricted than the rhetoric of U.S. foreign policy would suggest . <P>
