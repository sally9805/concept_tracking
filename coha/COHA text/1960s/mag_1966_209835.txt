PRO BASKETBALL <P> For when the One Great Scorer comes to mark against your name , <P> He writes-not that you won or lost - but how you played the Game . <P> - Grantland Rice <P> The sentiments , exactly , of the players in last week 's National Basketball Association All-Star game . To begin with , there was never any question about who would win , because all the big stars-Wilt Chamberlain , Bill Russell , Oscar Robertson-were on one side . The East had already won the game three years in a row , and had no trouble making it four straight , 137-94 . But if the game itself was a bore , the game within the game was fascinating because , for the first time , N.B.A. officials had decided to give something of value to the night 's most valuable player : a $5,000 Ford 7-Litre convertible . <P> <P> Naturally , that put East Coach Red Auerbach in something of a bind . In real life , Red coaches the World Champion Boston Celtics-and three of his Celtics were playing for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bent over backwards to be fair , care fully parceled out equal court time to each of the East players . " There 's only one ball , fellows , " Red sighed unhappily . " You 've got to remember the spot I 'm in . " Auerbach 's Celtic star Bill Rus sell , who drives an $11,500 Mercedes-Benz , did his bit to help his coach by scoring exactly two points in 23 minutes . <P> The happy solution would obviously be for a Cincinnati player to win the car . Oscar Robertson , who already has both a 1965 Cadillac and a 1966 Olds Toronado , was the logical candidate , but he had an unaccountably bad night , scoring just 17 points-14 below his average . With Robertson 's modest defection , there seemed to be no way to keep Philadelphia 's Wilt Chamberlain from winning the Ford-although he needed it less than anybody else , since he owns a $24,000 Bentley-and ca n't get into a Volkswagen . At 7 ft. 2 in. , Chamberlain was just too tall and talented to avoid scoring 21 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East leading 29-12 , he sent in Cincinnati 's Adrian Smith , the last player named to the ten-man East squad . <P> Smith responded by shooting every time he got his hands on the ball . " Say , Smitty , " Chamberlain whispered to him jokingly , " you 're making it awfully tough for me to win that award . " Smith smiled and kept shooting . By game 's end , he had scored 24 points , and everybody heaved a sigh of relief when N.B.A. President Walter Kennedy handed him the keys to the Ford . All Smith had at home was a 1965 Thunderbird .
