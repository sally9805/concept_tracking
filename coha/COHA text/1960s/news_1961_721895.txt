txt NIVa.grier- Runs Again Mayor Wagner will seek a third term at City Hall . His announcement sets at rest long uncertainty compounded of health , family and political considerations . It means that the contest is now Wagner &; Ticket vs . Lefkowitz &; Ticket  --  a contest on which we reserve judgment at this time , pending campaign developments . The Mayor stood firm in insistence on a new running mate for Controller . The dropping of Lawrence E. Gerosa was clearly foreshadowed three months ago when Mr. Wagner described him as " a man of limited ability and less knowledge . " ' this appraisal he could hardly disavow . But it can be applied with equal if not greater aptness to the man Mr. Wagner has accepted to replace him on the ticket , Abe Stark , beneficiary of an incredible turnabout by the Mayor , who as recently as last week-end had every intention of choosing the able Budget Director Abraham D. Beame for that spot . Paul R. Screvane becomes the candidate for President of the City Council , a good choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Board of Estimate and for the reason that it supplies the successor to the Mayor 's seat in event of vacancy . In keeping Mr. Stark on the ticket the " independent " Mayor succumbed ingloriously to political pressure in the final hours . Damned if he did drop Mr. Stark and damned if he did n't , the Mayor simply moved him to a new post , where his inadequacy will be even more complete . The Mayor lacked the courage of his convictions and his retreat will haunt him in its aftermath . The Wagner administration , which made a good record in its first four years , has fallen off in public esteem in the second term , and is even now being damaged further in reputation by a public school scandal on top of previous disclosures of corruption . Nevertheless , there is much that is favorable In Wagner 's eight years . The Mayor 's appointments have been generally good , and some of them excellent . Creation of the office of City Administrator was an nth , and substantial accomplishment . A large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil servant has achieved a new dignity . The importance of the City Planning Commission has been elevated , and the first comprehensive revision of the 1916 Zoning Resolution governing land-use adopted . Streets are cleaner . Park area has been enlarged . The transit system is in some respects improved ; the obsolete subway power plants were sold . The Mayor has taken the initiative in Charter reform . But the unfavorable can not be ignored . It too would make a long list . The Mayor 's lack of courage on taxation has left a train of bitter consequences : too few policemen ; salaries still inadequate in many departments , including education ; over-reliance on borrowing at great cost in debt service . The Mayor 's exertion of leadership is occasional , rather than steady . Procrastination has been one of his vices . The school system , and some other responsibilities of government , have been under-financed and also put or left in inadequate hands . While we have much new housing , slum conditions remain as testimony to the Wagner administration 's inability to master enforcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been done in traffic relief and against illegal curb parking . Political timidity has stalled many an advance in many a field . This is , in great abbreviation , the record on which Mayor Wagner will run again , and a mixed record it is.
