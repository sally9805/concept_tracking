Throughout the long days of the trial , George Broomis had listened at tentively to both sides . An openly emotional man , he tried his best to control himself , but at times found it impossible . " I 'm a sentimental person , " says Broomis , " and every time the tears came to my eyes I tried to stop them . Day after day , sitting there with him sitting in the chair in front of me , it was terrible . I tried not to look at him and I tried not to look at his mother , but they were always there . " <P> For Broomis and the eleven other jurors , the ordeal of Case No. 233421 ended last week . The seven men and five women decreed that Sirhan Bishara Sirhan , killer of Senator Robert F. Kennedy , should be put to death in the gas chamber at San Quentin . <P> The first-degree verdict and the death sentence showed how little impact the defense had had in trying to prove with psychiatric testimony that Sirhan was incapable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , law-and-order approach by the prosecution that convinced the jury . " Sirhan Sir han was entitled to a fair trial , " Prosecuting Attorney John Howard told the jurors in arguing against a life sentence . " He has no special claim to further preservation . " <P> Too Harsh . Having reached the first-degree murder verdict the previous week , the panel , under California law , had to decide on Sirhan 's punishment . The defense and prosecution made brief pleas , after which the jury spent eleven hours and 45 minutes deciding Sirhan 's fate .

" Four formal ballots were taken , but life imprisonment never received more than three votes . Finally , unanimity was achieved . George A. Stitzel , a pressroom foreman for the Los Angeles Times , reported later : " One item that was very important was the idea that we should stand behind our laws . " <P> Benjamin Click , owner of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panel , reasoned that Sirhan was not only anti-Zionist but " fanatically " against anyone who supports Israel . " Bending over backwards to give him more of a break , " Glick voted for life imprisonment on the first ballot . He stayed up all the next night , finally deciding that Sirhan " deserved death for his heinous , dastardly crime . " <P> Defense testimony by two psychiatrists and six psychologists was often obscure , at times conflicting-and never convincing to ' the jury . When the defense pressed its experts for judgments on Sirhan 's sanity , the imprecision of the science became obvious . Each psychologist and psychiatrist seemed to have a slightly different theory about Sirhan 's mental state . " All those psychiatrists-they really had us all stirred up , " said Albert N. Frederico , a plumber . " It was confusing . It stunk . "
