Luv . A miserable New York intellectual hovers on the Manhattan Bridge , preparing to take the plunge . An old college chum happens by , pulls him down and speaks of love-the panacea for all spiritual ills . " I 'm more in love today than on the day I married , " he swears , " but my wife wo n't give me a divorce . " Solution : wife swapping , with the intellectual taking over for the husband and the husband going off to his mistress . But the cure turns out to be worse than the disease . The intellectual 's misery is contagious , and six weeks later everyone is even more wretched than before . In a frenzy , the exes reunite to get the suicide back on the bridge and into the water , where he belonged in the first place . <P> That , more or less , was the plot of Luv , one of the funniest Broadway plays of recent years . Transferred to the screen , the comedy of the absurd comes close to being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a cockeyed but unerringly apt satire of people who make Freud their only poet , whose love talk is all about adjustment , alienation , angst and other pop-psychological cant . But this deft parody has given way to the adolescent vulgarisms of Scriptwriter Elliott Baker , who plots slapstick sequences in a department store and a Japanese restaurant that would be tasteless in a Jerry Lewis movie . <P> Of the three principals , only Elaine May , as the wife , is well cast , but she is pitching in a game with no catchers . Peter Falk is too simian and heavy for the popinjay part of her wayward husband , and as a Jewish urban type , Jack Lemmon is frantic without being at all funny . Luv is too good a comedy to die this way ; people who have never seen it will do better to find a road company of the play .
