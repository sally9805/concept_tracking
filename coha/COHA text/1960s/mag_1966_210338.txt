Television last week tautened its slack season with some of its finest hours , a reprise of Arthur Miller 's Death of a Salesman and a pastoral homily by Lyndon Johnson . <P> Soul &; Heels . When Miller 's drama was first performed in 1949 , the public pronounced it pretty strong stuff . But the jet age and the Great Society have intervened , and the traveling salesman may some day go the way of rent control and the propeller-driven plane . Many viewers who tuned in to CBS 's Xerox special were just curious to see whether the play had gone out of style since its premire . <P> It had n't . Salesman was never meant to be a documentary , and its X-ray examination of a man who is going under has kept it from becoming a period piece . Willy Loman , the salesman whose soul is as worn as his heels from his mindless pursuit of the American dream , is as pathetic today as he was 17 years ago . As his faithlessness to his wife and himself backfires and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Greek drama , and Miller 's point drives itself home : the common man can suffer a king-size tragedy . <P> For the leading roles , the producers cast the two Broadway originals : Lee J. Cobb as Willy and Mildred Dunnock as his wife Linda . They knew their parts by heart-and by body . Since her debut in the part , Dunnock 's hair had turned grey and she had become a grandmother ; the lines on her face were real ; her poignancy and power were all the more effective for her age . Cobb , now 54 , had played the part so memorably ( 330 times ) on Broadway that he and Willy have become nearly indistinguishable . Even on TV 's western series , The Virginian , he seemed to be a peddler in the saddle , itching to dismount and begin pushing his products . <P> Salesman had its flaws . The scenes between the agonized Loman sons-alternately hating and loving the man who had filled them full of ballooning , worthless dreams-were edgy rather than sharp . And television 's code blunted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By God , I was rich " became " By George , I was rich " ) , needlessly sacrificing Miller 's most formidable faculty : language . <P> Despite shortcomings , the program deserved the unreserved raves it gathered from critics all across the country . In the field of television , marked with the molehills of situation comedies and look-alike-sound-alike adventure shows , Salesman loomed as nothing less than Olympian . <P> Texas Gothic . Equally worth seeing was The Hill Country : Lyndon Johnson 's Texas . The President of the U.S. is glimpsed most often in formal circumstances , at press conferences or speechmaking . NBC set the balance straight with a beautifully photographed color documentary that placed the man in the context of his own countryside . The fabulous hills and by now mythical Pedernales River were reduced to their actual proportions , to sere ranch land and meandering stream . Next to them , the President suddenly appeared lifesize , and shucking both his White House mantle and " jes ' folks " delivery , he reminisced about his beginnings with pride , enthusiasm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
