txt ADVERSE WEATHER loners crop prospects , helping shrink Federal farm costs . Hot , dry August days dimmed the production outlook for many key crops . Early frosts in the upper Midwest last week probably ti immed output further . The production value of corn , cotton , soybeans and milk lost since early August is put at $270 million by Federal officials . This is partly offset by gains of about $100 million in other crops , especially wheat , tobacco and barley . Practically all of the net reduction of $170 million should be reflected in smaller pricepropping outlays . The reduced flow into the Federal price shelter is expected to result in a further saving to Uncle Sam of about $50 million in transportation handling , storage and interest The total drop of $220 million would equal about $1 20 for every person in the nation .

In the Middle East and Far East , bulgur is one of the most popular wheat foods . The Government plans to contract for 300 million pounds of this par-boiled , cracked wheat product in the year that started July 1 , nearly four times its purchases in 1961-62 . It will take some 6 million bushels of wheat to make that much bulgur . To help melt the dairy glut , officials plan this fiscal year to have 100 million pounds of their hoard of 350 million pounds of butter made into butter oil . This product , made by removing moisture from butter , does n't require refrigeration . It can be remade into butter . used to enrich milk , or in ice cream . The Government also steps up buying of rolled wheat , peanut butter , shortening and dried milk . ? GASOLINE PRODUCERS shudder as Detroit renews Its horsepower race . Auto makers boost horsepower in many 1963 models , even the compacts . Chevrolet offers an optional 150 H.P. engine on the new Corvair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Motors make similar offers . Result : Car firms recommend regular gasoline for only 65% of the 1963 models , down from 78% on the 1962 's . Recalling 1959 , when they brought out superpremium fuels just as compacts hit the market , oil men fear they have guessed wrong again by their recent gamble on low-octane " sub-regulars . " Refiners figure the higher powered new models will force a half-point boost in octane needs . An increase of this amount would cost the industry $250 million yearly and competition probably would force oil firms to absorb most of this extra expense . There is a ray of sunshine in the horsepower rise . " Bigger engines may lead to higher premium gasoline sales , which are more profitable than regular , " says one refiner . ? ?

COST OF SWEEPING heads higher . Farmers are now harvesting the fourth successive sub-normal broomcorn crop . It 's estimated at 23,100 tons , down 27% from the 1951-60 average . At Lindsay , Okla. , choice broomcorn now brings $475 a ton . about $100 more than a year ago . This boost in broomcorn has already added up to 10 cents a broom to retail prices , producers say . ? LITTLE MINES producing lead and zinc are slow in applying for new Federal subsidies . Only about 30 applications have trickled in since the program began late in July . Companies that have sold not more than 3,000 tons combined of lead and zinc a year in recent years can get subsidies on production on declining quantities from 3,000 tons of metal this year to 600 tons in 1965 . Official figure more than 250 producers are eligible . ? GRASS SEED for fall plantings costs less this year .

In early 1961 , the Government hiked price supports on cotton by about two cents a pound . Result : Prices moved up . In Memphis , the basic one-inch middling grade now brings 33 cents a pound , up from 3014 cents in December 1960 . Synthetic fibers have held even or declined slightly over the same period . Cotton has sustained a competitive loss of 850,000 bales since the end of 1960 , some cot ton experts estimate . That 's equivalent to around 5% of the cotton consumed in the United States over this 20-month period . Synthetics continue to chalk up gains .

To help save cotton , the National Cotton Council favors lower supports , stepped up research and heavier promotion .
