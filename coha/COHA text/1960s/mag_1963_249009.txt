Final selection will be made by such eminences as William DeVane , longtime dean of Yale College , Henry Allen Moe , veteran dispenser of Guggenheim fellowships , and Lord Franks , former British Ambassador to the U.S. , now provost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To recognize those creative persons who are contributing most to the clarification of the individual 's role and his relationship to society .
