When 244 Labor members of Parliament voted secretly last week to name a new Labor Party leader , they did so for the first time in eleven years with some confidence that they might also be picking Britain 's next Prime Minister . The prospect seemed to have influenced the voting considerably . In the first round of electing a successor to the late Hugh Gaitskell , Harold Wilson , 46 , last week won an unexpectedly handsome lead over his two opponents . He got 115 votes ; Gaitskell 's deputy , Acting Leader George Brown , an early favorite , got 88 ; and a third candidate , James Callaghan , who was automatically eliminated , got 41 . Only eight votes short of the outright majority needed for victory on the first ballot , Wilson became an odds-on favorite to defeat Brown in this week 's runoff . <P> In voting for portly , pipe-puffing Wilson , a onetime Oxford don who draws most of his support from the left and was one of Hugh Gaitskell 's archrivals , Labor M.P.s apparently had in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Gaitskell , is a middle-class intellectual . By contrast with earthy George Brown , a plain-spoken lorry driver 's son , many Laborites believe that Harold Wilson will have more appeal for middle-class voters , who have become increasingly disenchanted with Prime Minister Harold Macmillan . An effective president of the Board of Trade for 3 years in the last Labor government , Wilson , at 31 , was the youngest Cabinet minister appointed in 165 years .
