A glittering new star appeared in the heavens last week , one that will be seen by more people than any other man-made object in history . It is the tissue-thin balloon satellite , Echo II , as tall as a 13-story building . <P> At its birth , it was tucked inside a small canister perched atop a Thor-Agena B rocket booster . Launched from California 's Vandenberg Air Force Base , Echo II rocketed into a polar orbit 642 to 816 miles above the earth . As it sped toward Madagascar about an hour after launch , the canister popped open , releasing the sturdy skin of the balloon , composed of two layers of aluminum foil laminated to a sheet of plastic . The warm rays of the sun began to vaporize chemicals inside the satellite , expanding it to its full 135-ft. diameter . <P> Echo II is expected to stay up for three years , will be clearly visible above the horizon at sunset and sunrise . A passive communications satellite that will bounce radio signals off its taut surface , Echo II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By agreement with Moscow , facsimile picture , voice and code signals will be transmitted soon by means of huge antennas at observatories in Russia and England .
