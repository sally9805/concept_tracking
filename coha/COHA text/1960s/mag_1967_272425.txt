Nikita Khrushchev obviously had something to say , but since he fell from power in 1964 he had n't had a chance to say it out loud . On July 11 , NBC will televise an hour-long collection of Khrushchev views and interviews . <P> Two-thirds of the program , entitled Khrushchev in Exile-His Opinions and Revelations , consists of films of the ex-Premier during and prior to his reign . The remaining third is made up of taped interviews and movies-mostly in color - made recently on his seven-acre dacha , Petrovo Dalneye , on the Moskva River , 18 miles west of Moscow . U.S. viewers will see Nikita Sergeevich building small bonfires ( a hobby ) , romping with his grandchildren , playing with his pet Alsatian , munching grapes on the front porch , peering through binoculars over walls that separate him from the rest of the world , dining with his wife Nina . " He looks , " said NBC News Vice President Donald V. Meaney , " like a little old man watching life go by . " <P> Keeping His Trousers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Khrushchev , with the aid of an interpreter , discusses the Cuban crisis . " Perhaps we should n't have done it , but if rockets had n't been installed , would there be a Cuba now ? No , " he answers quickly . " It would have been wiped out and , if that 's true , it means our transportation of rockets was justified . It cost us money , but we did n't lose a single man . What was the American aim ? " he goes on . " They aimed to liquidate socialist Cuba . Our aim was to preserve Cuba , and Cuba still exists . " Recalling the tense hours of the confrontation , Khrushchev said one night he slept fully dressed on his studio sofa . " I did not want to be in the position of one Western minister who , during the Suez crisis , rushed to the telephone without his trousers . " <P> Khrushchev takes credit for preserving world peace by refusing to supply Red China with nuclear armaments , and quotes from a 1959 conversation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mao said , " you have only to provoke the Americans to military action and I will give you as many people as you wish-100 divisions , 200 divisions , 1,000 . " Khrushchev goes on to tell how he explained to Mao that " with contemporary techniques , his divisions meant nothing , because one or two rockets would be enough to turn all the divisions into dust . " Mao disagreed , Khrushchev reports , " obviously regarding me as a coward . " <P> Undisclosed Source . Khrushchev also has words of praise for the late John F. Kennedy : " A real statesman . He completely filled his post . I like the way he - unlike Eisenhower-had his personal opinions on all questions we discussed . Kennedy was entirely different from Eisenhower and had a precisely formulated answer for every question . "
