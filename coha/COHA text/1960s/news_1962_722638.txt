txt Cheerful omen for fall business : Manufacturers are buying more boxes . The boxes ale paperboard shipping containers , long noted as an economic barometer because of their wide use in packaging everything from appliances to zippers . Manufacturers generally order them 30 to 60 days before expected delivery , and seldom stockpile them . So the current box order pace should indicate what production schedules factory bosses intend to set for October and November . For the past month , that order pace has been rapid . A Wall Street Journal survey of box makers across the country indicates orders in August averaged about 7% above the 1961 month , with some gains as high as 13% . And box makers say the comparison is even better than it looks , because last year 's orders were inflated by advance buying to beat a 10% container price increase that took effect Sept. 1 , 1981 . The reports are confirmed by the orders which box makers themselves are placing for their major raw material , containerboard . Paperboard mills booked orders for 769,799 tons of containerboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain over the 1961 period and 20.1% above the like period of recession-struck 1960 , according to the National Paperboard Association . More " Recessions " Needed Orders , indeed , are so strong that several box makers wonder what those economists predicting a recession soon are talking about . " Frankly , all this talk about recession has me completely confused , " says Jerome Stone , executive vice president of Stone Container Corp . of Chicago . " Our business is very strong right now , running about 10% ahead of last year at this time . So if this is a recession , then by all means , let 's have more such recessions . " " Our business certainly does n't reflect the possibility that the economy will go to pot , " seconds Clarence F. Smith , marketing vice president of Inland Container Corp. , Indianapolis . " If the economy does slow down , it will be the first time in my memory that our sales have n't proven a good barometer for business generally . " Inland 's 19 plants are booking orders 12% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makers expect the order pace to hold up , too . Container Corp . of America expects " continued strong demand through September and October , " says Leo H. Schoen/mien. president . And International Paper Co. of New York , which racked up a 9% to 10% August order gain , says it " anticipates a continued increase in volume through the fourth quarter . " A General Gain Better still , box makers say the order gain is geneial among most of their customers . Most firms are hard pbt to come up with any examples of industries not increasing their box orders ; about the only ones mentioned are makers of such capital machinery as cutting tools and manufacturers of certain construction materials . " We had some misgivings about manufacturers of major home appliances earlier this year , " says Inland Container 's Mr. Smith , " but I 'm happy to report they were unfounded . Our incoming orders from appliance producers are running 8% to 12% ahead of a year ago . " An Eastern container firm says it is " particularly encouraged by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automobile parts manufacturers . For the past two Weeks or so , orders from those firms have run close to 10% ahead of last year . That certainly seems to lend support to statements by auto industry officials that they 're looking for good sales of their 1963 models . " Smaller manufacturers are raising orders , too . " For a good indication of what preChristmas business will be like , we watch our toy-manufacturing accounts very closely , " says one Chicago box firm . " And when we see them ordering 8% to 10% more shipping cartons , as they are now , we look forward to the rest of the year with optimism . " The Pocket-Comb Bo vm A New York-based container maker adds : " Ali our customers that manufacture consumer items are ordering heavier than last year . Even one of our smaller accounts , a firm that makes pocket combs , is ordering six times the number of containers it did last year at this time . " Talks with some major users of shipping containers back up these reports . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production schedule and that calls for an increase of roughly 10% , " says an official of Whirlpool Corp . ' s laundry appliance procurement diviMon , speaking of orders for boxes to be deny . erect around mid-September . He adds that " tentative " orders placed for future delivery call , for a continued 10% increase at least until mid-October . An official of Norge division of Borg-Warner Corp . says that concern 's Effingham , Ill. , plant will " be using one-third more shipping cartons , " reflecting a 30% increase in output of automatic dryers there . In Minneapolis , Lillian Royer , who buys containers used by /Kunmingwear , Inc. , to pack lingerie , says she has placed 10% more orders for boxes to be delivered within the next 80 days than she did in the year-ago period . Carton users also say they 're not stockpiling the boxes , either empty or filled with merchandise , " We have a very tight inventory control program , " says a Whirlpool official .
