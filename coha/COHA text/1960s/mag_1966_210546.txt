The Viet Cong were playing the Apaches this time , but Actor John Wayne , 59 , saw very little action as he lumbered around South Viet Nam working on a Defense Department documentary that he is narrating to explain the U.S. commitment in Southeast Asia . The Duke saw plenty of the troopers , though . " I 'm going around the hinterlands to give the boys something to break the monotony , " he monotoned . Big John 's visit was also a change of pace for the Saigon kids who 'd seen some of his horse operas in dubbed versions . They ran after him whooping , " Hey , you ! Numbah One Cowboy ! " <P> India 's greatest fakir , Laxman Sandra Rao , 77 , demonstrated his powers first by taking a walk on hot coals . Then came time for the stunt that the crowd of 1,000 had paid up to $100 apiece to witness : a stroll across the water in a specially constructed tank in Bombay . While movie cameras whirred , Rao stepped off the edge-and sank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd been soaked themselves . Rao retreated to a downtown office building , where he began returning rupees to all the rubes who came forward . <P> As his press release put it , " Mr. Graham is not going to Soho to condemn , but to show his concern for all people . " Indeed , Billy Graham , 47 , aroused considerable concern when he showed up in London 's fleshpotty parish . Swinging through a third week of his crusade in Blighty , the evangelist had planned an hour 's walk through Soho , but a mob of 2,000 zealots swarmed all over him just across the way from the Old Compton Street Cinema ( current attraction : Orgy at Lil 's Place ) . A stripper named Brigitte St. John screamed : " Billy , what do you think of my miniskirt ? " and flung herself onto his car . As the reverend rode out of the bedlam , an aide was murmuring : " We 're lucky to get away with our lives . " <P> Nora Joyce sighed after wading through her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius , but what a dirty mind he has , surely ! " Indeed , James Joyce did have a lot of perdition swimming about in his head , much of which he poured into his great wild tome on Leopold Bloom 's odyssey through Dublin on the day and night of June 16 , 1904 . James and his mind were laid to rest in Zurich 's Fluntern Cemetery in 1941 , the grave distinguished only by a small headstone . For years Manhattan Art Dealer Lee Nordness had thought that the grand man deserved a better monument , so at last he arranged for Sculptor Milton Hebald to do the job . Last week on " Bloomsday , " they unveiled a bronze statue of the author as an old man meditating with his book over the graves of James and Nora Joyce . <P> It was quite a treasure for an art dealer to part with . Still , explained Zurich 's David Koetser , 58 , " I am getting on in age . So I thought I would like to make a gift during my lifetime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Gallery the Allegory of Prudence , a magnificent 30-in. - by- 27- in. canvas by Titian . The gift is valued at $490,000.
