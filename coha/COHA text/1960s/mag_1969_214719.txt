Where Eagles Dare is one of those war movies that looks as if it were cribbed from the funny papers . Steve Canyon is more realistic , and Terry and the Pirates more exotic , but Eagles beats them both in the departments of action-packed implausibility and two-fisted idiocy . <P> Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood appear as the kind of super soldiers who could have won World War II during a weekend pass . Major Burton is head of a British mission behind enemy lines ; Lieut . Eastwood is his Yank second-in-command . Their assignment is to rescue an American general who has got himself imprisoned in a German army fortress high in the Alps . There are two inevitable complications : 1 ) a dirty turncoat is methodically bumping off the members of the mission , and 2 ) one of those guys in uniform turns out to be a girl ( Mary Ure ) . She is a sort of Green Berette , a combination of Mata Hari , Annie Oakley and the Dragon Lady . <P> As time-155 long minutes of it-goes by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past the usual cretinous Nazis , snatch the general and head back down the mountain . Along the way , they slaughter a couple of hundred Germans , blast the Schloss , battle the bad guys to the death on top of a cable car , knock out a bridge and cripple an airport . Not bad for a night 's work . <P> It is a little melancholy to see Richard Burton reduced to playing cardboard parts like this one , but he at least manages to look as if he 's having a good time . Director Brian G. Hutton apparently realizes that pace , not sense , is the essence of such absurd adventures . Whenever the plot mechanics are about to break down , he blithely blows something up .
