WHAT I 'M GOING TO DO , I THINK by L. Woiwode. 309 pages . Farrar , Straus &; G/roux. $5.95 . <P> <P> The man 's talent is even more notable than his name . With only a few New Yorker stories and poems as warmups , L. ( Larry ) Woiwode ( pronounced Why-v/ood-ee ) has staged the best three-way confrontation between a young man , life and the Michigan woods since Hemingway 's Nick Adams stories . If a better first novel than this one appears in 1969 , it will be a remarkable year . <P> At first , the book seems to be an agreeable juvenile confection . The plot is almost conventionally simple and contemporary . A 23-year-old graduate student named Chris marries a 21-year-old coed-dropout named Ellen , with whom he has slept on and off for three years . The tone inclines rakishly toward the comic . Ellen is pregnant , and the marriage has to be a bit of a scramble . There is a mad , drunken bus ride on the part of the groom . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and an introductory sex manual ) from a young minister with a crew cut . <P> But shadows keep falling across the story . Those grandparents of Ellen who purse their lips in disapproval but lend their Michigan lodge for the honeymoon are less comic old folks than vaguely sinister agents provocateurs . Nor is the northwestern shore of Lake Michigan the Garden of Eden it appears to the two children , pretending like every young couple to be the only , the original man and woman on earth . After lyrically celebrating the pleasures of lovemaking , Woiwode begins softly terrorizing paradise . Ghostly presences appear progressively more foreboding : the stuffed animals on the wall , the mice in the piano , night tappings at the window , dead birds , the smell of carrion . Above all , there are intruding memories : her dead parents , his live ones ; the half-forgotten other lovers . <P> Slowly , painfully , they begin to learn about the enemies of love , without and within . Chris loses sleep , then appetite , finally ardor . Convinced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buys a rifle and lugs it everywhere . As the child within her grows , Ellen retreats to her own childhood , resurrecting the toys in the lodge attic . Seeking reassurance , the pair try the ritual of childhood games-Parcheesi , Chinese checkers-then break off even this relationship . Chris teaches Ellen to shoot . At last all they share is the gun , as if the final game were to be a game of kill . More and more , the birth they await seems a kind of impending death . <P> How they survive , and on what terms with love and life , is the heart of the book and the measure of Woiwode 's worldly wisdom . He throws off bit characters-an Indian clerk in the general store , an old farmer down the road - with the sort of spendthrift brilliance that measures an abundant talent . He handles those woods with the care and exactness of a naturalist . In short , at 27 , he is already a novelist one can trust . Past blitheness , but not up to bitterness , Woiwode treats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows the price of love-and he knows the cost of living without it .
