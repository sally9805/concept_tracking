When a dog 's social relationships are uncertain , or its family environment is insecure , or its master fails to live up to the kind of leadership image the dog has in mind , there is fertile ground for the seeds of mental illness to take root . <P> <P> That , at least , is the theory of a few " doctors " around the U.S. who bill themselves as " canine psychologists . " The leading practitioner , a Beverly Hills man named Dare Miller , 40 , has propagated a whole four-dollar Freudian vocabulary to explain what it is that teaches old dogs new tics . <P> According to Miller , who takes it all quite seriously , a dog can be afflicted with an " anxiety syndrome , " a " jealousy syndrome , " the " secretary syndrome , " " dominance frustration , " " barrier frustration , " or even " psychosexual misorientation . " And that 's bad , because dogs burdened with those neuroses tend to destroy bedroom slippers , jump on guests , bite mailmen , wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagging their tails . <P> A dog thus troubled can see Miller for six 50-minute sessions for $245 ( in advance ) . Miller has a B.S. in child psychology from California State College , and a " doctorate of psychology " from a now-defunct Kansas City , Mo. , institution called the College of Philosophy . <P> Under Miller 's patient probing , any number of dread disorders may be identified . The anxiety syndrome and dominance frustration affect a dog who thinks that its master is too unmanly to protect the home ; the animal feels that it must boss the household , and so attacks anybody who comes around . The secretary syndrome arises when the master works late at the office ; the dog becomes tense and irritable because its master is not at home on time . In barrier frustration , the dog gets infuriated because it can not break its lesh . Psychosexual misorientation is something esle . If the pup has been weaned in a " traumatic " way , it ewill indicate maladjustment by " narcissitic behavior " ( overeating and excessive scratching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( biting the postman ) . <P> Sibling Rivalry . Miller 's Canine Behavior Center usually has two dozen dogs under treatment , and Miller has had a number of celebrity cases in his practice . He claims to have cured Kirk Douglas ' apricot poodle of " terribly regressive " characteristics , disposed of the " postman syndrome " in the dogs of Lauren Bacall and Anthony Franciosa , and erased the dominance frustration in Katharine Hepburn 's German shepherd . He did not have much luck with a case of sibling rivalry in Bob Hope 's dogs , but he blames that partly on the Hopes , who did not show up for most of the counseling sessions . But Miller says that he had enormous success with Governor Ronald Reagan 's young collie , turning it from a frisky puppy into a mature dog that the Governor is now " able to communicate with .
