<P> As a lawman , Philadelphia 's District Attorney Arlen Specter was almost to Blackstone born . He has officially been a law enforcement officer since the age of three , when the sheriff of Sedgwick County , Kans. , deputized him during a visit and won young Specter fleeting fame in Ripley 's Believe It or Not . In 1964 , as one of the youngest ( he was then 34 ) investigators with the Warren Commission , Specter developed the report 's cental " single-bullet " theory of the Kennedy assassination . Then , back in Philadelphia , Specter shifted political allegiance from liberal Democrat to liberal Republican , won handily in the 1965 race for district attorney to become the city 's first major G.O.P. victor in a dozen years . Last week Specter took on a new challenge : he accepted the Republican nomination for mayor in this fall 's municipal election . <P> Few Philadelphians doubt that Specter will win . Polls by Psephologist E. John Bucci , who predicted the gubernatorial victories of both William Scranton and Raymond Shafer , peg Specter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Democrats , badly split after five years of lackluster leadership , face a furious primary dogfight . <P> Imagination &; Execution . Democratic Mayor James H. J. Tate , 57 , a courtly Irishman with the instincts of a machine gunner , won in 1963 on the strength of Negro support . His obstinate opposition to neighborhood control of poverty funds turned both Washington and the Negro community against him . It also brought out the fighting instincts of City Controller Alexander Hemphill , 45 , who will oppose Tate in the primary . Says N.A.A.C.P. Leader Cecil B. Moore , himself running for mayor as an independent : " Tate will be retired to the position he 's best qualified for : cesspool attendant . " <P> Specter 's mayoral qualifications are exemplary : as assistant attorney general , he singlehandedly reformed Philadelphia 's corrupt magisterial system and convicted three errant magistrates ( TIME , Oct. 1 , 1965 ) ; as D.A . he initiated a round-the-clock police court to speed justice for minor offenders and won Negro support by padlocking dives in " the jungle " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic Action despite his party switch , Specter also has the wholehearted support of Philadelphia 's Republican Boss William Meehan . <P> Specter wasted no time last week in getting his campaign under way . Tate 's government-by-crony , he said , produces underlings who " take direction by tantrum . " To cope with Philadelphia 's problems of poverty , housing , race relations , retaining and attracting industry , he added , " you need imagination and execution at the top municipal levels . We do n't have that here . " Yet .
