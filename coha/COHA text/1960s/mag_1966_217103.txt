In Italian politics , Deputies who vote against their own party under the cover of a secret ballot are called snipers -i franchi tiratori . Last week , on an innocuous school-aid bill , the snipers struck . Near midnight , in an emptying chamber , they routed the Center-Left coalition government of Premier Aldo Moro by a vote of 250 to 221 . Next day Moro submitted his resignation to President Giuseppe Saragat , who , after conferring with other Italian political leaders , is likely to invite Moro back to start all over again . <P> It may not , however , be quite the same lineup . For though his supporters predictably deny it , all Italy is sure it knows who led the snipers . It was little Amintore ( " Il Motorino " ) Fanfani , who only a month ago resigned as Foreign Minister because of the political indiscretions of his wife ( TIME , Jan. 7 ) . <P> Fanfani wants to come back as Foreign Minister with an even greater say in coalition policy than he had before . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to Moro that a full-fledged government crisis might be in the making if the Premier did not pay more heed to the Fanfani wing of the Christian Democrats . That wing controls about 30 votes - the margin that shot down the government last week .
