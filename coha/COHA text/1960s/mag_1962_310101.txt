One chilly evening last week , while visitors in evening dress strolled the lawns of his 135-acre estate , an old gentleman in tennis shoes sat in his 700-year-old manor house and reminisced . " Once I began to inherit family properties , " he said , " it was really my job to build a better world . And besides , I always had so much sympathy for poor little Mozart . ' ' <P> Moved by his sympathy and a desire " to bring first-rate opera to this country , ' ' John Christie of Sussex founded ( in 1934 ) the only privately owned Opera in England . Since then , Christie 's little , 800-seat <P> Glyndebourne ( rhymes with find horn ) Opera has built a reputation for performances of Mozart and other composers that any opera house in the world might envy . <P> Last week mid-afternoon travelers in London 's Victoria Station recognized the signs of a new season when they saw a crowd in formal dress scurrying to catch the 3:45 for Lewes , Sussex , 54 miles away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glyndebourne rose ten minutes late , at 5:40 . The opera was Debussy 's Pelleas et Melisande , the first French work ever done at Glyndebourne . The dreamily romantic settings , highlighted by ingenious lighting effects , perfectly conveyed the sense of medieval wonder that is an important part of the opera . The cast had been painstakingly and expertly drilled by Conductor Vittorio Gui . In the pit the Royal Philharmonic sounded first-rate-particularly so in a theater whose sharp acoustics are ideally adapted to Debussy 's richly inlaid instrumental patterns . <P> As it has grown in artistry , Glyndebourne has also grown socially . During its three-month season English bluebloods battle for tickets , and by midsummer the Times is running piteous appeals ( " Two Glyndebourne tickets . Any opera . Any price . Any night . " ) Although formal dress is now " recommended " rather than required , the great majority of the audience turns up black-tied and bejeweled . In the 75-minute intermission between acts , the orchestra usually gathers to play croquet by the fading evening light while the audience sets up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wicker picnic baskets . <P> Seeking Perfection . Founder Christie , a onetime Eton science master , became fascinated with opera after inheriting $1,329,000 and 10,000 acres of Sussex-Devonshire real estate and subsequently marrying Singer Audrey Mildmay . From the first , he was frankly " seeking perfection " - and he paid to get it . For the posts of conductor , producer , and general manager , he imported a trio of top talents . <P> Fritz Busch , Carl Ebert and Rudolf Bing ( who left Glyndebourne in 1949 to go to the Met ) . In its search for " perfect opera . " Glyndebourne now allows an unprecedented six weeks of rehearsal for each production , insists that with rare exceptions singers remain in residence at least four weeks-a provision that drives away heavily scheduled prima donnas.
