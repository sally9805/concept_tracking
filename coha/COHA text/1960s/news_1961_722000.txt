txt Excess capacity . A slowing growth rate . Tightening competition . Top executives are using all these phrases today to describe an industry principally known until now for headlong growth and stock-market glamor : The electi onics business . They 're convinced the industry is heading into a transition period , during which many of the small firms that flocked into the business in recent years will find it increasingly difficult to survive . The result , they think , will be a growing concentration of sales among the industry 's larger companies  --  In part through a rash of mergers  --  and a switch in executive-suite emphasis from technological development to the less eye-catching management arts of costcutting and tight administration . In at least one major segment of the industry . transistors , the transition seems to be already under way . So many companies have crowded into the business that capacity is now double the market 's ability to consume , according to some industry leaders . Average prices have ve fallen in the past year , and are now low enough to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some mergers already are taking place . and industry leaders freely predict many more . Raytheon Predicts " Shakeout " " You 're going to see a shakeout in this ( transistor ) field over the next two years . and only the strong , the aggressive and the big will survive , " warns Richard E. Krafve , president of Raytheon Co. , major Waltham , Mass. , maker of transistors and other electronics goods . Similar pressures are operating elsewhere . In military items , which account for the largest portion of electronics sales , top aircraft makers have been entering the field to tighten competition for electronics firms already established in the business . At the same time , the trend to more complex weapons systems is giving major firms , with their big technical staffs , a growing advantage in competing for military orders . As a result , " you still have new starts , new little companies . but they 're getting fem.et and they 're not as successful as a few years ago , " says Crosby Kelly , vice president of Litton Industries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of electronic gear for both military and civilian markets . Even in computers , already a highly concentrated field , some major companies are having trouble keeping to the competitive pace set by giant International Business Machines Corp IBM itself is making money on computers , but such other sizable firms as Radio Corp of America and Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator Co. , because of high investment costs and a later start , say they do n't expect computer sales to turn a profit for another two years or so . Meanwhile , of course . their cornputbr losses cut into profits from other operations . Sperry Rand Corp . ' s Univac division , one of the earliest computer makers , has been losing money recently , but says it hopes to be in the black before the end of 1961 . Sales Still Rising Industry executives emphasize these troubles do n't mean the electronics field as a whole has ceased to grow . Factory sales of electronics goods should hit a record $10.2 billion this year , topping the current record of $9.9 billion Set last year and almost four times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Electronics Industries Association , a trade group in Washington . Computer sales are still growing about 30% a year , according to some executives ; the troubles of IBM 's rivals in that field stem from the extremely heavy costs of development and of building up sales organizations rather than any dearth of volume . In other types of electronics goods , however , the rate of sales gains has slowed markedly . In fact , for the industry as a whole , It has been just about cut in half since 1959 . Between 1950 and 1958 , industry-wide electronics . sales rose an average of about 16% a year . From 1959 through this year , sales gains actual and prospective have been averaging only about 8% a year . And while some other industries might consider that still an enviable pace , it 's creating some problems for electronics firms accustomed to a more rapid expansion . For one thing , electronics men complain , a more gradual pace of sales gains makes development costs a greater burden than in the past . " At this lower growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to absorb and justify the extremely high cost of research and development , and engineering of prototypes , " asserts Henry W. Harding , president of Laboratory For Electronics , Inc. , a Boston supplier of military electronics items . New Challenge to Management In addition , some executives suggest , the industry 's Oast swift growth has made it difficult for some company managements to adjust their thinking to changing business strategies required in the current market . " The industry is heavily populated by relatively young men accustomed to the challenge of expansion , " says Warren B. Hayes , vice president of Thompson Ramo  --  Wooldridge , Inc . " It 's much less fun to crack down , to . succeed by discipline and sometimes ruthless curtailment , as contrasted to the aggressive tactics of the past decade . " Many officials , he adds , have climbed to the top on the strength of technical accomplishments , but " now the need is for people with business imaginations .

Up to this year , transistors and other semiconductors  --  devices which control the flow of electricity  --  had indeed been growl rapidly . Factory sales jumped 35% last year . to a record $525 million . But the growth attracted more companies into the field than it could absorb . H. Thomas Neavitt , director of marketing for Transitron Electronics Corp . Wakefield . Mass . estimates mot e than 150 companies now are making sent ii ? Talus tots although , he says . many ate so small that ' I 'd be hard-pressed to name more than 50 " At the same time , the industry ran into rising competition front imported Japanese transistors Also . says James R vice pr esident of Texas Instruments . Inc. , Government orders for defense items using semiconductors have come in since late 1460 at a " lower and slower rate than was anticipated " ' Pushing the Panic Button " Pr Ice-cutting , pet lisps , was inevitable In such a market . and transistor pi ices had been declining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the price break has been accelerated by what Thompson Ramo 's Mr Haves ter me the tendency of some managements to push the pante button , to try to maintain the sales momentum although mat ket conditions wo n't permit . " Transistor technology " has advanced more rapidly than the business and emotional maturity of some of those in decision-making i ales . " Moses Shapiro , president of General Instrument Corp. , adds bitterly . The price break , at any rate . has been severe . Transistor prices averaged Sl 46 in June , the latest month for which such figures are available , down from $2 63 in June , 1960 , and $3 89 in 1954 , when the industry moved into large-scale production . The price-fighting held dollar sales of transistors to $157.1 million in the first half of this year , a gain of only 2.7% from the 1960 period , although unit sales leaped more than 46% to 88.7 million . In June , transistor dollar volume of $26.1 million actually fell 4.4% below the 1960 month , although unit sales were up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as low as many small companies can afford , and a continuation of the price decline for any substantial permit could prole fatal to them , " says Mr. of Texas Instruments . Ttansistor makers have been adopting various strategies to ride out the storm . some of which might give a preview of tactics that will become necessary in other electronics areas . Philco Corp . has automated Its production lines , and reports the move " enabled us to pare costs sufficiently so that any type of pi icing conflict can be met with not too non 11 pain on our part " Fair child Camera &; instrument Corp has developed the " silicon planar transistor. " a new type which Richard Hodgeon , executive vice president , predicts will replace the conventional " mesa " transistor because , he says , it is " faster and more reliable " Tightening competition underlies most of the mergers that have occurred so far among makers of translators and other semiconductor s. tier/era !

The combination appears to have helped : the merged company 's profits are running slightly ahead of the two companies ' cornhined pre-merger profits in early 1960 Despite the large total number of companies in the business , " about 10 companies account for at least 75% of the semiconductor ? oltime , " says Berkeley Davis , a General Electric Co. vice president . " It 's inevitable , I think , when 10 companies have that much that there will be consolidations You 're already seeing some stet gers , and there will be others . And some will disappear out of the business . " Among the larger makers of semiconductors , cat 's an industry source , are Motorola . Inc . and Hughes Aircr aft Co .. as well as Texas Instruments , GE , Trensitron . Philco , RCA . General Instrument , Thompson Ramo Wooldridge and Farrchild The problems in military electronics are - somewhat differ ent , but competition is tightening in this field , too . Military electronics has steadily been growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 71 ' ; of electronics sales in 1960 against about 33% in 1950 . The remaining portion of electrnnice volume is accounted for by consumer items , such as TV sets ; sales in the latter field have been fairly static in the past few years . The growth of military electronics has resulted largely from the increasing complexity of weapons in the missile age . Electronics gear in missiles , such as the guidance , control and information transmission systems , accounts for as much as 60% to 65% of the missiles ' total dollar value , according to some estimates By contrast , electronics apparatus in some of the manned bombers of World War II and even of the Korean War accounted for only 10% of their cost . This very factor , however , has been attracting the old-line airframe makers into military err , trona s as new and potent COMpeutor s . The air craft makers reason they ca n't get a big enough piece of the missile . just by making the casing , to make the business very profitable , and must move into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of big defense contracts . Martin Co . for instance , now builds the automatic pilot and check-out gear , as well as the anti aloe , or skin , for the Titan missile . The company says that during the past year it has remodeled an old 111111 anie section of the company " into a complete plant for electronics design and manufacture " It adds " Electronics will soon assume full division status in the company . and moves are now in full swing to broaden the market base to gain industrial customer s " as well as military . Other old-line plane companies intensifying their electronics activity include Boeing Co , Lockheed Aircraft Corp . North American Aviation , Inc. , and General Dynamics Corp . The size of these companies , and their long experience in military work , gives them an advantage in competing for major defense contracts . And the growing complexity of modern weapons puts small electronics firms at a disadvantage in military items in other ways , too . " Some of these big defense contracts require systems managers , " explains one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must put the equipment together and operate the system , and that usually requires a fairly large company with considerable technological know-how . You need business managers . project engineers and systems engi/reeve . You also have to know where to find the subcontractors . A major company can do this sort of thing " Electronics firms too small to be systems managers can supply components as subcontractors on large military orders , but this is more risky , and the systems manager gains an extra profit from assembling the system . Laboratory For Electronics , one of the big military contractors , is convinced it must grow through merger , enlarge its engineering staffs and broaden its product mix to reduce its dependence on military work " If an electronics firm does not have many skills and can not acquire them , chances are it will not be around when 1970 or 1975 gets here , " says the company 's pi esident , Mr. Harding Mr Harding s company last March acquired Eastern Industries , Inc , a maker of auto traffic control eystems , and rime plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronic and X-ray equipment If the latter merger goes through , the combined company would have sales of more than $63 million year . about 65% in military items . As recently as the fiscal year ended April 2R , 1960 , 98% of Laboratory For Electronics ' sales were to the military . The Computer Business Though the computer business recently has seen a rush of companies striving to compete with IBM , some executives think the odds in that field , too , at e prohibitively high against many more new entrants . Although only 10 companies could be called " major manufacturers " of computer s , " I doubt if you 'll find that rime getting any bigger . and in all likelihood it will decline , " one industry executive predicts . The costs of computer development effectively lose the field to all but large companies " I 'd estimate that the amount of money it takes to rneke , sell em %ice and earn profit from commercial computers on any kind of major scale would be as much as $100 million , " one executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to rent their machines rather than sell them outright so that the income from the computers comes in in small amounts over a period of years , and not in a lump sum In consequence , it takes a long time to recoup the original investment . IBM still dominates the computer field , with an estimated 75% of total industry enines , which are currently running at about $650 million a year , but the field Is becoming more competitive as other manufacturers make strenuous efforts to catch up Minneapolis-Honeywell has opened six new computer sales offices in the last 12 months , and RCA and Univac dr  --  istion of Sperry Rand both say they hsve strengthened their marketing groups with new personnel Burroughs Corp has been advertising In some large cities for experienced computer salesmen GE , too , looms as a growing factor in the field A number of companies in the computer field , however , have chosen to specialize in certain markets rather than Irving to compete with TBM across the hoard Thompson .
