Ramsey W. Hall , 26 , son of a North Carolina judge , was a topnotch graduate student in English at Nashville 's Vanderbilt University . He was a big man , 6 ft. 2 in. and 220 Ibs. , and as far as anyone knew he was gentle and re strained . One night last January he went berserk : three policemen tried to subdue him . Ever since , Nashville has been up in arms over the fact that in the subsequent fight he was killed by the police . <P> On his last day alive , a day pressured by exams , Hall got a speeding ticket from a traffic cop who recalls him as " very courteous . " He conferred normal ly with an English professor , then walked into a grocery store , phoned a girl in Mississippi he barely knew and asked her to marry him . " I am intoxicated with love , " Hall said . He began crying and laughing ; a policeman was called , and drove him home . Later , Hall spoke wildly to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door between their apartments . Shortly be fore midnight , Mrs. Johnson called the police , and three officers arrived . " I wish you 'd just talk to him , " she said . <P> Deep Concerns . Hall rebuffed the police , demanding to see an arrest war rant . Suddenly he pushed Mrs. Johnson down an outside flight of six steps and started swinging at the cops . All were smaller than he . Together they knocked him down , but Hall fought free . Patrol man Joseph W. Jackson , 28 , clubbed him on the head with his night stick ; the stick broke . Hall grabbed the bro ken stick and slugged Jackson . With that - and before his fellow officers could get back into the struggle - Jackson drew his pistol and fired six times , killing Hall . <P> " I would give anything if this had never happened , " said Jackson , who had never used his gun before . " I exercised what I felt was my best judgment , and I did what I thought I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him , went on TV within hours after Hall 's death and called it " a clear case of justifiable homicide . " <P> Others were not so sure . " We are deeply concerned with why three armed policemen could not handle one unarmed student , " said Baxton Bryant , executive director of the Tennessee Council on Human Relations . More than 1,400 Nashville teachers and students petitioned for a full investigation , and the local U.S. attorney called in the FBI for a study ( still under way ) in case any issue of federal rights arose . <P> Responding to the outcry , Nashville District Attorney Thomas H. Shriver went to work . Hall 's body was exhumed , and an autopsy report indicated that the cop 's bullets had gone through his neck , chest , right arm , right side and back . The Davidson County grand jury , devoting 32 hours to the case , heard testimony from Vanderbilt University Hospital Psychiatrist John Griffith that he and three other psychiatrists had analyzed the patterns of Hall 's behavior and concluded that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall , said Dr. Griffith , was probably the victim of a sudden " psychiatric illness of psychotic proportions " that erupted " less than 24 hours prior to his death .
