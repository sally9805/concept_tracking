Each week during the soccer season , millions of Britons take pen in hand to calculate which games , of some several dozen each Saturday , are most likely to end in ties . The sacred ritual can keep a devotee busy all week with form sheets and result charts , and some are known to resort to the sliderule , the abacus or even tea leaves .

" I felt a bit of a shiver come over me , " said Harrison , after he heard he had won . In London to collect the money , he looked a little dazed : " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt badly this morning on the train . " Would the fortune bring him happiness ? Harrison was pessimistic .
