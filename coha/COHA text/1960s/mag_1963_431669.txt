 | The Coast Guard 's Worst Week Early in March , 1962 , a storm of awesome destructive power slowly built up a head of steam far out in the Atlantic , then struck without warning . Vessels plying the coastal sea lanes were hit by 50-foot waves and hurricane-velocity winds . For the Coast Guard , it was the start of " the worst disaster period ? in scope and duration of rescue operations ? in recent history . " Nowhere was the storm 's power more evident than at the Rescue Coordination Center in Portsmouth , Va. , where a small team of controllers struggled to prevent the sea from engulfing ships and men . In such a contest , it is always the sea that lays down the rules , and she frequently calls the shots . At 7:47 a.m. , Wednesday , March 7 , the clattering of the teletype at the 5th Coast Guard District Rescue Coordina18 POPULAR SCIENCE MARCH 1963 tion Center was the opening whistle . It carried news of the first of four major distress cases . All four would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Cape Fear to the Delaware Breakwater . Coast Guard radio operators at Norfolk had picked up the distress call and passed it on by teletype to RCC : TANKER A. H. DUMONT CALLED AND REPORTED HER POSITION 37.20 NORTH , LONGITUDE 71.20 WEST . SHE HAS DECK CARGO , HEAVY TRAILER AND TWO HUGE GENERATORS , AND TWO HEAVY ANTENNAS , AND IS ON SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT . SHE STATES TRAILER HAS BROKEN LOOSE AND REQUESTS CG UNIT STANDBY IN CASE OF EMERGENCY , AND KEEP SPECIAL GUARD ON 2182 KCS . In the RCC , Lt. ( j.g . ) David Zwerner hastily checked Lloyd 's Register of Shipping . It listed the Dumont as a 215-foot tanker . Then he turned to his charts .  |  | By plotting her reported position , he placed the ship 240 miles east-northeast of Norfolk . The radiomen would guard the 2,182-kilocycle distress frequency , but he 'd have to send a rescue vessel . Zwerner chose the Cherokee , a tough , 205-foot , ocean-going tug , then off the entrance to Chesapeake Bay on searchand-rescue patrol . The Cherokee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fastest vessel afloat . But what she lacks in speed , she makes up in doggedness . She set course for the Dumont , reporting to RCC : PROCEEDING MAX POSSIBLE SPEED . ETA 080430R . WX VERY HEAVY NE SWELLS SEA FROM NNE 25 FEET WIND NNE GUSTING 40 TO 60 MPH BARO 29.74 . ETA is estimated time of arrival , and the Cherokee had given this as 4:30 a.m. on the eighth . SOME 240 miles away , the Dumont was plowing through gigantic seas toward New York . The National Aeronautics and Space Administration had chartered it several weeks before , installed special electronic gear , and sent her to take position south of Bermuda . Her mission : to track rockets from Cape Canaveral . Unfortunately for the Dumont , she started home just as the storm was gathering force . . . and wandered  | into the center of it . When the Cherokee started to her rescue , the Dumont was in plenty of trouble . A large trailer had ripped loose and was lumbering back and forth across the deck . AT 8:00 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this : The Dumont a possible distress ; the rescue tug Cherokee en route to her aid ; weather terrible ; seas mountainous . Overall evaluation : situation better than could be expected . It was not to last . Sixty miles due east of Cape Hatteras the 455-foot-merchantman Chun Lee was wallowing through mountainous waves . Capt . Ru Ling Day ? 34 years in the Chinese merchant marine ? was on the bridge as his ship plowed north . Captain Day had brought the Chun Lee across the Pacific without incident . He had eased her through the Panama Canal , stopped at Houston , skirted Key West , and headed north , putting plenty of salt water between him and Cape Hatteras . Between 9:00 and 10:00 a.m. , Wednesday , the storm hit him . Walls of water came crashing over the Chun Lee 's deck , flooding the steering-engine room . The hydraulic steering-gear motor sputtered to a stop . A wave smashed seamen against the deck . In the engine room , men bounced against the bulkheads like Ping-pong balls . Waves splintered four of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Day wrote out a terse message ? in Chinese . His English-speaking radioman got it out fast : SHIP OUT OF COMMAND . IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE REQUESTED . The sleek , 310-foot cutter Absecon got ready for sea in 90 minutes and raced from Norfolk . The Coast Guard tug Chilula left Morehead City , N.C. The Navy destroyer Strong , already at sea , was diverted . So was the command cruiser Northampton , 88 miles north of the Chun Lee . None of these vessels was near enough to offer quick assistance . But there was another trick in Controller Zwerner 's bag . He picked up the phone and called 80 POPULAR SCIENCE MARCH 1963 the Coast Guard in New York . " I 'll need a surpic ' fast , " Zwerner said . " I 'll hold the line . " Headquarters for Commander , Eastern Area , is responsible for keeping track of merchant ships plying the Atlantic ? the " surface picture " ( surpic ) . All ships are supposed to report position every eight hours . When they do . round markers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When they don't. the markers are moved anyway ? by dead reckoning . Comeastarea reported the SS Whakatane , a 472-foot British freighter , the closest vessel ( by the chart ) to the Chinese ship . Zwerner started writing : TO THE MASTER SS WHAKATANE . YOUR VESSEL CLOSEST KNOWN VESSEL TO CHUN LEE . REQUEST YOU STANDBY FOR POSSIBLE LATER ASSISTANCE . AT 1:00 p.m. , Wednesday , the situation was this : The Dumont still a possible distress ; the Cherokee going to her aid . The Chun Lee out of command ; a small flotilla bucking the seas to reach her . In five hours the situation had worsened , and this was only the beginning . All through the daylight hours of Wednesday , the wind kept rising , and foaming white seas boiled to new heights . In the Fifth District RCC on the Portsmouth waterfront , the teletype kept up a steady flow of messages . Near dusk , hell really broke loose . The first hint of what was in store came from the Cherokee . At 4:00 p.m. she was on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @#  | ? making for the Dumont . Lt. Cmdr. Preston Bannister , her CO , was on the bridge . His ship was fighting a primary swell with waves up to 30 feet , coming from due north . The Cherokee was taking the primary on her port bow . A secondary swell from east-southeast was cross-bucking the primary . Suddenly the secondary climbed to top the primary . A wall of water 50 feet high rose parallel to the Cherokee 's starboard side . Bannister felt it hit " like an A-bomb . " His ship shuddered and skidded sideways . By the time forward motion resumed , damage reports were coming to the bridge . The engine room reported water coming down the skylight onto the main switchboard . If the switchboard grounded out , the ship would be dead in the water . The master of arms reported a foot of water in the crew 's berthing compartment and more water coming through every second . Looking aft , Bannister saw that his number-one lifeboat had been stove in . Several life rafts were floating away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ens . George Gaul , head lowered , inched his way aft . He came back with black news . All lifesaving equipment was gone . And 450 feet of hawser that had been lashed down on the fantail had been washed overboard . " The hawser is wrapped around our propeller , " Gaul reported . " It could seize any minute . " Bannister grabbed for the ship 's telegraph , got through to his engineer . " All possible speed , " he ordered . " Under no circumstances stop or reverse the engines . " The Coast Guard has a motto : " You have to go out , but you do n't have to return . " Bannister was in command of a ship in danger of losing all power in a killer storm . He was responsible for the lives of 74 men ? and his ship was without lifesaving equipment . On the other hand , he could still make headway , and the Dumont could be in worse trouble . It was n't an easy decision . He knew ! . that four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she still was n't reporting herself in immediate danger . With reluctance , he radioed the Fifth District : REQUEST PERMISSION TO RETURN CAPE HENRY TO ATTEMPT CLEAR LINE FROM WHEEL AND EFFECT REPAIRS . CONDITIONS MAKE HEAVING NOT FEASIBLE . THE Cherokee limped off at 5:30 p.m . That left the Dumont uncovered . Solution : Divert the Absecon from the Chun Lee ? the Navy or the Whakatane could aid the Chinese freighter . Within the hour , the Dumont ? up to then only a potential emergency ? started screaming that she was in serious trouble . By then , she was hove to and trying desperately to get her loose deck cargo under control . Suddenly the bells started clanging on the bridge . From deep in the ship came an excited voice . " Captain ! The rudder-post bolts are popping. , , If the rudder became inoperative , the Dumont could capsize within minutes . Captain Hutchinson advised the Coast Guard : TIME OF ARRIVAL OF CHEROKEE TOO LATE . WO N'T LAST UNTIL 0300 . What the worried captain did n't know was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ en route to him with an ETA much later than 3:00 a.m . Thursday . The Dumont could go down before help arrived . AT 5:45 p.m. , Wednesday , the RCC again took stock : The Dumont believed sinking with 13 officers and men  | on board ; the Chun Lee not yet reached ; the Cherokee , semi-invalid . Even the Chesapeake lightship , normally anchored 30 miles off the Virginia Capes , was offstation , blown away by the high winds . Lt. ( j.g . ) Bruce Willis , RCC duty officer , had barely time to digest this when the chief radioman rushed in with more word from the lightship . She had been hit , hard . Warrant Officer Warren Barrett , in the pilot house of the 133-foot lightship , had seen the blow coming . Four other men in the pilot house heard him shout : " Hit the deck ! " A split second later a mountainous sea smashed the pilot house , sending glass flying at shoulder height into the rear bulkhead . The wave 's impact knocked helmsman Robert Patton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Water rushed down into the hold , grounding the electronic navigation . In the pilot house , Barrett found himself sitting in chest-high water . Three feet of water sloshed in the engine room . But the radio was still working . They got through to Portsmouth . " Do you have to abandon ship ? " controller Willis wanted to know . " Do n't know , " Barrett replied . " But need immediate assistance . " W ILLIS quickly checked for the vessel closest to the battered lightship . It turned out to be the last one he would want for such a job ? the Cherokee . But there was no s choice ; crippled or not , the Cherokee had to go to the assistance of the lightship . At Portsmouth , Lt. Richard Wescott was duty officer in charge on the midnight-to-eight shift , Thursday , March 8 . It was a watch to remember . At midnight , Wednesday , the situation was ominous : The Dumont believed sinking ; no assistance at scene . The Chun Lee still in trouble ; no assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extreme danger ; the Cherokee limping to her assistance . Things were comparatively quiet for more than four hours . At 4:38 a.m. distress bells started ringing again , and a cryptic message was thrust into Wescott 's hand : FROM RADIO STATION NORFOLK , 27TH MESSAGE OF DAY ( and the day less than five hours old ! ) . FOLLOWING RECEIVED 500 KCS ( primary distress frequency ) FROM OUZX ( call letters of 390-foot Danish vessel Jytte Skou ) AT 4:15 A.M. : OBSERVED PRESUMED DISTRESS CANDLE LIGHTS COLOR RED OR ORANGE IN APPROX POSITION 33-56N 75-12w ( about 140 miles east of Cape Fear ) . MASTER ouzx . Lt. Wescott glanced at his wall chart and answered the skipper : NO REPORT OF DISTRESS THAT AREA . REQUEST YOU INVESTIGATE AND ADVISE . Within minutes , the Dane reported back . He had sighted a " blacked-out vessel , " but its distance was too great for identification . Wescott wrote out a two-word instruction : ATTEMPT IDENTIFY . THE Jytte Skou complied , cautiously making her way towards the blackedout vessel . It was early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the ships decreased , an eerie feeling of something wrong grew on the men standing watch on the Jytte Skou . When the picture cleared , they saw a sight rivaling the horror of fire at sea . What the Jytte Skou found riding those killer waves was not a blacked-out vessel , but the bow section of a large ship that had been snapped in two . It was the ill-fated tanker , Gem . But the Dane reported : STILL UNABLE TO IDENTIFY VESSEL . IT IS A TANKER . SHIP BROKEN IN TWO . SIX CREW MEN VISIBLE ON BOW . STERN NOT VISIBLE . When Wescott read the message , his mind refused to accept the four astonishing words tucked into the middle of the sentence . With a vessel broken amidships , he had a distress of major  | magnitude on his hands . And what of the men in the stern ? Back to the Jytte Skou went this message : REQUEST YOU STANDBY AND ASSIST AS ABLE . ADVISE WHERE BREAK OCCURRED NUMBER OF PERSONNEL ON BOARD AND IF REMAINING PERSONNEL SAW OTHER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , obviously was not discounting the worst . When a ship breaks apart it is usually the larger section that remains afloat ; the smaller section sinks . The Jytte Skou had found the bow afloat . It followed that the missing stern probably had been the smaller section . The fact that the ship was a tanker made things look even grimmer . Crew quarters on tankers are in the stern . If the stern had sunk , it had probably taken most of the crew . By early morning , Cmdr. Vance K. Randle was taxiing his four-engine search plane to the end of the long runway at Elizabeth City ( N.C. ) Air Station . His mission : find the missing stern of the Gem ? if it was still afloat . The Lockheed Hercules was airborne at 6:45 . At Portsmouth , Wescott faced his status board . A glance showed that he had nothing to send to the scene of the disaster . The Coast Guard had run out of ships . It was now up to the Navy . Three destroyers , the Noa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The destroyers would take some time to get there , but the Jytte Skou was standing by the sinking bow of the tanker , finally identified as the Gem . At least that was how it looked until this message came in : DUE TO CONDITIONS OF JYTTE SKOU IN BALLAST REMAINING ALONGSIDE THE GEM IMPOSSIBLE SHIP MUST PROCEED AGAINST THE HEAVY SEAS AND SWELL AS THE TURNING OF JYTTE SKOU TOO DANGEROUS TO OURSELVES MASTER . AT 7:00 a.m. , Thursday , March 8 , the situation was this : The Dumont was still in trouble ; no aid on scene . The Chun Lee was attempting repairs to her rudder ; no help on scene . The lightship Chesapeake was under her own power ; tug Cherokee standing by . And eight men were riding the Gem 's bow , with the only ship at hand incapable of helping . Finally there was the doubt about the stern . With luck , it might still be floating ? helplessly , position unknown . There was one happy note . The Dumont , which had reported she could n't stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of messages . But by now the outline of the Dumont picture was getting fuzzy . ON the bow of the Gem , Capt . Karl Heinmaa , an Estonian seaman living in Canada , and Second Mate Kjelle Bamberg , a Norwegian who lived in Brooklyn , conferred on what to do . There were six men with them . Their 501-foot , molasses-laden tanker had sailed from the Dominican Republic for New York . For two days heavy seas and high winds had pounded her . The big blow struck at 7:15 p.m. , March 7 . Heinmaa heard a big crash that " sounded like rending of metal . " He dashed outside the pilot house ? just in time to see the stern section fade away into the storm . For a few terrifying minutes , as the @#  | general alarm sounded , the captain watched the rushing sea surge into the gaping hole behind him . Then , miraculously , the rush of water ceased . The bulkheads had held , and Heinmaa knew that the Gem was not going to sink just then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonely hours later , the flares were sighted by the Jytte Skou and , for a feu happy moments , the men on the bow thought that rescue was at hand . But the Dane could n't move in for a rescue . The men aboard the Gem could only wait for the storm to abate . By 10:00 a.m. , Thursday , waiting time was about over . The bow was on the verge of sinking . THEN , over the horizon , quietly and competently cutting through the scud of the sea , came the 20,000-ton passenger ship Victoria of the Incres Lines . Her crew : primarily Italian . Her passengers : 445 vacationers , mostly Americans , returning from a Caribbean cruise . Capt . Roberto Mantero had gone to his cabin briefly when the telephone rang . The radioman had intercepted traffic between the Jytte Skou and the Coast Guard about the plight of the Gem . Mantero was back on the bridge fast , checking the position o1 the wrecked tanker against that of his vessel . They were only 12 miles apart ! Seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Victoria arrived on the scene , the passengers and a good portion of her 300-man crew stared , awed and dismayed , at the jagged hunk of metal that was once a ship . Slowly Captain Mantero maneuvered the Victoria to within 1,000 feet of the Gem . Then , from both sides of the liner 's clean hull , black diesel oil flowed into the sea . Two tons of it poured out before the waves calmed enough for Mantero to order the pumps stopped . The job was now in the hands of Second Officer Paola Carcavallo and a picked crew of 12 . Somehow a motor-lifeboat was launched . Somehow it escaped being crushed against the hull . On the bridge , 50 feet above the sea , Captain Mantero watched the lifeboat disappear from view in giant troughs . The eight men aboard the Gem also watched . Rescue was at hand , and Second @#  | Officer Bamberg set about launching one of the tanker 's lifeboats , so that the transfer to the motor launch could be made without delay . One minute Bamberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he disappeared from sight . By some miscalculation or accident , Bamberg had slipped between lifeboat and hull and been crushed to death . W HEN the Victoria 's lifeboat finally reached the Gem , they saw his lifeless body in the water , floating face downward , his clothing snagged on jagged metal where the vessel had snapped apart . As they looked , held off by the running sea , a particularly strong swell swirled up ; Bamberg was gone . The rescue crew turned their attention to the seven men remaining on the Gem . The survivors could not lower the Gem 's lifeboats . Rope ladders were out , too , since the launch could n't approach close enough to the hull . There was only one way ? the seven would have to jump for it . Three times the lifeboat circled the wreck . One by one , the men jumped into the sea , grabbing lines thrown to them , and were hauled aboard . Last to jump was the Gem 's skipper . Then came the return trip to the Victoria , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boatswain inched his small craft as close to the big ship as possible . When both were rolling favorably , he pushed the bobbing launch to the Victoria 's side . Davit hooks were engaged , and the boat rose from the water . On the bridge , the quartermaster made the log entries : " Lifeboat lowered 1145 . Lifeboat back aboard 1220 . Seven men rescued . " Total time : 35 minutes . WHILE the rescue was taking place , Commander Randle in his search plane radioed he had found the Gem 's stern . Randle skimmed her masts . The survivors were bunched together near the deckhouse . A sign had been painted in large white letters on the deck : " 27 MEN , SOS GEM . " In his excitement , whoever wrote the sign had miscounted . There were 26 . Sighting of the Gem 's stern gave the RCC controllers hope of getting through the storm without major loss of life , News of the sighting was broadcast to all ships  | at sea ; the race to save the 26 men began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skipper , Cmdr. Jack Bailey ? got there at 1:00 p.m . By then , conditions had improved appreciably . The wind had lowered to 35 knots ; seas were 15 to 25 feet . Not cruise weather , but bearable . Bailey brought the destroyer to within 150 feet of the Gem 's stern , close enough for Chief Gunner 's Mate Charles Pike to get a line to the casualty . The Gem survivors had only to pull . Slowly the diameter of the line was inreased until it could bear the strain of one , f the Stribling 's 15-man life rafts . Rope 1adders were lowered , and eight Gem crew members made the return trip on the raft . The rest came across in two more trips , in one of the Gem 's own boats . Before bunking down , Willeh Armans , the Gem 's first pumpman , called the night on the floating coffin " the longest night of my life . " BY 5:00 p.m. , Thursday ? 33 hours after the Dumont was first heard from ? her situation had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Coast Guard plane , 90 miles from her reported position . She was making excellent progress . The Chun Lee had been reached by the SS Whakatane and the cruiser Northampton . The lightship Chesapeake was reporting some progress in moderating seas . The Cherokee 's giant screw was still turning . From then on until the storm blew itself out , it was strictly a mop-up operation . The Dumont made it past the Delaware Breakwater . The Chun Lee anchored in Hampton Roads . The Chesapeake limped into Old Dominion Shipyard , Va . The Victoria landed seven survivors in New York ; the Stribling , 26 more in Mayport , Fla . The Cherokee reached quiet water for repairs , then went back on patrol . Four large ships , the lives of 106 seamen , had been in danger . Three of the ships and 105 men had come through . According to probability tables , the death toll should have been worse . How had a greater tragedy been averted ? " All the cases were potential disasters , " Controller Wescott conceded . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and naval ships was excellent . " Then there was the sea , " he continued . You never can tell about the sea . "
