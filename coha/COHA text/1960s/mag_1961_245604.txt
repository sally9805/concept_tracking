Inside are maps and pictures of Charleston Harbor and a side view of Star of the West , the side-wheel steamship that was standing up the Charleston channel on Jan. 9 , 1861 when it became the first target of the Civil War . A story on page 2 lists the principal Southern forts ; on the back cover , Ballou Brothers , a New York concern , offers French yoke shirts at $12 a dozen .

If the resurrection outlasts the Civil War period ( the weekly died in 1916 ) , readers will also see some of the best work of Cartoonist Thomas Nast , whose Tammany tiger and Republican elephant put in early appearances in the magazine . <P> Since the subscription list has passed 2,500 and is still growing , Archie hopes to keep Harper 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has plans to revive a second 19th century journal : Frank Leslie 's Illustrated Newspaper , which flourished from 1855 to 1891.
