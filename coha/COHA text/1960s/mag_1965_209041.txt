Here come the Jane Bonds . Any student of movie mentality could have predicted the reasoning . There was James , devastatingly male , totally urbane , and knocking enemies and audiences dead . So why not his girl counterpart , devastatingly female , totally urbane , etc . <P> There are three conspicuous ones , and an uncounted number of minor imitations . Most unlikely is Italy 's Monica Vitti , an intellectual type seen as a brooding nymph in The Red Desert . In a new British production , Vitti is Modesty Blaise of London comic-strip fame . Modesty has retired at 26 from the international smuggling racket to become a sort of freelance girl Friday for the British Secret Service . Armed with blouse-button bombs , cigarette lighters that turn out to be miniature flame throwers , and lipstick that untelescopes into a deadly arrow , Modesty outbombs and outshoots everybody , including that archcriminal Dirk Bogarde . <P> Twin Pistols . After being She in MGM 's 106-minute movie that seems like 2,000 years , Dr. No 's bikini girl , Ursula Andress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualified for her own license to kill in a wacky movie called The Tenth Victim . It opens in a weird , cubistic New York nightclub , where Ursula is bumping , grinding and stripping down to her glittering silver and green bikini . A Chinese brandishing a .45 automatic rushes at her , but Ursula is the fastest bra in town . Bang-bang , she has fired her twin pistols , whose small round muzzles protrude from her brassiere like iron nipples . As the Chinese slumps , Ursula coolly bends her head to blow the smoke away . Then off she goes in hot pursuit across New York , around Rome 's Colosseum and Ostia beach to get her tenth victim , none other than Marcello Mastroianni . <P> <P> A third European Jane is Italy 's Rossana Podesta , who appears in The Seven Golden Men as a member of an international gang of bank robbers . In a Goldfingerish effort to rob the vaults of Geneva 's Union de Banques Suisses , she is a glowing decoy , dressed in a luminescent lace leotard and equipped with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sapphire clip that turns out to be a two-way radio . <P> Mixed-Up Hormones . Hollywood 's Jane Bond entry is Israeli Actress Gila Golan in Our Man Flint . She is the chief operative of a sinister , SMERSH-type organization named Galaxy , which is bent on ruling the world . Gila is not hipped on personal combat , prefers to smear up the opposition with time bombs hidden in cold-cream jars . The most nonviolent Jane is Diane Cilento , the real-life Mrs. James Bond-or Mrs. Sean Connery to the literal-minded . In Once <P> Upon a Tractor , a TV special promoting the U.N. , she jumps on the Bond-wagon with a chase across several mythical countries , disguising herself as a soldier with brown wig and handlebar mustache , leaping off a pier into the Tiber River-all to elude villains long enough to plead a cause before the U.N . The real James Bond would have had no use for any one of them . He liked his girls dependent . As he observed in Goldfinger , women of the Jane Bond type are simply " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hormones have got mixed up . "
