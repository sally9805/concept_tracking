Responding to pleas from commercial banks , the Federal Reserve Board and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . last week authorized their 13,100 member banks to increase their interest rate from 3% to 4% on savings and time deposits left for at least a year . The step was chiefly intended to help the commercial banks compete more successfully with mutual savings banks , whose rates run as high as 3%. and with savings and loan associations , whose rates run up to 4% . A secondary purpose : to help the banks hold foreign deposits that might otherwise flee to higher interest havens abroad , thereby increasing the outflow of gold from the U.S.
