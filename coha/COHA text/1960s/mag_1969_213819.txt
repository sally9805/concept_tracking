Professor Henry Kissinger , President Nixon 's assistant for national-security affairs , has an improbable passion , which he perhaps picked up from his boss : professional football . Kissinger analyzes the play as if it were a parable of war and peace . Watching a Miami Dolphins-Oakland Raiders game with White House Aide William Safire , Kissinger second-guessed the signals accurately until the middle of the second quarter , when Miami had the ball . " What now ? " asked Safire . Kissinger observed that Miami Quarterback Bob Griese had not yet passed on first down , and might try it this time to catch Oakland off balance . Sure enough , Griese passed on first down-and was intercepted for an Oakland touchdown . " There is a lesson in this , " Kissinger smiled . " You should be careful how you listen to experts on the sidelines . "
