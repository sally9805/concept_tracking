ROMAN CATHOLICS <P> In imitation of Columbus ' first act when he landed in the New World , the frail figure in the scarlet cloak fell to his knees at the foot of the airplane ramp and kissed the concrete . With that dramatic gesture , Paul VI last week became the first Pope to set foot in South America , the only predominantly Roman Catholic continent . The Pope 's journey was not an entirely joyous one . Though he received a warm and at times tumultuous welcome , the cause of his trip was a crisis . His central purpose was to try to prevent a disastrous worsening of the division in the Latin American church-a schism between entrenched reactionaries and radical clerics advocating social and political revolution . <P> <P> By his trip to Latin America , cabled TIME Correspondent John Shaw , who traveled with the Pope , Paul is trying to devise for the continent 's clergy and faithful " a middle way to social progress with justice . " He thus hopes to satisfy the radicals without totally alienating the large number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Seeking evolution , fearing revolution , warning against violence but agreeing that reform is needed urgently , the Vatican is seeking to influence Latin American governments , awaken the conscience of the rich , involve the wealthy nations , and arouse its Latin hierarchy . But all without the church itself risking the loss of its privileges . " <P> Oddly Anachronistic . Thus , in his three-day visit , the Pope tried to identify Catholicism more effectively with reform and with various efforts to ease the social ills of a poverty-ridden continent . Whatever his success , the Pope was clearly moved by the opportunity . Speaking in accented but accurate Spanish to a crowd of peasants outside Bogota , he cried : " Greetings , greetings to you , campesinos of Colombia . And greetings to the workers of the land in Latin America . Greetings , greetings in the name of Jesus Christ , Our Lord , Our Savior . We confide to you that this meeting with you is one of of the dearest and most meaningful moments of this journey of ours . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our apostolic and pontifical ministry . " * <P> Still , the occasion for the Pope 's visit - the 39th International Eucharistic Congress-was oddly anachronistic in a day when a large and militant part of the Roman Catholic Church is turning away from pomp and tradition . The Eucharistic Congress , conceived in the late 19th century by a devout French grande dame , Marie Marthe Tamisier , is a liturgical spectacular that reaffirms the otherworldly glories of the faith . The event particularly venerates the Eucharist , the ritual in which , according to traditional Catholic doctrine , bread and wine are transubstantiated into the body and blood of Christ . With its emphasis on ceremony and doctrine , the congress could have little bearing on the problems of poverty and social callousness that plague Latin America . Pope Paul selected Colombia , Latin America 's most unshakably Catholic country , as the site for this year 's event , frankly calling the honor " a prize for Colombia 's illustrious services to the Catholic cause .
