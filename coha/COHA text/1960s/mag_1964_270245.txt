As both a licensed physician and a lawyer , Florida 's Lawrence V. Hastings was uniquely qualified to participate in the growing controversy over whether cigarettes cause cancer , and if so , whether the companies that make them are liable for the damage they cause . Dr. Hastings has not failed his calling . <P> Unexpected Evidence . Ever since 1957 , after Miami Contractor Edwin M. Green learned that he had lung cancer , Dr. Hastings has been in court suing the American Tobacco Co. for $1,500,000 in damages , charging that its Lucky Strike cigarettes , which Green smoked at the rate of as many as three packs a day for 32 years , caused the contractor 's illness . While the first trial was in progress , Green provided some unexpected evidence by dying of the disease . <P> Hastings won a verdict that cigarettes did indeed cause Green 's death , but the jury refused to award any damages to Green 's wife and son . Since the knowledge of tobacco 's dangers was not established until the mid-1950s , the jury agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of Green 's smoking years that cigarettes can cause cancer . Later , after the Florida Supreme Court ruled that Florida law subjects any product sold for public consumption to an " implied warranty " that it is not harmful , the Federal Court of Appeals ordered a retrial of the Green case . <P> Question of Numbers . When the retrial opened in Miami Federal District Court last month , Dr. Hastings had hopes of winning the first damage verdict in the history of the tobacco-cancer controversy . His hopes began to fade when Judge Emett C. Choate started his charge to the jury . Implied warranty , explained the judge , only meant that the product must be " reasonably fit and safe for the ordinary purpose for which it was sold . " The issue , he continued , was not whether Green died of cigarette-induced cancer ; another jury had decided that . This jury was simply to determine whether " a large segment , a responsible segment , a significant number " of smokers were endangered . <P> Under that definition , the tobacco company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Complained Dr. Hastings : " If a candy company sold one poisoned lollipop that caused one death , it would not be necessary to show that its lollipops had killed off a sizable segment of the population . " <P> Last week the doctor-lawyer asked for a new trial on the grounds that " the verdict was contrary to the evidence . " As lawyer , he faced the problem that the jury was assessing the danger not of one unusual lollipop , but the possible danger of countless ordinary cigarettes to a " significant number " of people ; as doctor , he must have realized that for all the convincing statistics pointing to a relationship between smoking and lung cancer , the tobacco companies can still point to millions of people who smoke and do not contract the disease .
