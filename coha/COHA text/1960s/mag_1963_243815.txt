St. Paul has always been thought to be one man who did not put off writing letters ; 14 of the New Testament 's 21 Epistles are attributed to him . Now a canny Scots minister from the town of Culross claims to have scientific evidence that Paul wrote only four of the letters that bear his name-Romans , I and II Corinthians , and Galatians . <P> The Rev. Andrew Morton , who will publish his findings next month in a volume of New Testament studies , got his evidence from an electronic computer operated by the University of London . Until now , Morton argues , scholars could only question Paul 's authorship on the basis of their personal , subjective analysis of the literary style of the Epistles , and " evidence " that convinced one scholar often left another unimpressed .

Morton 's conclusion : " There are four Epistles which were written by a man whose vocabulary had a constant proportion of kais in it , who used his kais in a consistent pattern and who , by definition , must be the Apostle Paul . The other ten Epistles exhibit diverse characteristics and must have come from at least three other hands .
