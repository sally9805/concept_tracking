THOSE odd-shaped objects in the background of this week 's TIME cover are viruses-magnified more than 50,000 times and reproduced in their actual shape by machine and man . The viruses , which are measured in millionths of an inch , were first photographed by an electron microscope that produces an enlarged image of minute particles through the use of a beam of electrons . Working from electron-micrograph prints , Artist Bernard Safran enlarged the viruses somewhat more to obtain the proper effect for the cover . Among those he chose to use , the sticklike viruses at upper left are the tobacco mosaic virus , which figured importantly in early virological discoveries made in the 19th century ; the smaller , pellet-shaped viruses at the upper right are polio ; the four at the lower right are influenza . <P> IN painting this and other covers for TIME ( this is his 26th ) , Painter Safran did some laboratory work of his own . Borrowing a technique from the old masters ( the general idea is described in The Secret Formulas and Techniques of the Masters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medium . He whips up a potion of raw linseed oil , litharge ( lead monoxide ) and natural sun-bleached beeswax , and cooks it over a slow fire for two hours , stirring often and being careful that it does not boil . He then stores the product , which is called black oil and looks like axle grease , in old mayonnaise jars . When he is ready to paint , he mixes each pigment he is using with black oil on the palette . Then in a palette cup he stirs up another mixture of ( one teaspoon each ) mastic varnish and black oil , and a few drops of stand oil and Venice turpentine . At work , he dips his brush first into the mixture in the palette cup and then into the mixture on the palette . Why all this trouble ? Safran finds this medium more versatile and easier to work with - and most important , " it makes the painting richer , more alive . " <P> While Safran was stirring his paint and laboring over his canvas , Associate Editor Gilbert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIME correspondents around the U.S. , were visiting laboratories and quizzing virologists to put together the cover story . Touring a virus and vaccine laboratory , Medicine Writer Cant donated five milliliters of blood for testing , later found that he was low on polio antibody , was persuaded to take a swig of oral polio vaccine . After Writer Cant and Senior Editor William Forbis had put the final touches on the cover story about Virologist John Enders* and medicine 's battle against viruses , they reported feeling some new symptoms-probably attributable to their added knowledge , but nothing that could not be overcome by a restful weekend . <P> * This is John Enders ' second appearance this year on TIME 'S cover . The first : on the issue of Jan. 2 , when he was one of 15 Men of the Year , representing U.S. scientists .
