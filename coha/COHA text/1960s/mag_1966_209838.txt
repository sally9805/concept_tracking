Having done nothing to help end the New York City transit strike , President Johnson was on doubtful ground when he denounced the settlement as a violation of the Government 's supposedly voluntary wage-price guidelines . Even more questionable was Labor Secretary Willard Wirtz 's after-the-settlement attempt to blame beleaguered Republican Mayor John Lindsay for the guideline violation . The N.Y . Times described the remarks of Democrats Johnson and Wirtz as " blatantly political " - which of course they were . Yet even such editorial cavils served only to obscure some more basic questions-relating to the rather remarkable history of the guidelines and their validity , past and present . <P> The Formula . In 1961 President Kennedy , fretting about the possibility of inflation in a rapidly expanding U.S. economy , ordered his Council of Economic Advisers , then chaired by Walter Heller , to come up with some sort of anti-inflationary formula . They tied wage and price increases to productivity . Recalls a member of Kennedy 's council : " One of our main purposes was to show how both wages and prices are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be brought to bear when either a company or a union disregarded the relationship . " The formula was based on the idea that no union should make contract demands amounting to a wage increase of more than 3.2% a year , and that no industry should raise prices by more than 3.2% in any given year . The 3.2% figure was arrived at by averaging out a five-year productivity growth rate . <P> As it happened , Kennedy himself found the guidelines little more than a handy thing to mention in State of the Union speeches . The guidelines had hardly anything to do with his successful though costly battle to make U.S. Steel roll back an announced $6-per-ton across-the-board price hike in 1962 . On that memorable occasion , Kennedy simply felt that he had been double-crossed by U.S. Steel Chairman Roger Blough , and he lost his Irish temper . <P> After the Deed . Lyndon Johnson , on the other hand , has apparently come to consider the guidelines as gospel . Even though he always goes out of his way to note that observance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though anyone breaking through the guidelines is somehow defying the law of the land . Within the past year he has invoked the guidelines to enforce price rollbacks or holdbacks not only on steel , autos , aluminum , copper , and wheat and corn products-but also on such lesser items as mechanical pencils and catchers ' mitts . During that same period , the President and his aides have employed the guideline concept to restrain wage increases for workers in the steel and maritime industries-as well as for federal employees . Thus the President has lived up to the warning-or threat - made by Treasury Secretary Henry Fowler , who , in a recent speech to the National Association of Manufacturers , said that it was " imperative " that both industry and labor follow the guidelines .
