In his own version of the twelve days of Christmas , Eugene McCarthy racked up one campaign manager , two college triumphs , three promising states , four yeasty issues , five announced primaries , at least six supporting groups , and visions of a dove in a pear tree . <P> As his manager the Minnesota Senator named onetime CBS Executive Blair Clark , 50 , who once served as public relations chief for Averell Harriman . In New Hampshire , where he made two speeches and checked his primary prospects , McCarthy was heartened by a poll of 21,000 students , faculty and staff members of 19 Northeast universities , which showed 75% " would not express confidence " in the way L.B.J. runs the war . Atop that , 1,271 Cornell signers sent McCarthy a telegram of good cheer . Of the five state primaries he has promised to enter , he was credited with solid strength in three : California , Oregon and Wisconsin . He has also announced that he will run in Massachusetts and Nebraska . <P> When Hubert Humphrey called him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard on housing , unemployment and civil rights , linking these three issues into a plea to integrate the suburbs and get Negroes into the U.S. mainstream . Discussing Viet Nam , he reiterated his opposition to bombing north of the DMZ , but saw " no quick or easy steps " for settling the war . McCarthy rejected the notion of a precipitous pullout , observing that the U.S. should draw back to a somewhat vague point " where you can expect the South Viet Nam government to assume major responsibility . " <P> While his contest with Lyndon Johnson brought him the support of a variety of dissident elements , including the Nobel-laden " Scientists and Engineers for McCarthy " - many of whose members populated " Scientists and Engineers for Johnson and Humphrey " in 1964-scholarly Gene McCarthy last week got a taste of life beyond the fringe and found it disturbing . At a University of New Hampshire symposium , when Black Power Advocate William L. Strickland purred ugly platitudes labeling the U.S. " fundamentally a racist nation , " the usually imperturbable Senator snapped : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one problem he faces will be to shake off the extremist groups that will try to exploit him as they did Henry Wallace 20 years ago . <P> The Administration takes McCarthy 's challenge seriously enough to plan a full-scale campaign of Johnsonian electors and stand-in candidates in New England . And , in fact , now that McCarthy is in the lists , he may actually benefit L.B.J. by turning unfocused discontent into a contest between visible opponents , solidifying strength behind the President .
