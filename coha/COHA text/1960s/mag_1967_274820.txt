TELEVISION Ever since its birth in 1952 , U.S. educational television has been lost somewhere between the Vast Wasteland and the Promised Land-chronically short of operating capital and always uncertain where the next grant was coming from . Concerned by ETV 's continuing plight , the Carnegie Foundation in 1965 asked M.I.T. Corporation Chairman James R. Killian Jr . to head a commission charged with finding a solution. - Working with a $500,000 budget , committees and subcommittees made their recommendations , and commission members spent 28 days together agreeing on a report . Last week the foundation published Public Television : A Program for Action . Its gloomy conclusions : ETV has only half the resources necessary to meet its present goals , and the goals themselves fall far short of the needs of the nation . The Carnegie solution : " not small adjustments or patchwork changes but a new and fundamental institution in American culture . " Key recommendations : &gt; The number of educational channels should be tripled to 380 , thereby increasing their potential audience from less than two-thirds to 93% of U.S. homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for simultaneous broadcasting . <P> - New York 's National Educational Television ( NET ) , the present packager and distributor of ETV programming , should be taken over by a nongovernmental " Corporation for Public Television . " The new corporation would add at least one other production center and double programming output to ten hours a week . <P> Such improvements would not be cheap . They would , in fact , triple the present public and private investment in ETV to an annual $ 178 million average in the first four years . To collect that kind of cash Carnegie projections look for $54 million a year from state and local governments , and private philanthropists ( including the Ford Foundation , which has granted ETV a life-saving $120 million since 1952 ) . The report also suggests a 2%-5% excise tax on TV sets , which could bring up to $100 million a year directly to the proposed Corporation for <P> Public Television . Finally , the commission counts on cajoling an additional $68 million-a-year dole from the Department of Health , Education and Welfare . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson were prepublication boosters of the commission study , last week 's budget message requested only a $20 million appropriation for ETV . As for the excise tax , neither the Administration nor congressional committees concerned would commit themselves , and such lobby groups as the Electronics Industries Association and the National Association of Broadcasters can hardly be expected to approve it . The commission , on the other hand , argues that the excise tax would amount to an automatic annual subsidy from federal funds without any direct governmental control of ETV 's day-to-day operations . <P> The unescapable fact is , however , that centralization is far less of a threat to ETV than starvation . Just last week , Cincinnati 's WCET , the U.S. 's oldest licensed educational station , was hours away from bankruptcy when it was bailed out by a Ford grant . Fred Friendly , the foundation 's TV consultant and an endorser of the Carnegie plan , says : " I 'm not as worried about Big Brother as I am about Poor Brother . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
