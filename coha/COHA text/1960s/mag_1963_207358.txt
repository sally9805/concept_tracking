Since 1958 , when the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament staged the first Aldermaston March , its 52-mile Easter parade has turned into Britain 's biggest lunatic fringe benefit . Beardies and weirdies soon stole the spotlight from the pacifist parsons and left-wing Laborites who started the ban-the-bomb movement . <P> It also became evident that the four-day shuffle was being manipulated by such highly motivated " pilgrims " as Communist agitators , anarchists , and a few thugs to boot . Last week , after the sixth annual spectacular ended in blisters and bombast in Hyde Park , most responsible Britons-including several C.N.D. co-founders-were more eager to ban the march than the bomb . <P> <P> Their disillusionment was the result of a stratagem that struck even the tolerant British as a disloyal act . Even before the marchers left Aldermaston , there appeared copies of a crudely mimeographed , twelve-page document headed : DANGER ! OFFICIAL SECRET . Inside , its anonymous authors declared : " We are Spies for Peace . We have decided to publish an Official Secret . There are thousands more secrets in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release . " The information it contained was , in fact , highly classified : the locations , code names and telephone numbers of twelve Regional Seats of Government from which British authorities would at tempt to restore order in the event of nuclear attack . " This , " exclaimed Home Secretary Henry Brooke , " is the work of a traitor . " <P> <P> By no coincidence , the only emergency headquarters described in detail was R.S.G. 6 , an underground bunker in the Berkshire woods along the marchers ' route from Reading to London . Ignoring C.N.D. officials ' pleas to stay on the main road , 1,000 of some 15,000 marchers left the procession and poured down the country lane marked on the " peace " spies ' map . After a scuffle with police , the shouting demonstrators staged a mass squat around the bunker for more than an hour , until one of their leaders announced : " We have achieved our object . " <P> Whatever their real object , the " spies for peace " triggered a full-scale Scotland Yard investigation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home to London for consultation with his Cabinet . Nevertheless , Canon John Collins , C.N.D. chairman and preceptor of St. Paul 's Cathedral , simpered on TV that most marchers " treated it rather as a joke . " His merriment was not shared by James Cameron , a crusading journalist who has been a prominent figure in C.N.D. since its inception . Cameron conceded sadly that the ban-the-bomb marches had " become a vehicle for too many secondary and dubious intentions . " Admitting belatedly that C.N.D. had been taken for a ride , Cameron cried : " God save us from our friends . "
