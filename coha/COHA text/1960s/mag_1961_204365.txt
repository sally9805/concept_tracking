As India 's armed forces rolled into Goa last week , Indonesia 's jaunty President Sukarno tried to hitch a ride . Standing beneath a canopy in the cultural center of Djokjakarta , Sukarno told a wildly cheering crowd of 100,000 to prepare " for the coming general mobilization of all the Indonesian people soon to liberate West Irian from the claws of Dutch imperialism . My brothers , this is my command ! " <P> West Irian is the Indonesian name for a California-sized island of swamp and jungle that the Dutch call Netherlands New Guinea ( the eastern part of the island is administered by Australia , whose rights there Sukarno so far has not disputed ) . To add muscle to his speech , Sukarno has assembled an invasion army of 16,000 ( backed up by another 100,000 ) on a small group of islands near the coast of New Guinea , which is defended by some 5,000 Dutch soldiers and marines . For air cover Sukarno can use 60 MIG jet fighters and 26 TU-16 bombers supplied him by the Soviet Union . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goa encouraged Sukarno to hope for a cheap victory of his own , it also caused widespread dismay in The Netherlands . Dutch Foreign Minister Joseph Luns , 50 , a strong man in a weak , conservative Cabinet , had based his New Guinea policy on the belief that India 's " peaceable " Nehru would never support military action by Indonesia , and that the U.N . would immediately act against aggression . Now his policy lies in ruins . <P> The cancerous dispute over New Guinea is almost entirely one of national prestige . Sukarno bases his claim on the 1946 agreement between Indonesian leaders and Dutch representatives that gave sovereignty to Indonesia over " the whole territory of the Netherlands Indies . " There were loopholes , however , providing " special arrangements " for regions not wanting to join the Indonesian union . The Dutch did withdraw from some 3,000 islands inhabited by 95 million people , but under the treaty loophole held onto New Guinea , on the ground that the Papuan inhabitants are ethnically , linguistically and religiously different from the Indonesians and ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Indonesia . The Dutch also held that New Guinea could serve as an asylum for some 200,000 Eurasians of mixed Dutch and Indonesian blood who might not wish to live under Indonesia 's new rulers . <P> The then resident Dutch governor offered another explanation : " We are a seafaring , air-minded people . We can not give up our last possession in the Pacific . " <P> Sunken Millions . To the Indonesians , the continued Dutch occupation of barren , poverty-stricken New Guinea represents the loss of one-sixth of the land area of Indonesia , and , valueless or not , they want it . As for the 700,000 Papuan inhabitants of New Guinea , many of them living deep in impenetrable jungle valleys are unaware that there is either a Netherlands or an Indonesia , much less a dispute . The few educated Papuans seem inclined toward independence but recognize their present inability to stand alone .
