Reporting on the tax-accounting practices of 100 major U.S. corporations over a twelve-year period , Price Waterhouse Senior Partner Herman W. Bevis found that the 100 had tucked away $950,189,000 to cover deferred tax payments , but eventually paid out only $20 million of that amount . Thus , indicated Bevis , the true profits of the companies cited were actually about $930 million higher than reported . <P> As more second-quarter and half-year sales and earnings were reported last week , many a corporate executive might wish that stockholders would believe the figures did not really count .

Third-ranked Republic was off 26% for the half-year in earnings , and Inland , Armco , Crucible , Wheeling and Jones &; Laughlin came in with similar returns . <P> AUTOS . Steel 's biggest customers were somewhat better off . General Motors , which suffered a disastrous first quarter as new-car sales slumped , managed a brighter second quarter as springtime customers appeared . Sales rose 1% in the second quarter , to $5.6 billion , and earnings of $522 million were only 4.4% below last year v. a first-quarter profit drop of 34% . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below last year .
