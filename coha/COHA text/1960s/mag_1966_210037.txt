Publisher Sam Newhouse , 70 , finally " bought " Springfield , Mass. , last week . It took him six years of tough scrapping to win control of the town 's three papers : the morning Union , the afternoon News and the Sunday Republican . But as usual , what Sam Newhouse wanted , Sam eventually got . <P> Newhouse already owned 14 other papers , plus Cond Nast publications , when he bought a controlling interest in the Springfield papers back in 1960 . But voting rights to a large block of stock were not to be his until September 1967 . In the meantime that stock was to be voted by the papers ' management , which regarded Newhouse as a foreign raider and would not even let him look at the company 's books . Newhouse fought back by filing a flock of lawsuits ; he charged that the papers ' profits were being haphazardly poured into the already swollen employee pension funds . In turn , the newspapers ran stories belittling their boss-to-be . <P> To Newhouse , the settlement that came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head start as undisputed owner of his new papers . To Springfield staffers , it now means little , if anything . They are already reconciled to the brash outsider . " We have had a lot of opportunity to talk with employees in other Newhouse operations , " says one editor , " and we have n't found anything to get alarmed about . "
