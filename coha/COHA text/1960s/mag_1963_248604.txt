While the cost of living in the U.S. has risen only an average 1% a year since 1957 , the rest of the world is off on a binge of price rises . In 57 non-Communist nations whose productivity is tabulated by the International Monetary Fund , the cost of living has climbed 26.8% since 1958 . It rose 7.9% last year . In the United Kingdom and Germany the cost of living was up 2.8% in 1962 , and in France 5.4% ; Italy has undergone a 6.6% jump in the past twelve months . Booming Japan 's living costs have climbed 6.8% in the first five months of 1963 , enough to threaten Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda 's hopes for a doubled per capita income by 1970 . In Latin America , the increases are stratospheric : Argentina 's cost of living rose 31.5% last year . Chile 's 20.8% , Brazil 's 60.9% . <P> The Latin American spiral is largely the result of instability in the peso , escudo or cruzeiro , which in turn increases import prices and wrecks wage levels . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalty of unpoliced success . Expanding industrial output in the postwar years , these nations tried to avoid labor shortages with higher pay , more overtime and lavish fringe benefits-until wages finally outpaced production . At the same time , increased consumer spending competed for a relatively stable supply of goods and steadily pushed up prices , particularly of food . Britain slowed its spiraling cost of living by instituting a pay pause in 1961 ; Italy granted employees in state industries a massive 53% pay boost last year , far more than Italian private industry granted . <P> The Japanese , those old specialists in low-cost production , are now suffering most among major industrial nations from recent price rises . Spring prices of spinach and radishes , two favorite Japanese vegetables , are up 20% this year . Public bathhouses , government-regulated as utilities , got a 30% price hike in 1961 , but last week owners threatened to strike to gain another 32% . Haircuts in Japan cost 40% more , laundry 30% ; even piano teachers have doubled their fees . Worriedly , Prime Minister Ikeda is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remedy most generally applied in other nations is to ease the duties and quotas on food imports in order to drive down local prices . Unfortunately , such a program has its own built-in hazard : it increases the foreign trade deficits that Japan and every Common Market nation except Germany are faced with .
