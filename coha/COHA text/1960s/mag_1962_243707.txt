Most of the little talks that President Kennedy makes to visiting White House groups-exchange teachers , clubwomen , South Dakota Indians-are about as inspired as the occasions that compel them . <P> But when the guests are young , eager and obviously admiring , the President is apt to linger a bit longer , to say something extra that really matters to him . <P> <P> Waiting to see and hear him on the White House lawn last week were 4,800 college students-the better part of 7.900 just winding up summertime Government jobs ( TIME , Aug. 17 ) . " I wonder , " said the President , " if we could ask how many have become interested in either becoming a politician or a civil servant or a bureaucrat as a result of this summer ? " Perhaps 500 hands went up . " What about the rest of you ? " he asked . The kids laughed . So did Kennedy , as he began taking them on an informal tour through history . <P> " This tree behind me , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built by Harry Truman , and that tree over there was planted by John Adams ; so I think that just visiting this historic house and these grounds does bring you in more intimate contact with American history . <P> " I am always struck by the fact that the U.S. had for a period of 30 years in the Congress the most extraordinarily gifted figures that we have had in our history-Calhoun , Clay , Douglas , Benton and all the rest . And yet they dealt in their whole life with only three or four problems : states ' rights , and the new states coming in , slavery , currency , and two or three others . And yet this extraordinarily gifted group of men failed , and as a result , of course , we had a long and bloody war . <P> " Now perhaps our political leaders may not be so gifted , and yet they deal with questions which are far more complex than the questions which came across the desks of our people a century ago . We deal with questions of monetary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ esoteric-balance of payments , nuclear tests , the mix of our strategic weapons . <P> We have obligations stretching all around the globe ; and yet this country must make not only our society work , but all those societies which are dependent upon us . <P> " I would n't want anyone to sit on the sidelines today when so much goes on in the mainstream ... So I hope that you come in and join us , because the water is not too cold . "
