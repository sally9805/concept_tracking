It is n't every day that a father can shed a political liability and gain a son-in-law . If he had been programmed on a Pentagon computer , Marine Captain Charles S. Robb , the 28-year-old White House social aide who sought and won Lynda Bird Johnson 's hand , could not have turned out better for the President , who had made no secret of his displeasure over Lynda 's long ro mance with draft-deferred Actor George Hamilton . Robb is tall ( 6 ft. 1 ) , dark , handsome , athletic , affable , intelligent , earnest , circumspect-and can hardly wait for his assignment to Viet Nam early next year . And while the first eight qualities are the most likely to put stars in Lynda 's eyes , it is the last attribute that assures there will be no edge to L.B.J. 's voice if he calls Chuck Robb " Charlie , " his cutting private name for Hamilton . <P> At a country fair for children of Government leaders on the White House lawn last week , Lynda showed up , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye-popping expanse of leg-and a five-gallon hat that showed how far Hamilton 's chic influence on her wardrobe had faded . <P> The President 's announcement of a December White House wedding had caught even Press Secretary Liz Carpenter off guard . But a month ago Robb had told his mother and his father , who is the American Airlines ' district sales manager in Milwaukee , that he and Lynda Bird were serious . A dedicated career officer , Robb graduated straight into the Marines in 1961 from the University of Wisconsin , where he garnered a degree in business administration . He first emerged from the pack of personable young officers assigned to White House social duties when he was called to be a fourth at bridge for Lynda and two friends . The foursome soon shrank to a twosome . They spent the Labor Day holiday together outside Rehoboth Beach in Delaware on a stretch of sand known popularly as " Whisky Beach " or " the Passion Pit , " which the Chamber of Commerce now wants renamed more decorously in honor of their courtship .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
