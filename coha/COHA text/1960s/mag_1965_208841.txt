The Third Day . Looking agitated , George Peppard climbs through a broken guardrail , glances below at the riverbank where his Lincoln Continental and a take-home cocktail waitress have come to a bad end . He staggers off to a plush roadhouse where he is eyed knowingly by the bartender , the pianist , and his waiting chauffeur . He blinks , confused , unable to place faces but sensing in the situation something familiar . The familiar something is , of course , amnesia-the basic blackout of more suspense melodramas than most moviegoers care to remember . <P> In Third Day , Peppard learns from a medic that his " memory is on vacation . " But under befuddled Director Jack Smight , none of Peppard 's intimates react like normal human beings to the news that he can not recall his name and address . A dithery old aunt ( Mona Washbourne ) starts spouting reams of plot exposition . His wealthy , neglected young wife ( Elizabeth Ashley ) strikes poses in doorways or on beds as though all the world were a fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clue is the knavery of his wife 's cousin ( Roddy McDowall ) , who schemes to take over and sell the family 's china factory . Though Peppard was once a ne'er-do-well , amnesia has instantly transformed him into a decent chap who knows he is incapable of murder and irresponsible profiteering . He finds a kindred soul in his father-in-law ( Herbert Marshall ) , a tycoon smitten with aphasia and therefore exempted from many a dull speech . Reels later , the hero 's name , his wife 's pretty neck , his marriage and the fine china are salvaged . Actors Peppard and Ashley , a romantic duo off screen as well as on , toil in vain to capture the thrill of it all for posterity . What they see in each other will undoubtedly outlast The Third Day .
