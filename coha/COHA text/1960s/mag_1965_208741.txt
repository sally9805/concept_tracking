Karl Adam , the 216-lb. braunschweiger-built coach of West Germany 's Ratzeburg Rowing Club , is n't boasting when he says , " I have shown I can produce champions year after year . " <P> Since 1953 , when he became Ratzeburg coach , Adam 's piston-smooth crew has won eight German championships , three European titles , one world title ( 1962 ) , an Olympic gold medal and an Olympic silver medal . Drawing on his experience as a physics teacher , he designed a tulip-shaped oar that gets a better bite on the water , conceived the idea of rigging the No. 4 and 5 oars on the starboard side of the shell to reduce veering . He also became the first coach to put his men on a weight-lifting regimen to build shoulder muscles . The only thing that Adam did n't do was learn how to live with the few defeats that came his way . Last year , after Ratzeburg narrowly lost out in the Olympic finals to Philadelphia 's hot-shot Vesper Boat Club , Adam locked himself up in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Adam got his chance for revenge . At England 's 126-year-old Henley Royal Regatta , the Ascot of crew racing , Vesper knocked off Harvard , the best college crew in the U.S. In the finals , to determine the best crew in the world , it was Ratzeburg against Vesper . Ratzeburg led all the way , finished half a length ahead , set a new Henley record of 6 min. 16 sec. for the one-mile and 550-yd. course . <P> That evened the score with Vesper , but it did n't settle anything . Taking up an offer from the Gillette Safety Razor Co. ' s German branch , Vesper agreed to enter the Ratzeburg Regatta and race once again against the powerful West German crew . Last week , on a windless lake close to the little ( pop . 12,123 ) town of Ratzeburg near the Danish frontier , Karl Adam 's husky boys got off with a fast-chopping 50 strokes a minute , built up a one-half-length lead before slowing the pace to 41 strokes . At times , the Vespers pumped away at more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance . Ratzeburg glided past the finish line of the 2,000-meter course a neat 9 ft. ahead . <P> Having proved twice that his crew is the best in the world , Coach Adam , 53 , is thinking of retiring . " I 'm getting older , " he says , " and an older coach does n't have the same contact and relationship with his boys as a younger coach . There is n't the same enthusiasm . " <P> Maybe the Vespers can find a job for him .
