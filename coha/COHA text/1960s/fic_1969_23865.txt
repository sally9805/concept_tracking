a story by Don Mitchell ALCOHOL TRIPPING ellow afternoon , hot and Chay tired of it . Also 1 of traffic doing seventy on the freeway below , of no cars at all on the Ukiah entrance ramp . Where they 'd stood now for an hour ; Chay spreading herself prone across the crabgrass , head on the sleeping bag . Soon they 'd he hitching on the leeway , which was a bust  --  their ride would have to come before the cops did . Meanwhile , Gary walking to the vineyard from which the interchange had been carved , reaching through barbed wire to tear out a bunch of grapes . Half  --  ripe . Too bad , yawned Chay , it 's not a bottle of wine . But trying a couple of them anyway . They 're full of seeds . So they 'll ferment in your stomach , maybe . Why you want to get drunk on a day like this ? Sunshine 's a high , and you know booze is a downer . Because I 'm sick of smoking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drag . Honestly , I Let 's do n't hassle , he shrugged . I guess we try our luck on the freeway , see what happens . Helping her up , walking the curved ramp until it merged with the southbound lanes . And the minute they displayed themselves on this shoulder a pink Cadillac , maybe eight years old , honked at them from the passing lane ; it kept moving , though , and no other friendly gestures . Until fifteen minutes later . the same car squealing to stop behind them , blaring the horn again . Running to it . A convertible , the car 's back scat was filled with vacation gear spilling from under a mildewy tarp ; the driver told them to climb in front  --  four of them in the front seat  --  next to his wife . It 's hard opening that door , yank it good and hard he added . So muscles strained against the doorlatch , Gary sized up the host : bare torso , just beginning to flab beneath hairy camouflage . Still it was impressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnificent . Thick , tough neck to do a wrestler proud , it even seemed his round head tapered from the shoulders up . Brown hair combed straight to the forehead , curling neatly to a halt ; powerful jaw , chin . Gary 's best efforts on the door proved insufficient , so grinning brawn the driver reached one arm to give the required push . Coughing out embarrassment , Gary let Chay in beside the pretty wife , slammed it shut with all his strength . A close fit there , tight but friendly . I 'm Jack , began the driver , gunning it onto the freeway . We passed before but we could n't decideif you were hippies . Besides , we could n't stop . We do n't want no hippies  --  those guys are all hopped up on pills and shit , running around busting each other 's asses . I do n't want my ass busted . Every day you read in the Santa Rosa paper  --  we live in Santa Rosa , this is my wife Lynn  --  you read where somebody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered Gary . We try to look half hip and half straight , then we get rides with both kinds . But we are n't hippies ; and I could use a haircut . My name 's Gary . And this is Chay . You like some grapes ? we picked them right off the vine back there . Handing the bunch to Lynn , taking a good look . More than pretty  --  a complete statement of the long blonde style foreigners call the California Woman . Least touch of azure shadow above , sunburn beneath the eyes highlighted their blues ; none of the features was indelicate or imperfect . Flamboyant orange hat , half  --  blouse breaking into white tassels below full breasts lent a kitschy , highschool-queen quality . Then tapered white slacks and woven high-heeled slippers . The whole package five foot six , hundred five pounds ; no wasted flesh . Lynn refused the grapes politely . Shit man , laughed Jack , you do n't want to eat grapes . You want to drink them . Myself . T prefer beer . You want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grapes out of here  --  Jack tossed them over his head and they splattered be ? hind on the shoulder . Anybody see me do that ? he demanded . Course not . O.K. , Lynn , we need two beers up here . Unless you want a beer ? turning to Chay . Lynn rummaged beneath the tarp , backwards on the seat to expose the other curves . Turning back with the beers , distributing them . You do n't want a beer , she told Chay , we 'll stop down the road for some real juice . Vodka and orange juice , that 's more fun than beer . You like screwdrivers ? Wow , said Chay , I do n't know . I never had one . But I know I hate beer . That 's right , good . You boys drink your beer , we 'll do things our way . Honey , ca n't you stop soon ? It takes me so goddam much to get drunk , anymore . I must be turning into a sieve . I drank rum yesterday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I still was n't really drunk . Lynn , you were so drunk ! Only for half an hour . We had these daiquiris ? and it takes me seventeen daiquiris to get drunk . I can count them right up to sixteen , then on seven-teen I lose count so I know I 'm drunk . I never get drunk on beer . all I do is piss and piss . You have to give me hard stuff or nothing happens . Nothing at all . I 'm a goddamn sieve . Honey , ca n't we stop ? When I finish my beer , Lynn . A mile ahead the freeway degenerated to a two-lane hassle , Sunday traffic struggling to breathe in its polluted exhaust . Gary 's beer tasting cold , even nutritious  --  well , he had n't eaten all day , discounting the dry loaf at breakfast . Neither Lynn 's airy giggles , nor Jack 's husky no-shit would cut the noxious atmosphere better than beer ; Gary feeling already , irreversibly alcohol-tripping . You and your beer . Well , finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turning to push a bag of charcoal back under the tarp . No , laughed Jack . My cousin 's got a house in the mountains . The whole weekend , fishing and swimming and drinking . He 's got so many damn relatives , explained Lynn . They all showed up , they were sleeping on the floor and everything . He 's got seven brothers and sisters , and every one has five or seven kids . And his father 's got six brothers . They 're all intermarried and shit . But they have some great parties , she laughed . Crossing her leg toward Gary . This weekend , Jack announced lighting two Marlboros and giving one to Lynn , this weekend was the first weekend we 've had without the kids in three years . Three years ! So Gary , do n't you ever shit get married , hear ? Wait a minute , are you married ? No , do n't worry , he laughed nervously . Well , do n't get married . What I mean is , do n't get the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I did . And there has n't been a minute 's peace since . Not a Honey , Lynn broke in , you know they have the pill for these kids today . They did n't have that when we were going together . All these girls are on the pill now . Oh . Are you on the pill ? Jack turning on Chay , checking it out . Yes , she answered evenly . But the candor reeling Gary 's head  --  nothing here could seem prying or exposing . Impossible to hide among these baking vineyards , shadeless slices of road . Lynn crowing , see what I mean ? They 're all on the pill nowadays . Well , good for you , Jack extended his hand . I respect you , then . T respect you both . Thanks , they chorused , both shaking the hand . Do n't mention it . You two hitchhike a lot ? Wow , said Chay , we sure have this summer . think we counted up last week , and it was two thousand miles . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Philadelphia Pennsylvania ? asked Lynn . Yes , Chay laughing , I know it sounds far . But we go to college there . And wow , it starts in three weeks . The summer 's gone so fast . Christ , said Jack , I wish you luck getting back . I hitchhiked a lot , when I was younger and single . You meet all kinds of people , do n't you ? Oh wow , Chay nodding her head , that 's just why we do it . Even you people  --  we 'd never have met you if we were n't hitching . Its really beautiful , that and it 's cheap to travel around , see the country . I know . I used to get rides with truckdrivers , mostly . There are some strange bastards driving trucks , too . Most of them are hopped up on pills themselves , Gary suggested . At least the ones we met . One time we Well , I do n't know about that , interrupted Jack . But I never met one that was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was coming back from San Diego . In this guy 's truck , and he says to me , do you mind if I just relax a hit ? I says go ahead , you 're the driver . So he zips down his fly and hangs his dong out over the steering wheel . I mean , he thought it was comfortable . Honey , you know the dirtiest stories ! You are the dirtiest bastard  --  hey , can we stop here ? J ack hit the brakes and vaulted the door , die . appeared briefly into a package store . Returning with a paper bag  --  six-pack of beer , pint of vodka , quart of orange juice , and a dozen plastic cups . Drink away , he commanded , handing Lynn the bag . What 'd you only get , a pint ? Honey , a pint wo n't get us started today . We 're going to have a party ! No halfway drunks allowed . Well , you drink this and I 'll get you some more , hear ? What makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinkers like you are ? She may take three swigs and pass out , like any normal woman . You kill this bottle , I 'll get more . And while I 'm thinking about it , how far are you kids going ? He pulled onto the road again . Berkeley . Christ , all the way to Berkeley ? We 're just going down Santa Rosa . Honey , do we have to go right home ? The sitter 's not in a hurry , she 'll get her money . Could n't we just drive around and have fun , all four of us ? Could n't we ? It 's O.K. with me , Jack shrugged . O.K. with you ? turning to Gary , who turned to Chay . Uncertain eyes , which meant yes . Neither would veto . Sure , Gary nodded , whatever you want to do . Oh , goody ! laughed Lynn , I knew you would . Handing Chay her drink , then digging in the icebox to store the beer . Gary gaped , incredible piece of ass bouncing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two fresh ones . Zip  --  pop-top-flop ! sang Jack , pulling the ring , cold beer in cans . Now what were we talking about before ? Oh , truckdrivers . Like I said , they 're all queer because they been on the road so long , never see their wives . But some of them are just in it for the money . One time this guy picked me up and he had a two-foot dong ! I mean it hung past his knees , even without the hard-on . Two feet ? repeated Gary . Jesus . No shit , you may laugh but he was just a freak of nature . Like a three-legged horse , or a bearded lady . But be used that dong , you know to some rich fairy that 's an all-day sucker . And he sold it for fifty , sixty bucks a night . Wait a minute , how did we get on this subject ? What a conversation ! You big bastard , Lynn giggled , you just like telling your filthy stories . Let 's play the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The antenna wo n't go up , watch this . The antenna was power-controlled from the dashboard , but turning the switch shot the rod up , out of its socket in the fender . Still attached by black wires , the antenna now hung limp over the side ; Jack made Lynn handle the wheel while he leaned out , shoved it back in the hole . Now the radio worked , but only at full volume  --  music blaring from warped speakers , trailing away with the car 's wake . There , honey . You got it . Maybe it works now , but in a minute it 'll fall over . Want a Marlboro ? he offered . You 're in Marlboro country . No , wait a minute . You 're not in Marlboro country . Take one anyway . Laughing , everyone taking a cigarette and lighting up from the match cupped in Jack 's hand . Lynn pouring her fourth screwdriver . These things taste better and better , she gulped . Shit , we 're all going to get drunk and have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's so windy  --  raising a hand to secure it . Armpits freshly shaved . This hat ? Jack flipped it off her head , let it float away with the music . I ley ! You big bastard , I like that hat ! You mean you liked it . Never see it again . Then buy me a new one , you big baby . You have to buy me a new one . You know you never grew up ? kissing hotly his neck , ear , cheek . His reward . Honey , can we go swimming ? I want to wear my bikini , how far is that place on the Russian River ? Christ Lynn , swimming ? Thirty , maybe forty miles , he shrugged . You kids want to go swimming ? Oh , wow yes ! predictable Chay . Wow , swimming ! Wo n't it be cold after dark ? suggested Gary . Hell no , giggled Lynn , we 're going to be so drunk you wo n't feel the water . You wo n't feel anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Good . Honey , can I have another cigarette ? Or just a light , this thing went out . I really smoke too much , I should take up marijuana instead . Marijuana , Lynn ? Jack lit a fresh Marlboro from his own , handed it to her . Shit , you want to get your ass busted ? Lynn shaking her head quickly . stopping her ears . Nobody wants to bust ray ass , Jack . You just think they do . Whenever guyi are around and we 're just having fun , being friendly , you think they want to bust my ass . You get so jealous over nothing , I do n't Lynn , you shut up ! Just shut up ! She may have wanted to hear it ; anyway , she quieted down . Let 's just be happy now , can we ? Can we just be happy this afternoon ? Wow , Chay nodding , I think we can . I 'm sure we can . I 'm happy right now . Me too , belched Gary . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smiling his paradox smile  --  like defining afternoon in terms of sunset , dusk , dark . Like looking for the other side of an open-ended experience . Beer , beer , he belched again . All right , come on now and let 's get drunk ! coached Lynn . A real pep talk , you need more vodka , Chay ? Here . Honey , drive slow a sec while I 'm pouring . Slow like this ? he chuckled  --  swerving out past a sports car , cutting in with inches to spare . Then outblaring the other horns . Honey , Lynn giggling again , now look at this mess . My legs are all sticky with orange juice . My thighs , I mean . Well , they 'll be sticky with something else pretty soon . So you got a head start . Jack , you bastard ! You dirty bastard ! Every  --  I thought you wanted to have fun , Lynn . All of us having fun together , you said that . We 've got even numbers here , and we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score , in case anyone forgot . I did n't forget . Now  --  pointing to the girls  --  you 've got a thing and she 's got a thing . And I 've got a dong and he 's got a dong . Although I 'm not sure , with that haircut . I 've got a dong , agreed Gary . Hysterically . Good , Jack continued . And a dong goes in a thing , right ? So we 're all set up . Wait honey , I just thought of something . Lynn looking mad , cute . These kids here believe in free love . But we do n't believe in free love , do we ? I mean , we got married and all . Jack roaring . Well , we used to believe in free love . But it cost three hundred dollars whenever we had some ! I know , Lynn jumping to steal his next line . I know all about it , nine hundred dollars for free love . Just because they did n't have the pill out . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ Lynn , every single time . Yes I did , you big bastard ! And I 'll get pregnant this time , too  --  wait and see if I do n't ! Lynn suspended now between giggles and rage . I 've forgotten my pill two days now ! You know you get me drinking and I forget my pill . Wow , Lynn , Chay advised solemnly , you should n't forget your pill that way . They do n't work unless Lynn , you shit just take it today , will you ? Shit , take all three of them today ! Nine hundred dollars for three goddamn kids ! Three goddamn kids , and You big bastard , you better shut up or you 're going to have four of them ! You know I forgot my pill now two days in a row , grimacing , stiffening her drink . And I 'll forget it today , if I just get drunk enough ! Lynn , I 'm going to shove those pills right up your ass , so help me . Flight up your goddamn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You need a beer , Gary ? threw his can out . ? gore , I 'll take another . What 's this , three ? Three , four . It 's my sixth . Who cares ? I do n't re Lynn , make sure they 're keeping cold . They 're sitting right on the goddamn ice , Jack . You need more juice , Chay ? nit WOW , thanks . This is  --  I have n't been drunk 6 get drunk , ' 5 ' 0 long , it 's great . It 's  --  wow ! Lynn ? Lynn , tell ) U need wore ot your kids . How old are they ? I want to wris 3W a sec . one 4- e ow their ages . Four . three , and two laughed Lynn , pouring the rving out past . Then they got the pill out . Jack pretends he 0 spare . Then athem , but they 're really little darlings . He s it . Two boys and a  --  no , what am I saying ? this A ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . e My Wow , you must keep pretty busy . oh , I do . I do . Honey , drive slower . Please ? If ' rig else pretty cops stop you again they 'll really throw the ok , I swear to god , bragging to Chay , last week tard ! Every . took his license . He ca n't have it back until ' Lynn . All of v. ember. at . We 've got , Shut up , Lynn , will you ? Jack tried to mimic the score . her voice . Think I do n't know ? Well , watch this : sorting onto a gravel parkout , putting the car through dry skids across the stones . Cut it out , honey ! No , this is fun . You wanted to have fun , Lynn . And it 's safe , too . Nothing Honey , I 'm getting dizzy . I 'm going to Then get dizzy . Ask your friend Gary , he knows a k 's safe to skid on gravel . Do n't you , Gary ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer on his Levi 's . Perfectly safe , yes . Except for the tires , maybe , the tires and no shade . If ! here were shade be might get more into this thing . The beer 'd stay colder longer in his hand , he 'd get down farther . Down into it . And the tires  --  he saw hem full of hot , rubbery air . Dark inside , too , Jesus he was thinking his way down , Jesus . Opening eyes o feel the car straighten back on the highway , pickag up speed . The clock on the dash said four-thirty . We need gas , soon . Lynn and Chay still holding time we had their stomachs from the skidding , laughing out of control . I should say , fill it with oil and check the gas , That 's how this pig ear runs . We need more juice , too , Lynn informed him . folding the bottle to show a bare inch of vodka . Let 's stop in Santa Rosa , honey , get gas and juice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we need the juice first . You have n't killed this one yet , Jack protested . fait it till I see you kill it . ill you ? Shit , Kill it , schmill it ! she pouted , suddenly raising ndred dollars , , . ue Dottie to her lips . Gulping it straight , then chuckamn kids't ing the empty bottle at a telephone pole . I killed it , ' a there ! Now you have to get more . Who the hell cares ? Lynn opening her bottle . Care in the morning , not now . I want to go swimming now . And if he 'd had good tires , Jack would have laid a patch leaving the pumps while the greaser waved , beer in hand . Santa Rosa . Jack beat his way , trial and error , to a rural route west toward the coast and paralleling the Russian River ; scarcely another car on the road . Now , announced Lynn , we 're all going to have a good time ! We 're going to have a party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already having one ! This is so fantastic ! You ever smoke marijuana , Chay ? Lynn asked suddenly . I mean is it true , you get high on it ? Just by smoking ? Wow , yes ! But it 's not like getting drunk , it 's just not the same . Wow , I love this vodka ! That 's what I want . You know who makes vodka ? Russians . Russians make it , and we 're going to the Russian River  --  that 's a coincidence . No , vodka has it all over grass . I do n't care , pouted Lynn pouring another , I 'm sick and tired of getting drunk . I read where marijuana 's cheaper than alcohol , too . It 's cheaper , confirmed Gary . No hangovers , either . Hear that , Jack ? No hangovers ! And I would n't get lung cancer , like I will from all these cigarettes . Would I ? Christ Lynn , all you 'd get is the cops tearing down your door ! Throwing you in jail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopped up on pills and busting No , Jack . I just want to try it once . Just to see . Well , you try anything once and you 're hooked . You 're even hooked on aspirin , Lynn . You 're probably even hooked on vitamins . Try that dope shit once , and I 'll bust your ass myself ! All right , honey , all right . I was just talking . Hey , let 's stop and dance . Ca n't we , Jack ? I like this record . Oh god . I love this record ! she snapped her fingers , honey stop . So he stopped  --  on the pavement since there was no shoulder  --  and all four piled onto the opposite lane . Throbbing without partners in an obscene circle , and somehow no cars passed for two minutes ; at least , Gary thought dimly , they were doing something together . All four and happy . Driving again , they polished off the last beer  --  sharing it . Lynn protested against the men usurping her vodka , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every time I tell you to stick to your beer , but you want my booze . That 's when the trouble starts , every time . You wait till a bar comes , buy some lousy beer . Honestly , Jack With four dollars I 'm buying beer ? That 's all we got left , Lynn ! Four dollars , and the sitter 's going to want something  --  she 's only been there since Friday . Come on Lynn , you 've shit got a whole fifth there . You ca n't drink all that . Wait a minute . you could drink it all . But I 'm not going to let you , hear ? What do you think . Chay ? a conference of whispers . O.K. , Chay says to share it . Russian vodka . Russian River . Chay nodding , yes , she 'd said that . But just remember , Jack . Just remember when en 3 , ca n't handle it , I warned you to stick to your b I hear you , Lynn . I heard you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some drinks . She e u - JI ' Two apiece ; later they held another dancing st ? i this time in couples . Reverse couples , and it a , Jack 's idea . Getting back with Chay next to Jot Lynn and Gary on the right ; drinking and laughia and Gary knowing Chay must pass out anyti. meanwhile little games to play . Like how t - an d you get here ? and here ? Well . She was of experienced . denly a turnoff through trees . Sandy road opeain on a clay clearing where Jack stopped , Soon cooler . Stiffer Stiff sevener seven , mixes nearingnea dusring dusky dark the river , riagvendr coo got - , ti out ; pointing one hundred yards to the mudd hank . O.K. , he announced , everybody goes swill ming . Everybody . The ladies ' bathhouse and hole is thirty paces into those woods , and the men bathhouse and pisshole 's behind the car . All right , agreed Lynn grabbing the bottle , And no drinks in the ladies ' bathhouse ! Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lynn drunk , defiant . Oh , no ! Chay taking up Lynn 's fight . Then w have to have one here . Before we change , we hay to have one here . Hell , we may as well change in the men 's bath house . Lynn leaning into her left hip , pulling thi blouse over her head . Pale pink and lacy and neath . Shit you will ! Jack threw a towel at her ch Shit you will ! There 's laws against that shit , sides we men have morals . Ever hear of mor Lynn ? Shit you did ! Now drink up , and get hell out . Jack , you  --  all right ! She threw her drink at hi picked her suit from the back , and led Chay into the woods . Jack dripping screwdriver , licking it u Now I 'm going to open this goddamn d promised Gary . Staggering all his weight into finding muscles he had n't known about . Gruntini noises . But when the door finally sprung it thr him off balance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roaring . You screwball ! It 's about time you got that op you screwball . You know there 's more muscle my right arm than in your whole body ? You knit that ? Probably true . conceded Gary , rolling out fr under . Then pulling off his pants . Anyway , do n't have to prove it to me . I 'll take your word . I guess you will , screwball . More to drink ? Chi almighty , is that all the dong you got ? You fu with that thing ? Gary panicked into coherence . No , rememb0 ing Toni had examined it and been pleased ; would n't let Jack knock his dong . Yes , I fuck with And it does the job . Ha ! You show that to Lynn , she 'll bust her laughing ! And I 'll bust your ass  --  just remem 88 that . I seen you looking at her , kid . Now where 's yoUr cup ? Jesus , he shrugged , I do n't know . Use any cup . Do n't waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get . O.K. In that case , mark it  --  scratching a G on the bottom with his nail . The games getting rougher , insults uninhibited ; he took a big swig . Holding it under his tongue it turned hot , white hot then tasteless cold . Swallowing the new brew , screwdriver saliva . Drunk on his own juices , thinking his way down . Into it . Pulling on the old jock with limp elastics . Now tell me the truth , you lying bastard : are you going to college ? I said I was . You lying bastard , I do n't believe you 've said anything true yet . But let me tell you this : if you are , I respect you . Because I did n't have the brains to go to college . I did n't even have the brains to finish tenth grade . Shit , I have n't got the brains to open a bottle of beer . No , wait a minute . I do have the brains for that . But look , you son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four years , and you can get a job right off that pays five , six dollars an hour . Pretty soon you 're making fifteen , twenty thousand a year . And that buys a lot of this juice , you son of a bitch . And it do n't matter if you get A 's or just miss failing , it do n't matter as long as you get that diploma . Me , all 1 get is a three-dollar an hour job . And I got four people to spend it besides myself . Gary leaning against the car , trying to sort it out . Even drunk he could see Jack and he were enemies . Natural enemies that should n't have met , that should never meet . Gary out of his proper elich ? and about to get his ass busted . Over this crazy changing partners scene ? Well , not him . No sex was worth that hassle ; belching , he knew it for sure . Not worth it . And Chay ? Jack could have her . No justice , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd keep it intact . Look Jack , I do n't know Shut up , here come the girls . Just remember about Lynn , or Come on , let 's go swimming ! Chay running up ; wow , I 'm so drunk I ca n't stand . Hold me up , Jack ! Hold me A drink first , then we 'll swim , Lynn taking bottle in hand . Gary blinked , and the scene had changed again with Chay looking drab , even virtuous in her red white and blue suit . With a skirt , god yes a skirt on it Ridiculous thing . And the competition , barely wearing her yellow bikini at all . Must have shaved the groin , it hung so far off her hips ! Gary tingling just to look but afraid to touch , it 'd fall right off . It had to fall right off . Revealing shaved groin , huge dripping lips and  --  and he was too small . Jesus , tossing off the round and starting for the river . Walking to Lynn 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack 's shoulders , plunging in first . Chay , who 'd never question a man 's intentions till he got inside ; then maybe look up tosay wow , what are you doing ? That picture amused him , so cannonballing the muddy water with a smile . And Lynn was right  --  he was too far gone to feel temperatures . Twenty yards across but the river ran swift , deep : making for the opposite bank but the good water swept them downstream . Stronger than any of them yet gentle , communal ; they splashed , attacked each other underwater , lost collective balance on the slippery bottom . Then soft hands around his groin , but Chay somewhere upstream . Blonde Lynn rising for air , giggles and why not , honey ? Because of my ass , he murmured . No one wants his ass busted , none of us . Climbing out shivering . Back at the car they threw jackets , sweaters over their suits . Drinking less , dancing more on the sand until the news came on the radio . Ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried anyway . Lynn de-rnanding they find some action , find a bar , find more people more fun more par-ty ! So into the car again . tack driving faster now , Gary was n't sure how fast d but the road was narrow , pitted with holes . All bare legs flanking electrically  --  Jack 's right to Chay 's left , Chay 's right to Gary 's left , Gary 's right to Lynn 's right crossed nicely over her left  --  a fuzzy dream . Lynn egging him on while Chay gargled vodka , and Jack telling a story . About the truck-driver who wanted to suck off in San Jose . How he went so far with the bastard . Then knocked him in the jaw , tied his hands to his hot dong with baling wire and split for the bus depot . That was the last time Jack had hitchhiked . Honey , Lynn yelled across to him , slow down ! Please ? You know you ca n't handle my hard  --  Lynn , shut up . I- Chay screaming tears as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without stopping . I knew this would happen , I knew Stop , you big bastard ! Stop the car ! Lynn shouting until he stopped . Then talking very fast , about if the cops and stick to your beer and is the car O.K. ? Come on , Gary . We better look at the goddamn bumper . Climbing over the door , kneeling with Jack by the front right fender but it was hard to see . No big dents , at any rate . Gary wanting to squirm , wanting to he somewhere else while Jack wheezed and spat on the tire . Rough whispers , Christ almighty bust your ass in two . You lay one hand on Lynn , one hand and Man , Gary shook his head from far away , I 'm not going to touch your wife . You think I 'm crazy ? But I 'll tell you she 's asking for it . I just sit there , and she ? Shut up , you lying bastard ! I 'm watching you , not Lynn . You remember that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten minutes to the 1/ Hacienda Tavern . Glowing in cool neons , and Lynn insisted they join the party ! which could be heard for half it mile . She ran in as soon as Jack stopped ; the others taking time to cover their legs . Inside , a living cartoon  --  happy local crowd doing its happy local thing , fat women and fleshy men and beer across the floor in a sticky flood . Chay lost somewhere but Lynn surrounded by fifteen men . Circled tight in shirt-sleeves , watching her dance with the one who 'd grabbed her first : a short laughing man , dark slacks tapered so slightly and overthe-calf socks . Small-time something in these sticks , but fighting his way thrOugh the press was jealous Jack . Chay lost somewhere , people throwing bottles and everywhere the green neons . Standing on a chair , one stinking woman with black hair and sprawling breasts . In charge , somehow , shouting over all their heads . Who are these creeps ? Get these creeps out of here ! Into the pool ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool ! Longhair first . Come here , longhair . Gary stumbling toward the door when strong arms reached from behind , shoved him to the beery floor . And sure enough a pool around back , swimming pool in green neon as he tried to explain the sweater cost thirty dollars the watch sixty , could he take them off ? Ouch in the stomach to reply , then splash without air and patient searching for the surface . A decent perspective , at least , on the scene : the second splash angrier , thrashing  --  Jack pulled two of his captors in with him . Swinging nine feet down and nine up ; next Chay asking directions to wow , Russia and that was hardly a ripple . Fourth Lynn , accompanied by laughing and laying on of hands . So six heads bobbing in neon water when the last , the biggest , the most surreal splash happened . A whole horse was chased into the pool on top of them  --  blindfolded and kicking wildly  --  ridden bareback by the stinking woman , sprawling breasts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across his right shoulder , but it seemed O.K. apart from the pain . Running to the car where Chay was already sitting , dazed , and unable to speak as the knot of people gravitated from the pool apron towards them . Jack fighting for Lynn and bleeding from the , lip , insults back and forth about who the real creeps were . Terrified Gary holding Chay while someone pissed on the car : then Jack shoved Lynn across the seat , followed her in and floored it in reverse . I 'm coming back with my boys ! he finished up . Get out of here and stay out , you creeps . You goddamn creeps ! and pulling away Gary focused on the faces for the first time . Adult male faces past their prime , and afraid to admit it . Creases under hollowing eyes , receding hairlines . He pitied them . Back on the road , Lynn pissed to hell . You dirty bastard , do you know you 're a dirty bastard ? she screamed dripping wet . Every time we start having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go crazy like this . You pick a fight and wreck it all , you dirty bastard . Anytime I Shut up , Lynn ! driving very fast somewhere , and finally dark out . Christ almighty Lynn , your good friendly people all want one thing , just one thing and that 's a piece of your goddamn ass . Jack , you 're the dirtiest , stupidest , jealousest dirty bastard I ever met . She began to cry , salt tears over cheeks dripping chlorine neon , those were good people . Friendly people . I know , I was talking to them . Were you talking to them ? No . You 've always got to he the he-man , the big jealous bastard . You always have to He hit her twice , hard hack of his hand against her mouth and she fell across Gary and Chay . Soft sobs into their laps , then quiet until Jack began heaving his stomach over the side . Lynn sat up suddenly , telling him again to stop the car . You ca n't drive this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangely with the blood and vomit mixing on his chin , Gary you drive us back to Santa Rosa , hear ? O.K. mumbled Gary without thinking , up over the door then getting in behind the wheel . Just straight on this road , right ? Yes , coaxed Lynn squeezing next to him . It 's around thirty miles . You can drive slow , you do n't need to show off like Lynn ! You shit Jack , none of this would happen if you 'd stick to your lousy beer . None of this ! You ca n't handle hard liquor , Jack . And you know it , every time you start  --  she stopped talking when he passed out . Gary put it in gear , eased down the black road . All four soaking wet in all their clothes ; he stayed awake on shivers for a while , then slipped into gentle hypnosis . It was the white lines doing it , they flicked from the windshield to the rear-view mirror in a constant , preordained rhythm . So he could n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty . Smoking Marlboros to sense passing time . Be . cause the whole trip seemed maybe thirty seconds ' daydream . Voices around him : Chay consoling Lynn about Jack . He wants to be a man , he has to keep proving it . Reminds me of my little brother , pass the vodka please . Lynn pouting , still chugging away . He never grew up . But he can screw , I swear to god Chay , he 'll wake up and want to screw . Screw us both , I swear it to god , at the same time . Wow , wow . And do n't laugh , it 'll be good . There 's nobody to match him at that . Really , nobody . Another cigarette , chain-smoking because all the matches were gone . Dead pain in his right shoulder , now let 's all be happy and par-ty ! Get the radio on ; Gary pushed the antenna button and the chrome thing repeated its anti-phallic act . He let it hang . Lynn asking now about marijuana , could we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into bars , different bars and you 'd find some hippies . Real hippies with dope , I only want to try the stuff once . No hippies in bars anymore , giggled Chay . They do n't know what the Russians are into , either . Stonefreak Russians ! No marijuana , we had some yesterday but we smoked it . Gary sinking deeper , lighting the next chunk of Marlboro country . A strange taste as Jack stirred now , stirred to sandwich himself between the girls . Quiet and windy cold driving , chilly vineyards around and Chay 's muffled wows . Could he look ? Yes : Jack with a finger in Chay , whole goddamn fist in Lynn . Clock reading twelve-fifteen time for bed time for , bed . He was losing his mind . Chay killing the bottle this time , schmilling it over the side bye-bye , Russians . Muffled wows around the quiet trio , Gary still hanging on the lines . Then a widening of roads ; yellow freeway lights ahead . Braking down as Jack worked his hands free , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hassle . Wow , said Chay , it 's been fantastic ! Wow , we We sure had a time , laughed Lynn . We had a real time , all of us tonight ! Kissing him goodbye which must have been nice , but he could n't tell . Could n't feel it . Whispering some other time , yes ? And bring some marijuana . Sure , another time . Jack ? Have a nice life Jack . You too , you son of a bitch . Laughing now , all of them laughing because it was over . Do n't get your ass busted from here to the library ! Sure you 'll get a ride now ? South anywhere south , we 'll be fine . Got all the stuff , Chay ? Wow , I think  --  who cares ? We got the sleeping bag , what else was there ? I ca n't think about it . Bye Lynn  --  wow , do n't forget your pill tonight . Remind her , Jack . Yes . Kissing goodbye . Yes . Moving away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink Cadillac in the northbound taillights . Gary , Chay back on the ramps and alone together . Jesus , Gary began to Chay . Jesus F. Christ . You all right , you little dick-tease ? Just coming down off the white lines . I 'm fine , she said uncertainly , except  --  I need you Gary . Inside , now . Could you do it ? Looping an arm around his neck . Oh fuck , Chay . After what / just  --  what I thought I just saw , after  --  look , I 'm drunk as a Please ? Leave me alone , will you ? Wasted . I 'm wasted . I 'm dreaming , I'm -- look , it 's not my fault you 're all hot to go . Now is it ? That 's just the point , shithead . You shithead . Shut up ! trying to handle her as Jack would , but the voice lacking something . Let 's just get a goddamn ride , O.K. ? Talk in the morning . Sorting out the ramps , walking to the southbound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before an ancient black sedan pulled off the feeder read  --  and spilled out four hippies who ran to them . Familiar strangers in funny clothes , eager to love on principle . Wow , where are you going ? Berkeley answered Chay , teeth chattering . Berkeley , wow ! Berkeley ! Wow , this time of night ? The man onto you ? No , she giggled . It 's just our thing , Wow , these Russians brought us vod- Good luck , that 's a groove . We 've got a pad down the road , if you want to warm up or crash , or  --  no ? Then wait here . Retreating to their car . Damn hippies , spat Gary . Trying to find the irony , oh yes , Santa Rosa hippies . Running around busting each other 's asses , every day you read in the Santa Rosa paper , you read Shut up ! Chay kissed him . The hippies returning now . Sorry , said their spokesman , we ca n't , uh , do your thing here with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without some grass , right ? Wow ! said Chay . Oh wow , wow ! The Russians took away their Jesus , said Gary , thanks a lot . Just what I needed . Right . So here 's a couple of joints to make your trip . Maintain , O.K. ? The sedan coughed to a start , drifting into darkness while Chay lit up the first of diem . Smoking in silence . righteous . Wow Gary , I do n't believe this ! It never stops , I mean wow ! I do n't believe this . I do n't either . Let 's go to sleep , O.K. ? Because there were some trees alongside the freeway .
