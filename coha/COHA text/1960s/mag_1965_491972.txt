The great idea boyBy Lewis II . Upham ? Photographs by Mark Kauffman RUM GERNREICH comes to New York City twice a year , a small and often whimsical man dreaming of orange polka dots on purple silk , and girls with artificial flowers on their ears . His approach from Los Angeles invariably foretells a period of unrest and upheaval in the fashion world . The sophisticated ladies who rule that world , recognizing Gernreich as a visitor from what Harper 's Bazaar once called " the wilder shores of chic . " wait eagerly for his newest outrage . Mindful of his reputation as the most extreme , the farthest-out of all American dress designers , Rudi seldom disappoints them . Last spring , of course , he brought the topless bathing suit . Its appearance , first in magazine and newspaper photographs and then in store windows , let loose a breathless furor that soon engulfed the civilized world . The publicity lasted almost three months , which , although roughly equivalent to the adult life of a swallowtail butterfly , is considered a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garment center . Opinion divided sharply among those who thought the bathing suit the harbinger of a new emancipation and those who dismissed it as a preposterous joke . hcestra , the Soviet Government 's newspaper in Moscow , denounced it as the product of a " decadent , money-bag society . " In Paris a couturier named Jacques Esterel , desperate to follow the trend of unexpected nakedness but hard pressed for a new angle , instructed one of his models to shave her head . On his next trip to New York , in late October , Rudi brought the " no-bra " brassiere , a transparent device to be worn under loose dresses or blouses , preferably also transparent . Although failing to excite the public imagination to the same degree of intensity as did the bathing suit , the bra promises to afford a sufficiently chic subject for interminable small talk during this winter 's social season . It is to be lot-lowed by the " no-back bra " and the " no-side bra " this spring , according to Exquisite Form , the manufacturer . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasions repeated use of the adjectives " amusing , " " adorable " and " divine . " To the ladies who deal in these definitions the words presumably convey clear and specific meanings , but to anybody unfamiliar with the correct terminology they remain dishearteningly vague . The problem of communication is one to which Gernreich has long been accustomed . From his place at the forefront of the avant-garde he finds it troublesome to relay his dreams and visions to the main column of troops . The buyers for the larger department stores , timorous individuals loyal to the taste of the American housewife as computed by statistical averages , incline to suspect that Gernreich might be leading them off on hopelessly quixotic expeditions . This difficulty became apparent last summer in the midst of the bathing-suit crisis . So many people seemed to miss the point . At the height of the crisis Gernreich staged a news conference and fashion show in his New York hotel , hoping to provide , as they say at State Department briefings , " clarification and background . " Although the presentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least offer an introduction to Gernreich 's idea of fashion . Smoking a long , black cigarette , he stood in the center of a room painted the color of summer squash . His appearance confirmed the rumors of a resemblance to a leprechaun . A lithe . almost elfin figure , he wore rakishly pointed shoes and a jacket made from the skins of Burmese water snakes . He spoke in a soft voice edged with faint irony , as if nothing he said should be taken very seriously . The expression in his eyes revealed a subtle and intelligent man rescued from despair by a humorous sense of the absurd . " If the bathing suit 's a joke , " he said , referring to the interpretation then dominant in the daily press , " it 's not a joke because of itself , but because of what 's happening in the world  --  which seems to me either funny or horrible , according to how you feel when you get up in the morning . " Except for that one remark , a casual aside in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glossy chatter that serves as the lingua franca of the fashion world . To a girl in a blue hat , he said , as if imparting a dreadful secret to a wondering child , " design for the ugly people . " The girl , who had just managed a complicated entrance involving an umbrella , a Pekingese and a shopping bag , giggled nervously , not quite recognizing the implied parody of Vogue 's category , " the beautiful people . " " Oh , yes , 1 see , " she said blankly . " Of course . " Among the women eventually seated on sofas around the room were Barbra Streisand , the actress ; Eugenia Sheppard , the women 's feature editor for the New York Herald Tribune , and several scouts from Harper 's Bazaar . Miss Streisand preserved a decorous silence all afternoon , peeking out at the proceedings from under a large and floppy hat . She seemed to admire the feathers and the boots . Miss Sheppard , however , advanced an opinion on any and all matters of interest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . commands as much attention on Seventh Avenue as do the political columns of James Reston and Walter Lippmann on Capitol Hill . Of Gernreich she said , " Either you get the message or you hate him .... The great idea boy in the business , but sometimes it 's more idea than most women can cope with . " At 42 , still a young age in the fashion business , Gernreich bases his reputation as a creator of sports clothes on two categories of design . The ' first of these , his experimental work , includes , among other whimsies , a felt shift so stiff and so straight that it stands by itself and a knit bathing suit to be worn with plastic fishermen 's boots and a plastic headpiece resembling a welder 's mask . The second and more substantial category includes the designs that were considered outlandish innovations several years ago but now are accepted as standard items . It was Gernreich , for instance , who first made the shirtwaist dress in expensive materials , who first combined stripes and polka dots in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interior foundation . " All now classic stuff . " Miss Sheppard said , referring to the latter category , " but they are not always so good on suburban matrons . " The women who wear Gernreich 's clothes incline to be young , lean and urbane , living for the most part in New York , Los Angeles and Dallas . The Gernreich " look " demands a flamboyant , if not aggressive , sophistication not often found in Scarsdale or Wichita . Asked to characterize Rudi 's clientele , Amelia Gray , the owner of a fashionable dress shop in Beverly Hills , once said , " Oh , you know , people who go here and there  --  the international set , not just dreary , drab personalities . " On that hectic , summer afternoon in New York , Gernreich 's favorite model , Peggy Moffitt , showed the entire collection . A tall and eccentric-looking girl , her hair cut severely short like a boy 's , her eyelids painted bright orange , she presented herself with the exaggerated melodrama of a heroine playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a few remarks about the cost of each costume . ( His knit dresses and suits , manufactured by Harmon Knitwear , sell at prices of $59 to $79 ; his designs in more costly materials sell for $79 to $500 . ) Peggy suited her walk to her idea of the mood inherent in whatever she was wearing . Sometimes she minced across the room , sometimes she slunk or marched or fluttered . For her entrance in a lace dress she came in on her toes , like a ballerina fleeing a monster in a forest . In lounging pajamas she stood as if leaning against a 30-knot wind on the deck of a sailboat . When the costume involved an outer coat that gave way to reveal a dress in another material or pattern , she took off the coat with a gesture of hopeless resignation , as if surrendering a city . The clothes satisfied everybody 's longing for the weird , the dramatic , the uncompromising . There were leather suits and loudly striped stockings , reversible jumpers , aviator suits , helmet-hats and ostrich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barber poles or billboard advertisements , modulated from purple to lavender to hot pink to - mirky eggplant . The violence of the colors and the design bludgeoned the onlooker into sudden attention . Some of the costumes , causing the same kind of confusion as certain abstract paintings , looked as if they could be worn backward with the same effect . " My dear , " said a lady in ruffles , " it 's pop art . " " Big clothes , " said the girl in the blue hat . " A mouse could n't wear Rudi 's things and come off right . You have to have a personality . I mean , you could n't hide anywhere . " Although Peggy did not model the topless bathing suit ( she did so only once , for photographs taken by her husband ) , she did appear in a transparent chiffon blouse . Rudi had not yet invented the no-bra brassiere . Many ladies gasped . Miss Sheppard , a hardened reporter before whom even French designers tremble , remained impassive . " It 's very square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . inadvertentlypredicting future developments . " If you have to wear a bra , then do n't wear Rudi . " At the end of the show the women from Harper 's Bazaar left in an excited rush . Watching them depart , unable to hear their specific comments but satisfied with the burbling murmur of their voices , Gernreich leaned calmly against a wall , waving good-bye . His serene pose suggested a shepherd in an upland meadow listening to the restful bleating of his flock . " I 've gone awfully far , of course , " he said . " I think more people are shocked than pleased . " In the dressing room , surrounded by tissue papers , hangers , lipsticks , powder puffs and discarded clothes , Peggy Moffitt , also smoking a black cigarette , stared at herself in a mirror . " Rudi is the only person I know who makes complete sense to me , " she said . " Sometimes I 'm not even sure about myself . " As an editor of a new magazine called Cinema . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WEAR TO AN ORGY . " The secret , " she suggested , " is not to be overlooked . If you look better without clothes , then do n't wear them . " Rudi 's designs are in the right spirit , she says . The sense in Gernreich 's apparent craziness , obscured by the traditional formalities of New York , becomes clear in Southern California . The climate suits him ; so does the prevailing casual manner of dress and social custom . His use of color , which seems garish in a colder climate , appears reasonable against the bleak landscape and the washed-out blue of the sky , His idea of " the little nothing dress " ( based on the idea that clothes should possess the invaluable " throw away look " ) also seems reasonable when understood as an aspect of the cultural change that has moved eastward from California over the last 20 years . In California , for example , the supermarket , the freeway , the drive-in movie and the split-level house reached their full flowering . All these things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country with alarm and suspicion . Gernreich moved to Los Angeles with his mother in the late 1930 's . Born into a cultivated Jewish family in Vienna , he briefly attended college , danced for a few years with a modern dance troupe and otherwise found occasional employment on the edges of the fashion world , designing textiles and advertisements or wirking in the costume department at M-G-M . From these miscellaneous beginnings , he emerged in 1952 as a designer for Walter Bass . Bass , also a displaced Viennese , manufactured tailored suits for women . He hired Gernreich because he liked his sketches and thought he saw in them a " tremendous sense of line and an absolute pitch for color . " The two men sold their clothes through Jax , a retail store subsquently made famous for what is in part the Gernreich look . They dissolved their alliance in 1959 , and . two years later . dissociating himself also from Jax . Gernreich established his own firm . Now confronted with the problem of marketing his clothes as well as designing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his factory and his split-level house in the Hollywood Hills . A shy and elusive man , avoiding unnecessary appearances at movie openings and other social events , he is content to read French novels and feed his goldfish . Unlike other prominent figures in the fashion world , he refuses to discuss the details of his private life . His friends , however , mention particularly his kindness . His mother , to whom he was deeply attached , died of cancer last spring , just before Rudi 's triumphant journey to New York . During the last six months of her life he went to see her four times a day . His house in Laurel Canyon suggests a delicate and eclectic sensibility . The goldfish swim in a pool on a roof . Through the wide windows in the living room , beyond the eucalyptus trees in the foreground , the view gives out onto brown hills and . below in the distance . the pastel clutter of downtown Los Angeles . Scattered among the books on the library shelves stand miniature ele ? phants carved from lapis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the niche of a Byzantine church on the Greek island of Isilikonos . In the front yard . behind a discreet redwood fence , there is a swimming pool : in the garage there is a white Jaguar . The factory , conversely , is conventional and drab , occupying the second floor of a two-story stucco building on Santa Monica Boulevard . The ground floor provides space for a barbershop and a liquor store . At the head of a flight of concrete stairs leading up from the street , Gernreich has his studio in a sunny room overlooking a parking lot . There , on a morning in early fall , he seemed more at ease than he had in New York . He was wearing corduroy pants , a black T-shirt , a black ascot with white polka dots and dark glasses in the shape of perfect circles . He takes comfort in the presence of the 10 or 12 people who work for him and who delight in his odd habits and his puckish humor . Mrs. May Hunau , his chief assistant for the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the moon-faced boy-child . " On Ruth 's return from New York she presented him with several scrapbooks in which she had begun to paste some of the 20,000 newspaper clippings and many of the letters that arrived during his absence . " A hero , " Mrs. Hunau said , " a national celebrity no less . " The letters and the clippings referred . of course , to the topless bathing suit . Much to his surprise , Gernreich sold 3,000 suits at about $24 each . Most of the letters , from women identifying themselves as wives , mothers and defenders of the public morality in their respective communities , condemned him for a wicked charlatan . One of these , typical of the rest , began ; " Dear Mr. Gernreich : You must be as low as your swimsuit . " Tearing the letter into neat little squares , Rudi dropped them , one by one , into an ashtray . He did so with an abstracted , far-off look in his eyes . They miss the point , you see , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foists his own crazy ideas on a helpless public , but a designer does nothing more than reflect what he thinks he sees going on in the world  --  it 's quite a trivial occupation . " To him the bathing suit seemed nothing more than the logical overstatement of a familiar idea . Somewhat extreme , perhaps , and certainly not intended for public beaches , but hardly scandalous . For years his clothes have shown a gradual diminishing of fabric ( cutout bathing suits , holes in print dresses , etc. ) , a tendency he believes corresponds to a mood of defiance among the younger generation . " Twenty years ago . " he said , " a young girl was supposed to look sweet and innocent . But that ideal no longer applies . Before they 're seventeen they cultivate a wild , conscious , sexy look , which is very unnerving . " The aristocracy of the world no longer sets the fashions . The society people get it from the hip young actors and actresses in New York , or the kids in the discothtlques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the motor cycle crowd on Sunset Boulevard  --  the delinquent element . " He shrugged and opened another box of black cigarettes . " The generation feels defeated : nothing seems to make any difference . The look in clothes expresses an anti-attitude. the result of being bored  --  bored by being told what to do , bored by the hopelessness of the bomb and the abstractions of government , bored by sexual discovery in high school . And so , if you 're bored , you go for the outrageous gesture . Everything else seems to have lost any meaning . " Handing a fashion magazine across the desk , he pointed to a photograph of a coat that was yellow on one side and purple on the other . " Surrealistic. " he said . " It 's so ugly it 's beautiful . " The girl in the photograph led him to mention the masculine influences on women 's clothes . Under the coat she wore corduroy pants and heavy boots , giving her the appearance of a nice young lady who would kick in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become more dominant in society , " Gernreich said , " their clothes acquire masculine prerogatives : pants , boots , work shirts , raincoats , things like that . Nothing can be done about it . It certainly is n't my fault . " He spread his hands in a gesture intended to absolve him of any responsibility from the absurd follies of his contemporaries . His round and sorrowful face briefly assumed the same ambiguous expression , half-amused and half-appalled , with which he had confronted the fashion reporters in New York . Any further conversation seemed futile . On a phonograph record in another room a trio of rock-'n ' - roll singers sang about love on a surfboard . Below , in the parking lot , a young man in a fuzzy sweater was teaching a pair of wolfhounds to balance on the back of his sports car . Mrs. Hunau came in to say that Phyllis Diller , the comedienne , had telephoned to ask about the harem pants in red silk .               @ @ @ @ @ @
