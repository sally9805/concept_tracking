txt The Common Market reached the final essential resolution of long and deep-seated differences over farm policy shortly before daybreak today . Just seven weeks ago , President de Gaulle of France was threatening to wreck the historic postwar movement to unify Western Europe if industrial West Germany continued to block France 's vital farm interests . This morning , his menacing firmness seemed to have given the movement a new and decisive thrust . Foreign ministers , agriculture , ministers , weary translators and more than 100 other func- , tionaries , high and low , labored ' almost twice around the clock to achieve the agreement . It was their second marathon meeting in three days . They brought forth a major accomplishment . Issues Noted The issues that stymied the first session and prolonged the second one were the unexpectedly stubborn demands of Italy . But the major issue was Germany 's refusal for seven years , since the trade bloc was established , to strike a deal on wheat by cutting German prices . The members of the bloc are Germany , France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are forming an economic union , and perhaps ultimately a political one . For such a union to be complete , it must include a common farm policy , and farm policy can not be common unless prices are . The common price that has been established now for wheat , effective in mid-1967 , is $106.25 a ton . German Levels Cut For German farmers this is a cut of 11 per cent and more from present German levels , and for French farmers an increase of S per cent and more . Germany came to terms Monday night on the compensation that her farmers will receive from the Common Market 's farm subsidy fund to help cover their losses ? $280 million in three diminishing annual installments . The West German Government had asked for twice as much . But on this point , as on almost all others , Germany finally yielded completely to proposals that it had rejected almost to the end . The pressure on Germany to settle had been intense from the United States as well as from the rest of Europe . Shortly after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . the negotiations adjourned for the preparation of a final compromise draft by the Common Market 's executive commission . At 2 . ' A.M. , Foreign Minister Maurice Couve de Murville and Finance Minister Valery Giscard d'Estaing of France flew in from Paris . At 4:40 A.M. a waiter took a tray of drinks in . At 5:30 A.M. there was applause . Italy 's stubbornness was as much a result of her shaky Government as of her particular farm interests . The Italian Parliament meets tomorrow to elect a new President . The office is not particularly powerful , but the stability of ' Premier Aldo Moro 's governing coalition is so delicate that anything might upset it . It was not an easy time for Italy to be flexible . Italy 's Agriculture Minister , Mario Ferrari-Aggradi , opened the play yesterday by stating that his Government would accept one of the special deals that he had hesitated about during the Saturday-Sunday marathon . He was too late . The others said that , on second thought , they felt the deal had been too generous . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatened to walk out on it . The issue was the ceiling on Italy 's annual commitment to the trade bloc 's farm-subsidy fund . Italy is committed to contribute up to 28 per cent of the fund 's resources now . She sought a cut to 15 per cent . She was offered 18 per cent late Sunday morning , but when she accepted it yesterday she found that - it had been raised in the meantime . - It became a " little country " issue . The little countries in the Common Market insisted that Italy , which has bigger voting power than they in the trade bloc 's affairs , should have a higher financial responsibility . Germany , for her part , appeared to be in a hurry to settle . Having made her big and difficult concessions , she wanted the matter to be done with . Edmund Rehwinkel , head of the German Farmers Union , was firing off well-publicized telegrams to the Government criticizing what Bonn 's negotiators had done . While the details of what would be included in the final agreement were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not be included ? namely , all of the non-agricultural issues that had been booked for decision in the annual yearend decision making . These included the merger of the Common Market 's Executive Commission with the commissions of the European Coal and Steel Community and Euratom , discussion of political unification , plans for the Kennedy round of tariff negotiations , and more . The farm issues were enough by themselves . Cliff-hanging day-and-night sessions have become the Common Market 's way of making the decisions that will not come if the atmosphere is relaxed , But this time the negotiators appeared to have left themselves dangling prematurely . They thought they could make their settlement in one long meeting over the weekend . They sailed into the weekend meeting because they did not anticipate Italy 's inflexibility with big concessions ? most importantly Germany 's concession on wheat prices . But Italy stopped all this . And so it was necessary to crank up a new crisis on smaller issues . The highlights of the final settlement were as follows : - Prices  --  Barley , $91.25 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for producers and $125 for users  --  Italy 's pasta makers ; corn , $00.63 , and Italy will get special payments for five years starting at $10.63 on a sliding scale . Subsidy Flid  --  The ceiling on Italy 's contributions to the Common Market 's farm fund will be cut to 18 per cent of the fund 's resources in 1965-66 and 22 per cent in the following year . Contributions for later years will be negotiated next spring . Fruits and Vegetables ? On Italy 's demand , the trade bloc 's Commission is to draw up a plan for protecting fruit and vegetables against imports , by curbs or supports .
