The electorate , as in the ast , was a panel of 600 fashion authorities using a ballot drawn up by representatives of 12 of the nation 's finest stores . The platform that won for the Lazars was built around the little knitted suit and their mastery of it over a dozen years . In electing the Lazars the panel has voted in behalf of the American traveling public and in recognition of enthusiasts who favor Kimberly knits for everything from an afternoon of bridge to an afternoon at the races . Anne Fogarty piled up her votes in one year , during which she has stamped her personality on sportswear that is as much to be spectated at as to spectate or perform in see her swimsuit for dry land on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that the greatest contribution I have made to sportswear is that of femininity . " The Lazars , whose award , rather like the Nobel Prize , reflects accomplishments over the span of a decade or more , have been in business together since 194'i ' , shortly after Jack finished World War II service in the Philippines with the Army 's combat engineers . He saw a future for clothes that could keep pace with a public free to travel with foreseeable ease around the world . Their first continued @#  | knit-dress designs were wool chenilles , the fuzzy-surfaced , form-fitting type of dresses that , as Jack recalls , " made every man on the street turn around and watch . " Women were attracted in steadily growing numbers , too ? so much so that when LIFE did a fashion report of the impact of the sack in America it found 24 members of a ladies ' club in Kentucky wearing one particular Lazar style . The firm followed sacks with trapezes until , disillusioned with the quick rise and fall of Paris silhouettes , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more solid basis for fashion interest . This is their format today . They concentrate on wearable silhouettes which change subtly from season to season . The Lazars vary them with new colors and patterns , such as Argyle and hound'stooth checks , which were introduced last fall and are part of the summer collection ( see below ) . The Lazars feel that their greatest contribution has been in developing new patterns on knitting machines that are so intricate that one correction requires two weeks for repatterning an entire machine . They are proud of having developed a year-round demand for wool knits and are selling summer wools for the first time . Their firm is also recognized for pioneering with different fibers in their search for a travel costume which will never wrinkle or sag . They were the first to work with Orlon filament and the first to learn how to dye the yarn satisfactorily . They combined linen and rayon for a knit with a natural string look ; they also experimented with silk knits in 1957 .

Anne Fogarty admits that she is a completely subjective designer and makes clothes that she likes to wear herself . She believes that a successful wife , for example , should " dress for everything , " and the approach to any situation is , in the mind of this designer , consolidated first of all by deciding what to wear . For doing housework Mrs. Fogarty believes in wearing coveralls ; so she designs coveralls that are made like a garage  | mechanic 's but are embroidered wit pink and red carnations . For entertaining at home she wears strictl tailored pants and shirt , but in gold lame ( see page 35 ) . Fogarty denims have candy-color stripes , and most shorts and pants have lace edging .
