" I keep hearing a great river of sound flowing around me , " says Japanese Composer Toru Takemitsu , " like machines grinding away or air whooshing out of a ventilation duct , or voices of people talking with each other . As a composer , I merely dip my hands into this river and ascertain the meaning of whatever sounds I 've fished from it . " <P> His catches have been fashioned into jazz pieces and film scores ( Woman in the Dunes ) , but it is his avant-garde compositions that have made Takemitsu , at 37 , Japan 's leading exponent of a new , totally modern yet distinctly native musical style . He scored R I N G , a plaintive , murmuring piece for flute , lute and guitar , not with notes but with a diagram of a circle containing directional signals for time , dynamics and pitch . In Corona for Strings , he achieved wispy as well as grating effects by directing the instrumentalists to improvise on the basis of colored plastic disks superimposed on their parts ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <P> Last week Takemitsu 's latest piece , which had been commissioned by the New York Philharmonic , received its world premiere in Manhattan under the assured baton of Seiji Ozawa . Confirming Ozawa 's observation that Takemitsu " paints in watercolors , " November Steps created a 23-minute mood of hushed mystery that was almost visual in its stunning impact . The strings whirred and chattered , spinning out a web of shimmering sonority into which the winds and brass poked tiny pin points , like stars among scudding clouds . Through it all one black-and-grey-robed soloist warbled the mournful , breathy tones of the shakuhachi , a bamboo flute , while another tapped the strings of the lutelike biwa with a wooden plectrum , suggesting the sharp , dry crunch of dead branches in an icy forest . <P> It was a typical Takemitsu device to play off a standard Western orchestra against ancient , unusual Japanese instruments . Such traditional borrowings are his way of shaping what he scoops from his river of sound . Yet if the form still seemed elusive to the Philharmonic audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Not for him the lucid structure of a Beethoven Ninth Symphony . " It 's a great architectural monument , " he says , " but it 's not my kind of music because it draws a distinction between man and nature . My music must represent efforts at becoming unified with nature . The composer 's mission is to present sound in the original , unpolished form . "
