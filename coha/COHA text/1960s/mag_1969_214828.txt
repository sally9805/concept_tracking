TERRA AMATA by J.M.G. Le Clzio. 217 pages . Atheneum. $5.95 . <P> <P> The Germans may have the word for it : Weltschmerz . But French writers have a long tradition in it too-a literary bleating of the young in which the gyrations of the ephemeral self and the monumental turnings of the solar system get dizzily confused . J.M.G. Le Clzio is a handsome lad of 29 with sporting initials and a static style who has in recent years been a flashily successful practitioner of that mournful art . His first book , The Interrogation , a kind of Krapp 's First Tape , won France 's third most prestigious literary award , the Prix Renaudot . His second novel , The Flood , a further torrent of talent and eloquence put mainly to the purposes of adolescent simpering , was also drowned with praise . But it is doubtful if any amount of critical bolstering will be able to shore up his latest novel , which reads a bit like an endless progressive-rock lyric in search of a psychedelic score . <P> For Terra Arnata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another of those nobodies who do nothing . The reader first meets him as a child playing God with potato bugs , and gradually watches him emerge pretty much as a bugged vegetable himself . In a series of widely spaced vignettes , portrayed as through a wobbly hand-held camera , he attends his father 's funeral , makes desultory love to a nondescript girl in a hotel room , gets married , has a son , and finally dies . In between , he takes long walks , smokes endless cigarettes , compiles lists , uninventively takes inventories , floats cosmically , and grunts romantically . <P> To be sure , Le Clzio asks big questions , such as What is Life ? with an earnest lyric gift . At times he captures the bubble-like transiency of youth with touching Gallic elan ( " Who wrote ' I love you ' on a cigarette paper and then smoked it ? Who picked a flower and put it in a glass of water ? Who ate a vanilla ice on September 14 , 1966 , at twenty-five minutes to midnight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eternal ice , an eternal yellow-white flavour ? " ) . He is also adept at playing those " In " games French readers love , the sounding of literary resonances from Pascal to Robbe-Grillet . <P> Such native stylistic ploys , like poetry , suffer dreadfully even in the best of translations , and this one , by Barbara Bray , is much too stiff-lipped , too unbendingly British . Ultimately , what does Le Clzio in , is his decision to mirror his **33;3078;TOOLONG view in its own terms . All arbitrary mood and no movement ca n't help making for a dull book . " Nothing is necessary any more , " concludes the non-hero cryptically as he is being buried . " But neither is anything unnecessary . " That phlegmatic formulation ought to come as some sort of wan , stoical triumph . In context it seems pretentious and enigmatic .
