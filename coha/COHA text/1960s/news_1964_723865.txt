txt London Almost universal approval has greeted the British Government 's plan to pay state compensation to victims of crimes of violence . This is said to be only the second such plan to be operated in the world . New Zealand introduced a similar compensation plan about three months ago . British Home Secretary Henry Brooke therefore has little experience to draw on for his plan . He calls it " experimental and pioneering . " A white paper on its method of operating is published this week . Mr. Brooke plans to have Parliament approve the program soon after Easter and expects it to be in operation in the early summer . ' Panel to Decide Victims of violence prior to the operation of the program will not be able to claim compensation . Compensation will be paid in the form of a lump sum assessed by a panel of lawyers known as the Victims of Crimes of Violence Compensation Board . Payments will not be made for loss of property . Victims ( or their relatives ) of all forms of violence such as murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be eligible for compensation . The rate of compensation for loss of earnings is limited to twice the average of industrial earnings . In other words a business tycoon could not expect more than 4:35 a week ( about $100 ) fur loss of earnings . The initial annual cost of the program to the nation 's taxpayers is put at . Z I million to Z 1.5 million ( $2.8 million to $4.2 million ) . But because the plan is experimental this is only a rough estimate . Objections liaised A victim of violence who wins compensation is not prevented from suing the offender through the ordinary processes of law . But if further compensation is obtained in this way , the victim will be required to repay the state . Payments will be made under the state plan whether or not the offender has been brought to justice . But if criminal proceedings are pending , a decision on compensation will be delayed so as not to prejudice a trial . Some objections to this attitude are being voiced in Westminster and in the press . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come into operation without legislation ( because payments will be ex walla ) and that it is in any case only a pilot program . Another objcrtiun is that the state itself does not , under the new plan , undertake to bring actions against violent . criminals sitting on ill-gotten gains . But generally speaking this initial compensation plan is welcomed from all sides .
