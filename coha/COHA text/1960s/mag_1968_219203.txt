Hubert Humphrey bounces into the Oval Room of the White House , exuding more than his usual good spirits . " By golly , by gum , gee whillikers , do n't you look wonderful , Mr. President ! " Lyndon Johnson replies with his usual frankness : " All right , cut the crap , Hubie . I got somethin ' to tell ya . " Thus the President informs the Vice President that he does not intend to run for reelection , that the way is now open for a Humphrey candidacy . " Hello , Muriel Bird , " the Veep burbles into the phone five minutes later . " Have I got good news ! " <P> That at least is how the dramatic moment at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue was envisaged by Broadway Playwright Neil Simon ( The Odd Couple , Plaza Suite ) and Comedians Tony Randall and Larry Blyden , who performed the skit before 19,000 cheering Eugene McCarthy fans in New York City 's Madison Square Garden last week . As the star-fraught spectacular showed , politics this year has attracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other election have so many actors , singers , writers , poets , artists , professional athletes and assorted other celebrities signed up , given out and turned on for the candidates . <P> Dividing Equity . Eugene McCarthy and Robert Kennedy have , in fact , just about divided Actors ' Equity between them ( see box ) . There have been some notable crossovers . Gene has lured Rob ert Vaughn ( The Man from U.N.C.L.E. ) from touch-football games at Hickory Hill , while Bobby has corralled Carol Channing , who warbled her way into the White House with Hello , Lyndon ! in 1964 . Artists , writers and other intellectuals are also pretty evenly divided between the two . Bobby has a corner on famed athletes . With just the names he has now , he would probably sweep both the World Series and the football Super Bowl-though he might have trouble in the National Basketball playoffs . <P> If Beautiful People had their way , no one but McCarthy and Kennedy would be in the race . Though the Sinatras-Frank and Nancy-have for reasons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President 's supporting cast is far shorter and markedly less sexy . H.H.H. 's leading B.P. : Tallulah Bankhead , Roberta Peters , Sarah Vaughan , Jack Dempsey , Joseph Wood Krutch , Isaac Stern , John Steinbeck , Ralph Ellison and James T. Farrell . Couturiere Mollie Parnis is on the list - though of course Muriel makes almost all of her own clothes . <P> Richard Nixon 's celebrity roster is also brief-but heterogeneously charming . Its stars include Ray Bolger , John Wayne , Bart Starr , Ginger Rogers , Joe Louis and Rudy Vallee , who adjudges Nixon " the most qualified man in this country , intellectually and emotionally . " Oddly , none of Ronald Reagan 's former Hollywood colleagues have yet agreed in public that the Governor should move from Sacramento to Washington . To date , the only Beautiful Person who has declared for Nelson Rockefeller is Happy . <P> Simon for President . Does it really matter what the Beautiful People think ? Yes , in a way . McCarthy might have brought many people to Madison Square Garden all by himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smash : the $300,000 take provided more than a third of the entire budget for his California campaign .
