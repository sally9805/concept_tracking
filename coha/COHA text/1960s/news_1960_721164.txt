txt This is about the time Eleventh one begins to envy an Hour those persons who have Is Here filled out and mailed ' their Federal ? income tax returns for 1959 . They , are the same who do their Christmas shopping in October , or even September . Who have all their Christmas cards in sealed envelopes , stamped and addressed by Dec. 1 . Who keep little books in which birthdays and anniversaries of relatives and friends are carefully kept . Now these persons are making scale : drawings of their garden plots , or are reading informative books , or going to lectures , or watching educational programs on television while ' one ? is trying frantically to give some or- , der to little bunches of last year 's ' canceled checks , out of sequence , and to locate some of last year 's , receipted bills . This is also a time , Question : for asking unpleas Why ant questions , such So Tardy ? as : Why did not one return a completed tax form in January when certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitled to them  --  already have received refunds which they have put into savings accounts instead of paying overdue bills or buying something frivolous ? There is no answer to this . Perhaps one secretly hoped ? even knowing better  --  that somehow the income tax , like winter , would simply go away . Or that by putting off the depressing task until the eleventh hour one would , for once , remember those allowable deductions which in past years one has recalled shortly after dropping the smudged return into the mail-box . Another question : The . Word Why was one so stinfor 1960 : gy in 1959 ? At the Give ! year 's end one had the impression that it had been a year of generous benefactions to church , alma mater and to many societies and organizations for doing good . This philanthropic glow lasted only until the church financial secretary rendered an accounting and until one had ' combed through those canceled checks . It is clear that in this year 1960 one needs to give much , much more . ?  - -  The figure one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sorry Deductions reminder that one has been among a certain bank 's most loyal and most improvident customers , and one makes note  --  as one did last year ? I to do something about this . Saving is so much better than borrowing ? as even banks , these days , seeking to increase their , deposits , remind ( Me : Those " Medical and Dental Expense " items suggest another question : Why the rank injustice in the allowable deductions for " Cost of medicine and drugs " ? One may deduct for them only an amount in excess of 1 per cent of line 11 , page 1 of Form 1040 ? which shows adjusted gross income  --  but one may deduct the difference between one 's medical and dental expenses and 3 per cent of one 's adjusted gross income . The dollars spent for medicines and drugs are just as real and hard to come by as the dollars paid to dentists , surgeons , general practioners , pediatricians , internists and hospitals . One makes note to write to one 's Congressman about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still another question : Where Why does not one seem Others to have the generous Succeed " Other Deductions " certain other people are always speaking about so brightly ? those people who toil mightily ( they say ) at home in their spare time and as a result turn in ( they say ) large figures representing heat and light used while they are working , figures which ( they say ) help them to obtain refunds large enough to permit them to go to Florida for a week or two ? One must look into this , next year . But at last it is all Awaiting done , with row on a Generous row of double-checked Refund figures , probably wrong , and 1040 and attachments are duly signed by the taxpayer and the housewife whose knowledge of the economics of taxation can best be described as preglacial . One expects to get a genet .. ous refund of three dollars and for . ty-two cents  --  enough for a little pipe tobacco , a few stamps , and per . haps even a typewriter ribbon with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name is sc elusive .
