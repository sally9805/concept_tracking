txt Mississippi ? " We 're seeing a tremendous awakening taking place on the part of white politicians and city and state officials . They 're beginning to realize they must represent all the people , both Negroes and whites . " Alabama ? " The white leadership here has taken a new direction . They have a new strategy . It 's a smooth , soft-sell approach aimed at establishing tokenism . The whites do n't meet us with direct hostility any more . Just the fact that we can sit down and talk over problems is a sign of progress . " Louisiana ? " Generally speaking , 1966 was the worst year we 've had in the South in the past decade . We 've had a few spots in Louisiana where we 've made accomplishments . Some footholds were gained in parishes counties where Negroes were elected to local offices . " Georgia ? " This was the year of the ' slow undoing . ' For the past few years we 've had slow but steady progress . But 1966 was a slowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in politics , in national reactions , and in legislation . " These comments by civil-rights leaders point out some gradual changes that began taking place in race relations in 1966 and are likely to continue in 1967 . Most changes thus far have been in atti- . Ludes , rather than actions . Both the attitudes of whites and Negroes appear to be in transformation . Close observers of the South 's race relations say Negroes are becoming more militant , more aroused and concerned over their lingering problems , and less patient in waiting for solutions . The controversial " black power " doctrine that came into prominence in 1966 is said to be spreading both in the slums and in middle-income neighborhoods . Even the relatively moderate National Association for the Ad* // * Transformation seen in racial attitudes // vancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) has a number of " young Turks " among its members calling for more militancy . Civil-rights leaders , however , differ in their estimates of the effectiveness of the doctrine . In Birmingham , Dr. John W. Nixon , Alabama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement " a slap in the face " to the civil-rights efforts in his state . Serious blow seen " The slogan itself is exciting , " he explained , " but it 's been already proved it just does n't work . It is confusing some of our people . It has definitely damaged our movement , our cause . We 're just too tied in with our white brothers . We always have been since the beginning of society . It black power is frightening a lot of Negro people out of the fight . " Dr. Nixon added , " Our major setback in 1966 was that we lost a number of our white friends because of the black-power movement . That was the most serious blow to the movement this last year . " In Jackson , Miss. , however , the Rev. Allen L. Johnson , a state NAACP leader , feels the militant young movement aided the civil-rights cause in his state . " I think they black power advocates made white people appreciate the NAACP . They 've suddenly become warm to us and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lesser of two evils . " In Atlanta , the Rev. Ralph Abernathy , a Southern Christian Leadership Conference ( SCLC ) leader , commented , " Negroes are becoming aroused and concerned , but they will follow the course of nonviolence . " Although not an advocate of " black power " himself , the SCLC leader says he feels the term and the " frustrations that have brought about these antiwhite feelings " need to be understood . " Our job is to remove the problems that produced these feelings , " he said . Accomplishments minimized In New Orleans , Ike Reynolds , director of the Southern regional office of the Congress of Racial Equality ( CORE ) , expressed encouragement at the prospects for 1967 " because Negroes are beginning to recognize that they do n't have to depend on whites . They realize they can do things for themselves . " Mr. Reynolds , however , says 1966 was a year of few accomplishments by Negroes in their drive for racial equality . Asked why the civil-rights movement seemed to slow down , he replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil-rights bills in 1964 and 1965 and by the antipoverty program . The poverty program was sugar-coated and supposed to offer us so much . But neither of the federal acts produced what it was supposed to . The poverty program was just a gimmick to appease the Negroes . It has n't operated the way it should have . It was never adequately financed and only touched a small portion of the people it should have reached . Evidences of impatience " But people realize this now . The poverty program has helped organize poor Negro people . They 've got these people angry now , For years Negroes depended on the goodness of white people , but it just never came about . Now we 're looking to ourselves . We realize no one is going to do anything for us . We 've got to do it for ourselves . Black power is widely accepted , regardless of what the national news media report about it . " Paul Anthony , executive director of the Southern Regional Council , biracial human relations organization in Atlanta , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , noted that " on every economic and educational level , black nationalism or the antiwhite approach is growing . The feeling of disillusionment is going through the whole strata of Negro society : professors , teachers , lawyers , as well as slum dwellers . " What worries me , " he said , " is that we no longer have indications that Negroes are still as patient as they have been through the years . These rumblings in the slums are indications these people wo n't stand to be ignored any longer . " All southern civil-rights leaders surveyed by this reporter considered the huge turnout of Negro voters in 1966 elections as the most significant accomplishment of the civil-rights movement this past year . Following Southwide voter registration campaigns , Negroes in unprecedented numbers voted for the first time in 1966 . Also for the first time since Reconstruction a number of Negroes were elected to local and county offices in the South . Nearly all the Negro leaders contacted noted , too , that city and county officials are displaying a new willingness to discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have thus far come out of such discussions , but the willingness to communicate is considered a step in the right direction . Employment outlook Job opportunities are opening in limited numbers to Negroes in the South , according to the civil-rights leaders . Banks and other large firms are employing an increasing number of Negro cashiers and secretaries . Those benefiting from the new jobs are usually well-educated persons . To the massive numbers of uneducated , untrained Negroes in the South , better-paying jobs are still closed . The civil-rights leaders also complained that school desegregation is proceeding too slowly in the South and that " closed housing practices " are forcing more and more Negro families into substandard houses and growing slum areas .
