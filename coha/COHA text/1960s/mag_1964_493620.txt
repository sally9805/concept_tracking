The new British Prime Minister , Harold Wilson , came to Washington last week , exactly two years after Dean Acheson told West Pointers that Britain had lost an empire and was failing to find a new role by the side of the United States . President Johnson and Mr. Wilson seemed agreed that Britain does indeed have a role to play , in spite of Britain 's current financial frailty . In 1946 in a speech at Fulton , Missouri , Winston Churchill talked of a " special relationship " between the US and Britain , by which he meant that they should make joint use of all the naval and air force bases they both possessed all over the world . At that time , both countries had global responsibilities that no other country in the non-Communist world had , and they were also the only countries in the world that knew how to make atomic weapons . In the intervening period , Britain has suffered from economic debility , mainly the continuing consequence of the enormous debts incurred in six years of fighting the Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength by the enormous costliness of research and development of modern atomic and other weapons . The US for its part has lost its monopoly of the atomic bomb and has become still more committed in various parts of the world at the same time as Britain has to some extent abdicated as world policeman . All these aggravations have tended sometimes to make the " special relationship " a scratchy one . Yet by and large it is as true now as it was in 1946 that in the non-Communist world the US and Britain , and only the US and Britain , have responsibilities that extend from the Atlantic through the Indian into the Pacific Ocean . The French and the Dutch withdrew from the Far East , the Belgians from Africa ; Britain has 20,000 soldiers in Malaysia , large defense commitments to India and British soldiers recently rushed by invitation to East Africa to help sustain the new governments of Tanganyika and Kenya against army mutinies . The Germans , who have more gold and almost as many soldiers as the British , have for a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibilities whatever , though this might change if they were asked . But above all , the Americans and the British have a special relation because as well as sharing world responsibilities , and a world language , they usually have a common approach to problems . They both distrust ideologies and prize most highly a brand of pragmatism that the British like to call " muddling through " and the Americans call horse sense . It was apparently in this frame of mind that President Johnson and Harold Wilson sat down last week to talk things over ; the results seem to have been good . Britain used to have an empire " east of Suez . " It now has instead a tenuous formal connection with many large and small Afro-Asian countries that are members of " the Commonwealth . " If this were all , it would be almost as insignificant as Dean Acheson said it was when he dismissed " the Commonwealth " as having no political structure , unity or strength . One might go even further and compare " the Commonwealth " with the Holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empire . The Commonwealth substance lies not in formal ties but in a set of working relationships between Britain and the Afro-Asians . These relations tend to be highly pragmatic not sentimental ; and the current point of them is that they roughly correspond to the global responsibilities of both Britain and the US . Mr. Wilson hinted in Washington that Europe 's security problem is one of maintenance , Asia 's ( also Africa 's ) of provision . There is going to have to be Anglo-American cooperation regarding both Africa and Asia . And they will need the cooperation of African and Asian governments who soon must share ( though they may not yet admit it ) the altered attitude of the Indian government toward American and British aid in security . In practical terms the provision of security is going to entail the joint use of facilities that Britain now administers or controls , off the coasts of Africa and in the Indian Ocean ; or that Australia controls in the Pacific . That is very close to what Churchill proposed , when he first used the phrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . The term did not mean then , and does not now , that the US and Britain are in perfect accord about everything ; they probably do not see eye to eye about Vietnam , and certainly do not about China or Cuba . But the gap in viewpoints may be narrowing . The US now fully shares British anxieties about the Indonesian threat to Malaysia , and Britain intends withholding independence from British Guiana until satisfied that the different communities there can live in peace . The gap may also have narrowed as regards the security of Europe . The President and the Prime Minister have wisely put off for a time a decision about the multilateral nuclear force that threatened to divide them . With an eye to the possible composition of the next German government , Mr. Wilson has suggested that the whole alliance share in strategy-making concerning all the West 's nuclear weapons ; the German Socialists want this . Mr. Johnson seems neither to have bought this concept ? to which Congress would object ? nor stubbornly insisted on an unmodified MLF ? which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , whatever its ultimate form , any allied nuclear force should be under permanent USveto , which ought to please both President and Congress , if not all Germans and , still less , one Frenchman . Thus in nuclear matters , the British despite being themselves a nuclear power ( and a much stronger one than either France or China ) are not asking for a special relationship with the U5 ; what they are asking in this field is that they and all the European allies of the US ( as members of NATO ) take part in nuclear policy-making , while accepting that the last decision must , for purely practical reasons , be in the hands of the United States . There has recently been American talk that this final US word is something the Germans may in the long run refuse to put up with ; and this in turn led to devious hints about ultimate American approval of an independent European nuclear force . By muttering such hints , Washington appeared to be seeking clumsily to fool both the Germans ( by promising what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( by assuring them it would n't give it ) . It would be nice to think the Wilson visit has put an end to that foolishness , and to MLFinspired talk about Germany replacing Britain as the chief European ally of the United States . Nothing would make the Russians and Eastern Europeans more intransigent ; whereas what the British are seeking for Europe is the kind of defense that will make it possible to negotiate disarmament with Russia , which is surely as much in Germany 's interests as in everyone else 's , including ours . Where Are the Poor ? One of the Administration 's priority bills is the $1 billion Appalachian Regional Development Act that the Senate passed in September but the House did not act on . The program to develop an 11-state region will benefit more than 15 million people . No one doubts that Appalachian poverty is a serious national problem . However , there is even more poverty in the Deep South . This can be tested , by comparing median family income in Appalachia with median family income in the four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolina , Arkansas and Mississippi , in order of deepening poverty . Tennessee , in Appalachia , has more income per family than any of the four Deep South states . The median family income in Tennessee is $3,949 a year ; this is just $12 more than Alabama ( the least poor of the four Deep South states ) and $1 , o65 more than Mississippi . An average Tennesseean is $765 a year richer than an average Arkansan . If county income is compared , instead of statewide income , the disparity is less but the four Deep South states are still behind the Appalachian states . And the same applies if only the poorest county in each state is made the basis for comparison . Median family income in the poorest county of Tennessee is $1,363 , and in Mississippi is $1,260 . In Pennsylvania , another Appalachian State , median family income in the poorest county is $3,857 ; in Alabama , least poor of the four Deep South states , median family income in the poorest county is $1,387 . Most of the poorest counties in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : they are about 58 percent Negro . Perhaps for this reason , Congressmen from the Deep South may not be particularly interested in providing a poverty program there . Medicine in Missouri It has taken five years for Dr. Harold Will Lischner , a graduate of the University of Chicago Medical School and a diplomate of the American Board of Pediatrics , to get a license to practice medicine in Missouri , apparently because Dr. Lischner is a pacifist and was a conscientious objector in World War II , when he was zo . The Missouri State Board of Registration of the Healing Arts refused to license him on grounds of moral character . Finally , Cole County Circuit Judge Sam C. Blair upheld Dr. Lischner and returned the case to the board so that it could reverse its original decision . The judge ruled the board had been arbitrary in its grounds for denying Dr. Lischner the right to practice . The board said December 3 that it will not appeal the case further and will issue a license to Dr. Lischner . What the board was interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lischner 's political and religious beliefs , and his dislike of American Medical Association policies . The board wanted to know if he had ever set foot in Communist territory while he was working for a Quaker health and social welfare organization in Korea . It asked him if he was a Communist , if he considered himself a loyal American , had he ever carried a sign , did he believe in duly constituted authority , and what were the things about the AMA that he disliked . Dr. Lischner , who is licensed in Pennsylvania and California , testified that he is not a Communist , believes wholly in the Constitution , and thinks the AMA is wrong to oppose medicare and to allow segregation within local groups . Secretary of State Warren E. Hearnes , who won the Democratic nomination for Governor and is the new Governor-elect , had said the board 's original decision represented " a step toward thought control and a threat to the individual freedom of every American , every Missourian . " His defeated opponent , Lieutenant Governor Hilary Bush , had supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The former At-torney General , Thomas F. Eagleton , now Lieutenant Governor , had told the board in advance that he would not represent it in court . Interracial Cohabitation In February , 1962 the Miami , Florida , police arrested Connie Hoffman , a white waitress from Alabama , and Dewey McLaughlin , a Negro hotel employee ( a native of British Honduras ) , who were living together in a Miami Beach efficiency apartment . They were charged with and convicted for violating a Florida law which prohibited interracial cohabitation , and sentenced to 3o days in jail and a $5o fine . The statute prohibited interracial couples " not married to each other " from habitually living in and occupying " in the nighttime the same room . " Proof of sexual intercourse was not an element of their offense . The exact same conduct by a couple of the same race would not have been a crime under Florida law . These defendants could not plead a defense based on a common-law marriage because Florida also has a miscegenation law . The Supreme Court now has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed on December 7 that the statute sanctioned an arbitrary and invidious discrimination between classes of people . In the words of Associate Justice Byron White , the law was " . . . invalid as a denial of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment . on this basis we set aside these convictions .. . the central purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to eliminate racial discrimination emanating from official sources in the states . " Though the case at hand was pregnant with implications of the miscegenation issue , Justice White was careful to note that the majority reversed " . . . without expressing any views about the state 's prohibition of interracial marriage . " Nevertheless , there is language in the Court 's opinions which suggests a view against the existing 19 state miscegenation laws . The majority noted in passing that Florida rationalized its interracial cohabitation law on the ground that it was ancillary to and served the same purpose as its miscegenation law , and Justice Stewart wrote an impassioned concurring opinion , stating " . . . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution for a state law which makes the color of a person 's skin the test of whether his conduct is a criminal offense . These defendants were convicted .. . only because they were of different races . And I think it is simply not possible for a state law to be valid under our Constitution which makes the criminality of an act dependent upon the race of the actor . Discrimination of that kind is invidious per se " our italics . Justice Douglas agreed .
