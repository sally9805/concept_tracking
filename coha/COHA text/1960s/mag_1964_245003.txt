Spurred on by white mercenaries , Moise Tshombe 's reinvigorated army drove hard against the Congolese rebels . Loading their equipment aboard an ancient river steamboat , two commando units pulled out of their staging area at Kindu , crossed the Lualaba River , and , in 35 U.S. Army trucks , five Swedish troop carriers and four British armored cars , began their 350-mile march up the rutted rain-forest road to the rebel capital of Stanleyville . E.T.A . hopefully announced by Congolese Army Commander Joseph Mobutu : some time this week . <P> <P> But victory might come high . As the week wore on , desperate rebel " President " Christophe Gbenye made the price look stiffer and stiffer . <P> All-Fronts Alarm . Since September , after the war began to turn against them , the rebels had been holding a U.S. medical missionary , Dr. Paul Carlson , 36 , on absurd charges that he was " an American spy and an American major . " Carlson , member of the Evangelical Covenant Church of America , had seen military service only as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He voluntarily stayed behind rebel lines to minister to their wounded , living in a village of 50 inhabitants called , in the native dialect , " The End of the World . " But Gbenye announced that Carlson had been " tried " as a spy and sentenced to death . The missionary and the rebels ' other white prisoners-60 Americans and 800 Belgians-would be released only after the U.S. and Belgium withdrew all aid to Tshombe 's army . Last week Radio Stanleyville reported that Carlson 's execution had been delayed in order to negotiate his release and the fate of the other prisoners directly with Washington . The rebels obviously wanted to gain time to get more outside help , presumably from their Red Chinese backers . <P> <P> The U.S. agreed to " discuss " the prisoners ' release , at the same time warning that the rebels would be held " directly and personally responsible " for the safety of all foreigners in their area . But the U.S. could not even find anyone from the Stanleyville regime with whom to negotiate . Meantime , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Working through Arab and African nations , they piled diplomatic pressure on the Gbenye regime to release the hostages . U.N . Secretary-General U Thant appealed in vain for a mercy mission to Stanleyville . The Belgian government got Premier Moise Tshombe to offer the rebels a halfhearted amnesty . <P> 860 Would Die . There was always the chance that the rebels were bluffing . But a battalion of 600 crack Belgian paratroopers was loaded aboard U.S. C-130 turboprop transports at Belgium 's Diest airbase , flown to a little-used U.S. military base on Ascension Island , a British outpost in the South Atlantic only six air hours from Stanleyville . If necessary for humanitarian reasons , the Belgian government later announced , the paratroopers would be dropped on Stanleyville . <P> That got Moscow back into the act , after a long Russian silence on the Congo , with a demand that " all foreign interference be ended at once . " As for Gbenye , spouting fury he ordered the evacuation of all hostages from Stanleyville . Each hostage , he announced , had been turned over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city , all 860 would die .
