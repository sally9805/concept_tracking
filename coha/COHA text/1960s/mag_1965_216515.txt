Detroit 's biggest outdoor signboard is devoted , fittingly , to keeping a minute-by-minute tally of the year 's auto production . Sometime this week , the sign 's revolving numerals will register their 2,290,000th car in 1965 , thus breaking an alltime quarterly record for the auto industry ; before the month is out , that figure will rise to some 2,500,000 for 1965 's first three months .

Chrysler 's road to success was paved with gradually improving styling and quality in the company 's 1962 , ' 63 and ' 64 models . This year , for the first time since he was appointed in 1961 , Chrysler President Lynn Townsend has a car that he can call completely his own ; he has finally been able to rid the entire Chrysler line of the last traces of the garish fins and ornamentation that he inherited from L. L. ( " Tex " ) Colbert . Chrysler 's cars are also being pushed by a revitalized dealer organization , which increased from 6,000 to 6,300 dealerships last year .

Townsend himself set a personal record , improving his 1963 salary and bonus of $423,567 to $555,900 last year .
