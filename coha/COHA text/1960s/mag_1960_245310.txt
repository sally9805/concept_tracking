Old boxers never dive ; they just fade away into legitimate businesses . Last week James Joseph ( " Gene " ) Tunney , 62 , world heavyweight champion from 1926 until he retired as an undefeated millionaire in 1928 , was elected a director of Alleghany Corp. , which is presumably strengthening its corner for a proxy fight with Texas ' hard-swinging Murchison brothers ( TIME , Oct. 3 ) . In another corner , Rocky ( Somebody Up There Likes Me ) Graziano , 38 , middleweight champion of a decade ago , was named president of a Long Island bowling center owned by New York 's Acme Missiles &; Construction Corp . <P> <P> Apparently convinced that the French army will keep on trying to make a soldier of Yves Saint-Laurent for his full 27-month stint as a draftee , the House of Dior last week named his replacement as the world 's most publicized fashion designer : Marc Bohan , 34 , in charge of Dior 's successful London operation in the past two years . In contrast to Saint-Laurent 's extreme , erratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lofty Dior post-is notable for designing clothes that consistently prove their wearers have bosoms and waists . The job is Bohan 's until Saint-Laurent leaves the army , perhaps longer . <P> <P> After going official rounds in Washington , including a state reception at the White House , Japan 's Crown Prince Akihito and Princess Michiko fell into a vacation mood and headed for Manhattan . From a City Hall welcome , Akihito , a noted ichthyophile , dashed a block away to a commercial aquarium-stock store , purchased some rare breeds of fish ( imported to await his arrival ) and arranged for them to be aboard his chartered plane when he flies back fo Tokyo this week . It was not on the crown prince 's official schedule , but he was anxious to say hello to an old acquaintance , General of the Army Douglas MacArthur , who lives in Manhattan 's Waldorf Towers , only two floors away from the suite assigned to the royal couple . <P> <P> Near the French Riviera town of Menton , a photographer approached a pretty , sex-hexed celebrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in peace , " was the reply . " I 'm going to die anyway . " A few hours later , Brigrrte Bardot made an apparently serious-and heavily headlined - attempt to die . In the garden of a friend 's pink villa , a vineyard keeper found Brigitte unconscious beside a well . In the beam of his flashlight he saw Brigitte : " Her eyes were closed , her teeth slightly parted , and her arms were red with blood . " It was her 26th birthday-and it ended up in a neurological clinic in Nice , where the diagnosis was barbiturate poisoning , plus slight wrist lacerations . Brigitte 's periodically estranged husband , Cinemactor Jacques Charrier , far off on the other side of Southern France , in Biarritz , where he had gone after their latest spat , jumped in a car to drive to her side . At week 's end the aging " Sex Kitten " of French moviedom was recovering . Paris ' deadly serious Le Monde , customarily oblivious to BB , accorded her a sort of ghoulish obituary-in-life : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness only in glory . She had glory beyond all expectations . Even her name vanished and remained only as two initials : BB . Glory devoured everything : private life , peace , human personality-real or imagined .
