A four-engined Douglas DC-7 skimmed at 140 m.p.h. across the desert sands near Phoenix , Ariz. , clipped a pile of railroad ties that sheared off its propellers and landing gear . Next , the left wing smashed into a 25-ft. mound of dirt . Then the right slammed into three poles , which sliced off its tip . The fuselage hurtled onward , hopscotched over a 55-ft. hill , skidded to a shattering stop and burst into flames . Tense U.S. aviation experts broke into grins of delight ; rarely had they witnessed such constructive destruction . <P> The spectacular crack-up was the most significant crash safety test in the history of U.S. civil aviation . Financed by the Federal Aviation Agency at a cost of $168,000 , the project was planned by private aircraft companies , commercial airlines and the National Aeronautics and Space Agency . Its aim : to test new passenger safety devices and to analyze the pattern of structural damage wrought by such an impact . <P> Chesty Manikins . Actually , the plane , which moved under its own power with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed than expected , careened far past the anticipated wreck site . The fire , too , was not anticipated , since the DC-7 's main fuel tanks were filled with colored water to trace the post-crash distribution of inflammable fuel . An auxiliary tank carried only enough fuel for the short test run but resulted in the fire , which was quickly doused . <P> Main concern of the researchers as they raced to the wreckage was the fate of steel-framed , rubberized manikins strapped to seats inside the plane . To record the stress of impact , a dozen of them had a chestful of sensitive equipment . It will take months to analyze these data , but researchers were pleased to find that most of these " passengers " came through well enough to indicate a good chance of survival . <P> A major survival aid proved to be a new plastic air bag tucked into the rear of one seat ; inflated before impact , it spread backward in two sections-one over the feet and legs of the dummy in the seat behind , the other over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injury . Such bags , which can be inflated by a switch in the pilot 's compartment when a crash seems probable , are the first devices for individual passenger safety under serious consideration by the industry since the safety belt . <P> Better Crashes . On the negative side , three rear-facing seats failed to protect their manikins because the backs of the seats snapped and the " bodies " slipped out from under their seat belts . The protective qualities of one side-facing seat could not be determined because the seat belt broke . As for the " pilot " and " copilot , " who were given no special protection , investigators reluctantly concluded that they would have been crushed to death . <P> The metals and alloys of the ten-year-old plane , which the FAA bought for only $29,000 , will also have to be examined to determine their resistance to the stresses . <P> In June , a Lockheed Constellation with dummy passengers aboard will be similarly crashed . Such bigger and better crackups , air safety experts are convinced , will prove giant strides not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward allowing them to walk away from a wreck .
