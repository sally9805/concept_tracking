IT was an extraordinary scene . There , in Chancellor Kurt Kiesinger 's antique-filled office in Bonn , sat Soviet Ambassador Semyon ( " Scratchy " ) Tsarapkin . Painstakingly , the Russian explained Moscow 's grave concern over the first China border clash early this month to the head of a government long reviled by the Soviets as the chief villain and menace in Europe . Patiently , the German listened as Tsarapkin charged that the " chauvinist foreign policy of Peking " threatened the cause of peace and stability in the world . <P> It was probably the first time that any Soviet envoy had so formally attacked the policies of the other Communist giant . Behind Tsarapkin 's words was a warning : any further tightening of the profitable West German-Chinese trade links would be most unwelcome to the Russians . In Paris , Rome and Tokyo , Tsarapkin 's colleagues were giving the French , Italian and Japanese Foreign Ministers roughly the same message . In Ottawa , Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau also got the word . The intent was clear : China , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foe , should be expelled from the ranks of civilized nations . <P> Blood on the Border . Within the Communist world , the Soviet campaign was even more aggressive . A joint Soviet-Czech communique " emphatically condemned the recent provocative actions of the Chinese splitters , which inflict serious damage on the forces of socialism . " Pravda , organ of the Soviet Communist Party , noted that Mao Tse-tung and his clique had revealed " once more the extent of their political degradation , " and the Soviet press continued to bare details of the bloody Ussuri River border clash in the Far East , which , the Russians claim , cost the lives of 31 Russian frontier guards . <P> Far more serious were charges in the authoritative magazine Kommunist to the effect that today the military controls China and excludes the " broad masses of the working people " from any effective role . " The group of Mao Tse-tung , " said Kommunist , " has deserted Marxist-Leninist principles . " Translated from the jargon , that means that Moscow has read Peking out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other Communist parties to agree to ratify that decision at the forthcoming international party conference in May , and the Chinese are sure to be discussed at this week 's Warsaw Pact summit meeting . <P> Iron Fists in Action . Communist China 's ideological warriors responded to the Soviet attacks in kind . On four successive days , formal Chinese statements and protest notes whistled out of Peking , and the angry mass demonstrations against the " new czars " resumed across the China mainland . Peking 's most serious protest charged that there had been six other Soviet border transgressions on Chen Pao Island , site of the Ussuri fighting . At least two of these , China asserted , involved trucks and armored vehicles . The New China News Agency warned Moscow that " hundreds of millions of army men and civilians are on the alert . If you have the audacity to continue attacking China , you will be crushed to pieces by the iron fists of the 700 million Chinese people . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
