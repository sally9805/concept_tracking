It seemed at first a pedestrian case ambling toward a predictable conclusion . An obscure physician from Brooklyn , drafted into the Army and clearly a military misfit , was haled before a general court-martial , charged with preaching antiwar dogma to enlisted men and refusing to teach them dermatology as he had been ordered . But last week the case of Captain Howard Levy took on unexpected significance both as a precedent in military law and as a chapter in the worldwide debate over the Vietnamese war . For the first time in a U.S. military court , the war-crimes doctrine of Nrnberg was allowed as a defense strategy ; those who charge the U.S. with heinous atrocities were invited to put up evidence . <P> Colonel Earl Brown , the law officer , or presiding official , at the Fort Jackson , S.C. , trial , observed matter-of-factly : " My research discloses the Nrnberg trials involve a rule that a soldier must refuse an order to commit war crimes . " If it can be shown that by obeying the order Levy was abetting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against him would be dropped . The defense , led by Charles Morgan Jr. , southeastern regional director of the American Civil Liberties Union , was so astonished at the ruling that war-crimes evidence would be heard that it had none to offer immediately . Instead Morgan won a recess until this week and called on antiwar propagandists to volunteer proof of his statement : " I think we can prove there is a policy of eradication of the Vietnamese people who wo n't support our side . " <P> Lack of WACs . Morgan sounded as extreme as his client . According to the charges against Levy and the testimony of some of the 27 prosecution witnesses , the doctor told GIs that he would refuse to go to Viet Nam if ordered , that Negro soldiers especially should refuse to fight there , that Lyndon Johnson was like Adolf Hitler and that Special Forces men-whom he was ordered to instruct- " are liars and thieves and killers of peasants and murderers of women and children . " To teach the Green Berets how to treat skin diseases of Vietnamese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profession . Therefore he defied the order . <P> To this the defense offered no factual opposition . Morgan argued that the case should be thrown out on a variety of grounds , ranging from constitutional guarantees of free speech to the fact that WACs are excluded from court-martial panels . " It is the right , indeed the duty , " said Morgan , " of all Americans to think , to dream and to talk . " However , the most serious charge against Levy is that he refused to carry out a direct order given in writing .
