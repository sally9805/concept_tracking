Aided by the Alliance for Progress and a strong infusion of private investment , Central America 's five nations are enjoying unprecedented economic prosperity ( TIME , Jan. 1 ) . Politically , El Salvador , Guatemala and Nicaragua seem headed toward more or less representative governments , and Costa Rica has become a model constitutional republic . But there is one unfortunate throwback to the old era of machine-gun politics when O.

In reality it was to legalize the strong-arm rule of Colonel Osvaldo Lpez , 44 , the ambitious air force officer who ousted President Ramn Villeda Morales in October 1963 . <P> Shortly before the election , the Nationalist Party supporting Lpez announced that if it won a majority of the 64 assembly seats , it would declare the colonel to be Honduras ' constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted the deposed Villeda Morales to return from exile in Costa Rica and run a full slate of Liberal Party candidates . That was largely window dressing . Opposition leaders complained that army troops went around arresting key Liberal organizers and lifting the identity cards of thousands of Liberal Party members . <P> On election day , the first returns showed such an embarrassingly heavy Nationalist landslide that the government stopped issuing hourly reports . When they were resumed , the race was much closer , with the Nationalists finally winning 35 seats to the Liberals ' 29 . The result coincided exactly with the predictions government officials gave foreign newsmen . Said one U.S. policymaker : " We did our best to push the colonel toward real elections .
