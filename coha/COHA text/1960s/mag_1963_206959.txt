The Atlantic and Gulf Coast dock strike was one of the longest and costliest in U.S. maritime history . It left 100,000 workers idle , including 62,000 striking longshoremen , cost $700 million and created dislocations , small or large , in almost every industry in the nation . Last week , after 33 days , the strike ended-but the settlement caused almost as much commotion and concern as the strike itself . <P> " Take It or Leave It . " What disturbed the shippers , and some other businessmen too , was the heavy hand of Government in the final settlement . They fear that the settlement may form a pattern for several other major contract negotiations coming up later . Intervening in strikes , and often with success , has been the practice of the Kennedy Administration , which obviously felt a duty to try to settle a prolonged strike that threatened large areas of the economy . <P> In the past , though , the Administration 's role has largely been that of friendly mediator , suggesting solutions and helping two dissident parties inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taft-Hartley injunction nor a platoon of regular federal mediators did any good . So Kennedy named a three-man mediation board , headed by labor-leaning Senator Wayne Morse of Oregon , and threatened the strikers and shippers with congressional intervention if they did not go along with the final terms of the board . It was practically compulsory arbitration . As Senator Morse put it : " Take it or leave it . " <P> Stiff Settlement . The board 's final terms tempted many shippers to leave it , and the key word in their acceptance was " reluctance . " Not only was the settlement stiff ; it was more than double the figure prescribed under the Administration 's price-wage " guidelines " that set the tone for last year 's noninflationary settlements in the steel and aluminum industries . Under these guideposts , any industry 's wages and fringe benefits should rise only as fast as industry 's overall productivity . <P> In the dock industry , where the longshoremen 's prestrike hourly base of $3.02 ( plus fringe benefits ) put their wages in the top 8% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 39-an-hour package increase over the next two years - 17 more than management offered , 11 less than labor asked . This is roughly a 5% to 6% increase a year , while industry 's productivity is increasing only 2% to 3% yearly and longshoreman productivity is actually declining . Meanwhile , the agreement did nothing about the featherbedding " work gang rules " that management claims are holding productivity down . This question was left to what promises to be a nearly endless series of study groups . Even with that victory , several locals dawdled about going back to work until word came from the Administration that President Kennedy was " fed up " with their recalcitrance . At week 's end the International Longshoremen 's Association ordered them to return to the docks .
