Scene : LORD PENGO 'S office  --  London , May , 1933 . A high-ceilinged room done in the style of the Brothers Adam . The furnishings and decorations are a collection of authentic antiques and paintings  --  mostly of the Italian schools . The woodwork is painted a soft white and the walls are finished in a striped paper overlayed with a meandering morning-glory motif in several shades of blue-gray . Center stage on an oval carpet is PENGO 'S desk and chair . In front of the desk is a small period stool . To the right of the desk is a small open armchair . At left is a door to the outer office and down from this door is an occasional chair . Leaning against the wall are two framed paintings with inventory tags attached . At the center of the back wall is a large window looking out onto the London street . To the left of this is a pedestal with a piece of sculpture on it . To the right is a wall table with a vase of flowers , over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the right wall is a concealed door to an inner hall . Downstage right is an easel with the Allendale Giorgione on it . There is a traveler rod and drapery over the painting , so that it may be covered . There are several other paintings on the walls and a chandelier hangs from the ceiling . At rise : FILBERT , LORD PENGO 'S factotum , is fussing with the Allendale which he has just brought in . FILBERT is very Cockney . He has been a steward on an English ship on which PENGO has made innumerable crossings . Liking his service , PENGO asked him one day whether he would care to leave the sea to become his valet . FILBERT left the sea . Latterly PENGO has permitted FILBERT to valet the pictures also . While FILBERT is making adjustments to the easel of the Allendale , DEREK PENGO , LORD PENGO 'S son , comes in . He is a charming , sensitive , diffident young Englishman of twenty-four . DEREK PENGO Ah , Filbert . What 's the Giorgione doing in here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it placed in ' ere , Mr. Derek , as ' e is expectin ' Mr. Drury to come to ' ave a look at it . DEREK PENGO Oh , Drury 's coming , is he ? FILBERT Yes , Mr. Derek . ' E ' as an appointment . May I ask what this is , Mr. Derek ? DEREK PENGO It is a very famous picture , Filbert . The Adoration of the Shepherds . Do you like it ? FILBERT ( With a casual glance at the picture ) Oh , it 's fetchin ' , Mr. Derek . No doubt about that . DEREK PENGO Well , Filbert , how do you like the new life my father has provided for you ? FILBERT When I was steward on the Berengaria I weyted on your father many crossings . ' E 's a very kind and amiable gentleman , your father , except when ' e 's angry . DEREK PENGO ( Smiles at him sympathetically ) The exceptions are frequent , I 'm afraid ! FILBERT I 'd be quite ' appy ' ere if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ave difficulty masterin ' their names . They 're bitter , those names and when I mess ' em up your father boils over a bit This one ' ere for instance  --  ( He mops his perspiring brow ) ' E 's a tough one for sure . Jar  --  Jar  --  p. 4 DEREK PENGO Giorgione . FILBERT I ' ave tried . I ' ave studied . But it just wo n't roll off my tongue , Mr. Derek . DEREK PENGO Do n't worry , Filbert . My father sometimes forgets the names of the artists himself . To him they 're all Pengos . FILBERT Your father ' its the ceilin ' every time I I sometimes wish , Mr. Derek DEREK PENGO Yes , Filbert ? FILBERT ( Pleading desperately for a reasonable accommodation ) That your father would cheynge their names  --  could n't ' e just give ' em some good English names ? DEREK PENGO ( Delighted with this ) I 'll suggest it to him , Filbert ! ( LORD PENGO enters . He is a handsome , beautifully-dressed Englishman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiates energy and good will ; he gives the impression of a man who wants everybody around him to have as good a time as possible . He really takes an enormous interest in people and feels warmth toward them , except when crossed ; when that happens , his temper is uncontrollable and apoplectic ; he has , in fact , the high coloring of the apoplectic . He enjoys his own career , is conscious of giving a " good performance , " and would like it if other people got fun out of it , as he does himself . He has an infectious laugh which rings out whenever he is amused  --  not only by the foibles of others , but by his own ) p. 5 DEREK PENGO I 've just got a wonderful idea from Filbert , Father ! LORD PENGO That 's no surprise to me . Filbert is always very stimulating . ( To FILBERT ) Thank you , Filbert . FILBERT Thank you , my Lord . ( FILBERT goes out . DEREK is smiling ) LORD PENGO What are you laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LORD PENGO Sometimes I think I made a mistake when I took him off the sea . He was such a good steward . DEREK PENGO So Drury 's finally coming , is he ? LORD PENGO Yes . Took a lot of doing . He 's got it into his stubborn head that this Giorgione 's a Titian . DEREK PENGO What else is on the program for today ? LORD PENGO Walter Cannon Brink . The railroad king from San Francisco . DEREK PENGO What 's he after ? LORD PENGO He wants an English eighteenth-century portrait for his private Pullman car . DEREK PENGO Why ca n't he look at the scenery ? LORD PENGO Because it does n't cost anything ! p. 6 DEREK PENGO Is Primrose coming with Brink ? LORD PENGO Naturally  --  she wants to look at the chinoiserie . DEREK PENGO ( Teasing him ) We wo n't deny her that opportunity , will we , Father ? LORD PENGO ( Teasing back ) Of course not . I love Prim and have n't the heart to deny her anything ! By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build a house in New York . DEREK PENGO If you 've almost persuaded her she 's persuaded . LORD PENGO ( Enjoying laying out his strategy to DEREK ) As Walter Cannon Brink is crazy about her , I am going to suggest to him that he wants a house in New York too . DEREK PENGO Packed to the roof with the best Pengos . LORD PENGO What else ? DEREK PENGO Really , Father ! The way you mix up love with architecture ! LORD PENGO They harmonize , my boy Also , Derek , a detail DEREK PENGO Ah ! A detail ! LORD PENGO I have placed the Red Boy of Goya in the passage on the way to the Chinese Gallery . So be sure you take Prim through that way . I have a strong feeling  --  that Prim may want to adopt the Red Boy . p. 7 DEREK PENGO Busy afternoon ! Crowded with detail ! LORD PENGO ( Turns to the Allendale ) It 's all nothing , Derek  --  small change  --  compared to Drury and the Allendale . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get close to him . DEREK PENGO Who can ? He walked out on Prim . And Daphne , his own daughter , is afraid of him , ca n't talk to him . LORD PENGO He has a peculiar effect on me  --  makes me nervous  --  very nervous . ( Goes to the Allendale , contemplates it gloomily ) It 's going to be a tussle  --  a tremendous tussle  --  to sell him this Giorgione . DEREK PENGO Is n't Berenson a little doubtful that it is a Giorgione ? LORD PENGO ( Sharply ) Thirty years ago he said it was ! DEREK PENGO That 's a long time ago . LORD PENGO I think I can persuade Berenson to recover his original impulse . Now , Derek , help me to anticipate Drury 's objections , will you ? Let 's  --  practice ! Be Drury for a few minutes . DEREK PENGO Now , Dad ! If I could be Drury  --  with that vast fortune and that arctic exposure  --  do you think I 'd be working for an impulsive Hungarian like you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Derek . This is serious . Help me . DEREK PENGO All right . I 'll try . LORD PENGO ( Going into his act ) Sit down , Mr. Drury , so I can show it to you properly . DEREK PENGO ( He has seen DRURY . He now imitates that glacial , Olympian manner ) Thank you . LORD PENGO Now then  --  ( He takes his stance before the Allendale ) It is a question of this magnificent , unparalleled Giorgione . I own the greatest pictures in the world , Mr. Drury . This is the greatest picture I have ever owned . The fact is , Mr. Drury , I have been for three days  --  since this greatest of all masterpieces came into my possession  --  in a state bordering on exaltation . Have n't been able to eat or sleep ( Stops , annoyed with DEREK ) Well ! Why do n't you say something ? DEREK PENGO Because Drury never does . He knows that silence makes people uncomfortable . LORD PENGO ( Almost shouts ) Do n't overdo it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEREK PENGO Now , Father , do n't lose your temper with me . You might do it with Drury and that would be fatal . Try again . p. 9 LORD PENGO ( Swallows his pride , gets control of himself and goes again into his spiel ) Look at it , Mr. Drury  --  feast your eyes upon it  --  the Allendale Giorgione . It is not a painting merely . It is music . Colored music . DEREK PENGO That 's pretty . LORD PENGO Shut up ! You know that Giorgione died when he was thirty-two years old . There are not in the world ten pictures that are indisputably his own . This is one of them . DEREK PENGO ( Imitates DRURY 'S astringent tone ) When you say " indisputably , " you exaggerate . There is considerable dispute . No one in the world knows more about Italian pictures than Bernard Berenson . And Berenson says it is not a Giorgione but a Titian . LORD PENGO Yes , but before that  --  thirty years ago  --  Berenson pronounced it a Giorgione . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . LORD PENGO I assure you , my dear Mr. Drury , that Berenson will pronounce it a Giorgione . DEREK PENGO Do you add prophecy to your other accomplishments , Lord Pengo ? LORD PENGO ( Loses his temper , blurts out ) Drury would never say that ! p. 10 DEREK PENGO ( Defending his interpretation ) How do you know he would n't ? LORD PENGO ( Who knows that that is just what DRURY would say ) I just know ! DEREK PENGO Sorry . I 'm only improvising . LORD PENGO Try again . ( Gets a grip on himself and returns to the attack ) I assure you , my dear Mr. Drury , that Berenson will pronounce it a Giorgione . DEREK PENGO I shall wait for Berenson to change his mind . ( Turns to go ) Good morning , Lord Pengo . LORD PENGO ( Mutters ) That 's better ! DEREK PENGO ( Stops ) Assuming , Lord Pengo LORD PENGO Yes , Mr. Drury ? DEREK PENGO that this picture is by Giorgione  --  LORD PENGO Yes , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? LORD PENGO That 's a good question . This picture is unique . There is no other like it in the world . It is priceless . ( Smiles at DEREK ) You are businessman enough to know , my dear Mr. Drury , that no matter what you pay for the priceless , you are getting it cheap ! p. 11 DEREK PENGO ( His lips have silently mouthed his father 's words  --  he has heard them so often ) Well , there you are ! I 've given you a chance to use your favorite slogan . LORD PENGO It is not a slogan , Derek , it is a sound principle . It appeals to bargain-hunters . DEREK PENGO ( Laughs ) You are wonderful , Father . So  --  resilient ! LORD PENGO Well , what do you think , Derek ? Will Drury see the light ? DEREK PENGO ( More soberly ) Do n't ask me what I think , Dad . LORD PENGO ( Sharply ) Why not ? DEREK PENGO Because , one : my opinion is unimportant . Two : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I would n't act on it ! No doubt about it , when your mother bore you , she gave birth to a conscience . ( JOHNSON comes in . He is tall , bald , superb  --  an emperor in a frock coat and striped trousers ) JOHNSON Mrs. Drury , Mr. Walter Cannon Brink . Lady Winfield is waiting . She says she has an appointment . LORD PENGO Show Mrs. Drury and Mr. Brink in. p. 12 JOHNSON Yes , my Lord . ( JOHNSON goes ) LORD PENGO Derek , go to the reception room , will you , and chat with Lady Winfield for a bit ? DEREK PENGO Fine . LORD PENGO She 's a dear woman , unfortunately down on her luck , but I think I can do something for her . DEREK PENGO Well , if you think you can do something for her  --  she 'll soon be swimming in affluence ! ( He goes ) JOHNSON ( Returns ) Mrs. Enoch Drury and Mr. Walter Cannon Brink . ( JOHNSON goes out . MRS . ENOCH DRURY and MR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DRURY , between forty-five and fifty , was , in her girlhood , a stage beauty and is still lovely ; she is one of those women whose charm is perennial ; she will be enchanting when she is seventy . Incapable of affectation herself , she penetrates pretension in others through her natural acute sense of observation . At the same time she is incorrigibly romantic and wants to be loved and to be herself in love . WALTER CANNON BRINK , III , is a multimillionaire who has pulled himself up by virtue of an accidental association with men harder and more ruthless than himself  --  like ENOCH DRURY , for example , whose partner he once was . The gnawing envy and hatred of his life is DRURY , to whom he owes his eminence and who has made him aware of the debt . Outwardly , BRINK is a mild , timid little man of fifty , with the appearance of a store clerk who will never get a raise . When his visitors come in , they find PENGO in rapt contemplation of the Giorgione . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trance . He wheels to greet them ) p. 13 LORD PENGO My dear Primrose ! PRIMROSE DRURY Hello , Joe , how 's every little thing ? LORD PENGO Wally ! How are you ? WALTER CANNON BRINK , III Greetings ! LORD PENGO Delighted to see you Well , Wally ! Enjoying yourself ? WALTER CANNON BRINK , III That 's just what I 'm not . Ca n't wait to get on that boat and back to San Francisco ! LORD PENGO And with your darling Prim here ! Come now , Wally ! That 's not very gallant ! PRIMROSE DRURY With me , Wally 's on one subject all the time . Marriage . He 's got no what-you-might-call general conversation . WALTER CANNON BRINK , III I do n't know how many times I 've proposed to Prim , Joe . PRIMROSE DRURY At lunch today was number eight . LORD PENGO She keeps count , Wally . That should encourage you . PRIMROSE DRURY No such thing . I 've got other ideas and Wally knows it . WALTER CANNON BRINK , III Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faithful to a man who 's deserted her ? What do you make of that ? p. 14 PRIMROSE DRURY I 'm eccentric , Wally . Better make up your mind to that . ( Looking at the Allendale ) What 's this , Joe ? LORD PENGO ( He has been waiting for this ) The Allendale Giorgione . Greatest picture I ever owned ! PRIMROSE DRURY What are they all doing ? LORD PENGO It is called The Adoration of the Shepherds . PRIMROSE DRURY Where are the sheep ? LORD PENGO In another picture . Do you like sheep ? PRIMROSE DRURY I love sheep . LORD PENGO I 'll show you a picture with sheep . WALTER CANNON BRINK , III Do n't care for pictures of babies ! LORD PENGO Oh , but , my dear Wally , this baby ! WALTER CANNON BRINK , III How much ? LORD PENGO ( Has been waiting for this also ) Not for sale ! WALTER CANNON BRINK , III ( The picture becomes instantly desirable ; piqued and irritated ) Why not ? LORD PENGO ( As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ client . p. 15 WALTER CANNON BRINK , III ( Snarls ) I can guess who ! LORD PENGO ( Pleasantly ) Can you ? WALTER CANNON BRINK , III ( Hating every syllable of the name ) Enoch Drury . LORD PENGO Now , Wally , do n't pry  --  trade secret . WALTER CANNON BRINK , III He gets everything . PRIMROSE DRURY Everything but what makes him happy . WALTER CANNON BRINK , III ( Jealous ) He got you ! PRIMROSE DRURY He got me all right , but he did n't want to keep me . WALTER CANNON BRINK , III ( To PRIMROSE ) And you 're still bankering . You 're only here now because you know Drury 's coming . LORD PENGO How do you know that , Wally ? WALTER CANNON BRINK , III Because she told me and you told her ! LORD PENGO I told you that in confidence , Prim . PRIMROSE DRURY Sorry , Joe .

You have a beautiful collection . I showed you the Van Dyck in the National Gallery the other day , did n't I ? Now , the one I sold you is better . Did n't you see that it was better ? WALTER CANNON BRINK , III I would n't give up mine for half a dozen of the National Gallery 's . LORD PENGO ( Beams at him ) Well ! There you are ! ( DEREK comes back ) PRIMROSE DRURY Derek ! DEREK PENGO Prim ! LORD PENGO You know my son and heir , Derek Pengo . Mr. Walter Cannon Brink . ( BRINK and DEREK shake hands ) DEREK PENGO Excuse me , Dad .

WALTER CANNON BRINK , III On my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her **29;1215;TOOLONG by Hoppner which I mean to pry out of her for you . p. 17 WALTER CANNON BRINK , III What are you going to soak me for her ? LORD PENGO Depends on Lady Winfield . She may turn out to be a sharp bargainer . But I think I can get it for you for a mere forty thousand . WALTER CANNON BRINK , III Dollars or pounds ? LORD PENGO Wally , be serious . Pounds . WALTER CANNON BRINK , III That 's a hell of a lot to pay for a great-grandmother . LORD PENGO Ah ! But in the portrait this great-grandmother is twenty years old and ravishingly beautiful . PRIMROSE DRURY Where 's the chin-wah-soree you were telling me about , Joe ? LORD PENGO Derek , show Primrose the chinoiserie . PRIMROSE DRURY Want you to show it to me , Joe . I wo n't believe it 's the real McCoy till you show it to me !

PRIMROSE DRURY I love looking at things with you , Derek , I do n't have to decide anything . ( To BRINK ) Do n't you want to see it , Wally ? p. 18 WALTER CANNON BRINK , III Want to talk to Joe a minute . LORD PENGO Certainly . ( To DEREK ) Provide some tea . PRIMROSE DRURY Tea ! I 've been drowning in tea since I got to London . Have n't you got some good hot Java ? LORD PENGO Derek , coffee . DEREK PENGO Certainly . ( PRIMROSE and DEREK go out ) WALTER CANNON BRINK , III Nice boy you got . LORD PENGO Best in the world . Gets out of hand here and there WALTER CANNON BRINK , III Same with my boy . Great disappointment . Drinks and wenches . LORD PENGO Oh , nothing like that with Derek . WALTER CANNON BRINK , III Prim tells me he 's got a crush on her daughter , Daphne . LORD PENGO Absolutely smitten . WALTER CANNON BRINK , III Daphne takes after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a soft baby . That 's my worry about Derek  --  soft baby . WALTER CANNON BRINK , III ( Lovelorn ) Awful sunk , Joe . p. 19 LORD PENGO Why ? WALTER CANNON BRINK , III Prim . LORD PENGO Plenty of fish in the sea , Wally , for a man of your resources . WALTER CANNON BRINK , III Prim is the fish I want . LORD PENGO Will you take my advice , Wally ? WALTER CANNON BRINK , III You 're the only one I can talk to , Joe . LORD PENGO ( His line of action taut ) How would you like to spend the weekend with me at Winthrop Castle ? Lord Shillinghurst 's . One of England 's most beautiful homes . WALTER CANNON BRINK , III But Prim is sailing ! LORD PENGO ( Airily ) Let her sail . WALTER CANNON BRINK , III I 'm lonely in Europe . Awful lonely . LORD PENGO But London is a marvelous city  --  so much to do here . WALTER CANNON BRINK , III Maybe for you  --  not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Joe . One night  --  couple of weeks ago  --  I got so blue and lonely I asked the manicure girl in the hotel what to do , where to go . LORD PENGO Did she tell you ? p. 20 WALTER CANNON BRINK , III She told me . LORD PENGO Did you take her ? WALTER CANNON BRINK , III I took her . LORD PENGO Did you enjoy it ? WALTER CANNON BRINK , III I did n't . She did n't . LORD PENGO Too bad . WALTER CANNON BRINK , III It 's a matter of pride with me , Joe . LORD PENGO What is ? WALTER CANNON BRINK , III Not to get things  --  you know what I mean , Joe  --  for money . LORD PENGO Want to be loved for yourself alone . That it ? WALTER CANNON BRINK , III ( Happy to be understood ) That 's it ! That 's why  --  when I take out a girl like that  --  I do n't let ' em know I 'm a rich man . I act stingy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convincing . WALTER CANNON BRINK , III You see , Joe Ever since I was knee-high to a grasshopper I 've been in love with Prim . Ever tell you how I met her ? LORD PENGO Do n't believe you did . WALTER CANNON BRINK , III She was one of the Three Dandies. p. 21 LORD PENGO Was she ? Who were they ? WALTER CANNON BRINK , III Father and daughter act . Two sisters and their father . They danced . Saw them with Enoch Drury when they played Sacramento . LORD PENGO And you both fell in love with Primrose ? WALTER CANNON BRINK , III Enoch got her . I was stuck with the other two Dandies . LORD PENGO Oh , yes . I 'd heard you and Drury married sisters . WALTER CANNON BRINK , III I did n't like the sister much but I married her anyway . Because Prim wanted me to . After she died and Prim and Drury got separated , I thought sure Prim would marry me . But she wo n't . LORD PENGO Be guided by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and come with me to Winthrop Castle . I 'll see that Lady Shillinghurst invites some attractive women down . WALTER CANNON BRINK , III ( In a panic ) Do n't do that , Joe . Please ! LORD PENGO Why not ? WALTER CANNON BRINK , III I know those kind of women . They scare me . Any minute they 're liable to break into French . I do n't even understand their English . LORD PENGO All right . Nobody there but you and me . In two weeks we 'll sail to New York together . p. 22 WALTER CANNON BRINK , III That 'll be wonderful , Joe . Gosh , you 're a real friend . LORD PENGO ( Demonstrating his friendship ) Why do n't you leave San Francisco , Wally ? Why do n't you build a house in New York ? WALTER CANNON BRINK , III I like San Francisco . New York scares me almost as much as Europe does . LORD PENGO ( Casually ) Prim 's building a house in New York . WALTER CANNON BRINK , III @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ! LORD PENGO ( With an engaging smile at him ) I told her ! She 's tired of living in that gloomy hotel Drury gave her when he separated from her .

And , Johnson , get me Sir William Fitzpatrick on the phone . Urgent . ( JOHNSON goes out as PENGO walks BRINK to the door ) It 's settled then . You 're not sailing with Primrose . You 're waiting for me. p. 23 WALTER CANNON BRINK , III Can I count on you , Joe ? LORD PENGO Absolutely . WALTER CANNON BRINK , III ( With an excess of pride ) I 'll tell Prim . Maybe you 're right . She 's been counting on me too much . I 've been too steady . LORD PENGO That 's the spirit , Wally . ( BRINK goes out . The telephone rings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir William !

She is a fragile , shy , gray-haired British aristocrat , rather shabbily dressed . PENGO 'S manner to her is exquisitely courteous ) JOHNSON Lady Winfield ( JOHNSON disappears ) LORD PENGO My dear Lady Winfield , it is very good of you to come . LADY WINFIELD Thank you , Lord Pengo. p. 24 LORD PENGO Please sit down May I say , Lady Winfield , without beating about the bush , that I am madly in love with your **29;1246;TOOLONG !

LADY WINFIELD Yes , Lord Pengo . LORD PENGO ( Patiently ) Have you arrived at a figure ? LADY WINFIELD Yes , we have . As you yourself admit , Lord Pengo , it is a very fine Hoppner ( She simply can not bring herself to name the sum , which now seems staggering to her ) We thought therefore LORD PENGO The figure , Lady Winfield ? p. 25 LADY WINFIELD ( Shuts her eyes , holds on to the arms of the chair , leaps into the abyss ) Eighteen thousand pounds .

In agony , she starts to apologize ) You see we are in a most it is humiliating to but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , that is you expressed such enthusiasm for it my husband thought LORD PENGO Forgive me if I tell you , Lady Winfield , that I am quite shocked . LADY WINFIELD ( Starts to get up ) In that case , if you came to see us again and talked to my husband LORD PENGO ( Keeps her from getting up ) No , no , Lady Winfield please LADY WINFIELD My husband gets tired so easily . I wished to spare him . LORD PENGO Another interview will not be necessary . I have said that I am shocked , and I am . That you should consent to part with such an exquisite work of art ( His voice quivers at the betrayal ) for the paltry sum of eighteen thousand pounds ! ( He turns away to master his indignation ) p. 26 LADY WINFIELD ( Quite at sea ) I am afraid  --  that I do n't LORD PENGO The very least  --  the rock-bottom least  --  that you should sell a Hoppner of this quality for is twenty-five thousand pounds .

Brink 's private Pullman car . LADY WINFIELD ( Utterly bewildered ) I 'm afraid I do n't understand LORD PENGO Mr. Brink is president of a great railroad . He shuttles between New York , Palm Beach and Seattle in his private car . Your **29;1308;TOOLONG will see America as no Englishwoman has ever seen it before . LADY WINFIELD She 'll be so restless !

Good luck ( She goes . PENGO goes to the phone ) Put in a call to my office in New York . I want to talk to Miss Swanson . Make it for five o'clock . I 'll be back from the Lords by then . ( He hangs up . JOHNSON enters and announces WILFRED OLIVER , who comes in , then JOHNSON exits . OLIVER is a very attractive , somewhat epicene American , about thirty-five years old ) Well , my dear Wilfred , how are you ? WILFRED OLIVER Lovely to see you , Lord Pengo .

LORD PENGO How would you like to come back to work for me ? WILFRED OLIVER Well , to tide me over . But , as I made clear the last time I worked for you , my heart is in the theatre . LORD PENGO You should get a more responsive sweetheart , dear boy . Face the facts . You are good-looking , charming , you 've nice manners and a really extraordinary taste in furniture and decoration . That 's your true talent .

LORD PENGO There 'll be a charming fellow American on the Mauretania  --  Mrs. Enoch Drury . ( WILFRED is impressed . He emits a long , low whistle ) She used to be on the stage  --  bond between you . Also , she is thinking of building a house on Fifth Avenue p. 31 WILFRED OLIVER Oh ? LORD PENGO Which will , I hope , make another bond between you . I rely on you to furnish it , my boy , with the best Pengos , so that when I come to dine , I 'll feel perfectly at home ! ( He enjoys this conceit . He is in high fettle . He starts walking WILFRED out . He buzzes for JOHNSON ) You understand , my boy WILFRED OLIVER Yes ? LORD PENGO The connection , as before , will be unofficial . WILFRED OLIVER Quite . LORD PENGO Preferable that no one knows you are on my payroll . WILFRED OLIVER Quite . ( JOHNSON comes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson , take Mr. Oliver to the Chinese Gallery . JOHNSON Yes , my Lord . ( As he goes out with OLIVER in tow ) I thought you might be interested to know , my Lord LORD PENGO Yes , Johnson ? JOHNSON On her way to the Chinese Gallery , Mrs. Drury noticed the Red Boy of Goya . She fell madly in love with him . p. 32 LORD PENGO ( With a gleam ) Good . I encourage all love affairs that take place in my premises . ( He gives OLIVER a look which OLIVER understands . As JOHNSON and OLIVER leave , DEREK enters ) DEREK PENGO What 's Oliver doing around here ? LORD PENGO I have just rehired him . He 's working for us again . ( Sees that DEREK is displeased ) I know you do n't like him , Derek , but the world 's full of people one does n't like . Do you suppose I like my clients ? With very few exceptions  --  no . And do you suppose they like me ? Most of them ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to . ( PENGO sits at his desk , going over one memo after another with tremendous concentration and signing them . At the same time he is talking to DEREK . PENGO picks up a letter and glances at it ) Mrs. Bovington . From Palm Beach . She misses me . DEREK PENGO Who 's Mrs. Bovington ? LORD PENGO One of the most important widows in America ! DEREK PENGO Rather an odd classification . LORD PENGO Do n't you know , my boy , that the widows own America ? Their husbands die prematurely of exhaustion getting it for them . ( He signs the last memo , gets up , goes to the Allendale and stands before it in an ecstasy of contemplation ) Look at it , my boy , look at it ! Have you ever seen anything so stupendous , so overpowering , so p. 33 DEREK PENGO You seem to forget , Dad  --  I 'm not a customer ! LORD PENGO It 's a miracle . DEREK PENGO It is beautiful . LORD PENGO ( Wheels around ) You misunderstand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the miracle . DEREK PENGO You wo n't own it long . LORD PENGO I 'll own it forever . DEREK PENGO ( Teasing him ) Can you afford it ? LORD PENGO In my own mind , I consider that I merely lease my pictures to my customers . After I 'm gone , you 'll write my life , Derek , and you 'll make clear that I have done pioneer work . I have made the Americans artconscious . DEREK PENGO Who 's writing this biography  --  you or me ? LORD PENGO But it 's true ! Look at me  --  I have been exalted by my merchandise . I want the Americans to be exalted by it too . DEREK PENGO You certainly make them pay through the nose for it ! LORD PENGO Only for art , dear boy . The exaltation is free ! ( With a last look at the Allendale ) Terrific ! Terrific ! p. 34 DEREK PENGO You 're constantly selling , are n't you ? If not to your customers  --  to yourself ! LORD PENGO What 's wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pastime And speaking of selling  --  it becomes my unpleasant duty to reprimand you . For your own good , you understand ! DEREK PENGO I know ! It 'll hurt you more than it hurts me ! LORD PENGO It does , as a matter of fact . You lost me the sale of the Houdon bust to Bingham . I instructed you to ask fifty thousand dollars for it . DEREK PENGO ( Shamefacedly ) I did ! LORD PENGO No , you did n't . Johnson was present and he told me . You kept saying fi-fi-fi-  --  you could n't seem to get it out . DEREK PENGO It seemed an awful lot to ask . LORD PENGO Anyone to whom fifty thousand dollars seems to be a lot of money should n't be working for me ! DEREK PENGO That 's what I keep telling you , Dad . I should n't be working for you . LORD PENGO ( Soothing him ) No harm done . I 'll sell it to some other American for sixty . But practice , Derek , practice . Keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and over to yourself till it comes naturally . p. 35 DEREK PENGO It 's no good , Father . I 'll never get used to it . You 'd better fire me . LORD PENGO Ca n't . Your mother would never forgive me . ( VICKERS , a dried-up , fussy , anxious little accountant , enters . He carries some financial statements ) Well , Vickers  --  how are we ? VICKERS Thank you , your Lordship ( He looks unhappily at DEREK ) DEREK PENGO Hello , Vickers . VICKERS How do you do , Mr. Derek ? DEREK PENGO I have a feeling Vickers would rather see you alone , Father . LORD PENGO Not at all . Why should he ? ( To VICKERS ) It 's all going to belong to Derek one day , Vickers , and the more he learns about the facts of life in art , the better . VICKERS ( Coughs ) The fact is , my Lord LORD PENGO Yes , Vickers ? VICKERS The fact is  --  to put it bluntly  --  we are overextended ! LORD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? p. 36 VICKERS Very much . We have bank notes coming due , here in London alone , within the next four months ( He pauses impressively ) to the tune of one million four hundred thousand pounds ! LORD PENGO Four months is a long time . A lot may happen in four months . VICKERS ( Pessimistically ) Sincerely trust that it does , your Lordship . LORD PENGO ( To DEREK ) Vickers always tells me what I owe other people . He never tells me what other people owe me . VICKERS I am aware of that , your Lordship . LORD PENGO What do they owe me in America , Vickers ? What , for example , does Phineas D. Terwilliger owe me ? VICKERS Seven hundred and fifty thousand pounds , your Lordship . LORD PENGO ( Teasing him ) Do n't you think he 's good for it ? The richest man in the world ( With a wink to DEREK ) though I have several clients who are richer ! VICKERS If you will forgive me , your Lordship  --  it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your own . p. 37 LORD PENGO ( Does n't like this ) Nonsense . In America alone VICKERS Our American outstandings will more than meet our obligations  --  if you collect them . But you never ask for money , your Lordship . You let them hold on to our inventory forever . Millions in capital tied up . And you go on spending . LORD PENGO ( Conscious of DEREK as an audience ) Ca n't talk to my American clients about money . It would be undignified . Besides , the subject bores me . VICKERS We 'd be all right  --  if only you stopped buying ! LORD PENGO Then what will I sell ? VICKERS ( His voice rises ; it is an old issue between them ) Your basement . Liquidate your basement . It 's full of stuff . Get rid of it . LORD PENGO Why is it in the basement ? Because I could n't get rid of it . VICKERS Sell it to another dealer . Sell it to Heimler 's . LORD PENGO And let Heimler 's establish a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be in the basement , Vickers , but they 're still Pengos. p. 38 VICKERS ( His voice rises in a wail of pleading ) If you 'd only stop buying new stuff LORD PENGO ( Ca n't resist ) What I buy is very old stuff . VICKERS If you 'd only stop buying anything  --  just for six months  --  I might be able to strike a trial balance . Forgive me , your Lordship , but this time the situation is really serious . I ca n't sleep nights worrying that the banks will call our loans . If you 'd only hold in for six months ! LORD PENGO ( To soothe him ; VICKERS is really in a state ) All right , Vickers , I 'll try . VICKERS ( Turns to DEREK for help ) You see the point , do n't you , Mr. Derek ? DEREK PENGO Of course I do , Vickers . But you know Father  --  he 's incorrigible . VICKERS ( Sweating ) I would appreciate your help , Mr. Derek . DEREK PENGO I 'll do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for speaking so frankly . I felt it was my duty . LORD PENGO Of course , Vickers , I understand perfectly . I 'll try to do better . p. 39 VICKERS It is of the utmost importance , I assure you . Lately , I 've been at my wit 's end . If you do n't stop spending I shall never be able to make a respectable trial balance . It will kill our credit . Good morning , your Lordship . LORD PENGO Thank you , Vickers . ( VICKERS goes out . PENGO looks after him , meditatively ) You would think , to listen to Vickers , that all I exist for is to help him with a trial balance . A respectable trial balance . What would be an illicit trial balance ? What ? DEREK PENGO Well , he has a point , you know . LORD PENGO Of course he has a point . Admirable fellow , Vickers . Been with me since my father 's day . But let me tell you something about Vickers , and all comptrollers . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that remaining one percent , that one percent when they 're wrong and I 'm right  --  on that one percent  --  I live . ( JOHNSON comes in with a cable ) JOHNSON Cable , my Lord . LORD PENGO ( Rips the cable open as JOHNSON goes out ; apoplectic ) Damn ! DEREK PENGO What 's the matter ? p. 40 LORD PENGO It 's gone astray . DEREK PENGO What has ? LORD PENGO Cosmo Prince 's ballroom . DEREK PENGO Have you mislaid it ? LORD PENGO I bought him a Renaissance ballroom out of the Lamballe Palace in Rome . Had the whole thing shipped  --  down to the last doorknob . ( Taps the cable furiously ) And now it 's got lost somewhere in transit . DEREK PENGO Insufficient postage , perhaps . ( By this time PENGO is at the telephone ) LORD PENGO It 's no joke , Derek . Cosmo Prince is the most important press lord in America . Very impatient man when he does n't get what he wants . ( Into the phone ) Get me Burgess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving a big ball at his ranch in California and he wants a proper room to give it in . ( He 's got Burgess ) Burgess , I just had a cable . Cosmo Prince 's ballroom is lost in transit . What about it ? ( A moment ; PENGO is very angry ) If you know what 's good for you , Burgess , you 'll trace that ballroom ! ( He bangs the telephone down ) p. 41 DEREK PENGO ( Tense , making a supreme effort ) Father , I I 've got to talk to you . LORD PENGO Well , are n't we ? DEREK PENGO I mean  --  about myself . I 've been on the verge of telling you for a long time but I never get the chance to talk to you . LORD PENGO ( Somewhat impatient ) Well , what is it ? What do you want to tell me ? DEREK PENGO The fact is I 'm unhappy . I do n't want to sell . I 'm not a salesman . LORD PENGO With the inventory I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prestige I leave you  --  you wo n't have to be a salesman . A Pengo will be its own trademark . DEREK PENGO I 'll never be able to succeed you , Dad . It 's like a great physician who leaves his practice to a son who has n't got the bedside manner . I 'm so torn , Dad . LORD PENGO What about ? DEREK PENGO It 's hard for me to say ( Smiles at his father ) I 've acquired the English restraint . But , after all , we are Hungarians , are n't we ? You were born there , so why should n't I say that I 'm so very fond of you  --  in fact I  --  p. 42 LORD PENGO You adore me . Say it right out  --  as if it were fifty thousand dollars ! DEREK PENGO ( Does come out with it ) Yes . I do . At the same time LORD PENGO Come out with it . What is it ? DEREK PENGO There are times when I 'm ashamed of you . I suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certainly . I know . DEREK PENGO You clown so , Dad . You amuse these people , I know ; but you make yourself a clown to do it . LORD PENGO It 's my passport to their society . Why should they put up with me if I do n't entertain them ? I am not ambitious to be one of them . Not at all . I feel I have to pay my way , by amusing them ! DEREK PENGO Court jester ! LORD PENGO Very good , Derek . Could n't be better put ! DEREK PENGO Look , Dad  --  you 've got the most beautiful pictures in the world . Why do n't you let them sell themselves ? Why do you have to exploit them , and yourself , the way you do ? LORD PENGO I know I 've got the most beautiful pictures in the world , you know it , Berenson knows it  --  but the Americans do n't know it ! p. 43 DEREK PENGO Why must you employ people like Wilfred Oliver ? LORD PENGO ( Making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's not a nice fellow . LORD PENGO He 's useful . DEREK PENGO Why do n't you employ him openly then ? The secret payroll : butlers , maids , valets LORD PENGO They all do it , my boy , even my most respectable rivals . It 's a trade technique . DEREK PENGO I hate it  --  the whole technique . You make charlatans out of the pictures . LORD PENGO ( Equably ) How ? DEREK PENGO By sensationalizing them . Always getting them into the papers  --  and yourself . You talk too much  --  in public and private . Why do n't you keep quiet ? LORD PENGO Do you want me to be like my customers , who never say a word ? DEREK PENGO Let the pictures speak for you ! LORD PENGO Most of my pictures are Italian . They do n't speaka da English ! ( Appeals to him ) Do n't you want me to have any fun , my boy ? Do you grudge me a little fun ? ( Goes to door  --  speaks to JOHNSON , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Drury to detach herself from her party . I wish to speak to her alone for a moment . p. 44 JOHNSON ( Offstage ) Yes , my Lord . DEREK PENGO That 's what I want , but I never seem to get the chance ! LORD PENGO What ? DEREK PENGO To speak to you alone for a moment ! LORD PENGO Something worrying you ? DEREK PENGO A lot . LORD PENGO What is it ? The Drury girl ? Daphne ? DEREK PENGO That 's part of it . LORD PENGO You know , Derek , I wish you 'd marry a less complicated girl . Also DEREK PENGO Well ? LORD PENGO Her father would be furious . I 'd lose all chance to get him as a customer . DEREK PENGO Everything for selling LORD PENGO I believe I made a mistake , Derek , when I sent you to an English public school . They do n't evidently teach you the facts of life . DEREK PENGO Dad ! There 's something  --  terribly important to me  --  that I 've been hiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you about . LORD PENGO What is it ? p. 45 DEREK PENGO I ca n't just blurt it out  --  it 's too personal . You 've got to give me time . LORD PENGO On the boat  --  we 'll have plenty of time on the boat . DEREK PENGO On the boat you 'll be selling dull eighteenth-century portraits to Brink . LORD PENGO ( Casually , enjoying the little surprise ) Do you call the Blue Boy of Gainsborough dull ? DEREK PENGO ( Astonished ) But you do n't own the Blue Boy . LORD PENGO ( With a wide smile at him ) No , but I will . After I 've sold it to Brink  --  I 'll buy it ! ( DEREK ca n't help laughing ) That 's the spirit , my boy . Have fun ! I have fun . DEREK PENGO I know you do , but all the same , I have an awful feeling , Dad .

Is n't she lovely ? p. 46 DEREK PENGO ( Looking at the photograph ) I love that photograph . Mother complains about you , you know  --  she never sees you . LORD PENGO ( Staring at the photograph ) I 've got plans for that too , my boy . One day  --  one day I 'll buy a beautiful place somewhere and we 'll settle down and live happily , forever ( PRIMROSE comes in ) PRIMROSE DRURY ( In ecstasy ) Joe , I 'm just in love with that Goya  --  that darling little Red Boy ! LORD PENGO He is a darling , is n't he ? And I 'm about to sell Wally the Blue Boy . If you marry Wally , Prim , you 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Blue Boy . He 's wishy-washy . LORD PENGO I love you , Prim , because you know what you like . PRIMROSE DRURY And what do you think , Joe ? That nice Mr. Oliver , I just met , he 's sailing too . LORD PENGO Oh , is he ? PRIMROSE DRURY He 's charming . LORD PENGO Yes , charming . But he knows it ! Exquisite taste in furniture and decoration but not much else . A light-weight , really . p. 47 PRIMROSE DRURY ( To DEREK ) Oh , Derek , I just spoke to Daphne she says yes she 'll have dinner with you.You 're to pick her up at Prince 's Gate . DEREK PENGO Fine . ( He goes out ) PRIMROSE DRURY When 's Drury coming , Joe ? LORD PENGO Any minute . PRIMROSE DRURY I 'm so nervous I ca n't stand it . Have n't seen him for three years and four months . S'pose he cuts me ? Capable of it , you know . He 's a cold man  --  on the surface anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shall I leave you alone with him ? PRIMROSE DRURY ( Panicked ) Do n't do that . I just want to see him  --  see how he acts . LORD PENGO ( To change the subject ) Derek seems to have your daughter considerably on his mind . PRIMROSE DRURY I know . LORD PENGO Is he at all on her mind ? PRIMROSE DRURY Daphne tells me she loves Derek . LORD PENGO ( Shrewdly ) Is that encouraging ? p. 48 PRIMROSE DRURY She 's a funny girl , Daphne . I just do n't understand her way of lovin ' . While she 's lovin ' she 's lookin ' somewhere else to see what 's cookin ' in another direction . She 's got pretty feet but she 's never swept off ' em . When I was her age , I was sure swept off mine . LORD PENGO Derek better get over it . PRIMROSE DRURY Feel kinda sorry for the boy . Afraid Daphne 'll make him suffer . LORD PENGO Oh well , we all go through that when we 're young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you could get over it when you 're older ! That 's what my analyst keeps tellin ' me . Dr. Jerome Auerbach . LORD PENGO Oh , I know Dr. Auerbach . What does he tell you ? PRIMROSE DRURY Stop hangin ' around waitin ' for Drury to come back , he keeps tellin ' me . LORD PENGO Sound advice . PRIMROSE DRURY If I divorced him , I 'd have to give up Daphne . Would n't be good for Daphne . Besides , I hate divorce . Hate the idea of being a divorced woman . LORD PENGO Venture to say you would n't be in that position for long . PRIMROSE DRURY That 's the trouble . p. 49 LORD PENGO What do you mean ? PRIMROSE DRURY Oh , Joe , you know , I 'm so romantic . With my nature , I 'm afraid if I were free I 'd do something silly . And so would Enoch . That tramp who 's got her hooks on him would get him . LORD PENGO What happened between you and Drury anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few years it was . I was so young when he married me . I was so flattered . Imagine , Joe . Imagine what it meant for a girl like me  --  worked since I was a kid in a vaudeville act  --  married to a man who had a whole town named after him . Drury , Illinois . And I was to be Mrs. Drury . Mrs. Drury , Illinois . LORD PENGO Was Drury , Illinois , gay ? PRIMROSE DRURY That 's what it was n't ! I had such plans . What I was going to do in the town  --  get friendly with the people , and do things for them . But when I got there I found that everybody in Drury hated Drury and that Drury hated them . And there 'd be strikes and Enoch hired people who went out and  --  well , there 'd be shooting . And that house we lived in  --  that great , silent house we lived in . Enoch always in conference with other silent men . Oh , it was awful ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 50 PRIMROSE DRURY Because I 'm sorry for him . Funny thing is , he wants to be loved too . People say he 's cold ; he ai n't really , he 's stubborn . Take his political ambitions ; he 's always nominated , never elected . ( A moment ) Joe , will you promise me something ? LORD PENGO Anything at all . PRIMROSE DRURY If you ever get a chance , Joe LORD PENGO Yes , my dear ? PRIMROSE DRURY If you ever get close to him  --  the way you do to people LORD PENGO Not likely with him . PRIMROSE DRURY Well , if you do LORD PENGO Yes ? PRIMROSE DRURY ( Simply ) Tell him I worship him , will you ? LORD PENGO Why do n't you tell him yourself ? PRIMROSE DRURY Have n't got the nerve , ( Smiles fondly at him ) Joe , I wish you were sailing . LORD PENGO Be there in three weeks . PRIMROSE DRURY We 've got to talk over the plans for the house . Do you think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That hotel of yours is depressing . PRIMROSE DRURY Kind of afraid I 'll rattle around in a big house . Without a man  --  what good is a house ? LORD PENGO You 've been alone too much , Prim . You 've been brooding too much . Because your marriage to Drury was a failure you think of yourself as a failure . It 's ridiculous . I 'll fill your house with the best people  --  and the best pictures . PRIMROSE DRURY You cheer me up , Joe , you really do ! LORD PENGO The Red Boy will cheer you up even more . PRIMROSE DRURY Hope you 're not going to make me pay too much for him . LORD PENGO My dear Primrose , if I do n't make you pay a lot for him you wo n't respect him ! PRIMROSE DRURY ( Delighted ) You kill me , Joe . You really do ! ( JOHNSON comes in ) JOHNSON Mr. Drury is downstairs , my Lord . LORD PENGO A moment , Johnson . I 'll buzz . ( JOHNSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in a flutter ) PRIMROSE DRURY I ca n't do it . I ca n't . If he acted  --  you know  --  cold  --  it 'd break me up . p. 52 LORD PENGO Why do n't you go downstairs and just run into him  --  accidentally ? PRIMROSE DRURY I just ca n't . How do you get out of here ? LORD PENGO ( He is at a small door to the left , which he opens for her ) Through here . PRIMROSE DRURY ( Runs to the door ) I 'm a mess , Joe . I do n't know whether I 'm comin ' or goin ' . ( She runs out . PENGO shuts the door after her . He goes into action , buzzes for FILBERT , who comes in at once ) LORD PENGO Filbert . Drape the Allendale . ( FILBERT arranges a velvet curtain to cover the Allendale ) All right , Filbert . Tell Johnson to show Mr. Drury in . ( PENGO gets a firm grip on himself . His lips murmur adulatory phrases . JOHNSON comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Mr. Enoch Drury . ( JOHNSON goes . ENOCH DRURY is elegant , aloof , patrician . He has a noble head and an astringent voice ) LORD PENGO ( Advancing to DRURY ) I am happy to see you again , Mr. Drury . p. 53 ENOCH DRURY Thank you . ( They do not shake hands ) LORD PENGO Would you like a drink  --  a cup of tea perhaps ? ENOCH DRURY I am afraid I am pressed for time . LORD PENGO Actually I have to be at the House of Lords myself at three-thirty . ENOCH DRURY I should be pleased to see the Allendale . I know it is a beautiful picture . But I must advise you that if it is a Titian  --  I sha n't be interested . I am well supplied with Titians . LORD PENGO Berenson certifies it as a Giorgione . ENOCH DRURY ( Coldly ) I have heard the contrary . LORD PENGO I shall satisfy you on that point , Mr. Drury . ( A pause . DRURY says nothing . Finally ) As I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Giorgione brought in here . ENOCH DRURY Thank you . LORD PENGO Wo n't you sit down while I show it to you properly ? ENOCH DRURY Thank you . ( PENGO pushes a beautifully brocaded armchair midstage before the Allendale . DRURY sits in it ) p. 54 LORD PENGO I may tell you , Mr. Drury , that since that greatest of all masterpieces has come into my possession , I have been unable to eat or sleep There it is ! Feast your eyes upon it  --  the Allendale Giorgione . ( DRURY listens to this impassively . PENGO shuts off the lights , leaving on only the electrolier that lights the Allendale . A silence . PENGO goes on  --  eloquent in a vacuum ) It is not merely a painting you will observe , Mr. Drury . What shall I say ? It is music . Colored music . ( He peers narrowly at DRURY to see the effect . There is no effect . DRURY is staring at some inner vision ) This picture , I fondly believe , will confer immortality upon you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will know Enoch Drury . Your name will be linked in this life and through eternity  --  The Drury Giorgione ! ( PENGO peers at DRURY again . DRURY remains impassive ) A distinguished partnership , do n't you think ? ( PENGO hopes for an answer . DRURY does not look as if he wanted to go into partnership with anybody . There is no answer . PENGO gives up and with a certain despair goes into the solemn facts of biography ) You know that Giorgione died when he was thirty-two years old ( Totally unaffected by this premature death , DRURY sits in stony silence . On this impasse the curtain slowly descends ) @x Scene : LORD PENGO 'S art gallery in New York , five months later . It is a large , sumptuous room done in classic Greek Revival in several tones of gold and soft cream . The walls are covered in velvet . Up center is a pillared arch showing a large sky-lighted gallery . On the back wall of the gallery hangs a large portrait of Mrs. Siddons by Reynolds . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the left wall , downstage , we see the Masaccio which was visible in Act One . On the right , on a pedestal , is an exquisite bust of a little girl by Settignano . Between the pillars is an architect 's model of an art museum . This model stands on a wheeled base . On the right , downstage , is a Renaissance throne on a dais . Over the throne is a pillared baldachino . At rise : MISS SWANSON , PENGO 'S American first secretary , is sitting at PENGO 'S desk going over some memoranda . MISS SWANSON is a spinster of uncertain age , severely dressed , with her hair done up in a topknot . She has a sharp mind . She has been with PENGO for thirty years  --  is used to him  --  and is fascinated by him . She 's known DEREK since he was an infant and adores him . DEREK walks in . He is in low spirits . MISS SWANSON ( Holds up an invoice and studies it pensively ) Now would you please tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you please tell me how the noble Lord , your father , could make a Jewish hotel man from Chicago feel that he just had to have twelve madonnas ? p. 56 DEREK PENGO Perhaps he 's got a mother complex . MISS SWANSON And for this highly restored Renaissance dame who could n't have been so hot even before she was restored , Mr. Enoch Drury is paying four hundred and eighty-five thousand dollars . DEREK PENGO That 's reasonable ! MISS SWANSON The higher they are the harder they fall . It 's really wonderful , Derek , to see your father operate on these boys . They 're all jealous of Drury , you know . Especially Brink . Your father says to Brink : " My dear Wally , Drury may have the mountains , but you have the peaks . " Then he tells Drury : " Brink may have the peaks , my dear Mr. Drury , but you have the mountains " DEREK PENGO Dad is certainly master of the reversible compliment . MISS SWANSON You 're not your usual bright self lately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about everything . MISS SWANSON Your sweetheart 's back in town , you should be oh-so-happy ! DEREK PENGO I 'm oh-so-miserable . MISS SWANSON Tell the Beatrice Fairfax of Fifty-seventh Street . DEREK PENGO I 'm in a false position . With Daphne , with my father , with this business  --  with everything . Chiefly with myself . No decision . No courage . p. 57 MISS SWANSON You promised me you 'd tell your father about your secret ambition . That you do n't want to sell pictures , that you want to paint them . DEREK PENGO I 've tried to tell him . Like the fif-fif-fifty thousand dollars , I could n't get it out . Especially the kind of thing I want to paint . Can you imagine Father ! You know how he hates modern painting . MISS SWANSON I 've shown your work to several of my emancipated art-critic friends . They say it shows originality and promise . DEREK PENGO ( His face alight with pleasure  --  incredulously ) Did they ? Did they really ? MISS SWANSON You seem surprised . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting I 'm happy but I struggle with uncertainty . Half the time I think I 'm crazy  --  presumptuous  --  to think that I could ever be an artist . What you tell me  --  and I know you would n't say it if it were n't true  --  is reassuring It 's the first encouragement I 've had . It 's welcome . MISS SWANSON There 's enough there to convince me . DEREK PENGO You know , Miss Swanson , I have been spoon-fed on the most expensive paint in the world  --  it 's beginning to choke me . I feel things differently from these people . I have got to find my own way to  --  p. 58 MISS SWANSON You 're doomed to be an artist . Tell you what , Derek ! I 'll give you a room in my mother 's cottage in Glens Falls . Tell your father you 're resigning and go up there and paint ! DEREK PENGO I 'd love to if Daphne came along . MISS SWANSON Ca n't see Daphne in Glens Falls . Not quite . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Daphne . She blows hot and cold . One day she 's all lovey-dovey , the next day I ca n't get her on the telephone . There 's something wrong . Have felt it lately . Truth is , Miss Swanson MISS SWANSON What ? DEREK PENGO I 'm a misfit . MISS SWANSON So are most artists . That 's what makes them artists . DEREK PENGO Father 's overwhelming . Just as I 'm most angry with him  --  MISS SWANSON He becomes so enchanting or so funny that you forgive him . DEREK PENGO Yes . MISS SWANSON I 've been up against that for years ! It would be a private revenge for me in a way if you stood up to him . I love the irony of it  --  that he , who buys up modern pictures to hide them away in his basement so his clients wo n't get used to them , should find himself fathering them You take the bull by the horns and tell him . p. 59 DEREK PENGO It 's not easy . When I tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What , those detached eyes swimming in tomato sauce ? You admire those ? " It dries me up . MISS SWANSON You 've just got to do it . DEREK PENGO He 'll have a fit . MISS SWANSON He sure will . Oh boy , how I 'll tease him ! DEREK PENGO Well , Miss Swanson , you give me courage . I 'll tell him the dark secret . Where is Father ? MISS SWANSON With Sir William Fitzpatrick planning Primrose 's great mansion . And speaking of romance , how is that oh-so-exquisite Wilfred Oliver getting along with doll Primrose ? DEREK PENGO She dotes on him . Poor Prim  --  I 'm worried about her . MISS SWANSON Why ? She 's having fun , is n't she ? What 's wrong with that ? DEREK PENGO She 's gone head-over-heels  --  she has n't got a chance against that sleazy Don Juan . MISS SWANSON Do you think he 'll get her to marry him ? DEREK PENGO Of course he will  --  she 's vulnerable  --  he 's nimble . What a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes me sick , you know . p. 60 MISS SWANSON Why ? DEREK PENGO What 's Dad running anyway ? An art gallery or a matrimonial agency ? MISS SWANSON That 's just what I asked your father DEREK PENGO ( Amused ) Dad will take anything from you ! What did he say ? MISS SWANSON " The point is , Miss Swanson , " he said , " we 're selling ! " With him it 's a kind of disembodied activity  --  like praying ! ( She holds up another invoice ) Oh , boy ! Oh , boy ! Oh , boy ! DEREK PENGO What 's that ? MISS SWANSON Invoice to Walter Cannon Brink , the Third . If I had that money if I had a hundredth part of that money DEREK PENGO What would you do with it , Miss Swanson ? MISS SWANSON I would n't be spending it on lousy eighteenth-century English portraits ! ( PENGO has come in and hears this ) LORD PENGO ( In wonderful humor ) Really , Miss Swanson ! Now really ! What language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the only American employed here . Do n't you think , Derek , it was a mistake ? p. 61 MISS SWANSON I know your linguistic standards are high , Joe . Nothing but the purest French-Hungarian-Cockney spoken here . LORD PENGO I 'm afraid I 'll have to fire you for that remark , Miss Swanson . I have n't the heart to do it . Derek , you 'll have to do it . MISS SWANSON Come , come , Joe , those Englishmen in cutaways you 've got downstairs bore the pants off you . You know they do ! LORD PENGO At least , Miss Swanson , you might respect the pictures . MISS SWANSON What ! Those eighteenth-century aunts and uncles and nieces ! ( To DEREK ) Brink the Third bought thirty-eight relatives of forgotten eighteenth-century aristocrats . Why does n't he have his own relatives painted and hang them ? LORD PENGO It is obvious , Miss Swanson , that you have n't seen Brink 's relatives . MISS SWANSON ( Gets up to go ; takes a sheaf of invoices with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Swanson ? MISS SWANSON Cosmo Prince called up from California . He 's fit to be tied . LORD PENGO What 's wrong ? p. 62 MISS SWANSON That globe-trotting ballroom you sold him has n't turned up yet ! ( PENGO is very angry . He grabs a telephone ) LORD PENGO ( Into the phone ) Cable London . Burgess is fired . And trace that ballroom in twenty-four hours or the same will happen to you ! MISS SWANSON ( At the door ) Poor Cosmo . He 's only got ninety rooms . Guess he 'll have to give that ball in the privy ! ( She goes out ) LORD PENGO ( Suddenly moody ) Miss Swanson goes too far . DEREK PENGO I 've just left Mother . She 's awfully miffed with you , Dad . LORD PENGO ( Innocent surprise ; he knows perfectly well what for ) Really ? She was her usual sweet self last night at dinner . ( He picks up the Settignano Head of a Little Girl and adores it ) How do you like this little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LORD PENGO Saving her for your mother 's birthday . DEREK PENGO Oh , good ! She 'll love it ! LORD PENGO Your mother always wanted a girl  --  in addition to you , of course . Well , here she is What 's your mother miffed with me about ? p. 63 DEREK PENGO About Wetmore . The best butler she ever had , she says . You fired him . LORD PENGO ( With a twinkle ) On the contrary  --  I 've promoted him ! DEREK PENGO Have you ? To what ? LORD PENGO ( With an effulgent , loving smile ) I 've placed him with Enoch Drury . DEREK PENGO ( Astonished ) At Drury 's ! No ! LORD PENGO Yes , indeed He 's there now . It will be useful , Derek . Ca n't tell you how secure it makes me feel to have Wetmore at Drury 's . DEREK PENGO With Wetmore at Drury 's you 'll know instantly which of your rivals will have the effrontery to show their wares to the great man . LORD PENGO You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upset . Your mother 's a wonderful woman , Derek , but inclined to be petty . This little Settignano 'll make it up to her ! ( MISS SWANSON comes in ) MISS SWANSON Sorry to interrupt . The New York Herald just called . Bad news , Joe . LORD PENGO ( Irritably ) Well ? p. 64 MISS SWANSON Scotus B. Slemp is dead . LORD PENGO ( Devastated ) No ! Ca n't be . Saw him yesterday . MISS SWANSON Nevertheless , he 's gone . The paper wants a statement . LORD PENGO Two million dollars ' worth of my stuff on consignment to him MISS SWANSON I know LORD PENGO ( With mounting indignation ) Dawdled and dawdled haggled and haggled Would n't make up his mind MISS SWANSON As his heirs do n't like you , it 'll all come back here . LORD PENGO Raphael 's Madonna MISS SWANSON She 'll come back ! What about the statement ? LORD PENGO ( Furious ) You see , Derek , what fools my clients are ? Statement ! Statement ! Had Slemp not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could say Scotus B. Slemp died owning one of the greatest pictures in the world , Raphael 's Alba Madonna . Now what is there to say about him ? MISS SWANSON You might say he just barely missed owning Raphael 's Alba Madonna . p. 65 LORD PENGO ( Glares at her ) We are not amused , Miss Swanson ! MISS SWANSON After all , Joe , Slemp did n't die just to annoy you ! LORD PENGO What do they think , these fellows  --  that they 're eternal ? This is serious . MISS SWANSON ( Wearily ) They want a statement . LORD PENGO Get that educated librarian of mine , what's-his-name  --  McGiveny  --  to write it . Do n't bother me . MISS SWANSON I 'll try . LORD PENGO ( Shouts ) You 're fired , Miss Swanson . Get yourself another job ! MISS SWANSON Thank you , my Lord . Buzz me if you want me . ( She goes out ) LORD PENGO ( In a brown study , muses ) Who can I sell the Raphael to ? Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Three-quarters of a million . There are not many , Derek not many who 'll pay How stupid of Slemp ! He 'll never forgive himself ! DEREK PENGO ( Ca n't help laughing ) Oh , Dad ! LORD PENGO ( Smiles ruefully ) In heaven , I mean ! You see , Derek , you see what I 'm up against . I 'm in a relay race . p. 66 DEREK PENGO How do you mean ? LORD PENGO With death DEREK PENGO ( Concerned ) Are n't you well , Father ? LORD PENGO Well , I 'm not as young as I used to be . And neither are my clients . I spent a million dollars on this building for a dozen customers . When I barged into the American market there were three greats : Morgan , Altman , the elder Widener . They all died on me . DEREK PENGO Bad form ! LORD PENGO They died on the pictures . They could all have done better . My clients are so rich and powerful they think they 'll live forever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrated . After Morgan , Altman and Widener died , I got three more , and they all died on me too . And now there are Drury , Terwilliger , Brink  --  all aging  --  and all cautious . I tell you , Derek , they drive me crazy with their hesitations . DEREK PENGO I do n't see why you go on with it . Surely you 've made enough money by now . LORD PENGO That shows how little you understand me  --  if you think it 's money I 'm after . DEREK PENGO What then ? LORD PENGO ( All this time he has been thinking of the Raphael ; suddenly , with the illumination of a problem miraculously solved ) Of course , Derek ! Of course ! p. 67 DEREK PENGO Of course what ? LORD PENGO Drury  --  Drury must buy the Raphael ! ( Darts to the phone ) Get me Wetmore . ( Hangs up ) What a lucky break for Drury  --  Slemp popping off like that ! To those that hath , Derek , shall be given . Lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to personal relations ) Outside of your business , you have n't an interest in the world . Look at your relations with Mother . LORD PENGO ( Bridling ) What 's wrong with my relations with your mother ? I 'm a devoted husband . I never so much as look at another woman . DEREK PENGO And you do n't look at her , either . She was complaining to me only yesterday  --  you 've been telling her for years : " Some , day we 'll live quietly and normally and happily . " When is it coming , this perpetually receding " some day " ? LORD PENGO ( Suddenly quiet ) When my Design is completed . DEREK PENGO What design ? LORD PENGO My Grand Design . ( The telephone rings ; PENGO answers ) Wetmore , I 'd like very much to speak to Mr. Drury something important has come up Oh ? When will he be back ? ( PENGO 'S voice rises somewhat ) Did he ? Did he really ? Well , if he should n't come here , tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? Thank you , my boy . ( PENGO hangs up . He faces DEREK in triumph ) Wetmore says Drury may visit me here . We 're going up in the world , Derek . p. 68 DEREK PENGO ( Insists ) What is your Grand Design ? ( PENGO goes to the model of the museum and lays his hand tenderly on it ) LORD PENGO This  --  by my pet American architect Design for a national gallery  --  the ultimate destination of all my pictures  --  DEREK PENGO ( Skeptically ) That 's a noble objective ! LORD PENGO It is my dream . I am grateful to my pictures . They 've given me a career , a reason for existence  --  everything . DEREK PENGO As I say  --  it 's a noble objective . But is this altruism  --  unadulterated ? LORD PENGO My dear boy , no motive is unadulterated . Still ( With a wave of his hand toward the glorified walls ) these pictures are my dependents and I must make some provision for them after my departure . ( FILBERT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PENGO snatches it , rips it open . FILBERT goes ) LORD PENGO From Berenson . DEREK PENGO What about ? p. 69 LORD PENGO ( As he studies the cable ) It 's not a good day , Derek ! DEREK PENGO The Allendale ? LORD PENGO Listen . ( He reads the cable ) " It is true that I once said the Allendale was a Giorgione . That was thirty years ago . I am now convinced the picture was by Titian  --  in fact , that it is the earliest known Titian . I never stick to a mistake . " ( He is apoplectic with rage ) You see , Derek , what I 'm up against ! A mistake ! He calls it a mistake . The only sensible guess Berenson ever made ! A mistake ! ( He picks up a heavy paperweight and bangs it on glass-topped desk . He strides around the room in a froth of anger ) Berenson crossing me up like this ! I tell you , Derek , Berenson may know what is beautiful , but only I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the Masaccio ) This Masaccio ! Berenson begged me to buy it . It 's been hanging here forever , and no one buys it . It 's gloomy . My clients do n't want gloomy pictures . Why should they ? They 're gloomy themselves . They want color , beauty , and so do I. ( He stares at it ) What is it , anyway ? The Ascension , is n't it ? DEREK PENGO No . The Circumcision . LORD PENGO That makes it worse ! No wonder nobody buys it . I 'm sick of seeing it hanging there . I ( He looks at Berenson 's cable again , crumples it and throws it on the floor ) And now this mess over the Allendale . Drury 'll never buy it now . He does n't want another Titian . He wants a Giorgione. p. 70 DEREK PENGO It 's a great picture  --  whether it 's by Titian or Giorgione . LORD PENGO I 've taught Drury  --  I 've taught them all  --  to rely on Berenson 's opinion . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's like arguing whether Hamlet is by Shakespeare or Bacon . It 's still Hamlet . LORD PENGO ( Shouts at him ) Look , Derek , if you do n't see the difference between Giorgione and Titian , I 'll tell you . It 's a difference of four hundred thousand dollars . ( He taps the cable ) But the worst of it is , Drury will lose confidence in me . ( Paces about in agitated concentration  --  wheels about abruptly  --  struck by a new idea ) I wonder , Derek  --  DEREK PENGO What ? LORD PENGO Maybe I can sell the Allendale to Sylvester Schmitt . DEREK PENGO I did n't know that Schmitt was interested . LORD PENGO Neither does he , but he 'll find out . He was in here , you know , the other day . DEREK PENGO Oh , was he ? LORD PENGO You would have been very amused . p. 71 DEREK PENGO What 's he like , Schmitt ? LORD PENGO Well , you know he owns a thousand chain stores all over the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see things by the gross . Something about Schmitt  --  he ca n't resist a gross of anything . Well , I did n't have a gross , but I did pretty well . Filbert lugged in three Valesquezes , a Tintoretto , two Donatellos , three Houdon busts , and some tapestries I 'd bought from King Alfonso of Spain . " How much for the lot ? " he said . I named a dainty figure . Never had such a good time , Derek . Schmitt just sat there and glared at me . DEREK PENGO Did you land him ? LORD PENGO He got up stiffly and said he was n't interested . I said I would save these things for him . " Do n't save them , Lord Pengo , " he said , " I 'm not interested . " Since then I hear he tells everybody I 'm a robber and that he 'll never set foot inside this place again . DEREK PENGO Then you did n't land him ? LORD PENGO On the contrary , I consider the things are sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hovering on the abyss of commitment . DEREK PENGO I think I may trust you to push him over . LORD PENGO But you do n't realize what a character this man is ! He 's rich enough , if he wanted to , to charter the Berengaria and go around the world on it . And you know what he does with his evenings ? Attends the Burton Holmes Travelogues . That 's how he satisfies his wanderlust . And he saves the programs . Is n't it sweet ? Very lonely man he is really ( The telephone rings ; PENGO answers ) as so many of these fellows are . Who ? Oliver ? ( At the mention of OLIVER 'S name , DEREK stiffens . PENGO has an instinct against talking to OLIVER in front of DEREK . He knows OLIVER is a sore point with DEREK ) Tell him I 'll call him back . ( He hangs up ) p. 72 DEREK PENGO Dad , I 've never asked a favor of you before LORD PENGO Well ? DEREK PENGO Fire Oliver . I beg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oliver ? DEREK PENGO Because he 's a cynical opportunist . LORD PENGO Life 's full of ' em . Same might be said of me . Has been . DEREK PENGO Oliver 's not a good influence . He 'll never make Primrose happy . I feel it . LORD PENGO You 're nave , Derek . You do n't know these people . They want romance . They want happiness and they do n't know how to get it . They want love . DEREK PENGO ( Scornfully ) Love ! LORD PENGO Do you know what misery Primrose endured when she was married to Drury ? I do . If Oliver gives her something to live for , if he makes her happy , then he 's saving her . What 's your objection to it ? DEREK PENGO Why do you have to mix in the private lives of your clients ? LORD PENGO Because there 's no other way . You forget , Derek , I am an outsider fighting rivals who have been entrenched for generations . I have to invent my own means , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll follow it . ( FILBERT comes in ) p. 73 FILBERT ( Announces ) Mr. Sylvester Schmitt . LORD PENGO ( Overjoyed and incredulous , but concealing it  --  casually to FILBERT ) Oh ? I have no appointment with Mr. Schmitt . FILBERT ' E apologizes for comin ' without an appointment , but ' e says it 's an emergency , my Lord . LORD PENGO Tell him I 'll see him in a minute , Filbert . I am with an important client , but I 'll see him directly . I 'll buzz . FILBERT Yes , my Lord . ( FILBERT goes . The triumph of this softens PENGO immeasurably and sweeps his grievance out of his mind . He turns to DEREK , all tenderness ) LORD PENGO You see , Derek , I told you ! They need me ! They need me ! DEREK PENGO So do Mother and I , but we never seem to get you ! LORD PENGO If you 'll only be patient , both of you . Once my Grand Design goes through , I promise you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chteau in France ( With extravagant humor ) the Houses of Parliament . DEREK PENGO I have no doubt you 've put in a bid on them ! ( PENGO buzzes ) p. 74 LORD PENGO Want to stay and watch me operate on Mr. Schmitt ? DEREK PENGO I 'm afraid I 'll cramp your style . LORD PENGO ( Quizzical ) Perhaps you would . ( As DEREK goes he passes the Settignano little girl . His hand caresses it ) DEREK PENGO She is beautiful . Mother will love her . ( He goes out . FILBERT ushers in SYLVESTER SCHMITT . SCHMITT is a large , towheaded bear of a man , about sixty , very phlegmatic ; he moves lumberingly , as if even sitting down were a kind of commitment ) LORD PENGO ( Moves forward to greet him ) Mr. Schmitt ! I am delighted to see you . Wo n't you sit down ? SYLVESTER SCHMITT Just going to stay a minute . LORD PENGO ( Moves up a chair ) Why not be comfortable for that minute ? SYLVESTER SCHMITT Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) LORD PENGO I said I 'd hold those glorious masterpieces you looked at the other day . I have kept my promise . p. 75 SYLVESTER SCHMITT Told you last time , Lord Pengo , not interested . Unless LORD PENGO There can be no change in the price I gave you . SYLVESTER SCHMITT Then forget about it . I came about something else . LORD PENGO You know , Mr. Schmitt , those works of art I showed you are beyond price . You are businessman enough to know , that no matter what you pay for the priceless , you 're getting it cheap . SYLVESTER SCHMITT Do n't want any bargains that cost that kind of money . I work for my money , Lord Pengo ! LORD PENGO ( Easily ) Do you suggest that I do n't ? Do you think these works of art are easy to come by ? Often they have to be pried away by main strength . It takes constant vigilance  --  and a great deal of capital  --  to acquire them . You get them only because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye catches the Renaissance throne ) What 's that fancy chair ? LORD PENGO Not for sale . SYLVESTER SCHMITT ( Grumpy ) Then what 's it doing here ? In my stores , when I put things in the window , what would my customers say if I told them they were not for sale when they went in to buy them ? p. 76 LORD PENGO ( With quiet grandeur ) The throne is not in a window , Mr. Schmitt . ( He has taken a box of Havanas from his desk and now offers SCHMITT one ) Cigar ? SYLVESTER SCHMITT Do n't smoke . ( A silence ) LORD PENGO How 's business , Mr. Schmitt ? SYLVESTER SCHMITT My business is always good . LORD PENGO You are a lucky man . So many Americans complain to me about the depression . Even Phineas D. Terwilliger the other day was telling me  --  SYLVESTER SCHMITT No matter how poor people are they 've always got ten cents . I never charge more than ten cents . LORD PENGO That is why , perhaps , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a suspicious look ) What ? LORD PENGO Just a little joke . SYLVESTER SCHMITT ( Wistfully ) Joke . My wife tells me I got no sense of humor . LORD PENGO I 'm sure she 's wrong about that . ( A pause ) p. 77 SYLVESTER SCHMITT ( Finally ) Fact is  --  that 's why I came here  --  on account of my wife . LORD PENGO Really ? SYLVESTER SCHMITT We had a little fight . LORD PENGO That happens . SYLVESTER SCHMITT Would n't call it a fight exactly . Misunderstanding . More of a misunderstanding . LORD PENGO Sometimes , Mr. Schmitt , those are worse than fights . SYLVESTER SCHMITT Yeah . Kind of makes me uncomfortable . LORD PENGO I know what you mean . I quite sympathize . Fact is  --  I am in exactly the same position at this moment  --  with my wife . SYLVESTER SCHMITT Really ? LORD PENGO Afraid to go home  --  if you must know the truth . SYLVESTER SCHMITT ( Gaining comfort by the instant ) Really ? LORD PENGO I assure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PENGO I 'll consult my calendar . ( Looks at his desk ) My wife 's giving a party at the Opera . p. 78 SYLVESTER SCHMITT ( Disappointed ) Too bad ! LORD PENGO The Opera bores me . SYLVESTER SCHMITT Ever hear a Burton Holmes Travelogue ? LORD PENGO No . I 've often wanted to . SYLVESTER SCHMITT Wonderful slides . Colored . LORD PENGO Must be fascinating . SYLVESTER SCHMITT Want to go with me tonight ? I got two tickets  --  way down front . LORD PENGO Delighted . SYLVESTER SCHMITT It 's going to be especially good tonight  --  it 's the Holy Land ! LORD PENGO That should be very uplifting . SYLVESTER SCHMITT Just what I thought . And I need to be uplifted . Will you have dinner with me ? LORD PENGO Afraid I ca n't do that . SYLVESTER SCHMITT Then meet me at Carnegie Hall . In the lobby . Eight-thirty . LORD PENGO I shall be there . ( A pause ) Anything else I can do for you ? SYLVESTER SCHMITT Well , I thought if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little present  --  for my wife ? p. 79 LORD PENGO We 're in the same boat , are n't we ? Just what I 'm doing for my wife . SYLVESTER SCHMITT ( Eagerly ) What are you getting your wife ? LORD PENGO ( Goes to the Settignano ) This lovely little girl by Settignano . SYLVESTER SCHMITT Who ? LORD PENGO Florentine sculptor . Fifteenth century . Pupil of Donatello . Famous for his exquisite sculptures of women and children . Is n't she adorable ? SYLVESTER SCHMITT ( Suddenly greedy ) My wife always wanted a girl . LORD PENGO So did mine . SYLVESTER SCHMITT My wife would like that . LORD PENGO So would mine . ( His hand caresses the little girl tenderly ) Look , Mr. Schmitt , this child is five hundred years old  --  and how fresh she is , how lit-up she is , how delicate , how eternally lovely she is . SYLVESTER SCHMITT ( Breaks into PENGO 'S reverie ) Listen , Pengo , what do you want for her ? LORD PENGO Sorry . Not for sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife ( He walks him to the sky-lighted gallery at the back and stands impressively before Sir Joshua Reynolds ' Mrs. Siddons as the Tragic Muse ) Here is Sir Joshua Reynolds ' portrait of Mrs. Siddons. p. 80 SYLVESTER SCHMITT Who 's Mrs. Siddons ? LORD PENGO ( Gently ) The greatest English actress of the eighteenth century . SYLVESTER SCHMITT Matilda would n't like that . LORD PENGO Why not ? SYLVESTER SCHMITT She would n't care to have me bring home an actress . She might think I 'm playing around . LORD PENGO ( Moves away from Mrs. Siddons and stands before the Maria Theresa of Van Dyck ) Does Mrs. Schmitt 's prejudice extend to queens ? Here is Henrietta Maria by Van Dyck  --  the greatest Van Dyck I have ever owned the best example of the great man at his best period . SYLVESTER SCHMITT ( Skeptically ) What makes it great ? LORD PENGO The greatness of the artist . Look at it . Did you ever see such ravishing color ? SYLVESTER SCHMITT Matilda 's color-blind . LORD PENGO Van Dyck will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should present your queen  --  with another queen ? SYLVESTER SCHMITT My wife 's no queen . And she 's color-blind . And she always wanted a little girl . We 're childless , Lord Pengo . ( Goes back to the Settignano ) How much ? p. 81 LORD PENGO Not for sale . SYLVESTER SCHMITT ( Suddenly obsessed ) I 've got to get her for my wife ! LORD PENGO I have already promised her to mine . SYLVESTER SCHMITT Give your wife the Van Dyck . LORD PENGO ( Smiles ) Ca n't afford it . The Henrietta Maria is expensive . SYLVESTER SCHMITT If I buy this this LORD PENGO ( Supplies ) Settignano SYLVESTER SCHMITT Yeah . If I buy her you 'll be able to give the Van Dyck to your wife . How much is the Van Dyck ? LORD PENGO Four hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars . You see , Mr. Schmitt , you 'd have to buy several Settignanos . SYLVESTER SCHMITT ( In outrage ) Your prices , Pengo ! LORD PENGO They are , I admit , Pengo prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pengo masterpieces . SYLVESTER SCHMITT Do you realize how many egg cups I have to sell to get four hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars ? p. 82 LORD PENGO I have absolute confidence in your ability to sell them . ( He leads him to the Masaccio ) Now here is a Masaccio . Bernard Berenson says it is an absolute masterpiece . SYLVESTER SCHMITT What is it ? LORD PENGO It is called The Circumcision . SYLVESTER SCHMITT I do n't like pictures of operations . ( Looks longingly at Settignano ) How much for this little girl ? LORD PENGO ( Improvising ) One hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars . SYLVESTER SCHMITT I 'll give you a hundred . Wrap her up and let me take her home . With her I can go home ! LORD PENGO Sorry . SYLVESTER SCHMITT ( Desperate ) You got so much stuff here  --  ca n't you give your wife something else ? LORD PENGO I might say the same of you . A thousand stores  --  have n't you got something in one of those thousand stores ? SYLVESTER SCHMITT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , Mr. Schmitt , that is precisely where it differs from my merchandise ! p. 83 SYLVESTER SCHMITT ( Suffering ) One hundred and twenty-five thousand . LORD PENGO I implore you , for the sake of my domestic happiness , do not overpay me for this little Settignano . I implore you . Without her , I must confess to you , I wo n't dare go home . SYLVESTER SCHMITT You do n't have to go home . I 'm taking you to the Holy Land . LORD PENGO Even from the Holy Land , one must eventually return . Unless you are a Crusader , which I am not . SYLVESTER SCHMITT One hundred and fifty . LORD PENGO I do n't want you to buy this , Mr. Schmitt . It would embarrass me greatly if you did . It would depress me . SYLVESTER SCHMITT ( Vindictively ) There 's something about you , Lord Pengo LORD PENGO Yes , Mr. Schmitt ? SYLVESTER SCHMITT that would make me very happy to depress you ! LORD PENGO Do n't see why you are vindictive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SYLVESTER SCHMITT ( At his wit 's end ) I pay cash . Any reduction for cash ? p. 84 LORD PENGO None whatever . You see , Mr. Schmitt , I am not short of cash . Are you ? ( SCHMITT glares at him , takes a fountain pen and a checkbook out of his pocket and scribbles a check ) SYLVESTER SCHMITT Wrap her up . ( PENGO buzzes . FILBERT comes in ) LORD PENGO Mr. Schmitt has acquired this little Settignano . Will you take her down to Grandison please ? ( FILBERT lifts the head tenderly and starts to walk out with it ) SYLVESTER SCHMITT ( Offers the check to PENGO ) Here you are , Pengo . Look at it . LORD PENGO ( Waves the check aside disdainfully ) I believe I can trust you to make out a check , Mr. Schmitt . Filbert , will you take Mr. Schmitt 's check please and give it to Vickers ? ( FILBERT takes SCHMITT 'S check and goes ) SYLVESTER SCHMITT ( Aghast ) What have I done ? LORD PENGO You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SYLVESTER SCHMITT ( Lumbers up to his feet ) Carnegie Hall . Eight-thirty. p. 85 LORD PENGO I look forward to it . You are very adroit , Mr. Schmitt . You see , you are able to go home  --  I am not ! SYLVESTER SCHMITT ( Bitterly , as he goes ) If anybody needs a trip to the Holy Land  --  you do ! ( The moment he is gone , PENGO executes a little pas de seul . He buzzes DEREK 'S buzzer . DEREK comes back ) LORD PENGO ( Full of glee ) Derek ! You should have stayed  --  you should have stayed ! What do you think I 'm doing tonight ? Mr. Schmitt is taking me to Burton Holmes . DEREK PENGO I thought we were going to the Opera . LORD PENGO I leave it to you to explain to Mother . DEREK PENGO I am sure you do . LORD PENGO By the way , Derek , something else I 'd like you to do for me ( He is a little abashed and shamefaced by this one ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , there 's a good fellow , and get something lovely for your mother . I rely on your taste absolutely . Tell her I got it and sent it by you . p. 86 DEREK PENGO Cartier 's I thought ( He looks for the Settignano , understands all ) Dad ! You did n't ! LORD PENGO ( Rueful ) I did n't . Schmitt did ! ( DEREK looks at him ; his father looks so contrite he has to laugh ) DEREK PENGO I hope you have n't already promised the Settignano to Mother . I hope she does n't know about it ! LORD PENGO Unfortunately , I did and she does . That 's the trouble with me  --  too impulsive ! DEREK PENGO Did you have to ? Did you really have to ? This is the sort of thing you 're always doing to Mother ! LORD PENGO What can I do , Derek ? I 'm weak . And you know what these fellows are  --  so dictatorial . They badger me till I give in ! ( He gives DEREK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is the due of the persecuted . DEREK almost gives it to him . PENGO puts his arm around DEREK 'S shoulder and starts with him out of the room ) The lights dim p. 87 Act 2 , Scene 2 ACT TWOSCENE 2 Scene : At PENGO 'S . Same afternoon . At rise : ENOCH DRURY 'S elegant figure is moving from masterpiece to masterpiece , examining critically . PENGO is allowing DRURY to discover things for himself . LORD PENGO You are the one client , Mr. Drury , who makes my job easy . I do n't have to show you anything . You have your own eye . ENOCH DRURY ( Coldly ) Thank you . ( Just before he leaves the Van Dyck ) A quite fine Van Dyck . ( He moves on to Mrs. Siddons ) Reynolds . Very good . If I were collecting eighteenth-century English , I should acquire this . LORD PENGO Your taste , if I may say so , is impeccable . ENOCH DRURY ( Dryly ) I am quite aware , when you say that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not afford , if I am to supply you , to be less than impeccable . ENOCH DRURY ( Moving to the Masaccio ) My eye does n't tell me what this is . LORD PENGO Masaccio . Berenson calls it a masterpiece . The Circumcision . p. 88 ENOCH DRURY I am not interested in Jewish rites . ( Thinks perhaps this is tactless ) No offense , your Lordship . LORD PENGO Not at all . I understand prejudice . I have a few of my own . But Berenson says of this little picture  --  ENOCH DRURY Too dark . I like bright colors . ( He stands before the throne ) Renaissance ? LORD PENGO Lorenzo de Medici 's throne . ( Warms up ) It fires the imagination , does n't it ? There he sat , the magnificent Lorenzo ; his captains reported to him , the admirals of his fleets . He dispensed largesse and justice  --  artist and ruler . You , Mr. Drury , are his spiritual descendant  --  a prince of the Renaissance , misplaced in time . ENOCH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were lucky . ( With a wave toward the chair ) Lorenzo was lucky . ( With pensive reverie ) What a wonderful time he must have had ! Those fellows  --  when they did n't like anybody , they just murdered them . No one thought anything about it . While I  --  You 've seen the papers ? LORD PENGO ( He has seen them ) I do n't get time to read the papers . p. 89 ENOCH DRURY Full of denunciation of me . Why ? Because I was forced to call in strike-breakers to protect my property at my steel mills  --  which I had every right to do . I am disliked . I feel hostility around me . LORD PENGO Price of greatness . ENOCH DRURY I have done as much as any man to develop the industrial might of this country . I am denounced as a monopolist . I am . Monopoly is the course of evolution . I know more about the inner mechanism which makes this country tick than anybody alive . And yet  --  when I run for office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ENOCH DRURY That is true . You are not a fool , Pengo . LORD PENGO Thank you . That is a compliment that can be paid to very few members of the House of Lords . ( DRURY smiles frostily ) ENOCH DRURY You are an amusing fellow . You are one of the very few I know  --  who entertains me . I do n't make friends easily ; why is it that I feel free to talk to you ? LORD PENGO Perhaps it is because we are not equals . ENOCH DRURY After all , you are a member of the British House of Lords ! p. 90 LORD PENGO I find that useful with the run of my American clients . It does not impress you ! ENOCH DRURY ( With a wan smile ) I know England . I know how you wangled it ! LORD PENGO ( With a chuckle ) You know because I told you ! ENOCH DRURY So you did ! And a very funny story it was ! The English are incorruptible , are n't they ? You ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them a check . ( PENGO laughs . DRURY goes on  --  with bitter sarcasm ) And what about that exquisite connoisseur , Walter Cannon Brink ? Is he buying anything ? LORD PENGO He 's building a house . ENOCH DRURY Is that because I am building one ? LORD PENGO Possibly . ENOCH DRURY He imitates me in everything . Because I married Primrose , he wanted her . Because I started collecting , he did . LORD PENGO In this mimicry  --  I encourage him . ENOCH DRURY I am sure you do . ( Command to a court jester ) I love your stories , Pengo . Tell me one . LORD PENGO ( Slips into the role easily ) Well , just a few years ago , in London p. 91 ENOCH DRURY Yes ? LORD PENGO The Duke of Lowtower  --  very High Church  --  asked me to look at an old master he was considering buying from Wellnew . ENOCH DRURY Yes ? LORD PENGO " Very fine , your Grace , " I said . " Very fine . But I suppose you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old boy bristled and sent it back to Wellnew 's like a shot . ENOCH DRURY Well , you killed a sale for Wellnew LORD PENGO I did more than that , Mr. Drury . ENOCH DRURY Did you ? LORD PENGO I acquired the picture and on those perverse cherubs I performed a remarkable feat of therapy . ENOCH DRURY Did you restore the cherubs to normalcy ? LORD PENGO Completely . Complete cure . ENOCH DRURY How ? LORD PENGO By selling them to Phineas D. Terwilliger , in whose presence nobody could be perverse , and by doubling the price . ENOCH DRURY ( Amused ) Serves Terwilliger right  --  pompous ass . What an odd lot you deal with , Lord Pengo ! p. 92 LORD PENGO They are positively quaint ! ( A moment ; DRURY gets up to go ) ENOCH DRURY Thank you very much , Lord Pengo , for a diverting half-hour . LORD PENGO Before you go , Mr. Drury  --  ENOCH DRURY Yes ? LORD PENGO There is something very close to my heart  --  about which I have been meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DRURY ( On guard ) Yes ? LORD PENGO We are getting on , Mr. Drury , both of us . We do n't live forever . ENOCH DRURY Sometimes that thought is a comfort . LORD PENGO I have a Grand Design which will outwit mortality . ENOCH DRURY Do n't tell me you are going into patent medicines ! LORD PENGO The pictures . It concerns the ultimate destiny of the pictures . ENOCH DRURY What about them ? LORD PENGO My idea is that you should endow a National Gallery of Art in this country  --  a counterpart of the National Gallery in London which you so admire . That your collection  --  when we have completed it  --  should be the first tenant of the Gallery , which indeed it would deserve to be . p. 93 ENOCH DRURY Sounds like an expensive project . LORD PENGO Not too expensive for you , Mr. Drury . It will transform the hostility which surrounds you into gratitude . It will link your name eternally with the great artists . We pass . They go on . You will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ museum model  --  puts his hand on it ) Here is a model of the gallery made by the greatest of your architects . ENOCH DRURY ( With irony ) It is very generous of you , Lord Pengo , to give me the opportunity of endowing a gift of such magnitude . LORD PENGO You have done so much for your country already . It will be a monument forever . What panache ! Princely tip to posterity . ( With a wave toward the throne ) He 'd have done it . Lorenzo would have done it . In fact he did . ENOCH DRURY ( His voice rises ) Lorenzo was master of his destiny . He was n't persecuted as I am ! ( PENGO waits . DRURY gets control of himself , resumes in his normal voice ) The final irony . The government in Washington  --  the government for which I have done so much  --  is about to institute a tax suit against me , for over ten million dollars . p. 94 LORD PENGO That seems ungrateful . ENOCH DRURY That man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenge on me  --  for not supporting him . He has a genial smile , Mr. Roosevelt , but in his soul he is vindictive . LORD PENGO ( Lightly , this is just what he wants ; taps the model ) You know , Mr. Drury , the endowment I suggest might make this princely gift economical as well as generous . Circumvent oblivion and the collector of internal revenue at one stroke . ENOCH DRURY ( After a moment , thinking hard ) How ? LORD PENGO If you propose  --  and I shall be happy to testify in your tax suit that you have always proposed it  --  to give all your pictures to the nation , think what it will do for you , Mr. Drury . Your collection will be worth at least one hundred million dollars . How can even this administration have the effrontery to suggest that a man who has been striving to give away to the people a hundred million dollars has been simultaneously trying to rob them of ten ? ( This makes a deep impression on DRURY . He sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model again and looks at it with a new eye . PENGO presses his advantage ) I do not mean to compare myself to you , Mr. Drury . No one is more aware  --  we are worlds apart . But one thing we do have in common  --  the climate . It is changing , Mr. Drury , and I have foreseen for a long time that it is changing . p. 95 ENOCH DRURY You are right . The climate is changing . Income and inheritance taxes  --  legalized confiscation . ( With bitter contempt ) The welfare state ! In a world where everything is going to belong to everybody , I sha n't really care to live . LORD PENGO ( Comforts him ) There 'll always be somebody to monopolize the welfare  --  corner the market in good will ! ENOCH DRURY What a revolting idea ! ( Stares at the throne ) That throne ! An anachronism . This is no time for thrones ! LORD PENGO ( Smoothly ) It will have a historic interest for those who visit your gallery . They will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it . ( A pause . DRURY sits staring , fascinated by the throne . PENGO keeps looking at DRURY ) When I first came to this country I observed what people like you were doing : in steel , in coal , in oil , in technology , in corporate finance . Mighty , unparalleled , imperial . To me it was a fantastic opera for which I was prepared to provide an expensive but imperishable setting . This opera  --  as you and your colleagues played it , Mr. Drury  --  is just about over . But you are lucky ( DRURY looks up at him , sharply ) You own Titians and Raphaels , Botticellis and Giorgiones  --  they are linked with your name . You will find them valuable , Mr. Drury , as contemporary as well as eternal pals . ( DRURY says nothing . He sits , lost in a brown study ) You are lucky . You will have their companionship in heaven as you have it now on earth . Who will I have ? ( PENGO decides it is a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has said has sunk in . As he goes , casually ) By the way  --  Scotus Slemp died without buying the Raphael Alba Madonna . She belongs in your collection , Mr. Drury . If you will excuse me for a moment , I 'll go down to arrange to have her sent to you . ( PENGO goes out . DRURY sits . It has grown somewhat dark in the room . Finally DRURY , still in a kind of trance , gets up . He looks at his watch . Decides to go . His eye catches the throne again . He moves toward it , pauses . As if by a kind of automatism , he goes up to the steps that lead to the throne , gives a guilty look around to see that he is not being observed , and then sidles into the imperial seat ) p. 96 ENOCH DRURY ( Safely seated , he muses out loud , involuntarily , as if transported over the centuries by the grandeur and antiquity of the chair ) Renaissance prince misplaced misplaced in time The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TWOSCENE 3 Scene : The same . Several hours later . It is snowing outside on this late fall afternoon . The lights are lit , soft radiance on the pictures from electroliers . At rise : MISS SWANSON is at her desk going over invoices . VICKERS , the accountant , comes in . He carries a cable in his hand . He is fit to be tied . VICKERS ( Shouts ) I tell you , Miss Swanson , I ca n't stand it any more ! MISS SWANSON I know how you feel . And yet you do . We all do . VICKERS Read this cable from London ! ( He gives MISS SWANSON the cable . She reads it , whistles faintly , but is calm . She returns it to VICKERS ) MISS SWANSON Well , as he left an unlimited order at Christie 's , what do you expect ? VICKERS He could have gone partners with Wellnew and got it for a third . MISS SWANSON Lord Pengo does n't like to go partners . VICKERS ( Taps the cable ) Three hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pinkie ! p. 98 VICKERS Why , he sold it himself four years ago for a hundred . Who on earth does he think he can sell it to at this figure  --  to say nothing of a profit ? I tell you , Miss Swanson , it 's insane . MISS SWANSON ( Wearily ) I have often suggested to Lord Pengo a motto for our front door : " Abandon sanity , all ye who enter here ! " ( PENGO comes in . He is full of beans ) LORD PENGO Just been having tea with Mrs. Bovington . With Mrs. Bovington I have exactly the same relation that Disraeli had with Queen Victoria . And there is considerable resemblance . MISS SWANSON Between you and Disraeli ? LORD PENGO No , between Mrs. Bovington and Victoria . Mrs. B. is taller . But the same hats ! ( Sees VICKERS stewing ) What 's up , Vickers ? VICKERS ( With the heaviest sarcasm ) I congratulate you , Lord Pengo ! LORD PENGO That 's unusual . What about ? VICKERS ( Same voice ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Really ! How much ? ( VICKERS hands him the cable . PENGO takes it in at a glance ) Damn that Wellnew . A cabal a conspiracy p. 99 VICKERS Three hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars ! For a picture everybody knows you sold yourself for a hundred . You 'll never get rid of it  --  not at that figure . You 'll never sell it at a profit  --  not possibly . LORD PENGO ( Quietly ) I do n't want a profit . VICKERS Are we in business for love ? LORD PENGO ( Teasing him ) In a way VICKERS You 'll have to sell it at a loss . LORD PENGO No matter what I sell it for  --  if I give it away  --  it wo n't be a loss . VICKERS Is this a riddle ? LORD PENGO Terwilliger wants this picture . He asked Wellnew to get it for him . I have to teach Terwilliger that if he wants a great picture he can only get it from me ! They 've got to learn that  --  all of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in mine ! MISS SWANSON ( Dryly ) Get it , Vickers ? ( She goes out ) VICKERS ( With passion ) Lord Pengo , you do n't seem to realize I have to find three million dollars for the City Trust Bank tomorrow and I have n't got it . You promised me two million from Slemp . I wo n't mince words , my Lord  --  you face bankruptcy . p. 100 LORD PENGO ( Quietly ) Get an extension . VICKERS I 've gotten one . I ca n't get another . It 's a short-term note . It 's up tomorrow . ( PENGO goes to his desk ) LORD PENGO ( At the phone ) Get Mr. McKenna , manager of the Drury Trust Company , Drury , Illinois . Mr. Vickers calling . ( He hangs up ) When Mr. McKenna calls , ask him for a three-million-dollar credit for sixty days . Mr. Drury has more than that amount of my stuff in his house right now . Tell him to call the City Trust to inform them that he is sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have two houses building in New York , Vickers ; for Mrs. Drury and Mr. Brink . I shall ask Mr. Brink and Mrs. Drury to give me advances to cover the Drury draft within sixty days . That will make the Drury Trust happy . Will it make you happy ? VICKERS This job is getting to be a headache ! LORD PENGO You lack faith , Vickers . ( JOHNSON comes in ) JOHNSON Mrs. Enoch Drury . LORD PENGO Show her in , Johnson . ( JOHNSON goes ) There ! You see , Vickers ! The first of my two houses . Feel better ? p. 101 VICKERS ( As he goes ) Except for my ulcer . ( VICKERS goes . PRIMROSE comes in . She has been crying and wears dark glasses to conceal it ) LORD PENGO My dear Primrose PRIMROSE DRURY ( Strained voice ) Hello , Joe . How 's every little thing ? LORD PENGO Why those glasses ? Eye trouble ? PRIMROSE DRURY Do n't want you to see my eyes , Joe They 're a sight LORD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter ? PRIMROSE DRURY Come to say good-bye to you , Joe . LORD PENGO ( Astonished ) Good-bye ? PRIMROSE DRURY Yes , Joe . LORD PENGO Sir William Fitzpatrick was here with the plans for your house . He 's got some marvelous plans , Prim . A colonnade it 'll be the only colonnade on Fifth Avenue . PRIMROSE DRURY ( Flatly ) Not building the house , Joe . LORD PENGO This is n't like you , Prim ! What 's the matter ? p. 102 PRIMROSE DRURY Just about everything . I 'm sailin ' to Europe tomorrow . For good . Not comin ' back . Luckily , my analyst , Dr. Auerbach , is coming along . To keep me from jumpin ' overboard , I guess . LORD PENGO ( Genuinely concerned ) What 's happened ? ( A silence ) Primrose , I 'm your friend . House or no house  --  I 'm your friend . You know that . PRIMROSE DRURY That 's why I came , Joe  --  to tell you . Derek does n't know  --  you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark  --  PRIMROSE DRURY So am I. In front of you , I guess , I can take these glasses off . ( She takes them off ) I 'm still in the dark . ( Pitifully ) I feel as if  --  kinda  --  ( She laughs ) You always said I had a sunny nature , Joe . LORD PENGO And so you have . The sunniest I know . PRIMROSE DRURY Feel as if  --  I 'll always be in the dark . LORD PENGO Nonsense , I wo n't allow it ! I love you , Prim . You are very dear to me . Of all my clients  --  Derek knows it  --  everyone knows it  --  you are the only one for whom I feel  --  affection . Tell your friend Joe . p. 103 PRIMROSE DRURY I know you meant well LORD PENGO I ca n't help you , darling , if you do n't tell me what it is ! PRIMROSE DRURY ( Tries to be flippant ) My romance , Joe , my beautiful romance  --  well , Joe , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the rocks , Joe . Poor Derek . I tell you , Joe , my heart breaks for Derek . LORD PENGO ( In a terrible voice ; an intimation of the disaster begins to break on him ) Oliver  --  you do n't mean that Oliver ? PRIMROSE DRURY Yes , Joe . That 's just what I mean . He liked me for a time but I guess he kinda prefers Daphne . LORD PENGO ( Stunned ) Daphne  --  she 's half his age ! PRIMROSE DRURY I caught ' em , Joe  --  how do they call it  --  in  --  in  --  I never can think of those funny foreign words you catch people in . ( A silence ) LORD PENGO I 'll kill him . I 'll break him . PRIMROSE DRURY ( Whose common sense never deserts her ) What good 'll that do ? Will it put the pieces together for me ? ( A moment . He stares at her , fighting to control his rage ; if OLIVER were there at that moment he would break him in two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Tell Enoch he can have his divorce . Ai n't gonner stand in his way any more . What for ? It 's selfish . p. 104 LORD PENGO I 'll kill him  --  I 'll destroy that swine . PRIMROSE DRURY ( Gravely  --  even with humor ) Daphne 'd never forgive you for that . Heigh-ho . Easy come , easy go . Eh , Joe ? LORD PENGO That nothing ! That lightweight  --  when I think what I 've done for him ! PRIMROSE DRURY Have you , Joe ? What have you done for him ? ( DEREK has come in , he overhears . He is very tense , eroded ) DEREK PENGO Tell Primrose , Father , what you 've done for Mr. Oliver ! PRIMROSE DRURY Hello , Derek . DEREK PENGO Hello , Prim . PRIMROSE DRURY ( Automatically ) Well , Derek , how 's every little thing ? LORD PENGO It seems absurd to me , dear Primrose , that on account of an elegant gutter-type like Oliver DEREK PENGO He 's a gutter-type , is he ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How comes it , Father , with all your exalted connections , you have time also for gutter-types ? p. 105 PRIMROSE DRURY ( Acutely ; looks at Derek ) Guess you know the score , eh , Derek ? DEREK PENGO Yes , Prim . I know the score . Daphne just told me . PRIMROSE DRURY Do n't be hard on her , Derek . DEREK PENGO Whether I am hard on her or not will make very little difference to Daphne ! PRIMROSE DRURY Poor kid ! She never had a chance . My fault . Enoch 's fault . Just look at the life she 's had  --  the childhood she 's had ! Why , when she was six years old  --  right after Enoch left me , and I was takin ' her abroad to get away from it all  --  Enoch 's detectives kidnaped her right off the gangplank . So I did n't sail and my detectives kidnaped her right back . ( She laughs ) I remember Daphne 's photograph all over the yellows . I have to laugh  --  just rememberin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She traces with her fingers big letters ) Bone of contention . Poor Daphne , can you imagine  --  at the age of six  --  bein ' a bone of contention ? ( A moment ; she appeals to Derek ) Do n't be hard on Daphne , Derek . Maybe she 'll get over it ! ( Another moment of silence . PENGO realizes what a debacle this is  --  he is thinking hard ) Well , guess there 's nothing much more to say . I 'm sailin ' tomorrow , Derek . p. 106 LORD PENGO ( A last plea ) Wait ! Why do n't you wait ? Give yourself time . PRIMROSE DRURY Ca n't wait . My analyst 's a very busy man . I had to talk him into taking his vacation now . He 's got a bit of a crush on me , I think . Had to threaten suicide if he would n't . LORD PENGO Prim ! PRIMROSE DRURY Not that I ever would commit suicide . Something about doin ' that that 's in poor taste , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daphne might blame herself and that would n't be fair to Daphne . ( As she passes DEREK ) ' Bye , Derek . DEREK PENGO Good-bye , Prim . Bon voyage ! PRIMROSE DRURY ( A moment ; she turns to PENGO ) Kiss me good-bye , Joe  --  just to show there 's no hard feelin 's about the house . ( PENGO goes to her , kisses her . She turns and makes for the door swiftly . As she is on the verge of tears she whips her dark glasses on . PRIMROSE goes . The moment she is gone PENGO rushes to the phone ) LORD PENGO ( In a terrible voice ) I 'll kill him ! DEREK PENGO ( Quietly ) I would n't do that , Father . p. 107 LORD PENGO I 'll kill him ! I 'll break him ! DEREK PENGO You ca n't do that . LORD PENGO Ca n't I ? DEREK PENGO You forget  --  he has Daphne . You engaged him to work on Primrose . Well , he worked on Daphne . She 's now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? LORD PENGO ( Wounded . He puts the receiver down , sits at desk  --  for a moment , defeated ) That 's not fair , Derek . DEREK PENGO Is n't it ? Miss Swanson says that for you selling is a disembodied activity  --  like praying . Well , with Oliver cozily married to Daphne , he can bring you votive offerings , ca n't he ? ( With bitterness ) You can continue to pray ! ( PENGO gets up , faces DEREK ; he is in a rage ) LORD PENGO You sit in judgment on me ! You are my son  --  for whom I have planned everything  --  to whom I am going to leave everything  --  and you sit in judgment on me ! DEREK PENGO I begged you not to engage Oliver . I begged you . LORD PENGO You 're mooning over that spoiled little nymphomaniac Daphne . I always felt she 'd be no good for you . p. 108 DEREK PENGO It 's beyond that . LORD PENGO Is it ? DEREK PENGO Yes . It 's beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond that . LORD PENGO Is it ? DEREK PENGO It 's the way you do business , your methods , messing up people 's lives , throwing everything into the cashbox  --  friendship , family , everything . Engaging gigolos to woo them into building houses which you can furnish  --  I want no part of it . LORD PENGO ( Dangerously ) Really ? DEREK PENGO I am leaving , Father . LORD PENGO Where for , may I ask ? DEREK PENGO To Europe  --  possibly to Africa . LORD PENGO To do what , may I ask ? DEREK PENGO To paint . LORD PENGO What makes you think you 've got talent ? DEREK PENGO I can only try . LORD PENGO What about your mother ? DEREK PENGO I 've told her . She sympathizes . I go with her blessing . LORD PENGO What sort of painting ? These modern abstractionist daubs I suppose ? Those Freudian nightmares in paint . p. 109 DEREK PENGO We are not serene any more , Father . ( He points to the old masters on the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way they did . LORD PENGO I 'm afraid not . DEREK PENGO We 'll be better friends if we are separated . ( A silence . PENGO feels he has an advantage  --  he begins to woo DEREK ) LORD PENGO In the first place you take these people  --  and their tribulations  --  much too seriously . DEREK PENGO I thought you were fond of Primrose LORD PENGO I adore her . How could you help it ? DEREK PENGO Supposing she knew that Oliver is in your employ ? That you engaged him to help you sell her the furnishing of a house ? LORD PENGO What 's the harm in that ? DEREK PENGO You see no harm in it ? You see what it 's done to her . To say nothing of what it 's done to me ! LORD PENGO What 's it done to her ? These people are swayed by every emotional whim  --  they 're rich enough to gratify every caprice . When something bothers them , there 's always Europe , there 's always their analysts . Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives some direction , some shape , some significance  --  through art  --  through beauty . If it were n't for me they would n't know what to do with themselves . p. 110 DEREK PENGO Your gift for justifying yourself is really remarkable . It really is ! LORD PENGO It 's the objective that counts , Derek . In my objective I am disinterested . Will it be remembered what I did and how I did it ? What is important  --  if my plan comes through  --  is that they ( He gestures toward the paintings ) the pure , the innocent , the immortal  --  will find a home there ( He points to the model ) for generations yet unborn . Do you grudge me this dream ? Do you grudge me my final absolution  --  this , yes , this wish to draw a mantle over myself to hide my sins ? ( A moment ; he adds dryly ) To say nothing of the sins of my clients . DEREK PENGO You 're very plausible . That argument has been used before you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I think so . In this case , yes . DEREK PENGO It 's always a special case . LORD PENGO You forget , Derek , I have n't had the advantages of your education . I 've had to make my way . I never studied abstract ethics at Oxford . DEREK PENGO ( Aloud , as if to himself ) The ache Primrose feels  --  the ache I feel  --  the ache Mother feels  --  p. 111 LORD PENGO ( Sharply ; this reaches him ) Do n't bring your mother into this ! Your mother and I are all right ! She loves me and I love her . There 's no cloud between us  --  not a shadow DEREK PENGO No shadow . No cloud . I said ache . LORD PENGO ( Points to the model ) Once this is completed , I 'll retire . Then your mother and I  --  you too if you like DEREK PENGO That perpetually receding some day  --  for how many years have we heard that ? LORD PENGO You must be patient a little longer . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient , Father . You have been  --  busy . You will go on being busy to the end . It 'll go on to the end ; your megaphoned buffooneries , butlers spying in houses , elegant scum like Oliver whispering inducements  --  all the dirty devices . LORD PENGO Be careful , Derek , be careful . DEREK PENGO I 'd better go . LORD PENGO ( Losing all control ) Go then . Good riddance . Go  --  go to Africa  --  go anywhere you like  --  paint your immature scrawls . See if you 'll have any luck selling them ! p. 112 DEREK PENGO Probably no luck . LORD PENGO I 've given you everything  --  done everything for you . DEREK PENGO Yes , you have . Everything you could . And the result is LORD PENGO I see the result . That you despise me . DEREK PENGO Worse than that , Father . It is myself I despise . LORD PENGO And with good reason ! ( There is a pause . They face each other , deadly enemies , and both devastated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason . Good-bye , Father . LORD PENGO Go then . Go and paint your silly pictures , but do n't come whining back to me when you find  --  as you surely will find  --  that nobody wants them . Once you leave  --  you leave ! DEREK PENGO That 's my intention . LORD PENGO Practice your lofty ethical standards in Africa . Elevate the natives ! Get out ! You depress me . Get out of my sight ! DEREK PENGO I will . You 'll be freer perhaps  --  with me out of the way . ( DEREK goes . PENGO is seething with rage ) p. 113 LORD PENGO ( Calls out ) Derek . I did n't mean it Derek , come back . ( No answer . PENGO gets up ; he is in a kind of convulsion of rage and frustration . He finds himself in front of the Masaccio . All his rage is vented suddenly against the Masaccio . He shouts ) Nobody wants it  --  nobody will buy it ! ( Obeying some dreadful compulsion he rips it off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes in ) MISS SWANSON ( Acutely distressed ) What happened between you and Derek ? He looked like a ghost . Would n't speak to me . ( Sees the picture on the floor ) I see that the Masaccio has suffered an accident ! LORD PENGO ( Fatalistically ) Something is happening around me . Something a conspiracy something ( FILBERT comes in ) FILBERT Wetmore just telephoned , my Lord . Mr. Drury requests that you take back the Allendale . LORD PENGO ( Very quiet ) Attend to that , Filbert . FILBERT Yes , my Lord . LORD PENGO ( To MISS SWANSON ) I expected that . It 's just as well . I 'll sell it to Terwilliger . ( To FILBERT ) Get me Walter Cannon Brink . Right away . ( FILBERT sits at the desk , takes up the phone . MISS SWANSON keeps staring at PENGO . She is full of compassion for him . To MISS SWANSON ) Primrose has given up the house . I wonder how that will affect Brink ? p. 114 FILBERT ( On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do , Miss Williams  --  Mr. Filbert speakin '  --  oh , you ' ave a message for Lord Pengo ? ( PENGO walks up and down , to get control , to think things out ) Thank you , Miss Williams . I will see that ' is Lordship gets the message . ( FILBERT hangs up . PENGO faces him ) LORD PENGO Well ? FILBERT Mr. Brink ' as left the city . ' E ' as changed ' is mind about buildin ' a ' ome in New York . ' E ' as instructed ' is lawyer to communicate with you , Lord Pengo . ( JOHNSON comes in ) JOHNSON I am afraid I have bad news , your Lordship . LORD PENGO Whenever you show your head it 's bad news , Johnson . I am developing an acute prejudice against your head . JOHNSON I am sorry , your Lordship . ( A moment ) LORD PENGO Well ? JOHNSON Word has just come . Phineas D. Terwilliger is dead . LORD PENGO That 's not possible . JOHNSON He was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something went wrong  --  had he been on land p. 115 LORD PENGO Two in one day . This begins to look like an epidemic ! ( A silence . PENGO speaks not to them , aloud to himself ) Something secret , something sinister  --  I feel it  --  growing in the dark around me . Do you feel it , Johnson ? JOHNSON In the midst of life we are in death . LORD PENGO There is something pious about you , Johnson , that I have never liked . JOHNSON Yes , my Lord . LORD PENGO That will be all . ( The two , JOHNSON and FILBERT , start out , greatly relieved . As they go : ) Do n't come in here unless you have something good to tell me . That means probably that I 'll never see either of you again  --  which is a mitigating circumstance . ( After FILBERT and JOHNSON go out there is a long silence ) MISS SWANSON ( Finally ; very moved  --  tender to him for once ) Quite a day , is n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dark  --  everything starts to crumble . MISS SWANSON ( Valedictory ) You 've had a good run , Joe . p. 116 LORD PENGO ( Gets up ; this rouses him ) If you think I 'm through , Miss Swanson , you 're very much mistaken . I have works of art that no one else in the world has . They 'll have to come to me for them  --  Drury , Brink , all of them . I admit I was shaken for a minute , but that 'll pass . ( His voice rises ) They 'll have to come to me  --  and they will  --  you hear  --  they will ! ( A moment ) Get me my wife on the telephone . ( MISS SWANSON goes to desk , dials ) MISS SWANSON ( On the telephone ) Lady Pengo ? This is Miss Swanson  --  Lord Pengo wants to speak to you . ( As PENGO goes to the phone , MISS SWANSON leaves the room ) LORD PENGO ( On the telephone , most tender and affectionate ) How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? That 's odd because I feel wonderfully well  --  quite exhilarated in fact Did Derek tell you I simply ca n't make the Opera tonight ? I have a dreary evening ahead of me , but I must go through with it I shall have my thoughts and they will be of you No , my dearest one , no , you are wrong , because at the back of everything is the thought of that day when there 'll just be you , whom I love very much indeed and , darling if you see Derek I had a few words with him  --  afraid I lost my temper a bit . He 's stubborn you know but give him my love not to you you have it Do n't wait for me . I have a long dreary evening ahead of me . A new client Sylvester Schmitt . He 's taking me to the Holy Land . Pray for me . Good night , my love . ( As he hangs up , the curtain falls ) @x Scene : The same as Act Two ; five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Aristotle Contemplating the Bust of Homer , at the moment covered by a red velvet drapery . The Masaccio is still where it was , and Mrs. Siddons still hangs in the gallery . At rise : MISS SWANSON is at her desk . She is carefully putting selected papers into LORD PENGO 'S open dispatch case . PRIMROSE comes in . MISS SWANSON rises to greet her . PRIMROSE DRURY Hello , Miss Swanson ! How 's every little thing ? MISS SWANSON Mrs. Auerbach ! I 've been expecting you . PRIMROSE DRURY When 's Joe sailing ? MISS SWANSON Tomorrow . You said on the telephone you had something to speak to me about . PRIMROSE DRURY Yes . I have . It 's really my husband 's idea ( She hesitates ) Dr. Auerbach is a great man , you know . He certainly pulled me out of the slough of despond . I 'd have been dead if not for him . ( Chuckles ) You know , Miss Swanson , his fees got to be so big I could n't afford him any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 119 MISS SWANSON ( Dead pan ) Does he now give you a rate , Mrs. Auerbach ? PRIMROSE DRURY Minute I married him , I did n't need him  --  professionally . ( A moment . MISS SWANSON is waiting ) It 's a bit touchy  --  what I want to speak to you about . MISS SWANSON You need have no hesitation . I am here to serve Lord Pengo 's friends . PRIMROSE DRURY It 's about Daphne . We got a problem with Daphne . Ever since that awful scandal with Mr. Oliver Daphne 's been so they call it disturbed that it 's got Jerome and me worried . MISS SWANSON I 'm sorry . PRIMROSE DRURY The thing is this . You know Daphne and Derek have been corresponding MISS SWANSON Yes , Mrs. Auerbach ? PRIMROSE DRURY ( Comes to MISS SWANSON anxiously ) If you sent for Derek . If Joe did . If you got Derek back here . Some trumped-up excuse . So it 'd seem casual . So they might begin seeing each other again . Do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence . PRIMROSE misunderstands her silence ) Do you think I 'm just plain nuts , Miss Swanson ? ( Her voice rises ) I 'm just about fit to be tied about Daphne p. 120 MISS SWANSON ( Finally , her voice is quiet but tense ) I do n't have to send for Derek , Mrs. Auerbach . I have already sent for him . Derek is here . PRIMROSE DRURY ( Amazed ) You do n't say ! MISS SWANSON Derek arrived this morning . I 'm expecting him now . PRIMROSE DRURY ( Looks at her shrewdly ) Why did you send for him ? MISS SWANSON For reasons of my own , Mrs. Auerbach ! PRIMROSE DRURY Does Joe know Derek is here ? MISS SWANSON Not yet . I wanted to surprise Lord Pengo . PRIMROSE DRURY ( Affected ) My God , Miss Swanson ! Is it as bad as that ? I know Joe has n't been feeling too good  --  but is it as bad as that ? MISS SWANSON I said , Mrs. Auerbach , for reasons of my own ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Swanson , I 'm not as dumb as I look . Is Joe as sick as all that ? Is there to be no more Joe ? MISS SWANSON Lord Pengo is very strong , Mrs. Auerbach . He 's tired . He just needs a little rest . p. 121 PRIMROSE DRURY ( Knows MISS SWANSON is lying ) If anything happened to Joe I do n't know life would n't be the same something 'd have gone out of it that you could n't get back for me anyway . ( A moment 's silence . DEREK walks in . He is older but looks sunburned and well . The London elegance has gone . He is now carelessly dressed , his tie askew . He feels emotion at seeing MISS SWANSON  --  does n't notice PRIMROSE for a moment ) MISS SWANSON Derek ! DEREK PENGO Miss Swanson ! ( He puts his arms around her , kisses her on the cheek  --  sees PRIMROSE , goes to her ) Prim ! How marvelous ! Prim ! PRIMROSE DRURY ( Embraces and kisses him ) Derek ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You look marvelous ! You look like a million dollars ! DEREK PENGO ( Laughs ) How could I get in here if I did n't ! ( He looks around the room ) . Five years ! And everything exactly the same ! Miss Swanson at Father 's desk . How 's Daphne ? PRIMROSE DRURY She 's kinda she 'll be awful glad to see you , Derek . p. 122 DEREK PENGO I 'll be happy to see her . PRIMROSE DRURY Maybe we can arrange something for tonight . DEREK PENGO That would be fine . PRIMROSE DRURY Well , I know you 'll be wanting to talk to Miss Swanson . I 'll just go up and have a look around ( As she goes to the door ) Oh , Miss Swanson . Next week is our anniversary  --  Jerome 's and mine . I 'd like to pick up something for him . MISS SWANSON Shall I ring for Johnson ? PRIMROSE DRURY Do you think I need Johnson ? I know this place better than Johnson . I 'll look around till Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let me know the minute Joe comes , will you ? ( MISS SWANSON nods ) So good to have you back , Derek . Daphne 'll be delighted ! DEREK PENGO Give her my love . PRIMROSE DRURY I sure will ! ( With a little chuckle ) She 's just about ready for it ! ( PRIMROSE goes out . MISS SWANSON and DEREK are alone . MISS SWANSON lifts her head from the memoranda . DEREK walks around the room . He unveils the Rembrandt ) p. 123 DEREK PENGO What a marvelous Rembrandt ! Dad certainly gets them , does n't he ? MISS SWANSON Yes . He gets them . DEREK PENGO How is he , Miss Swanson ? MISS SWANSON That 's why I sent for you , Derek . DEREK PENGO You said it was because he wanted to see me but was too proud to ask me to come . MISS SWANSON You know how terribly you felt  --  when your mother died so suddenly  --  and you were n't here . DEREK PENGO ( After a moment ) Is it like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last trip to Europe . I want you to sail with him . I want you to be with him . ( A moment ) Do n't say I had anything to do with it . DEREK PENGO Of course not . Bless you for sending for me . Does he know ? MISS SWANSON Of course he does . He 's known for the last four years . But never a word out of him . DEREK PENGO Has it slowed him up ? MISS SWANSON Not in the least . He 's going stronger than ever . Right this minute he 's pulling off the biggest project of his career . The Terwilliger Collection . He 's as excited as if it were his first deal . p. 124 DEREK PENGO You said once that with him selling was a disembodied activity  --  like praying . MISS SWANSON Yes . Like the saints , he will die praying ! DEREK PENGO ( At the model , his hand on it ) After he finished this  --  his Grand Design  --  he was going to begin to live . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great man , Miss Swanson . MISS SWANSON Of course he is . They ought to put up a statue to him . DEREK PENGO Does he ever refer to our quarrel ? MISS SWANSON No . But it shook him . I know he has n't forgotten it . DEREK PENGO I was insufferable . MISS SWANSON You had your point . DEREK PENGO I suppose so . But actually you know MISS SWANSON Well ? DEREK PENGO It sounded like righteous indignation but the truth is it was jealousy jealousy of Oliver frustration over Daphne . ( MISS SWANSON , in neatening up the desk , has picked up the photograph of Lady Pengo ) DEREK PENGO ( Takes the photograph from her and looks at it ) Wherever he was  --  in hotel rooms and houses everywhere  --  the first thing Father always did was to unpack this picture of Mother . p. 125 MISS SWANSON Yours too . DEREK PENGO And now she 's gone . How she waited and waited for that " some day " that Father was always promising her . It never came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? For anybody ? I suppose mine will come when I retire to my mother 's cottage in Glens Falls . And do you know what I 'll be doing there ? Thinking back on all that went on here in this room  --  all the dealing and sharpshooting  --  and how wonderful and exciting it was , during all those thirty-five years , just to be near your father . ( MISS SWANSON derives comfort somehow from the fact that DEREK now shares her secret . The intercom buzzes ) Yes ? ( She hangs up ; to DEREK ) It 's your father . He 's on the way up . ( She starts for her office ) Remember  --  you have n't a notion And , Derek , tell him how well he 's looking ! DEREK PENGO ( Very moved ) Trust me . ( MISS SWANSON exits . DEREK hears steps approaching and goes quickly to the Rembrandt , pretending to lose himself in it . PENGO enters . He looks older . He is still vibrant and vital , but , somehow , his clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling , in some indefinable way , that he is mortally stricken ) p. 126 LORD PENGO ( Sees DEREK  --  unable to believe his eyes ) Derek ! Derek ! DEREK PENGO Father ! It 's good to see you ! LORD PENGO If I had n't become an Englishman  --  and a member of the House of Lords I should give way to my feelings . ( They stand looking at each other ) After all  --  I 'm Hungarian  --  why not ? ( He embraces DEREK , quickly , impulsively , awkwardly  --  grins ) DEREK PENGO You 're looking wonderful ! LORD PENGO ( Cheerfully ) It 's apoplexy ! But you , Derek , you ( He surveys him ) Painting in plein air agrees with you . You look wonderfully healthy . ( Surveying his costume critically ) Ca n't say I like your tie . DEREK PENGO I 'll borrow one of yours . LORD PENGO ( Severely ) Nor is it tied properly . In fact it is n't tied at all do you mind if I I am reconciled to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look like one ! ( He straightens DEREK 'S tie ) p. 127 DEREK PENGO I 'm afraid I do n't suit the premises . LORD PENGO Suit them ! You clash with them . But I see you noticed that Rembrandt . DEREK PENGO It would be hard not to notice it . LORD PENGO How do you like it ? DEREK PENGO ( As they stand before the Rembrandt ) It 's glorious ! LORD PENGO ( Teasing him a bit ) They were n't bad in their way , were they  --  the old fellows ? DEREK PENGO ( Takes his father 's tone ) No  --  in their way they were n't bad ! LORD PENGO Aristotle . I ca n't say I 've read him , but now that I own him I feel very close to him . Greatest Rembrandt I ever owned . Greatest Rembrandt anybody ever owned . DEREK PENGO ( Laughs ) You forget , Dad  --  I 'm not a customer ! But I 'm delighted to find you in such good spirits . LORD PENGO Why should n't I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's dying . ( Quickly , possible misunderstanding ) I do n't mean that 's why I 'm in good spirits . We 're great pals now , Drury and I. What do you think I found him doing ? He was sitting on that Renaissance throne I sold him  --  remember that throne , Derek ? p. 128 DEREK PENGO ( A humorous rapport between them ) I remember it very well . As good a throne as you 'd find anywhere . LORD PENGO ( With a hint of reprimand ) You would n't find a throne like that anywhere . You 'd just find it here . Well , there he was , poor Drury , sitting on that throne . The organ he 's had installed in the house I built for him was playing " Silver Threads Among the Gold . " He was chewing gum and reading The Saturday Evening Post . ( DEREK laughs ) He showed me with great pride a letter he 'd received from the President of the United States , thanking him for donating that ( Points to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one man in the world Drury hates it 's F.D.R. , and yet he 's as pleased as a little boy over that letter . There 's something about the Presidency that impresses people . ( He chuckles at his own conceit , and as he feels response from DEREK , he gets more and more wound up . He puts his hand on DEREK 'S shoulder ) It 's a funny thing , Derek  --  there are only two of my giants left  --  Drury and Sylvester Schmitt . You remember Sylvester Schmitt ? DEREK PENGO The Burton Holmes man ? LORD PENGO That 's right . He 's dying , too . I 'm the special emissary between the two deathbeds . I give them daily bulletins about each other . Schmitt will say : " How was Drury when you saw him yesterday ? " I say , " Terrible . " That gives Schmitt a nip-up . Drury will say : " How 's that vulgarian Schmitt ? " " Awful , " I say . That bucks Drury up . The funny thing is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny thing is  --  here are these two men  --  both dying  --  and all that remains to them is the art I sold them . You take Schmitt  --  I was with him the morning he had to say good-bye to his pictures , before sending them ( He points to model ) over there . It was like a father losing his children . I did my best to console him  --  I said that his children were going to a good home and would be well cared for . Still  --  when they were taken away  --  he wept . I 'm ashamed to say , I did too In the chill that surrounds them , in the fear they feel , their only comfort , their only warmth , is the glow that comes to them from my pictures . Their families have disappointed them , their money and their power no longer sustain them , they are generally hated , but the pictures are their loyal friends and companions  --  the pictures are their accomplishment and their pride . They forget that I supplied them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tactful to remind them . DEREK PENGO There 's no one like you , Father . There never was . LORD PENGO ( Reminiscently ) It has been amusing . I 've enjoyed it . DEREK PENGO And what makes me happy is that you 're still enjoying it . p. 130 LORD PENGO ( A pause . He looks at his son with deep tenderness ) I ca n't tell you , Derek , how pleased I am to see you . DEREK PENGO I ca n't tell you , Father , how happy I am to see you . LORD PENGO ( Briskly , to get away from emotion ) What are you doing in New York ? DEREK PENGO I hesitate to tell you . LORD PENGO Do n't hesitate . My clients do that . It makes me nervous . Do n't you do it ! DEREK PENGO Well , Father , the fact is the simple fact is LORD PENGO Well ? DEREK PENGO I missed you and wanted to see you . LORD PENGO ( Quietly ) I am very touched , my boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come to feel that in the issue between us  --  that terrible quarrel we had  --  that I was wrong . I 've worked at my painting . I have n't spared myself . But I 've come to realize I 'm not a great talent . I 'll never set the Thames on fire , I 'm just clever . Not good enough . I would like , if you will have me , to come back into the business . p. 131 LORD PENGO I wo n't take you ! DEREK PENGO You 're still angry then ? LORD PENGO My dear boy you quite misunderstand . I wo n't take you because  --  in the issue between us  --  in the quarrel we had  --  you were right . It was I who was wrong . You stick to what you 're doing . I am gross , you are sensitive . I am predatory , you are an idealist . I am a huckster , you have a dream of creation . In short , you are an artist . Having sold dead artists all my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am , my boy , to have a live artist in the family . No . No . You go back to France and paint . I 'll be in England for a bit and we can see each other . DEREK PENGO ( Playing it out ) Well , it 's a graceful rejection . LORD PENGO Rejection ? DEREK PENGO Well , is n't it ? Nicely put , of course . LORD PENGO I am not going to allow a momentary discouragement to push you off course . We 're different temperaments . Totally different . I 'm an exhibitionist . I 've put on a performance . I 've enjoyed it . But occasionally I ask myself : " What are you , beneath the performance ? " DEREK PENGO And what is your reply to that question ? p. 132 LORD PENGO I always refuse to answer  --  on advice of counsel . DEREK PENGO I will not allow you to underrate yourself . I see now what I did n't see when I was younger and knew it all  --  that you are  --  do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Except that , unlike most visionaries , you have the gift of reality . LORD PENGO ( With a darting smile at him ) Well , I am aware there is plenty of ground for criticism , but do you know , when I look back  --  when I think of my opportunities  --  I am dazzled by my moderation . But did n't somebody say that ahead of me ? DEREK PENGO They did , but you might have invented it . ( A moment ) Miss Swanson tells me you 're sailing tomorrow . LORD PENGO That 's right . DEREK PENGO Since you wo n't take me back in the business , I 've got nothing to do here . Could n't I sail with you ? LORD PENGO Would you ? Would you really ? DEREK PENGO I 'd love to . I 'm rather at loose ends , as a matter of fact . LORD PENGO ( Overjoyed ) Well , I 'll tighten them up . Are you free for dinner ? p. 133 DEREK PENGO Free as a bird . LORD PENGO Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fine . LORD PENGO Speaking of Daphne ( Suddenly struck by a marvelous idea ) My God , Derek , Daphne ! ( He takes his arm and starts walking him across the room , his voice dropping to a confidential whisper ) You know all about Daphne . The marriage to Oliver was a disaster . I 'm responsible for that , in a way . I feel considerable guilt over that . Now , Derek , I can make handsome amends to Daphne ! DEREK PENGO How ? LORD PENGO Daphne 's crazy about you . She 's never forgotten you . She realizes what a mistake she made . You and Daphne ! What you always wanted . Do n't sail with me . Stay and woo Daphne . No , I 've got a better idea . I 'll get Daphne to sail with us ( He lunges to the telephone to make a reservation ) DEREK PENGO Do n't do that , Father . LORD PENGO Why not ? DEREK PENGO Because it 's impossible  --  there 's something I have to tell you  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd better tell you now . p. 134 LORD PENGO What ? DEREK PENGO I 'm engaged to be married . LORD PENGO To whom ? DEREK PENGO My model . LORD PENGO Model ! DEREK PENGO Just before I sailed I asked her to marry me . LORD PENGO ( With mounting anger ) You mean to say you 're going to marry a French peasant girl when Daphne DEREK PENGO ( Quiet but firm ) Yes , Father , that is what I am going to do . LORD PENGO ( In a towering rage ) It 's insane ! It 's idiotic it 's DEREK PENGO Please , Father , do n't work yourself up ! LORD PENGO But it 's so stupid ! You 're throwing your life away ! DEREK PENGO I do n't think so . LORD PENGO Really , it 's too  --  Bohemian ! You 've just said you do n't believe in your talent . Do you think you 'll increase it by marrying a model ? Are you imitating the great artists who married their models ? I should think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 135 DEREK PENGO Please , Father , do n't let 's quarrel again . LORD PENGO ( The enormity of it grows on him ) Here 's Daphne  --  crazy about you  --  waiting for you  --  the girl you always wanted ! DEREK PENGO I no longer want her . Father , I want you to meet Yvette . LORD PENGO I have no wish to meet Yvette . ( Repeats contemptuously the commonplace name ) Yvette ! DEREK PENGO She 's a dear girl and I 'm happy with her , Father . LORD PENGO But you were in love with Daphne for so long You wanted no one in the world but Daphne ! DEREK PENGO I suffered over Daphne . Daphne can not make me suffer again . LORD PENGO Is that why you wo n't marry her  --  because she can no longer make you suffer ? DEREK PENGO Do you want me to marry Daphne just to absolve your sense of guilt over Oliver ? ( The question is searching . It stops PENGO ) LORD PENGO ( After a pause ) Perhaps you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sorry . I apologize . ( He snaps out of it ) What fun it will be  --  sailing with you . Now , Derek , tell you what  --  where are you staying ? p. 136 DEREK PENGO The Penfield . LORD PENGO Never heard of it . Ca n't be any good . You shall move to the St. Regis where I have more room than I can use . DEREK PENGO Delighted . LORD PENGO As it 's my last afternoon here I have a few things to clean up . Get out of your hotel and meet me at the St. Regis in an hour . DEREK PENGO Right . LORD PENGO Do you mind if I ask Daphne for dinner ? DEREK PENGO Not at all . I 'd love to see her . ( FILBERT comes in ) FILBERT Good to ' ave Mr. Derek back , your Lordship ! LORD PENGO Very good . You know , Filbert , he 's sailing with me . FILBERT Indeed ! Wonderful . LORD PENGO Now then , Filbert , about this Texan , Slocum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've invaded Texas ! DEREK PENGO Was Texas responsive ? LORD PENGO My dear boy , where art is concerned , Texas is a virgin  --  a colossal and immensely rich and eager virgin  --  waiting to be ravished . p. 137 DEREK PENGO Hope you wo n't hold her up too long ! LORD PENGO Oh , she 's got to learn that in the field of art there is , between passion and consummation , an anxious interval ! FILBERT Mr. Slocum ' as written askin ' for an immediate appointment . LORD PENGO ( As of yore , puts on a show for DEREK ) Well , he ca n't have it , as I am sailing . But you see him and sell him Mrs. Siddons . He 's ripe  --  I 've conditioned him . ( He looks at Mrs. Siddons ) She 's almost too good for Texas . Still , stretch a point . That 's about all , Filbert . See you at the boat . Ask Miss Swanson to come in . And Mrs. Auerbach . FILBERT Mrs. Auerbach is looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She turns up ' er nose at everything I show ' er . LORD PENGO Does she ? FILBERT Yes , my Lord . LORD PENGO For her husband , you say ? FILBERT Yes , my Lord . For their third wedding anniversary . It 's got to be something special , she says . LORD PENGO Special ( His face lights up  --  he 's got it ) Send her in here , Filbert . I 'll give her something special . p. 138 FILBERT Yes , your Lordship . ( FILBERT goes ) LORD PENGO Admirable fellow , Filbert . No brains . Have to leave everything to Miss Swanson , who has plenty . Yet I shall miss him tomorrow on the Berengaria . DEREK PENGO Well , Dad , you ca n't have everything ! LORD PENGO ( Mock defiance ) Who says you ca n't ! ( PRIMROSE comes back ) PRIMROSE DRURY There 's nothing any good in your shop any more , Joe . DEREK PENGO I 'll see you at dinner , Prim . PRIMROSE DRURY Lovely . I spoke to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be nicer . PRIMROSE DRURY ( With a fond look ) Daphne 'll be so pleased ! ( DEREK goes . She looks after DEREK fondly ) Gosh , that 's a nice boy . What a stupid girl Daphne is  --  she could have saved herself all that trouble . LORD PENGO Daphne may be stupid but Derek is n't very bright either , I regret to say . PRIMROSE DRURY Why ? p. 139 LORD PENGO He 's going to marry an anonymous French girl . PRIMROSE DRURY ( This is a blow to her ) Really ? LORD PENGO ( Depressed by it too ) I 'm afraid so . PRIMROSE DRURY Damn ! LORD PENGO Same here ! Double damn . ( Broods for a moment ) As I say  --  I love Derek , but he 's not very bright . PRIMROSE DRURY ( A pause ) Well , there 's nothing to do , is there ? LORD PENGO Nothing at all . PRIMROSE DRURY ( Snaps out of it ) Say , Joe , I 'm desperate for something to give Jerome for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing  --  a marvelous thing  --  that will make him happy forever . PRIMROSE DRURY I 'd love to give him something that will make him happy forever  --  in case I ca n't ! LORD PENGO Come here , Prim . ( With solemnity , as becomes the presence of a masterpiece , PENGO walks impressively upstage . PRIMROSE follows him , dutifully . PENGO pauses in front of the Masaccio . Points to it dramatically ) This picture  --  which Bernard Berenson has called one of the masterpieces of Renaissance painting  --  The Circumcision , by Masaccio. p. 140 PRIMROSE DRURY ( Peers at it ) Ai n't it kinda dark ? Ai n't it kinda gloomy ? LORD PENGO To you , perhaps . It wo n't be to your husband . Remember he is a doctor . It will have a professional interest for him  --  as well as racial . PRIMROSE DRURY ( Impressed ) Gee , sounds just right for him , do n't it ? LORD PENGO I believe that Masaccio painted it  --  four centuries ago  --  with Jerome in mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . LORD PENGO Oh , more than that , Prim ! Your husband is an eminent man . The possession of this picture will make him unique . PRIMROSE DRURY Okay , Joe . Wrap it up . ( MISS SWANSON returns ) MISS SWANSON Derek 's fixed up for tomorrow . " A " deck . Not far from you . LORD PENGO Good ! ( He walks PRIMROSE to the door ) See you soon , Prim . PRIMROSE DRURY What time ? LORD PENGO Eight-thirty ! PRIMROSE DRURY Fine . ( Pauses at the door ) Shall I tell the bad news to Daphne ? p. 141 LORD PENGO No , no . Why mention it ? Maybe she can break it up . She 's done it before . PRIMROSE DRURY You cheer me up , Joe . You really do . ( PRIMROSE goes . The moment she has gone , PENGO gives way to ecstasy . He is so jubilant that he runs to MISS SWANSON who is bending over the desk putting memoranda into PENGO 'S dispatch case , and slaps her on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands ) MISS SWANSON Lord Pengo ! LORD PENGO What do you think , Miss Swanson ? What do you think ? MISS SWANSON Well , I must say , Lord Pengo , I do n't know what to think ! LORD PENGO ( Crows in triumph ) I 've sold it . I 've sold that damn Masaccio ! MISS SWANSON Is that all ? LORD PENGO Is that all ! You say is that all . Do you know how long that bloody picture has been hanging on my walls , here and in London ? For thirty-five years . No one would buy it . No one . I could n't give it away . And now I just sold it to Prim . Can you imagine a better present for a psychiatrist ? Why , it 's like selling it to Sigmund Freud himself . ( During this hymn MISS SWANSON , back at her desk , never lifts her head from her papers ) Well , Miss Swanson , it 's been a good day ! p. 142 MISS SWANSON I 'm glad you call it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? Derek 's return and I got rid of the Masaccio . ( Suddenly suspicious ) By the way  --  Derek  --  you had nothing to do with that , had you ? MISS SWANSON Nothing whatever . Derek never let me know he was coming . I was as surprised as you were . LORD PENGO ( Very brisk and business-like ) One last thing , Miss Swanson , about the Terwilliger Collection . I 'm negotiating about it with Drury . He says I ask too much . MISS SWANSON And so you do . LORD PENGO I always have . Why should I change now ? My idea is this : to repeat my technique with the Lane Collection . The sculpture and tapestries in the collection Drury is n't interested in  --  just the paintings . If he will pay fifteen million for them , I will offer that for the collection . Then I will give Drury the paintings , so that I shall get the sculpture and the tapestries for nothing . MISS SWANSON I guess they 're worth that ! LORD PENGO In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Swanson . MISS SWANSON In other circumstances I should welcome it ! ( He gives her a sharp look ) p. 143 LORD PENGO Well , Miss Swanson , I think you might be a bit more gracious , considering I am leaving tomorrow and wo n't be back for a considerable time . MISS SWANSON Sorry . I 'll try . LORD PENGO You know , Miss Swanson , no matter what you may think , I never felt better in my life . I know that Dr. Gumbach takes a poor view of me and that you have talked to Dr. Gumbach . But let me remind you that I 've outlived four doctors . I confidently expect to outlive Dr. Gumbach . MISS SWANSON ( Bent over her papers ) I am sure you will . LORD PENGO ( After a moment ) Well , Miss Swanson , I guess that 's all . ( A pause . PENGO looks around the room . He knows that he will never see it again . He walks to the Rembrandt , stares at it ) I hate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one pronouncing an odd doom mournfully ) He 'll end up in Texas ! MISS SWANSON You can go to Texas to see him . LORD PENGO ( Musing aloud in front of the Rembrandt ) I did n't feel well in Texas . Do n't think I 'll ever make that trip again . I do confess , Miss Swanson , I feel a bit tired . I think , after I 've settled some immediate business in London , I 'll go to the country and rest for a while . I have this lovely place in Kent and yet I 've never spent more than a weekend there . p. 144 MISS SWANSON That 's an excellent idea  --  but you wo n't do it ! ( MISS SWANSON pours water from a carafe into a glass and takes a pill from a little silver box ) Take your pill . LORD PENGO I think today I 'd better have two . ( MISS SWANSON hesitates , then takes out another pill and gives it to him ) Well , Miss Swanson , I guess that 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MISS SWANSON 'S iron control deserts her without warning . She starts sobbing into her handkerchief . PENGO is startled and concerned ) Why , Miss Swanson , what 's the matter ? ( MISS SWANSON shakes her head without lifting it ) I will see you at the boat , wo n't I ? ( MISS SWANSON nods without lifting her head . PENGO comes close to her ; in an altered voice ) Well , there 's no use pretending with you , is there ? There never has been . Anyway , we 've had an interesting time , have n't we ? Outside of you , I 've fooled everybody for four years . That 's pretty good . Is n't it ? ( A moment . MISS SWANSON 'S face is still invisible . PENGO does n't know what to do , quite ) I am flattered , Miss Swanson . It proves that I could not have been such a bad boss after all . Really  --  by the way , Miss Swanson  --  my God , I ca n't believe it ! I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now to call you by your first name and it suddenly struck me  --  I do n't know your first name . Is n't it awful ? Please , Miss Swanson , tell me your first name . p. 145 MISS SWANSON ( Muffled , from her handkerchief ) Edna . LORD PENGO Thank you . Dear Edna . Dearest Edna , thank you for everything . ( A moment . It is important for PENGO to keep MISS SWANSON from getting too emotional and he knows how to do it ) And one more thing , there 's something else I 've forgotten . Miss Swanson  --  Edna  --  get Severance on the phone and tell him to meet me at the boat tomorrow . It 's important ! MISS SWANSON ( Lifts her head and rasps at him ) What do you want with that old fuss-budget ? Have n't you gassed with him enough ? LORD PENGO ( With dignity ) You forget he is my lawyer . MISS SWANSON What are you selling him ? LORD PENGO You misunderstand me . You underrate me . In my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now that I know that you feel for me so deeply , I certainly intend to increase your percentage ! ( That does it ! Furious , MISS SWANSON makes an angry gesture and runs out of the room . Left alone , PENGO picks up the glass and swallows the second pill . He gets up , and looks around the room . He walks to the Rembrandt ; he makes a tour of the room , pauses before Mrs. Siddons . He goes to the model , touches it , goes to the desk , puts his wife 's photograph into the open dispatch case , snaps it shut . Carrying it , he starts to go . As he turns , the Masaccio catches his eye . In affectionate farewell , he waves to the Masaccio and goes out through the sky-lighted gallery )                                            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
