 | Few of the millions who watch the top-rated Laugh-In television show each week realize that my husband , Dan Rowan , has diabetes . Even if they did know , they probably would n't understand what being a diabetic entails . I certainly did n't until Dan 's diabetic condition was discovered about four years ago . Yet the American Diabetes Association estimates that more than four million people in the United States have diabetes ? and many of them do n't know it . Sometimes I feel sorry for my husband . I have watched him as he sat on the edge of the bed in the morning with a syringe , some alcohol , cotton and two bottles of insulin . He has to inject the insulin into his arm or some other part of his body , and occasionally he 'll hit a muscle , which results in a painful bruise . But Dan never complains . I was n't prepared for the news about his diabetes . I was born in Holland in 1942 , and my parents moved to Perth , Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he and his partner , Dick Martin , toured " Down Under " in 1963 . As a teen-ager , I had dated a boy in Perth whose mother had diabetes . She was frail and sickly , practically an invalid , but then her condition existed before the availability of modern medical controls . So when the doctor told me my husband was a diabetic , I pictured that boy 's sick mother . It was an inaccurate picture . If you 'll pardon the pun , Dan Rowan is not a " sick " comedian . He 's as energetic as the next man . He loves to swim , play tennis , or sail near our home in Marina del Ray , California . While taping the Laugh-In show ( at NBC 's studios in Beautiful Downtown Burbank ) , Dan sometimes works fourteen to sixteen hours with only brief rests . On tour , he and Dick follow a schedule that would exhaust most men . Yet , like other diabetics , Dan must diet , exercise and constantly be aware of how he feels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still remains somewhat of a medical puzzle . The most common form of the disease , diabetes mellitus ? sometimes called " sugar diabetes " results from the body 's inability to utilize sugars . Normally , the pancreas gland produces a hormone called insulin , which promotes the proper conversion of carbohydrates into energy . But the pancreas of a diabetic produces too little insulin , or makes insulin that is unable to perform all its work . Sugar that can not be used or stored , because of this faulty mechanism , accumulates as glucose in the blood , until the surplus passes through the kidneys into the urine . At the same time , the body attempts to break down body fat for its energy needs . If too much fat is used , the body will pile up an excess of fatty acids . This poi-sons  | the body and leads to a state of acidosis , coma , and then death . The more severe diabetic combats this condition by taking injections of insulin . However , this poses a problem too . If he waits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through physical activity , or inadvertently takes too much insulin , this may cause an " insulin reaction . " His system gets out of balance : instead of having too little insulin , it now has too much . The diabetic in this condition may experience light-headedness , faintness , trembling , hunger , slurred speech , sweating , or even become unconscious . So the diabetic walks a tightrope . Yet , with care and determination , there is no reason why he ca n't lead a presumably normal life . After Drs . Frederick G. Banting and Charles H. Best discovered insulin in 1922 , physicians were able to control diabetes , but they knew little about its causes , or why only certain people develop the condition . Heredity seems to be involved . Fat people seem more prone to diabetes than skinny people . More women get it than men , and diabetes occurs more commonly after age 40 . Yet , as far as Dan Rowan knows , none of his ancestors ever had diabetes , and he has never been more than a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition was diagnosed , the disease can strike children , too . A nine-day-old child once developed diabetes ? and so did a ninety-nine-year-old woman . Diabetes can occur without warning and at any age . Dan did n't have diabetes when we met in 1963 . At the time , I was working as a model in Sydney . When Dan and Dick came to Australia for a monthlong engagement , I attended their opening night with an actor who had emceed the team 's Australian tour the previous year . We all went out together after the show . Dan and I liked each other immediately . The situation might have ended right there if we had n't accidentally met the next day . My beauty parlor was in the hotel where Dan and Dick were staying . I was rushing in late for a hairdo appointment and Dan was rushing out for an interview when we practically collided . Dan said : " Let 's have dinner tonight . " That 's how it started . After that we saw a lot of each other : deep-sea fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Fiji Islands on a modeling assignment . I did n't want to go , but I expected . Dan to return to the United States soon and thought I probably would never hear from him again . The assignment , however , might help further my career . I spent ten days in the Fiji Islands , and Dan called me each night . On the morning I returned to Sydney , he got up at 7:30 , after working all night , to meet me at the airport . Only now , after six years of marriage , do I realize what a loving sacrifice he had made that day . We had breakfast together and he proposed . At first I thought we ought to think it over . He outlined the problems I 'd face as the wife of a man who already had children , from a previous marriage . Eventually I accepted , but he wanted to tell his children before the ceremony took place . Dan has three children : Tom graduated from California 's Santa Clara University in June and he stays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the youngest at seventeen , lives with her mother . Dan and Dick returned to California at the end of their engagement , and I followed three weeks later . We considered a big church wedding but gave up the idea ? Dan is an orphan and has no family and mine was in Australia . We just set the date and that morning we called a judge in Beverly Hills and he married us ? in an office at Paramount Studios . Dick ran around , bubbling , taking pictures like crazy . None of them came out . Ours is a busy household . We have three toy poodles , and I play tennis , cook , sew and study classical guitar . But my main interest is Dan . Whenever he travels with his act , unless it 's just a one-night stand , I travel with him . Dan is careful about his health . He  | has always made it a practice to have a complete physical once a year . As far back as 1965 , his doctor had advised him to stop working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ignore ? this was several years before the LaughIn became the demanding hit it is . In March of that year , after Dan and Dick had played four weeks in Las Vegas and then three weeks at Lake Tahoe , Dan seemed more tired than usual . He did n't want to do anything , not even play golf . That 's not like him . I attributed his listlessness to the long tour and the fact that Lake Tahoe is 6,000 feet above sea level ? very demanding on anyone 's energy . He would wake in the morning and say : " Gosh , Adriana , I feel just as tired now as when I went to bed . " When we returned to Los Angeles Dan checked into the hospital for a minor operation . He had had the usual series of tests the day before , and now the doctor told Dan there was something wrong with his pancreas . The doctor thought it could be diabetes or maybe a pancreatic tumor , which could have been extremely dangerous , for the pancreas is located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . The doctor made additional tests and concluded it was only diabetes . Both Dan and . I relaxed . " It was almost as though I had copped out to a lesser plea , " Dan claimed . Dan probably had diabetes at the time of his previous examination . He had begun showing signs of excessive fatigue even then . His doctor , for some reason , had neglected to give Dan either blood or urine tests . This could have proved fatal . If Dan 's diabetes had gone undetected much longer , he might have simply lapsed one day into a diabetic coma . The prospect of spending the rest of his life as a diabetic did n't disturb Dan too much , after he learned what was involved . Diabetes is no longer quite the bothersome disease it was several decades ago . There are pills available now that some diabetics take orally . One type stimulates the pancreas to produce more insulin . That 's what Dan was to take . His doctor was optimistic . " It 's probably the best thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 'll have to take care of yourself , get a lot of rest , exercise . You 'll be eating a proper diet and . your health will improve as a result . You 'll take a pill in the morning and you 'll forget it . " Well , it did n't work out quite that easily . One pill soon became two , then three . Then these became a different sort of pill , then six of one kind and three of another . After six months of a strictly regulated diet and increasing amounts of pills , the doctor finally conceded that the oral compounds would n't control Dan 's diabetes . So he showed Dan how to use a needle and syringe to inject himself with insulin . " There 's really nothing to it , " the doctor explained . " After a while it 'll become just like brushing your teeth in the morning . " Some time later Dan saw the doctor and said : " Say , exactly how do you brush your teeth in the morning ? " Dan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes I do it to keep in practice in case of an emergency . He uses two types of insulin at one time . The first type lowers the blood sugar rapidly , but only temporarily . It reaches its peak in three to four hours and disappears in six to eight . The other type reaches its peak in eight to twelve hours and lasts until the following morning . The amount of insulin Dan takes depends upon the type of day he plans to have . If he eats a light breakfast and engages in any physical activity he will need less . For instance , if he plans to play tennis and work all afternoon before having dinner at eight , his physical activity will burn off the excessive sugar in his blood system . However , plans do n't always work out . Rain may cancel the tennis game . A friend may invite him home for a light lunch that turns out to be a sumptuous meal , which Dan will be too polite to refuse . The large meal will increase his blood sugar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . The important thing for Dan is that he be aware of what is happening in his system . It 's strange , but at certain times of the year Dan can balance his system with only small amounts of insulin . When we 're on vacation he can stay up late and sometimes eat yummy cakes , yet his blood . sugar level remains normal . But during the period when he 's taping Laugh-In shows , when he may eat less and be twice as active , his sugar level may go way up . It 's probably due to the pressures of his work . While he enjoys doing the program , there 's still tension involved . Maybe all the excitement pumps more adrenaline into his system and keeps him off balance . It 's part of the puzzle of diabetes . People who have it should avoid tension . Dan ? who last year received the Diabetes Association of California 's " Man of the Year Award " ? believes there is no reason why a diabetic should consider himself an invalid . After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a long time , he and . Dick faced their greatest demands with Laugh-In ? and this was after Dan discovered his diabetes . If he had retired because he felt he was an " invalid , " he would have missed all that . And it 's hardly as an " invalid " that Dan , along with Dick , will star in MGM 's upcoming film , The Maltese Bippy . Many prominent , active people have refused to allow their diabetes to interfere with their busy lives . Among these are tennis players Billy Talbert and Ham Richardson ; former baseball star Jackie Robinson ; U.S. Senators Clinton Anderson and Gale McGee and comedian Joe E. Lewis . Among the many women who have diabetes , at least one , actress Mary Tyler Moore , is happy to declare publicly : " I 've never felt healthier in my lj ; " Her successful career in movies , television and on the stage speaks for itself . On the other hand , Dan claims that , for many people . having diabetes is like wearing a toupee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same condition . My husband makes no attempt to hide the truth . He realizes the appeal Laugh-In has for young people , and he feels he can help others by demonstrating that a person can have diabetes and live a perfectly normal life . Besides , he 's no hypocrite . For instance , Dan gets mail criticizing him for smoking on the show , particularly because smoking attacks the cardiovascular system and is certainly not indicated for diabetics . " I smoke on camera because I smoke off , " Dan says . " I think it would be terribly phony for me to be puffing away and then the minute I step in front of the camera ti squash out my cigarette . " The secrecy with which many diabetics treat themselves can be dangerous . Some years ago , a football player concealed his diabetes from everyone except his doctor and immediate family . One night , after an out-of-town game . had visited friends . Dinner was delayed and he became drowsy ? one of the warning signals of insulin reaction . He laid down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely very tired from the game , let him rest . He died ahe lay there . Dan , along with other diabetics , has to watch for the warning signals and take immediate steps to correct the imbalance . The need sometimes arises while Dan is on stage . Last New Year 's , when several members of the Laugh-In cast were appearing in Las Vegas , Dick Martin came off the stage and said he 'd noticed something was wrong with Dan . I saw the familiar symptoms ? Dan had the shakes . He could have paused to get help , but he 's a bit stubborn and steeped in the tradition that says the show must go on . Luckily , the script called for Ruth Buzzi to enter carrying a bottle of beer . I handed her a soft drink instead . She gave it to Dan as part of the scene and he drank it down . The sugar in the drink brought him back to normal before anybody in the audience realized what was happening . Because he knows that diabetes can be inherited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives them the same advice he follows : see your doc-  | tor , watch your diet and keep your weight down . Since Dan did n't develop diabetes until late in life , however , the odds are that his children have not inherited it . Nobody really knows yet what causes diabetes . In Dan 's case , it might stem from an experience he had in World War II when he served as a fighter pilot in the South Pacific . He was shot down over New Guinea and crash landed in a dry riverbed . The natives took him to the beach where an American ship picked him up , and Dan spent the next year in a hospital recovering from his injuries . It 's possible that those injuries eventually caused his pancreas to misfunction . No one knows for sure . In addition to watching his blood and urine sugar level , the diabetic should have a complete eye examination once a year : diabetes can cause blindness . Gangrene is another danger , since diabetes affects the circulatory system . Dan tries to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional medical attention , since any infection can cause trouble ? diabetes impedes the healing process . A pack of matches exploded in Dan 's hand a short time ago and , while the average person might have run cold water over it and forgotten about it , Dan went to a doctor . Unfortunately , Dan has an insatiable sweet tooth . If I order dessert for myself in a restaurant , he 'll end up eating most of it . More often , he hands me the menu , sighs , and says : " You choose . I do n't dare . " I rarely serve desserts at home . Even when we entertain friends , I resist the impulse to bake a calorie-laden cake . Instead , I offer a selection of fruits and cheeses , which most people , being dietconscious themselves , appreciate . I know that some women consider themselves martyrs because they have husbands who are diabetics . They even cook separate meals for them . I think that 's silly , although diet certainly is important . When I first started cooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I would n't let him eat even an apple or an orange without weighing it first to determine its caloric and carbohydrate content . But I was being overcautious . Ordinarily , planning meals for most diabetics does n't require such intense activity and thought . That 's destructive in itself , because pretty soon your entire life becomes wrapped around a diabetic condition that really is n't that serious . Most of the time Dan will maintain good health on 3,000 calories a day , but when he wants to lose a little weight I put him on a 1,500 calorie diet . Because it 's sometimes difficult for him to get a proper meal when he 's at the studio , I pack him a lunch , which he eats in his dressing room . He can eat three meals a day plus a late snack and still stay within the 1,500 calorie limit . At home I cook a lot of pot roasts , stews , chicken , veal and fish . When I buy beef I cut off'all the fat before I grind it up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in my own cooking I try to avoid the highcholesterol foods , including butter . A diabetic will be a diabetic all of his life . The condition can not be reversed once it begins , and there is no cure . My diabetic husband has company . The American Diabetes Association estimates that there are 2,600,000 known diabetics in the United States . Another 1,600,000 have diabetes and do n't realize it . Still another 5,600,000 people are potential diabetics . That means that one out of every twenty people you meet is either an actual or potential diabetic . Scientists are continuing to study this puzzling disease . Perhaps some day they will find a cure . In the meantime , all diabetics , including Dan , can lead normal lives if they follow their doctors ' advice in regard to diet , exercise and whatever program of medication he prescribes for them .
