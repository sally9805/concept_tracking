txt The apparent fiasco of the Wilson government in its attempt to , deal with wildcat strikes is not the end . of-the story . In fact , while one feels that Prime Minister Harold Wilson suffered a severe defeat in having to withdraw the government 's plan to deal with such strikes , the issue itself is in the open now in a way it has not been before . That issue is not solely how to deal with wildcat strikes . It involves a broadened concept of industrial relations in which both labor leaders and management become committed to a wider statesmanship . In talking , with business groups here , this reporter finds they by no means agreed on the wisdom of Mr. Wilson 's plan . Under it , the government would have had the power to enforce a cooling-off period . If workers  --  had refused to go back to work during this period , they would haVe been liable to fines for contempt of court . Damage already done But when things come to that stage , it is pointed out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain 's experience with wildcat strikes , it is asserted , is exaggerated anyhow . First , Britain is a small country with a national press . Each development receives maximum coverage in the London press and is immediately picked up by the international press . Secondly , because of Britain 's exposed position vis-a-vis its overall balance of payments , any strike that tends to affect this position  --  such as a dock strike or a strike in a major export industry ? is world news . Many Britons did not take kindly to the Bank for International Settlements phrase " tinge of anarchy " in British industrial relations . The BIS statement seems to this reporter at least partially justified . While total man-hours lost in British strikes is lower than some other . industrial nations , the particular areas subject to wildcat strikes can have a paralyzing effect on large segments of industry , particularly on the export trade . The long dock strike in 1967 was certainly a contributing factor to the British devaluation in that November . The apologists for'the situation are correct in pointing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrial statesmen // lain in two industries , transport and engineering . The fact that these are the main sensitive areas suggests that , the strikes , in general , have not been without some real grievances peculiar to these industries . Dock conditions , for instance , are notoriously bad in many countries . Currently , they are going through a process of mechanization , but , as one Briton said , " We are paying for the sins of the fathers . " Troubles in the motor car industry illustrate the other major area of grievances : engineering . Problems here are similar to those which Americans experienced earlier in Detroit , touching on such common areas as the speed and boredom of the assembly line . The emphasis of Mr. Wilson and Barbara Castle , as well as of Conservative leaders , seems to have been on putting the ultimate sanction of the law behind efforts to deal with wildcat strikes . Different view Some groups , however , such as the influential Confederation of British Industry , see the matter differently . The CBI has publicly exchanged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Labour plan . But the CBI 's aims in this area are actually quite similar to the government 's : to move toward greater harmony in industrial relations . The CBI would also move toward putting the ultimate sanction of the law behind labor agreements . But to emphasize this at the present juncture is putting the cart before the horse , reasoned a CBI spokesman . It ignores the present state of industrial relations . The CBI also feels that too many labor agreements in Britain are loosely written and not easily enforcible in court . Pressure suggested So , as a first step , the CBI would move to have the government instruct both management and labor in the few troublesome industries to work out enforceable agreements to be used in dealing with unofficial strikes . If this could not be done within a given period of time , the government itself might dictate what the terms of such an agreement should contain . Second , the CBI would use some government agency , such as a registrar of traae unions , to pressure the unions to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This could hasten the process of . plantwide bargaining and the grouping together of unions . ( Last winter a German official told this reporter that Britain 's main indUstrial trouble was that it had 250 unions , while Germany , whose unions were destroyed by Hitler and rebuilt with the advice of British and American labor leaders , has 16 . ) However one interprets the Wilson back-down on.the government 's demands , these facts remain : ? The prestige of the Wilson government is now linked to a substantial lessening of wildcat strikes . ? The Trades Union Congress has involved its own reputation in working for the same end . ? Foreigners have a right to expect , now that the issue is so much in the public domain , that it can not be laid to rest without being first resolved . And the sense of fairness that normally runs so deep in the relations of Britons with each other should aid in the evolution of this necessary next step in their industrial relations .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
