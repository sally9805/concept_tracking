As Americans watched the wedding of Britain 's Princess Margaret on NBC-TV last week ( see FOREIGN NEWS ) , they heard a flow of murmured Mayfairisms that were almost as impressive as the Archbishop of Canterbury 's solemnity . It was the sable-tongued voice of Richard Dimbleby , a tall , benign , Pickwickian commentator so unfailingly proper that he all but calls the thing in his hand a Michael . Dropping sterling syllables into the air from his glass-paneled aerie 60 ft. above Westminster Abbey 's nave , Dimbleby lived up not only to his reputation as England 's best commentator , but to his nicknames- " Bishop Dimbleby , " " Dick Dimbleboom , " and " The Royal Plum Pudding . " <P> In two impressive , hour-long BBC tapes flown from London to Canada and picked up in full from there by NBC ( other networks ran only newscasts and , later , highlights ) , Commentator Dimbleby described the princess tensely awaiting the walk to the altar , reassuringly reminded his audience of " the comforting , tall , friendly and alert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm she can rely . " He sifted the guests ( " What a tower of strength Lady Churchill is " ) , spoke as the Voice of England when the bride 's coach left the Abbey : " All of us wish , as she goes back through London , that her ways are ways of gentleness and all her paths are peaceful . " <P> Teleprayer . Full of subdued color , Dimbleby had a kindly plug or two for Queen Elizabeth 's coachman , Joseph Cooze . He described the mounted Sovereign 's Escort as " this lovely , twinkling jingle of breastplates , " and back at Buckingham Palace , when a telescopic longshot followed the royal family as they left the balcony and got a candid peek at the Queen Mother mimicking a part of the ceremony , Dimbleby was propriety itself : " I think we ought not to stand and watch the royal family inside their own house any more . " <P> When the hour arrived for the honeymoon couple 's departure on the yacht Britannia , Dimbleby met the severest test of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dick Dimbleboom to fill the BBC air with 55 minutes of spontaneous prose . It was a pukka job , a splendid sort of flight of the Dimbleby . He talked fluently of the Thames , sturdily of Tower Bridge , thickly of the city 's occasional fog . Five helicopters coptered overhead . Mounting to lance , Dimbleby told his audience : " If I had a really good air gun , I 'd know what to do with those five . " When the couple arrived at last , Dimbleby sent the princess " down Father Thames and down to the sea " with the teleprayer that " the sun shine on her in all the years that lie beyond . " <P> Teleknight ? If he keeps it up , Richard Dimbleby may well become what many British show people hope he will be : the first knight of television . He has lent his faultless , icky-wicket comments to nearly every royal occasion since World War II , including the funeral of King George VI , the wedding and the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first war correspondent , even broadcast from a Royal Air Force bomber on a raid over Berlin . In 1945 , he was arrested in Berlin by suspicious Russian soldiers , won his freedom by taking advantage of certain physical resemblances , gloweringly insisting that he was " a Churchill .
