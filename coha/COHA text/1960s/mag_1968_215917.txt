The case of Mike Kasperak differed from that of other transplant patients in the underlying cause of his heart disease . Kasperak , 54 , was stricken with a severe viral inflammation of the heart ( viral myocarditis ) ten years ago . Recently the inflammation had not been active , but the heart had become enlarged , more scarred and fibrous . Kasperak ( pronounced Ka-spair-ak ) quit his job as a Cleveland steelworker and retired to East Palo Alto , Calif . After a November episode of heart failure , he was admitted to Stanford Medical Center on Jan. 5 , in desperate plight . When Kasperak asked his wife , Feme , what she thought about a transplant , she gave what has fast become the standard answer of the Barnard era : " Go ahead-I want you alive with me . " <P> In this case also , the eventual donor had no thought of her own death when she talked to her husband about heart transplants . Virginia Mae White , 43 , had never had a serious illness as she celebrated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill " ) White . Next evening , she had a massive brain hemorrhage and was taken to El Camino Hospital in Mountain View , only eight miles from Stanford . When her doctors said there was no hope , White asked whether there was any type of research going on relating to what had happened to his wife- " something where she could help . " <P> Her neurosurgeon phoned Palo Alto , and White soon got a call from Dr. Norman E. Shumway Jr. , pioneering head of Stanford 's cardiovascular unit , a fellow resident with Cape Town 's Dr. Barnard at the University of Minnesota and the developer of the heart-transplant technique first used by Barnard . Shumway asked about a possible transplant . White talked it over with his children , Judith , 18 , and Richard , 12 . He also consulted Virginia 's mother . They all said yes . <P> Distributor Cap . When Mrs. White died , a team headed by Dr. William Angell removed her heart . Dr. Shumway did not have it perfused with blood , as had been done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implant . He simply had it kept in a cold saline solution , at about 50F . Kasperak , on a heart-lung machine , was cooled hardly at all . Applying experience gained from years of experimental surgery on animals , Dr. Shumway left in place two quadrantal areas of Kasperak 's heart , with venae cavae and pulmonary veins attached-analogous to the distributor cap of a six-cylinder car with its spark plug leads . Then he cut this section away from Mrs. White 's heart and tailored the remainder to fit . <P> There were many complications . Kasperak had worked in a fume-filled steel mill , had been a heavy smoker and , as a result , his lungs were leathery . They could not exchange enough oxygen to keep him going . So an incision was made in his throat and a tube inserted to supply oxygen more efficiently and to remove mucus . Kasperak 's big chest was rigid ; other organs showed little tendency to close in around the small heart , and the cavity filled with fluid . His liver and kidneys had been damaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
