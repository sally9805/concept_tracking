Like a Bad Dream A story by Heinrich B611 Translated by Leila Vennewitz That evening we had invited the Zumpens over for dinner , nice people , and it was through my father-in-law that we had got to know them ; ever since we have been married he has helped me to meet people who can be useful to me in business , and Zumpen can be useful  --  he is chairman of a committee which places contracts for large housing projects , and I have married into the excavating business . I was tense that evening , but Bertha , my wife , reassured me . " The fact , " she said , " that he 's coming at all is promising . Just try and get the conversation round to the contract . You know it 's tomorrow they 're going to be awarded . " I stood downstairs looking through the net curtains of the glass front door , waiting for Zumpen . I smoked , ground the cigarette butts under my foot , and shoved them under the mat . Next I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering why Zumpen had accepted the invitation : he could n't be that interested in having dinner with us , and the fact that the big contract I was involved in was going to be awarded tomorrow must have made the whole thing as embarrassing to him as it was to me . I thought about the contract too : it was a big one , I would make twenty thousand marks on the deal , and I wanted the money . Bertha had decided what I was to wear -- a dark jacket , trousers a shade lighter , and a conservative tie . That 's the kind of thing she learned at home , and at boarding school from the nuns . Also what to offer guests  --  when to pass the cognac , and when the vermouth , how to arrange desserts ; it is comforting to have a wife who knows all about such things . But Bertha was tense too ; as she put her hands on my shoulders , they touched my neck , and I felt her thumbs damp and cold against it . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 'll get the contract . " " Christ , " I said , " it means twenty thousand marks to me , and you know how we need the money . " " One should never , " she said gently , " mention Christ 's name in connection with money ! " A dark car drew up in front of our house , a make 1 did n't recognize , but it looked Italian . " Take it easy , " Bertha whispered ; " wait till they 've rung , let them stand there for a couple of seconds , then walk slowly to the door and open it . I watched Mr. and Mrs. Zumpen come up the steps . He is slender and tall , with graying temples , the kind of man who fifty years ago would have been known as a " ladies ' man " ; Mrs. Zumpen is one of those thin dark women who always make me think of lemons . I could tell from Zumpen 's face that it was a frightful bore for him to have dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited one second , two seconds , walked slowly to the door and opened it . " Well , " I said , " how nice of you to come ! " Cognac glasses in hand , we went from room to room in our apartment , which the Zumpens wanted to see . Bertha stayed in the kitchen to squeeze some mayonnaise out of a tube onto the appetizers ; she does this very nicely  --  hearts , loops , little houses . The Zumpens complimented us on our apartment ; they exchanged smiles when they saw the big desk in my study ; at that moment it seemed a bit too big even to me . Zunmen admired a , small rococo cabinet , a wedding present from my grandmother , and a baroque madonna in our bedroom . By the time we got back to the dining room , Bertha had dinner on the table ; she had done this very nicely too it was all so attractive yet so natural , and dinner was pleasant and relaxed . We talked about movies and books , about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Mrs. Zumpen praised the coffee and the pastries . Then we showed the Zumpens our Heinrich B011 's fiction and essays  --  translated into eighteen languages  --  have made him one of postwar Germany 's most important writers . His latest novel . " The Clown , " was published in the U. S. earlier this year by McGraw-Hill. honeymoon pictures : photographs of the Breton coast , Spanish donkeys , and street scenes from Casablanca . After that we had some more cognac , and when I stood up to get the box with the photos of the time when we were engaged , Bertha gave me a sign , and I did n't get the box . For two minutes there was absolute silence , because we had nothing more to talk about , and we all thought about the contract ; I thought of the twenty thousand marks , and it struck me that I could deduct the bottle of cognac from my income tax . Zumpen looked at his watch and said , " Too bad , it 's ten o'clock ; we have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And Mrs. Zumpen said . " It was really delightful , and I hope you 'll come to us one evening . " " We would love to , " Bertha said , and we stood around for another half-minute , all thinking again about the contract , and I felt Zumpen was waiting for me to take him aside and bring up the subject . But I did n't . Zumpen kissed Bertha 's hand , and I went ahead , opened the door , and held the car door open for Mrs. Zumpen down below . " Why , " said Bertha gently when I came in , " did n't you mention the contract to him ? You know it 's going to be awarded tomorrow . " " Well , " I said , " I did n't know how to bring the conversation round to it . " " Now look , " she said in a quiet voice , " you could have used any excuse to ask him into your study ; that 's where you should have talked to him . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ought to have said , have an eighteenth century crucifix in there you might like to have a look at , ' and then . . " Isaid nothing , and she sighed and tied on her apron . I followed her into the kitchen ; we put the rest of the appetizers back in the refrigerator , and I crawled about on the floor looking for the top of the mayonnaise tube . I put away the remains of the cognac , counted the cigars  --  Zumpen had smoked only one ; I emptied the ashtrays , ate another pastry , and looked to see if there was any coffee left in the pot . When I went back to the kitchen , Bertha was standing there with the car key in her hand . " What 's up ? " I asked . " We have to go over there , of course , " she said . " Over where ? " " To the Zumpens ' , " she said ; " where do you think ? " " It 's nearly half-past ten . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care if it 's midnight , " Bertha said , " all I know is , there 's twenty thousand marks involved . Do n't imagine they 're squeamish . " She went into the bathroom to get ready , and I stood behind her watching her wipe her mouth and draw in new outlines , and for the first time I noticed how wide and primitive that mouth is . When she tightened the knot of my tie I could have kissed her , the way I always used to when she fixed my tie , but I did n't . Downtown the cafes and restaurants were brightly lit . People were sitting outside on the terraces , and the light from the street lamps was caught in the silver ice-cream . dishes and ice buckets . Bertha gave me an encouraging look ; but she stayed in the car when we stopped in front of the Zumpens ' house , and I pressed the bell at once and was surprised how quickly the door was opened . Mrs. Zumpen did not seem surprised to see me : she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with yellow flowers , and this made me think more than ever of lemons . " I beg your pardon , " I said , " I would like to speak to your husband . " " He 's gone out again , " she said ; " he 'll be back in half an hour . " In the hall I saw a lot of madonnas , Gothic and baroque , even rococo madonnas , if there is such a thing . " I see , " I said , " well then , if you do n't mind I 'll come back in half an hour . " Bertha had bought an evening paper ; she was reading it and smoking , and when I sat down beside her she said , " I think you could have talked about it to her too . " " But how do you know he was n't there ? " " Because I know he is at the Gaffel Club playing chess , as he does every Wednesday evening at this time . " " You might have told me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Bertha , folding the newspaper . " I am trying to help you , I want you to find out for yourself how to deal with such things . All we had to do was call up Father and he would have settled the whole thing for you with one phone call , but I want you to get the contract on your own . " " All right , " I said ; " then what 'll we do ? Wait here half an hour , or go up right away and have a talk with her ? " " We 'd better go up right away , " said Bertha . We got out of the ear and went up in the elevator together . " Life , " said Bertha , " consists of making compromises and concessions . Mrs. Zumpen was no more surprised now than she had been earlier , when I had come alone . She greeted us , and we followed her into her husband 's study . Mrs. Zumpen brought some cognac , poured it out , and before I could say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " Housing Project Fir Tree Haven , " I read , and looked up in alarm at Mrs. Zumpen , at Bertha , but they both smiled and Mrs. Zumpen said , " Open the folder , " and I opened it . Inside was another one , pink , and on this I read , " Housing Project Fir Tree Haven  --  Excavation Work . " I opened this too , saw my estimate lying there on top of the pile ; along the upper edge someone had written in red , " Lowest bid . " I could feel myself flushing with pleasure , my heart thumping , and I thought of the twenty thousand marks . " Christ , " I said softly , and closed the file , and this time Bertha forgot to rebuke me . Korea Bound , 1952 by William Childress Braced against the rise and fall of ocean , holding the rail , we listen to the shrill complaining of the waves against the hulk , and see the Golden Gate rise with our motion . Some hours previous , bearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like slaves in some gigantic pyramid , selected by our Pharaoh for burial against our wills . Now we watch Alcatraz sink into the water , and visualize the pale , amorphous masks of prisoners , whose lack of freedom guarantees their lives . " Prost , " said Mrs. Zumpen with a smile , " let 's drink to it then . " We drank , and I stood up and said , " It may seem rude of me , but perhaps you 'll understand that I would like to go home now . " " I understand perfectly , " said Mrs , Zumpen . " There 's just one small item to be taken care of . " She took the file , leafed through it , and said , " Your price per square meter is thirty pfennigs below that of the next-lowest bidder . I suggest you raise your price by fifteen pfennigs ; that way , you 'll still be the lowest and you 'll have made an extra four thousand five hundred marks . Come on , do it now ! " Bertha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , but I was in too much of a turmoil to write ; I gave the file to Bertha and watched her alter the price with a steady hand , rewrite the total , and hand the file back to Mrs. Zumpen . " And now , " said Mrs. Zumpen , " just one more little thing . Get out your checkbook and write a check for three thousand marks ; it must be a cash check and endorsed by you . " She had said this to me , but it was Bertha who pulled our checkbook out of her purse and made out the check . " It wo n't be covered , " I said in a low voice . " When the contract is awarded , there will be an advance , and then it will be covered , " said Mrs. Zumpen . Perhaps I failed to grasp what was happening at the time . As we went down in the elevator , Bertha said she was happy , but I said nothing . Bertha chose a different way home . We drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , people sitting on balconies drinking wine ; it was a clear , warm night . " I suppose the check was for Zumpen ? " was all I said , softly , and Bertha replied , just as softly , " Of course . " I looked at Bertha 's small brown hands on the steering wheel , so confident and quiet . Hands , I thought , that sign checks and squeeze mayonnaise tubes , and I looked higher , at her mouth , and still felt no desire to kiss it . That evening I did not help Bertha put the car away in the garage , nor did I help her with the dishes . I poured myself a large cognac , went up to my study , and sat down at my desk , which was much too big for me . I was wondering about something ; I got up , went into the bedroom and looked at the baroque madonna , but even there I could n't put my finger on the thing I was wondering about . The ringing of the phone interrupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised to hear Zumpen 's voice . " Your wife , " he said , " made a slight mistake . She raised the price by twenty-five pfennigs instead of fifteen . " I thought for a moment and then said , " That was n't a mistake , she did it with my consent . " He was silent for a second or two , then said with a laugh , " So you had already discussed the various possibilities ? " " Yes , " I said . " All right ; then make out another check of a thousand . " " Five hundred , " I said , and I thought : It 's like a bad dream  --  that 's what it 's like . " Eight hundred , " he said , and I said with a laugh , " Six hundred , " and I knew , although I had no experience to go on , that he would now say seven hundred and fifty , and when he did I said , " Yes , " and hung up . It was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car to give Zumpen the check ; he was alone and laughed as I reached in to hand him the folded check . When I walked slowly back into the house , there was no sign of Bertha ; she did n't appear when I went back into my study ; she did n't appear when I went downstairs again for a glass of milk from the refrigerator , and I knew what she was thinking ; she was thinking : He has to get over it , and I have to leave him alone ; this is something he has to understand . But I never did understand . It is beyond understanding .
