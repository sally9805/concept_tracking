( See Cover ) <P> Japan 's Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi is a descendant of the swaggering but practical men of Choshu . Less than a century ago his clansmen enthusiastically followed the Emperor 's orders by opening fire on all foreign ships passing through Shimonoseki Strait , the narrow western entrance to the lovely Inland Sea . Retaliation came from a combined British , French , Dutch and U.S. fleet , which blew the Choshu batteries skyhigh , put ashore a landing party to seize the forts , and collected an indemnity of $3,000,000. - Impressed , the Choshu leaders fraternized with the Western officers , begged technical advice and sought to buy big guns like those that had destroyed their forts . Observes a present-day Japanese intellectual : " The men of Choshu are completely without sentiment . They act on the basis of logic and profit . Kishi is a typical Choshu man . " <P> Prime Minister Kishi , 63 , flew into Washington this week convinced that the logic of the world situation and the profit of Japan require his signature on the revision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree . In Tokyo 27,000 demonstrators battled police , and thousands of fanatical left-wing students made plain their feelings about the treaty by using the great doorway of the Japanese Diet for their own kind of public protest-a mass urination . <P> The students vowed to prevent Kishi 's take-off for the U.S. , and 700 of them seized the airport building the night before his departure last week , wrecked the restaurant and fought the police with bamboo spears and pepper shakers before they were ejected . Mobs of students lined the approaches to the airfield , prepared to stone Kishi 's car or throw themselves under its wheels . But with radio guidance supplied by a hovering helicopter , Kishi 's motorcade avoided what he called the " distasteful , insignificant demonstration , " and he serenely took off for his meeting with President Eisenhower . <P> Kishi 's diehard opponents protest that the treaty revision commits Japan to support all U.S. moves in the Pacific and may therefore " attract the lightning " of a Communist H-bomb attack . There are U.S. reservations about the treaty as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what amounts to a veto over the movement of U.S. troops on the perimeter of the Asian mainland . <P> The Losers . The treaty is to run for ten years , and its ten articles pledge that 1 ) both nations will take " action to counter the common danger " if the forces of either are attacked in Japan , though not elsewhere , 2 ) " prior consultation " will be held between the two before U.S. forces in Japan receive nuclear arms , 3 ) Japan is released from further contributions ( now $30 million a year ) for the support of U.S. troops in the islands . In Kishi 's words , the treaty will create an atmosphere of " mutual trust . " It inaugurates a " new era " of friendship with the U.S. and , most important , of independence for Japan .
