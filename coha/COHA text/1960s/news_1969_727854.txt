txt The seasoned American tourist who revisits Europe this summer may find something he has rarely encountered before . It 's entirely possible that in England he will meet some Englishmen , in France some Frenchmen and in Italy some Italians . For many Europeans who spent previous summers visiting each other 's countries seem likely to stay home this year . They 're changing their vacation plans because of the rising cost of touring another country  --  up an estimated 5 ' ; ' : to on average , from 1968  --  and because of the drastic restrictions several countries have placed on how much money their citizens can spend abroad . This does n't necessarily mean that European vacation resorts will be less crowded this year ; at many the crowd will merely be less cosmopolitan . The French government tourist office , for example , says that " on the French Riviera and in southern France generally , hoteliers report a big rush of summer bookings ? not from foreign tourists but from Frenchmen . " Biggest Trade Item Still , the prospect of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with - good reason . Spending by international tourists in all countries last year totaled around $14.5 billion , making tourism the bigest single item in world trade . Several European countries depend heavily on tourist spending to keep their international accounts balanced and their economies prosperous . Tourism is the biggest source of foreign-currency earnings for Portugal and Italy , and it accounts for 10% of Austria 's national income . Moreover , contrary to legend , most tourists , even to Europe , are ? lot Americans . Indeed , it 's estimated that only 2% of the 103 million tourists who flocked through Europe last summer were Americans ; most were Europeans . Britain and Spam , for example , get more tourists from France than from any other country ; no fewer than seven million Frenchmen visited Spain last year , accounting for a third of all tourists to that country . It 's unlikely , though , that so many Frenchmen will stream abroad this year . The French government has imposed a limit of $200 a year on vacation spending by its citizens outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money from France , at a time when the franc is the leading candidate for devaluation among European currencies . Wiping Out Pompeii Trip Emile Blois , a middle-aged Paris taxi driver , figures he could make a planned trip to Naples and Pompeii and stay within the $200 allowance . But he does n't think the Italian holiday is worth the trouble . " I just love to travel , " he says , " but you could n't buy a glass of cognac without worrying about spending too much of the travel allowance , so I 'd rather not go . Instead , I 'll have to stay in France . " Britain has slapped an even tighter limit on foreign spending ; its citizens are allowed to spend only $120 a year on nonbusiness trips outside the country . Like the French franc , the British pound has been weak and subject to incessant devaluation rumors  --  even though it was devalued by 14.3% only 18 months ago . " The miserly travel allowance made our trip to Austria impossible , " says John Edwards , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and family to the Tyrolean Alps this summer . He will be vacationing on the Cornwall beaches in southwest England . Such restrictions have drawn sharp criticism  --  especially from countries heavily dependent on tourism to balance their international payments . " We strongly resent curbs on travel spending " by other countries , says an Austrian government official . " Travel restrictions imposed by governments are equivalent to restrictions on the import of goods " in international economic impact , he contends . Even Greece Nevertheless , such restrictions are spreading . The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) in Paris reports Light restrictions on citizens ' travel spending are now in effect in at least six of its 21 member countries . Besides Britain and France , they are Japan , Iceland , Turkey and , of all nations , Greece , which itself counts on spending by foreign tourists for vital revenues . Europeans whose governments do n't restrict their spending on foreign vacations still will find inflation in most of the countries they might visit a powerful inducement to stay home . " Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe than a year ago , " says a travel expert in London . Some sample price boosts : One-way tickets between Frankfurt and other European centers on Lufthansa , the German airline , are up 3.7% to 5.4% . A bus tour of Rome , taking in St. Peter 's , the Pantheon , the Colosseum and other sights , now costs $3.20 , up from $3 last year . London taxi fares are 14% higher than a year ago , and a dinner with wine at the Baron of Beef near St. Paul 's Cathedral costs $7 , against $5.50 for last year 's tourists . In Greece , it costs a lot more even to applaud a night club act . Patrons of Athens night spots traditionally express approval of an entertainer 's routine by smashing plates . A customer smashing enough plates to register real enthusiasm this year will be charged about $2 , against 70 cents a year ago . Some efforts are under way to hold down costs for tourists . Greece has cut fares up to 50% for passengers traveling on the national railroads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian hotels are now adopting the all-inclusive room rates , including service charges and taxes , that they have long resisted . Such moves may be too little and too late , though , at least for European travelers . The high prices do n't seem to be deterring more affluent American tourists . and European travel officials are counting on attracting more Americans than the 1.9 million who visited Europe last year . There are some signs that they will ; a London spokesman for Pan-American World Airways reports bookings from the U.S. to London are running 10% to 15% ahead of a year ago .. Whether any rise in American tourism will be enough to offset the expected drop in travel by Europeans is questionable , however . In general the expectation is for at best a continued slowing of the growth in tourism . Even last year , world-wide tourist travel grew only 3r : ; , compared with gains of 6% in 1967 and 13% in 1986 . " Tourism generally seems to have reached a leveling-off point following a tremendous postwar spurt , " says an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eberhard , president of the German Tourist Association in Frankfurt , goes further . " The boom in tourist business is a thing of the past , " he says . " Not Us " - To be sure , European tourist officials are exceedingly reluctant to admit to the possibility that tourist travel to their own countries may drop . Italian officials do concede privately that they will be happy if their country 's tourist receipts match last year 's $1.42 billion , and the Portuguese National Tourist Office can muster no more optimism about 1969 tourist business than to say it " should not be too bad . " But several other countries doggedly predict increases , sometimes big ones . Lord Geddes , chairman of the British Travel Association , for instance , says Britain 's prospects for attracting foreign visitors " have never been so good . " His group predicts " London 's swinging image " will help draw 4.5 million visitors to Britain this year , up from four million in 1968 . Spain officially predicts 20.5 million visitors this year , up 6.5% from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top the record $144 million of 1966 ; they dropped in 1967 and 1968 . Independent travel experts express skepticism about all three predictions . " The French travel-spending curbs might easily keep many French tourists away from Britain , " says one travel specialist . Spain vs . Greece Spanish travel men also wonder if their country can attract as many French tourists as last year . And OECD officials imply that if Spain draws many new visitors from other lands , Greece will have added difficulty meeting its " highly optimistic " tourist goals . Spain and Greece compete with each other for the many tourists who seek a relatively inexpensive vacation under the Mediterranean sun . But while costs of applauding in Athens night clubs and other items have been rising in Greece , devaluation of the peseta has reduced the cost of a vacation in Spain for foreigners . OECD men think this may divert some tourist traffic from Greece to Spain . The interest of European tourists in a lowcost vacation  --  even if it is n't under a warming sun  --  is indicated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agents have begun offering . The tour is to glacier-bound Greenland . The cost Is $400 . And , says one travel man , " inquiries have been pouring in. "
