txt Thundershowers dropped 1.08 inches of rain on Chicago in little more than an hour yesterday afternoon . Strong winds accompanying the rain downed power lines and trees . The temperature fell 17 degrees , from 84 to 67 , at Midway airport between 4 and 5 p. m. after the storm hit . Lightning struck in several parts of the city but little damage was reported . Wires were reported down in about 50 south side locations . A power failure caused by the storm occurred in Oak Park in the area bounded by Jackson boulevard , Harrison street , and Oak Park and Ridgeland avenues . The failure , which lasted half an hour , apparently was caused by an electrical fire in a sewer in Forest Park .
