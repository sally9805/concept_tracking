NEARLY a year has passed since Senator Goldwater by no means singlehandedly turned the Republican Party into what was inevitably described as a shambles . Now a new national chairman is trying to tidy up ; a new House leader struggles to present " positive alternatives " to the Great Society ; task forces and study groups have produced dozens of party position papers ; and here and there , like forget-me-nots pushing up through the rubble , Republican candidates are catching the public eye-and valiantly striving to grow into political sunflowers . And the state of the party is-a shambles . <P> There is a lot going on in the G.O.P.-and on the surface most of it sounds like trouble . In California , where Democratic Governor Pat Brown appears vulnerable for next year , there is a veritable chasm between the so-called left and right wings of the Republican Party , and some Republicans are saying , and sounding as though they meant it , that they would rather vote for Brown than for a primary-winning Republican of the other faction . In New York City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this year 's vote for mayor , a considerable part of it at the expense of Republican and Liberal Party Candidate John Lindsay . Michigan 's Governor George Romney , who refused to support Goldwater , now has national aspirations of his own , and is traveling about the nation making inspirational speeches about party unity ; many unforgiving Republicans are positively smacking their lips in anticipation of the revenge they will take on him for his defection in ' 64 . In Miami , Pennsylvania 's Governor William Scranton recently urged Republicans to isolate the " radical fringe , " presumably meaning the John Birch Society . In Arizona , a syndicated columnist named Goldwater said that he thought the party might do better to exorcise its " left side . " <P> Carried to its extreme , this Republican demonstration of the admirable belief that a true conviction should be stoutly upheld can lead only to the loss of elections . The fearful prospects led Richard Nixon , the one active Republican leader who seems acceptable to all factions , to lecture that " the liberals have got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , and the conservatives have got to stop reading the liberals out of the party . " On the other hand , the ferment within the party , brought to the right conclusion at the right time , could result in a stronger party on a better road toward strength and even power . <P> <P> The Cruel Statistics <P> It will not be an easy road to find . Smothered under the blanket of Lyndon Johnson 's **27;1432;TOOLONG , the G.O.P. is statistically so far behind that many years may go by before it gets its head up . Top Republicans talk publicly of picking up 40 House seats next year ; they would happily settle for 20 , which would bring the Democrats down to a still overwhelming majority of 275 to 160 . Only by a turnover that surpasses imagination could the G.O.P. gain a bare majority of the Senate ; Republicans would have to beat all 19 Democratic Senators up for re-election next year while holding the 14 Republican seats that will be risked . In their field of greatest strength , the governorships , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their present 17 ; they could just as conceivably drop a couple .
