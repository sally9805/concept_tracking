For the Child Who Has Nothing At an international conference held at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington a small group of doctors , scientists and scholars from 20 countries met to talk about young children the one-to-five age group ? in the so-called developing countries . These pre-school youngsters constitute 25 percent of the two billion population of these nations ( compared to less than io percent of the population in this country ) , and the nutritionists tell us that seven of every ten of them suffer from some form of malnutrition . Papers presented at the conference also said that malnutrition permanently impairs physical growth and that there is now strong evidence that malnutrition and irreparable mental retardation are related . The specialists say that unless it is stemmed , the growing incidence of malnutrition will have a major effect on " what our civilization looks , thinks and acts like ? in 1984 . " The scientists are speaking , of course , of those who are strong enough to survive . Up to half the children in these countries never make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times higher than in more affluent societies . Were the death rate in the pre-school age group in Latin America as it is in our country , for example , almost a third of a million fewer youngsters would die every year . Still more graphic , in a country like Libya a mother must have five children to be reasonably certain that one will ever reach the age of 13 ; and in Vietnam , the cumulative mortality approaches 4o percent with four years of life . This is a proportion of deaths which is not reached until age bo in the United States . As if these figures are not striking enough , the highly regarded Mexican nutritionist Dr. Joaquin Cravioto says , " The true picture of child mortality due to malnutrition is still understated . " Reason for such " understatement " may well be the unscientific tabulation of mortality rates . According to Dr. Cecily Williams , the grand British lady who keynoted the conference , the job of registering deaths is often left to policemen and postmasters . " In Malaya , " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths . In one rural area it was found that deaths under the age of three were blamed on ' convulsions ' or ' crying convulsions ' . Those between three and 3o were usually ascribed to ' fever ' , and over 3o to ' senility ' . " It was Dr. Williams , incidentally , who many years ago in Africa first described the symptoms of child malnutrition and tagged to it the name of " kwashiorkor . " This word from the Ga dialect in West Africa means " the sickness the older baby gets when the new baby comes . " When the older child is replaced by the new baby at the mother 's breast , the lack of a suitable diet soon makes the first child irritable and listless . Professor Ritchie Calder of the University of Edinburgh , another participant in this month 's conference , says : " The most saddening experience I know is to look into the eyes of kwashiorkor ; it is like looking into a dark lantern , in which the glint of childhood is unlit . The muscles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stucco on a wall . The hair loses its pigment . . . . Liver damage almost always occurs . If the child survives its third year , as an untreated case , it will go through life permanently damaged , with its mental and physical development impaired . " This growth retardation , according to studies conducted in 15 countries by the National Institutes of Health , is approximately zo to 30 percent . This means that by the time the child reaches the age of 12 , he has the physical development of a normal eight year old . Just as serious in the eyes of the nutritionists as growth retardation is that malnutrition lowers resistance against infection . And once he is infected , the malnourished child is of course more susceptible to severe disease . The death rate due to measles in Guatamala , for example , is 228 times greater than in the United States . In Ecuador , it is 325 times greater . Not too long ago , the matter of " pre-school malnutrition " ( a misleading professional label , since most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ) kept only the nutritionists and pediatricians awake at night . In recent years , however , it has been giving insomnia to others also . The technical know-how exists to overcome the problem . in Mexico , for example , where increased attention is being given to small children , pre-school deaths dropped 57 percent in a decade . Some forward momentum is now sensed by many of the scientists . As suggested by one of the delegates in Washington , " We no longer seem to be trying to walk ' up ' the ' down ' escalator . " A number of conclusions are emerging , most of a long-range nature . These include nutrition education programs ( " the way to a young child 's stomach is through its mother 's mind and this is frequently blocked by grandma " ) , control of food wastage ( " food loss in India due to rats , insects , poor storage and fungi amounts annually to three times the food deficit there " ) , and , of course , family planning ( " every year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York " ) . Unfortunately , the current problems ca n't all wait for long-range solutions . Of the many approaches discussed by the experts , it was apparent that one of the easiest , quickest and least-expensive steps would be to fortify and further enrich the massive quantities of food already being shipped to the needy abroad through America 's Food For Peace Program . As part of this program , up to 75 million children are every day given some form of food supplement , much of this through CARE and the religious charitable agencies . However , " the nutritive value of these foods , " according to Food For Peace Director Reuter ( a former director of CARE himself ) , " could be considerably enhanced with simple vitamin fortification of the non-fat dry milk , and increased enrichment of the flour . Since the law creating this program was originally passed primarily as a surplus disposal measure , " Mr. Reuter said , " no legislative authority exists to use additional funds to give our food the needed boost . " A recent NIH study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year are blind for life because of Vitamin A deficiency . In Indonesia , the disease is said to " assume enormous proportions , " with hundreds of thousands of children having markedly impaired vision . Vitamin A deficiency is reportedly " widespread , " and " a grave threat to sight and survival . " One of the towering figures in this field , Dr. Nevin Scrimshaw of MIT , points out that to provide skim milk to areas already short in Vitamin A serves only to exaggerate the already existing nutritional imbalance . " The United States by sending skim milk to such areas , " he says , " runs the risk of precipitating acute Vitamin A deficiency and even blindness . This would be both inhumane and politically dangerous . " " We in the United States have it within our power to prevent this kind of thing from happening , " said Vice President-elect Hubert Humphrey in one of his final floor statements as a member of the Senate . One of the originators and long one of the staunchest supporters of Food For Peace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this at a very minor cost . . . . We ought to find a way to make this minor adjustment in our Public Law 480 program Food For Peace to fortify our donated foods . . . " The cost has been estimated , for milk as an example , at two one-hundredths of one cent per child per day . Over a year-long period , this comes to something less than seven cents per child for enough Vitamin A and D in his milk to prevent possible blindness , to check rickets ( a Vitamin D deficiency which affects the bone structure of up to 50 percent of children in certain tropical countries ) , and increase resistance to infection . Food For Peace Director Reuter points out that aside from the obvious moral concerns related to such an issue , the US aid program has developed foreign markets for US farmers ( Japan is now the US farmers ' chief overseas customer ) , but " how can we expect a mother to buy American milk for her child when she can buy fortified milk from other countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we must weigh the cost of fortifying our Food For Peace donations against the costs which may result from the consequences if we do n't . " In East Pakistan alone , " he says , " we are speaking of 50,000 potential invalids in one year in one small part of one country , who may well end up requiring some type of major welfare as-sistance . To the budget of that country ? and the budget of this country which through its aid program supports that country ? it seems a reasonable investment to spend pennies to prevent this kind of thing . " Such fortification and enrichment of our Food For Peace donations is by no means the answer to the problem of malnutrition among so-called pre-school children , but according to Mr. Reuter , " it is a good step in that direction . We can feed them all we want when they 're six years old ? but by then it may well be too late ; the damage has been done . Their tomorrows depend on today . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
