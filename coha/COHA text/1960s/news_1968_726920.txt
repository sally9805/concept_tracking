txt WASHINGTON , Feb. ** unsung heroine of today 's drama , in which two state department officers were suddenly rescued from a state department " Siberia , " is Mrs. Janet Hite , a sweet-faced young mother , wife of one of the two condemned men . Her husband , Harry M. Hite , 42 , and his partner , Edwin A. Burkhardt , 44 , had virtually given up hope that they would ever be relieved from their exile . They regarded themselves as forgotten men , doomed to isolation until they succumbed to state department pressures and resigned . Mrs. Hite decided last week to do something about it . She called on her congressman and visited other Capitol bill offices but found little interest in her story . Then , someone suggested she call this reporter who , like many others , was disinclined at first to believe that government employes could be subjected to such treatment as she described . A visit to the " isolation ward , " as Sen. John J. Williams R. , Del. described it , and an interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report . Today , less than 48 hours after first publication of the two officers ' plight , congressional indignation had forced the state department to apologize and offer them new assignments and a transfer to livable offices . Happy , Bewildered by Sudden Events HITE AND BURKHARDT confessed themselves both happy and bewildered by the rapidity of events which ended their dark isolation of 16 months . They remained skeptical of the state department 's future attitude when today 's indignation on Capitol hill has died down . They were gratified , however , at the prospect of something to do even tho they will not be allowed to resume the profession of security officer for which they trained long years . This is ultra-sensitive work  --  evaluating the loyalty and trustworthiness of government employes  --  which is vital to government security . The years of enforced idleness have taken their toll , they confessed . The inactivity forced upon them often became an almost unbearable agony . They were deprived for four years of the right to work at a meaningful task . For eight hours each day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to a radio , or writing memos to their superiors in futile pleas for employment . These petitions , until today , were never even acknowledged . " We could take everything  --  the ostracism , the turning away of heads of fellow employes , the incarceration in a rat-infested building  --  but the strain of idleness was beginning to wear on us , " said Hite . Have Combined Service of 46 Years WE CAME TO REALIZE that this was the probable purpose of the treatment  --  to break us down mentally until we started shouting at each other . It did n't work but , we do n't inow whether it might not have , eventually . " The two men have a combined government service of 46 years . Hite is a grade 13 civil service employe , annual salary $15,307 . Burkhardt is a grade 12 , salary $12,989 . Conscientious to a fault , they were disturbed by the realization that they had collected in four years a total of about $113,000 in salaries for which they performed no useful services . This dissipation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  until today : - " We know that every government worker was watching the eventual outcome of our treatment , " Hite remarked . " We hope that today 's developments will help encourage those who still believe that a federal worker has the right to give honest testimony before a congressional committee , without subsequent harassment . " Sometimes , during the last four years , we found it hard to believe that all this was  --  appening in the United States . I guess it ca n't as long as Congress and the press are around to expose what is ping on . "
