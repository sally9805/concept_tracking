<P> The root source of a modern Christian morality , says Roman Catholic Bishop Francis Simons of Indore , India , is not so much the Bible or natural law as the consensus of what constitutes " the good or welfare of man , in society and individually . " In the current issue of the U.S. theological quarterly Cross Currents , Dutch-born Bishop Simons uses his consensus theory to propose a radical revision of ethics that would make certain violations of generally accepted moral principles reasonable exceptions to the rule rather than sinful inconsistencies . <P> Simons rejects Bible-based morality on the grounds that Jesus himself imposed no detailed code of behavior , but rather gave a general injunction that man should live according to the highest standards and seek perfection through love . He likewise feels that the conventional Catholic approach to natural law is too abstract and impersonal . The traditional natural-law moralist would call lying a sin because it perverts the purpose of speech , which is communication . Simons ' general-welfare theory suggests a more plausible reason , similar to the thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be gravely harmed if telling lies were generally committed . " <P> Constants &; Change . " When the general convictions of mankind and the insights of its wisest men agree , " Simons argues , " we can be reasonably sure that they embody a substantially correct view of the contents of natural moral law . " Some moral law is virtually self-evident and thus constant through history-for example , respect for life and property . But there has also been change and development in man 's understanding of morality . The modern consensus establishes as sinful certain behavior patterns , such as slavery and polygamy , that previous ages accepted as moral . Now , Simons believes , a consensus is developing outside the church that permits abortions when a mother 's life is in danger , birth control and even sterilization for parents whose family welfare would be threatened by another child , and suicide " where it is foreseen that otherwise great harm will be caused . " <P> Masturbation is another act that Simons thinks should be deplored in general but condoned under particular circumstances . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western societies go through long periods of protracted sexual tension . With the welfare of man as his criterion , Simons suggests that it is psychologically better for them to release this tension by masturbation than to prolong it at the risk of developing a morbid preoccupation with sex . The Catholic church 's inflexibility in condemning remarriage after divorce is also not in accord with the modern view of human welfare . All efforts should be made to discourage and prevent divorce , Simons says , but he also believes that it would be better to permit remarriage in the case of deserted spouses who can not live a life of continence .
