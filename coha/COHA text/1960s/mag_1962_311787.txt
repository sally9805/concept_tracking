To get away from the daily hurly-burly that sometimes invades even the Vatican . Pope John XXIII has a lofty new retreat in which to meditate . The top three floors of the 9th century tower of San Giovanni , built by Pope Leo IV as a defense against marauding Saracens , have been fitted out with heaters for winter and air conditioning for summer , divided into a foyer , a circular salon opening on a library and studio , a dining room , bedroom and chapel . And from the wide terrace behind the battlements of the 100-ft. - high tower , the Pontiff has a splendid view of the Eternal City . So pleasant is the prospect that the Pope may elect to spend every summer there . <P> Few poets die wealthy , and lower-case Poet E. E. Cummings , who died three weeks ago , was no exception . In his will , signed with upper-case capitals and filed for probate in Manhattan Surrogate 's Court , he left personal possessions valued at a mere $15,000 to his wife Marion , and " suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two close friends whatever " they 'd enjoy remembering me by . " <P> To shouts of dobro pozhalovat ( welcome ) from crowds of flower-bearing Russians , Composer Igor Stravinsky , 80 , arrived at Moscow 's Sheremetyevo Airport and set foot on his native soil for the first time in 52 years . For the frail , cane-carrying composer , whose symphonic ballets were branded " corrupt and bourgeois " during Stalin 's day , it was an emotional homecoming . " I left Czarist Russia and have returned to the Soviet Union , which I greet , " said Stravinsky in Russian . " It is a great joy . " After a tender meeting with a niece he had known only through an exchange of letters , Stravinsky was helped into a limousine and whisked in a motorcade to his hotel , where , fortified with vodka and caviar , he worked over the scores for three concerts with the Moscow Symphony Orchestra , which will play excerpts from his modernistic The Fire Bird and Petmshka . <P> As the first guest on a new Canadian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost no time unsettling citizens on both sides of the border . Kissing off Canada as " a great chunk of geography limping painfully toward anonymity , " he quickly turned to a much broader subject-Susskind . " I would like very much to go into politics . " he said . President ? " No Jewish person can be President of the United States . A Catholic just barely made it . " Senator ? Yes . " I 'd like to go into that solemn chamber , and make some sense . " <P> In a somber . 4OO-word statement printed in his own London Times , Baron Astor of Hever , 76 , who was born in New York City and is the great-great-grandson of fur-trading Millionaire John Jacob Astor , announced that though he loves England dearly and will remain a loyal citizen , he simply can not afford to die there . Because a newly adopted finance act imposes an 80% death duty on real property held overseas by any British subject who dies at home . Lord Astor , who owns an estimated $40 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last years in Southern France . " It is my firm hope , " he wrote , " that as a result , my descendants will be enabled to continue to uphold the family traditions and responsibilities . "
