What 's playing at the Roxy ? I 'll tell you what 's playing at the Roxy : A picture about a Minnesota man , so in love with a Mississippi girl that he sacrifices everything and moves all the way to Biloxi-that 's what 's playing at the Roxy ! - Guys and Dolls <P> Opening night of the Roxy in 1927 was an event that bedazzled New Yorkers . The $11 million theater was so big and luxurious that the only billing it thought fitting was " The Cathedral of Motion Pictures . " As the cathedral 's doors opened , 125 special policemen held back the mobs that strained for a look at their flicker favorites . Among the 6,000 first-nighters were New York 's Mayor Jimmy Walker , Harold Lloyd , Charlie Chaplin and Gloria Swanson , star of the cathedral 's first attraction , The Love of Sunya . As the audience settled back in the plush mohair seats , an actor in a monk 's robe appeared on stage , spread his arms and said : " Let there be light . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musicians , bathed in the glare of spotlights , played The Star-Spangled Banner . <P> The Roxy was never able to top its premiere . Though every major Hollywood film star made love on its screen , though its stage shows ranged from dog acts to the New York Philharmonic , the theater usually had trouble paying its bills . In 1931 Samuel ( " Roxy " ) Rothafel , the free-spending impresario who had conceived the Roxy , jumped to the Radio City Music Hall just up the street , was soon presenting shows that out-glittered those at the theater named after him . Upkeep for the high-stepping chorus of Roxyettes , the huge orchestra and the three pipe organs was so high that the Roxy had to operate at near capacity to turn a profit . Even after overhead was cut down , poor pictures and finally television kept the theater in a precarious financial position . <P> Last week the last act came for the Roxy . Manhattan Real Estate Tycoon William Zeckendorf announced that for $5,000,000 he had bought the theater from Rockefeller Center Inc. , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it down to build a $12.5 million , 900-room , 600-car-garage addition to his Taft Hotel , making it one of the largest hotels ( 2,500 rooms ) in New York . Zeckendorf , who , like other large realty operators , has had trouble rounding up all the financing needed to construct his 2,000-room Zeckendorf Hotel , is still negotiating the financing for his newest project. - But he argues that it is a sound risk because the Taft 's annual occupancy rate is 95% of capacity . He is confident its parking facilities will attract tourists who would normally stay at motels outside the city rather than face New York traffic . <P> <P> * Columnist Walter Winchell reports that Zeckendorf and his son were riding through Manhattan when William Jr . pointed to a skyscraper and said , " Dad , I hear that building can be bought for $50 million . " " Yes , " replied Zeckendorf , " but they want $50,000 cash . "
