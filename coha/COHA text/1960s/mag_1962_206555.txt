In some ways Richard Nixon symbolized the American dream . Of humble beginnings , he almost won the highest honor the U.S. can offer . He was elected a U.S. Representative at 33 , a Senator at 37 , Vice President at 39 , and at 47 he became the Republican nominee for President . And yet , barring a miracle , his political career ended last week . He was only 49 . But something had gone wrong . Perhaps he had risen too far too fast . <P> There could be little question about Nixon 's abilities-yet they earned him almost as many enemies as admirers . He came to national attention as the House investigator who caught Alger Hiss ; for that very achievement , he was to suffer much abuse . As Vice President , he served with energy and dignity , often representing the U.S. abroad with courage beyond the call of duty . In his 1960 drive for the presidency , he began as the candidate of experience , but his once-sure political touch left him and he ran a bad campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet they insisted that his character was flawed . As of last week , his admirers could only agree . <P> Ridiculous Issue . Nixon 's political death came not in his defeat for Governor of California by incumbent Democrat Pat Brown but in his manner of meeting it . Brown is neither a great personality nor a great statesman , but he makes the most of what he has . Against him , Nixon decided to make domestic Communism the big issue ; but the notion that Brown was soft on Communism was ridiculous . Sensing defeat , Nixon flailed out in a last-minute fury . On election eve , he appeared on television-with his wife and two teen-age daughters at his side-claimed in persecuted tones that he had been the victim of the worst smear cam paign in California history . <P> As of that moment , the election results were foregone . The next day . while Republican Senator Thomas Kuchel was winning by some 700,000 votes , Nixon was losing by nearly 300,000 . And the morning after the election Nixon wrote his own political obituary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press conference to announce that Nixon was conceding defeat . Klein said that Nixon himself would not appear-whereupon Nixon strode into the room and started talking . <P> Petulant Praise . Said Nixon , in words that were too small of spirit to make for real tragedy : " Now that all the members of the press are so delighted that I have lost , I 'd like to make a statement of my own . " He spoke in petulant praise of his opponent : " I believe Governor Brown has a heart , even though he believes I do not . I believe he is a good American , even though he feels I am not . " For 17 minutes he went on , talking about national issues , but returning repeatedly to his feelings about the press . Almost incoherently , he concluded : <P> " As I leave you I want you to know-just think how much you 're going to be missing . <P> " You wo n't have Nixon to kick around any more , because , gentlemen , this is my last press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have welcomed the opportunity to test wits with you . . . <P> " But . unlike some people , I 've never canceled a subscription to a paper , and also I never will .
