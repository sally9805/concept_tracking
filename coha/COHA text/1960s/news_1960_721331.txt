txt There are surprises on Satellites all sides these days . and Two of the latest have Dolphins come from scientists . A radio-astronomer in California , R. N. Bracewell , has announced his belief that a satellite from another planet may be in orbit around our earth . The other surprise is from the Virgin Islands , where a Navy researcher , John C. Lilly , has stated that the dolphin may be the equal , perhaps the superior , of man in brain power . The report on the Suspension hypothetical satellite of is perhaps the least Belief surprising of the two . The idea that someone from outer space might be spinning an object around our globe is a startling one . But it 's a fact that we 've all suspended belief , to a good extent , where the outer-space story is concerned . We 'll almost believe anything , since it 's all so incredible anyway . In fact , the British scientist who recently pooh-poohed the idea of interplanetary landings in the near future seemed a bit old-fashioned in the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's position in Position the animal hierarchy Challenged is more startling than the hypothetical satellite . No one has ever cast doubt on our leadership before , except in misanthropic moments . The Navy 's sober finding is that the dolphin has a highly organized society and a good means of communication . If we men are sharp enough we may be able to learn to communicate with the dolphin . There is the possibility that the dolphin may learn to communicate with us first . One dolphin made a brilliant attempt to do so , according to Dr. Lilly ; he repeated the numbers " three-twothree " in a Donald-Duckish voice after a man had said them in his presence . The dolphin , the findings show , can " solve difficulties beautifully . " This is an ability not too common among men . Once we 've learned to talk to these fellow-thinkers , we might make use of their expertise in this area , if they are willing . We would begin with small difficulties first , of course . It will be a long time before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tank . It may be , in view Reassessing of these developthe ments , that we will Animals have to reassess our whole attitude toward the animal world . We may have to take a very thoughtful look around . Up to now , several things the chimpanzee has shown himself capable of doing have been rated as the highest ability in the animal world . One of these was the trick of stacking boxes . When the boxes were stacked the chimp could spring to the top of them and , before they toppled , grab the clump of bananas that was the prize for the successful effort . Very smart , we humans said , and we credited the chimp with having a mentality equal to the human infant . If our own assumed superiority had n't got in the way we might have speculated on the possibility that ' the chimp was bored rather than challenged by this whole enterprise ; since we did n't give him any other means , he had to stack the boxes to get the bananas . We might have done the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the boxes tumbled down we could have picked one of them up and hurled it at the scorer . I ? animals lack huOur mans ' capacity for Monopoly righteous indignation , on Vanity they also lack our enormous and inexhaustible vanity . If we look around with a new honesty at our animal brethren , it may do us a world of good . We may conclude that in many situations we have been indulging our conceits ; we may conclude that often we have been colossal show-offs , holding our loaded IQ tests over creation and scoring ourselves on top . Meanwhile the other creatures , perhaps just as smart and definitely not as vain , may have been wisely letting things take their course and seeking the kind of harmony advocated by Plato . We may well conclude , as we look about us with new respect , that we have been lucky to have been allowed to stay in the saddle for so long . And we may realize that we had better step to it if we wish to hold our own . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure those IQ tests do n't get out of our hands .
