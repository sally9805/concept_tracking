When a retired statesman writes the story of his career , he almost invariably portrays a situation in which the author is seen as the hero and the other actors have only supporting roles . But last week , as excerpts from his memoirs began to appear in the London Times , it was clear that Britain 's Sir Anthony Eden intended to break this familiar pattern by offering his readers a cautionary tale dominated by " the bad guy . " With only six installments in print , Britain 's onetime Tory Prime Minister was already cocking his arm for a Sunday punch at the late John Foster Dulles-the man Eden considers largely responsible for the 1956 Suez crisis , which brought Eden 's long political career to a calamitous end . <P> The Unmailed Letter . Eden begins by coldly surveying Dulles ' self-avowed 1954 " brinkmanship " during the last days of the Indo-China war . Dulles first raised the possibility of U.S. military intervention soon after the siege of Dienbienphu began . He was pessimistic about the French , says Eden , and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The U.S. was considering sending air and naval units to help the French , provided that 1 ) France promised to give the Indo-Chinese states their independence , and 2 ) Britain and other U.S. allies would support the U.S. The British answer , says Eden , was no-unless the impending Geneva peace talks failed . Sir Winston Churchill " summed up the position by saying that what we were being asked to do was to assist in misleading Congress into approving a military operation , which would in itself be ineffective , and might well bring the world to the verge of a major war . " <P> Eden describes a meeting in Paris shortly before the fall of Dienbienphu , when Dulles handed a letter offering U.S. armed aid in Indo-China to French Foreign Minister Georges Bidault . Dulles asked Bidault to read it and decide whether he wanted it sent to him officially . ( The point : if Bidault said no , it would then be legitimate , by diplomatic standards , for all hands to deny that any such offer had been made . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air strike at Dienbienphu on April 28 , 1954 , but was deterred by British objections . ( Dulles , Eden says , later minimized the possibility of U.S. military involvement and attributed all the furor to Admiral Arthur W. Radford , " whom he was inclined to criticize . " ) But the fact that the 1954 Geneva Conference finally ended in the negotiated partition of Indo-China Eden clearly regards as his personal triumph , achieved against Dulles ' will . <P> Whose Version ? Unhappily aware that Eden 's most controversial charges-those dealing with Dulles ' role in the Suez crisis-were still to come , most U.S. and British officials last week tactfully avoided comment on the memoirs . A notable exception was Dwight Eisenhower who at his weekly press conference declared that " there was never any plan for military intervention in Indo-China developed to be put into execution . " The President tempered his denial by adding that Eden was " not an irresponsible person " and undoubtedly was " writing the story as he believes it to be . "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
