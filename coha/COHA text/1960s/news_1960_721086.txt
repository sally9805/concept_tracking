txt Every now and then Wanted : some item in the news Economics suggests that what Lessons the country needs is not a good five-cent cigar but a simple , basic course in economics for taxpayers , housewives , buyers , sellers , white collar workers , labor union members and officers , elected representatives of the people and , in fact , everybody . The news item at hand is a report on a meeting of the A. F. L.-C . I. 0 . Executive Council ; it might well have been , in so far as the subject of this essay is concerned , a meeting of mayors , schoolteachers or manufacturers or one of many organizations that have been called , rightly or wrongly , pressure groups . First , it is worth A Principle noting that some Now things which once Accepted were highly controversial are today accepted without question , as , for example , the Federal minimum wage law , specifying that workers producing goods sold in interstate commerce must be paid one dollar an hour . The A. F. L.-C . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone in its views  --  is seeking an increase in the present minimum wage on the ground that a raise will bolster the nation 's buying power . Some manufacturers oppose the proposed increase , stating that they can not afford to add to their overhead . The point is that long ago they gave up fighting the basic principle of a Federal minimum wage  --  once highly controversial  --  and now are resigned to its existence ; what they are against now is an increase in the minimum . No one these days Why Not seems concerned Set about this : if it is Prices , Too ? economically and socially sound to have wages established by the Federal Government , it logically follows that prices also should be set by the Government . ( As a matter of fact , the Federal Government does set prices on many farm commodities , and the resultant tangled skein has become a political issue of no small importance . ) But it will be remembered what happened when the Office of Price Administration attempted to control prices after the need for price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0 . P. A. directives and amendments to directives , and those in the market places , will recall the near-chaos and the maldistribution of goods that resulted . Secondly , it is A Comment worth noting that on Federal apparently a majorSpending ity of citizens do not cringe when a group such as the A. F. L.-C . I. 0 . Executive Council ( cited merely as a recent and convenient example ) calls for more " government " spending , for schools , hospitals , community facilities and housing . Today , most of the opposition to such a declaration will be based on total expenditures and not on the principle that such expenditures are , from a sound economic , social and governmental standpoint , wrong  --  although as recently as a quarter century ago the whole principle was being strongly opposed . No one , for example , seems to be upset that the Federal Government plans to contribute toward a " rehabilitation " of an area along the " Main Line " of Philadelphia , one of the wealthiest stretches of real estate on the eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in effect the taxpayers of California , Oregon , Washington and- other states where the " Main Line " may never have been heard of are being taxed to pay for this " rehabilitation " project . Thirdly , it is evi-President 's dent that few people Uphill these days identify Battle themselves with " the Government . " The people are the Government ; the Government 's money is their money , extracted from them in various ways often not clearly understood by them ( how many know what the Federal tax is on a package of cigarettes , a bottle of bourbon , a telephone call , an automobile ? ) . President Eisenhower is attempting to make people more aware of the economics of government ; but it must be said that , with the weight of years of acceptance of all sorts of aid from " the Government " working against him , he is waging an uphill struggle . He can not teach , at this date , elementary economics to two hundred million people who seem to have forgotten that what " the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each of us , or that the relationship between industrial productivity and governmental expenditures is not always what it seems to be .
