" Outside the church there is no salvation " is a venerable teaching that Roman Catholic theologians are trying to forget in the ecumenical age . Perhaps the only priest who takes the maxim literally is outside the church himself : the Rev. Leonard Feeney , 67 , a defrocked Jesuit who in the ' 30s and ' 40s was one of the nation 's best-known Catholic theological popularizers and convert seekers . Feeney was excommunicated in 1953 for disobeying his religious superiors and refusing to accept a Holy Office decision that non-Catholics who worshiped God in good faith could be saved . <P> <P> Convinced that his cause was right , the dynamic , white-haired priest argued his case on Boston Common every Sunday afternoon for nearly six years after his **29;3991;TOOLONG a fiery defense of " true Catholicism " with attacks on Protestants and Jews . Then , in 1958 , Feeney moved his cadre of followers , who called themselves the " Slaves of the Immaculate Heart of Mary , " from Cambridge to a rambling farm near Still River , a picture-book farming village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benedict 's Center to outsiders , concentrated on the spiritual disciplining of his 86 devoted Slaves , 39 of them children . <P> <P> Dogmatism &; Rigor . St. Benedict 's was almost as hard to get out of as to get into , according to testimony recently presented before the State Supreme Court . The evidence , the first public account of life at the center since the Slaves moved to Still River , came from Boston College Law Student Robert Colopy , 38 , filing suit for custody of his five children , who are still with their mother at St. Benedict 's . <P> <P> Colopy and his wife Loretta joined the center in the late 1940s , overwhelmed by Feeney 's zeal and fervor . Married in 1949 , they had five children by 1954 . Then Feeney , gradually growing more dogmatic and rigorous as his suspicions of society deepened , decreed that the Slaves were to take vows of celibacy . All children born to his followers live apart from their parents , and Feeney is in sole charge of their education . Colopy testified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mister , are you my father ? " <P> At St. Benedict 's , said Colopy , men and women live in separate houses on the farm , are forbidden to read newspapers , listen to the radio , or have any contact with the Still River townsfolk . Supporting the community by sales of his devotional and historical books , Feeney runs St. Benedict 's like a monastery , indoctrinating the Slaves with long daily lectures and sermons . According to Colopy , Feeney frequently denounces the Jews as responsible for Communism , and Protestants for subverting Latin America from the church . Although Boston 's Richard Cardinal Gushing suspended him from his priestly functions , Feeney continues to celebrate Mass and hear confessions . He forbids the Slaves to attend Catholic services in Still River . <P> <P> Slavery to Freedom . Two years ago , after failing to persuade his wife to leave , Colopy wrote the Bishop of Worcester for advice . When the bish op 's reply was discovered by one of the Slaves , Colopy was condemned before the community , stripped of the black-cassock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farmhouse 's rooms .
