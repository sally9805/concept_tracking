Of all the opponents of any federal legislation to control firearms , none has been more persistent-or more effective-than the National Rifle Association , a 750,000-member organization that spends perhaps $2,000,000 a year pushing its official line in pamphlets , pressure on Congress , gun-magazine advertisements and its own publication The American Rifleman . In the face of renewed clamoring for congressional gun control action , spurred by Charles Whitman 's recent sniper rampage in Austin , Texas , the N.R.A . last week turned for a change to newspapers , buying full-page spreads in the Washington Post and the New York Times , both of which have editorialized vigorously for stronger gun laws . Over the legend , " America needs more straight shooters , " the ads picture , of all people , a rifle-toting Franklin Delano Roosevelt . <P> Part of the N.R.A . ' s membership drive to mark its 100th anniversary ( " We 're shooting for a million members " ) in 1971 , the ads accurately describe F.D.R. as an N.R.A . member who shared the organization 's concern for conservation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mention , however , is that Roosevelt ( one of seven U.S. presidents who have been shot at by would-be assassins ) , was a longtime advocate of strong gun laws . As Governor in 1932 , F.D.R. vetoed two bills that attempted to emasculate New York 's tough Sullivan Law , which remains the only state law requiring police permits for possession of handguns . During his presidency , the two major existing federal gun laws-the firearms acts of 1934 and 1938-were passed . In fact , a 1962 article in The American Riflleman took note of the late President 's desire for tough gun controls , complained that his " knowledge of firearms was not extensive . " <P> In any case , the obvious intensification of the N.R.A . ' s anti-legislation campaign may be unnecessary . In Congress , where the association maintains influential contacts and can mount a massive barrage of letters at the drop of a new gun bill , a measure sponsored by Connecticut 's Senator Thomas Dodd to curb interstate firearms traffic re mained bottled up last week in the Senate Judiciary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimming rapidly .
