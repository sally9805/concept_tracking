When Gian Carlo Menotti took over the cobbled Umbrian city of Spoleto in 1958 for his first Festival of Two Worlds , the musical fringe of Manhattan 's cocktail circuit followed him and introduced the martini to local opera buffs . Italian bluebloods rapidly caught on , and musica martini dry became the order of the day . <P> Eight festivals later , Menotti 's show has become a way of life . Nobody ( who is anybody ) comes out for a day or a single event ; one settles in for a week or the whole four-week season . " Once you get here , it 's impossible to leave , " says Countess Alice Spaulding Paolozzi , whose daughter Cristina gave the whole family a certain notoriety by posing nude and chest-high for Harper 's Bazaar . Contessa Wally Castelbarco , Toscanini 's daughter , " would n't miss it for anything , " and presides over Gian Carlo 's elegant collection of rival hostesses who yearn to be his hostesses during the season . <P> Concerts &; Cannelloni . Last week Spoleto was swinging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jet set . The earnest and the merely cultured rapidly settled into the ritual of their daily rounds : breakfast at 10 , a midday chamber concert , a five-o'clock poetry reading and then a play at the Seven O'Clock Theater . Ballet or opera was the choice of enchantments for the evening-Choreographer John Cranko 's intensely dramatic Romeo and Juliet , the swirling color of Yugoslav folk dances , or Conductor Thomas Schippers ' sonorous rendition of Verdi 's Otello . <P> The habitu follows a more calculatedly relaxed schedule : a noontime apritif in the sun-drenched Piazza del Duomo , where one was sure to see George Balanchine and the Maharani of Jaipur . Or late lunch in the Trattoria Panciolle , followed by a long siesta . The music of pianos , violins and vocalizing floats out of narrow Renaissance windows ; artists and audience are on first-name terms within hours . After dusk , international jet setters in white dinner jackets brush shoulders with gaping locals in sweatshirts at the superheated discothque . Then it is on to a 16th century vaulted cellar that serves cannelloni till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not feel sure they are really in until they have spent an evening or part of it at Menotti 's 17th century palazzo . Marvels Menotti : " I am regularly faced by an avalanche of princes , princesses , dukes and duchesses , who swarm over my house in their wonderful clothes , eating , drinking and cooking spaghetti in my kitchen . Spoleto was conceived as a small ivory turret , but has turned into a Tower of Babel. "
