( TO AUDIENCE . ) Ai n't that right . ( TO LENNY . ) You hear that ? LENNY You do have some people with you . p. 11 GLOW That is true . LENNY Ok . But think about this Luba . Picture to yourself a classroom full of teachers sitting there row after row in this room , three times a week , for three months ! There they are . There they have to be . Could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ruin those little children ? Before they go out and make those children close their minds , shut their ears and turn away from education forever ?

I 'll try to get a few things straightened out here ( POINTS TO HER HEAD . ) Cause , once these flat butt teachers begin to SEE , REALLY see and hear , REALLY hear  --  then brothers and sisters that 'll be the day these children reachin out , reachin up , their eyes shining , grabbin on to LEARNING , GROWING . Cause they want to learn so bad ,  --  and they would learn , if they did n't have to put up with so much SHIT , day after day , year after year . You hear me ?
