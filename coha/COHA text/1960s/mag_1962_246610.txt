EARTH , AIR , FIRE AND WATER ( 216 pp. ) - Alexander Eliot-Simon &; Schuster ( $5 ) . <P> <P> Anyone who dares to delve into the condition of 20th century American life is most probably doing it to earn a doctorate . Not so Author Alexander Eliot , 43 , an out-of-place , out-of-sorts , self-styled recluse who , on the pine-clad slopes of Mount Pentelikon , near Athens , pondered the question , put down his answer in the dozen meditations of this new book . <P> Winds of Legend . Anxiety in Americans , says Eliot , stems from their " basically sound awareness that pleasure is not joy . " Money can buy pleasure but joy costs more , and can be gained only through " creative work and love . " In his personal search for these elusive commodities , Eliot quit his job after 15 years as Art editor at TIME , and fled the U.S. for the Mediterranean littoral . <P> Descended from a long line of scholars headed by his great-grandfather , who was president of Harvard and editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold war and makes his study nature . What he finds-from the eagle-hung abyss below Delphi to the song of the local vegetable man-delights him , and he passes on his delight to the reader in prose that is sometimes eloquent , sometimes merely latter-day inspirational . " The stars rained down their incandescent spears in sharply patterned salvos upon Mount Pentelikon and me . Staggering a little with my face uplifted , rapt in the ringing of a dark-silver gong , I felt the winds of legend sweep between my ribs , and the fires of yearning and the tongues of dread . " <P> His eye ranges widely and perceptively over ideas and legend . It may light on the aging Admiral Christopher Columbus , appearing on deck in the darkest watch of night " hollow-eyed and crumpled , like a dry , wind-driven , scurrying leaf . " Or on Diogenes : " His castle was an upended winevat by the gates of Corinth . Alexander the Great called on him there . All radiant , the Conqueror leaned down across the neck of his white charger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Diogenes . ' Move on , ' Apollo 's man suggested . ' You 're in my light . ' " <P> Secret Heart . In trying to prove his thesis that ancient myths embody intuitive wisdom that is only now being proved out , Eliot indulges himself in many a long reach . Aphrodite , goddess of love , was able to renew her virginity simply by bathing in the sea . Now " astrophysicists relate that our life-giving sun renews its virginity also , by dint of a circular chain reaction . Every nucleus of carbon and nitrogen in the sun returns to its pure state once in five million years . " This is ingenious rather than convincing , provocative rather than wise . And in his secret heart , Eliot knows it for the word game it is . But like the juggler who danced before the altar , Eliot is giving praise to the wonder of creation in his own way .
