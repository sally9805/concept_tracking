King Kong brave as a lion <P> King Kong hundred feet tall <P> King Kong champ without trying- <P> That 's me , I 'm him . King Kong . <P> With notes as big as thunderheads starting and falling low at the end of the lyric , South Africa 's King Kong was introduced last week to the London musical stage . Drawn from life in the shantytowns around Johannesburg , it gave its West End audiences a chance to see the result of a big event in theatrical history : a superb jazz opera written , directed and produced by South African whites , scored , sung and acted by South African blacks . <P> With raw flair , swivel-hipped sex , lurid color and fundamental rhythms . King Kong has clapped a rough hand on English shoulders to lead its new audience through the shebeens ( speakeasies ) and back alleys around black Johannesburg . Great gum-booted miners dance with precision , township spivs glitter with menace as they re-enact a primeval war dance ; shebeen Delilahs strut their stuff in the sinuous dance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , swinging rhythms interweave tribal chants , European liturgical music and 1925 Dixieland stomps . Such certified-hit solos as The Earth Turns Over alternate with pennywhistle blues and a road gang 's traditional chant . Wrote Critic Bernard Levin in the Daily Express : " Certainly the show lacks the fine cutting edge that the Americans grind onto their musicals . But the more sophistication , the less vitality . And King Kong triumphs in the end by its bursting , smoking , glowing life . " <P> Against Odds . Built on a legend , the opera has itself become one .

" A hero until his death four years ago , he has since become something of an African god . He would clobber his challengers in the ring and later pulp them for good measure in the street outside .

Begging for capital punishment , he was given twelve years at hard labor and drowned himself by a prison dam . <P> To many , he symbolized the wasted power of his people in his country in his time , and his life was a readymade libretto . The music , too , was at hand-in the jazz concerts of the shantytown shebeens . A group met soon after the fighter 's suicide and planned what may have seemed an impossible production : book by white Lawyer-Novelist Harry Bloom , lyrics by white Journalist Patricia Williams , score by black Jazz Composer Todd Matshikiza , direction by white Actor-Director Leon Gluckman , a veteran of London 's Old Vic . When rehearsals began , they had to be conducted against odds : the curfew , threatening Johannesburg hooligan gangs , the rules of apartheid .
