Labor unions , unlike duchies or debts , are not customarily passed down from father to son . Except in the Carpenters ' union . From the time he was a schoolboy , Maurice Hutcheson was groomed as carefully as any prince to take over the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America , which had long been the personal fief of his father , the late William ( " Big Bill " ) Hutcheson . On his retirement in 1952 , after 36 years as the dictator of the brotherhood , Big Bill simply turned the union over to his son . <P> <P> Under Maurice 's leadership , the Carpenters continued to thrive . Membership grew to 850,000 , and the members boasted that theirs was the largest craftsmen 's union in the world . Maurice , as quiet and dutiful as his father was bombastic and domineering , rarely had anything to say .

" <P> Three years ago , silent Maurice and two other union officials were indicted on charges of bribing a state official and making a fast $81,000 in land sales for a scandal-scarred Indiana highways project . ( They later turned the money over to the state . ) When a Senate committee pressed him for the details , Maurice was as untalkative as ever : he ducked 18 questions without bothering to invoke the Fifth Amendment . Last May , Hutcheson was fined $500 and sentenced to six months in jail for contempt of Congress . Last week , his troubles multiplying like wood shavings , Maurice and Carpenters ' Vice President O. William Blaier were sentenced to 2 to 14 years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or hold public office for five years . When he heard the verdict , Maurice , as usual , had no comment .
