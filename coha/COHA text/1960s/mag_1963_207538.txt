After ten hectic days of ogling and order-writing , the 17th annual Hanover Fair closed last week , and West Germany 's tenth biggest city ( pop . 575,000 ) reverted to its usual role as the quiet capital of Lower Saxony . The world 's largest industrial fair had , as usual , racked up superlatives : more exhibits ( 5,707 ) from more nations ( 27 ) than ever before , more visitors ( 1,500,000 ) , and more revenue for such ancillary services as hotels , restaurants and airlines . But even as they tallied up their new orders , Germany 's businessmen debated whether the Hanover Fair - or , for that matter , Europe 's proliferation of industrial fairs-was really worth the bother . Said Fritz-Aurel Goergen , managing director of exhibiting Henschel ( trucks , heavy machinery ) : " There 's probably nobody who does n't recognize that this is a drain of money , manpower and time that borders on insanity . " <P> Rare Buyer . More than 20 such fairs are now held yearly , from London and Milan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of pride than pocketbook for image-conscious European firms , many of which try to exhibit at all of them , fearing that failure to exhibit might start a rumor that a company was in trouble . On such a scale , exhibitions can be very expensive ; German companies allot $375 million yearly to fairs , or about half as much as they spend on all advertising . Such smaller companies as porcelain makers or optical works may hope to recoup their outlay in sales or business contacts . But for Krupp , Henschel , Mannesmann and other heavy machinery giants , which occupy 60% of the space at the Hanover Fair , the return is measured largely in good will . The really interested customer keeps up with their products anyway , and visits the plants to inspect them ; he rarely buys anything big at such fairs . A Mannesmann executive calls the Hanover Fair " superfluous , " and a Demag executive says : " If this is n't stopped , fairs will degenerate into public relations for its own sake . " <P> Though they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like them to be held only every other year . They also want the types of exhibitors limited , and confined to showing only new products . Krupp General Manager Berthold Beitz believes that fairs force firms to be more competition-conscious , but would " just as soon show one really interesting product as ten mediocre ones . " Adds he : " If we cut out mediocrity , we will also get the kind of visitors we want ; and when that happens , we wo n't have to go to so many other fairs either . You just can not dance at every wedding . " <P> Tourists Not Wanted . Aware of such complaints , Hanover Fair directors are making some changes . This year they cut tedious public speechmaking from two days to one . They are considering raising the $2.50 admission price to eliminate tourists and curiosity seekers , but they have not reached the point of discouraging size and superlatives . For one thing , the Hanover Fair is a corporation-and ballyhoo and bigger figures over 17 years have produced an annual 4% dividend for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
