THE PRESIDENCY <P> It was largely the party for Britain 's Princess Margaret ( see Social Notes ) that brought President Johnson back to Washington last week . But he did not stay long , spent most of the time at his desk . Press Secretary Bill Moyers explained that until year 's end the President would keep his public appointments " to the absolute minimum necessary , " husbanding his energies for " deliberation , discussion , and a great deal of thinking and study . " <P> One public appointment that Johnson was determined to keep , however , was a speech before more , than 200 delegates to a two-day White House Conference on Civil Rights . " In numberless ways this Administration is acting and not just talking , " he declared , adding : " We must do more-we will do more . " <P> An immediate goal , he said , is legislation to end " injustices to Negroes at the hands of all-white juries . " For the jury is " the cornerstone of our system of justice . If its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And when that happens , justice itself is a fraud , casting off the blindfold and tipping the scales one way for whites and another way for Negroes . " <P> The President also presided over a half-hour Cabinet meeting , heard reports on Viet Nam and the economy 's continued buoyancy , conferred with aides on the 1966 budget and State of the Union messages . But Texas was beckoning , and after only five days in the capital he was back at the ranch , there to stay , quite possibly , through Christmas .
