" Calls Jobs Vital Need Senator Humphrey said that obviously the racial crisis required legal remedies to a. , . sure civil rights , but that diere would still be a problem it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presumably the new program would be an expansion of that for which Mr. Kennedy has already asked $73,000,000 for the fiscal year beginning July 1 . The House Education Comnii ttee has approved a vocationaleducation bill calling for appropriations of $102,000,000 next year , $147,000,000 the following year , $182,000,000 in the third year and $237,000,000 in the fourth year . The Justice Department . continued today efforts at mediation in the cities most torn by racial demonstrations Jackson , Miss. , Danville , Va. , and Cambridge , Md . At Jackson , Mayor Allen C. Thompson and Negro negotiators reached tentative agreement Tuesday night on some of the Negroes ' civilrights demands , but it was not certain that the accord would end demonstrations . ) The Justice Department 's position is that Negroes in the three Southern cities should not now press further demonstra tions . In Jackson and Danville they have been temporarily en joined , and officials believe they should go through the orderly process of the law . In Cambridge , violence has been so imminent that the National Guard has been called in by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with both white and Negro leaders again today in a mediation attempt . White House aides were busy today putting the final touches on the civil rights bill and the message . On Capitol Hill , it was a day of intense anticipatory maneuvering and consultation . At a luncheon , the President discussed the civil rights crisis with eight Governors ? four Democrats and four Republicans  --  and urged them to cooperate with a Federal program by initiating parallel efforts M their states . Two nationally known Republican Governors , Mark 0 . Hatfield of Oregon and William W. Scranton of Pennsylvania , pledged full support for the President 's program . The Senator majority leader , Mike Mansfield of Montana , and the minority leader , Everett Dirksen of Illinois , met in both morning and afternoon as they continued trying to reach agreement on a bill that they could jointly sponsor . Mr. Mansfield also met with Mr. Humphrey . The 14-member Senate Republican Policy Committee met at lunch to hear Senator Dirksen 's views and to engage in a general discussion . No common position was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that the Senate would have two bills before it ? the Administration bill , sponsored by Senator Humphrey and his ' Republican opposite number , Senator Thomas H. Kuchel of California , and a " leadership " bill , sponsored by Senators Mansfield and Dirksen . Senator Mansfield told reporters that he and Mr. Dirksen had achieved a " large area of agreement . " Senator Humphrey ' and some other Senators reported during the day that the only substantial difference between the Administration and leadership bills would be the omission in the latter of Federal enforcement power to prevent discrimination in privately owned public facilities , such as motels and stores . Yesterday Mr. Dirksen made ' known that such power , which the Administration believes es3ential , was a bone in his throat . Senator Humphrey confident- ly predicted that Mr. Dirksen would have no difficulty in supporting the Administration 's other proposals , including giving the Attorney General authority to initiate suits to speed school desegregation . This prospect was somewhat - clouded , however , after the luncheon discussion of the - Senate Republican Policy Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman , said it was his " guess " that a majority of those present agreed with him in opposing " the principle that the Attorney General can go all over the United States starting suits on his own caprice or whim . " Unless Republican sentiment undergoes a change as the result of developments this summer , it was agreed on Capitol Hill that the President would not get power to bar segregation in privately owned public facilities  --  at least not in the form he is expected to propose . It was predicted that the Administration would finally abandon this request , or accept a much watered-down provision , because it must depend upon 22 to 25 Republican votes to impose closure against the expected filibuster by Southern Democrats . After the White House luncheon for the Governors , Republican Gov . James A. Rhodes of Ohio parried reporters ' questions by saying he did not know what was in the bill . Gov . Albertis S. Harrison , Democrat of Virginia , said he was still opposed to civil rights legislation . Other Governors present were Jack Campbell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrat of Kentucky ; John Love , Republican of Colorado , and Mr. Tawes , Democrat of Maryland . According to Congressional sources , these are the main elements in the Administration 's civil rights bill , apart from job training : ( 1Privately owned public facilities . There will probably be a cut-off point for Federal enforcement power against segregation , based on annual income , with small enterprises exempt . Voting . There will be several proposals for speeding voting rights cases , including provision for Negroes to vote pending outcome of legal tests of their right to register . A sixth grade education would be re garded as presumptive proof o literacy where literacy tests art imposed . JSchools . Power for the At . torney General to initiate suit ( for desegregation . Before the Attorney General could act , it would have to be shown that a complainant was too poor to conduct his own suit or was . in danger of suffering physical harm . 9Government jobs . The President will propose that his Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity be given statutory status . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industries with Government contracts .
