Since 1949 , when Democrat G. Mennen Williams became Governor , Michigan 's Democrats have controlled the state 's executive department while rural Republicans ruled the legislature . But last week , the long , often paralyzing standoff between the Republican legislature and Democratic administration showed signs of ending . In an election of delegates to a constitutional convention next month at Lansing , the G.O.P. engineered its best statewide showing in years . <P> Michiganders of both parties have long recognized the need for constitutional reform . The current constitution was writ ten in 1908 , has been amended 67 times , now runs 13,000 words longer than the U.S. Constitution , and is cluttered with archaic provisions , including one which puts a $250,000 ceiling on the state debt .

With 144 delegates to be chosen-one for each seat in the legislature-they put together a slate of workaday politicians , counted on organization to pull their candidates through . The Republicans , on the other hand , pulled out all stops . Where they had spent only $34,000 on last spring 's election , they earmarked $75,000 for this campaign . Instead of depending on politicians , the party drafted such leading Michigan citizens as American Motors Corp . President George Romney and Michigan State University President John A. Hannah to run as delegates . <P> Last week , the Republican strategy paid off handsomely . Of the 144 seats , the G.O.P. took 99 , including 21 in districts where the vote is ordinarily Democratic . Even the Democratic fortress of Wayne County ( Detroit ) suffered in the sweep ; Republican delegates won eight of the 45 openings there . Encouraged by the outcome , Republicans looked forward to next autumn 's gubernatorial campaign . Cried G.O.P. State Chairman George Van Peursem : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
