In a small church of a copper-belt town in Northern Rhodesia , Dag Hammarskjold lay in state . <P> His slight body , in a mahogany casket covered with the blue-and-yellow flag of Sweden , rested amid a sea of fresh flowers in St. Andrews ' United Church of Ndola . Four sentries stood at attention , as those who could reach the remote outpost paid their last respects . Among them was the man Hammarskjold had flown to Ndola to see : Katanga 's stubborn President Moise Tshombe , whose troops were battling U.N . forces less than 100 miles away . Dressed in a grey suit and somber tie , Tshombe walked in briskly , placed a wreath of white lilies on the coffin , stood motionless for a full minute , bowed and walked out . " I knew him as a man with whom I could talk freely , " he said earlier . " C'est triste pour moi . " <P> Unexpected War . The events surrounding Hammarskjold 's fatal flight to Ndola were nearly as bizarre as the Congo political scene itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched in agony for four days as the fighting in Katanga grew worse . The U.N . force was stymied , and there was growing danger that the left-wing army of Congolese Vice Premier Antoine Gizenga might invade Katanga and start in earnest the civil war Hammarskjold had acted to avoid . <P> From his temporary headquarters on the sixth floor of the U.N . ' s Le Royale building in Leopoldville , Hammarskjold cabled Tshombe suggesting a meeting in Ndola to arrange a ceasefire . That afternoon Tshombe agreed . <P> Shortly after 4 p.m. , Hammarskjold and his party of 15 climbed aboard the Albertina , a white DC-6 used by the U.N . in the Congo . Hammarskjold 's main concern , on takeoff , was ominous : his plane had to cross territory controlled by a marauding Katanga jet fighter known as " The Lone Ranger . " The pilot , thought to be Rhodesian or an English-speaking Belgian , had been terrorizing U.N . garrisons since the beginning of the fighting , had even made strafing passes at a press conference given by U.N . Katanga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hammarskjold ordered elaborate precautions to stay away from The Lone Ranger . His flight was detoured to bring the Albertina within range of the marauder only after dark , and the big plane kept strict radio silence all the way . In addition , 15 airfields in the Congo and the Rhodesias had been alerted for a possible emergency landing . <P> Tshombe had arrived in Ndola in the late afternoon and remained at the airport waiting for Hammarskjold . At 10:40 p.m. , a plane bearing British Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Lord Lansdowne , who had agreed to act as intermediary , landed at Ndola . ( Newsmen , mistaking him for Hammarskjold , sent out a flash that the Secretary-General had landed on schedule . ) At 11:10 p.m. , Tshombe and Lansdowne left the airport , and went to their quarters to sleep . Hammarskjold 's plane was still unheard from .
