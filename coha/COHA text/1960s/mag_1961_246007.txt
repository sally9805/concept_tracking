Seldom had the West looked so foolish and frustrated as did the foreign ministers gathered in Geneva last week to settle the fate of backward little Laos . <P> <P> On the big day the 14-nation* conference was supposed to get going , the man who proposed it , Cambodia 's Prince Norodom Sihanouk , had not shown up ( but agreed , after some pleading , to come later ) . As for the Laotians , the Communist side sent two delegations-one headed by a veteran guerrilla representing the Pathet Lao , the other by a onetime Vientiane bookseller who was standing in for self-styled " neutralist ' ' Prince Souvanna Phouma . The royal government delegation straggled in two days late . <P> Three Sides ? The U.S. and its allies at first refused to sit down until the ceasefire back in Laos had been verified . When the verification came ( despite scattered shooting ) , the U.S. still held back on the ground that only one delegation from each side in Laos was entitled to a formal seat . The Communists brazenly argued that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The U.S. came to Geneva determined to press for a " truly neutral and independent Laos " and some sort of watchdog commission to prevent any outside interference . As the conference began , there was n't a ghost of a chance of getting anything like that . Some cynics suggested that the best thing the Kennedy Administration could hope for was a protracted , tedious session that would disguise with boredom what was happening to Laos . Secretary of State Dean Rusk plans to turn the whole chore over to Roving Ambassador Averell Harriman as soon as possible and head for home . <P> <P> Planeload . The Communists would be happy to stick around . Happiest of all were the Red Chinese , who were gleeful to find themselves back at a bargaining table-and propaganda forum-with the civilized world . The chosen delegate was chunky , Paris-educated Marshal Chen Yi , 60 , who has been Foreign Minister for three years and who , as a veteran of the 1927 Nanchang uprising and commander of the rearguard in Mao Tse-tung 's Long March in 1934 , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko was at hand at the airport as Chen 's Tu-104 jet touched down . While Chen was posing at one ramp with Gromyko , so many grey-clad figures scampered out of the rear of the plane and off the field that not even the Swiss got a head count . The total Chinese delegation was thought to top 200 . Chen Yi took up residence in a secluded villa , and the rest of his troupe settled down in the shabby Hotel Metropole , whose only apparent advantage is its isolation . <P> <P> Gromyko talked last week about " Austria-type " neutrality for Laos , a phrase that does not make much sense when applied to so primitive a land , but sounds soothing to the British and French . The Chinese are blunter . Marshal Chen demanded " a unified , independent " Laos and did not mention neutrality at all . Obviously , Chen was delighted to hang around indefinitely , flaunting China 's power in an area where the West was in disarray . One possible clue was in the length of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Expiration date : November . <P>
