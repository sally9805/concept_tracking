A couple of weeks ago , Administration insiders leaked the news that Fowler Hamilton , an international lawyer and an old Government hand , would soon be appointed director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency , succeeding Allen Dulles . Later , the word came that Wall Street Banker George Woods would soon be named head of the new Agency for International Development . But under the New Frontier , such predictions are often unsafe until the actual swearing-in ceremonies . When President Kennedy last week announced the appointment of Fowler Hamilton , it was not to the CIA but to the AID job . <P> In fact , the President had seriously considered Hamilton for CIA . But Kennedy wanted a long-term intelligence chief , and Hamilton , a man of many affairs , was reluctant to make a career out of CIA . Similarly , Woods was a genuine candidate for AID . But as chairman of the First Boston Corp. , one of the nation 's largest investment banking firms , he was anathema to several liberal Democratic Senators : it was First Boston that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1954 . When those Senators threatened to fight Woods 's nomination , his name was dropped and Hamilton 's substituted . <P> Wise &; Long-Range . In his new job , Hamilton will inherit an agency with a lineage going back 20 years to the old Lend-Lease Administration . In its newest form , AID will replace the International Cooperation Administration and the Development Loan Fund , with responsibility for most foreign-aid functions . Hamilton will have close to $4 billion to distribute among needy nations-and the special assignments of persuading them to spend their dollars wisely , on long-range programs of economic development . <P> A native of Kansas City , Mo. , Fowler Hamilton , 50 , got his law degree as a Rhodes scholar , at Oxford 's Christ Church College-where he developed a taste , which he still indulges , for Savile Row suits and old port .

During World War II , he helped select German economic targets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Economic Warfare Division of the U.S. embassy in London . <P> Fluent Heavyweight . After the war , Hamilton became chief legal consultant of the Justice Department , later returned to private practice ( mainly international law ) in Manhattan , where he now lives . A confirmed Democrat who gets along well with Republicans , he backed Stu Symington for President , helped write a report on the Defense Department for John Kennedy immediately after the election . <P> An inveterate globetrotter , Hamilton has firsthand knowledge of many of the countries he will deal with . He is a dark-browed heavyweight ( 195 lbs. ) , an aggressive administrator and a fluent conversationalist who is brusquely intolerant of small talk . " I think I have a very good understanding of foreign problems , " he says , " and I welcome this opportunity . "
