The bustling pace of 20th century business often slows to a pleasant walk in Idaho . In the state 's sylvan surroundings , many businessmen duck-hunt before work , water-ski after work , and fret less about growth charts than about the potato crop . It seems an unlikely setting for a modern , aggressive company . But that is just what Idaho has in the Boise Cascade Corp. , which has grown in only six years into a major enterprise and a magnet for Eastern-trained executives . <P> Born from the merger of three sleepy sawmill companies , Boise Cascade is now a diversified producer of paper , lumber and building materials , with mills , factories and retail stores in eight Western states . Its sales ( $175 million in 1962 ) will rise above $200 million this year , despite intense competition , erratic prices and the overcapacity of the U.S. lumber industry . Last week , having completed negotiations , it was hoping for the Federal Trade Commission 's approval to buy Crown Zellerbach 's St. Helena Pulp &; Paper Co. in Oregon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has taken over operation of a Guatemala paper mill in its first move abroad . In a deliberate reach eastward , it recently bought a Chicago envelope company and opened a new container plant in Kansas City . <P> Up from Sawdust . Behind Boise Cascade 's swift success is its president , Robert V. Hansberger , 43 , a balding , farm-born graduate of the University of Minnesota and Harvard Business School ( ' 47 ) . Hansberger , who looks a little like Yul Brynner , was summoned to rescue struggling Boise Cascade in 1957 on the strength of his success in setting up and profitably running his own small paper mill in Oregon . With sales of $53 million , Boise Cascade was then too small to build a pulp plant to utilize the waste wood chips and sawdust that it was simply burning up . Hansberger merged with two competitors in similar straits , thus gaining the size and stature to borrow $20 million to build a pulp mill and two box plants close to the Northwest apple , pea and potato growers who were ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merging selectively , by persuading bankers to lend him huge sums ( " We 've just never been turned down when we wanted to borrow , " he says ) , and , most importantly , by luring a small army of dedicated business school graduates to Idaho . Fourteen Harvard men have followed Hansberger westward , including five this year ; one recent recruit is Charles Tillinghast III , son of the president of Trans World Airlines . Working hard , the young men have revitalized the company with selling flair and bright ideas , have cracked their way into markets once considered unattainable . <P> Turndown . A calm and casual executive , Hansberger invests half his time in flying visits to company offices , spends Saturday mornings with his staff in the main office " to do all the weighty philosophizing that you can get done when the phone is n't ringing . " Along with other company executives , he dabbles in Idaho Republicanism , puts himself " somewhere between Goldwater and Rockefeller , but probably on the liberal side . " He turned down an offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company was n't quite mature enough to leave alone then . " Idahoans suspect that his high ambitions will in time tempt him out onto the stump .
