When Kansas-born Eugene C. Pulliam in 1948 added the Indianapolis News to his string of newspapers , * the News lacked an editor . Pulliam did not mind . He sets overall editorial policy anyway-on a bearing somewhat to the right of Warren Gamaliel Harding . Last week , after twelve years , the editor 's chair at the News finally had a tenant . " I 've been looking for years to find a man like him . " chortled Gene Pulliam , 71 . " I 've combed the whole goddam country . There are lots of good journalists around , but they 're all cockeyed left-wingers . " <P> " Unequivocally Conservative . " By no stretch of the imagination can M. Stanton Evans , the News 's new editor , be called a cockeyed left-winger . But he may well be the youngest metropolitan-daily editor in the U.S. He is 26 , an age at which many journalists are still writing obits or patrolling the police beat . Editor Evans has never written an obituary or chased an ambulance . Gifted and earnest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Phi Beta Kappa , magna cum laude ) . In college he fell in with a group of students that called itself " The Inter-Collegiate Society of Individualists . " In this company Evans studied the record of the late Senator Joseph McCarthy , decided that McCarthy " was in the main correct . " <P> By the time he had read Sidney Hook , James Burnham and Edmund Burke , he had decided that " to be a conservative today , you have to be a radical . " This conclusion led to a $350-a-month assistant editorship on the Freeman magazine and another job with another right-wing magazine , the National Review , put out by his wealthy Yale friend , William ( God and Man at Yale ) Buckley . " The American tradition , " Evans proclaimed in the Review , " is unequivocally conservative . " Evans still serves the National Review as a contributing editor . <P> Inevitably Eugene Pulliam got wind of Evans , and in 1959 invited him out to Indianapolis to be chief editorial writer for the News . It was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Wisdom . As an editor younger than most of his staff-among them Gene Pulliam 's son Eugene S. , who is 46 and managing editor-Evans plans not to interfere with the news operations . The only change he has ordered so far is to dress up the editorial page with pictures , including a half-column cut of himself . Still a zealous disciple of conservatism , he spends hours poring through its literature in his third-floor walkup apartment just around the corner from the News . He attends Roberts Park Methodist Church , devotes his evenings to political ward meetings , public rallies , municipal debates . <P> At 26 he is as convinced as is Gene Pulliam at 71 that he is on the right track , journalistically as well as otherwise . " I think my philosophy is pretty close to the farmer in Seymour , Ind. , " he says . " He believes in God . He believes in the U.S. He believes in himself . This intuitive position is much closer to wisdom than the tortured theorems of some of our Harvard dons .
