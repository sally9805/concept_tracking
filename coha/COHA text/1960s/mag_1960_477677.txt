WHEN I visited the Arthur Millers in Hollywood early this year , I did not find them living in a luxurious twenty-bedroom villa . with a heart-shaped swimming pool , but in a two-room , first-floor apartment in one of the small bungalows hidden behind palm trees in the garden of the quiet and elegant Beverly Hills Hotel . The spacious living-room with its oversized cold fireplace was comfortable but it nevertheless felt impersonal . This was clearly a temporary camping ground for the Millers . Arthur Miller was very much as I expected him to be , except for his startling height . Marilyn Monroe was utterly different . Arthur Miller was as informal as his open polo shirt , and as powerfully intellectual as his high forehead , his penetrating eyes , and his sharp chin make one suspect . His nonchalance , however , is deceptive . In debate a fierce intensity and a nervous restlessness come to the surface , and then very suddenly his dark-brown eyes begin to flash . When he looks at his wife , however , they seem sereneand content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is not the type of American who calls a stranger by his first name . Marilyn Monroe did not have the flamboyance or dignity of a diva , nor did she make the room electric with sex . This was just a beguilingly pretty girl who looked at me rather shyly and coquettishly ? not a seductive , man-consuming vamp but a little kitten one felt like stroking . We settled around the empty fireplace , Arthur Miller lounging comfortably at the end of the long sofa while Marilyn Monroe stretched out over the rest of it with her head , slightly tilted , against his shoulder . Inevitably the discussion began with the American approach to sex , the meaning of Mrs. Miller 's femininity as a national and international symbol , and moved onto the use of sex in films and in the theatre . It was here that her husband took over : MILLER : Certainly in this postwar period the serious American theatre has become more and more bizarre in terms of preoccupation with odd sexuality , on the one hand , and with being very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can write passionately about sex and not have to jar the audience with disturbing questions . But 64 THE STATE OF THE THEATRE it has one great virtue : I think we use on our stage ? snore than other countries do , possibly ? any kind of person . For instance , until very recently the British theatre would not take seriously a play unless it had elegant personages in one form or another on the stage . I know when I was in England with " View from the Bridge , " it was hard to find people who would play ? or could play ? working-class people . There were plenty of actors who had come from lower-middle-class families , but they had trained themselves out of being that kind of person any more . Ours is a democratic theatre at least in that respect , and I think that 's part of its strength all over the world . BRANDON : What stimulates you into writing a play ? MILLER : If I knew , I could probably control the inception of it better . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , I can not write anything that I understand too well . If I know what something means to me , if I have already come to the end of it as an experience , I ca n't write it because it seems like a twice-told tale . I have to astonish myself , and that 's of course a very costly way of going about things , because you can go up a dead end and discover that it 's beyond your capacity to discover some organism underneath your feeling . and you 're left simply with a formless feeling which is not itself art . It 's inexpressible and one must leave it until it is hardened and becomes something that has form and has some possibility of being communicated . It might take a year or two or three or four to emerge . BRANDON : So you really do n't know how your play is going to end when you start it . MILLER : I do n't , I have a rough notion . for instance , if a play has a hero in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must know the core of irony involved . But little else in terms of the progression of the story . The shape and , so to speak , the tempo of the development , are created within the play itself . BRANDON : When you , for instance , wrote your new film script , " The Misfits , " did you write it with your wife in mind for a part in it ? MILLER : I was of two minds about that , because I happen to believe that she can do anything on the screen . But it 's impossible for me to write for a person , inasmuch as my vision is concentrated on something quite different , on some evolving paradox . The question of an actress , an actor , is the furthest thing from my mind at that time . Only toward the end of The Misfits " did I become thankfully aware that this would be wonderful for Marilyn . A play is made by sensing how the forces in life simulate ignorance ? you set free the concealed irony , the deadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tortuous birth , is n't it ? MILLER : I can write very quickly , but that 's simply the last stage of the process . By that time , I have found the walls of life and I can feel them , and I can fill that room now and I can proceed . It 's when there is no inner evolution that I am lost . BRANDON : Do you think that American drama has been an authentic expression of life in this country ? HUNGER FOR PURPOSE MILLER : It depends on the level on which you 're thinking of American life . Any people has a conventional idea of what they 're like . Americans fancy themselves , for instance , to be openhanded , on the side of justice , a little bit careless about what they buy , wasteful , but essentially good guys , optimistic . But under that level of awareness there is another one , which gets expressed in very few movies and very few plays , but in more plays in proportion than in the movies : the level which confronts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose . BRANDON : Some critics think that the Angry Young Men in England were influenced by American writing on that deeper level . MILLER : I think that there is an American note in their writing . I do n't mean that a play like John Osborne 's " Look Back in Anger " could not have been done without the American influence , but there 's a certain straightforward , even brash , thrust to these works which in tone is very American , and which to my mind does not typify modern English letters ? which are much more oblique and remote . I found myself very much at home with the writing . Osborne 's attitudes were always those of the plain fellow kicking through the conventional class lines in all directions ? something that has become commonplace in this country since even Mark Twain . The American play is pre-eminently active , Henry Brandon 's interview with the Arthur Millers will be one of seventeen conversation pieces to be published by Doubleday in January , titled " As We Are . " Mr. Brandon has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of London for the past eleven years . BY ARTHUR MILLER AND HENRY BRANDON 65 relatively unreflective as such . It deals with nothing it can not act out . It rarely comments on itself ; like the people , it always pretends it does not know what it is doing . It must be something rather than be about something . But when a play does both at once it is most highly prized . It is a hard school to go to , but in my opinion the best one at the present time . BRANDON : Do you see anything as " indigenous " in the American theatre as is the Westerner in films ? MILLER : Literally speaking , the Westerner as he appears in Westerns is the last " indigenous " person in the United States today . The number of people involved , let 's say , in cattle raising , in being cowboys , is very small . The number of people in the West , however , who are involved in trade and industry is much greater . What the Westerner in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he does n't typify anything any more except escape and a memory of what people like to believe the past was like . I think the salesman is much more typical of American life , both in viewpoint and numbers . God knows , for every cowboy there are one million salesmen . BRANDON : To switch for a moment to a more modern character : As one who had a brush with McCarthyism , do you think that this phenomenon is now dead in America ? MILLER : As such it is . Two things happened : one was that the Army defeated him , not ? I 'm sad to say ? liberals or the Left ? not the people who knew what he was about . It was another conservative authority that knocked him clown . 1 do n't think one can push an attack on the integrity of the United States government itself to the lengths that he did and get away with it . However , the legacy of McCarthy is still with us . But it does n't have the mass backing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . BRANDON : You mean he was defeated for the wrong reasons . MILLER : Yes . He gained the antagonism of people who essentially did n't disagree with him very much ? not all of them , but a good many of them . My own opinion is that he may have been demented toward the end ; he misjudged his position and his power . BRANDON : Well , do you mean to imply , then , that you think it could recur ? MILLER : If an international crisis sufficiently intense gripped us , I think something like it could happen again , yes . BRANDON : Still he stands basically in most American eyes exposed as a bad influence . MILLER : He does , but what he did does n't . Guilt-by-association , for instance ? I would say quite as many people believe that as believed it before . I do n't think they 'd recognize it as McCarthyism if it were presented in another form . When you do n't defeat somebody on the basis of principle , he is only personally defeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not long ago I discussed with Peter Ustinov a complaint of yours that American playwrights write important social plays , but that they fail to grasp the total social problem . Peter felt that there was a lack of sensitivity involved in what you said , that you could say the same thing about Chekhov ? that he was only dealing with a cross section of weary landlords on the point of bankruptcy , but as soon as the revolution broke out these things were accepted RS very valid criticism . After all , Peter said , the writer 's job is to stimulate ? to ask questions , not to provide solutions . MILLER : Ustinov is wrong about Chekhov and he is wrong about me . I have never been able to understand why une is insensitive because one looks beyond the individual to society for certain causations and certain hopes . It seems quite the reverse to me . I never had the illusion that Chekhov was only writing about some weary landlords . Bolsheviks , indeed , accused him of this , and defensive conservatives hoped it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known now merely as a genre painter , a curio . It is an almost international mistake , even now , to see him as a writer satisfied to reveal Iifc 's absurdities , even as a celebrant of futility . But , in fact , Chekhov was tortured by his inability to settle on solutions ? he accused himself of deceiving his public because he could not tell them what they must do . The plays are great , for one thing , not because they do not give answers but because they strive so mightily to discover them , and in the process draw into view a world that is historical . It is not right to confuse Chekhov 's modesty with his accomplishment . In " The Cherry Orchard " when the real-estate developer destroys with his axe the lovely but unproductive basis of the characters ' lives , Chekhov was not merely describing a picturesque piquancy , but the crude thrust of materialism taking command of an age . His plays are full of speeches about having to go to work and somehow to become part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much-loved people and 66 THE STATE OF THE THEATRE the forces displacing them . A playwright provides answers by the questions he chooses to ask , by the exact conflicts in which he places his people . Chekhov wrote : " A conscious life without a definite philosophy is no life , rather a burden and nightmare . " A writer who has not spent his life trying to find and articulate " answers " could not have written this . I am not calling for more ideology , as Ustinov implies . I am simply asking for a theatre in which an adult who wants to live can find plays that will heighten his awareness of what living in our time involves . I am tired of a theatre of sensation , that 's all . I am tired of seeing man as merely a bundle of nerves . That way lies pathology , and we have pretty well arrived . BRANDON : Talking about ideology , how does the religious drama of Graham Greene impress you ? MILLER : I must confess that as a dramatist I find his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it seems to end in a bald assertion . He 's caught between two needs . On the one hand , he has to keep his works on a lay level , because that 's his style as well as the level on which life is lived in this age . On the other hand , he has to broach a spiritual solution . which has no embodiment in the course of the play . God escapes realism . I find them to be good plays until they have approached the point where what is most important to him enters into them ? the leap to another form of consciousness . I do n't see how that leap is possible within his realistic form . To make it you would have to create an inspired world from the beginning ; 1 could believe in that . I do n't think I could explain it , but I could believe in it . I admire the quality of his conviction , even of his dilemma , but he has forced it into a geometry at the end . I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world because Greene is presenting his vision as , so to speak , a daylight vision . BRANDON : The American theatre has no religious content ; do you have an explanation ? MILLER : There 's one possible clue in this schizophrenia of the American mind in that respect . We 're probably the most churchgoing nation in history . But there is a sharp line drawn between going to church and thinking that way . In daily economic life , there is no more materialistic or efficient population . However , on Sunday it 's quite the other way . Life is lived , so to speak , without reference to a religious ideology , excepting the weekly nodding toward the sky . Now I suppose our theatre naturally reflects this . I think the big change for the American theatre came when it was no longer possible to contain the increasingly absurd contradictions of existence within the formula of a play which simply presented a more or less evil influence , and a more or less good influence , and batted it out between them . The evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were left with , I think , a hero whose enemies were invisible : the victim as victim came to the fore . The story of almost every important American play is how the main character got his corners knocked off . So , I would say , our main tradition from O'Neill to the present , revolves around the question of integrity ? not moral integrity alone , but the integrity of the personality . The difficulty is to locate the forces of disintegration . I have to believe they exist and can be unveiled . I wrote " The Crucible " in this frame of mind . It happened that it was written at the time of McCarthyism so that a kind of personification of disintegration existed among us again . But it was an attempt to create the old ethical and , dramaturgic order again , to say that one could n't passively sit back and watch his world being destroyed under him , even if he did share the general guilt . in effect , 1 was calling for an act of will . I was trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our world is so in part because we have feared through guilt to unmask its ethical outlines . The plays of the ' forties , which began as an attempt to analyze the self in the world , are ending as a device to exclude the world . Thus self-pity and sentimentality rush in , and sexual sensationalism . It is an anti-dramatic drama , and it reflects the viewpoint of a great many people who seem to feel that 's the way life is today . To me it 's a challenge to define what is creating these effects among us . MINCE PIE AND GAUZE BRANDON : American drama is really still very young . How do you see its evolution ? MILLER : We had a very slight indigenous American drama until the first world war . By that I mean a direct reflection of American manners , American life , barely existed on the stage . The plays were melodramas , for the most part , with a very few exceptions . It 's after the first world war that real attempts were made to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the moment . And I think O'Neill has to be set aside from the main stream because his preoccupation was not so much with the journalistic reportage of what was going on ? which is , I think , true of most of the other writers in the ' twenties and ' thirties ? but with the quest for the relationship between an individual , and for want of a better word , fate . At bottom their world was rational , his a mystery . BRANDON : Which writers are you thinking of ? MILLER : Well , you take plays like Anderson and Stallings ' " What Price Glory " and Hecht and MacArthur 's " The Front Page , " which were great influences , I think , and Elmer Rice 's " Street Scene . " For the first time , for instance , profanity was used in the way that it 's used commonly in the United States . The old hokum of sentimental idealism was destroyed . The war was viewed without the usual ballyhoo of past plays , which made a glorification of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . A new , brash iconoclasm entered , the contemporaneous cynicism and the gaiety . I think a great influence was probably David Belasco , who was a naturalist , what we would think of as corny because his plots were frightful . There were scenes in his plays such as the one where the hero is about to be executed and the heroine runs onto the stage with the American flag and throws it over him ? and the United PHILIP LEVINE THE LOSERS MIDNIGHT brings the midnight news . I , who 've lost at solitaire More patience than I care to lose , Quiet when the waves declare The public and improbable Morality of sweet despair . Nations rise , princes fall ; The names are those we 've heard before . Someone else , unmentioned , small , Cries behind an inner door . Blackjack smiles his knowing smile : He will win this classic war , Famously in famous style He will bring us to the dirt , ? The little ones who all the while Stiffen with our mortal hurt . States Army could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the making of the productions he was enormously inventive in naturalistic terms . He created volcanoes on the stage ? and Child 's Restaurant down to the flies on the mince pie . Stanislaysky saw his work and thought Belasco was a very great director . He seized on a tool which the American theatre is still using and to much better effect ? the naturalistic actor . What was added subsequently was the story whose proportions were closer to the reality as the audience knew it . Robert Sherwood , Maxwell Anderson , S. N. Behrman , Philip Barry , Elmer Rice , George Kelly , Sidney Howard ? all began or had their roots in the ' thirties . They brought it of age . BRANDON : How does their work strike you now ? MILLER : Today a lot of their work seems mild , a bit too play-conscious and even innocent , despite their efforts to break with the older tradition of pose and stage sham . Some of their work is very fine ? the workmanship is good , perhaps too good for our current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps because we share his neuroticism . O'Neill spoke like a minority man , like us ; the others were more public speakers . We prize the subjective now ; they prized craft , wit , comment on manners , iconoclasm . Somc of the best work of these men was done in the ' thirties , but that epoch was characterized for many people by the minority voices , mainly Clifford Odets and Lillian Hellman . The social playwrights were still trying to be craftsmen , still spoke publicly , but in Odets and Hellman the inner voice broke through in that they personally felt the public anguish of the Fascist years . In Odets a new lyricism ; a prose larger than life . In Hellman a remorseless rising line of action in beautifully articulated plays . Both these writers expressed personality ? their works identified them . But the symbols were often so tuned to the particulars of the ' thirties that when that brief cataclysm passed into wartime , their world seemed out of date . It remains to be seen whether this is really so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was deeply moved by these plays and remember them with love . One ought to remember that it was by no means only the " Left " writers who wrote social plays . Maxwell Anderson , Sherwood , Rice , Sidney Howard , even Behrman and Barry were involved with the themes of social and economic disaster , Communism and Fascism . But Odets and Hellman made these themes personal to themselves . They matured with the depression ; the others before . BRANDON : And what followed then ? MILLER : Since the ' forties , the line of development has been toward more and more intimacy of statement by playwrights and less attention to the older idea of craft , of stage logic . In this sense O'Neill remains the leader . His work is just as full of ill-digested Freudianism as the others , just as absorbed with questions like Socialism , the Negro problem , social justice , etc. , and as weighted down as any other with out-of-date slang and mawkish devices and melodrama . But he could not for long be drowned in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to many of its tones . His self-pity , his tortured questing , his relentless doubts , overwhelm his often stagy solutions ; the other writers too often were sealed up in their plays . The ' fifties became an era of gauze . Tennessee Williams is responsible for this in the main . One of my own feet stands in this stream . It is a cruel , romantic neuroticism , a translation of current life into the war within the self . All conflict tends to be transformed into sexual conflict . The sets have therefore become less and less defined in realistic terms , for the society is more and more implied , or altogether blotted out . Its virtue is its ability to intensify the sensual ? using that word to mean the senses , feeling . It has all moved now to a dangerous extreme of triviality . It is a theatre with the blues . The genuine original cry has become a rehearsed scream of a self-conscious whimper . The drama will have to find its way back into the daylight world without losing its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a ceiling again . The drama will have to re-address itself to the world beyond the skin , to fate . THE BARBER 'S HERO BRANDON : Did you see Samuel Beckett 's " Waiting for Godot " ? MILLER : I 've read it . I never got to see it . I admire that play for the rebellion in it . It is an intimate statement ? a very hard thing to do on the stage , and at the same time an abstract of the time . It has feeling and it has a brain . I find it necessary , however , to ask what are its limits ? its viability for the future . It enforces upon us a sense of the desolate ? which is just what it is designed to do . But I do not think it flexible enough to embrace other moods , so to speak . A criticism of it would be that it is addressed , I think , exclusively to its own cultural level . That is legitimate and proper . But , for myself anyway , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the street corner . BRANDON : I think that you and Sartre are the two most powerful dramatists today . The difference between you and him , it seems to me , is that his writings are dominated by ideas . . . MILLER : There is a great difference between us . For one . I 'm writing in a culture that does not truck with ideas ; it resists knowing what it is doing . This goes for an ordinary individual and a gigantic corporation . In France ? to a much greater degree ? the people are aware that if they do n't know what they 're doing , it is possible to characterize it objectively anyway ; that is , they will concede that somebody knows what they 're doing , and that this is a legitimate kind of work , so to speak . Here , this sort of approach is a luxury , which a few cloistered people may indulge in , but it 's of no consequence . What the hell is the difference if you do know ? We believe in necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary , here in America , is mistaken for the right . But sometimes men must . interfere with the inevitable . BRANDON : Is this partly due to a certain anti-intellectualism ? MILLER : I would like to make clear BY ARTHUR MILLER AND HENRY BRANDON 69 pride and accomplishment . " D'Annunzio " made the barber feel more valuable . BRANDON : You had become an intellectual in the eves of your barber because you knew D'Annunzio . MILLER : Writers here have no such connotation for the masses as D'Annunzio had for the Italians . Nor would any writer regard himself ? as Russian writers have and many French ? as spokesman for the national spirit or something of the kind . Ill a word , we have no status excepting that we are makers of entertainment , or heavy thinkers , or earners of big money . In the profoundest sense , of course , this is an anti-intellectual attitude , but it is neither hateful nor contemptuous for the most part . The truth is that no other occupation is regarded symbolically as a national adornment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the soldier in wartime . Nor do we have a consciousness of an " American Culture " in the way the French have , and other European nations . But it does not mean we do not value our plays , movies , paintings , music . It i5 simply that they are enjoyed without being called manifestations of the national spirit . This has both good and bad consequences . Most obviously , it makes the country appear from outside like a nest of peddlers . Denial of public recognition makes some intellectuals take on an unnatural defensiveness toward themselves , an inferior feeling which breeds isolation and hopelessness and weakness . Perhaps the worst effect is that when , as during the McCarthy period , it is necessary for basic principles of human existence to be upheld , the natural upholders ? the intellectuals ? are face to face with a population that is unused to listening to their advice . In a word , we are not so much persecuted as ignored . But everybody else is ignored too . doubt there is a single professional class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or recognition . This even includes businessmen who are always revealing a sense of occupational inferiority , and who envy and resent how artists are all the time being publicly acclaimed ! The benefits , if nne may call them that , are not inconsiderable . Art here is irrelevant to life , in the minds of most , so it is free to do what it will with life . BRANDON : Does n't that depress an artist ? MILLER : Yes . The artist is hard put to reassure himself that his occupation is anything but trivial . And this , I think , is the biggest wound the American attitude inflicts . To survive it , an artist has to cling to his dignity with histeeth sometimes , often at the very moment he is being acclaimed , for it is a rare thing to be acclaimed excepting for irrelevant reasons . But will a public cult of intellectualism really result in a higher understanding of art 's relevance to life ? If Europe is an example , I wonder . . . . I have heard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avowals of pro-intellectualism from some of the most corrupt and unphilosophical people . The single important advantage of the attitude , I think , is that it presses the artist the more to overcome it . You have to hit the public when it is not looking , so to speak ; you have to make it real to them the way thc subway is real . You ca n't depend on their embracing your work . because it is art , but only because it somehow reaches into the part of them that is still alive and questing . This kind of challenge can almost destroy a delicate art like poetry , but for the drama and the novel it can muscularize them . It can also make them muscle-bound. and strident , and screaming , and sensational . But all 1 want to make clear at the moment is that the thing is not a dead loss by any means . THE CENTER OF THE WEE BRANDON : Where . do you think , are we moving ? MILLER : One thing the theatre will not stand for too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boredom . The blue play is now becoming predictable in mood . We expect a pathetic defeat in the play and the documentation of alienated loneliness . I think they 're quite suddenly going to become old hat . Perhaps it is only my feeling ; but I think life is now perhaps less impossible than it was , say , even two years ago . And this is as much a political and social fact as it is a theatrical fact . I mean to say that the possibility of the survival of the human race now appears to be a reasonable hope for a person to take hold of . Certain steps have been taken that would indicate that a rapprochement of some sort can be made between two civilizations . The theatre as yet has not got the reach , the breadth of vision to see much more than the center of the web in which we struggle . But I think there are indications that we may have a right to state once again that all is not lost . And as soon as that really happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it will not long seem the way things are ; and the style itself will seem willful and self-conscious .
