When John Kennedy named Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr . to be Under Secretary of Commerce early in March 1963 , he had every intention of boosting him eventually into the No. 1 spot at Commerce , then held by Luther Hodges . To give Roosevelt some show case exposure before the promotion , Kennedy sent him into Appalachia with orders to find a prescription for poverty there . But a year later , when Roosevelt submitted his 93-page report . Lyndon Johnson was in the White House . <P> Lyndon praised Roosevelt 's Appalachia work , used it as a base for much of his own anti-poverty program . But the President did not consider " Frank " to be of Cabinet caliber , and last January Johnson selected Drug Executive John T. Connor to replace the retiring Hodges . Said Roosevelt : " I was disappointed in not being picked , but who would n't be ? I 'm objective enough to know that a businessman should fill that office . " Connor and Roosevelt got along all right , but the Secretary wanted to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit restless too . <P> Out of Space . Finally last week the President solved it for everyone . He named Frank Roosevelt , 50 , to a two-year term as the first chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , an agency created under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act . The board begins its official function on July 2 , investigating specific complaints of job discrimination on the basis of race , religion , national origin or sex among labor unions or employers with 25 or more workers . Beyond " informal methods of conference , conciliation and persuasion , " the commission can not do much about intransigent violators except to wait for already overworked Civil Rights Division lawyers in the Justice Department to bring suits . <P> The commission 's job was not made any easier by the fact that Johnson waited so long to make his appointment . Said Roosevelt himself : " We do n't have any space , any staff , any budget for 1966 , any guidelines . " Beyond that , Roosevelt does not even know any of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On paper , Roosevelt 's new job would seem to be a first-rate launching platform for what he really wants to do : run next year against Nelson Rockefeller for Governor of New York . " I would be less than frank , " said Frank last week , " if I did n't say that I was interested in the governorship . I would be flattered if the party wanted me or drafted me . " But the civil rights and minority group votes do not come automatically-not even to a Roosevelt , as Brother Jimmy discovered last month when he was soundly trounced in the Los Angeles mayoralty election . And several civil rights spokesmen were less than enthusiastic about Frank Roosevelt 's appointment . Said Donald Slaiman , director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. ' s civil rights department : " We were not only cool to Roosevelt 's selection , but chilled . He just does n't have any civil rights experience . " Said Clarence Mitchell , a director of the N.A.A.C.P. : " I did n't exactly think of it as a good choice . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
