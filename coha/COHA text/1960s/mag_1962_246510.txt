Murmuring scholarly pleasantries , a pride of art professors and museum officials gathered amidst the grainy oak paneling and ostentatiously plain furniture of Manhattan 's Harvard Club , only to find the place set with traps . For cocktail-hour amusement before a dinner of the Friends of Harvard 's Fogg Museum , the Fogg 's director , tweedy John P. Coolidge of the Boston Coolidges , had arranged a jolly academic jape : the walls were hung with forged art-or was it all forged ? <P> One of the first items in the quiz was a Crivelli Pieta , and the trick was to tell what part was original and what part had been restored . Except for certain slick parts , most of the crackled surface seemed beyond reproach . It might even have fooled the Fogg , had the man who donated the painting not also given two photographs of it . one taken in 1907 and the other in 1909 . The earlier photograph showed that before restoration about half of Christ 's body had peeled off . <P> The test went on to two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carracci and one an excellent copy by a contemporary . But the most fiendish items were three drawings of a Mother and Child , all apparently Picassos . <P> The Foggmen had taken extraordinary pains with these . To produce the two forgeries , they made a printed facsimile of the original . They then went over the reproductions with charcoal , smudging a bit here , rubbing a bit there . They went over the signatures in pencil , even reproduced two tiny fungus growths that appeared in the original . As a final touch , they placed one of the forgeries in the handsome frame and mat belonging to the original . <P> Even the secretary of the Fogg flunked this question-not to mention the chairman of Princeton 's art department . Other guests scored themselves on sheets of paper , compared their verdicts with the officially announced facts , and quietly crumpled their papers . One expert was too cagey to take the test at all . " I could say . " said James Rorimer , director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art , " that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ icily he added : " People should n't come in to a dinner party and give offhand opinions about what 's genuine and what 's fake . They do n't in the medical profession . "
