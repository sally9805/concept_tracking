The skies glowed red again last week over the nation 's steel cities as the bothered and beleaguered steel industry hummed with the greatest activity in many months . <P> In the steadiest gain in a year and a half , the mills melted well over 2,000,000 tons a week , raising the industry 's operating rate to 70.1% of capacity . Production is up 68% from last July , and new orders are running at their heaviest rate in more than a year . To meet the new demand , Youngstown Sheet &; Tube relit three ironmaking blast furnaces and nine steelmaking open hearths . Chicago 's Inland Steel recalled 1,500 workers from long layoffs . Outside Pittsburgh , U.S. Steel reopened its obsolescent Edgar Thomson Works , usually one of the last to resume production during a pickup . <P> Immediate Need . To an industry that has been stagnating in its own recession for at least two years , all this should have been cause for noisy celebration . But steelmen have had to pay the piper for premature celebrations before , and caution hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be quite sure how much of the fresh demand was business hedging against the possibility of a strike when labor contracts reopen after April 30 . Government steel analysts feel that this fall steel should be able to avoid another tumble like last year 's , and hope to see steel production rise 3% to about 101 million tons in 1963 . Other economists are not so sure . Says George Cloos , senior economist of the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank : " Strike or no , there will be a drop in steel production in the coming months . " <P> Because they are convinced that neither management nor labor wants-and that Government would not tolerate-a labor stoppage in steel this year , steel customers are actually doing less hedge buying than before last year 's contract talks . Industry sources estimate that hedging accounts for no more than 15% of all orders . Though the thriving automakers are prudently stockpiling heavily , most of the industrywide pickup reflects immediate need . Tin-plate demand is rising as the canning season approaches , and appliance makers need more steel because their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high levels . Builders also need more structural steel because of the rise in capital spending ( see below ) . <P> Small Fear . As a result of the new demand , steel prices , which softened after President Kennedy rebuffed the industry 's try to raise prices last April , have begun to firm . But there is small fear of a price increase ; foreign imports and domestic competition wield as big a club as Kennedy ever did . Cut-price imports rose from 3,100,000 tons in 1961 to 4,100,000 tons in 1962 . Aluminum , concrete , glass , plastics and other substitute materials have taken away another 2,000.000 tons a year of business that steel used to count on . Steelmakers now concede that they were too long indifferent to the competition of other materials , and to fight back are boosting their capital spending 11% this year , most of it for modernization . Jones &; Laughlin recently opened a new mill for " thin tin " plate to compete against the increasingly popular aluminum cans that pull open without punching .
