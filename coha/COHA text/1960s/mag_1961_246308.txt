Archeologists , proud plunderers of time , last week retrieved from the debris of centuries a pair of treasures from ancient Greece : <P> Digging near the cucumber-and tomato-growing village of Vraona on the east coast of Attica , Dr. John Papadimitriou , director of antiquities in Greece 's Ministry of Education , uncovered 15 wooden vases carved in geometrical designs-the first such find in history . Knowing that fresh air would decompose the wood , which had been preserved in fertile mud since the 8th or 6th century B.C. , the archeologist rushed them 23 miles to Athens for a thorough preservative bath . <P> Starting from Troy in 1932 , Professor . John L. Caskey of the University of Cincinnati has dug his way along the fabled trade routes of the Aegean Sea . Last summer he stopped at the island of Kea , reckoning that its wind-sheltered harbor offered a natural anchorage for ancient mariners . Caskey was right . This summer , on Kea 's St. Irene peninsula , he found a Mycenean settlement dating back 3,500 years , complete with temple , palace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sewer system . Scattered through the town were fragments of delicate Cretan pottery . The settlement was probably destroyed by an earthquake in 1400 B.C. , but not before the imported arts and crafts of Cretan voyagers had influenced the more primitive local population . " What we call the miracle of Greek civilization , " said Caskey , " did not come out of nothing . "
