Only a few months ago , hardly any one much cared how Charles Quitman Stephens , 57 , chose to lead his life . An unemployed bulldozer operator , Stephens drew a veteran 's modest pension from the Government , lived alone in a room rented for $10 a week in downtown Memphis , and had a reputation for drinking . Stephens would have continued to attract small notice had he not been present in his rooming house on the afternoon that Martin Luther King Jr . was shot to death while standing on a motel balcony a few hundred feet away . <P> According to police , the sniper fired from a window perch in the rooming house . Stephens told authorities that seconds after the shots rang out he had seen a stranger hurrying down the stairs from the second floor , carrying a package that presumably concealed the murder weapon . Days later , he identified the man from photos as James Earl Ray , who was eventually seized in England and charged with King 's murder . <P> Thus , from an inconsequential human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one of the century 's most shocking assassinations . He was so important that the state sought to do everything-even keep him a prisoner-to protect him against harm from possible accomplices in the killing . At first , Stephens willingly moved into Shelby County jail , where he was free to come and go but was accompanied by a bodyguard . He was away too often to suit police . Claiming that his activities outside the jail jeopardized his own safety , the state invoked a Tennessee law that provides for confinement of material witnesses , and imprisoned Stephens in July . In setting bail of $10,000 , the Memphis Criminal Court virtually assured that he would be safely tucked away until Ray 's scheduled trial in November ( see PRESS . ) <P> Stephens was understandably irritated over this treatment , especially when police refused his own brother permission to see him . His irritation raised a little-understood legal issue : What are the rights of a material witness ? He got in touch with a pair of Memphis attorneys , Harvey Gipson , 37 , and Jay Fred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only Tennessee but other states for precedents . While most states permit the jailing of witnesses , the attorneys found , the laws have been applied only in extreme circumstances-when there is clearly no other way to guarantee a witness 's appearance in court . New York courts , for example , have upheld the imprisonment before trial of rackets witnesses who might flee the country or be bribed or intimidated into changing their testimony . <P> No Actual Threats . Tennessee 's law had been tested in the courts only once , but in that case the jailing of a witness had been upheld because he had balked at testifying and had been declared in contempt of court . By contrast , Stephens had been a cooperative witness . His lawyers argued that there was no reason to believe that he would not testify ; there had been no actual threats on his life . Taking the case to a Memphis Circuit Court , Gipson and Friedman won a plea for a writ of habeas corpus on the grounds that Stephens had been denied due process and that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
