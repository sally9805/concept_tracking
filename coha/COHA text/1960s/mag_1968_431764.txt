 | @# LIFE IN THE YELLOW SUBMARINE : BUFFALO 'S SUNY An adventure with one of America 's bright and hopeful new efforts to expand higher education ? the multi-campus state university system ? in which our author makes the discovery that not all fantasy is the work of impractical men . I used to think that Los Angeles ? the place where when you are looking to buy a home you are told you are buying " prime dirt " and the houses are called " structures " ? I used to think that was the American nightmare of the twenty-first century , but things have speeded up , and now New York State is rivaling California . We now have our multi-university system , our State University of New York ( SUNY ) ; and in the midst of the dying elms of the dying town of Buffalo we have our own LA gone wild not far from the choked defunct Erie Canal . I planed into Buffalo last fall , on what amounts to one of those writer-in-residence sort of things , and spent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Buffalo one still hears the Polish of another century . On the east side of town , along East Ferry , are the scars of the summer riots , open American wounds of summers past and summers to come . Poles , Negroes , a thriving Mafia , a Peace Bridge to Canada , the AlbrightKnox Art Gallery , four Frank Lloyd Wright houses , sprawling old Victorian homes with the smell of the East and the shape of the Midwest colliding together ? this is the landscape of Buffalo . There are , to be sure , new suburbs built in classic American monotonous style , and it has its dying Main Street ? with the usual steady stream of garages , Sears Roebuck , and milk-shake stands , and there are , too , the surprising parts of Buffalo , rather beautiful circles , parks , and homes that on a foggy day recall Paris and the Luxembourg Gardens , some of that air of faded comfort that one associates with Proust , and the Avenue Foch . Walking through the west side of the old parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century Buffalo was a prosperous middleclass town ; the ladies of Pittsburgh and Cleveland wrote to Buffalo for their patterns and silks , until , perhaps symbolically , all that seemed to end with a post-Victorian shot in the air . An anarchist rebuffed by Emma Goldman as being " unstable " shot McKinley at the Pan-American Exposition , and because of a doctor 's reluctance to use a new X-ray machine McKinley died of gangrene . Buffalo , too , slowly died of gangrene . The turn-of-thecentury wealthy middle class wished nothing to be changed , and no new industry has come into the town ? though of the belt of dying Northeastern towns Buffalo is a little luckier than most in that it is one of the major seats of the Mafia in the U. S. In the summer of 1967 its citizens were surprised that they , like the rest of America , could have their riots .... Off Main Street with its Sears Roebuck , its garages and highway interstices , its delicatessens and malted delights , is the State University of New York at Buffalo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and into which the state is pouring the usual billions of dollars . At present , it sits on a postage stamp of a campus of old buildings which was six years ago the private University of Buffalo ? a small second-rate university famed primarily for its law school , which , way back in the ' thirties , was the seedbed for better schools . Louis Howe and David Riesman were among those who came out of it . Old pseudo-Gothic , new slabs of Germanic concrete , and pink and blue Army-type quonset huts crammed together is about what Buffalo looks like  | now , a crowded mishmash , while ever Twdn breathlessly waits for the enormous new building which is to serve as " campus , " a presumed architectural glory that will , I gather , cost billions and be the largest single building outside of Brasilia . In the meantime , the student population is expanding at a galloping pace : some are still locals , left over from the days when this was a trolleycar university ; the majority are pouring upstate from greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are part of the experiment known as mass education . Martin Meyerson , formerly of Berkeley , presides over the vast complex and what he has to deal with is nothing less than a microcosm of America Now : new young hippie faculty , expensive " star " faculty , deadwood old faculty , eager students , hippie students , sullen students , an alien , generally hostile town , and a bureaucratic mess . @# Living Off Its Future After one week in the quonset hut known as the English department I felt I was going completely crackers , and then , like Yossarian in Catch 22 , I decided there was nothing else to do but go with it and hope for survival . One result of this decision was that ? someone having noticed that at one point in my life I had clone some film criticism ? in a moment of weakness I found myself being prevailed upon to teach a course on film . Within a week my identity went from writer to film critic to film expert , and everybody , in breathless enthusiasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latest word from Godard , Warhol , etc . One week we are living through the usual tensions and storms over Dow Chemical and the CIA , and when one of the students comes into my office shrieking that he 's had it , is about to blow everything up , I assume he means the CIA . " No , " he cries , " the milk machine ! It 's a thief . Eating my dimes , eating my dimes . " I sympathize . Somehow , I feel , this one has got right smack to the heart of the problem . For Buffalo , a university without a true past , is at present a Blanche du Bois , living off its electronic fantasy future . Its basic timidity and y Barbara Probst Solomon 97 uncertainty about its own image make it lack the courage to be at times conventional , and fearfully and provincially it is desperately grasping at the " new . " Filthy rich , it is buying up scholars and , along with them , supersalesmen who have no idea what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , in line with its futurity , it is of course buying equipment like mad . There is so much money floating around as to create total chaos . Events pile upon pseudo-events in shrieking hysteria . More poetry readings are held , more East Europeans invited , more movies shown on any given day than anyone can absorb . Buffalo , like all provincial towns , vacillates between the poles of thinking that everything is going on elsewhere and that everything is going on in Buffalo . As a result , in order to make up for lacks and simultaneously prove its lack of lacks , there are the poets , the East Europeans , and the movies ? in a greater density per square inch than anything on Morningside Heights . The University suffers constantly from indigestion . The equipment is bought in bulk . Somewhere there is a reactor that either no one can locate or no one knows how to use . In the basement of the classics department is a printing press grinding out ancient Byzantine . Though library facilities are appalling , one is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a new dial-a-matic book system . Daily there are dreams spun to relieve the dreariness of Main Street , Buffalo , and most of the dreams center around the wonders of the Pentagonesque new campus to come : a movie theater that will show films twenty-four hours a day , a complex of seven theaters for a drama school complete with prosceniums to fit each theatrical era , and , as one administrator groaned to me , in sober recognition that the best thing that could possibly happen to Buffalo is to get it to " hold still " for a moment , " Do you realize that when examined closely to scale the theater they have planned is only slightly larger than Lincoln Center ? " At the heart of this is the good old-fashioned American principle that the past does not exist ? and a tendency to put all one 's paper chips into ideas about the future and progress which are irrevocably bound to a notion of happiness and goodness that is our natural national birthright , like manifest destiny . One faculty member breathlessly announced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Statistics are floating around for just about everything . ) " We are producing a race of mental giants . " The children are better , the cam- puses are unique , the future is glorious ; meanwhile the fog in Buffalo is awful , and one professor has just bolted . To Haifa ! I quickly realize that one of my main functions is to read the torrent of messages that are ground out daily by the purple mimeographing machine bought by the English department . There are memos for grants , for feelings , sentiments , sporadic student underground pronunciamentos , and lots of memos about MONEY . For people who live in the future , present time has no meaning . One of the first memos that comes my way is an apology to new faculty suggesting that if one has been in the university for less than four weeks it would be better to wait until spring before applying for summer grants . At the end of the day I am exhausted by the financial opportunities offered to me . Well , I quickly adjust to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if nothing works , it does n't matter , because Buffalo is a child of the future . My second adjustment is to paranoia . I 've always been fond of paranoia as a life style , but paranoia on a grand scale , preferably in some major European capital with good restaurants to plot in . Of course , for paranoia to work , I 've always believed you have to have a lot of spare time ; with the new small teaching loads ( average of two courses a week ) , the placing of sixty-five assorted geniuses , would-be geniuses , poets , writers ( Lionel Abel , Robert Creeley , John Logan , Leslie Fiedler , John Barth among them ) , the scholars looking nervously at writers , writers feeling sullen among all those Ph.D . types , all crammed together in a cinder-block Stalag 17 office , additionally huddled together because the university has no connection with the town of Buffalo ? and even more intensely huddled because the Life of the Mind is being carried on in brutal weather and with an ugliness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelmed by the sheer weight of the paranoia . I figure Tuesdays to read the memos ( statistics : fifty thousand words come through the mimeo every week ? about the size of a nice Francoise Sagan novel ) , and Wednesdays I save for the paranoia . I am greeted in the morning by a young assistant professor , Howard Wolf ; he looks at the corridors with their attempts at McLuhan , posters frantically placed on every wall to cover the cinder blocks , " Veh is mir , " he groans , " the leftist gabardine axis , basement of the mind . " Freud , Jung , Maoism , existentialism , Marcuse , agrarian anarchism , you name it , we have it , Buffalo gray , Klein 's basement of the mind . Buffalo , like all instant universities , in order to @# combat a physical environment that is hell , acquires faculty quickly by offering . high pay and low teaching loads . While it flounders searching for an image of itself on paper , in practice its own style takes form . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them an idea of Western mobility , of Western enthusiasm for new ideas , and a casualness of dress and life style : cramping Westerners into Dostoevskian-cumAmerican physical conditions results in a high degree of nervous tension . There are no crannies here , neither the electric feeling of a large city . nor the trees and buildings of a country campus to absorb any cultural or emotional shocks , to buffer professors ' eccentricities , and here among the cinder blocks , everybody 's emotional problems hit you unprotected . The placing of a jet strip at the Buffalo airport three years ago has also made Buffalo into a suburb of New York City . More and more of the students are coming from Queens , Brooklyn , and the Bronx ; for them , Buffalo , forty-five minutes ' flying time out of La Guardia , is merely an extension of the New York megalopolis . Sitting in the English department one day , I looked down the hall and realized that the jet professor is truly here . I myself live in New York City , my home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over when my husband was a floating academic , distances truly meant nothing either to me or to my children . I often gave my children breakfast in New York in the morning , saw them off to school , spent fortyfive minutes on a jet to Buffalo , taught a few classes , and then came back home to New York not long after they got home from school . In looking down the hall it came to me ( and I 'm not talking about the $100,000-per-year elite , but ordinary associate professors ) that one man commutes between Houston and Buffalo , another is on the New York-London circuit , another is on the TorontoBuffalo-New York circuit , etc . In actual practice I see as many people from Buffalo in New York . at the end of a week , as I see in Buffalo during the week . Obviously the university is coming more and more to resemble the city , with all the problems of the city : it is inchoate , vast , confused , overly mobile , caught in a series of happenings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events " with all the pitfalls of the anonymousness of the city ; one professor found himself deeply shaken when he questioned a student about the problems of draft exile in Canada and realized that the student simply did n't know what he was referring to by way of place , family , home ; the very words appearing to have lost their meaning .  | The new professors are a cross between creditcard intellectuals , businessmen , and performing artists . One visualizes that within five , ten years , professors will be based wherever they choose to live and will essentially be delivering a series of lectures at a series of universities ? which is more or less what is being done now . If the university resembles the city , emotionally it also resembles the Army . Allegiance is not to a specific post ( a given school ) ? one is based at some post and transferred around within the total system ( the university in America ) . The student is also on the move , and the problem of who might be where at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out clearer within the confines of a provincial university , and it is a frightening reality . The least discernible consideration , behind all the new academic window dressing , is the question of who is being taught what , and when . Feeling a little discouraged , and often restless , I would have been glad to do more teaching than I was scheduled for ? idle time in Buffalo is boring ? but I quickly understood that to suggest such a thing would brand me a subversive in the system ; they have graduate assistants for that . I once asked one of the university 's vice presidents if any faculty ever , well , like did they ever discuss actual teaching , and he thought for a minute and said , well no , he could n't remember any time offhand , occasionally students dropped by , but never faculty . At some point ( he was showing me a great many graphs , and like those of every administrator I ever saw on the campus , all his graphs had to do with life ten years hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campus . " Do you mean real bodies or FTEs ? " " I mean students . " I shuddered at the " real bodies , " and I could not avoid imagining them stretched out , ready for a grave somewhere . " What 's an FTE ? " " A full time equivalent , " he rattled off . " You add up a number of credits , which is the equivalent to one real student ? " I shuddered again , told him I had a slow mind . " We have two sets of figures , " he explained , shoving yet another graph in front of my face , " one for real students . " " One for full time equivalents , " I repeated after him , my eyes following the double graphs that look like a series of Mount Everests in combat with one another . I gave up . As I was leaving , the vice president began to question me about , well , what exactly seemed to be going on around the place . There are all types of paranoia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the only thing I remember about my conversations with by Barbara Probst Solomon 99 any of them , which I presume were n't very interesting ? is the conviction that someone " down there , " the reverse of the faculty 's " someone up there , " actually knows what 's going on . That someone probably being a computer . Administrators , I rapidly found , were n't worth talking to , as they seemed primarily to be armed with statistics pulled together for the purpose of implying that a youngster had to give some evidence of genius in his high-school average in order to get in to Buffalo . But once , downstairs in Hays Hall , as I waited for the snow to let up so I could leave . I talked with two students , one of whom said she liked it here but she had worked harder at the University of Miami , it had been a more serious place . Then what , I mentally asked of a graph , has intervened since high school ? Later in New York an architect friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's out at Stony Brook , a fellow university in the state system located in the far reaches of Long Island . He told me , " 1 , Barbara , am designing multi-interdisciplinary units for your full time equivalents . Capiche ? " Buffalo believes in the rebirth of the humanities . " It 's Not the Heating System " I walked across campus with Warren Bennis , the provost of social sciences , a rather thoughtful , reflective man , who had recently come from MIT . He asked me if I had noticed that people tended to behave strangely in Buffalo . " I get the oddest calls , " he mused , " people threatening to leave because the heating system breaks down for a few hours . . . you know damned well it 's not the heating system .... " I muttered that I had observed a rather , shall we say , high degree of hysteria . " I think , " he said , " it is the business about the future . Buffalo has the lure of promise , of possibility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conned ? and all of a sudden they want to act out all their pent-up dreams , all their fantasies , all their ambitions for their own brave new worlds , and , boom , then they are in Buffalo , and unless they are here on a very specific project , boom , the dream explodes , and they find themselves in Buffalo . . . . Some of them will be here for the rest of their lives , trapped by a bit of money , a company town . " He sighed . " It is very sad . " I thought of California , where the idea of this sort of dream began , and how there , at least , when ten , fifteen years ago , the Eastern professor stood in his Eastern suit gazing out at the Pacific Ocean ,  | walking along Malibu Beach , or later La Jolla , or watching the bay at San Francisco 's Golden Gate , if the dream did not become a reality , the landscape gave him room to sustain the illusion just a while longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustaining of things through time , and how now , for the young California professor in his California dungarees , to stand on the edge of Main and Bailey and behold the future is closer to Dick Diver come home from the Riviera . Many afternoons are spent in the Buffalo gray of the English department , with young professors out of Berkeley discussing the look of California , Buffalo outre-mer , Buffalo cajaid . People do behave differently in Buffalo . I sit in my office , wistfully talking to Bruce Jackson about Austin and the pull of the Texas landscape . We have both been there at different times of our lives , and like all children born of the cement and twenty-stories-high of New York City , found that that kind of landscape had a pull . He was showing me his photos of small Texas towns , they had a look I recognized and understood , and he was playing Texas prison songs on the stereo in the office , when someone thrust a lost visiting scholar in at us , whispering , entertain him ? he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , German university in the stacks and papers type , he looked dazed . " I 'm so glad to find you , " he kept muttering . ( Buffalo has a way of inviting people , meaning to be nice , and often losing track of them , so that wouldbe chairmen are just sort of left lost in the halls as some other activity claims the host 's attention . ) We tried to give the man a chair , a cup of coffee , and to reassure him about Buffalo , though , to be sure , it was certainly far from the center of the universe ( when strangers hear that , they often get a certain dazed , disoriented , and frightened look on their face , seeing the parachute they 'd been told to leap out of suddenly fail to open in mid-air , that look of tumbling to earth ) . Finally the professor named his price , what he wanted from Buffalo was a mistress . It was the first time I had seen Bruce Jackson lose his cool . His mouth fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are perhaps not supposed to sit perched on the tops of desks but on chairs alongside of them , he jumped down , turned off the video . I myself stared at the wall on which was affixed a poster of Jean-Paul Belmondo . Definitely this shy Humbert Humbert had been given the word about the " swinging English department at Buffalo , " and was manfully trying to live up to what he thought was expected of him . The poor man seemed to be suffering from some @# sort of temporary cultural shock , and on and on he went , quite seriously explaining his needs ( in Buffalo people spend a great deal of time discussing their emotional states of mind ) . I think what he was describing was actually a housekeeper , but anyway there was no doubt about it , he was standing his ground . Bruce looked at me , I looked at Bruce , Bruce said , " Oh , you can make uh . . . a social life here . " " A mistress . A permanent mistress . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... " " I think I 'd be lonely in Buffalo . " " Graduate students ? Lady faculty ? Townies ? " Bruce gave up . I decide , this one wants a mistress , like hell he wants a mistress . I leaf through my mind , figuring out what is the unmentionable an academic ca n't bring himself to say . " Money ? " I try . The man looks relieved , he blushes slightly . " I 'm glad to find someone , uh , so realistic . I need ... " he looks up at me . " How much ? That is , I do n't mean to sound avaricious , but uh ? " I look at him . " Plenty . " The tone changes , briskly we are talking facts and figures . He names his . Bruce shrugs , " Ask for it , " he says . We settle the money question , now down to the nitty-gritty , his favorite library of course is in some other city . " Possible , " Bruce grunts . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do have a better idea of where I stand . " Abruptly he leaves . I stare out my window , watching the students crossing the campus . Of one thing you can be sure , conversation with academics may start with mistresses , or Klein 's basement of ideas , or academic freedom , but in the end it generally boils down to time and money . Nightmares and Solutions Buffalo 's basic problem is that it is a rapidly growing Goliath of an institution dealing with students who , despite the fancy statistics , arrive at the university as mixed-bag products of the bad American secondary schools from which they spring . Rather than concerning itself with this as a genuine educational problem ? that is , how to give these students a general corpus of knowledge in which they are sadly lacking ? the university has chosen to cover the basic mess with a quick and thick coat of fashionable instant gloss . Most of the professors have too much professional ego at stake to come to terms with type of students they should be educating ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university is via the grad- uate school and the Ph.D. , the undergraduates , who should be the most important part of the process , get the short end of the stick . They are taught by the graduate assistants . Meanwhile there is no adequate advisory system for the students , and no very structured program . The present facilities are intolerable , and the present crop of students , like a generation of guinea pigs , are quite unmistakably being sacrificed to some fantasy of Buffalo 's future greatness . One expects a new university to have problems ; what is disturbing about Buffalo ? and many other state institutions ? is the sense one gets of the fraudulent , of the abrogation of faculty responsibility to the student , which the student in turn reflects in a lack of responsibility toward his own work . Many of the young faculty do n't seem to be in the least aware that the idea of the " new " is oldfashioned American nativism , or that all their talk about " free expression " is in fact a pretty stale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ) , that it was tried and proved a dismal failure , and that true intellectual freedom is hardly identical with chaos . I watched the students one day when a visiting European novelist soberly contradicted a faculty member who referred to his work as " experimental . " He replied that talk of the experimental is always nonsense , that everything he wrote was real , and came out of his experiences with a nightmare world . He told the students that nothing existed except reality , one had no " choice " in the matter , and proceeded to give them a solemn lecture on twentieth-century history . I felt their response , their eagerness and thirst for some sort of genuine encounter with true knowledge , their own fatigue at the word game which made up most of their instruction . Most of all . I felt their ability to perceive the truth when it is being told them . This is something they rarely get from their own faculty , especially those members of it who appear to have spent their own young adult lives on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American universities is one of the most anti-intellectual inventions ever conceived of . Between the Ph.D . requirement and the problem of tenure , the university in America is being reduced to a Bell Telephone psychology . What then about Martin Meyerson , president of this whole complex ? As former acting chancellor of Berkeley he has been burned once . As an urban planner , his dream is for the open campus ? the university related to the town ? a hard feat to accomplish in a sullen city which intensely dislikes the university and whose newspapers often heckle it for the wrong reasons . Perhaps the most sophisticated and intelligent man on the campus and perhaps its most valuable asset ? a shy man who does not come across well in public and is much more at ease in private conversation ? Meyerson is faced with almost insurmountable problems . He is quite aware of the problems he has inherited ? a new faculty , which veers spastically in a thousand directions at once , too many students , and these added to the worst kind of traditional ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The combination is explosive . Then , too , there is Albany . one minute handing the university too much money for the wrong reasons , the next minute cutting the budget . also for the wrong reasons , creating more chaos of another kind as programs started can not be finished : treating the university , in the way of state legislatures , as an angry parent treats a child , now I will be nice to you , now I will punish you . Toward the end of the second term I am beginning to get nightmares about the whole thing . In the middle of one of those graying Buffalo nights . I sit up in bed , dreaming of solutions . The only group I had seen actually make something work on the campus were the Maoists ? at least there was bright-eyed organizational discipline in their teach-in . Everything went off on schedule . Certainly there was good in Buffalo ? the sense at least of life going on in the place , if at times a bit mad . it was better than no life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balloons in a psychedelic tent with strobe lights and music , while nearby the old heated Marxist-Leninist rhetoric of the ' thirties was blanketing the teach-in , and there was something oddly moving and wistful about this American university , this " Buffalo is a Winter Carnival " ambience that one did n't want to see altogether disappear ? and something quite moving in Martin Meyerson 's dream of a free and open campus . Still , something had to be done to make the whole thing work , so that geniuses , poets , students . and faculty could all go about their business in peace . Now the Maoists , they definitely had discipline ? down to the last man , they would make far better administrators than the ones we had now . Meyerson , for a sort of gentle sobriety , a mediator . . . and to give the place a touch of intellectual elegance . But , for someone to do a crash job on the chaos ... McNamara . Two weeks with him clearing up the yellow submarine , Pentagon style , and everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and together they could attack . Mao and Mac , Mac and Mao , I went to sleep happily .
