txt Use of the Israeli Air Force on April 7 against Syrian forces east of the Sea of Galilee is viewed here as having widespread ramifications . Above all , it is expected to demonstrate to Damascus that there is such a thing as " mutuality of violence . " " We would have preferred mutuality of peace , " Foreign Minister Abba Eban stated , " but if the Syrians use force , they should know it can not long remain a one-way affair . " Policy impact seen Since the beginning of this year , Israeli statistics show 21 Arab sabotage acts against Israel . Though armed marauders have come into this country not only from Syria but from Jordan and Lebanon too , the Israeli Government charges Damascus with primary responsibility for these acts . Friday 's Israeli-Syrian air encounter also is viewed here as giving food for thought to those great powers which recently have been making it increasingly easy to transform the Mideast into one of the most awe some regions as far as air power is concerned . The fact that Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one day ? and three of these supersonic planes in less than a single minute ? may have some impact on future policy decisions , it is said by the Israelis . ? Syria claimed it shot down five Israeli planes and killed at least 70 Israelis , according to the Associated Press . It admitted losing four of its own planes . Israel claimed none of its planes was lost . Most immediate reason for Friday 's energetic Israeli reaction was repeated Syrian shooting at Israeli farmers cultivating the thin stretch of land at the southeastern corner of the Sea of Galilee . So small is this piece of land that it has no name but is described on maps merely by plot numbers . Shooting renewed The area belongs to Kibbutz Haon , which is a neighbor of the fisherman 's kibbutz , Ein Gev , the latter famous for its Passover music festivals . Bananas and leguminous plants have been growing for 12 years without incident on Plot 52 . Last October , however , Syrian Army units suddenly began shooting at , Israeli farmers cultivating this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April 2 . Since then , the Israelis say , the Syrians replaced their initial rifle fire first with machine guns and then with artillery and tank shelling . In a hard-hitting reaction , the Israeli Government threw in its Air Force  --  and thus // *Air battle rattles peace in Mideast // brought about air contact between Israel 's French-made Mirage 3C fighters and Syria 's MIG-21 's . Israel 's main problem regarding its borders currently centers on Syria . It could be summed up as how to compel the Damascus government to follow the gxample of Israel 's other Arab neighbors . It is asserted here that , for the time being , Egypt , Jordan , and Lebanon , though talking big , carefully refrain from military clashes which could escalate into what they describe as " premature " war . Only Syria , in Israel 's view , still adheres to the doctrine that Israel should be harassed continuously by infiltrating guerrillas as well as by cross-border shootings . Limits indicated Israel 's chief of staff , Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Rabin , told the press that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are limits both to the shootings and guerrillas . " The general added , however , that he is not sure the Syrians are " good pupils who are capable of learning in the course of a single lesson . " Some time ago , Prime Minister Levi Eshkol warned the Knesset ( Israeli Parliament ) : " We shall choose ourselves the proper method and timing of our reaction to Syrian provocations . " Part of the responsibility for deteriorating border conditions is attributed to the United Nations . Cultivation in the disputed border areas was resumed last summer following a proposal by United Nations Secretary-Gen eral U Thant and Gen. Odd Bull , chief of staff of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization . Indeed General Bull succeeded in reviving the Israel-Syrian mixed armistice commission which had not met for the previous eight years . ? Commission deadlocked However , after three sessions in January , the commission deadlocked and apparently talks can not be resumed . Were UN machinery more effective , some influential Israelis contend , the Syrians might not have gained the impression they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence . Mr. Eban warned the Knesset last Wednesday that mixed-commission talks do not entitle the Syrians to unlimited sanctuary regarding any violence . Israel anticipates intense interest in any sequels to the April 7 air clash , both in the Mideast and outside . It is assumed here no effective military moves from other Arab countries are to be expected , though the others Will give political and propaganda support to Damascus . Varying degrees of understanding , though no approval , are expected from most Western capitals . The hope is that what is described here as Israel 's restraint toward Syria since last summer will be taken into account . Soviets ' dismayed ' However , considerably less cheerfulness is shown here about possible Soviet reaction . Some members of the Soviet diplomatic representation in Israel already have expressed in private talks " dismay " at what they termed Israel 's " antiprogressive " move . Since last July , Israel has claimed a total of nine Soviet-made MIGs from Syria , as well as two MIGs from the Egyptian Air Force . General Rabin denied there has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press that one of Friday 's three air battles took place " in the Damascus region " since in order to silence the Syrian artillery positions which shelled . Israeli farmers , he permitted the Israeli Air Force to cross into Syrian air space . He stressed , however , that there was an express prohibition against opening fire at any civilian targets .
