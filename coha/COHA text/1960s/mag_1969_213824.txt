Looking back on its greatest success - the Oct. 15 Moratorium Day-the multifaceted U.S. peace movement is exhilarated . Looking ahead to its plans for November , it is worried . Can the momentum be sustained ? Can violence be avoided ? Most of all , will the desire for peace prevail over the movement 's tendency to wage internal war over goals and tactics ? <P> Publicly , the factional leaders last week expressed optimism and pledged cooperation-at least through the activities scheduled for Nov. 13 , 14 and 15 . Yet privately , key participants conceded that a serious split had been narrowly averted and that basic disagreements remained unresolved . <P> The potential conflict is over how sharply the goals of the peace drive should be focused and how broad a following it should seek . The Viet Nam Moratorium Committee , which organized the Oct. 15 demonstrations , is led mainly by politically oriented moderates and liberals . Created quickly on the strength of a novel idea , it seeks the broadest possible enlistment of public opinion to persuade Congress and the President that U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasis is upon campus and community activity to get much of middle America personally involved . <P> This notion is regarded as too slow and too square by elements of the New Mobilization Committee to End the War in Viet Nam , a loose federation comprising representatives of some 50 established groups long allied with peace efforts . They include such diverse organizations as the National Council of Churches , the Socialist Workers Party , the Communist Party of the U.S.A. , the Student Mobilization Committee and the Urban Coalition . Its leaders tend to be older and in some cases more militant and more radical than the Moratorium leadership . Some of them helped organize the protests during the Democratic Convention in Chicago , and they met last summer in Cleveland to plan mass " Marches Against Death " for November in Washington and San Francisco . To many of those active in the " New Mobe , " the war is just one of the reasons for protest . They prefer dramatic tactics and appeal particularly to big-city and campus leftists . <P> Sexy Washington . Those differences posed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the Mobilization 's November marches would conflict with the simultaneous two-day Moratorium demonstrations of Nov. 13 and 14 . Moratorium leaders were not eager to dilute local activities by encouraging demonstrators to go to Washington . They also feared that a chaotic Washington protest would taint the whole peace movement and drive moderates out . <P> A crisis developed when some of the New Mobe 's most militant steering-committee members called a hurried meeting in Washington and voted to exclude businessmen and politicians from the speakers ' platform for the Washington rally . Too many such men , they argued , had either profited from or approved war appropriations . When Moratorium leaders heard of the action , they met with some of Mobilization 's less radical leaders and argued forcefully that such a move would alienate all the politicians and average that each supported the other 's November plans . <P>
