txt Tax incentives to encourage political contributions were recommended today by the Presi-. dent 's Commission on Campaign : Costs .. The bipartisan group also recommended creation of a Federal agency- to report on expenditures in Presidential election campaigns . ' The commission , appointed by President Kennedy , is headed by Dean Alexander Heard of the University of North Carolina Graduate School . It rejected proposals for direct Federa subsidies to Presidential ane . Vice-Presidential candidates . Such subsidies , it said in a report to the ' President , might have the effect of discouraging popular participation in raising funds for campaigns . Sense of Participation Through its recommendations , the commission said , " We hope to ' see a significant . increase in the number of contributors , both to spread the cost of campaigns and to diffuse more widely through the . population the sense and the reality of participation in the politics of democracy. , " At his news conference , President Kennedy said the report " ii . now being examined by the Administration , and will be the basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement , Page 16.1 He did not specify which of the various proposals would be sent to Congress , but he said they would " provide a significant advancement of the public interest in this very vital field . " 2 Incentives Backed The recommendations for tax incentives took two forms  --  a tax credit to benefit small contributors to Presidential and Vice - Presidential campaigns , and a tax deduction for those giving up to $1,000 . The Federal agency would be called the Registry of Election Finance . It would be empowered to collect detailed reports on political contributions and expenditures in Presidential and Vice - . Presidential campaigns , publicize the reports and refer infractions of law to appropriate enforcement authorities . The ? registry would have a nonpartisan or bipartisan advisory . board . Other recommendations were : gInereased participation by individuals and organizations , including corporations and unions , in bipartisan or multipartisan political . activities , such as . registration drives and joint appearances of candidates . qContinued prohibition of partisan contributions by corporations or unions , and equal treatment of each in this regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeal of the present $3,000,000 ceiling on annual expenditures by interstate political committees and the . $5,000 ceiling on individual annual contributions to them . qImprovement of party fundraising . techniques and cutting campaign costs through inaproved methods . qFederal financing of the " transition period " between the election of a President and his inauguration , when he must form his Administration . Further temporary suspension of the " equal-time " provision in the Federal Communications Act to make it possible for radio and television stations to provide more free time to major candidates . ( IA White House conference on campaign finance , and further state and Federal studies on the problem . Order Issued Nov. 8 Mr. Kennedy , in an Executive order last Nov. 8 , instructed the group to " make recommendations with respect to improved ways of financing expenditures required of nominees for the offices of President and Vice President . " The commission 's report was unanimous . Eleven meetings of the full commission and many subcommittee sessions were held during the group 's study of the problem . The tax incentives were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributors would work as follows : From the amount of Federal income tax owed in a given year , a taxpayer could subtract half his total political contributions . The amount to be subtracted could not total more than $10 , or $20 where a husband and wife file a joint return . Thus , a taxpayer owing $100 in income tax for a given year , but who had contributed $15 to a party , could subtract $7.50 , or half his contribution , and would pay a tax of $92.50 . Had he contributed $25 , however , he could subtract only the maximum of $10 and would pay a $90 tax . The deduction from taxable income for larger contributors would be figured by the taxpayer just as he now calculates deductions for charitable contributions , except that no deduction would be granted for more than $1,000 on a return . " We hope ? that this incentive to medium-sized gifts , coupled with the incentive to small gifts , will stimulate the massive giving needed by the parties , " the report said . " If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitable . " The commission warned that " the bulk of Presidential campaign funds available to both parties is now supplied by a relatively small group of contributors gwing sums ranging from a few hundred to several thousands of dollars . " To safeguard the tax-incentive proposals , it was recommended that the credit or deduction be allowed only for gifts to the national committee of a party , or to a single committee designated by each party in each state . Regarding eligibility , a national political party would be considered as such if it were on the ballot in ten or more states . The report recommended that the tax incentives , which would have to be authorized by Congress , be provided for an experimental period that would include two Presidential campaigns or at least until 1968 . Then their effects would be reviewed and the incentives continued , widened or ended . Congressional actions would also be required to set up the proposed registry . Detailed reports on contributions and disbursements would be made to it each year by the following : All political committees of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election of Presidential or VicePresidential candidates , if they raised or spent at least $2,500 . All candidates for nomina- , tion or election as President or Vice President . All delegates or candidates for delegate to Presidential nominating conventions . Any individual or family contributing to such committees or candidates , or spending in their behalf , whether for party nomination or election , an aggregate of $5,000 or more a year . Individuals or groups spending at least $5,000 a year for bipartisan political activities : " Active , widespread political participation is the key to suc cessful democracy in the United States , " the report said , " and voluntary effort is the great sustaining force of our political parties . " While it rejected Federal subsidies , the commission suggested a further study of " a matching incentive plan " involving Government contributions . Under the plan , individual contributions of S10 or less tol designated political groups ! would be deposited in the ! Treasury and matched with , Federal funds , up to a total of , ' perhaps $5,000,000 . Party Chiefs Hail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic National Chairman , John M. Bailey of Connecticut , described the commission 's report as excellent and expressed the hope that Congress would act promptly to carry out its recommendations . Representative William E. Miller of upstate New York . the Republican National Chairman , also said he was in accord with the commission ?
