" Welcome to Haiti , " read the huge sign on Port-au-Prince 's Main Street near Bowen Airport . Near by , tied to a wooden chair in a police pickup truck , was a bloated yellow corpse , covered with flies . The display , on view for 24 hours and set up just 15 days after Haiti kicked off a major tourist campaign , was one more warning from Dictator Franois Duvalier to his fellow Haitians : stay tame , or else . <P> The body was the grisliest evidence yet that the guerrilla war in Haiti 's backlands is not going well for Duvalier . According to reports filtering out of Haiti , three separate bands of rebels are fighting in southern and western Haiti-two groups , with about 80 men , calling themselves the " Haitian Revolutionary Armed Forces " and another independent band of 100 . Since the first skirmishes eight weeks ago , the rebels have killed at least 80 Duvalier militiamen , have shot one of Duvalier 's three AT6 patrol planes out of the sky , and have blown up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reportedly raided and looted an armory 38 miles southeast of Port-au-Prince , then two days later sacked another military post 20 miles away . Haitians crossing over into the neighboring Dominican Republic say that the rebels effectively control half a dozen villages in the rugged Massif de la Selle . <P> Whether the guerrillas pose a serious threat to Papa Doc 's dictatorship remains to be seen . But his nerves are starting to show . His internal military radio in Port-au-Prince has been heard exhorting militiamen in the field to capture " just one-just one prisoner . " The militia commander replied that he could not even get a clear view of the guerrillas , much less catch one . Duvalier claims that the rebels are Communists from Cuba , has asked the U.S. to run reconnaissance flights over the Windward Passage . The U.S. found no evidence of any Cuban invasion effort . <P> The fact is that the rebels are mostly the sons of middle-class Haitians driven into exile by Duvalier , and could come from anywhere around the Caribbean .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
