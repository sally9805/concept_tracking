txt The Columbia University Send ate adopted a resolution last night putting the university on . record against the war in ' Vietnam and recommending immediate withdrawal of American troops as " the most reasonable plan for peace . " The resolution was approved after a nearly two-hour debate marked by eloquence , , high emotion and the sense that the members were committing the university rather than ' just themselves for the first time on a highly controversial political issue . The vote of the senate , which is composed of faculty members , students and administrators , was 51 in favor , 25 opposed and three abstentions . The feel of the meeting , held in a bland , gray and creme // colored lecture hall on the third floor of Uris Hall , seemed to shift several times . Amendment followed amendment as ' he participants struggled to describe their attitudes accurately . Several prominent professors who stated their deep opposition-to the war but Were reluctant to compromise the university 's neutrality on a political issue finally approved the measure . Among these were Fred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Robert Gorham Davis , professor of English . President Andrew W. Cordier presided over the stormy session and , therefore , did not vote , but he made his own position clear at the end of the debate with these words : " I share the abhorrence of all of you to this war . The conflict has become more and ' more shameful . It is a war that can not be won . I see no way out of it in any traditional sense as honorable . " But Dr. Cordier also took ' issue with those who had said that the resolution , if adopted , would reflect the attitude of the . senate rather than the uni versity as a whole . Characterizing the senate , which was established last May , as the administrative body of the university second only to the trustees , he said : " It does speak for the university . " Then , without directly asking the senate to reject the motion , Dr. Cordier said that when he spoke out against the war he did so as an individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implied that this was the proper course . But in a series of six votes in which the resolution was voted upon , sentence by sentence , the participants gave their concurrence to the measure and adjourned . The abrupt adjournment left undiscussed three substantive issues that had been on the agenda ahead of the Vietnam resolution , but which the meeting voted to take up last . These , presumably , will be taken up at the senate 's next meeting , on Oct. 24 . The postponed discussions were of resolutions on government demands for confidential information in university files , on recruiting on campus and on the joining of the university 's three graduate faculties into a single Graduate School of Arts and Sciences . The senate 's meeting last night was the first of the current academic year . At its only previous meeting , last May , the senate had given most of its time to organizing- itself as the body that is to restructure the university and give voice to representative voices among students and faculty . The resolution adopted by the senate says : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war in Vietnam . While as individuals we differ in detail , this body agrees that the most reasonable plan for peace is the /immediate withdrawal of all U.S. troops . We join in a united and continuous national effort to bring our troops home . " Therefore , be it resolved , that the Columbia University Senate authorizes students , faculty and staff who wish to participate in and/or observe the Oct. 15 Moratorium- for Peace be permitted to do so without penalty or prejudice . This authorization will make possible the widest participation in the educational and memorial programs being planned . " The resOlution was drafted by the caucus of 21 student members of the senate and was jointly sponsored by the caucus of the 15 members who are non-tenured faculty members . Other members of the 101-member body are 42 tenured facuty members , nine administrative officers , six representatives of affiliated colleges , two alumni , two administrative staff members , two research associates and two professional librarians . Ninety members attended the session and perhaps a third of them participated in the de-I bate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the war ; the argument centered on the propriety of the senate , and and through it the university , getting involved in a political controversy . On this issue , Douglas Hunt , vice president of . the university for finance , said : " It is not wise for ' this body to express an opinion for the university by fiat . Truth gets followed here by individuals , by lonely people in laboratories and studies . We must not try ? to legislate opinions for ' other people . " But Victor Futter , alumni representative from Columbia College , the undergraduate men 's division of ' the university , replied : " There is a duty to express moral opinions . The war in Vietnam lay at the base ' of all the disruption here two years ago . You give up your opportunity to restructure Columbia if you give up your chance to , express a view on the paramount moral issue of our time . " Faris Bouhafa , a representative of the college and one of the principal drafters of the resolution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a memorial meeting for the war , dead , student - sponsored programs , seminars run by faculty , members and a large assembly on campus to which prominent political figures will be invited . The programs are being planned in conjunction with a nationwide protest against the war sponsored by student , peace and leftist groups .
