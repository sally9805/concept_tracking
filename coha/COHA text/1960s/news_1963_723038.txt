txt Letters to The Times Letters to The Times Civic Center Plan Opposed City 's Finances , Dislocation in Area Cited in Protesting Project TontrEDITOR Tne Navy YORK Tugs : Reading your April 3 editorial " School Emergency , " it is difficult to understand why the City Planning Commission is proposing to build in these critical times a civic center park that will cost the taxpayers over $200 million when the city is in desperate financial plight . Recently Mayor Wagner disclosed a pending $235 million ? municipal deficit , He has also obtained authorization from the State Legislature to impose new taxes . A committee representing hundreds of business establishments large and small in the City HallFoley Square area directly affected by the proposed civic center has been organized to oppose the present plan . We feel the proposal now before the Planning Commission , requiring extensive condemnation , relocation and demolition in a vital commercial area ( Chambers to Canal Street along Broadway ) , is ill-conceived , unduly expensive and will unnecessarily displace a much-needed source of city tax revenues . Heavy unemployment will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civic center . But we contend that the City Planning Commission has acted with suspicious ' haste in attempting to " railroad " through the present plan , especially since the current proposal represents a switch from a site in the area east of City Hall at Pearl and New Chambers Streets , already owned by the city and for the most part already cleared and untenanted . We ask that additional studies . be considered before making a final determination on a project of this magnitude . Moreover , we ask that a hearing before the commission be reopened to give the public a chance to be heard on this matter . The commission has adamantly refused this request after holding what could be considered a " drum-head proceeding " on March 13 . No adequate notice was given , and we were allowed 30 minutes in which to state our case . What is needed is time to take a hard look at the hasty adoption of this dubious architectural dream . HENRY MODELL , Chairman , Committee for an Intelligent Civic Center Plan . New York , April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YoRx TIMES : I was very happy to read in The New York Times of April 8 that Roman Catholic Bishop Carter of Saulte Ste. Marie , Ontario , following the Pope 's wishes to try to bring peoples of all faiths and nations closer together , said to a Protestant group : " We have more in common than we have separating us . It is so much easier to fear , hate , suspect or despise a person when you 've never met him . " I hope that the Roman Catholic hierarchy in the United States of America will take these words to heart and cease  --  obstructing Federal aid to education . Their support and wisdom are needed to make the nation 's public schools the best they possibly can be , for these schools are the basis of our national unity . Surely a church which has done so much to combat racial segregation can not logically or with a good conscience support religious segregation . Let us all remember Jesus 's words : " In my Father 's house are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " CONSTANCE LOVEJOY . New York , April 9 , 1963 . TFX Decision Defended To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In a surprisingly unsubtle editorial on the TFX ( April 4 ) , The Times criticized Defense Secretary for settling for a " second best , " " Jack-of-all-trades " aircraft for purely economic considerations . That the TFX does not entirely meet the special requirements of nch service iv undeniable . But one me. look at the whole defense structure before a reasoned judgment can be . made on Secretary 's decision . Manned aircraft for some time now has been in the process of being phased out  --  substantially if not completely . The amazing and increasingly rapid improvement of our missile arsenal is the obvious reason . For some tangible and more emotional reasons , this phasing out has met with considerable high echelon opposition . Almost all high Air Force officers have wings . While this is not true for the Navy , many more officers , especially at high ranks , are needed to man aircraft carriers than Polaris submarines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that both services would want the most effective aircraft possible , one which would lengthen the usefulness of carriers and pilots . Secretary is rightfunp not concerned with prolonging the usefulness of any particular weapons system per se . He must account for its cost and its position in the over-all defense structure , He is to be applauded for applying a rational system of priorities in the face of irrational and traditional opposition . It was a courageous and necessary step . CIIRIS VASILLOPULOS . Geneva , N. Y. , April 4 , 1963 . Redistricting States Correction of Voting Inequities in Florida and California Upheld TO THE EDITOR OF TI1E NEW YORK TIMES : The New York Times is to bo congratulated on the exceptionally fine statements it has made in its editorial columns on the subject of legislative apportionment . It is obvious that not all Times writers agree with the paper 's position ? Arthur Krock in particular . While one may disagree with his position , Mr. Krock is to be commended for his complete honesty in presenting some rather classically conservative ideas . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewpoint . Now , however , I must protest . He recently wrote that the citizens of Florida and California " whose families have been here for generations " may become particular victims of the wave of egalitarianism initiated by our nation 's highest tribunal through its decisions in Baker v. Carr and Gray v. Sanders . This is unfair to the Boston Brahmins who have been inundated by the Irish  --  even to living to seo one of them in the White House . What of the children of the Dutch patroons who struggled to establish New Amsterdam , only to be overwhelmed by English , Italians , Jews , Russians , Irish , Germans , Negroes and Puerto Ricans ? Arizona 's Dilemma Most deprived of all are the descendants of early Arizona inhabitants . The settlers of Florida might have had to fight off " hostile Indians , " but these poor ArizonianS had it a lot worse  --  they had to fight off hostile Caucasians  --  and they lost ! Neither the Navajo nor Apache people ( some 70,000 strong ) get any vote at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white man arrived , one can go even further back and ask what has happened to the children of the Hopi and Zuni ? First the Navajo and Apache descended on them and then the white man came a-booming in , 700 years later . Really , the old-line families of Florida and California have it pretty good . Almost all the rest of the country was overrun by destitute , illiterate immigrants who could only offer the sweat of their brow as a contribution to building up the state . Florida and California hitve been getting people of proved talent and frequently great wealth . For the past 20 years these newcomers have been building up those States at a rate unparalleled in human history . In fact , these " immigrants " are making millionaires out of many of the children of the good old families  --  more than one dairy , chicken farm , orange grove or swamp has been converted into a 50,000-population housing tract . The new Floridians and Californians are not out to depose the Spanish landowners that the oldtimers ' families robbed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counted as exactly equal with the descendants of good families , This does n't seem so terribly unjust . Some people even think it democratic . WILLIAM J. D. BOYD , Member , Executive Committee , New York State Committee for Fair Representation . New York , April 3 , 1963 . Worsening of Mail Service TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Can anyone explain the suddden deterioration in the delivery of first and second-class mail in this city ? I have occasion to send notices of a periodic meeting , From the comparatively small number of persons involved I have had a large number of complaints over the last few weeks that the letters arrived a week or two late or not at all , Our local church in Postal Zone 27 sends members its magazine every month . The periodicals had been arriving promptly for years , but now they can be three or four weeks late . In brief , there is a sudden frustrating undependability about the mails . What can be done about it ? JAMES E. KINNEAR . New York , April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
