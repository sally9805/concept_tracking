txt Bedlam broke out in the courtroom here tonight while Judge Charles L. Larson was commending a jury that had just found 12 war protesters guilty of theft , burglary and arson in the destruction of draft records . Before the chaos was over , four of the defendants , including one of five priests , had been cited for contempt and the police had been ordered to arrest protesting spectators " if you can identify them . " The 12 defendants were part of the " Milwaukee 14 , " one of several groups that have destroyed draft records to dramatize their opposition to awl war , and the Milwaukee Circuit Court room was jammed with more than 100 supporters . The . two-week trial ended tonight after the jury of four women and eight men had deIliberated an hour and 10 mintiles . As the 61-year-old judge praised the jurors for a " coll . CU i job in the face of a courtroom filled with supporters of the defendants , " spectators began popping up to shout their disagreement . " If they are guilty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will be a draft resister , " one youth began . " Remove him from the courtroom ' , " the judge told the armed bailiffs . " We thank you , men and women of the jury , " shouted a young woman in the back of Ithe room , " for finding Jesus ' Christ guilty again . " Most of the audience of about 150 persons broke . into prolonged applause . Many wept . The judge called for order . ) Bailiffs brought audience demonstrators before the bench , filling the well of the court . Loud singing of " We Shall Overcome " broke out among Spectators still in their seats. , ' Spectators in the audience ands in the well linked arms and ' swayed to protest songs . Singing Grows Louder During the disorder , the judge completed his dismissal of the jury but the jurors had trouble picking their way out of the courtroom , around and through the standing throng . The singing grew in voluble . Judge Larson stood behind-the bench and . shouted , apparently to his clerk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more policemen . Clear the court . I 've got to have many more sheriffs . " Nothing happened , except that the few overworked bailiffs were trying to , drag spectators , many of whom went limp in the aisles , out of the courtroom . " Good God , " said the judge , " I asked for more policemen . " About 18 . arrived eventually and began throwing men .. and women out bodily . In the hall the audience regrouped , and continued singing . " You ought to be ashamed , b pitchina - pregnant women around like that , " one protester shouted as a girl was hurled from the courtroom . After 20 minutes , a measure of order was restored , but the judge 's tribulations were not over . As he announced the court 's findings , based on the jury verdict , each defendant was directed to stand . Some refused . Others shouted disagreement with the judge . " I pity the nation that fears its young , " said the Rev. Antony J. Mullaney of Boston . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fred J. Ojile , a 23-yearrold Minneapolis draft counselor , and Douglas I. Marvey , 27 , also of Minneapolis , to 10 days in jail or a $50 fine for contempt . He said they had been inso ? lent and had shown disrespect for the court 's authority . " Judge , you just lost your authority , whether you know it or not , " interjected the Rev. James W. Harney of Cambridge , Mass . " Father Harney , please . . . " Judge Larson began . After two more outbursts from the 29-year-old priest , Judge Larson pronounced the same contempt sentence on him . The jurist then said that during . the trial the Rev. Jon H. Higgenbotham Jr .. of- Washington had " uttered the name of the . Son of God " and was being held in contempt and sentenced to , five days in jail or a $25 fine . " Is that wrong ? " Father Harney asked the court after the judge announced what Mr. Higgenbotham , of the , nonsectarian Curch of Scientology , had said . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be allowed to serve , the contempt sentence for Mr. ' Ojile because , he argued , the ' young Minnesotan had a pregnant wife . " It does n't work that way , Father , " Judge Larson said . He set sentencing on the theft , arson and burglary charges for June 6 , and ordered the defendants released on bail . In an anteroom later , he told the police force that ' had gathered that he could not identify the spectators who had " swayed in court " but that if any of the policemen could they should arrest them on contempt ' charges . Admit Burning Files As the defendants left the . courtroom , they were greeted - with loud applause from their supporters , who had waited in the hall . The police moved to the hall and prodded them into elevators and out of the building . The defendants conceded frequently during the trial that they had taken and burned thousands of Selective Service files here last Sept. 24 . But . the 12 contended that the act was justifiable civil disobedience as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illegal ' and immoral , and the draft , which they called involuntary servitude and an unconstitutional restriction on democratic free-1 dom of decision . Judge Larson instructed the predominantly Roman Catholic jury that " the law does not recognize political , religious or moral convictions , or some higher law , as justification for the commission of a crime , no matter how good the motive may be . " " People who ? believe that the ' Vietnam war is illegal or unI constitutional or morally wrong have the right to protest in various ways , " he said , " but they have no right to protest by violating valid laws . " In closing arguments earlier today ( the defendants had urged , the jurors to make the day " historic " by " using the law cre-atively : " A not guilty verdict , said Father Janicke , would condemn the war and help to " move the country from the violent to a nonviolent way of life . " " You can help in an important way to turn around our national priorities , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose-colored glasses and see beyond the narrow charges of burglary , arson and theft . " The three state charges carry maximum possible punishment for each defendant of 18 years in prison . The other two of the Milwaukee 141'will be tried on the state charges later . Then all 14 face Federal charges , of destroying Government property , interfering with the admini'str'ation of the Selective Service system and conspiracy to do ' so .
