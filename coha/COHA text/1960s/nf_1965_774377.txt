txt  | And if you have n't been initiated into the paper towel routine in your bathroom , do get in line ! All those jokes about " guest towels " were n't exaggerated . Everybody shied away from the pristine freshness of the guest towels and furtively used the corner of somebody 's bath towel . Today with all the glamorous stripes , florals , and checks in soft-as-silk paper they not only prove a practical addition but add a slash of vivid color besides . Big , soft paper napkins in both white and color have shoved the old napkin ring right off the table . To show how much a part of life paper napkins have become I love the story about the little boy who reporting on a visit to his grandmother 's said , " Instead of napkins we had big square pieces of cloth ! " If you have n't given paper a " whirl " in your house , you 'll find it an inexpensive way to bring variety into every room . Try it ! Draperies seem to be such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in doubt ? use white ! And sometimes some windows would be much better off with no draperies but just some crisp white curtains . Some poor windows are so swathed with layers of fabric that you wonder how the inhabitants know what kind of weather it is outside . Cafes made of white corduroy , pique , muslin , Indian head , or any of the drip-dry fabrics may be enhanced by adding fringe , pompom braid , ric-rac braid , or saucy little tassels . Curtains are easy to make . And you 'll find that they are much less expensive when you buy the by-the-yard fabric instead of choosing the already made ones . You 'll have more original curtains too . White can be as dramatic as any bright color if it is used right . With a lot of color in a room , try white curtains , a  | washable white rug , and all-white accessories and you 'll know what I mean by the magic of white . Do n't think that you always have to have draperies . Some of the newer types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superfluous . Remember , when in doubt , try white at your windows for that fresh as a daisy look ! As you know , I am a great believer in " mixing " furniture . I do n't see any reason in the world why cherry , maple , pine , or light mahogany ca n't mingle congenially together in one room provided a little taste is used in the assembling of the conglomeration . It is n't the difference in wood that you have to worry about as much as it is the style or shape . For instance , I have just seen a collection of new Danish furniture , very attractive , true , but I would n't like to see " the egg chair " or " the swan chair " sitting next to a deacon 's bench in an early American room . When I say , " go ahead , do n't be afraid to use Danish modern with your more traditional pieces " I am not talking about the swan chair or egg chair type of Danish furniture . I am referring to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not chairs on four-pronged legs that look as if they were some open-mouthed animal waiting to devour you when you sit down . That 's why " taste " is such an important partner when you buy . There 's no rule about these things , but you have to " feel " that the chair you are looking at just would n't fit in with your other furniture . Got that feeling ? Then today 's a good day to buy ! " Hi ! What 's new ? " How many times have you listened to that salutation as friends greet each other outside of their office door , in a restaurant , or on a bus ? Today we 're  | answering that query in our own way . Here are bits of this and that which may not all be new to you , but seems worthy of mention . What 's new ? A specially treated , fire-resistant , washable fabric wallcovering that is really cotton but has a linen look and comes in standard wallpaper width and , best of all , can be applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It comes in thirteen solid colors , even deep shades , as well as pastels and six prints . What 's new ? Did you know that now you can get canopy top curtains , and bedspread in drip-dry dotted Swiss organdy of dacron ? Fluff without fatigue ! What 's new ? Have you seen those foot-and-a-half wastebaskets of raffia in hot pink , gold , violet , turquoise , orange , olive green , or black ? Quite a color pick-up from sunny Italy to you ! There 's an attractive place in the little town of Waterford , Connecticut , that specializes in early American furniture , and as an ad feature they put out a little brochure called " The Colonial Gazette . " It 's full of early American chit-chat and I thought this one little paragraph under the title of " The Looking Glass " might interest you . " Early American homemakers were just as fond of color as modern decorators are . They loved to brighten their homes with brilliant accents of red , yellow , green and blue . In many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity . They painted a chair to make it prettier , or to hide the variations in the wood used . In other cases , the colonists chose painted furniture just because they liked it ? Lambert Hitchcock 's famous fancy chairs ' for instance . If you want to give your decorating a quick , gay look which is comfortable  | in almost any room , choose a colorful painted or stenciled colonial piece . " And I must add , not only colonial pieces but unpainted modern chairs , chests , and desks painted to match the walls or in a wildly contrasting color can make a room that has been tip-toeing along in colorless ennui suddenly spring into vibrant life . So if you have been wondering what to do with that nondescript chair or chest of drawers , why not experiment with a dab of paint ? This is one do-it-yourself job that any amateur ca n't mess up too badly and the results often can be magic in a room . Match or contrast your chosen color with your walls ? but get busy ! A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back from Japan and had brought back with her the feeling of the Orient in some pieces which she had assembled most attractively in her house . Instead of lamp tables she used teakwood cabinets with little doors and rich Oriental brasses . The cabinets proved most practical and did away with the usual living room clutter of odds and ends . My friend was most impressed with the Japanese feeling for order and space in their houses . She said she had come home and got rid of many things that she had decided added nothing and were merely space fillers . With Japanese prints on the walls and Japanese china in her dining room , this English house had quite an intriguing flavor of the Orient . No matter how short a trip your take , bring home one memento . It adds interest to every house ! For new brides , or old brides who are tired of their worn-out dining room set , do investigate the new metal furniture ! The tables and chairs that once were relegated to  | the patio are now finding their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a meadow . Some tables have white formica tops with the metal part painted with touches of gold . Some chairs have turquoise blue seats , but they come in almost any color you have been dreaming of and can do a lot to vitalize a tired dining room . Of course , the room needs to be a small , intimate sort of room , and do n't try mixing the metal with mahogany . And while we 're on the subject of dining rooms , have you seen the colorful new array of china in the stores ? Cups and saucers in the most fascinating colors ? orange , black , cinnamon brown , daffodil yellow . It makes you feel good just to look at them . So do get at least a couple and invite a neighbor in for tea ! If it 's the time of year when you feel the need of a change or the sight of something new , no matter how small , here are a few suggestions to try out on your house : Baskets are inexpensive and fun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolls , as flower pots , to hold your logs in front of the fireplace , to guard unanswered mail , to hold your kitchen vegetables . Benches are back and in demand as coffee tables , to hold the television set , for the foot of the bed , in the playroom , on the patio . Brush a fresh coat of paint in a provocative new color on your front door . Get new bath towels in a never-had-before shade . Rearrange your furniture for a new look . Douse your house in cheerful color and then see that YOU live up to it !  | Have you been reading in the magazines and newspapers lately about the " country look " ? It has a cheerful , homey sound , has n't it ? And the nice part about it is that you do n't have to live in the country to acquire " that look . " You can bring some of the magic of the country right into your apartment today with country furniture , wallpaper , or wood paneling , braided rugs , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner table , why not set up a table with a bold black-and-white checked cloth with red napkins the color of the local fire engine . A bowl of red , red apples and two candlesticks with white candles would set the scene for a happy and hearty country dinner of a succulent beef stew with potato dumplings , a salad , and apple pie a-la-mode . ( This is not the night for calorie counting . ) If you long for country life , why not " play country " in your apartment . I 'm glad to see that at last people are getting bolder . It makes me happy to see that you want to get away from the Joneses , want to try something new . It 's a cheering thought that the wishy-washy peach and the muddy tans have had their last gasp . ( I hope . ) All across the country everybody seems to be alert to the tang of tangerine and lemon-peel yellow , to the freshness of turquoise , and even color schemes using brilliant geranium pink and regimental red are being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time when nobody would dare to combine red and pink , or red , pink , and orange , but done with taste , the result can be as fresh and pretty as a sparkling glass of lemonade with a strawberry floating on top . So ? be bold ! Be brave ! Be experimental ! Dare to be different !  | We might as well face it , this is the age of the room divider ! Sometimes you can rearrange your furniture for an attractive and practical " blockade . " Two chairs with a table in between may do the trick . Or use your long bookcase with an impressive bunch of rhododendron leaves on the top . Or simply stand a four-fold shutter screen or a plain screen with paintings hung on it in the space you want to " divide . " Someone I know put out an old sea chest of her grandfather 's and flanked it with two narrow modern high-backed chairs . With a lamp and ashtrays on the chest you forgot that this trio was a room divider and just enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting bibelots and a few plants on top perform a good " dividing " role . Or a couple of make-believe trees in a white pebbled wooden trough bring a little of uncluttered nature into the living room in a pleasantly practical fashion . If you must " divide , " think up something that will suit your room to a T ! And be sure to " add " and not " subtract " from the looks of your room ! If you happen to go away for the week end , or even if you just have spent a few hours in a movie and so are temporarily removed from your daily life , stop as you re-enter your house and look about you . Try to see your rooms as if you were a total stranger seeing them for the first time and decide whether they satisfy your taste . If they do n't , try to put your finger on the reason . Perhaps it is color . Have you used too many ? Too much ? Not enough ? Not the right combination ? Be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By honest colors I do not necessarily mean bright shades . A light powder blue is just as valuable as dark dahlia red as long as it is n't wishy-washy.  | Clear fresh splashes of color can do more for a room than any other one thing . Try it and see ! " The world is so full of a number of things , " and some of the " things " in the world today make life much more pleasant for all of us . Here are a few suggestions I picked up here and there recently . Expensive , but exciting ? the new Spanish rugs and matching bedspreads .... Disguising an ugly air conditioner with a huge folded paper fan made from the wallpaper used on the wall . . . . If you have a large foyer going to waste , install a good-looking desk and chair and use it as your private home office .... Have you seen the new " paint by numbers " method for painting your own wall mural ? In complete kits , you may choose modern , provincial , oriental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shutter treatment at your windows , use the shutters part way and hang a gay fringed swag at the top of the windows . . . . A reproduction of one of the old gas street lamps in your foyer makes a great conversation piece . . . . Dress up a child 's room with a gay striped awning at the window on the inside of the room ... . Why have a dull old plain wall-to-wall carpet when you can find rugs with sprays of flowers , fountains , spurting a bouquet of colors ? plaids and figures that bring a dazzle into a room ? . . . And just the addition of a vivid stair carpet often will give that magic touch to a dark hall . . . . Yes , the world is full of a number of things . Why not try a few today ? So often hallways and foyers seem like the black sheep of the family . You may have all the right furniture , but what about the walls ? That is the place that shows the most neglect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some sort from floorboard to ceiling ? They wo n't get in  | your way and they create a cozy atmosphere . Hanging shelves , interesting personal phenomena picked up here and there , an intriguing piece of driftwood , old hardware , like wing-shaped black hinges with inspired curlycues ? anything to " furnish " the walls . An attractive light , either hanging from the ceiling , or standing on a just-right table works its own magic of welcome . And if you have room , a small bench with a pair of pillows in " Hey-there ! " colors is not only a charming fill-in , but a practical addition for putting on galoshes , etc . One city foyer I admire has a make-believe tree in a shiny daffodil-yellow bucket . The floor is in wide black and white stripes , and the wall is covered with bold black and white pictures , all with yellow mats . A shiny black chair , with a daffodil-yellow cushion stands primly by a table . It 's a perfect introduction to the rooms beyond the front door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of decorating with fruit ? Most people think of using fruit as a decoration only at Christmas time , but it 's the freshest and most inexpensive way I know of getting a special color in the spot it 's most needed . To break up the monotony of a charcoal gray , scarlet , and black color scheme ( with white walls ) a friend of mine got four inexpensive picture frames and pasted in Chinese yellow mats , then cut out some very intriguing old prints and pasted those on the mats . The result was delightful but she needed something yellow on the opposite side of the room to balance that yellow spot of color . Being ingenious , she piled an emerald-green glass bowl with fresh yellow lemons and tucked in a few lemon leaves . It did the trick ! A wooden salad bowl brimming with a grapefruit and oranges , a white tureen filled with juicy red apples , a basket  | of avocado pears and purple plums , a copper pot with Golden Delicious apples and a dripping bunch of grapes ? try any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living room , even bedroom , for a merry splash of color . How would you like to step on a rainbow ? Would n't it be an exciting experience ? all those gorgeous strips of color at your feet ! Well , we 're sorry , but we ca n't pluck down that rainbow just for you , but we do have a suggestion that is almost as good ! The rugs of today ! Even if you are n't in the market for a rug you must go and wander through today 's magic carpet land . Such fabulous colors ! Such juicy combinations ! Such stripes , plaids , borders ? such a variety ! Deep cotton pile rugs , machine washable , moth- and mildew-proof ( so do n't say I 'm not practical ) in an array of colors from cloud white , copper , sand beige , fire red , brass , Sherwood green , hot orange , gold , salt and pepper , shadow green , gray mist , and petal pink to wedgwood blue . And then those fluffy fur-looking rugs , also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , orange , lilac , black , white , avocado , suede , larkspur blue , copen blue , shadow green , and moss green . Think of stepping out of bed onto a larkspur blue furry rug when the temperature is down on the frost line . And speaking of rugs , always place furniture on or off a rug ? never half on , half off . Now ! Do n't let the choice of a rug be such a chore ! Let it be an adventure and make it a colorful one ! In very large type , the other day , in a very large ad with a drawing of a very large lamp were the words , " One important lamp can work magic in your room . " And I said  | to myself , " Well , maybe ! But it also can stand out like a sore thumb if the rest of the lamps look like something you picked up at a church sale . " It 's easier , it seems to me , if you have at least one pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , have the shades about the same size or the room will have a jumpy effect . Have n't you seen those tiny hexagonal silk shades sitting daintily on a lamp at a desk , and at the next table will be a great white base with a " big-hat " modern shade looking like a brassy wench with hands on hips , cowering that poor little silk shade into oblivion ? There must be a feeling of balance in your lamp and shades . High lamps belong on low tables or chests . There is nothing more awkward than a lamp that seems to go up and up ceilingward for no other reason than it has been placed on a too-high perch for its size . If you want to work real " magic " in your room , do n't concentrate on one important lamp , have lights that can all work their magic in the gloaming ! Although Mother Nature has n't written a book , she is continually giving us visual proof of her know-how when it comes to color . In the spring when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wakes us up with bright sprays of yellow forsythia , mimosa , or stalks of crisp golden daffodils . A wonderful idea ? that touch of fresh yellow to spring on your own house after the winter doldrums . Then in summer nature emphasizes the cool crisp green of the grass , the green leaves , the white of the syringa bush , the blush-pink of the rose to inspire us with the idea that these are the colors for summer , along with the vivid accents of the purple iris and the salmon-colored phlox .  | In the fall she tosses out her palette of harvest colors , the beige of a dried corn husk , the yellow of the pumpkin , the russets and reds of apples , the amber of sweet cider , and the burning-bright orange of the autumn leaves . Winter , nature says , is for holly berry red and pine green , and poinsettia red with black crows in a field of new snow for accents . Why not watch nature for your color schemes ? A friend of mine said not long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , " Do n't do that ' type of column . It 's so definite . " So this is for the people who like some decorating do 's and don'ts in capsule doses . DO N'T put a table with a lamp on it smack in the middle of a picture window . DO make an inviting place to sit and enjoy a cup of coffee and the view . DO N'T have a fireplace and never light it . DO enjoy the relaxing mood that a crackling fire invites . DO N'T use a murky , muddy color even if it is in vogue . DO use clear , fresh colors to give you a happy outlook . DO N'T hold on to wilted , half-dead flower arrangements . DO experiment with the new crisp long-lasting make-believes . DO N'T stifle any individual ideas . DO BE creative . Use your ingenuity and wallow in lovely colors ! Recently a suggestion for a discerning hostess read , " At your next dinner party fill two or three of these graceful and unusual crystal pitchers with fresh cut flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess how much these decorative little pitchers cost ? Hold your breath-$37.50 each ! Now is n't that  | silly ? Who in the world could afford $112.50 worth of vases before you even had bought one posy to go in them ? I agree that nothing adds a jot of color to a room like a mass of blossoms . But you do n't have to rob a bank to find something interesting to hold flowers . I have seen those tall tin cans that fruit juices come in , with the paper wrapping removed and with black stripes on them , looking most glamorous filled with red , orange , and yellow zinnias . Watermelon-pink geraniums in snow-white pots marching down the center of a table with candles in simple candle sticks can bring an " all " to any ( lining room . What is prettier than a shiny dark brown earthenware pitcher brimming over with white daisies or black-eyed Susans ? Do use more flowers around in every room , not just in the dining and living rooms , but in the bathroom , kitchen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't find anywhere else ! Are you planning to build a new house this year ? Everybody else seems to be ! If you are , there are a few things that may help to make life easier later on . Before you buy your furniture , make a plan of each room , with the measurements of wall space , windows , etc . Everybody gets so excited over whether to get a beige or black sofa they forget to measure to see whether a sectional or straight type would look better in the space they have . Shop around and when you have decided on what you want , ask yourself , " How many friends do I expect to have in at one time ? Have I planned a place to write ? A place to play games ? Enough room for cocktails or tea ? Do I want twin beds or one large bed ? Have I enough storage space ? Closet room ? etc. "  | In other words , take time to plan before you buy . And a good talk with the store decorator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how even the best of us can get into a color rut . I 'm surprised at myself . I have been using a white tablecloth sprinkled with moss roses and was quite happy with it . Everyone always exclaimed over it whenever I set up two card tables informally on either side of the living room in front of the two eighteenth-century settees with cushions of bright turquoise satin . Then the other day at one of the well-known department stores I bought two of the most delightful tablecloths , a heavy white linen with a bold modern design ( on the part that hangs below the table ) of green leaves and huge scarlet apples outlined in a inky-black line . Scarlet napkins . You ca n't imagine how pretty this was with the black and gold arm chairs and the brilliant turquoise satin . After seeing how striking the effect was I wondered how in the world I had stood those namby-pamby moss roses all that time . We all should get a fresh approach to our own things once in a while , do n't you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all her grandchildren 's pictures . She framed them in small shiny frames , some round , some square , then hung them here and there on a large and interesting old piece of driftwood she had collected , and called it her " family tree . " This made a conversation piece and took care of her " you " touch in the library . Putting a small black rocker in an unexpected place , hanging a green-shaded lamp over the game table , using a terrace chaise with a mad plaid cover in the family room , trying one  | of the small old school desks , painted shiny black as a telephone table ? simple things like that can give your room that " this is mine " look . So many people think of red , blue , green , pink , etc. , when they think of color schemes . Far too few realize how colorful black and white can be when spiced with a brilliant dash of accent color . If you look through your service magazines you will find that in almost every cleverly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It may be a king-sized black and white check for a four-poster bed and curtains . It may be a tablecloth in black and white stripes with napkins of pungent lemon-peel yellow , or a wicker basket , painted shiny black and filled with shocking pink yam for a sweaterin-the-making . Thank goodness , we have embarked on a whole new era where we do n't have to think of what is traditionally correct , but can be as daring and original as an abstract artist . The result is a delightful sense of freedom . So when you grow weary of your rose beige and your pastel blue , do n't forget what black and white can do for any room . Be bold about it ! Try something new ! While driving through the country recently we saw a most inspiring sight . A tall-spired New England church with its frosted white pillars beautifully lit from beams emanating from some hidden source . We stopped to take in the beauty and serenity of this picture . And that started us talking of the magic of lighting . Lighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it . With all the marvelous systems of indirect lighting today , we really should get more drama into our rooms . Too often  | our lighting is too blatant . This dispells the enchantment of good company . Many times , on the other hand , a room is poorly or unevenly lit and we have the urge to brush away the fog-like dimness . The next time you entertain look over your rooms and see if you are missing that magic that effective lighting invites ! It is n't so much what you have that counts , it 's how resourceful you are . If you see some wallpaper that you love but ca n't afford , why not buy one roll and cut it into long strips , to go from a foot under the ceiling to a foot over the sofa ? Frame , say three strips , in 1-inch black molding and you 'll have an eye-stopping conversation piece . Use the leftover paper to cover tired wastebaskets , line bureau drawers , or to cover old books . If you want something different but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why not buy unpainted pieces and paint them white and trim them with turquoise blue or peony pink ? Painted furniture has made a come-back , so why not be " first " in your neighborhood ? Colored mats can do wonders to photographs or old pictures . Or you can repaint your yellowed parchment lamp shades a crisp white or shiny black . It does n't have to be a big thing . A lot of little things can make a big difference in a home . So do n't sit down and wish ? get busy . In the spring everybody longs for a perky pick-up ? a new hat , a patent-leather pocketbook , an oversized boutonniere of purple violets ? some new touch for the house . A good suggestion for the house " pick-up " is to buy matching wallpaper and fabric and see where you can do the most good with the least of each . For instance , paper the wall in back of your bed with wallpaper that is a riot of blooms .  | Then hang a few yards of fabric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **34;1635;TOOLONG cornice covered with the wallpaper . Or paper your kitchen ceiling in a cheerful small print and have cafe curtains on the bottom sash and a ruffle across the top in fabric of the same pattern as your wallpaper . Or paper your bathroom above the tile in one of the enchanting new papers and use the matching fabric as a window curtain and ( with a plastic liner ) as a shower curtain . Try something a little bit different and see how it not only perks up your house , but perks you up too ! Here are a few pepper-uppers that your house might welcome right about now : For springtime all year ' round , try some of the new sheets and pillow cases with tulips marching across the borders in pink , yellow , or blue array . Spot some of the new vivid ceramic bowls around for a note of gaiety in your room . Try a yarn painting , just for fun and color , to hang over the fireplace . Hang some wind chimes near your back door so that their merry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own boy comes breezing in . Experiment with paper bathmats . Investigate the new contoured hassocks in lipstick red , chocolate brown , black , turquoise , etc. , for in front of a sectional sofa . Add a few Oriental tidbits like a Palace lantern , wall scrolls , a grass matting area rug or a screen for the wall in back of the sofa . Change the old wooden legs on your coffee table to some cast metal legs finished in antique brass which will add a light note to your room . To highlight a wall , try a couple of outsize solid brass butterflies . Why not get a nest of unpainted tables and lacquer them a Chinese red or mandarin yellow ?  | Whatever you do , inject your house with a fresh new spirit . Even a small dose of " tonic " can work wonders ! Many of us could well take a lesson or two from the Japanese . To them too much of anything is a sin . Their houses may seem bare to us but they have a crisp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And look at their flower arrangements ( not that I approve of such set patterns ) . They are economical in their use of a few flowers and do best where they have the least to arrange . We are so apt to try to pile too much in one room . This is especially true of people who collect antiques . A room to be restful must have some basic plan for the furniture . And just because a piece is valuable does n't mean you have to try to fit it into your already overcrowded space . Take a firm stand when Aunt Mary insists on your taking her mahogany highboy which will stand out like a black blister with your polished blond modern set . Look around the room you are in right now . Does it look restfully spacious , or are you a clutter bug ? How does your terrace , patio , or strip of backyard look ? Are you making the most of it ? One terrace I will never forget . It was in Monte Carlo on top of an apartment house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its yachts and motor launches lazily bobbing up and down on the blue water . An awning as blue as the Mediterranean itself , with a flirty white fringe covered the terrace . Huge white tubs of brilliant blue hydrangea outlined the edge of the terrace and the whitest of white furniture sported the gayest of shocking-pink cushions , on seat and back .  | If we all ca n't have a ballastrade and a harbor of bobbing boats , at least we can rip off those faded old blue cushions , get out the paint pot , use a little imagination and create a corner that will make a gay summer ! It was the Duchess in Alice in Wonderland who said , " Off with their heads ! " Today many furniture designers , going to the other extreme , are saying , " Off with their feet . " They are referring to pieces of furniture , of course , which they hang on the walls . It 's an exciting new way of making your walls work for you . From a single shelf to an entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make use of a wall and have less feet on the floor to dust under or around . Desks , bookshelves , record-players , bars , televisions , glass-fronted cabinets may be suspended from the wall , and they even have units that can turn corners . Imagine what a space saver these can be ! This type of furniture is sold in sections so that you can make up your own combinations . It 's a wonderful idea to give an old-hat room a modern new look . Do investigate , especially if you 're the " So , what 's new ? " type ! It does n't take a pink wall or an orange wall-to-wall carpet or a sofa covered in red to bring color into a room . In other words , you do n't need great masses of color to have a room look alive and inviting . Bright colors in small doses can be a magically potent tonic to any room . Visit a china or glass department and see what can be done with the exquisite ( and not expensive ) glassware in bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the new china , in mouth-watering colors or in chic black or white . Spot a few pieces around and see how  | these color exclamation points can help punctuate the everyday look of your room . Have you seen the new color idea for tables ? Runners in juicy fresh colors . These go down the length of your table ( on either side ) and give a more unbroken line of color than place mats . Try something daring in a small way to bring a big new color lift into your life . A recent " ad " for imaginative packaging had the title , " Ingenuity never ends here ! " I hope the same stamp could be put on your house . We have repeated like a parrot over and over " it is n't the amount of money you have to spend , it 's the amount of ingenuity you are endowed with or learn to use that makes your house the special place it is !

Or it might be using an effective wall dada in the dining room . Last summer someone spread an extra large beach towel trimmed with fat tassels as a terrace tablecloth ? that was ingenuity ! Tossed into the washing machine it could serve at the beach the next day . One of those semi-circular floor mats that says " Welcome " and comes in either lively black and red designs or ruddy beiges makes an unusual and fun make-believe headboard for a bed when tacked to the wall at the pillow end . Let the motto for your own home be " Ingenuity never ends here ! " Because we have heard it so often , I am sure everybody must recognize the words " Does she or does n't she ? "  | The original question had to do with does she or does n't she tint her hair . But the words can be used in connection with practically anything . For instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she or does n't she " know how to make a house look like a home ? Does she have that knack of creating a warm and welcome hall or foyer ? Does n't she know that a small bouquet on the hall table , a friendly light , a few good pictures , an interesting chair or bench and a gay rug on the floor make a visitor happy to be admitted into the charm of the rest of the house ? Does she arrange the furniture in good talking groups so that you do n't need an amplifier to try to hear what the rest of the people in your group are saying ? Does n't she know that people will smoke , so why play hide and seek with the ash trays . Why does n't she have plenty of good-sized ones on a table handy to each chair or sofa ? You can play this " Does she or does n't she " game , but just be sure you 're on the winning end ! Are you a **33;1671;TOOLONG type ? Are you a **25;1706;TOOLONG character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after year ? Just how versatile is your taste ? I heard of someone the other day whose house is filled with roses . That sounds pleasant , does n't it , when you first hear about it ? But when you get slipcovers , draperies , bedspreads , rugs , and china all dripping with roses , it becomes a pretty monotonous garden to have to live with . She should make a grand switch to crisp plaids , stripes , or polka dots . If you 've always been the chintzy type , why not try some gay vibrant plain colors ? And if you 've always subscribed to the Plain Jane theory when it came to draperies or slipcovers ,  | why not give your room a dashing new look with one of the over-sized florals being shown today ? If your twin love seats are beginning to show their age , try one of the new sectionals in early American , modern , or provincial design . Do n't be " too set in your ways " ! In other words , be versatile ! That well-worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be applied to a sentence I came across the other day . " One uncommon burst of color can transform the commonplace . " Oftentimes a room that might otherwise be crossed off as rather ordinary rates a second glance because of some " uncommon burst of color . " It may be just the use of a sofa pillow in an unexpected watermelon pink or purple iris or a picture mat of Bristol blue . Or it might be a row of bottles flashing their amethyst , topaz , or emerald jewels in a sunny window . A splash of blueberry blue used in a room with light wood tones , a chair in lemon-peel yellow , a brilliant painting that stirs a room to life , a cluster of scarlet poppies ? it does n't have to be a big thing . You might try a vivid mandarin orange to-the-floor felt tablecloth for a round table or hang a white bird cage with a canary-yellow parakeet against a wall done in expresso black . A small unimpressive room can lose the " un " any time if it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white checked chairs and some peppery touches of scarlet in an ottoman or perhaps the lining of a bookcase . Look around your own little hacienda . What can you do with that " uncommon burst of color that transforms the com-monplace " ?  | On a trip through one of New York 's large stores I jotted down these notes for you : Saw one room with deep blue walls , blue and white rug , and all furniture in gold and white . ( Lovely ! ) . . . . Over a corner dressing table , a circular curtain rod with an embroidered 8-inch ruffle which joined up with two windows on either side , using the same embroidered motif for curtains . ( Good idea for a little girl 's room ) . . . . Three separate square coffee tables instead of one long one in front of a sofa . ( More and more I like this idea . Makes such easy access to the sofa . ) . . . . Be a " nature sculptor " and use real nuts , cones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall . ( Wonderful and simple way to display your creative urge . ) .... If you can have only one room for a boy and girl , divide the room with nests of shelves ? a desk for Him and a dressing table unit for Her . ( Seemed most adequate . ) . . . . If you do n't care for the view from your window , have window shades with a scene painted on them . ( Looked most effective used with cornice-and-curtain on brass rings . ) . . . . One wall of a room in Bristol blue , three in white , and the furniture all in blue and green . ( Looking for something different ? Try this ! ) But do make your own list and experiment ! Teen-agers not only dictate the furnishings in their own room , but wield a strong influence on what goes into the rest of the house . And this is good ! They inject a youthful vigor that is most refreshing ! One of the large stores even has opened two home furnishing shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stuffed animals , bulletin boards , record players , lamps , perfume bottles , rugs , closet and desk accessories , mirrors , bedspreads , place mats , blankets and pictures . The big trend seems to be " how to transform a bedroom  | into a combination room for studying , sleeping , and entertaining fellow teens . " A wall-to-wall desk that can serve as work table as well is a good suggestion . It offers drawer storage space and if placed under a series of windows not only utilizes usual dead space but offers good light . A trundle bed or bunk bed is a space saver and can be made up attractively with a tailored cover . A hanging lamp over the bed , perforated cardboard wall for their personal scrapbook items , a juicy colored rug on the floor , and some special-interest paintings on the wall stamp the room as definitely " His " or " Hers . " Might as well face it , it 's Teen Time ! Let 's see what we can find that could add a little dash without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or bedroom , an ivy sconce , a wrought-iron beauty of gold-tinted white ivy leaves , and tiny blossoms artfully set between two pretty candle holders . Or a real jewel basket or hand-cut and hand-polished crystals in a compactly beautiful chandelier guaranteed to add a special sparkle wherever it is hung . Or how about a colorful umbrella stand , say one with a Victorian floral pattern on a white background or a white geometric design on deep blue ? And no matter how modern a home may be , there 's usually a closet or powder room that calls for a light cord . Have you ever seen one that had over three dozen tiny rose buds clustered together to form a 2-inch ball , heading an elegant end tassel ? I bet not , but there is such a thing ! For the wicker department , try an ice bucket in a rattan basket , or as a kitchen pick-up , handwoven wicker baskets set with liners and airtight lids for flour , sugar , coffee , and tea . Or how about a handy hand-carved little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ash tray . Think up some " lots of dash for little cash " ideas for your house ! Remember that old nursery question " When is a door not a door ? " Well doors , or shapes that started out to be doors , seem destined today to serve in all sorts of interesting capacities , not at all door-like ! A recent magazine gave such clever uses of doors I thought it might prick your own ingenuity into doing an a-dooring job in some corner of your house . One idea was a storage wall at the end of a room . Two doors led into closets . The center door was stationary and held an aquarium which could be reached from either closet . Paintings , three to a door , would make this a decorative addition to any room . Then they showed three louvred doors ? one used as a head panel for a bed . One was fastened to the floor as a foot panel . And the third was used as a canopy joining the tall foot and head panel . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old building to make a room divider ? use two doors laid lengthwise for each side . Leave enough room to insert planter at top of doors . Cover the open end with a board ? and paint . Another idea was to use three paneled doors as a wall in back of a sofa . Painting the molding on the doors in a color to go with the room created a startling color accent . Three paneled doors hinged together was used as an interesting folding screen . Gay prints added the needed touch . Any old unused doors around your neighborhood ? Why not experiment ? Remember that old Cole Porter song , " Night and day , you are the one . " Well , you are the one when it comes  | to remembering that when you decorate a room you have to think how it 's going to look in the light of day and by lamplight . How many times have I heard , " Sorry you are seeing this room in the daylight . It looks much better at night with the lights on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a window and see what happens to the colors in the sunlight or the natural light of day . Then try it under an artificial light ( not a fluorescent ) and if it 's a print , notice whether the colors fade away into a blur of unattractive uninteresting hues . If it 's a plain fabric it may look like a completely different color when exposed to artificial light . With fabrics , lamp shades , accessories , and in the choice of light or dark furniture , think in terms of night and day . You 'll find your rooms will have a more alive look in sunlight and shade , and just to remind yourself , the next time you go shopping start humming " Night and Day . " When we were children we used to play a game called " Heavy , heavy hangs over your head . " Today the heavy , heavy over your head is very likely to be a hanging lamp . But there 's one warning that should go with this hanging lamp fever . Do n't have too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a cave full of stalactites . One or even two in the right spot can enhance a room , it 's true , but the other day I saw a picture and all you were aware of were the ups and downs of all the hanging lamps . It completely destroyed the harmony of the rest of the room and gave it a restless , jumpy look . There was a cluster of those basket types drooping over a big chair . Then two large white cylindrical shapes hovered over the sofa with a third good-looking-by-itself model shining on a round table and  | four chairs , while a fourth member of the hanging clan in the hall was visible from the living room . I have seen the hanging , pull-down lamps used successfully over twin beds , one for each bed , and chosen with taste , it looked attractive and practical . Over a dining table in the family room seems an excellent place for a hanging lamp , and a hallway or foyer shows off a hanging lamp to good advantage . But do n't overdo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ globes may be fine for one room but in another type of room it may look as overpowering as the snowcapped Alps , so know your lamp limits , and then " go hang " ! We had our own private poll as to what men like around the house . And we found that : A man likes big ash trays , ones that will hold a cigarette if he wants to lay it down and still have room for ashes ... . He likes a good-sized coffee table , not so filled with do-dads that there is n't room if he wants to put his feet up . . . . He prefers stripes and plaids and checks to flowers for slipcovers but would go along with what his wife picks out ... . He does n't mind ruffles on a curtain but draws the line at a beruffled bedspread . . . . He thinks every man should be allowed one comfortable chair and he does n't see why you ca n't find a good-looking one and let him enjoy it ( we do n't either ! ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk of his own , either in his bedroom or anywhere it would fit in . . . . Most men do not like lavender or purple . . . . Quite a number thought they could do a better job than their wives at choosing lamps . " They get them for looks and not for reading .... " The choice seemed to be pretty equally divided between wall-to-wall carpeting and bare floor with area rugs . . . Every man seemed to want a little corner he could call his  | own , no matter how small . . . . The majority liked a real dining room ... . There you are , ladies ! If you want to please your man , find out if he agrees . Why not take your own family poll before you decorate ? In my opinion there is nothing more tempting , winter or summer , than a mixed green salad . The different shades from the almost yellow folded inner leaf of endive to the deep green of fresh basil make an inviting palette of greenery . Now , suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and we have the all-green room with just a painting in tangerine and yellow , a bouquet of white flowers , or an ornamental box of Chinese red to break up these new " green pastures . " It 's as refreshing as a bed of pungent mint and so easy to live with after the orchids and reds of yesterday . Think of a room done all in wintergreen , citrus green , Empire green , green olive , and bronze green with white accessories . What a background for guests in dresses of lemon-peel yellow , tangerine , or peacock blue ! Or if you do n't quite " go for " the all-green look , you 'll . find that green is a good mixer . Nature uses it as a background for a sky of blue with white clouds , for soft gray pussywillows , flaming scarlet roses , tangy orange nasturiums , snowwhite chrysanthemums , and purple iris . Just look around you for an inspiration as to what to pair up with the new greens . And do n't be afraid to try something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brides ( besides " Be happy ! " ) is when you 're planning the furniture for your new home , do n't leave out a desk . Everybody thinks of a sofa , chairs , end tables , coffee ta- bles , beds , chests , and rugs , but so many " forget to remember " what a desk can do for a room . It may be a large desk with workmanlike drawers if you have the room , and that is the kind you need , or it may be a feminine French version in white for your bedroom corner . Sturdy early American pine or delicate sheraton mahogany ? it does n't matter what shape or wood your desk may be , just as long as it is on good terms with the rest of your furniture . Whether the drawers have porcelain pulls , wooden knobs , or glistening brass hardware is up to you . There 's a desk for every kind of room you could devise . If your taste runs toward the Far East , for instance , you can even find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides the original touch to a room and the practical values of having a definite place to write notes , checks , etc. , it makes a good excuse for an extra chair , and a fine nesting place for an attractive lamp and the telephone . Whereas Macbeth cried , " Hang out our banners on the outward wall , " today 's decorators seem to be reversing the order and concentrating on the " inward " walls . What with panels , draperies , fabrics , glasses , and storage groups , a wall is no longer just a side of a room , it must act as a functional decorative ally as well . Recently I saw a room with one whole wall done in panels of vibrant blues , greens , and purples . Each panel , when opened up , served as storage space . Lush-looking draperies across one wall proved not to shroud a window , but to disguise rows of shelves holding all kinds of paraphernalia you never know where to hide . An impressive painting may turn out to conceal a receded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than meets the eye !  | But it 's a practical legerdemain and helps preserve today 's uncluttered look . Bamboo-patterned wallpaper can create a trellised effect and lend a wall a textured outdoor look . Just the background for a cozy table and two chairs . And do n't overlook what you can do with a series of ceramic tiles . You can " paint " your own mosaic into a handsome wall decoration by your selection of tiles . And one clever home-maker framed a row of elegant place mats for her dining room wall , and it could n't have been more strikingly original . So , look around your walls and " hang out your own personal banners , " but do it now ! About the only pole we used to hear anything about was either the North Pole or the South Pole . Not so today ! North , south , east , or west , we seem to be living in a Pole Age . In practically every house , whether it 's colonial or splitlevel , you 're very apt to find one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use . Two poles may be holding up a ladder of smartly fringed bath towels in the bathroom , or a pole may be a nesting place for three practical lights that can be turned at any angle to suit the individual 's need . Or it might accommodate potted plants clipped to its shining metal surface . Either brass or chrome finished poles may hold up an ingenious " Shelfmaker " over the toilet seat . This has towel space , places to hang wash cloths , and a sliding-door cabinet for bottles and jars at the top . Have you seen the new vanity pole that has a hamper , three roomy shelves on one side , and a full mirror on the other ? It 's in a fruitwood finish with sparkling white interiors and as practical an addition to a bedroom , bathroom , children 's room , or dressing room as you could find anywhere .  | Sparkling brass poles often serve as vertical room dividers with small chests placed in between for extra storage . The big advantage of this pole craze is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marks or requiring the aid of a carpenter . Why not become a member of the " pole " parade ? Join today ! This is the time for " stepping out " on fur ! It used to be quite a thing back in the days of the early movies and now that furry wave of luxury seems to be returning . Of course , if we ca n't all afford the " real thing " there are any number of you-have-to-feel-to-know fake reproductions that can do a lot for a room . The family room sofa , for instance , covered in make-believe leopard can inspire a virile , safari look and give you a good excuse for the new browns , with a fake-zebra mat . A massive sofa pillow in the makebelieve pattern of one of the fur-bearing animals can take any sofa out of the ordinary and into home fashion news . Throw rugs could be edged with a gay felt , but do n't stop there , have a matching " throw " of the material tossed onto the bunk in the den , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy from the animal kingdom . Cover a folding screen in fur fabric to give emphasis to a forgotten corner , or use it as a room divider or to hide a hobby 's paraphernalia , like photographic equipment . Turn into a hunter this winter and see if you ca n't trap some of these " fur-out " ideas for your own home ! Have you noticed lately there seems to be a big emphasis on bathrooms ? And anybody who does n't take advan- tage of all the things on sale to do away with the drabness of the utility pieces deserves to be bored with last year 's tired look of her bathroom . Mr. Burpee in his wildest dreams could never produce such an array of blossoms as you can find in bath towels , mats , and shower curtains . And even if you ca n't afford to change your paint job , if it 's a neutral one , you can splash a new color from tip to toe and have your bathroom looking as refreshed as a lilac after a gentle rain . Mix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with white scattered with tangerine flowers . Mix lemon-peel yellow with spicey brown and Empire green . Try out the new green and the new blue palette in varying shades . Paint an old hamper and wastebasket in one of the glowing towel colors . Get your do-it-yourself husband ( or his handy friend ) to whip up a two-framed hinged towel ladder with five rungs each . Use in a corner like a screen , and when it is hung with a riot of glamorous towels it will be as good as a rainbow on a dark day . Fill a pretty emerald , amethyst , cranberry , or amber decanter full of bath oil , or try one of the new Bristol blue ash trays as a soap dish . Make a terry-cloth curtain and edge it with a whopping big contrasting fringe . Do something ! Do anything ! But do n't just let your bathroom sit there crying for a magic touch of color ! It 's always exciting to me to see imagination at work ! And the other night I visited an artist friend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three cheers for what he had done to a dark-hole-of-Calcutta kitchendining area . First , he had painted the whole space a spanking white .  | Then in the dining place he had painted slim birch-type trees , up the side of the walls , with branches and fragile leaves life-like on the ceiling . The colors were a soft gray and a gentle silver-green with touches of black . Then he had added tiny Japanese lanterns in black and white . These were in irregular heights in groups of threes , and looked as if they were hanging from the branches . He had fastened them to the ceiling with a stapling gun . ( They 're paper-light , you know . ) Wired with tiny Christmas tree lights , they were unbelievably effective . For his one window , he had found a black and white striped cafe curtain and an all white cafe curtain . These he used in an unusual alternate way . On the top was one white and one black and white striped curtain , and the reverse on the bottom . It looked as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sure the ancient Persian rug makers must be gnashing their teeth in some Oriental utopia or wherever their departed spirits dwell . Never have rugs and carpets been so rich in color and design as they are today ! Loop textures , sheared pile , tufted weaves of Acrilan and modacrylic , cut-pile cotton , twist wool pile , nylon , orlon , and so on ? and what patterns and colors ! Plaids , polka dots , plain . No longer is it necessary to have rugs custom made ? dream of it and you 'll find it waiting for you in colors that outdo the jewels of a maharajah . With all this , how can people be satisfied with a dreary gray or tan rug ? " Because they go with everything , " you say . Nonsense ! It 's easier to plan a room around a scarlet or emerald-green rug than it is around a gummy gray . You 're defeated before you start . Wake up to the rainbow in the carpet sky ! Try one of the  | luscious new colors like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come alive ? and so will you ! You have often heard that old saying , " A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush . " Well , I think a bird in a cage is worth more than one in the hand . If you live in an apartment and ca n't have a cat or dog , the next best thing is to have a bird . ( And some people would much rather . ) They require little care and are as decorative as a painting . Bird cages , like Victorian bric-a-brac , seem to be having a revival and I 'm all for the idea . The cages may be as ornate as a jeweler 's tray or as simple as a wren 's house . In a model dining room recently I saw a huge wire masterpiece complete with bird , placed on an ornamental low shelf . It looked quite original . A bird cage is a novel idea as a corner filler . And there are so many exciting types , some on tall pedestals , some in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like Oriental temples , and some of the wicker models are particularly handsome in their intricate patterns . Buy a bird to match or contrast with your room 's color scheme and have the fun of owning something that is not only decorative but alive ! With all the wonderful ideas brimming over in the stores , in the magazines and newspapers I do n't see how people ca n't get inspired to do something about their own world of home . When I mentioned this to someone the other day she said , " Oh of course , those ideas are wonderful but they 're way beyond me . " This is a silly attitude to take . Granted , some of the things that appeal to us may be way beyond our budget , but we always can translate a good idea into some- thing we can afford if we have the will to do it . Instead of that tufted satin spread , I 'd settle for a crisp chintz any day . For those fabric-hung walls , there are wallpapers just as effective , for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go with it . You have to be a translator . Translate what you see into what you can afford , using your own ingenuity to make it yours . Start translating today ! Have you heard of the Congress on Better Living ? I had n't either until I happened to turn on the television some time ago and there were a group of women discussing houses and what should go into them . My ears immediately pricked up when the moderator asked this group of carefully selected housewives what they wanted in their house of today . Guess what they wanted most ? a fireplace ! The second " want " was storage space . The moderator expressed surprise that a dishwasher or washing machine had n't won first place . I was surprised too but so delighted . As you know by now , a fireplace , with its friendly crackle and cheery flames , is a " must " to me when I think of home . There is nothing , to my mind , that can make a room come alive like a good fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflected warmth in those who share it . So when you plan that new house , skimp on something else , but be like the ladies on the panel of the Congress on Better Living and vote for a fireplace first ! Every once in a while I find myself taking a stand against something that many experts seem to agree on . I 've not only heard an art editor lecture on the subject , but the other day a famous designer-decorator made the statment  | that " if you ca n't have an original painting , do n't have a reproduction , substitute a bouquet of fresh flowers . " Now I 'm all for fresh flowers , but I disagree with the other part . Of course , we all would love to own an original Cezanne , Klee , Monet , etc. , but who can afford these today ? and pay the grocer ? Is n't it better to have a good reproduction of a famous work than never to be able to enjoy art in your home ? Some of the reproductions are so good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple frame , the painting becomes a pleasant nucleus for other works of art . I am all for getting the best there is out of life , but if that is impossible , why not settle for second best on the premise that , in the case of painting , a good painting should make a good reproduction , and why not enjoy it ? There are all kinds of international problems today , but what to do with French doors seems to head the list . There are any number of solutions , depending on where your French door is , how the windows of that room are " dressed , " etc. ? bamboo or match-stick rollups ; vertical blind strips ; see-through curtains rod-fastened at top and bottom ; tie-back frilly ruffled curtains ; plain , printed , or plaid cafes ; ruffled top , cafe curtain bottom ; an 8-inch ruffle tacked all around the edge of the frame , have the hem facing in toward the center of the glass . Or if you do n't need the light and want to disguise the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your walls . Another idea is to paste parchment paper over the panes transforming the door into a modern shoji screen effect . If none of these solve your French door problem , consult your carpenter and get a new solid door .  | I love new ideas and it 's always exciting to see them put to use . Have you noticed those new fold-away dining tables ? I think they are the perfect answer for space savers . One I saw looked like a shoji screen in a decorative frame when the table was folded up against the wall . The shoji screen was the underpart of the table , and when not in use , legs folded up and the whole thing disappeared like magic back into its frame . When the table was in use , lo and behold , there was a full-sized mirror in the frame , seeming to enlarge the dining area . Another had a beautiful Oriental scene in the underneath part so that when the table was folded back , you saw nothing but a lovely painting serene in its frame . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card table ? It not only solves the problem of how to have sit-down meals in a limited space but is a decorative asset as well . If you did n't want to go to the expense of the painting , a wallpaper panel with an Oriental scene would serve admirably . Or , if you are anti-Oriental painting , choose a subject to your taste . A do-it-yourself husband could figure this out and no doubt add his own original touches . Are you listening , do-it-yourself husbands ? " East is east and west is west " and when the two meet it 's liable to mean a backache these days . Translated , that sentence refers to the trend for Oriental seating arrangements in many living rooms , especially of the younger set . As you know I love the new and different , but I also vote for comfort under any conditions . And sitting about 8 inches from the floor for any length of time is a little hard to take , especially if you have long legs . In the first place , it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an American living room into a geisha  | house . A few Oriental touches can be most effective , but when it comes to burning incense and sitting with cramped legs on a just-off-the-floor " pad , " that is carrying things too far . Having spent a rather uncomfortable evening recently ( as you no doubt gathered ) I would advise , for the sake of your visitors , who may not have practiced their yoga exercises lately , do n't fall too far for all this lure of the East . Balance it with a little Western comfort . Please ! Have you been to the jungle lately ? Well no need for that safari now . Have n't you seen the " Love for Leopard " ? It 's playing at all the department stores and if you are in a jungle mood just walk in and view the sign of the leopard everywhere . Bedspreads , pillowcases , terry towels , bath rugs , and shower curtains all look lush and as expensive as a maharajah 's harem . But they are less expensive than you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are used to . I do n't know that I would want to be surrounded with all those spots all the time , but it would be fun for a guest room or as a change . Harmonizing solid-color sheets and blankets help to tone down the spots . I saw a set-up of the leopard items in a room with a background of slate blue . It might be very dramatic in a room with white walls , black rug , and curtains in the tawny orange of the leopard spots . And pots of white flowers everywhere . How do you feel about leopards in the bedroom and bath ? Have you been " room shopping " lately ? This is much more fun than window shopping and usually you can stand  | and look as long as you please without anyone nudging you out of position while trying to get a closer view . Room shopping is done in large stores and means looking at the model rooms which usually are brimming with ideas . Last week I saw an idea which might inspire you to pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one wall ( as many apartments do ) fill in the windows with full white curtains . Then put up four boxy posts , one at each end and one between each window , with a box-like cornice all across the top . Then buy a roll of wallpaper that simulates Delft tiles and paste to each post and on the squared-off cornice . This gives a light and airy effect to the whole wall , and is worth trying . In this room was a black coffee table , a brilliant mustard sofa ( with red pepper pillows ) , and two mustard chairs . With three Delft blue walls and the blue and white tile-like window wall , it was quite a different-looking room . It 's fun to experiment with an idea . Try it with your own interpretation . Whenever we 're tired we think of " bed . " But when you 're tired of bed , what do you do ? I hope you sit right down and think up some daisy-fresh ideas to make it more inviting . I saw such a pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Three walls were yellow . The whole wall in back of the roomy double bed was curtained . Right behind the headboard hung a full yellow-and-white eyelet embroidery curtain . Then , pulled back at the sides with a bumptuous big brass rosette , were yellow curtains to the floor . A white quilted coverlet topped a perky Spanish yellow and white plaid dust ruffle . On the bed was one big pillow in  | a ruffled yellow and white plaid pillow sham . And on either side was tossed a round yellow pillow . An almost white hooked rug with generous squares of blue flowers and green leaves , an azure-blue glass lamp with a white shade and a white Naugahyde chair in front of a desk gave the room a cozy look . There were some kind of medals on green mats and red mats in gold frames on the wall , clustered over the headboard . I have never been particularly partial to yellow , but I must say this looked inviting . Have you ever had a yellow room ? When you place your potted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your whole color scheme . So many real flower lovers fuss with their plants with plantfood and sprays and then arrange them with no relation at all to the rest of the room . Wake up to the fact that red geraniums look blithe and gay on the window sill between your white curtains , or that your potted primrose shows up best on that table near the window where the sun strikes it and makes it glow against the soft blue walls . Plan the best backgrounds , color contrasts , and settings for your plants , both in the daytime and at night . Just because your plants must usually live on the window sills during sunny hours does n't mean that they ca n't be scattered around your room to the best advantage after nightfall . It is n't enough just to love flowers ? you do them an injustice if you do n't make the best possible use of their beauty . The knocker on your front door , the doorknobs throughout your house , and even all the handles and knobs on furniture drawers help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't own your own home you probably wo n't  | want to change the doorknobs all through the house . If this is the case , and they are ugly , paint them the same color as the doors . New , distinguished furniture handles can alter the entire appearance of an old and uninteresting piece . Handles should be big , simple , and shiny . ( Unless , of course , you have an authentic antique with dull gold handles . ) Take a look at your less impressive chests and cabinets and see whether they could n't be completely restyled by new hardware . Any well-known hardware firm will send you a catalog of hardware that will dazzle you with the variety offered . It does n't have to be elaborate or expensive either . The simpler , the better ? size is what counts . And do n't forget it 's the little touches , like knobs and knockers , that are almost as important as the color to paint your living room . I love weather vanes on barns but I never carry one with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sure some people must , they are so concerned with whether it 's a north room , an east room , a south , or west room . Frankly , I do n't pay the slightest bit of attention to directions . I do n't want a gloomy room , no matter what the exposure is . Good common sense would tell you that you would n't be happy in a dark room with dark paper and heavy dusky chintz curtains . Color is pretty in any room , and the old idea of having warm colors in a north room and cool colors in a south room is too confusing to bother with in this day of colors so delectable they should be attractive in an Eskimo igloo or a Bali hut . Do n't worry so much about your room being on the south- east or northwest corner , decorate it the way you want , and repeat after us , " If it looks right , it is right . " Tie-backs are back and it 's giving the windows a new look . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie-backs or the bluish opalescent white ones or be as dainty as a shepherdess with lovely old flowered enameled ones . For the masculine paneled room you can find ( or have made at your lumber yard ) whopping big wooden tie-backs which team up well ( painted or unpainted ) with a lusty horse-blanket plaid curtain . Shiny brass leaves make quite a decorative splash and look particularly elegant paired with sky-blue or emerald-green damask . Cord tie-backs with plump tassels , a piece of gold or silver chain , tie-backs made from interesting antique buttons sewed to a strip of curtain fabric ? you can be as ingenious as you like and do n't let anybody say , " You ca n't use that ! " A whole skein of yarn in turkey red or cowslip yellow makes a homey-looking tie-back for the family room curtain . And for a child 's room there are all sorts of original suggestions : a teddy-bear at either curtain or a small clown seems to do a good job of holding back each side , while Cupids are most appropriate for bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in plain strips or cut in the shape of fruit , leaves , hearts , or flowers , is an easy-to-do curtain holder-back . Even a strip of fringe can be effective . A friend of mine uses fringe to trim her black linen bathroom curtains and adds a piece of fringe as a tie-back . Most effective ! It 's the time of the tieback , so get back to tying up your curtains ! " Do you have a booklet or ideas on knick-knacks that go with the different types of furniture and decor ? "  | Imagine having to worry whether the little ceramic elephant that was sent to you from India by your cousin Carrie would be all right on an early American coffee table ! Imagine caring whether it would be right or not . If you like it , have it around , no matter what ! Or imagine worrying about the period of a certain ash tray and whether to put it next to a particular lamp on a table . You could go mad with such infinitesimal problems . The interesting part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integration of ideas from all all over . If you wish to become a curator of a museum that 's a different story . Everything should be of a definite period and authentic . But who wants to live in a museum seven days a week ? I do n't ! I would say , " Think about using lovely colors , concentrate on making each room as comfortable and attractive as possible , choose accessories that please you and look well and go with the life you lead . But do n't worry about what knickknacks go with what furniture ! " The other day I was startled to read about a new Oriental rug that had gone through some new process where the colors were literally washed out and the effect was , and I quote , " a dirty bronze brown . " The article ended with " the avant garde crowd is mad for it . " Now really ! How avant garde can you get ? Imagine laboring to acquire a " dirty bronze brown " ! A rich chocolate brown , a spicy cinnamon brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown yes , but a dirty bronze brown , no ! Especially when there are really lovely colors in everything today from rugs to accessories . One of the stores showed what they called their " Mediterranean collection , " and the articles were like brilliant little jewels , as they said , " Singing with vibrant color . "  | For instance , there was a satin glass decanter , a ceramic compote , a ceramic casserole , a satin glass candy dish , satin glass brandy snifter , ceramic jar , straw ice bucket , straw hamper , satin glass bud vase , ceramic fruit bowl and ashtray , etc. , and all ( even the straw ) in the juiciest colors of cool blues , lazy greens , hot reds , and flaming oranges you have ever seen . Imagine what these accessories could do as a color pick-up in one of your rooms ? And these items were all priced within our accessory budget , which made them even more desirable . " Dirty bronze brown " had no place on my schedule and I hope it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colorful Mediterranean colors instead ! Someone once laughingly remarked to me , " You 'd probably like to see a rainbow in every room . " No . I love to see a rainbow in the great expanse of a sky where it belongs , but in a room oftentimes a little color goes a long way . A too-many-colors room can be almost as disturbing as one which lacks that important color punch . It 's just a question of color mathematics ? of adding or subtracting ? that does the trick . There are some interesting ideas today that can bring color into your room without changing the slipcovers or draperies . For instance , I have just been drooling over some beautiful hand-decorated ceramics from Portugal ? an ashtray in the shape of a giant strawberry , a soup tureen disguised as a dew-touched green and white cauliflower , a condiment bowl resembling a ripe tomato on a green leaf , to say nothing of a brilliant yellow mustard or jam dispenser in the shape of a luscious lemon on a crisp-looking ceramic leaf . A ceramic chicken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or book jackets in a heavenly delphinium blue , with dish towels  | in the same hue , can make an all-white kitchen as happy as a bluebird . There 's nothing like a merry wallpaper border in a child 's room to add a note of gaiety at very little expense . Painting the doors or the ceiling a bright color rescues a room from the glooms with no strain on the budget . No one wants a rainbow in every room , but it is cheerful to be greeted with a little look-alive color ! Are you listening ? If you 're far from the sea but long for the feeling of sailing ships and blue water I have a suggestion for you . A friend of mine has just turned an unused attic storeroom into the most charming suite . A clever carpenter put in a goodsized picture window on one end . A stunning scenic wallpaper was chosen for the side walls , a peaceful old colonial harbor with sailing vessels moored to the docks . The sky is a radiant blue , the water a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses are brick . You feel right at the water 's edge ! A wide shelf below the picture window holds pots of red tulips ( raised from bulbs in her sunny window ) . Try this scenic effect on one wall of your dining room . It 's cheaper than taking a trip ! Did you ever hear of a room being built around a set of china ? I had a friend who was willed a set of china , a sort of luminous , moonlit white . The plates were square and the knobs on the vegetable dishes were little bunches of fruit . Around this china , my friend planned a room with white walls , white Ventian blinds , white painted chairs and serving table . But she painted the dining table itself real lacquer red . And over the serving table she hung her only other treasure , a big Persian plate just the blue of the sea on a summer day . Look over your possessions and the next time you want a  | decorating theme , dream up one from your Ming vase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolling hills is a little white New England farmhouse . The young couple who are renting it asked my advice about colors . It is painted white inside and out , from tip to toe , and what could be more delightful than to see a freshly painted crisp white house waiting for the magic touch of color ! White is a wonderful background for color emphasis . I suggested shiny black floors with enough rugs to make the black practical and effective ( either washable large black and white squares or a colorful rug in modern design ) , a big sofa of cerulean blue , two armchairs of the same color , and small chairs in lemon-peel yellow . Would all this go with inherited mahogany furinture ? Of course , all lovely things go together . " You must have brass andirons and fender and crisp white cafe curtains , " and the young people agreed ! If your windows are too narrow , make a note now that when you select your curtains , they should be hung outside the window trim , so that most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass . They will immediately look wider . Teetering , stork-legged tables make any room seem so full of legs it looks as if it might run away at any moment . Any tables with such runaway legs will be immensely improved if you cut them down to the height of your sofa and tables . When you 're out shopping never be afraid to ask for a snip of this or a snip of that . If you see a color that arrests your attention take a sample home with you . It does n't matter  | whether it is burlap or felt , bath toweling or bed ticking , satin or velvet ? it 's the color that matters . I saw this description of a mirror the other day , and it makes you think that a mirror should be more than just a " looking glass , " as Alice in Wonderland calls it . A mirror " performs a function in your designs as nothing else does . It helps you add touches of subtlety for elegance , or work wonders by magnifying space or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make you think you should give the selection of your mirrors a bit more attention ? And we ought to think a little more about the placement of mirrors too . Do n't just hang a mirror ! Stop and figure out where it may be used to the room 's best advantage . Does it reflect something interesting or pleasant enough to bear repeating ? I once saw a collection of small mirrors in original-looking frames massed over a console in a foyer and it made a most delightful and unusual pattern on the wall . Think of original ways to use a mirror , and see that it reflects the happy areas of your house ! Have you ever felt that your rooms looked almost perfect but seemed to lack something ? Perhaps it was a gleam of copper or brass . It takes different textures to make an interesting room , and sometimes just the right placement of a copper or brass object can do the trick . The skillets of solid copper hanging from a solid brass rack or copper-bottomed stainless steel utensils can bring a gleam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a picture of their own when the candlelight is reflected in their broad bases . And brass or copper coal scuttles and andirons take on new interest when  | the fire is crackling and decorating them with dappled flame reflections . Try a brass vase or urn with fresh green lemon leaves to lend a touch of elegance to a coffee table or wide window sill . Brass or copper lamp bases contribute their own special brand of " shine " and are a pleasant change from the white , black , or green common garden varieties . Brass wall sconces , book ends , brass pulls on bedroom chests ? wherever you can think of ? sprinkle a spot of brass or copper and watch it glow . You 'll be cheered with the pick-up results . Try it and see ! Ideas anyone ? For a boy 's room or a vacation cabin there is a new line called " Country Contemporary " which is as rugged as the Rocky Mountains . Made of sturdy elm it is something new and different in the furniture field . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black or gold for over Junior 's bed ... . Shutters make good-looking headboards , left natural or painted white or the color of your bedspread . . . . Do n't forget a good-sized barometer when you are looking for something unusual as a wall hanging . It 's a practical storm warner too . . . . How to get that country look ? just acid a bench , shutters , black and white check , donging clocks , baskets , and braided rugs . . . . If you are the do-it-yourself type , experiment with decorative tile around your stove or sink . It 's fun to collect them . . . . Serve hot soup in mugs for an informal party . They look gay and come in such marvelous colors . . . . A spice shelf is a practical addition to any kitchen . . . . Although I usually do n't care for gold , I have just seen a room done in Empire gold , Empire gold accent , and regal blue ( very dark ) which was quite charming . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want of an idea !  | If your house does n't seem to be responding to all of your efforts , why not give it a " trimmin ' " ? Sometimes just a tiny touch here or there can make all the difference in the world . A floral or woven tape border added to a fabric cornice and running down the edge of a curtain can give a plain drapery that desired custom-made look . A just run-of-the-mill lampshade becomes an eye-catcher by adding contrasting ball fringe or a layer of plump moss fringe to top and bottom of the shade . Inexpensive place mats assume company status with the addition of a strip of bright-colored embroidered tape or an initial or fruit motif cut out of felt . If your area rug does n't extend quite as far as you had pictured it , add a border of harmonizing needlepoint fabric or other good-wearing pattern that you can buy by the yard . Some fabrics lend themselves to borders . Some have medallions , scrolls , motifs that can be cut into strips and used to decorate or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a smart way to lengthen a slipcover that does n't seem to touch the floor as it did before you washed it . A Greek-key border brings a classical relief to a room when used to top a plain wallpapered wall ? or pasted near the rim of a wastebasket . Or around an unadorned mirror it adds an uncomplicated pattern and dresses up an otherwise notworthy-of-notice accessory . Why not give your house the " trimmin ' " it deserves ! Remember that old adage , " Waste not , want not " ? Well , if you 've been wasting space and wanting more , now is the time to do something about it . Although we 're living in a compact age , you 'd be surprised if you stop and make a survey of your own premises how  | many corners you could fill . Take the bathroom , for instance , look at that empty space on either side of the door . Just the spot for two slender linen closets . Or you have enough room for a make-up shelf and mirror to fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not earning its keep . A trundle bed to slide under your teen-ager 's dream spot offers a quick two-bed solution for a one-bed room . And all that space between your beds and the window could be utilized with shelves for books , radio , etc. , with blanket storage in the cabinets underneath . Instead of just an ornate table in the foyer or hall , why not a small chest to hold cards , pads , or whatever you ca n't find a home for anywhere else ? And the hall 's a good place for decorative shelves to house some of your collections . Be a space-saver ! You 'll be amazed at how practical the idea is ? and when you paint your inspiration to match or contrast with your color scheme , you 'll find it a decorative implement as well ! How many times have we warned , " Be sure to see a large enough sample before you decide on fabric or wallpaper " ? What looks good in a small swatch may take on a completely different hue in a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the same fate . An acquaintance of mine bought a new wing chair . She did n't care for the large pattern that came with the chair so went through a great pile of sample swatches and finally chose a tiny red , white , and black plaid . Of course , this was an extra charge . Six weeks later when the chair and ottoman were delivered and she removed the sturdy brown wrapping , she was horrified to see that her gay little red , black , and white plaid had fused into a hot-looking old rose , a color she detested with all  | her heart . It was during a terrific hot spell and she could n't stand to face that uninvited " rose , " so she threw a fresh white sheet over the whole business . When her husband came home to see the new chair he said , " Well , where is it ? " Then she told him the story . Being a sympathetic soul , the husband said diplomatically , " Well , it will look nice and cozy this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brand-new chair and a covering that she ca n't stand and ca n't afford to change . Whether it 's wallpaper or fabric you must insist on seeing at least a yard ( or larger piece , if possible ) of your choice . As the above example shows , the black , white , and red were perfectly distinguishable in the small 5-inch swatch , but in the larger piece ? old rose ! Let that be a lesson to you ! No matter if you 've never put thread to needle before it 's time for you to get on the " embroidery for decoration " band wagon . Just buy some burlap , slubbed linen , a rag rug in a plain color , some heavy rug yarns , knitting wool , fish line , braids , or rickrack , and let your imagination do the rest ! Even if you cringe at the thought of being asked to draw a simple daisy , get your child to create a design with textile paint on a gay burlap background and then you outline the work of art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several for your kitchen , the family room , bedroom ? anywhere ! With a molding frame around them they are worthy competition to a Van Gogh or a Picasso . A big gray elephant ( you can be as abstract as you like , so do n't say , " Who can draw an elephant ? " ) with a brilliant many-colored circus ball at his feet would intrigue any child and create a new look for the wall over the toy chest . A slice of juicy red watermelon with its jet black seeds  | would make an interesting dining room wall panel . ( Make it big ! ) Or even one tall-stemmed rose and a bud would be bound to make a simple and decorative addition to your ordinary stock of pictures . Remember you do n't have to be an artist or a seamstress ? the more amateurish , the better . But do n't be dainty , either in design or stitches . It 's fun ! It 's new ! So do it ! Since many women inquire about accessories and what to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here are some suggestions : Hand-hooked chair pads in striking color combinations . Colonial milk stools , perfect as a fireside seat . A bookcase desk with bookshelves on one side and an old-fashioned desk on the other . A glass-doored gun cabinet . Rugged cocktail tables of solid pine . A galleried headboard for your bed with turned spindles of solid maple . Rocking chairs of all descriptions , imaginatively decorated . Old-time sap buckets that make good magazine holders . An old wall telephone that turns out to be a radio . You turn the crank to select your station . A drum-style wastebasket that may be used as a planter or knitting basket . Huge brass locks and keys . A solid maple serving cart . Louvered door record cabinet . Solid copper Dutch teakettle . A forty-eight by forty-inch hanging tapestry with maple ferrules ( American eagle motif over an early-colony map ) . Long braided oval rugs for halls . Spice racks and a hand-blown , Pilgrim weather glass . Does n't this give you an idea of how to spice a room with early Americana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were just " there " on the floor ? a stretch of colorless nubs , usually , that were supposed to be practical and  | last a lifetime . They added nothing to a room and half the time everybody forgot that they were part of the decoration of a room . How times have changed ! Today there 's a terrific emphasis on rugs and what you do with them . The area rugs have developed into such beauties of color and design they are being used on the walls and as upholstery fabric for banquettes , ottomans , and comfortable chairs . The effect is quite luxuriously unusual . In a pine-paneled kitchen over a Deacon 's bench recently I saw what looked like an entrancing farm scene . It turned out to be a small rectangular hooked rug , complete with red barn , black cows , green trees , and a rail fence . Too pretty for footprints , fine for " eyes . " You can upholster a headboard with a rug in a mass of brilliant flowers for an everlasting flower bed over your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a two-by-four frame for a room divider . Think about a rug when you need to add a new look to your room . And do n't settle for anything ordinary ! Spain is a wonderful country and I love Spanish things , but let 's not go overboard with this new Spanish invasion and create a lopsided house with those heavy Spanish imports . Suddenly the market is sated with chests with heavy carved doors , iron based tables , Spanish chairs with the X bases , carved cabinets galore , and , of course , the exuberantly colored rugs and bedspreads . Like chili powder or English mustard , a little goes a long way . Used as a flavoring , the Spanish influence can be attractively exciting . One of the chests might serve as a record cabinet . A Spanish chair could add a little zip to a desk in the family room . A hand-knotted Spanish rug in a combina- tion of their hot and rich deep colors might be used as a wall decoration or to prick a little life in a rather drab room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new color scheme for a room you have been wondering about , and your collegiate offspring has no doubt already purchased one of the new Spanish bedspreads for her dormitory room ? or suggested that you do so for the house . But this is not all . Ash trays , candlesticks , mirrors , shower curtains , and towels have all been put under the spell of Spain . It 's catching . And a little of it is delightful , but do n't let this Spain-full of ideas unbalance your nice old American house . The next thing you know you 'll have a rose between your teeth dusting the heavy carving on the doors of a Spanish armoire ! Beware ! Some headboards I have seen lately on my treks around town may inspire you to change your ways . One called " Venetian " was carved in a ripply triangular shape with an antique gold finish . One , bearing the name " Louis XV , " was hand-carved with cane panels . Another with the title " Baroque " was in an antique gold finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorative and delicate vine motif would be charming for a little girl 's room . Upholstered headboards are practical and good-looking , as you can match your draperies or bedspread for a restful coordinated look . " Louis XVI " proved to be a charming acanthus leaf carving , topping a row of spindles . Then there are those functional compartment headboards that hold everything from radio and books to your favorite bibelots . Or if you have a handy man around the house he can turn your daughter 's simple Hollywood bed into a four-poster  | with a canopy top . And somehow these make every little girl feel like a princess . If you can pick up one of the old iron beds , or buy one of the unpainted wooden models , you can paint it the most heavenly color ? carnation pink , mimosa yellow , cantaloupe , delphinium blue , or for the masculine member , a regimental red , Java-brown , or a shiny black . Remember headboards the next time you just have to do something about that bedroom ! The age of elegance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of luxury in the model rooms and the special boutiques set up to lure you with gray glass ducks , embroidered satin bedspreads , and richly pricked needlepoint hassocks . There is a great choice of dark walls , light walls , monotone rooms , rooms with startling contrasts . So about your best bet , whether you go the elegant way or choose the simple road , is to be yourself . Here are some suggestions that may stimulate you : a monotone room , all in beige , punctuated with lots of sparkling amber glass , an " orangey " beige rug , and a tall green palm in the corner . . . . An all-white room with white sofa and chairs , white and green pillows on the sofa , black lamps ? and a green palm in the corner . ( Palms seem to have emerged from the past and are again much in evidence . ) .. . A room with white walls and white curtains , black rug , black sofa with a leopard pillow on it , and black slatted chairs around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting the only color . . . . There 's an interesting new trend of painting furniture in sort of a rubbed-down blueberry blue . Just saw an all-blue bedroom , cupboards , etc. , painted blue , blue and  | white print bedspread and yellow pictures the only contrast . Quite striking ! Which is for you ? I do n't know what the season will be when you 're looking at this , but let 's say it 's time to rhyme moon with June . And although we are as poetic as the next one at times , just now we are feeling practical , so here is our memo to a Bride : Before you buy a thing , make up your own mind what you want your house to look like . Do n't listen to too much advice from friends . It 's confusing . Do n't be afraid to be original . Close your ears to " Nobody does that . " Use clear , fresh colors that will make your heart sing when you look at them . Remember that pictures like company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and hang them in groups . ( The pictures , not the relatives . ) Area rugs are more practical than wall-to-wall carpets for new brides because you will have no problem when you move . If you have a picture window , do n't choke it to death with blinds , heavy draperies , criss-cross curtains or hamper it with a big lamp shade on a table that should n't be there anyway . With a white background you can change the color mood of your room with the seasons . Make your rooms express you ? and your first home will be something you 'll always remember with pride . Good luck ! If you want a matching color scheme , get your material first . It is easier for your painter ( or you ) to mix a color to match material than it is for you to find material that exactly matches a finished paint job .  | Three short thoughts for you ! Slipcovers can be made of almost anything . I had some slipcovers at one time that were pure white bath toweling welted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marshmallows ? the sofa like a snowdrift . Do n't ever be afraid to use touches of the same color throughout the house , provided you like it . Just as the main theme appears and reappears throughout a symphony , so you can carry one note of color ( in different tones ) through your whole house for a beautiful effect . End tables that flank your sofa are so often too small and too fragile . They should be large enough and sturdy enough to carry good big lamps and be exactly the same height as the arm of the sofa . No decorator , either professional or amateur , who is worth her salt really plans her color schemes from a card index file . The world is full of beautiful colors to choose from and everyone has her own individual preferences . Select the loveliest colors you can find , throw them together , and your taste , resourcefulness , and independence will carry you through . It is always fascinating to me to see what people do with their houses or apartments . A well-dressed person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows what gloves go with her costume , so she seems to sense ( there are no rules ) what kind of a lamp shade belongs on a lamp or what color makes a happy background for her personality . I have some friends who have a house in the country with an attractive living room . They claim that the wall paper they chose is such a perfect background that it enhances all  | feminine guests . Perhaps it 's just because they are having a good time and look so happy , but everyone does seem to look charming . Choose a background that will make you sparkle ! It is astonishing how basic principles never change ! Recently on a trip to Ireland I visited one of the great old Irish houses near Dublin . There were two living rooms on the second floor hung with portraits dating back to the early nineteenth century , and you 'll never guess what color the walls were ! Orange ! This is supposed to be a fresh modern color and here this had been on there for five generations ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was painted beige , the beautifully carved ceiling and cornice were of the same color . On the floor was a white Aubusson rug with skyblue and pink flowers ; upholstered chairs were in cerulean blue . The room was filled with flowers , and with the sun streaming through those old windows it was unbelievably beautiful . What amazed me was the fact that the orange background did not dominate the paintings but seemed to show off their rare quality to the best advantage . The moral of this is : whether you have a grand old house or a tiny one-room apartment , remember that a luscious color is the most effective decorating partner you can choose ! When you are shopping for an accent , do n't be taken in by a sales line . An antique may be as old as the hills and still ugly . Something may have been manufactured yesterday and be rare and beautiful . It may have first seen the light of day in some faraway , exotic country or in the next block . How can that affect it ? Trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have started whole new modes by seeing beauty where others passed it by .  | If you have a hall closet a certain amount of space must be reserved for guests ' coats . It is nice to keep special coat hangers for guests . Noticeable smart ones of lacquerred or some other bright color ? all the same size and color ? brighten the closet and are practical too . Have enough so that when you have a party there is a hanger for each guest . Some people never eat anywhere but in their dining room . What a chance for a change they are missing ! We all ca n't travel as much as we would like , but we can manage to eat a variety of foods from different countries : spaghetti Milanese , chili Loredo , Vermont baked beans and brown bread , etc. , in different places in our own home . Try a dinner on those individual lap-level , king sized tray stands . Put up a card table with a flower-sprinkled cloth in front of the fire . Use your coffee table as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touching the floor . Or ( if you 're young enough ) treat it as a Japanese table and sit around it on cushions on the floor . If there are just two of you , try Sunday morning breakfast on the table in the corner of your bedroom . Variety is the spice of life and we all need a little spice in our diet now and then ! Have you ever walked into a room and thought to yourself , " What 's wrong with this room ? The colors are lovely , the furniture is most attractive , but what 's missing ? " Then you realize the room lacks " shine . " Nothing sparkles ; nothing glistens . The room needs to be awakened with the glint of polished brass of fender and andirons , with the gleam of a beautiful mirror , with the luster of old silver cigarette boxes polished to a gentle shimmer , sparkling glass ash trays ,  | gilt picture frames , a brass bowl for flowers , glass vases . These can make a room come alive ! Crystal or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget the lighted fire . The next time you take a private inventory of your living room , make sure yours does n't lack shine ! I 'm all for the people who are taking smaller houses so that they can get more fun out of life . Summer is the time to get out of doors , the time to cut your housekeeping chores down to a minimum , the time to take advantage of all the plastic wonders of the era , the time to use paper plates on the terrace , the time of summer rugs , the time to clear out the clutter of winter ? and pour out the iced punch . Summer colors are as flamboyant as summer herself . Camping equipment has shed the old khaki for scarlet , yellow , and a summer-sky blue . Sailboats careen across the harbors with sails of red and white stripes , brilliant blues and mandarin yellow . Tents come with gaudy circus stripe flaps . If you have n't already done so , get on the bandwagon of color for summer , in your clothes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car ? and do n't forget to carry a gay umbrella on a rainy day ! Are you the type that loves to be outdoors in the summer but never gets around to " fix up " more than an old folding chair under the apple tree ? Shame on you ! This year get an early start and make a pleasant group , a big low table , some comfortable chairs ( the new outdoor furniture is worth trying ) , if possible partly in the shade and partly in the sun , and relax with your friends and frosted glasses filled with tinkling ice . You might even build a fireplace , and if you do , build it  | where the smoke wo n't take a contrary swush and head for the eyes of your guests waiting for that hamburger . Study prevailing summer wind direction . Paint the furniture white and have cushions for the chairs and chaise in bright paint-box colors . Patio lamps can be stuck in the ground for light . Beach rolls make excellent mats for grass sitters . Hang up an old-fashioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer hours and enjoy yourself . But get started , " It 's later than you think ! " Along with all the yearly sales that are offered at this time of year many of the stores have their own home furnishings shows , and one chose as its theme " Early American ? the Good Mixer . " The headings were nicely novel . For instance , one " Accented with French " showed a bedroom , mixing the French provincial with a distinct early American background . A dining room which they labeled " Flavored with Oriental " displayed early American pieces with basket stools in the Far East tradition . Another bedroom with a chest at the bottom of the bed and decidedly Spanish draperies on the tester bed said , " Spiced with Spanish . " A colorful meeting of sturdy early American and the gaiety of Spain . Then there was a dining-living room that showed how early American " Mingled with Italian . " Striped chair seats on early American slat-backed chairs at a long table were mated with a series of Italian provincial chests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see ? and proof positive that early Americana is a good mixer in any language ! So stop worrying whether your early American tables will " fight " with your French provincial sectional or your Danish chair . Early American  | furniture , like all good Americans , can get along anywhere ? with anybody . So there ! All over the country in offices , supermarkets , and factories , people stop whatever they are doing to have a " coffee break . " I do n't know how you feel about coffee but how about color ? Would n't it be a good idea if you gave yourself a " color break " ? Break away from the same old colors you 've been using year after year . Stop thinking that regimental red is too gay for your house . Bring a little of the rainbow into your life with a new feeling for color . We hear about people being color blind . I think that many people are blind to any color but rose beige , beige , and brown . Why not experiment a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bristol blue , purple iris , Empire green , blueberry blue , or a zingy tangerine ? Bestir yourself from that same old color fixation . You 'll be surprised how much fun it is to wake up in a bedroom that is aglow with color . It starts the day in a good-to-be-alive mood , and all sorts of nice things may happen before evening . With a room painted in lemon-peel yellow , it does n't matter if it 's pouring outside . Inside the sun seems to be shining and when you drop some tangerine and white touches around with a spot of black here and there you 'll wonder how you ever tolerated your old color scheme . Do n't wait until the mortgage is paid or junior is through college ; give yourself a color break now ! It 's much cheaper than hiring a psychiatrist ? and the whole family can share the results ! It does n't matter so much what color you choose . It 's what you do with it that counts . A color can be pretty heavy  | used one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light touch . Take purple , for instance . A room plunged all in purple or even a group of purple chairs can be as grim-looking as a deep and dark cave , but toss a few purple pillows on a snowwhite sofa , or post a row of amethyst jars in a window with the sun shining through them and the effect is magic . Someone may say , " I do n't like black . It 's too gloomy ! " That 's not the right word at all . It is dramatic , but oh , how black can come to the aid of a decorating problem ! If you have a room that is neat and tidy but a little on the " blah " side , try a few touches of ebony and see what a new personality that room takes on ! To me , slices of red dropped casually around a room are much more effective than an all red room ? and much simpler to change when you become tired of that particular color . However , regimental red walls , black accessories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . All color is lovely if used right , but the most heavenly color in the world in the wrong place can upset the applecart . So let your own good taste be your guide and see that your color applecart stays right side up ! Flowers are all over the place these days ! They are back on the new wallpapers , not in tiny delicate blossoms , but in swaggering sprays , often paired with life-sized birds . The new fabrics are all a-bloom with old-fashioned nosegays or stylized versions of a poppy or a shaft of wheat . Sheets and pillow cases turn every bedroom into a flower bower . And they 're pretty enough to use for curtains and bedspreads or as slipcovers for bedside chairs . There is nothing namby-pamby about these new florals . They are bold and bright and " raring to go . "  | Towels and shower curtains are having a heyday with flowers ? some sprinkled about , some splashed all over , and some in colors defying nature 's own , in panels and borders . Even the plainest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in today 's flower garden . You can even walk on great clumps of tulips . Area rugs have flowers running rampant in all-over or border patterns . And china is in the swim too , and it almost seems a shame to drown a glazed life-like morning glory in your mushroom sauce . If you have n't already joined the Parade of Flowers ? do ! There is an old saying that , " Flowers are for happiness , " so say it with flowers all over the house ! " What do you do about a fireplace in the summer ? " Personally , I like to see a fire laid , ready for some of those cool evenings that come along even in the hottest months . I do not go for fancy fans , paper or metal , stuck into the fireplace opening . I think they look far hotter than neatly laid honest old logs resting on shining brass andirons . And I think something I saw the other day would be too horrible to contemplate ! It was a fireplace screen that would " hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in use . " It had a " bronze frame with white linerboard panels that could be covered with wallpaper fabric or vinyl adhesive , " so the sign said . And it looked a mess ? awkward , clumsy . I can not imagine who would want to debase a fireplace with such a contraption . Far better , a nice old butter tub , painted shiny black , or a big pitcher filled with cool-looking rhododendron leaves if you feel you must do something with your fireplace . And one lady I know puts a tiny fan where the logs usually go and hides it in back of a huge out-spreading fern , so that it looks  | as if a fine lazy breeze were wafting through the greenery . But if you were to ask me what to do , I would have to tell you that I leave my fireplace ready to light at the drop of a hat ( or the temperature ) summer and winter ? and that would be my advice to you ! Have you been idea shopping lately ? It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other day I went browsing through one of the large stores which had done an intriguing job of selling " Romance Everlasting " as a theme . Pieces of furniture , fabrics , and accessories had been garnered from all over the world and placed in room settings of great charm . But it all looked a little too Old World and hard to maintain until I stopped and said to myself , " Now , how could some of these ideas be translated into practical use for today 's homemaker ? " A raised dining area with a large table and high-backed chairs looked out on three arches which held a far-away scene , seeming to stretch that wall out into fascinating imaginative areas . The arches in this room were part of the architectural planning , but you could find wallpaper panels which would have the same effect . There were quite a few hanging cabinets filled with treasures , which is a good idea for a long wall ( and if your husband is handy with a saw and a hammer , he could copy one for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and these you can buy in the hardware store ? for hanging lanterns , bird cages , pots of vines , or for joining two pictures together in a decorative festoon . Even if you get but one idea out of an afternoon of idea shopping , it 's worth it . And the " looking " is free ! So take along a pad and jot down what you think is for you !  | There 's a lot of talk on the home-fashion front these days about " bringing back the homey look . " In my own part of the world it has never been away . I like elegance and formality in their place , yes , but not the frosty artificial type that chills you as you sit down on the white satin sofa . What are some of the things that create that homey look ? A mixture of furniture relaxes a room . A Victorian chair slipcovered or upholstered in a bright new fabric lends a pleasant special something to the modern sofa and chairs . Bookcases , filled with colorful book jackets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant nook can be fashioned by installing a love seat , flanked by two narrow chests of drawers . I saw one recently in front of a long window . The love seat , just sill height , had been covered with the same printed fabric as the draperies . It looked homey , comfortable , and inviting . Fabrics can do much to set the tone of a place . Some people feel at home with , say , giant poppies strewn over a vibrant background , while somebody else may be more at ease with a small documentary print . It 's what a fabric can do for you that is important . Of course , there is nothing like a living plant or a bouquet of bright flowers to bring the home-sweet-home touch to any room . Even fake flowers mixed with real lemon leaves add a certain warmth and create a delectable stab of color . Does your house have a homey look ? If not , get busy today ! Never overlook the power of " little things " ! " An atom , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chemical element , " but look what the world did with this " smallest constituent " in the bomb area ! The little things I am thinking of pertain to houses and  | have happier endings . If you are the " oh , I ca n't be bothered " type , you wo n't be interested , but please believe , this attention to small details is what makes for a charming whole effect . Instead of hanging up your kitchen scissors , ladles , or other et ceteras on a nail , why not get one of those decorative brass hooks in the shape of an eagle or whatever goes with your house ? And do n't toss just any old magazine on the table with the orange marigolds . Go over your magazines and select a cover in colors that are on friendly terms with the orange flowers . Grouping three objects on a mantel can transform the whole meager look of three objects spread out in lonely single file . Instead of straddling a bouquet with candles on either side , try two , side by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your painted chest to make another white accent in your bedroom . Try arranging two identical chairs , companionably side by side in front of the fireplace instead of dropping them in lovely outposts around the room . Pay attention to the " little things . " They reward your room in a " big " way ! There is an old proverb that goes , " A bee without a sting makes no honey . " What has that got to do with furnishing a home ? Immediately I thought of the people who are so afraid of a mistake , so reluctant to take a chance with some new idea that their rooms lack color , originality , and even a hint of flair . It 's better to be a little daring and make a few mistakes than it is never to branch out into a new color range or a new type of curtain or a different arrangement of furniture . If you do n't try something new and different once in a while ,  | life on the home front can become pretty boring . Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , " you say , " we always stick to plain colors . They 're more practical in the long run . " Well , who wants that long a run on a dreary color to begin with ? Why not try a flower garden effect for a change ? It might work more wonders in more ways than you think . Then there 's the rug concept ? a gayer , more brilliant area rug to replace that status symbol wall-to-wall beige of yesterday . It 's worth a try and it will bring your room up to date in a nice , fresh fashion . Go ahead , be a little daring , get away from your old stickin-the-mud die-hard tactics . Try something new ! It 's better to have an alive " mistake " than a dead-looking room ! A friend of mine recently described a house she had just visited . " The whole house was just too-too ! " she ended her discourse . And I know exactly what she meant . Too many fancy draperies , too many little knick-knacks that did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of everything ! We all want a house that looks lived in , cheerful , comfortable , and colorful , but you know what a pinch of too much salt can do to a stew , well , too much decorating can spoil the taste in a house as well . A dollop of fringe is fine but to edge every curtain , every bedspread and every towel in every room is much too much . One bright idea can " make " a room , but if you find it repeated in every room it loses its power and falls into the " too-too " class . One attractive chest painted with gay Pennsylvania Dutch motifs is quite enchanting in an appropriate setting , but a whole roomful of furniture painted in this fashion would  | make you feel as if you were forever living inside a decorated cookie jar . Let 's tour your house ! Do your rooms have that " too-too " look ? When I was a child our china cups were paper thin , and the pattern was a pretty one , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over again , with the same candles , placed at exactly the same place every night on the prim white tablecloth . Only on birthdays was the table routine changed . Today you may have a tablecloth the color of a scarlet bird one night with milk-white glass accessories and the next night have a lively parrot-green cloth with canary accessories , or grape-purple mats with amethyst glassware and the green of the grape leaves in plates and cups . Everyone loves the excitement of surprise , and with the price tags so pleasingly low on gay china and tablecloths , there 's no excuse for setting a table the same way every night . Make this your personal " let 's do something different with our table setting " week and enjoy every minute of it ! Have you ever walked into a room that was so jumping with ideas the whole effect became just a conglomerate blur ? Nothing stood out for your acclaim because everything cried at once , " Look at me ! " That old cliche " do n't put all of your eggs into one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splurge all of your good ideas on one room . Save some of them for the rest of the house . If you spread some of your special touches around a bit , the effect will be more delightfully subtle and impressive .  | A friend of mine in Ohio is an avid reader of so-called home magazines . She not only reads them from cover to cover , but has put so many of their suggestions into effect , her living room looks like a patchwork quilt of ideas , none of them related . The moral is to let your few good touches or inspirations stand out , and do n't go overboard . ( This , of course , refers to all those other women , not you . ) The other day I saw an ad for ceramic tile . Perhaps you saw it too . It showed some ideas on how to dress up your bathroom , and although some of them were n't exactly budget items , sometimes it is fun to dream a little even if you ca n't afford to make it come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framed in gold , a crystal chandelier , gold-plated fixtures and accessories , a decorative watercolor , recessed light above the sink ( anybody could afford that ) , a window conservatory , a sunken tub , one side of which formed a long bath seat , an over-sized niche for soap and powder , and of course , floors and walls of ceramic tile . Do any of these items inspire you ? The large mirror framed in gold might give your bathroom just the lift it has needed . The thought of a watercolor in the bathroom is a refreshing idea and if your window is placed right for plants you might start a modest window conservatory . Gold-plated fixtures and accessories would make a good anniversary present ( one at a time ) and might make you feel as elegant as a princess every time you took a bath . Look your bathroom over . One of these ideas might be just the " pick up " you 've been looking for . Put your own ingenuity to work !  | Everybody seems to plan for a fireplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when building your own house you can plan and place your fireplace wherever you want it . But when you buy an old house you often find that your fireplace is off-center leaving a longer wall space on one side than on the other . The best thing to do with your off-center fireplace is to set a good heavy piece of furniture , like a sofa , right opposite . Do n't center the sofa on the wall , as you normally would do , or it will be out of line with the fireplace and look more higgledy-piggledy than ever . When you have lined up the sofa and the fireplace you can arrange the long end of your room as a square , or oblong space with a balanced decorative scheme of its own . And please do n't go to all that expense of having a fireplace put in just to sit and look at it . Light the fire ! I go into many of the new little houses and there sits the fireplace ? and I know that no ash has ever been allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy the magic of a fire as it crackles its merry way up the chimney . Some words have an intriguing sound to me . For instance , " bamboo " always has had a sort of staccato cadence , remindful of the rhythm of bongo drums and deep forests . " Bamboo ! " Today we find this magic word has popped up in almost every corner of the home , and it has added a lightness of spirit especially appropriate for the summer months . Inexpensive and fitting in with almost every decor are natural rollup blinds , draperies to the floor , printed cafe curtains , and even folding doors of bamboo . Think how cleverly  | you could transform a stolid old room with this Oriental grass . Then we have bamboo picture frames , knives and forks with handles of bamboo for the terrace , place mats , and other incidentals . There 's no excuse for a dull house with all the wonderful new ideas just waiting to be plucked from their packing cases and settled in your house . Experiment once in a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And now 's the time to do it ! The word " litter " has all kinds of meanings . The first one given in most dictionaries is " things scattered about . " I like that one , since I am going to talk about the litter of gracious living . There is a great difference in the unpleasant meaning of " litter " and the sort of conglomerate , happy-go-lucky litter of a house that is lived in . Have n't you walked into a house that was so " picked up " it looked as if the family had just moved in ? There were no personal knick-knacks about , no book turned down on a table , no magazines well-thumbed , nothing to indicate that a real , live human being had been in the room recently . I have all kinds of things that I am sure other people would consider " litter " on one of my living room tables ? a tiny black dog , sleeping on a blue satin pillow I made for him many years ago , a porcelain water lily that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several framed snapshots of my family , an original Gainsborough in a gold drawing easel frame , etc. , but having them there makes my home " mine " and that is as it should be , do n't you think ? Every once in a while we need a change . Our house  | is no exception . To walk into a room and always find everything in exactly the same place as the last time you were there becomes monotonous . And if visitors get that feeling , how about your family ? But what can we do that wo n't cost too much ? First , switch a few things around , put the table there instead of here where it has always been , put those two chairs together instead of across the room from each other . Paint the chair in the hall a different color . Give it fresh " oomph " with a gay new cushion . It may be only a small thing , but it will count . For instance , I am going to change my black lamp shades to gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will give me a lift every time I come into the room . Just recently I took down a large antique tapestry and grouped ancestral portraits there , and you ca n't imagine what a difference this made . Try shoving things around , add crisp artificial flowers , some fruit , a new picture while you hum " There 'll be some changes made today ! " Sometimes the people who have the least to spend have the most attractive apartments . I remember one young couple who had taken a charming apartment overlooking the harbor in San Francisco . They had decided to put their money into the location and furnish the apartment as inexpensively as possible , and I would have been happy to have moved right in . The walls were white and in the bay window looking out over the water was a round table with a tablecloth of brilliant yellow felt , going down to the floor . The floor was black with straw rugs . The inexpensive sofa-bed with its iron legs had a foam  | rubber cushion and long bolster in orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accessories , mostly given by the family were lovely ? lamps , pictures , and shiny brass andirons and fender . The result had a charming lightheartedness about it and taught a good lesson I thought . If you do n't want to put much money in furnishings , it 's better to buy good inexpensive types and use them attractively than to try to buy cheap copies of the heavy expensive models . With the world as it is today everyone seems to feel the need of making her own little nest as cheerful and full of color as possible ? and I think it 's a very reassuring sign . Color is the least expensive " pick up " ? and do try something new ! If you 've had your yellow streak , try pink ! If you 're a brown thrush , hop onto red , and if you 've been timid about forsaking green , try a stark white with definite black and , say , tangerine accents . Flowers , real or otherwise , or a bowl of ripe fruit can make a difference in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while just to confuse your husband into noticing things . Wear a different color dress around the house , experiment with a new hair-do , and make your house and you say , " Hey , look at me ! " Many people write me letters but a lady in Missouri seemed to me to have an interesting idea and I thought she would n't mind if I passed it on to you . Her letter said , " I read your article on Sentimental Touches Make a House a Home . ' Being a person whose family is my entire life , I certainly agreed with you that every home needs some reminder of your family background , your childhood and  | other pleasant moments that can only be recalled by mementoes of one sort or another . " One day as I was reminiscing by looking through our son 's baby book , I turned to the page with the family tree . Suddenly I thought , why could n't something of this type be included in the decorating of a home . ' So here is the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have one wall painted a pale yellow and on this wall , starting at the baseboard and going almost to the ceiling , is painted a family tree in tones of brown with gold-yellow leaves . At the top of the trunk of the tree in a small round frame hangs a picture of our son . On the branches to the right is the same arrangement for my husband and his family . " Now , is n't that a novel idea for those family photographs ? I was flicking through the pages of a current magazine the other day and admiring all the colorful ideas when I came across this sentence , " A white room with each chair a different bold color , red , blue , yellow , green , would be exciting . " That 's the kind of excitement I could do without . Up to then everything had been fine . That stopped me . When I thought of all the people who read that magazine and all the living rooms that might sprout this rainbow effect , I shuddered . For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyeful of color to contrast with the green lawn , but in a living room , no , not for me ! I love color , but not when it jumps at you from every chair . That is where so many people get into trouble , trying to pack too many colors in one room . It 's so much safer to stick to , say , three colors . Ca n't you imagine coming into a small  | room with its red , blue , yellow , and green chairs at the end of a hot day when everything went wrong ? Better a restful monotone with bright accents , do n't you agree ? On a recent trip to Utah ( on business ) and California ( on pleasure ) , I became convinced that little houses all across the country have been over-sold on the picture window . Granted , they have their place when they frame a lovely view , like a shady brook , a sparkly blue lake , a lovely purple mountain , but what are they doing , shrouded in Venetian blinds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large window and have no view , at least choose a window with small panes . Then everyone is attracted to the window and forgets to contemplate on what 's outside . I love a bay window with pots of flowers on the ledge , or a white gravel trench filled with growing plants with crisp green foliage . And I enjoy having coffee in front of a whole window wall with a lovely view that " brings the outdoors in , " as the ads say , but why have a picture window when there is no picture ? It 's like putting up an empty frame on the wall . So do think before you join the picture window brigade ! Modesty may be a virtue but sometimes it can be a drawback . Whenever I talk with a group of people I find that many are much too modest about themselves , much too prone to lean on someone else for decorative advice . You 'll be amazed at how much you really know and how good your own taste is , if you stop worrying about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you want .  | The other day I visited an apartment that seemed all wrong for the person who inhabited it . Then she started talking about what she liked and it had no relation whatsoever with her surroundings . What she liked sounded charming and I told her so . Well , it seemed a friend who had taken a correspondence course or something in decorating had advised her . I left her with the promise that she would do her place over with her own ideas . She looked happier already ! When decorating , just ask yourself , " does it serve its purpose ? Is it the right scale ? Is it the right color ? " And then go ahead . You 're smarter than you think ! Curtains or draperies , whichever is your personal designation for what hangs at a window , seem to be a problem to many throughout the country . Where to hang them , how to hang them , what kind to hang ? A few fundamentals might help . First , a 4- or 5-inch hem is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let down . Also it adds a little weight to the bottom so that they hang better . ) Curtains may be to the window sill , the floor , or they may be used as cafe curtains . In the old days , all curtains had to be lined or they would fade or would n't hang right . Today they are more attractive without a lining , so that the sun can shimmer through the pattern . And since today 's colors are fast , there is no reason to buy namby-pamby hues . The gay , vibrant florals , stripes , plaids , and plains can make your room sing , whereas a drab curtain makes it grumble . A narrow window can be made to look wider by setting the curtains on the wall outside the window frame . Picture windows take yards of fabric , and if you ca n't afford a good full effect , it 's better to buy gobs of a cheaper fabric than to skimp on an expensive variety .  | A change of curtains has the same effect as a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different ! Someone asked me recently how I felt about changing slipcovers , curtains , etc. , with the seasons ? heavy ones for winter and something light for summer . I think it 's a wonderfully refreshing idea if you can afford it . Inexpensive white curtains , for instance , would make a room look much cooler than heavy , lined draperies . A slipcover gay with field flowers or wide green awning stripes would go much better with iced tea than a sober linen tweed covering . Come to think of it , it really is not an extravagance . You save on wear and tear of your more expensive slipcovers . With the windows opened ( unless you have air conditioning ) your heavy draperies absorb the summer grime . And you can use this summer 's substitutes next summer . Yes , I think a season change is a good idea ! Hand me my swatches of new fabric ! What time of year is it now ? If school bells will soon be clanging , as junior reluctantly gets his first taste of the ABCs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think about the ABCs of getting your house ready for the fall and winter . A. All right , You 've had a fun summer but does n't your house look a little shaggy around the edges ? Arm yourself with a paint brush and a can of some delectable new-color paint and give at least your kitchen and living room a refresher course in looking pretty . Ask yourself , " Am I going to trip over that antiquated rug another year or pick out a new area rug with a little zip in it ? "  | B. Better spend a busy hour or two in the stores and borrow some of their brand new ideas like floral window shades , bright new drapery fabrics , wallpapers with blossoms the like of which you have never seen before . Be prepared to entertain your friends with better seating arrangements , brighter slipcovers , and bigger ash trays . C. Color can do more than anything else to give your house that vitamin touch it needs after the summer . Carry a new color all through the house like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " feeling and go ahead and have the courage of your convictions . Cook up a new look for you and your house ! And do n't stop with these ABCs ! Keep up to Z ( for Zest ) and have fun ! I do n't believe anything in clever decoration can do as much for a room as a glowing fire in an attractive fireplace . As soon as there is a fireplace in a room the whole room centers around it . Men and dogs love an open fire ? and they show good sense ! It does n't matter whether you 're Mrs. Dollar Sign or Mrs. Penny Pincher , unless you have a little flair for doing things , your house is going to be just a so-so house . Even Mrs. Dollar Sign , who can afford the best fabrics and furniture , needs to put her own taste signature on her choice of color , accessories , and placement of furniture or she 's going to end up with a room that belongs to somebody else . The dictionary says that " flair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I say it 's the little things that you do to make ordinary things into something special ? or that little touch  | that transforms an everyday idea into a very special thing . It might be only hanging a picture lower than anybody else , or using large red bandana handkerchiefs in unusual ways ? as mats for pictures , as napkins , or as tie-backs for white kitchen curtains . Flair is sort of undefinable , but if you have it or can acquire it , it 's more valuable than money . So do n't despair if you have to worry over your budget , try a spot of flair ! The tea cart is back in a streamlined edition and how welcome it is ! You can wheel your whole meal to the table at one time , and wheel a load of used dishes back to the kitchen ( makes table work more fun ) ! Or it may serve as a portable bar . One amateur artist I know who lives in a small apartment uses her tea cart ( or whatever the modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting materials ? just rolls it away in her closet when she is n't inspired by the muse . A male photographic shutter-bug with no room for a dark room uses a tea cart to hold all his equipment , and after the dishes are done , he rolls his cart up to the kitchen sink and carries on with his hobby . No wonder tea carts are having a revival ! When planning a guest room , make it say " Come again " instead of " Stay away ! " Some guest rooms do say that , you know . There might as well be signs posted over the bed . The bed is uncomfortable to begin with . There has been no thought given to your reading light . Ash trays are missing . In contrast , how nice to be made to feel " special " and wanted . Everything has been planned for your comfort . Perhaps one rose is beside your bed , cigarettes and matches are  | at hand , a table large enough to hold all of your essentials stands guard by your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew would appeal to you are waiting for your perusal . Look around your guest room , then ask yourself , " Would I like to be a guest at my house ? " Is n't it a paradox that while all the cosmetic companies are advertising creams and lotions to make the old look young , the furniture companies are proudly offering new furniture with that wonderful " old " look ? Never before have there been so many distinguished examples of fine lines with the mellow patina of the past reproduced so faithfully . And the wonderful part about these authentic-looking pieces is that they are perfectly at home with the contemporary mood . Simple lines in furniture , as in clothes , make mixing and matching an easy matter . Any bride would do well to visit the model rooms showing the early American , French and Italian provincial reproductions and the way they mix with antique and modern accessories . Of course , if your Great-aunt Matilda left you a fine old apothecary desk , you 're lucky ! And do n't be afraid to team up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units that has plenty of room at the top for books , bric-a-brac , radio , hi-fi , etc . With the best of the past and the best of the present at hand , how can you miss having a fine future ? If we just would keep our eyes open there are ideas to be found almost anywhere we go . At a recent showing of commercial ideas for hotels I jotted down a few suggestions I thought would be most adaptable to any home .  | One dining room so attractive it had everybody oh-ing and ah-ing was done in strawberry ice-cream pink , white and red , a refreshing color scheme for anybody 's dining room ! The carpet was red . Bright red ( stoplight-red ) squares of linen were used over a white undercloth for the tables ( a copy idea when setting up card tables for a dinner party ) . Chairs alternated in white and strawberry-pink Naugahyde ( so practical to keep clean and yet so delectable-looking with the red ) . A coffee shop suggested a kitchen color scheme in shades of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brown china , white vinyl flooring . Smart with pots of purple African violets . Keep your eyes open for ideas ! I am always enthusiastic about people who have imagination and are n't afraid to use it . Some friends of mine in the Middle West invited me after dinner one night to drive out to see what had been their week-end house but was now their all-week house . We came up out of the woods to a river and there in the moonlight stood a one-storey house of very dark brown wood with white trim and a shocking pink door with a big brass knocker . But leading up to the front door were six shockingpink carrousel horses which they had bought from an old merry-go-round . Three horses pranced up either side of the path and each horse had a pannier or basket filled with white petunias . We ca n't all have carrousel horses on our front lawn , but we can use our imagination . So let 's do it ! So many little things can add up to " Summer Enchantment . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sigh of a summer breeze , a sail in the moonlight , the daisies and  | buttercups , the bright red roses trailing over a gray split-rail fence , the rainbow fountain of a splash as you dive into a lake in the sunshine . But there are also several little things around the house that can add to summer enchantment . Safe , electrified patio lanterns of plastic make a pretty picture as they swing to and fro in the trees . And so many gay summertime tablecloths for eating outdoors , with just the blue sky as an awning ! Have you seen the plastic-coated watermelon tablecloth with its red top , red stripes on white , and even clusters of ebony seeds ? Then there are those fabulous tavern check vinyl covers in bold red , black , yellow , green , or blue with white , so " countryish " and so easy to flick a damp cloth over when the salad spills . And now you can get plastic striped covers , not only for your long table but for your benches as well , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pad is dingy with spots , why not change for a yellow , green , or turquoise replacement pad to wake up your terrace ? Do n't save your bright plaid thermo-jug just for picnics . Fill it full of ice-cold lemonade and let it add a dash of color to your summer setting . Think up your own bit of summer enchantment to add to your pleasure ? and make the most of it ! Although we 're living in a " space " age and we hear the word about every other sentence ? " We need space for this , space for that , rockets are flying into space , there 's not enough space , etc. , " we really do n't need too much of that word " space " to be comfortable . Every bedroom should have a comfortable chair . In my bedroom I have one covered to match the flowered pink curtains around my four-poster bed . I think every mother should  | have a place to drop down even for five minutes while Junior is taking his nap . A comfortable sofa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good drop-down place for a short rest . Or put the dining room to some other use besides eating . Convert a corner for a relaxing spot of quiet . You do n't need more space . You just need to put the space you have to better use for more comfort . Start now ! To err in decorating is human but to live with your mistake is far from divine , it 's ridiculous and may lead to all kinds of unhappy moments . One woman bought two wing chairs . The minute she put them beside the fireplace she realized they were much too big and dwarfed everything else in the room . But did she take them back ? No ! It seemed like too much bother . So she kept them . They gradually became like personal enemies standing there so belligerently big , and , though realizing it was her mistake , she began to get cross with her poor husband . To make a long story short , she got rid of them at a loss and harmony was restored . But how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and returned them immediately . When selecting wallpaper , it 's a good idea to buy a whole roll and live with it for a while before your final decision . Today with high taxes and what not , we ca n't afford many mistakes , but if you do make one , do n't live with it . Get rid of it and start over , you 'll be happier and so will everyone else , including your room ! In the not so distant yesterdays , many people never mentioned the word " bar " in the home circles . That was on a par with " saloon . " But today practically every house has a  | little corner reserved for a bottle of sherry , rye , bourbon , coke , or ginger ale . You may not drink any of them , but you have them on hand for guests . Almost anything may serve as a bar . Recently I saw a tiny spot between the living room and the kitchen set aside for a small marble-top table , and over it was an interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old early American commode is transformed into a miniature but efficient bar . A dry sink often is used as a practical place to dispense spirits . A bar cart , on sale in any department store , sometimes on wheels or one of the new service or tea carts may be put to use to good advantage . Hanging shelves ( to hold glasses ) and a table below is a simple arrangement , and if it can be somewhere near the refrigerator so much the better . In other words , a bar does n't have to be as elaborate as one shown in a movie , but it is a practical idea to have a prepared spot for serving the liquids . Amused and puzzled the other day , I read an advertisement for a course in interior decorating that said , " interior decoration kit furnished . " What in the world would you find in an interior decoration kit that would help you " do " a room ? It makes me shudder to think of it . Imagine opening up your little box or kit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little box A , fishing out the rule for what to do with a room with four windows . Then in box B would be a bag of tricks for making ceilings look lower or hallways larger or whatever the problem might be . All solved with the little old interior decoration kit . No , it wo n't work . All you need is your own good taste , some of today 's luscious colors and fabrics , and lots of cour- age to try something new . Any " kit on interior decoration , " no matter how elaborate , is about as mythical as Pandora 's box and just as impractical . So many people believe there is something deep and mysterious about interior decoration ? that you have to know all sorts of complicated details and rules before you can lift a finger . Well , you do n't . All you need is a delight in color , an awareness of balance , a feeling for lighting , a sense of style , a zest for life , and an amused enjoyment of the smart accessories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of imagination and transform that room ! Have n't you often played a game with yourself , looking at houses you passed somewhere and wondering what the people who lived in them were like ? I am going to suggest that you try the experiment of looking at your own house from this objective point of view . Since most of us do much of our entertaining after dark , it is well to examine your house from the outside some evening when the lights are lit . Do n't take anything you see for granted . It 's ten chances to one you 'll catch yourself exclaiming , " Good gracious , I did n't know the front door needed painting again . Urn ! The grass does n't grow well close to the step . A pair of evergreen trees in white painted wooden tubs , maybe ? " Then how about a big brass knocker ? And a quart of good enamel paint does n't cost much , and it does n't require a skilled painter to paint a front door . How about a turquoise blue or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sunflowers ? Think of a white house with a door painted the color of blue gentians in the sun . Just a few little changes , and you 're bound to be happy with the people who live in your house .  | I do n't know of any other pastime as much fun as " peeking , " as the children say , at other people 's ingenuity . From my friend 's apartment in Washington Square you can " peek " at all the backyard patios , and one has me captivated . The couple with the sun deck are evidently of a nautical turn of mind . They have covered the roof outside their apartment with tarpaulin and fenced it in with white painted rope laced through white painted wooden posts . They have hung a pair of life preservers on either side of the door and above these are two shining brass ship 's lanterns fitted with electric lights . Blue canvas deck chairs and a white canvas hammock with blue cushions complete the picture . All summer long , they give parties , play shuffleboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their guests were cruising somewhere in the tropical seas . And by the sound of the gay laughter they have a wonderful time , with no worry about typhoons or getting seasick . Is n't it exciting what a little ingenuity can do ? Why not experiment this year ? Get out of that well-worn rut and try something new , even if it is only a new hair-do or a flaming red bath towel ! I like collections that can be used . Just getting things to put up on a shelf to gather dust does n't appeal to me . If you 're going to collect mugs , for instance , why not collect the kind that you can bring out , filled with steaming coffee on a cold December night ? Or cups and saucers ! Why not use them at your next dinner party , with each guest having a different pattern . There would be no lack of table conversation I 'm sure . Pitchers , soap dishes , tiny primitives , banks , dolls , all make collectors of these items drool when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that men become as interested as their bargain-hunting spouses , so it becomes a family affair . Most collections give a home a touch of individuality , so why not join the family of collectors ? But do collect something you can use ! The people who pine for " the good old days " would n't go back there if they , by some miraculous alchemy , could ! To take just the simple things like facial tissues , electric appliances , cake mixes , frozen food ? how would we get along without them now ? What started me thinking about this was the word " vinyl . " I wonder if we realize how that word has taken over our houses today . Have you see the new vinyl wall coverings that are soil , stain , and scuff resistant ? Imagine what a boon this must be for a family with children who seem to practically crawl up the walls leaving them all marked up . The wall coverings come in all sorts of patterns and colors bound to please even the most discriminating , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blossomed out into vinyl patterns never dreamed of before , and make housekeeping a joy ( well , easier anyway ) . - I even saw vinyl tiles in a table setting the other day . Delft tiles of vinyl were used to protect a whole bevy of flower pots filled with pretty blooms to match the table setting . What with vinyl upholstery and counter tops , who wants the good old oilcloth days back ? Blues songs usually are pretty mournful things to listen to , with their sad , wailing low notes . And for years we have been hearing about people who " get the blues when it rains , " etc . Now comes a whole new color range called the  | " Happy Blues . " It 's a pleasant change ! And just wait and see how your house will respond to this singing of the happy blues . You can use the blues with other colors or do a subtle casting in one room of slate blue , blue mist , delphinium blue , Bristol blue , periwinkle , hyacinth , and regal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but is a kissin ' cousin of the Blue family ) . There is quite a variety as you can use the blue in stripes , checks , florals , plaids , and tiny provincial prints in combination with your plain blues . The craze for the blues has even reached the tables and all the mats and tablecloths are keyed to the new blue note . Mixed or matched , it brings a refreshing new look to a home . If you are weary of the tangerines , reds , and yellows , wear your sapphire and join the chorus of the Happy Blues ! It 's a push button age we 're living in , but no push button is more popular than the one on the paint spray can . What exciting transformations can be wrought when the paint comes spraying out ! Picture frames , headboards , old tables , mirror frames , discarded chairs ? all can be changed from drab ugly ducklings into things that make a room fairly sizzle with their gay Spanish pinks , Chinese yellows , Sicilian greens , or shiny expresso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and covered with a lemon-peel yellow seat look invitingly modern and gay and call for a rejuvenation of the rest of the room . You 'll be surprised at what this color spray can do for your spirits . Nobody would think of applying a drab old brown or a stone-wall gray . Somehow , when you push that button you want to see something alive and cheerful coming out . And  | even people who would n't think of brushing on a peacock blue , seem to feel " the brighter , the better " when they get their hand on the throttle of that spray gun . Look around your house and experiment on one piece . It 's fun ! Do you know people who " close off " rooms for this or that reason ? Somehow it does something to a house . I like the feeling of looking through a doorway into a , room or hall beyond . I like to be able to walk into a room without having to " lift the latch . " One of the large card shops here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold . They tell me there is something about the invitation of the open door that makes people wander in and buy cards . When I am at a party and doors are closed , I always wonder why . In the old days , I know certain rooms that were n't used very much were closed off to heat the lived-in rooms , but today with heating no problem I 'm all for having " open " house . If you have a room that has become a stepchild so that you have to keep the door closed , make that your next project and do something interesting with it ? and open that door ! " Proper " is such a Victorian-sounding word , and yet many modern people seem to be worrying whether something is proper to use with something else . Personally , I would n't care whether it was proper or not . Do you like it ? Does it look well ? That 's the important thing . " Is it proper to use round coffee tables with square end tables ? Is it proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's proper if you like it and they look right together . There is  | no greater expert than you if you have good taste . Remember that ! You do n't have to know any rules or have to give a reason for liking something . Half the time I could n't explain why I combine certain colors or arrange things on a table or mantel the way I do . You are confronted with certain elements and you try out the way that pleases you and that 's it ! Once Danny Kaye , who has traveled all over the world for both his movies and U.N . Children 's Fund commitments said , " Whether it 's a grass hut or a peasant 's cottage it 's a compliment to be invited into a man 's home . " Have you ever thought of an invitation that way ? I think it 's true . It 's fun to eat in restaurants and order just what you want , but it lacks the warmth and intimacy of sitting around a table or even balancing a tray in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as Danny Kaye says , then we must try to make the evening a memorable one . That does n't mean you have to get out the best silver or serve pheasant under glass ( which always sounds most uninviting to me ) , but it means we must look forward to the occasion ourselves . Forget about our own petty worries and think of some pleasant bit of conversation to spring on the guest ? something of interest to show or some special dish to produce , be it baked macaroni with a new cheese the local delicatessen has just imported or a throw-everything-into-it salad . Fresh flowers , an eye-catching new tablecloth , and lots of laughter ? think of " complimenting " the next guest with your invitation into your home ! Have you thought of using a tree for a corner decoration ? It 's becoming " quite the thing , " as the fashion magazines say , to fill an otherwise empty corner with a fake tree .  | It may be anything from a wispy weeping willow to a crisp white-flowered dogwood . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside , but is much more decorative with its irregular-shaped branches than a chair or chest . If you are lucky enough to have friends who live in the country , ask them to bring in some good-sized branches from an apple ( or any ) tree . Then buy some artificial flowers or leaves of the variety you like , and make your own tree . Set it in an interesting container filled with stones and dirt to hold the tree in place . It may be a copper pot , a wooden tub painted a gay color , or a wide-mouthed can placed inside an intriguing basket . If you plan your lighting just right you should be able to muster up some enchanting wall shadows with your branch effects . Do try it ! Somewhere I came across the proclamation , " We endorse individuality . " And to that I say " Amen ! " And down with all regimentation and having a sectional , or wall-to-wall carpet just because everyone else does ! How refreshing it is to walk into a house that has been touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplest things ? the way a curtain is hung , putting stripes horizontally instead of vertically , papering the ceiling instead of the side walls , hanging a basket of flowers on a front door , having a banquette built on one wall of the dining room , serving dinner on puffy floor cushions before a huge low coffee table , or using a great copper ice bucket for a centerpiece of copper and gold marigolds . I have a friend who is so generous herself that people are always giving her things . And I always admire how she dis- penses these gifts around her country house . She seems to drop things around so nonchalantly , but they always look so right that you ca n't imagine them anywhere else . Ship models made by childish admirers find their way on a paneled ledge going upstairs . A large oval candy jar becomes the proud owner of gumdrops which add quite a kaleidoscope of colors on a round table by the green linen sofa . A Bennington bowl filled with yellow daisies seems to have been born for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your house " endorse individuality " ? If not , get busy ! We know that soldiers need courage , but that 's a special brand of courage . You need some Type " D " ( for " decorating " ) courage to experiment , courage to seek out your own taste and express it , courage to disregard a stereotyped idea and try out your own . Redecorating your living room in some new , enchanting color or moving your furniture around may well be as drastic a psychological change as it is for a man to change jobs or for a woman to change husbands . I know a very conservative English bulldog who barks furiously if the furniture is disarranged . Many of us feel just that way although we are unconscious of it . Before you become your own decorator you must first become a critic . Before you make any decisions look the field over carefully . Take inventory of what the market has to offer and , above all , explore your own taste . After you have played Sherlock Holmes for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will be surprised how this activity has intensified your own likes and dislikes . You will have discovered the key to a world of color and design that is delightfully your own . Why not get started today ?  | I am fascinated , and I am sure you must be too , at the almost unbelievably life-likeness of today 's artificial flowers . Even the inexpensive ones have come a long way from the dreadful old-time wax roses . On my fireplace mantel in the living room I have two pots filled with scarlet carnations and crisp white daisies and green leaves ? and I defy anyone to tell them from their reallife counterparts . As in everything else , artificial flowers must be chosen with taste , and they should be used with real leaves . Care should be taken on mixing colors and varieties . Try for the most convincing make-believes . Some are better than others . But do use them to balance a color theme . You often need just a touch of crimson or a spot of acrid yellow , and many times flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall spires of delphinium or blossomed spikes of gladiolus can give a color lift to your room . If real flowers are expensive or scarce in your vicinity , do experiment with these new man-made wonders ! Recently a letter came to my desk from a woman who is a Navy wife , and her advice seemed so sound I thought it worthwhile passing on to you . " Sometimes you might give some pointers to Service folk who persist in buying up all the frightful brass trays in the Middle East and the worst of modern Chinese rugs and chow benches , and , what I believe are called marriage lamps ! " I realize that it is a temptation to pick up things hither and yon , especially when they are inexpensive , but a word of advice from an authority , like yourself , might set them on the right path .  | " Personally , my advice is to buy one nice , good item which is typical of the country . For example , the excellent wood carvings from Portugal , the ceramics from Denmark or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc . " Interesting , is n't it ? And worth remembering if you 're a collector , even if you are n't in the Service ! When the hickory-dickory-dock mouse ran up the clock , he showed good taste . Clocks are probably the most interesting decorative piece you can find . They seem to give a room a pleasant homey look whether the clock is ticking away the hours or just hanging placidly and decoratively still on the wall . Whenever your wall needs something and you do n't know just what , try a clock ! Do n't buy the first one you see , but make a collector 's game of it and you 'll probably come home with one for the living room and one for the hall . Secondhand shops , antique nookeries , attics , and stores should yield up an interesting crop of clocks . An electric clock in a bright canary yellow or dangersignal-red or a gentle aqua may be just what that colorstarved spot in your kitchen has been clamoring for . Then there are the new big electric time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with provincial charm and made out of rich cherry . Another in the contemporary mold and made of walnut would add a special something to any wall . Both had shiny brass pendulums to add a swinging sparkle to a drab wall . Do n't think of a clock as just a timepiece . Make it work for your room ! Just as it seems to be the year for the all " one look " in the fashion world with matching suit , shoes , hat , and  | gloves , the " one look " in home furnishings seems to be luring people to try it for a change . This is especially true in the world of sheets , towels , rugs , etc . And what an array to choose from ! These should inspire you ? printed summer blankets , cotton coverlets with loop fringe , polished cotton dust ruffles , printed sheets and panelprinted pillow cases , gay cotton terry towels with fringed edges , hand towels , face cloths , tub mats , bath and bedroom rugs , and lid covers ? all with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one look . " Of course , you can mix any of these with plain colors for variety , but if you want your bath or bedroom to remind you of the flower garden you never were able to produce ? try this new " one look " for flowers that will bloom on and on and tint your every morning with a rosy outlook . Though it may not be Thanksgiving time , what is it that gives any bountiful board a spot of color ? It 's the cranberry sauce ? that lively spot of juicy rosy-red berries ! " Cranberry " has become one of the favorite colors both in the fashion world and the world of decoration . It seems to be a favorite for those who have shied away from the fireengine red and yet felt the need of that special something that only red can bring to a room . Used with frosty-white it reminds us of the story of Snow White and Rose Red , and the effect of the two is as happy as any ending to a fairy tale . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it around as unexpected accents in an otherwise subdued room . Try it with pastel blue mist , slate blue , green olive , sagebrush , periwinkle , bronze green and see what a " My , oh my ! " room you 'll create . You might like to go " all out " and have cranberry walls ,  | white draperies , sofa in a cranberry , white , and black documentary print , chairs in white or a black and white stripe , and rug in a cranberry and black tweed . All lamps and shades , snowy white . Or in a bedroom you might enjoy waking up to a cranberry rug , white-white walls , crisp cranberry-striped curtains and dust ruffle and a white bedspread . A lamp of cranberry glass and a cranberry decanter would complete the picture . Do try a " helping " of this pungent new color . You 'll love it ! Walking through a store the other day I noticed a large sign which promised " New Life " for your face . It said the cream , or whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now , I thought to myself , is n't that just what most of our houses need at this time of year ? new li f e ? something to awaken our rooms from that same old look they have worn the last few years . You do n't have to dash out and put down a payment on a new sofa or get rid of your coffee table . But how about a fresh new paint color ? something that will make your friends say , " Why Mary , it does n't look like you . " And you can say right back , " I 'm tired of having my rooms look like me , and I feel like a different person every time I walk into this room . " So there ! New slipcovers , some of them with exotic floral patterns can give " New Life " to a room , or how about stripes ? I bet you have n't had anything with stripes for years . I notice that several of the western decorators have gone in for stripes and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stripe " fan ! ) Cover one whole wall with pictures . That will make your room sit up and take notice .  | Change your furniture around . Buy a new olive-green tablecloth and use some persimmon-red napkins with it . It 's time to get some " New Life " into your room . Time to wake them up ! It 's bound to do something for you too ! Want to know how to make your home more inviting for you and your friends ? Here are a few ideas I picked up last week : Tablecloths , oblong , oval , and round in a dozen of the most heavenly shades of linen ( guaranteed fast color ) with a scalloped edge . . . . Did you know that there are wonderful new shapes in bath tubs , made to fit every space ? ... The Knights of the Round Table would certainly feel right at home today . Round tables are everywhere and they do fit in so well for dining or games . . . . Lots of new ideas in a table and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rooms , and just the right size to set down beside a comfortable arm chair . . . . Have you seen the three-shelf window stand for your indoor garden ? It fits double-hung windows without screws or nails . . . . And here 's an idea for you would-beartists ? a mural you can paint yourself by the number method ( easy pattern transfer ) . You can one , two , three with green , white , red , etc. , on everything from a humming bird and branch to a Japanese seaside . Nice for that bare spot over your headboard or that space over the mantel . Tired of your old dining table routine ? Why not get three inexpensive card tables to use separately or as one long table ? . . . And do n't miss the new sofa pillows in every size , shape , and color ! And do n't just read this , try at least one little idea for a house freshener ! Did you ever happen to read this in a little chatter column on fashion ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any well-dressed woman her secret . Lack of clutter , she will say , meaning what to leave off as well as what to put on . Harmony is also a basic element ? the proper balance of your head to your figure via the right hair-do or the right hat , the latter matching perfectly or adding a bright note of contrast . Harmony is the total effect of interesting , becoming colors , textures , and pleasing accessories . " Apply that to your rooms and you have the secret of an inviting house . Nothing detracts from a room like " clutter . " Too much of anything is the beginning of a mess . Study the Japanese . Although we would n't be happy with such sparseness of " things " notice how serene and tidy their rooms are , letting each piece show off its lines in a setting of simplicity . Lamp shades are like hats . A peanut-sized one on an oversized base looks as weird as a pill box on a large moonfaced woman . Fashions and furnishings have a lot in common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the total effect of interesting , becoming colors , textures , and pleasing accessories . " You have the secret , now it 's up to you ! How many times have we said it ? At least a hundred or more ! So it was like meeting an old friend the other day when I saw the heading , " Little things mean a lot ! " They enlarged it in the copy to , " Little things can achieve so much . " Then they went on to sell their own particular product , which happened to be apartment-sized convertibles . ( From sofa to bed . ) They invited you to " arrange two apartment-sized convertibles to face each other in front of a fireplace and suddenly you have created a warm , welcoming setting . So nice to live with , to come home to . " It made an attractive picture and certainly would solve the seating problem . But to get back to the little things that  | mean a lot . So many young people just starting out with their first home think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little things that make the big difference . It is the bowl of purple lilacs in the spring , the basket of red yarn on the table , the choice of lamp and shade , the placement of pictures , the collection of personal mementoes that breathe life into any picture of a home . If you 're planning a new house or a doing over of your old one , remember it 's " the little things that mean a lot ! " Why wait to decorate ? You probably wo n't have any more money next month than you have this . And there will always be only sixty seconds in a minute whether it 's this year or next , so you might as well take the time now to choose a color scheme and get started . It 's a marvelous way to oust that pent-up boredom . Play you are an artist and create a room you have always wanted , something happy and colorful , different from anything you have ever had . If you have been dramatic in your room treatment in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Paint your room one of the tingling new colors , or paper it in a wallpaper that will make you feel as fresh as a daisy . Why wait ? Decorate now ! Having just come back from a short house-viewing trip I have come to this conclusion ? we are n't using enough plants in our homes . Not only do they contribute a decorative distinction , but they provide greenery that is healthy to have around us in the winter , with all the radiators sending out enough heat waves to create a Sahara desert on our skins . Tall plants make attractive room dividers , and a row of lofty red geraniums on a window sill can serve as a screen from an outsider 's roving eye . Those wide-spreading , spikey ,  | old-fashioned Boston ferns are back in favor ( both real and fake ones ) , and ensconced in an interesting pot or container they prove a worthy green fill-in for an empty space . We have mentioned bringing in real branches and using them as a background for artificial birds , flowers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt and top it with white pebbles , the branches become twice as effective , but you also can trap them simply in a stone jar or crock . Use these in a corner beside the piano or as a separation from one level to another . If you are a member of the African violet clan , mass them in groups or march them single file across a window sill . Pink or white begonias can help your color scheme , and do n't miss the hot pink cyclamen for a concentrated batch of color . Make this your personal " more plants in the house " year and enjoy the fruits of your labor ! There 's a certain time of year when every business is engaged in that check-over called " inventory . " And so it seems like a good idea for us to get into the act and do a little stock-taking of our own . Let 's begin with the hall . What have you done in the last two years to make this introduction to your house look more inviting ? You could use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . And how about a group of pictures there ? You 've had those same curtains at the dining room windows for years . Why do n't you shop around for something that will give the room a fresh new look ? Make some cafe curtains and dress them up with an alluring fringe that will sway in the breeze . And why not paint that anemic-looking  | ceiling an airy sky-blue to match the flowers in the wall-paper ? And what about the kitchen ? You spend so much time there but does it remind you of spicy hot ginger cookies and a glass of cold milk ? No ! It looks functional but not homey . You need some cheerful stripes , plaids , or prints at the windows , a bowl of juicy fruit , some gay prints on the wall , and new cushions on those cold plastic chair seats . Yes , it 's time to take inventory and to decide to make color pay off this year ! Once upon a time we bought living room furniture made for the living room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and bedroom sets that had " bedroom " stamped all over them . Not so today ! We are living in a functional and versatile age and the furniture is being designed accordingly . Practically any piece can go anywhere and does ! I have seen , for example , a " modern interpretation of British officers ' campaign furniture , " and it is amazing how " for today " it is , and how easily it can be adapted to the expanding needs of a family . There were desks that could serve as tables , chests that could double for buffets ( and yet hold all your husband 's shirts and socks in the deep drawer space ) , more desks that you could use as dressing or card tables , and some with a stack unit on top for books and bibelots . Then there was a twin bed with trundle bed underneath , and beside it an interesting-looking low piece called a " cargo chest " ? and all of solid oak construction with mar-resistant tops and shiny rectangular brass handles . We certainly are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were bought for a certain spot  | and sat there in their stuffy complacency for the rest of their life . How much more fun and how stimulating to be able to change things around once in a while . Do n't let you or your furniture get into a rut ! The tortoise has just won another race ! The color of its shell is first on the list of a practical new decorating theme , and from vinyl floor coverings to upholstery and wall coverings it 's on the move ! With a little stretch of the imagination it includes the new Java brown , sunflower , mandarin orange , maple sugar , black pearl , expresso , and curry , to mention just a few of the colors used in this new concept . You can see what possibilities there are in this batch of colors . Say you paint your walls a spicy curry . Cover the sofa in a black and curry crewel design and have two chairs in a black tweed . A pair of small chairs could be in sunflower and there could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ash tray . Or if you are the do-it-yourself professional , you might try covering an old piece of furniture with self-adhesive paper in the tortoise-shell vein . Or cover a screen or a divider with it to give your room that new look . All sorts of table linen , china , and glassware come in these new hues ? black , brown , and amber ? which are especially good at the harvest time of year . It offers a whole new palette to work with , and if you have n't tried black and brown with a few sunshiny touches , you 're in for a real tortoise treat . The National Home Improvement Council has designated this as Home Improvement Year , and I do hope you are impressed with the idea of a national home improvement  | council . Perhaps you can establish one on a more personal basis , and you and your family can have a meeting to decide what needs to be done with the interior of your house . Such " togetherness " should result in some original ideas and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in whether to paint the living room olive green or Bristol blue . Every home needs an improvement council . There comes a time when slipcovers wear out , curtains droop , floors need scraping , and if only Mom is in there pitching for a refurbishing job , it 's hard going ! But if the family would have a meeting and " everybody get into the act , " it might prove a little hectic but at least it would produce results . A good idea would be to have a list made out before the meeting . Half the time the other members of the family are so busy with all of their own personal activities they have n't noticed that the edges of the rug are worn or that the curtains are faded . But just wait until they want to invite some friends in , then all of a sudden they expect miracles . Have that meeting today ! Today when you " pull up a chair " it could come from anywhere . I 've never seen such a variety as we have to choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a curved back , a Spanish black-leather folding side chair , a gilt-color wrought-iron side chair from Italy , or an arm chair with a rush seat from that same country . There are Spanish side chairs with leather seats ( leather is making a big come-back this year ) and a sturdy English Windsor arm chair , as well as a squat French provincial arm chair and a rush-seat chair from Mexico . The idea of buying a sofa and two chairs to match has vanished with the feather boa . Of course , you must keep the rest of your furnishings in mind when buying your chairs .  | Not that everything has to match , but there is the question of proportion and balance . For instance , a whale of a big sofa , not only wide and cushiony but stretching from here to there , calls for more than two spindly chairs flanking it . Occasional chair seats can pick up a color in your room and toss back a charming accent . This is especially smart with the current idea of doing a room in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " pull-up " chair , be adventuresome , try something new and different . From Spain , maybe ? Even if you 're in a part of the country that does n't have blizzards and cold north winds , you know by the calendar when it 's winter time , so here are few suggestions or " winter warm-up " ideas that would be welcome anywhere I 'm sure . Felt drapes so beautifully and has such a smooth cat-like texture that it 's extra good news to hear that you can now buy ready-made felt covers to fit practically any type bed or couch and with dust ruffles , zippered pillow covers , valances , and draperies to match . They come in eighteen mouth-watering colors and are just what the doctor ordered for winterweary rooms . Have you ever curled your toes around one of those highpile acrylic scatter rugs ? Ummmm ! They feel like fur but are machine washable and the colors would make any bedside or bathroom think spring is here . Show off a black and white chess set on a small table for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a set of mock-tortoise folding snack tables ( tortoise pattern with vinyl tops ) and see how elegant your meat loaf will look !  | Cover one piece of furniture in the new fabric with an animal look to satisfy your primitive instincts and to give a room a " my own " identification . Warm up winter with some new ideas . Be creative ! There 's a season for everything and this may be the season for examination of your budgets ? dreary word , is n't it ? Have you thought about your household budget ? What are you going to spend your money on this year ? Be very business-like about this . Go through your house , room by room , pencil and pad in hand and make a list of what you absolutely need . If you have a pretty tight budget ( as most of us do these days ) , try to use it on the little things that will count most in your room . If you can get by with the old sofa for another year , dress it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a sprightly geometric design and nobody will notice that comfortable sag in the left-hand corner . New draperies bring a fresh as a daisy look into a room , and , of course , no budget would be complete without including a dab of paint to brighten a whole room , the doors , or even a piece of furniture . We all have accessories we would n't get rid of for the world , but there are some that could go without a sigh , and a few gay new ideas sprinkled around is a refreshing sight to both " inmates " and visitors . If your bathroom towels have that dingy last-year look , here is a good place to toss in some garden-fresh colors and wear down a bit of that budget . Try some new throw rugs for brilliant patches of color . Get a new color scheme for the kitchen . Wangle a new bedspread ! Color is the budget 's best friend ! Let it work for you !  | Music is everywhere today . You hear it on the buses from the tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stereo , a home without music is like a ship without a rudder ? it just wo n't do ! Cabinets to store records have become as necessary a piece of furniture as a bookcase . Manufacturers even have partitioned low cabinets to provide special stack-on units for children 's records . Have you seen the record cabinets that double as chairside or sofa tables to hold lamps and plants ? Or have you seen the cabinet that is tall and used as a room divider ? With the folk-singing craze there has come a great resurgence of would-be guitar players . Hung on the wall of a boy 's room with some framed guitar music , a guitar provides you with a made-to-order wall decoration as well as a good place to bring the instrument to roost when not " in twang . " Why not create a small musical corner in your living room or family room ? To slightly alter a well-known phrase , " The family who plays together , stays together . " So let there be music , even if we all turn out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room for boys the other day that would make your mouth water it was so alive , sunny , and practical . Somehow we think of boy 's colors as red , white , or blue , maybe green . But this was different ! The walls were papered in a strikingly brilliant orange , brown , and yellow striped wallpaper . Two bunk beds were covered with sunflower-yellow textured covers . The rug was sunflower yellow and there were two comfortable chairs with orange coverings . Two small wooden chair painted a bright orange sat at attention at the twin desks . Prints of old cars were massed all around the room in simple black frames . ( Good suggestion for mothers who are always asking what they can put on the wall of a boy 's room. )  | The desks were simple affairs , but it was the attention to inexpensive details that made them important . On each desk sat an ordinary ruled pad , but yellow , and each desk was equipped with a yellow ceramic dish filled with a bunch of all yellow pencils . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get color with little things . And do n't say sunflower yellow is n't practical because today with all the washable fabrics and stain-resistant rugs , etc. , it 's just as practical as that gray of yours , and much happier to live with ! Black pepper can make all the difference in the world to a gourmet dish . It adds the necessary zing that attracts your appetite . And black can do the same for a room , but how many of you use it ? You do n't have to drape your rooms in mourning , but black or black and white touches are the answer when you do n't know what else to use and you realize your room is drooping its colors . Now they have crisp white sheets and pillow cases with black polka dots and white sheets with black scroll-like designs . In a boy 's room with red walls they may be used as curtains and spreads with very up-and-coming results . Cafe curtains edged with fat ball fringe in black provide a good pick-up treatment for a girl 's room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And a coal-black pillow tossed in with your hot pinks and Bristol blues makes them look all the brighter . Then there are all the shiny black accessories that add their own punch to an otherwise namby-pamby decor ? the black Bristol vases , cigarette boxes , canisters , candlesticks , tissue boxes , towel racks , towels and rugs , bath curtains , and bath mats .  | Nothing helps to punctuate the meaning of a room more than a careful spilling of black here and there . Be " pastel people " if that is your choice , but just as you might like to try a plump licorice gum drop in between bonbons , try something black for a change ! You can always be something of an architect with your paint . One trick is to paint the reveals of your windows a different color from the walls . In a charcoal-gray room , for instance , you could paint them white and thus give depth to the window and an impression of more light . The Orient has always been a place of mystery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some time . But how many of us can make the trip there ? It 's hardly necessary today because , since we could n't go to the Orient , like Mohammed and the mountain , the Orient has come to us . Everywhere you look today you see rooms decorated with the flavor of the Orient ? in furniture , with its typical squaredoff Oriental handles on chests , ornate lanterns , and what not . And the other day in one of our large stores , while escalating to a higher region , I saw what looked like an entire segment of Chinatown occupying one whole corner of that floor . Everything was brilliant red ( that special Chinese lacquer red ) and gold . Tea sets , wallpaper , wastebaskets , shelves , ornamental lanterns , chairs , screens , scrolls , stools . Mixed in with the red were some black and gold lacquer items , complete with dragons and flowers . Lots of bamboo and painted wicker too . Why not mix a little of the mystical Orient in with your rock-bound early Americana ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring back Chinese pieces to blend with  | their Sheraton and Hepplewhite chairs in the great houses . Try a bit of blending of East and West to prove that " the twain " have met and all is harmony ! What do you think of when you hear the word " glass " ? A window perhaps , or a receptacle for beverages ? Pretty limited when you see all the modern uses of the different kinds of glass for today 's home . Just think ! You can have squares of translucent panels where light can be shared by two rooms . And you can have horizontal fluted panels to let the light in and yet keep your privacy . Or patterned glass used as room dividers brightens a dark corner . And there is a special kind of patterned glass that makes shimmering shadows when used as the back of a cabinet or to show off objets d'art in a viewless window . A ribbed glass table top is practical and gives a light touch where it is needed . Sliding cabinet doors of glass go with any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And a glass shelf or a series of glass shelves in a window filled with glass containers of many hues can turn it into a window of almost stained-glass beauty , with its ruby reds , emerald greens , and sapphire blues . If you plan to build or remodel or just want one new idea to spark up a room or hallway , think of glass . It 's worth looking into ? and I do n't mean a mirror ! " Eeny-meeny-miney-mo " ! That 's the children 's method of choosing whatever it happens to be ? sides , chocolates , turns ! It 's fun , and so today for your house , here are some " eeny-meeny-miney-mo ideas " for you to pick and choose from . Scenic fabric used as a mural . A honeycomb of diamondshaped box-like openings to hold your logs beside the fire- place . Try a bathroom with light blue walls and emeraldgreen accessories . Get one of the new brilliant rugs with the giant-sized tassels . Use a scenic window shade for the viewless window . Decorate a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design , framed with molding . A cute idea for a child 's room is to have two open slatted closets filled with toy animals ( looking-out-of-a-cage effect ) and making a practical cupboard for all other toys . If you are buying your rug by the square feet , and it 's one of the new extra-pretty decorative ones , buy a little extra for chair seats to recover your dining room chairs . More and more indoor trellis effects are being used . For a Mr. and Mrs. bedroom : if you have a long wall , place your twin beds along the wall , facing each other . Frees the rest of the room for a living room look . And now " eenymeeny-miney-mo , " which idea or ideas will you choose ? Time was when window shades were either cream , white , or green and they pulled down from the top and that was it ! But just look at what we have to choose from today ! Candy stripes , embroidered lawn , a flecked texture called " Boucle weave , " a puckered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nubby linen-and-cotton weave , shantung shades , baroque shades which have an all-over design printed on percale , to mention just a few . And just think of all the installations you have : bottom-up installation , up-and-down installation , slanted window treatment , shades which conceal flush air conditioner units , etc . If you have two windows close together you can treat them as one with a wide window shade across the whole business . Or if you 're the imaginative type , you can use a decorative window shade on the French doors , as a room divider in  | wooden frames , or to cover closet shelves that have a habit of looking untidy no matter how neat you may be . As if that all was n't enough , and you 're a born matchmaker , now you can get fabric and wallpaper designs reproduced indelibly on vinyl-impregnated shade cloth . Even the lollipop set has n't been forgotten , and there are shades with tumbling nursery characters that are lightproof , flame-resistant ? and pretty ! If you have n't thought about the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is the time ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Some people seem to think that desks belong to offices and never dream about using one in a home . Yet not only do desks make an interesting looking addition to the standard sofa and chair set-up , but they are about the most practical invention since the wheel . And what varieties are available today ! There are desks with plastic tops for young scholars , stately secretaries for added storage space , table desks with marble , leather or matched parquet tops , and some with brass gallery details . There 's a desk for every period , contemporary , traditional , colonial , and French or Italian provincial . It gives you a neat and orderly feeling to sit down at a desk and write a letter or balance a stubborn checkbook . And one of the new good-looking ones can do so much for a room . The unpainted models are inexpensive ( as desks go ) and painted black or an antique green or red , with their brass hardware , or finished off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the answer to what to put in that special empty spot . There are all different kinds of desks with different kinds of uses for different kinds of people , so why not go desk-hunting for your next project ? You 'll be glad you did !  | On blustery February days it 's a good idea to try to do something constructive instead of sitting around waiting for the first pussywillow to sprout . And a better idea than cutting out paper dolls is to get a few rolls of that self-adhesive plastic and go to work on a little rejuvenating project of your own . As you know , you do n't need any messy paste or glue , just cut and apply . The patterns and colors are designed to please both the timid and the bold , so ask to see them all . You can get this self-adhesive plastic in rolls of 18 inches wide or 36 inches wide . With the 18-inch size why not do over a few of those rusty old trays that you were going to discard ? Or create a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jaded canister set ? Or revitalize an aged-beige parchment lamp shade ? Or sparkle your pantry shelves ? With the 36-inch width you can redo a floor , cover counter tops , spruce up a bar or put a marbleized top on an old table . You 'll get a strong durable covering that protects as it decorates . There 's an idea for you that you wo n't have to float a loan to put into action , and wait until you see how it seems to bring the freshness of springtime that much closer ! What with ladies donning long skirts ( which many whip up for themselves on their sewing machine ) for a quiet dinner at home , or for an evening of bridge , there 's bound to be a return of the more romantic mood . And what better way to create the aura of romance or just gentle relaxation than candlelight ? If all women could realize what candlelight does to their faces , there would n't be enough candles to go around . A dark forest-green tablecloth , snow-white china and a candelabra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had worn that long hostess skirt to the party . Candles are a wonderful way to spot a certain corner with just the color you want . Today they come in not only every color of the rainbow , but many nature has never even thought of . In one room with two hot-pink pillows , a hostess I know racked her brains on how to get another spot of that hot-pink in the room . Then she hit upon the idea of placing two hot-pink candles in snow-white candlesticks , and that did the trick to perfection . Black candles in shiny brass candlesticks give a strikingly dramatic punch to the top of a white mantel . And do n't just stick the candles in their containers and let them gather dust . Light them . Enjoy them . Let them work their enchantment on your room ! With the Regency spirit being injected into about everything these days there is bound to be a trace of elegance in even the most simply planned decorating scheme . And nothing can add that small dollop of elegance like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impractical " until you have read the labels on the new nylon velvets . They are " practically " as practical as gingham and , like a pinch of curry in a ragout , make all the difference in the world . In dreamy fantastic colors which only velvet can produce , you can cover a small love seat , use it for toss pillows , line a china cupboard , trim it with fringe and use it as a Victorian table cover , mat a picture , or cushion a bench . Any way you use it , you 'll find that velvet offers its own individual oomph to a room . Two little fruitwood chairs covered in lemon-peel yellow velvet can shake any room out of the doldrums . And a cardi- nal-red dust ruffle of velvet can give a snow-white bedspread a regal look fit for a king ? or a husband . Try a touch of velvet for that touch of elegance you may not have missed in the past but will more than appreciate in the future . If you 're the right kind of guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of a **26;1733;TOOLONG gift . To be on the safe side , bring her something for the house rather than a personal gift . Here are a few summer suggestions which should insure another invitation : A set of four ( or eight , if you 're richer ) of sea-going place mats , colorful coastal charts of various regions of the country , vinyl-coated for practicality . . . . Patio candles in translucent wax shells in the shape of a ball or cylinder in red and yellow or green and yellow , with replaceable candles that last for eight hours . . . . Table gifts with an Oriental flavor ? a pair of baby solid brass quail which according to an old Chinese tradition promises " ever-abundance on your table . " ... Silver or templegold color butterflies ( for happiness ) to hold napkins , etc . . . . A couple of the thirsty terry towels in the new wild , wild rose pattern . . . . A set of plastic coat hangers in pink , blue , yellow , aqua , or green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . A set of electrified , flameproof , weatherproof , and welcome-proof Japanese patio lanterns in radiant firefly colors to plug in and festoon across your terrace or sprinkle among your trees . Do n't just run out and get a box of soap or a bottle at the last minute . Give your hostess gift some thought . She and her house will say , " Thank you , " and you 'll get asked again ! Did you know that one tiny chipmunk can cause a lot of damage if he gets into a house ? And think of what one  | little moth can do to an expensive winter coat ! Never underestimate the power of the little things in life ! The little touches you tuck in around your home are what give it personality and charm . I call them the " you " touches , because each person has a different way of doing things . ( Thank goodness ! ) If you ca n't afford to repaint your whole room , why not paper one wall in one of those expensive wallpaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your bed begins to look cracked and faded , why not give it a wake-up dab of shiny black or the whitest of white paint ? A whole new covy of inexpensive pictures can freshen up a wall . Try some new accessories ! Everybody has grown too used to the same old cigarette box , ash tray , flowers arranged the same way in the same bowl in the same spot . Startle your next visitor with something different , no matter how small . It may be a tiny ceramic dog nestling on a blue satin pillow , or a small hibachi for individual hot hors d'oeuvres or a centerpiece made from a crooked piece of red cedar and decorated with can't-tell-it-from-real ivy , bittersweet berries , and tiny make-believe birds . Try some little changes . They can make a big difference ! Do you play the piano ? When your fingers are drifting over the keys , do n't those staccato notes sort of stab you into consciousness ? Well , we 're giving out a few short staccato notes that may inspire you or at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know that now you can have sliding mirror doors ? Mobile mirrors are easily installed and are removable ( though why you would want to remove them I do n't see ! ) ... Have you spotted the new desk-and-shelf unit that can be changed in height or moved from room to room ? It con- sists of two adjustable poles , two shelves ( 9 x 34 inches ) desk ( 18 x 34 x 6 inches ) and an adjustable lamp with cord and shade . . . . Have you been fascinated by theatre make-up mirrors with their three-way mirrors and light bulbs outlining the edge . They are now being made to fit your own dressing table . Why not try this shadowless glamor-maker for your bedroom ? . . . Colorful scenic place mats of Trafalgar Square , changing of the guard , Montmartre , Moulin Rouge , Trevi Fountain , Rome , and the Grand Canal etc. , are pretty enough to frame and are bound to lend an international air to anybody 's mashed potatoes . . . . A red , green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table into a real color asset . Pretty flowered sheets that are worn out in places make wonderful nighties for little girls and their dolls . Hope you wo n't wait too long to try one of these short notes ! Are you the type of person who thinks windows are just something put there to make women worry about what kind of a curtain to use ? Do n't you know that the type of windows you have and what curtains or window treatment you concoct can change the looks of your whole room ? Say you have a wall-to-wall curtain , you can set the theme of your room by the fabric you choose . A printed fabric does one thing , a bold floral adds something else ; sophisticated plain textured folds contribute their own special brand of individualism . Use a cornice or a swag over a curtain , or a combination of elaborate window shades and draperies and see what a transformation you can bring to the same window . Changing from ruffled tie-backs to cafe curtains with brass rings can take the Priscilla out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ball fringe , braid , moss fringe , ornamental  | tassels can make a plain old everyday curtain take on a new glamor . Shutters and tall screens and built-in nooks of plywood can correct some of the architectural mistakes that seemed inevitable in many of the old apartment houses and homes . Take another good look at the windows in your house . Why not try some new treatment , some new fabric ? I never have been one to worry about " what goes with what . " My theory has always been , " If it looks right , it is right . " So I was most interested to hear that a noted painter and art critic had said , " Taste and fashion change , but there is nothing more tasteful by today 's standards than the very kind of mixing of style in furniture and works of art which the timid fear . " It seems he likes to put abstract paintings in an eighteenth-century room and scandalized many by filling an ultramodern room with antique and primitive paintings and sculpture . If the colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ? All this worrying and fussing about whether one can use a Danish modern chair with a Boston rocker in the room , or a four-poster bed with a modern area rug seems so silly . The question is , how do they look together in your room ? Do you like it ? If you are uncomfortable , uneasy , or apologetic about the combination , better do something else ! It 's true , some people have a knack of putting " this with that " and making it look attractive . They may have no reason to give you , but it just seemed like the natural thing to do . These are the people whose houses wear an attractive and individual aura of charm . For those without that knack , stop , look , and listen , and before you know it , you 'll be " mixing " with the best of them !  | I saw a phrase the other day that caught my eye . The words that came before it described a picture , and said , " The ornaments are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep . " Right there is a good lesson for all of us . If you are going to have bric-a-brac around ( and I 'm all for it ) make it earn its keep ! Let a flower-garlanded or striped dish become a soap container for the bathroom . Do n't just line up a row of apothecary jars and let them stand empty . Fill them with gay toilet soap , pastel cotton puffs , or amber cologne . A gay old pin cushion on a night table should n't be just an ornament . It should be equipped with practical threaded needles and pins . Why not use the old white ironstone washbowl for a sizable salad bowl , and fill the tall pitcher that goes with it full of crisp rhododendron leaves ? Get out that wonderful antique turkey red and white bedspread and use it as a tablecloth . The fringe would be an added attraction . And with white china it could be quite a conversation piece . For the centerpiece you might have a white tureen filled with fruit , with a festoon of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a semi-circle of white ironstone egg cups , pressed into service as candle holders ( candles are made to stick with their own melted wax ) you 'll have a table that will be fun to set and fun to sit at ! Put everything to work and do n't think anything is too good to use . Make everything earn its keep ! Did you happen to see that ad , " Three rooms with a well-kept secret " ? I thought it a very clever way to show how a convertible could be used in three different types of living rooms . No one would ever guess that the three elegantlooking sofas could ever be transformed into anything as  | lowly and practical as a bed . But that 's what the ad was all about . One room was sort of modern , the other was French provincial in feeling , and the third had distinct Oriental overtones , with its rolled bolsters and two low square coffee tables in front of it . These examples seemed to have come a long way from the old-time sofa-bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a good idea to pick your convertible first and decorate your room around it . With hundreds of models to choose from you are bound to produce an original effect . Sometimes one thing , like a sofa , can inspire the whole decor of a room . For an apartment , den , or study these convertibles are the perfect answer , and you can " live graciously , live spaciously , even in one room . " So why not have a room " with a well-kept secret " and do n't divulge it until the night somebody misses the train . Then spring the surprise and let the compliments fall where they may . It 's worth looking into , if you are planning on buying a new sofa in the " pretty soon " era . Remember Jimmy Cagney in the movies ? I read a piece about his sister , Jeanne Cagney , the other day , and speaking about her home life , she described her farm-house home in Benedict Canyon out Beverly Hills way as " Early American Livable . " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home ? Whether your house is early American or modern walls of glass and sliding doors , the important thing is to make it livable , and what are the things that contribute to a livable house ? Well , color , warm , vibrant color in paint or wallpaper can immediately set the right note . Comfortable chairs , grouped for easy conversation , with ash trays handy and soft lights agreeably placed , a sofa , with pillows that can be  | shoved around for individual convenience , a coffee table large enough to hold a tea tray , a tray of glasses and hors d'oeuvres , pictures that help to add a personal touch to the walls ? these are a few of the things that make a room livable . A television set that may be rolled into the dining room or to the foot of the bed to catch the late show . A good-sized night table to hold your current book , a carafe of water , glasses , pills , etc . And rugs that add color to a room instead of just serving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a livable house . Look around your rooms . What can you do to make your home more livable . Have you ever thought what a difference a change of drawer pulls can make in a chest ? You can cast an Oriental look on a plain chest by just changing the drawer handles . Or try a solid brass light switch plate to dress up that corner where the old chrome one used to be . Drapery tie-backs , say in a pretty fleur-de-lis design , can lend even the simplest curtain treatment a dash of elegance . Then there are the new decorative rings to show off today 's flower garden towels . A black lacquer door with a fancy shiny knob reminds us of those magic words " Open Sesame , " and we 're sure there must be all kinds of exciting decorative goodies waiting once that door is opened . An original knocker on the front door sets the mood of the house . One creative friend of mine uses an old-fashioned wooden lemon squeezer as a knocker in her powder room in the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation piece . Try something new in the way of hardware ! You 'll love the glisten brass will bring into your home . And watch it sparkle  | when it greets the flicker of candlelight or the flame from your fire . With headboards of solid brass , quilted headboards and spreads to match , coverlets as gay as a Strauss waltz , and embroidered canopy ensembles , there 's no reason in the world for anyone to say , " Now I lay me down to sleep " in just any old bed . Even if your mattresses are in good condition , why not change your headboard ? It will give your bedroom a completely new look . And for those who have long cherished the idea of a bedspread and canopy to match but for whom it always looked like too much work , you now can buy the ensemble in charming , crisp , fresh cotton , all machine washable and drip dry . A young friend of mine had bought some inexpensive maple beds . Placed right near the windows , the wood or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the headboards a shiny black and put a tailored cover of big oversized black and white checks on the bed and used the same fabric for curtains . With tulip red touches around , her room suddenly blossomed out in a style just right for her vivacious personality . Be a modern Goldilocks and see which type of bed is " just right " for you ? then do something about making it as pretty as a story-book picture ! Have you ever been to Mexico ? Some people love it , some are disappointed with it , but everyone agrees that it is a land of exciting color and an ever-spurting font of inspiration for designers . To sort of make up to the people who have never been south of the border , now you can nudge the feeling of old  | Mexico into your rooms with gracious ease . A whole new line of coordinated stripes and solids has been dreamed up to introduce that different look to your own hacienda . Washable and woven of preshrunk cotton you can give your room a spicey chili-powder treatment with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brown , or copper . Not only can you get studio covers , Hollywood covers , pillow covers , bolster covers , but cafe curtains , draperies , valances , and twin spreads . You can be as stripey as a zebra or use a combination of stripes and solids . And just imagine how wonderful it is to find something different , all complete with curtains and pillow covers ! So put on your sombrero and get out your Mexican jumping beans and hop right out to investigate these Aztec ensembles ! ( Look at the painted chairs too ! ) Have you ever noticed how a zebra-striped scarf or a sizzling red hat can change a drab , uninteresting costume into a real eye-catcher ? Well , a change of slipcovers can do the same thing for an anemic-looking room . And if it 's spring , there 's nothing that will spark up a winter-weary room like new slipcovers . This year they are as color delectable as a fresh-picked strawberry covered with dew . There are brilliant tropical flowers on a striped background , stylized plaids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splashes of exotic blossoms reminiscent of Gauguin " and enchanting " Floral fantasies on a cross-hatch background . " There are florals , colonial and provincial prints and coordinated solid tones in cotton antique satin and tweed cottons . And if you ca n't find something just right for your  | living room , you 're not only color blind , but lacking in imagination . So do give your room the " sizzling red hat " treatment and wake up the possibilities you never realized you had . It wo n't only effect your room , watch what it can do for you ! When we think of decorating a house or apartment , we usually have in mind slipcovers , draperies , color of the walls , etc . But have you ever thought of " wood " as a partner in your decorating scheme ? A wide panel of redwood in a living room can change your whole decorating outlook . A wall of antiqued pine can transform your fireplace into a conversation piece . Birchwood cabinets march into your kitchen creating an amazing contrast to your painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a boy 's room or study . And a scalloped cornice hugging the top of the wall over the bathtub and hiding the top of your shower curtain dresses up your bathroom ? and it 's such a simple do-it-yourself way of bringing a jolt of individuality into your house . Have you thought of wooden shutters used indoors ? to hide a closet , to outline a window , to screen an architectural defect or some necessary , but where-do-you-put-it object ? Painted to match or contrast with your room , shutters can lift a room right out of the ordinary into the unusual . Then there are the objects made of wood which are becoming so popular in helping to cozy-up walls and tables . Old-fashioned sugar scoops , mortar and pestles , wooden duck decoys , and sculpture made of wood ? all these help to bring a new interest to today 's living . So for something good , try wood !  | While motoring in the country recently , and as always , trying to peer into each house as we flew along , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what kind of people live in a house by the curtains they put at the windows . " There seem to be few happy mediums . There are too skimpy or wispy curtains at long windows or too shrouded a look on small windows . Better to have a couple of pairs of inexpensive curtains at one window than an expensive drapery that makes even the most expansive window look poverishly skimped . A small inconsequential window can " make " a room if it is imaginatively treated , say with a window shade , perhaps with a sprinkling of butterflies , and a piece of fabric , with a butterfly motif made into a swag , carelessly looped over a brass rod , for a topping . A fluff of white tiers at a window makes a little girl feel like a prima donna , and the combination of white shutters and a breezy floral cafe curtain would be a tonic for any room . Become a window watcher and see that your windows are wearing the right style ! No one can say that we Americans are n't internationally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trend , and now , it 's Scandinavia that enters the picture . Does this sound enticing to you ? " Go modern . Go wild with the wonderful ways of the great woods so alive and adventuresome in imports from Scandinavia . Discover veneers in all their glory ? in the potent glow of rosewood , rare , richly grained and butter-smooth . Or take teak . Better yet , let teak take you ? lead you to dreams of lands of spice and cinnamon etc. etc . " This juicy ad hardly seems necessary ? with the way  | the young people have taken to the pieces from Norway , Sweden , and Denmark . There is something " young " in the very smooth and cleancut lines of the chairs from Norway with their combination of teak and leather . The dining tables , sideboards , and chairs from Denmark have a fresh " tomorrow " look and fit in so well with that first apartment or the first small home . And the satiny teak wall units from Sweden look vitally substantial enough to accompany any young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rope seat would be for those who like the unusual . If you ca n't manage a trip to the Scandinavian countries ( a nice dream ) , do by all means take a trip to your largest department store and admire " the dash and dare " of vigorous new designs . It 's an inspiration ! Let me see , what 's new today ? Have you seen the wonderful new ready-mades of felt ? Beautifully tailored with jumbo cord welting you can now get covers for a studio couch , Hollywood bed , etc. , with pillow covers , bolster covers , cafe curtains and valances , and even a dust ruffle in eighteen flamboyant colors . Have you seen the new vinyl shower curtain in the elegant damask design ? There is a matching drapery for the window and this pair would enhance any down-trodden bathroom . Have you thought of using the globe of the world on an important looking wooden stand as a new accessory ? Have you seen the new pole desk with book trough and straight shelf ? It does n't take up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holder for pen , pencil , and notes . Have you thought of sewing those giant tassels about 10 inches apart to dress up your area rug ? Gives it a whole new look .  | Have you looked lately at the marvelous new print draperies that have a translucent homespun look , wash easily , and dry quickly without ironing ? See " Covent Garden , " a riot of flowers in blue , gold or red on white , or " Reflection , " a toneon-tone in green , blue , beige , or gold on white , or the " Calgary " plaid in brown , gray , beige , or green and blue , orange and gold , red and white . It 's time for new ideas ! If your room is small , eliminate all unnecessary gadgets and try to get the furniture back against the walls . Pieces that jut out into a room and anything placed kittycornered , as they say , takes away from a spacious look . Try to buy furniture scaled for a small room . Do n't go in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat or a small twocushion sofa . White or light-colored walls seem to expand small space , but do n't forget the bright snatches of color to keep the room from going to sleep . Wallpaper can do a lot for a small bathroom or kitchen . It helps furnish , without taking up space . Sometimes a gay painted ceiling can give a small room a little distinction . Hanging shelves and a desk or vanity that fits in a corner are two other suggestions for the small room . But one thing to remember , do n't give your room a small-room complex . Sometimes I like to splash a whopping big pattern on a slipcover in a small room just to give it a feeling of importance . The idea is to " think big " in a small way and your room will be a success ! Remember grab bags when you were children ? Everybody loved the grab bag event . Perhaps it was the element of surprise . Today we have a grab bag of ideas . Which idea will be for you . Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your bathroom door for a series of guest towels , like a flower garden of vivid colors ? The one I saw used three brass curtain rods as towel racks . But the wonderful part of this idea was that just below the towels was a disposal bin made of metal wire , painted gold ? to take care of the problem of what to do with a guest towel after you have used it . Or The Idea of making an espaliered tree from artificial leaves and blossoms . About five tapered " branches " set in the corner of a patio or living room would add a special something . Just twine the artificial leaves and flowers onto five varied lengths of 1-inch dowels and tack to a center vertical dowel , the height you desire . Most ornamental ! And you wo n't have to water it . Or The Idea of using a wicker hamper ( with a plastic pail of water hidden inside ) to hold tall , tall pussy willows or forsythia branches to fill a vacant corner . Or The Idea of using a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitable lamp on table routine . Or The Idea that geraniums make a snappy and invitinglooking centerpiece for your next dinner party . Which idea is for you ? Should your choice of color be influenced by a certain period of furniture ? In a recent letter , a client , with a color problem , wrote , " Since the scheme is traditional I feel orange is too modern . " Is n't that a strange reaction ? I must admit it would never enter my head . If a room needed a spot of pungent orange it would get it , no matter whether the furniture was early or late Whatnot . As a matter of fact , if we must get factual , orange ap- peared in biblical times and was used in the trappings of the early Egyptians . The lady who was worrying about the orange being too modern wanted to use it as an accent color with green olive . It 's a good combination and I advised her to go ahead with her idea . The point I hope to put over is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Can maple be used with pine ? Can you use a modern chair with a spinet in the room ? Is lavender an " old " color ? What difference does it make ? If you like it , and if it looks right , it is right . As to color , it is the most democratic of all decorating aids . It is not " choosy " as to its company . A good color fits in anywhere . I like blues , red , greens , and black and white , and I 'm sure I would never stop and think , " Does red , for instance , go with my Great-grandmother 's desk ? " Do n't be afraid of color ? just see that you use plenty of it ! " A place for everything and everything in its place " was drummed into our childish mind over and over . But the problem today is " where is there a place for everything ? " The answer is built-in storage ! There is a lot of waste space in many rooms and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . In the bedroom , for instance , why not have a series of built-in drawers with louvered-door cabinets above for one wall ? Or divide your closet into built-in open shelves for boxes , purses , shoes , etc. ? A long drawer under the built-in bunk can hold a whole pile of blankets and odds and ends . Space under a kitchen window can become a combination seat with cushion and storage box for boots and galoshes . The kitchen and dining room divider could be a series of open shelves at the top with long cabinets for silver and linen  | below . And a bed in the den could be pushed back under a long bookshelf with cabinets flanking either side , making a comfortable bed for an unexpected guest at night and giving a sofa effect in the daytime . There are dozens of practical ideas in booklets put out by the lumber companies , so contact your local man and make room for everything ! Today " the soft touch " is being emphasized in the cosmetic world and to keep up with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room ? A soft touch or a light touch in a room might be one with soft blue mist walls , curtains in white with soft blue pattern , the same fabric used for the bedspread , and with this , either a soft blue or dove-white rug . Another suggestion might be an all sandy-beige and snowywhite scheme , or a room done in sea-foam green . Or an allwhite room , perhaps with just a splashy bouquet of florescent red carnations to punctuate its whiteness . Or the light touch might mean the way you handle your lamp shades and accessories . Some otherwise " soft touch " rooms wear a heavy-handed look with red or black lamp shades that seem as outlandish there as a real blonde with too much eye make-up . Or all of a sudden you are startled by a lone black-as-night sofa in a room which in every other way is as pastel as a pastoral painting . We like the element of surprise , but not to this extent . It has to be a " black sofa " type of room in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item to be a success . If you decide to give your rooms the light-touch treatment for the summer , do n't spoil the effect with one heavy-handed idea !  | Perhaps it 's a rainy day and you 're thinking how drab your rooms look . You wish you could reach out and pluck a rainbow to stride through the house from kitchen to foyer . Perhaps you can ! Here are a few inexpensive " rainbow " touches that should make you feel a little more cheery . Have you seen the " rainbow system " of wall shelves and cabinets ? Especially good for children 's rooms . They consist of extra-heavy gauge steel precision-made units such as 8-inch wide shelves , magazine rack , utility tray , letter tray , writing surface , drawers , sliding-door cabinet , planter , in black , blue , red , yellow , green or white oven-baked enamel . Each unit comes complete with hanging supports , easy to install . Use them in a " rainbow " combination or all in one color , they put space to work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild ( fabric ) zebra-covered pillow . Use a new " princess " blind for a sheer summer look . The slats are half the size of the conventional venetian blinds and with hairline tapes they can give your window a shimmery new look . Mugs are in ? for coffee , milk , beer , soup , pencils , or in groups of four as a centerpiece filled with flowers or leaves . They come with plaids , flowers , birds , or plain . Treat your " do-over " problems as adventures . Take a do-or-dare attitude and do something that you have never dared before , and get some fun out of it ! Instead of dreading to select new slipcovers or a new window treatment or worrying about what to put on your pride-and-joy 's bed , go out and look at all the mouth-watering fabrics , the new ideas in the stores , and determine that you will try something new and fresh if it 's the last thing you do ! It may be something as simple as substituting a rollicking Roman stripe for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for short , crisp cafe curtains , or just changing the furniture around can give a room a new look . Try your own " adventures in decorating " and do think of it as an adventure and decorate with zest ? not dread ! Recently at a showing of " Young Homemakers " furniture , it was interesting to see the freedom with which they had mixed periods , textures , fabrics . Themes old and new , as they said , were combined to bring the best of contemporary decoration in all its infinite variety . No static staidness here , but a refreshing mingling , which , after all , is the way it should be for young and old homemakers . A French provincial chair sat serenely at a contemporary desk , while in the background was a modern , functional wall unit . Spanish , high-back chairs of fruitwood kept company with a Chinese table of white baked enamel over steel , with a white laminated top . Two black framed and black and white upholstered Louis XV chairs faced a sofa with stainless steel base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the original was the hit of the Paris exhibition in 1900 ) looked comfortably at home next to a modern two-door cabinet . Fabrics were colorful florals , ombre stripes , solid-colored textures , lively plaid and prints , and a new look in a definite houndstooth weave . Whether you are a young-in-years homemaker or a youngin-heart homemaker , do n't live in a museum ? a little mix-up of periods makes a stimulating room ! " Gingham " a brand new dictionary ( which should know better ) says " is a yarn-dyed cotton cloth , usually woven in stripes , checks , or plaids . It is used for aprons , house dresses , etc . " Fie upon the lexicographer or whatever they  | call a person who writes a dictionary ! House dresses and aprons indeed ! It is one of the biggest decorating assets we could have ? but like the dictionary definitioner , so many people never think of it that way . One wall of black and white gingham can make over a room quicker than an architect can say " new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or lemon-yellow chairs and your room is made . A gingham valance or gingham cafes or a gingham window shade can put a stamp of creative individuality to a kitchen , children 's bedroom , or family room . A child 's bedroom , as a matter of fact , could stand the whole gingham treatment . With snow-white walls , red and white checked gingham curtains and bedspread and a fire-engine red rug , what would make a happier room ( or a happier child ) ? Navy-blue and white gingham used on a sofa with two navy-blue chairs can be most effective used in a pine-paneled family room , study , den , or whatever you call your own particular relaxing spot . With bright green pillows tossed on the sofa and a bright green rug , you have a different-looking room and yet a restfully cheerful one . Pillow , tablecloths , picture mats , and shower curtains ( used with a plastic liner ) are gingham-minded subjects . So to be different ? this year go gingham ! People ( who are lucky ) have all kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stress today is a talent for good living . The ability to make your home a cheerful , colorful haven is a wonderful talent to possess . And anybody can develop this talent by simply having the desire and putting it into action . Where do you start ? How about doing away with that gray paint or that dingy " apartment beige " ? A warm , sunny  | beige is one thing , but that do-nothing off-white , slightly tan wall has little to do with " the talent for good living " ? it 's anemic ! So why not try a daffodil yellow , delphinium blue , Empire green , or a dove white ? Be definite about it , no wishy-washy in-between shade . And , of course , to have a talent for good living you have to have comfort . A chair may have a most interesting shape , but just sit on it for a few minutes and you feel as if your bones were all in the wrong places . Always try out sofas , chairs , and love seats before buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cushiony chair may prove more uncomfortable than a more prim one . That old saying " you ca n't tell a book by its cover " applies to furniture too . So no matter how impatient the salesman may become , " set a spell " and try out your furniture before you sign the check . Develop your own talent for good living in your house and watch what a difference it will make in your life ! Whether you go for canaries or parakeets , this is the season for yellow , either in small doses or in all-over sunshiny mood . The fashion world has gone all out for all shades of yellow , from the soft saffron to the pungent lemon yellow . And as the dress world of fashion goes , so seemingly goes the home fashion world ! Two yellow tweed chairs can charm a dull living room into looking alive and freshly au courant . A fringed area rug in shades of yellow with a dash of orange can wake up a bedroom quicker than an alarm clock , while a yellow and white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been invented . With leaf-green walls , crisp yellow cafe curtains create a daffodil mood that makes working in a kitchen a joy . And when yellow canisters , yellow-handled broom , dust pan ,  | and yellow ash trays have been added you have instant made-to-order sunbeams even on a dull day . Bathrooms react to yellow too in a happy way . Shower curtains , towels , mats , rugs , walls can transform a small insignificant bathroom into a golden bower of charm . Green plants and green or black or snow-white accessories give the yellow theme an added oomph ! The next time you need a color change ? yell for yellow ! There are always people who like something a little different from somebody else . For those individualists we have stalked the stores , peered over drafting boards , gone to furniture shows and here are a few suggestions we have turned up : 1 . An hour-glass occasional table , made of interesting curved slats on a walnut base-circular glass top . 2 . For the moderns who like the shape of early American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shiny brass , and a harvest table on modern lines with a table top in a planked cherry pattern with a finish that is heat , alcohol , and stain resistant . 3 . An electric grandfather clock designed in the contemporary manner with two or three shelves to hold knickknacks. 4 . For a summertime terrace or for year-round indoor living , a luxurious rattan sofa , two rattan lounge chairs , two end tables , and a cocktail table ? the tables with protective plastic tops . Fine for a couple who want something different and yet inexpensive . 5 . Tablecloth , napkins , place mats , and tea towels in a daring new print in mosaic design in gold , avocado green , or pink .  | Try something new and see what it will do for your house and you ! In the game world , there is always a " time out " period ? a time for considering what the next move should be or , in some cases , just a rest period to sort of get your breath . Every once in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period in your decorating routine . Some of us are apt to keep adding this or that , buying material without too much thought , or seeing a real bargain ? and then trying to find a place for it . If this is true of you every now and then , it would be a good thing to take " time out " and review your decorating problems with the eye of a stranger , and do n't buy a thing until you know what you want and what you need . Some houses are overdecorated ? just because the Lady in Charge does n't know when to stop buying . Have n't you been in houses where you mentally subtracted about four chairs from the room , and cleared off a mantel of all but about four good-looking objects ? I have ! It is n't because the lady does n't have good taste , necessarily , it 's just that she has n't taken " time out " to study her room . This is the season for that " time out " period . Before you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer take some time to clear your mind of all the confusing thoughts you have had about what to buy . Take time out to think before you shop , and you 'll make fewer mistakes and have a happier-looking house ! Whenever I listen to the June strains of " Here Comes the Bride , " I am apt to hope that she was a sensible brideto-be and made out a list of what she wanted for wedding presents . There 's nothing worse than ending up with five pickle forks , three candelabra , or a dozen silver pitchers.  | Just in case our brides need a little help , here is a list that might be useful ! One of the new area rugs in harem stripes or squares to go with your dreamed-of color scheme . . . . A wonderful willow trunk from Spain for any room to store anything or use as a barbecue equipment for the patio . . . . A whole covy of new light bulbs in new decorator shapes in candle-pink . ... The new add-a-table card tables that link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . A pair of classic Italian cigarette tables with marble tops bordered by a brass gallery for in front of the sofa or anywhere . . . . A new contemporary chaise longue with soft pillow headrest for the living room . . . . Eagle-backed Hitchcock side and arm chairs . ... A Japanese tea pot and handleless cups for your first tea party .... Personalized door knockers and trivets . . . . Colorful canisters decorated with gay apples . . . . Ice cream table and two ice cream parlor chairs for a him and her breakfast tete a tete . . . . A pair of hurricane lamps ... . Even if you are n't going to be a bride this June , there 's always a birthday or an anniversary coming up ? so get out your list ! Perhaps some of you many think I put too much emphasis on color . But just listen to this : According to a Mr. Howard Ketcham , who is a color consultant to one of the largest chemical companies , " The drab color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning . " He claims that student behavior and achievement improve markedly when pleasing colors are used on school interiors . And a group of educators and psychologists really tested this theory . They left one school unpainted . Painted another in traditional colors ? light buff and white ceiling . The third school was treated to cheerful yellow corridor walls , bright  | shades for dark rooms , etc . After two years the students in the " painted " school showed the most improvement in general class performance . Those in the unpainted school showed the least . Now if the " right " colors in schools can promote enthusiasm , lessen fatigue , raise over-all efficiency , you can see how important it is to have the " right " color around you in your own home . And that is what we have known all along , and why I stress so often that you live with happy bright colors , colors that make you feel good . A sunshiny yellow kitchen , for instance , with gay apricot curtains could do wonders for a small dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lots of snow white with touches of sky blue , brilliant green , and smart dabs of ripe cherry red are better than vitamins for a tired spirit . Try the color treatment today ! " If you 're not you , you 're nobody ! " These provocative words headed an ad for an individually blended make-up cream . But , as you know by now , I am a regular thief when it comes to headlines that may be applied to our decorating problems , so I plucked this one for today 's little talk , because it reiterates what I have tried to tell you ? if you do n't put the you in your decorating you 'll never be happy ! You may have a friend with the best taste in the world , but that is her taste . And when she urges you to put ruffles at your window when you feel better with a nice simple tailored curtain , you or nobody else is going to relish the result . I know someone who loves violets and she longed for a bedroom papered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with purple-violet dust ruffle , and leaf-green rug . But her sister ran across a lovely carnation  | sprigged paper and induced the poor woman to change her theme to a carnation pink one . She hated the room from the first , and proved once and for all that " one man 's meat may be another 's poison . " ( P.S. She finally got her violet room and was as happy as a humming bird with his first flower sip of the season . ) " If you 're not you , you 're nobody " ? if you want to be " Somebody , " be yourself and have what you like in your own home ! It 's so easy when you ca n't find just the fabric you want , to take the nearest thing to it . Or when you need a certain size vase for that one spot on the end table , you think , " Oh this one is good enough ! " And first thing you know , you 've got into the habit of accepting " second best " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to earn the name of a Crabby Perfectionist than it is to settle for second best . You 're never quite satisfied with the effect and have an uneasy guilty feeling every time you look at your purchase . Oftentimes when I was on a decorating assignment I 'm sure my assistants were ready to tear their hair because I would never settle for the second-best theme . If the room called for a circular valance , say , and they reported there was none made large enough ? my answer was , " Find one ! Have one made ! Concoct one , but get it ! " This took some doing at times , but the end result always paid off . And still does ! No matter how tired you get looking , do n't give up when you know your idea is the right one . You 'll find what you want eventually , and you 'll be happy if you do n't settle for second best !  | It 's the season of the wanderlust , and everybody wants to get out and go somewhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by for a night or two . No doubt your guest room will be their destination ! Is it ready ? Let 's start with the walls . If you have n't time or money to paint or paper them with a new fresh look , why not give the woodwork a bright lick of paint ? The side draperies and ruffle look fine across that double window , but your shades make the whole window wear a shabby look . Why not freshen up with some of the new decorative window shades in candy stripes or plain ones with a gay border or fringe ? How about the light bulbs ? Will your guest be able to read comfortably in bed or are they of mere candlepower dimness ? Any good reading material on the bedside table ? And is there a comfortable chair to relax in when a guest wants a few minutes alone in her room ? A box of facial tissue , a glass , and a small tray to hold toothbrushes , a razor , etc. , should be visible on one of the chests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or tiny trunk-box or something unusual to take it out of its mundane housing . Inexpensive throw rugs in exciting new colors are appearing in all of the shops and these could do a very special tonic job for that bare floor . Check your guest room ! Company 's comin ' . Are you ready ? Now I have heard everything ! Did you know there 's a new outdoor carpet on the market ? It is guaranteed not to fade , mildew , shrink , stretch , or rot . Rain and snow ca n't hurt it , and it never needs mowing ! Sounds like a magic formula for those places where grass wo n't grow ( city backyards ) or for an outdoor terrace . This amazing carpet is made of a nonabsorbent ( let me see  | if I can spell it ) polypropylene fiber . You can buy it in 3- , 6- , and 9-foot widths and it comes in red and bronze shades as well as terrace green . Available at many department and carpet stores this may prove a boon to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blew into their terrace . And speaking of rugs , never has there been such a variety to choose from . I 'm talking now of indoor rugs , of course . Navajo rugs are back in style and their clean-cut designs look almost modern ? and the colors are perfect for today 's living ! From Ireland we have hand-woven wool tweed rugs in seven glorious colors . From Australia , luxuriously thick rugs made of kangaroo skins ( these are expensive but if you want to walk on a kangaroo you must expect to pay for it ) . From Hong Kong a wool rug with an abstract design in startling red , orange , and blue . A rug from Tunisia is of natural straw with a bold black design . West Germany contributed a black and white cotton rug with a white fringe . There are paisley rugs , floral rugs , and rugs with wild borders . If you ca n't be " as snug as a bug in a rug " today , it 's your own fault ! There always has been a pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It used to be that sails were made of canvas and we would dream of a boat skimming along with the water lap-lapping against the sides and the spanking white sails billowing out in the wind . Today canvas in all its dazzling bird of paradise colors can bring a new life to your outdoor living this summer . You can transform old captain 's chairs , cover a faded chaise , or use it in gay free panels tacked on frames to keep your neighbors from peeking at your sizzling shishkabob . Fashion your own awnings over your terrace in one of the new turquoise or orange colors and add new color spice to  | your whole landscape . You can lace panels together to metal tubes for a windbreak when the wind blows to keep the paper napkins from blowing into the fried chicken , if you set up your picnic table under the trees in your backyard . Picnic tables become even more inviting with a wide striped canvas tablecloth , finished off with a wide sway-inthe-breeze fringe . ( They even have bench covers to match . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color to a boat , terrace , breezeway , or basement play room . With the fabulous new colors put your mind to using a pungent lemon yellow , a florescent orange , a cardinal red , a cornflower blue spot of canvas somewhere this summer . It will work magic for you ! There seems to be a sudden burst of " mantel-mania " across the country . " Other than the conventional candles and a clock , what can one use ? " Perhaps it is because we have stopped watching the burning logs and the flames leaping up the chimney which is a wintertime pleasure , and are concentrating more on bringing a fresh new look to the fireplace area . You do n't always have to have things on the mantel . You can arrange a cluster of pictures very low over the mantel or put up a series of decorative shelves , attractively spaced and show off interesting Staffordshire plates , bowls , vases , or a collection of wooden statuary in various sizes . Now for the mantel ? there are interesting half-ship models on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two goodsized pots of ivy or philodendron for one idea . The ship models I am speaking of are the reproductions of wooden hulls of famous ships and are sleek enough in design to go with either modern or traditional decor .  | Two wall sconces used very low on one end and a row of five or six red , pink , or white geraniums balancing the other end would make any mantel proud . A large painting , hung low , with two tall decorative vases on one side and two ornamental birds ( ceramic , glass , or whatever ) with long tails would give any mantel a distinctive appearance . You 're right in wanting to try something different ? and may all your mantels be magnificently individual ! Are you stingy in your arranging ? Are you a grouper or a loner when it comes to objects that will help you decorate ? It 's amazing what a little coupling or tripling up can do to the most ordinary articles . March a single file of small objects across a mantel and it does nothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A cluster of brass candlesticks , filled with various-sized candles makes a good " group . " They take on an attractive shape en masse and when lit , offer a soft concentrated glow that is most pleasant to behold . If you set something to hold cigarettes ( perhaps a goodlooking old snow-white ironstone cocoa cup ) a white ashtray and a box of large matches in a decorative flat box , grouped together on a cocktail table , they looked coordinated and " right . " But spread them out to stand in single file by themselves and they take on a lonely unwanted look . You can rid yourself of much of the clutter if you learn to group things , and somehow the effect is always for the better . If you have a bouquet on one end of a long table , grace it with a couple of small decorative objects to keep it company ? a nice ash tray , an interesting box . Think about your furniture grouping too . In other words , if you want a happier home , " join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To cool off our windows , why not take down the heavy draperies and try the very newest in window shades ? The new shade is called " Calcutta " and has all the spice and excitement that the name implies . It has a rich handloomed , textured look and made of jute yarn ( that has a fascinating sound right there ) it is as practical to keep clean as a window pane . And the colors ! Bombay orange , Punjab red , temple gold , Benares blue , Madras olive , Taj Mahal white , Ganges beige , and Ceylon brown . Think what these adventurous colors could do to a series of windows ! You could mix them , match them , have a striped effect across a group of windows ? the possibilities are limitless . Another cool idea is the matchstick bamboo roll-up blinds or cafe curtains either in natural or white . And now you can even get draperies in these ready-to-hang marvels . These bring an airy informal look to any window and are a pleasant change from your window dressings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat a room to summer freshness . Every summer you promise yourself that you will try something different at your windows ? and never get around to it . This summer ? do it !
