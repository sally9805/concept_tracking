The whole country seemed to breathe a sigh of relief . In three jammed galleries of Buenos Aires ' red-and-gold Chamber of Deputies , spectators embraced , cheered , waved handkerchiefs , then spontaneously broke into Argentina 's national anthem .

Soon after , the government arranged to release 350 political and labor union prisoners , and even freed deposed President Frondizi from house arrest . <P> When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Argentina-first policy , renegotiating the contro versial foreign oil contracts made by Frondizi ( see WORLD BUSINESS ) and re-examining Argentina 's monetary poli cies , now closely hewing to the austere line of the International Monetary Fund .
