Many an American male occasionally inspects his complacent life and for a minute imagines himself given over to singleminded , selfless service among the sick and poor of the world . Young Tom Dooley did not seem to be that type . Son of a comfortably well-to-do St. Louis ( steel fabricating ) family , he graduated with a middling record from Notre Dame and St. Louis University 's medical school , and his professors thought him destined to be a society doctor . Instead , Dooley volunteered for duty as a U.S. Navy doctor , was sent to war-torn Indo-China where he took part in the 1954 evacuation of 610,000 anti-Communist refugees from North Viet Nam . <P> In the nearly seven years that followed , until he died of cancer in Manhattan 's Memorial Hospital last week at 34 , Dr. Thomas Anthony Dooley III traveled 400,000 miles , raised $1,750,000 , established seven hospitals in four nations , and brought a measure of modern medical care to half a million underdoctored people . <P> Viet Nam 's misery in 1954 struck the young socialite with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deliver Us From Evil . " I must remember the things I have seen , " wrote Dooley . " I must keep them fresh in memory , see them again in my mind 's eye , live through them again and again in my thoughts . And most of all , I must make good use of them in tomorrow 's life . " Leaving the Navy , Dr. Dooley talked the International Rescue Committee into establishing MEDICO ( Medical International Cooperation ) , to build hospitals in remote areas . He underwrote MEDICO 's administrative costs himself with royalties from his book , set out on a nationwide lecture tour to raise additional funds ( individual donations ran as high as $100,000 ) , and persuaded U.S. drug and surgical-equipment companies to donate $1,000,000 worth of hard-to-get medical supplies . <P> Dr. Dooley built his first hospital at Nam Tha , a tiny Laotian village just five miles south of the Red China border , and his second at Muong Sing , 20 mi. to the northwest . He handled as many as 100 outpatients a day , wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Night They Burned the Mountain ) , and recklessly shrugged off the possibility of ambush as he pushed his Jeep through guerilla-infested jungle on daily house calls . A grateful Laotian government awarded Dooley its highest decoration : the Order of a Million Elephants . When critics argued Dooley was a " hit-and-run " doctor , he obligingly admitted to the charge . When they complained about his arrogance , Irish Catholic Dooley replied : " I know of but one meek , humble man who accomplished anything . That was more than 1,900 years ago-and I 'm not so sure he was meek and humble . " Then , in August , 1959 , Dooley underwent chest surgery at New York 's Memorial Hospital for melanoma-a rapidly diffusing form of cancer that is almost always quickly fatal . <P> Doctors were optimistic at first , but the melanoma spread to his back . Thin , exhausted and in pain , Dooley checked into a Hong Kong hospital last November , was fitted with a brace ( " my Iron Maiden " ) that extended from his shoulders to his hips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dooley insisted , with a typical touch of melodrama . " I will continue to guide and lead my hospitals until my back , my brain , my blood and my bones collapse . "
