txt Discount those rumors that Singapore 's Prime Minister , Lee Kuan Yew , is quietly campaigning for the post of UN secretary-general when U Thant steps down . The rumor was first mooted as a diary item in a London newspaper . Mr. Lee 's international travels may have given it some credence . But he himself , both privately and publicly , is adamant that he is not in the running . Singapore , with its population of 2 million , may be small . But Mr. Lee is known to want to devote all his energy to running it for the foreseeable future . With the British withdrawing from their huge military bases on Singapore by 1971 , Prime Minister Lee is masterminding a worldwide campaign to attract investors who will bring in new industries and boost the island 's economy . It looks as if it will be either the 9th or 25th Infantry Division that will be the first withdrawn by the United States from Vietnam . That 's the word reaching Saigon from the theater command in Hawaii . One of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add up to the 50,000 troops being bruited for withdrawal . If the 25th goes , other American units would have to replace it at its base in the Hau Nghia border province . A replacement division might be pulled together by taking two battalions of the 101st , which now has three brigades in central Vietnam , and adding the 82nd Airborne , already in III Corps . The 9th Division , the only sizable American unit operating in the populous delta south of Saigon , could conceivably be replaced by Vietnamese troops . When Anthony Grey is released , his first glimpse of the free world probably will be Hong Kong . He 's the British correspondent who has been imprisoned by the Chinese Communists in Peking for nearly two years . They are unlikely to send him back to Britain via Soviet territory . There is an air route from China to Pakistan . But the likeliest possibility is that Mr. Grey would be flown from Peking to Canton , and then put on a train for the short ride to the British colony of Hong Kong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor of Hong Kong , Sir David Trench , reviewed and reduced recently prison sentences on a number of Communists who have been in a Hong Kong jail since Communist-fomented riots in 1967 . Trends .. . President Nixon may wrestle with inflation . Western Europe may worry about the franc , the pound , and the mark . But the yen keeps on flexing its muscles . Without fanfare , Japan 's economy has just entered the 43rd straight month of its current boom  --  making this upswing the longest , biggest , brightest , and best in the nation 's postwar history , The Japanese have even dubbed the growth period the " Izanagi boom , " after the god in Japan 's mythology whose wife gave birth to eight large islands which became Japan . Despite rising interest rates and monetary weaknesses abroad , " Izanagi " shows every sign of continuing . It is backed by a balance-of-payments surplus , still-rising exports ( though at a slower rate than last year 's headlong rush ) , and large foreign-exchange reserves . How and why . . Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having some uncomfortable moments as it confronts requests from the United States , biggest of them all . Commerce Secretary Maurice H. Stans has just been in Tokyo asking Japan for two main concessions : To ease restrictions which keep out American automobiles , and to voluntarily hold down Japanese exports of woolen and synthetic textiles to the U.S. The government in Tokyo has already Promised to relax curbs on American cars by fiscal 1971 and now seems prepared to move a little faster . But its textile ialustry is flatly ( ) Nosed to limiting its exports to America which last year reached $500 million . Japanese executives contend that the American textile industry , largely located in the South , is still prospering and is urging President Nixon to protect it in repayment for Southern votes in last year 's presidential election . Yet Japanese leaders know this is a poor moment to be seen publicly haggling over trade with Washington . This is the year Tokyo will ask Washington to return control of Okinawa to Japan .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
