txt Sen. William Proxmire ( D ) of Wisconsin sees several signs that civilian arms of the federal government are exercising long-dormant muscles to control the military . In an interview he cites the following : ? The decision by Robert P. Mayo , director of the Bureau of the Budget , to put more men on the task of analyzing the budget of the Department of Defense . The Budget Bureau is one of the executive branch 's principal watchdogs on department spending . ? The action Sen. John Stennis ( D ) of Mississippi took last year ? breaking ? his Senate Armed Services Committee into . several subcommittees . This permits closer scrutiny of individual military projects than was possible by a full committee which had no subcommittees . ? A " much more favorable attitude in military spending . " ? An increasing disposition by the American public to look critically at military requests , rather than taking them on faith on the theory that the military knows best . Military mistakes aired Senator Proxmire has been in the vanguard in recent months of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiraling costs of some military products . The Wisconsin Democrat himself has been criticizing the Department of Defense , and the Air Force , for letting the costs of the C-5A rise without telling Congress about it . These planes , being bought by the Air Force , are to be the world 's largest cargo planes . Their cost , say critics of the Air Force , has risen from $3.4 billion to $5.3 billion . Senator Proxmire also has sharply criticized the Pentagon for muzzling critical employees whom Congress has asked to testify before it . ( They subsequently testified , with apparent freedonk . ) Senator Proxmire 's stand is part of the growing congressional sentiment to look critically at the military appropriations requests . In the past these generally sailed , almost without question , through an obliging Congress . Heretofore , the Senator says , " the Congress , and the public , and the President have all had an uncritical acceptance of what the military " asks ? on the grounds that military matters in the electronic age are so complex only military men could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think this acceptance is changing because the military people have made so many mistakes . " He ticks off the recent congressional disclosure of rising costs of several military items : Minuteman II missiles ( from $3 billion to $7 billion ) ; C-5A cargo plane ; deep-diving rescue submarine ( from $3 million to $80 million apiece ) . " That kind of disclosure has persuaded a lot of people that Congress has to make these decisions . " In the past congressional committees supposed to oversee the military have been largely composed of friends of the military . Instead of being critical they too often have been unquestioning advocates for the military . To some extent this is unavoidable , Senator Proxmire says , because " people tend to go on these committees who have an interest and enthusiasm " about military affairs . Doves , he says pointedly , generally do n't want to be dealing with the military day in and day out . But lie " sees evidence already that the Senate Armed Services Committee , for one , is taking a harder look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken up for the first time into subcommittees . Then , too , other congressional subcommittees  --  such as the Joint Economic Committee 's subcommittee on economy in government , which he chairs  --  also have gotten into // *Congress boosts efforts to grasp military . reins // the issue . And this committee is n't controlled by staunch military supporters . Likewise , individual congressmen have been speaking out . He says there 's " some evidence " following these disclosures that the Pentagon has begun to examine more closely its own budget and procurement policies . He says that for Congress to ' do its job at critically ' examining defense requests it must rely on accurate information from the pentagon . Recent hearings serve the purpose , , among others , of putting pressure on the Department of Defense to provide complete and : accurate figures to Congress . Congress also must get complete and accurate information from the 2,000 auditors in the General Accounting Office on costs of weapon systems . Within the executive branch , Senator Proxmire says , the Bureau of the Budget must question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also the need . ' He indicates this last question has n't been asked often enough . One point the Senator wishes to make plain ' is that he believes the military can be just as strong if the military budget is lower , as it is now . " You can make the assumption that we need as strong an ' armed ' force as we have now in terms of fireprower ... and yet consistent with that , argue that we can and should cut down on military spending because so much of it is wasteful and unnecessary . " He wryly says this position , hopefully , By a staff artist ? ? Under close scrutiny Soaring military costs are being looked at critically by the American public , says Sen. William Proxmire . They are no longer taken for granted , he says . can get the support of " doves and also the cheap hawks -- and there are a lot of cheap hawks ! "
