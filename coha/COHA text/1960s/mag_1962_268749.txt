Moscow last week seemed strangely quiet , becalmed by a news and diplomatic lull unparalleled in recent years . Virtually all the top Kremlin leaders were away from the capital , most of them probably down on the Black Sea coast talking business at Nikita Khrushchev 's winter vacation spot . Hence the West 's surprise when Moscow abruptly decided to heat up the Berlin crisis again with an ominous threat to the Allies ' three air corridors that lead over Communist territory to the surrounded city . <P> It began with a bland request by the Soviet officer on duty at the four-power Berlin Air Safety Center : because Russian planes would need exclusive use of the entire Berlin-Frankfurt airlane below 7,500 ft. for 3 hours that day , would U.S. , British and French aircraft kindly stay completely out of this zone ? In all the years since World War II , no one has tried to reserve specific air space by " block booking . " So the Western allies promptly replied to the Russians with a unanimous no . Next day , the Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Berlin-Hamburg and Berlin-Hanover air corridors ; again the answer was no , and the West sent military patrol planes up and down the routes , and passed on to Soviet headquarters the warning that the Russians would be held responsible for their safety . <P> By way of reply , MIG jets soared up to play tag with the Western planes , just as they had done several times before in Berlin 's war of nerves . Most kept their distance , but not all . One U.S. Air Force Globemaster pilot reported that a " stranger " zoomed to within 20 ft. of his wingtip , and a plane carrying Sir Christopher Steel , the British ambassador in Bonn , was buzzed by high-diving Communist pilots . <P> Moscow was possibly building up a case against four-power control of the Berlin airlanes ; after a sufficient number of Western rejections of Moscow 's " reasonable " requests , the Russians might try to walk out of the Air Safety Center , and hand their role over to Communist satellite East Germany , which desperately wants to assert its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole air corridor flap seemed more a test of nerve than anything else . When the U.S. , Britain and France fired off blunt , angry notes warning Moscow that it was " running the gravest risk , " the Russian nuisance flights abruptly ended and a Soviet official in Berlin announced that all requests for exclusive air space in the Berlin corridors had been canceled.
