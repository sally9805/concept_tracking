txt A twin-engine Piedmont Airlines plane crashed today just short of a mile-long runway at Charleston 's mountaintop airport , killing 32 of the 37 persons aboard . Piedmont officials said the plane , a Fairchild turbo-prop FH-227 , was making an instru ment approach to the 982-foot-high airport when it crashed and burned . Hospital spokesmen said later that three of the five survivors were in critical condition . The United States Weather Bureau said that the airport visibility at the time of the crash , 8:56 A.M. , was reduced to one mile by fog and smoke . Crashes Below Crest If the airliner had made its approach 50 yards higher it would have cleared the 300-foot ravine before the runway on which it was attempting to land . As it was , the plane crashed below the crest of the ravine , skidded to the top and continued onward for 75 yards about 50 feet to the right of the 150-foot-wide concrete strip . The airport was built more than 20 years ago ' by scraping off the tops of three mountains to form a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steep dropoffs at the thresholds of both runways . Most pilots consider the field safe , providing care is taken in poor weather conditions . Federal Aviation Administration officials said today that a vital part of the airport 's instrument landing system was not working when the Piedmont plane crashed . The agency 's tower chief at Charleston , William Butler , said that the " glide slope " at the airport had been inoperative since June 16 . The glide slope radiates a narrow , fan-shaped radio signal that allows a pilot to mon , Centinu -1 on Page 74 , Column 5 // itor his altitude above the landing runway from the threshold to about five miles out . However , Mr. Butler said , it it " standard procedure " for commercial airliners to make an instrument approach without the glide slope in operation . The Piedmont pilots were apparently relying upon a sophisticated altimentry syhtem aboard the plane to gauge their altitude above the terrain during their final approach to the runway .

A Bad Dream ' Col. Ralph Cowgill of the West Virginia Air National Guard said the plane burned for " less than 15 minutes " after the crash . Two National Guard pump trucks stationed less than a half-mile away from the crash site quickly brought the fire under control . " There was n't any warning . .. nothing ... nobody sensed anything , " said 19-year-old Barbara Schiller , one of the survivors , from her hospital bed . Miss Schiller , a resident of Cincinnati , said she had been flying to Virginia Beach , Va. , for a holiday weekend with two friends . " I thought it was all a bad dream , just a bad dream , " she said . " I was n't even looking out the window when it happened . I blacked out and when I woke up they were throwing foam all over us . " Miss Schiller said she had not wanted to make the flight because her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . Ted Armbrecht , a Charleston department store official , said he was sitting in a private plane with its pilot , Ralph Stone , waiting for the Piedmont craft to land . " All of a sudden there was a whoomp , " Mr. Armbrecht said . The two men said they looked out of the window of their plane and saw wreckage hurtling through the air as flames spewed from the stricken airliner . " Three or four persons were stumbling around outside the wreckage and we helped them into ambulances , " Mr. Stone said . " We could n't do anything for the others . The fire was too bad . " The dead were placed in a , large National Guard hangar . Piedmont officials said the victims included the pilot , Gent Sugg , and the co-pilot , John Messick , both of Winston-Salem , N. C.
