In Suite 1625-1633 of Manhattan 's Hotel Roosevelt , Republican Governor Nelson Rockefeller put the matter squarely to Republican Senator Jacob K. javits : the G.O.P. stood its best chance since Fiorello La Guardia to capture New York City 's mayoralty-and Jack Javits , a remarkable vote getter , was the man to do the job . In urging Javits to run , Rockefeller was playing for high stakes : a Republican victory in New York City next November would help Rocky carry the state next year and greatly enhance his chances for the 1964 G.O.P. presidential nomination . <P> Jack Javits agonized over the decision . He had compelling personal reasons for returning to New York . His raven-haired wife Marion loathes Washington and refuses to live there ; Javits therefore commutes by plane between Washington and New York two or three times a week . But Javits likes the Senate , and can satisfy his deep interest in foreign policy there . Said a top Republican who was present at the Roosevelt Hotel meeting : " Jack really has visions of public service and thinks he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being the only Jew in the Senate means a great deal to him . " Last week , therefore , Jack Javits finally and firmly declined to run for mayor . <P> Home to Bed . That decision shook New York Republicans , particularly since recent private polls have shown that Javits could handily defeat Democratic Mayor Robert Wagner . At first glance , it would seem that even the Ritz Brothers could beat " Bumbling Bob " Wagner . His administration has been spattered by scandal . His lurching efforts to satisfy all of New York City 's warring Democratic factions have satisfied none . He recently underwent surgery to remove a tumor behind the ear , and his health remains dubious . Last week , pale and drawn as he attended a Democratic banquet honoring Bronx Boss Charles Buckley , Wagner ate nothing , stayed only 17 minutes , then announced that he had to go home to bed . <P> But if Bob Wagner has won no dedicated admirers , neither has he won many dedicated enemies . New York 's general feeling about Wagner is summed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't a bad man-just a little incompetent . " In heavily Democratic New York City , the absence of strong feelings against Wagner is a Republican handicap . The G.O.P. can not hope to beat nothing with nothing , and must therefore come up with a strong candidate . <P> In the G.O.P. search after Javits ' withdrawal , the name of Paul Fino , 47 , five-term Republican Congressman from the Democratic Bronx , was proposed . Sniffed one Republican : " Who the hell is Fino ? " Also mentioned were : New York Herald Tribune Publisher John Hay Whitney , 56 , who has never run for important elective office ; Representative John Lindsay , 39 , an attractive , consistent vote getter from Manhattan 's Silk Stocking District ; and Chase Manhattan Bank President David Rockefeller , 45 , youngest of Nelson Rockefeller 's four brothers . But Whitney , Lindsay and David Rockefeller were all reluctant to make the attempt .
