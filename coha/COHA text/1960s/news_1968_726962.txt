txt Lyndon Johnson now faces the most stubborn dilemma of his presidency . He is caught between the pincers of Vietnam , where his generals call for more troops , and the Kerner commission report which demands massive " high-impact " spending at home . He has managed both guns and butter heretofore , though with increasing strain . Now he suddenly is faced with large additional demands for money on both fronts . His critics , notably those who oppose the war in Vietnam , say he is trapped at last , that he can not provide both . The President 's supporters say he still has room for maneuver , though they admit the tightening strain . There is a middle group of American opinion that has tended to support the war but is worried about next summer in the cities . It has not yet had time to react to the sudden new demands from both sides . The President has not , at this writing , spoken out publicly on either question . The President 's position can be anticipated . He gives the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general terms on both of his latest weekend trips into the South . Other side of coin ? The big  --  city mayors who have spoken out on the Kerner report ( of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders , headed by Gov . Otto Kerner of Illinois ) , most of them Democrats , prefigured the Johnson position on the other side of the . coin . The United States is a rich country , they said with near unanimity in a cluster of weekend television shows ; it can afford what it needs to do . None would take a position against the war , though Mayor John V. Lindsay of New York went so far as to say that he personally gave the cities a higher priority . The President is generally expected to take the same line : that the country can afford more troops for Vietnam plus a much greater effort in the cities . The argument for this course includes these points , as it is shaping up here : ? The highest priority needs of the cities according to the Kerner report are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slighting of Negroes by white city governments , which cost the least . ? The President is not likely to opt for a huge number of additional troops for Vietnam , at present . He is likely to talk only of sending those who are available , deferring further steps and quotas until later . ? The President is likely to raise his de mand to Congress for higher taxes , on the ground of wartime necessity . There are some who suggest that the dilemma be resolved by postponing or calling off the space program , but they are still in a small minority . The President answered them in advance by flying to the Houston space center even as the argument was being formed in the mouths of his critics . He doubtless sensed that it was coming . He said flatly , as did President Kennedy before him , that the United States // *Two pronged dilemma for L.B.1 // would not let any other nation ( the Soviet Union ) conquer space first and alone . Report anticipated In an even more important sector , that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While the report was still in the drafting stage , he launched his new program last month for having private industry virtually adopt the 500,000 sd-called " hard-core unemployed . " It began to apply the Kerner recommendations in this respect even be-the ink was dry on the report , and more massively . The President significantly announced last week that Henry Ford and his associates in the new national alliance of businessmen would announce their crusading organization down to the state and city level within a fortnight . He was scooping the Kerner commission . It is taken for granted here that the President was well informed as to the split between conservatives and liberals in the commission . It is assumed that he knew the liberals had a voting majority , though a bare one , toward the end . This meant a report with huge , immediate demands for spending in the cities this spring , before the summer tensions and before the political conventions and the election campaign . In the political atmosphere of Washington this was bound to look like an embarrassment to a President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops to meet an emergency in Vietnam . Industry to help So the President jumped the gun with respect to hard-core unemployment . This will cost money , but not big money because private industry will bear much of the burden . The President sent a housing message to Congress likewise putting a burden on private enterprise , confining the government cost to a subsidy . He is maneuvering for the best racial-open-housing law he can get , despite the long filibuster in Congress . In other programs touching the cities , some already the subject of messages to Congress , he is pressing the legislators further than they are likely to go unless the Kerner report fires them up . Mr. Johnson also has some room to wiggle provided by the fact that many of the pressing needs of the cities , listed by the Kerner commission , call for changes in attitudes and practices more than for money . At the head of its list of ghetto grievances is " police practices , " which are an administrative matter though higher salaries are important in the longer run . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headed by Mr. Ford will help to keep the costs down . " Inadequate housing , " " inadequate education , " and " poor recreation facilities and programs " are next in line and are admittedly costly , but the outlay is reduced by handling it through subsidies . Nonmoney areas cited The next three re not a matter of money : " ineffectiveness of the local political structure and grievance mechanisms , " " disrespectful white attitudes , " and " discriminatory administration of justice . " There follow " inadequacy of federal programs , " of " municipal services , " of " welfare programs " which are costly , and " discriminatory consumer and credit practices " whose cure is not . Out of this list , a good proportion of grievances can be met , if men and political structures are willing , by means that cost relatively little . The commission put white racism at the head of the causes of violence in the cities , and this , it is pointed out here , is a problem that requires no money and that money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that the President can run with a good part of the Kerner program and go part way with the rest , without exceeding the resources of the United States  --  if Congress and the people are willing to tax themselves in a political year for the war and for a great domestic emergency . The White House was interpreted as showing its strain ; when it faced this situation , by not welcoming the Kerner report with the usual open presidential arms . The White House usually has an advance briefing for reporters , in the case of an important report like this , with high officials available for questioning . There was none . The National Crime Commission , for ex- ample , was received by the President at . the White House for the ceremony of presenting its report , and a presidential statement was given out , This was not done for the Kerner group , despite the importance of its work . The text of such a report is normally given out by the White House . This time it was handed out by the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House , said one observer , belied the heat of tension within .
