 | Dina Merrill is " the new Grace Kelly , " one of Hollywood 's brightest new stars . Yet success has n't been without problems for this beautiful , talented , and determined girl who has had to overcome the handicap of being just too rich and too blue-blooded to be true . One of the most talked-about women in Hollywood today is Dina Merrill . She is rich , she is beautiful , she is the wife of a successful young businessman who rates 21 lines in Who 's Who , and the mother of three children ranging from six to thirteen . Yet for her this has not been enough . Determined to become a successful actress , she has already appeared in 19 television shows and seven movies , and new offers are coming along in batches . It 's hard for women on both sides of the fence actresses as well as nonprofessionals ? to understand why a girl who is already infinitely rich should work so hard to make good . A director , for example , told me : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even stars who are billed above her are a little resentful , afraid she is going 62  | to throw her weight around because of her money or social position . " Said a married woman with a child , who works in a Fifth Avenue beauty shop because she has to : " What makes me mad is that she is taking money away from the actresses in Hollywood who need it . " The wife of a New York advertising man asked bitterly : " Tell me , how is her husband taking these long absences while she is off making pictures ? " And a three-times-married actress ? who came from a background of poverty and who admits she acts to escape from herself in the characters she plays ? challenged : " What does Dina need to escape from ? Why is she knocking herself out on this acting bit ? You ca n't tell me something deep inside is n't gnawing at her . " Outwardly , nothing seems to be gnawing at Dina . The facade she presents to the world is that of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her : " In the fourteen years we have been married , there never has been a word spoken in anger between us . She is so straightforward and uncomplicated that she does n't recognize temperament . She does n't give difficult people anything to fight against . " DINA Merrill is straightforward , but to me she does n't seem uncomplicated . She told me : " Brought up the way I was , strictly disciplined . I could n't show my feelings . I used to lock myself in the bathroom and have terrible temper tantrums . Then , when I came out , I would be icy calm . Today I still do that ? or the equivalent . " Daniel Mann , who directed her in Butterfield 8 , in which she plays the role of a wife who resists divorcing her philandering husband , says : " I think there 's a whole side to Dina Merrill that is nobody 's business . She is n't the kind who displays her feelings . Although I watched her closely , I did n't sense even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep feeling there , the result of pain and sadness incurred sometime in her life . " Dina Merrill 's very drive to become an actress ? and the best , not one of the also-rans ? is much more than the restlessness of a woman who is bored by a life of parties and beauty shops and society . On the contrary , in spite of having a career she continues both to attend parties and to go along with her husband on business junkets . Her evaluation of herself is so modest that she says . " Having a career has been a good thing for me . Before , I was leaning too much on Stanley . " Much of the answer to Dina Merrill must be in her background . which she wishes reporters would forget . She deliberately took a professional name , hoping ? rather naively , as it turned out ? that nobody would find out who she was . ( Dina comes from her real name , Nedinia ; Merrill was borrowed from a brother-in-law , the ex-husband of one of her two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatic television shows in What Makes Sammy Run , The Time of Your Life , and NBC 's " Matinee Theater. " she was noticed only for herself . Bert Granet , of Desilu , told me : " One night I turned on my TV set and was watching a pretty bad show . I was ready to shut it off when a perfectly wonderful face flashed on the screen . She was there only momentarily , but I watched the whole awful business until the finish to learn her name . I was determined to have that girl work for me . " Dina did , in the TV show Murder is a Private Affair . Jerry Lewis and Hal Wallis had a similar experience when they were looking for a girl to play opposite Jerry in Do n't Give up the Ship . They both . separately , discovered Dina without knowing anything about her except that she had a fresh , arresting quality . ( She has been called " a Grace Kelly with warmth . " ) You ca n't keep many secrets in Hollywood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dina was not only in the social register but that she was Barbara Hutton 's cousin and nearly as rich . Earl Wilson , a columnist . remembered an old remark of Cary Grant 's : " When I was married to Barbara Hutton. " he is supposed to have said , " I was making fifteen thousand dollars a week , but she was so rich l felt like a gigolo . " Another columnist quoted the head of a studio ? inaccurately , it turned out ? as saying to Dina : " If you want to be an actress , why do n't you buy MGM or Paramount ? " Soon Dina was begging reporters : " Ca n't you leave the dollar sign out of stories about me ? " The better known Dina Merrill becomes ? and her two best roles are in pictures not yet released at this writing : Butterfield 8 , The Sundowners , and A Matter of Conviction ? the more curious people are about what she 's really like . Actually , she 's a member of what passes in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who created Postum and the cereal empire . When he died . in 1914. he left a 200.000 acre ranch in Texas , a winter home in Santa Barbara . a permanent home in Washington , D.C. , what the newspapers at the time said was the largest collection of art in the U.S. , and a business estimated at 20 million dollars . His only child was the woman who is now known in Washington , D.C. circles as " the Duchess " ? four-times married Mrs. Marjorie Merriweather Post May . Mrs. May lives on , a 24-acre estate called Hillwood , in the heart of Washington . Her house , which is destined one day to be a museum . stands on a high knoll with a view that includes her own gardens , rolling woods of Rock Creek Park . and the Washington Monument . Dina 's father was Mrs. May 's second husband , Edward F. Hutton , whose investment house bears his name . Although he is now eighty-three , in ill health and 139  | virtually retired to his Palm Beach home , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? chairman of the Board of General Foods , Zonite Products , a director of Chrysler Corporation , etc. ? and a charmer to boot . A young woman who played golf with him just four years ago told me : " He had more sex appeal than any man I 've ever met . " EVEN the circumstances of Dina 's birth are dramatic . When Hutton and Dina 's mother met , he was a widower , she a widow . Dina 's mother , who was then running her father 's business after his death , was the mother of two teenage girls . Her father had an only child , a boy eighteen . While Dina 's father and mother were still only engaged , his son was killed in a riding accident . Dina 's mother swore she would give him another . Their first child , a boy , was stillborn . Their second , a girl , was named Nedinia , a feminized version of her father 's name . A beautiful child born to middle-aged parents , both of whom were independently wealthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guards and private detectives that she had to grow up in an adult world . Not until she went to college was she allowed to live a normal existence with other young people . Her life was further complicated by her parents ' divorce in 1935 , when Dina was a small girl . Dina seldom cries in public , even when facing such bitter disappointment as failing to get a role she has very much wanted . Yet her eyes filled with tears on a Hollywood sound stage when , some 24 years after her parents had been divorced , she told me : " One day I was summoned into the living room , where my mother and father were waiting . They told me about the divorce . It was a terrible shock , and it upset me for years . Even after they had both remarried , I used to dream that some day we would all be back together again . " It is hard to estimate the effect of divorce on a child . Dina 's extrovert husband , handsome Stanley Rumbough , Jr. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was a child has not bothered him at all . Perhaps as a girl Dina might have wanted to be an actress because of the glamour and excitement connected with the stage and because it was such a perfect background for her blonde beauty . Now , however , she is competing as a professional with other big-league professionals . This girl seems to have no need to hide behind the characters she plays or even to escape into the backstage Bohemian atmosphere of the theater , as much as she enjoys it . The compulsion she does feel is to do her best at whatever she has chosen . People in Hollywood have often said they thought Dina would have been a success at anything she tackled . ' This may go back , even at this late date , to that unloved feeling that some children of divorce suffer from , and a desire to accomplish big things to make herself better loved . Dina says only , " I was stubborn , even as a baby . I thought I had to give up my career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second chance , I do n't mean to miss it . " People in the acting profession have seldom seen anyone like Dina Merrill . Directors who have ulcers from dealing with the whims and vagaries of actors are overwhelmed by her courtesy , her cooperation , her lack of temperament . One veteran cameraman , who remembers the days when whole sets had to be rebuilt so that one particular star could enter with her best profile showing , told me : " I asked her if she wanted me to watch out for any special angles . She told me no , except maybe the smile wrinkles around her mouth . Before the picture was over , I came to admire and like her more and more . If anybody had ever told me I would want to know an actress socially , I 'd have told him he was crazy . But I 'd like to have Dina for a friend . " Daniel Mann , who directed Butterfield 8 , says wonderingly : " When I want actresses to turn up at four o'clock , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are there by four . If I tell Dina she is due at four , she is there five minutes before time . When we were working almost around the clock , before the actors ' strike , Dina 's big emotional scene came late at night , after a long day . Many actresses would have refused to do it then , or would have broken down . She had many pages of solid dialogue , and she was so tired she kept getting her lines wrong . Instead of indulging herself by apologizing , she went doggedly back , repeating the words until she got them right . Only a real professional has that kind of persistence . And Dina adds , " It was a scene in which I tell my mother why I am not going to divorce my husband . It 's an emotional struggle for me to talk about divorce , even now . In addition to everything else , that was a complication . " DINA is liked by women as well as by men . Frances ( Mrs. Edgar ) Bergen remembers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Dina in the south of France . All I could think of was how awful I looked , and there was that blonde goddess . Yet she was so considerate and nice and honest that I grew terribly fond of her in a short time . When we were passing through Paris on the way home . she invited us to a party a cousin of hers was giving . We said we were sorry , our time was too limited . We did n't find out until later that the person giving the party was Barbara Hutton . " Patti Lewis , Jerry Lewis ' wife and one of the most candid and perceptive women in Hollywood , told me : " Usually when Jerry plays opposite a beautiful woman , I am human enough to resent her . But the minute I met Dina , I was completely taken by her . She shook hands firmly , she was dressed simply , and she talked about her children as one mother to another . I could tell she was n't one of those actresses who plays with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I began to hear the stories about how rich and social she was . must admit that when I next saw her I kept looking for signs . I never found any . She 's as simple and direct as anybody I 've ever met . " Before the rest of the cast meets her on any set , there is that moment of tension and resentment . One actor told me : " It 's only human . We 're clawing for a living , and here comes a gal who could buy and sell the whole lot of us . But I must admit that after about twenty-four hours , we all were crazy about her . You get to know people very well on location . and Dina did n't have an enemy in the cast or the crew . " UNDOUBTEDLY , part of the charm of acting , for Dina , is being part of the group , a member of the gang . On the sound stages of Hollywood and out on location in far-off places , Dina is finding some of the childhood she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasional petty feuds . At Key West , where Operation Petticoat was filmed , Dina stayed at the motel with most of the cast and crew instead of at a more luxurious hotel further away , where Cary Grant ? an old family friend because of Barbara Hutton ? and the producer and director were living . Dina and the gang used to eat together after work , and sit around and sing . One day she and a young achy named Nicky Blair , who prided himself on his cooking ability , conceived the idea of having a do-it-yourself barbecue at the motel . Everyone who wanted to participate was asked to sign a list . Afterward , the cost of the evening was split up and a small amount was charged each person who attended . In the middle of the collection , a few people began to whisper that this was " pretty cheap of such a rich girl . " The collection stopped instantly and Dina herself quietly took care of expenses . The ironic part of this story is , according to an observer , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salaries who complained ; it was some fellow actors . The discipline and control she learned as part of her childhood training has helped Dina face situations such as this . No one guesses that she is hurt by such affronts . But Dina Merrill is not a thickskinned girl , literally or figuratively . Experiences like these , much as they contribute to her maturity and perspective , must be hard for her to take . But she goes on taking them . And she goes on fighting for her everincreasing price in movies along with the rest of the actors . Undoubtedly this is because salary is partly a yardstick of ability . Amateur acting never interested Dina as a young wife , although she was given opportunities . If she wins , she wants to be in the big arena with the professionals . Also , like many people from similar backgrounds , she respects the value of money . She is generous and considerate but by no means a reckless spender . She has . a sharp eye for household and business accounts . A member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her household business ' over the telephone , said , " She is the most  | organized star I 've ever met since Joan Crawford . " It is strange that a girl with such force and strength should so genuinely underrate herself . Of her tennis , for example , which is far better than that of most men , she says : " Stan taught me all I know about the game . " She did n't want her husband to buy a small plane , yet when he did , she decided quietly that she would have to take flying lessons in ease of an emergency when he and she were flying alone with the children . INA must be trying to prove herself to her beautiful and capable mother , to her fascinating and brilliant father , to her fabulous grandfather , even to her husband , who once , when she did n't get a role because she did n't look athletic enough , wired the producer offering to back Dina in a contest involving swimming , golf , tennis , and skiing against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Acting apparently gives Dina a feelof accomplishing something completely on her own . And in this desire to stake her own mark she is not unlike other members of our so-called aristocracy , who feel they owe their importance to the money somebody else made . C. W. Post , Dina 's maternal grandfather , made a fortune from a line of breakfast foods he originally developed to cure his own ill health . After he broke down from overwork at the age of thirty . he spent the next seven years studying medicine , hygiene , diet and psychology . Before he went into the cereal business . he established , in 1891 . La Vita Inn , an institution in Battle Creek , Michigan , for healing through mental suggestion . Dina remembers that when her mother leas a little girl , C. W. Post used to hypnotize her before she went to the dentist 's so she would not feel the pain . As colorful as C. W. Post was , Dina 's mother Marjorie has more than matched him . Still incredibly beautiful at seventythree , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she lives in a style we lavish than that of many members today 's royalty . A friend of Dina 's recalls that one day , passing through Washington , she called Mrs. May 's home , thinking that Dina might be in town . Dina was n't , but Mrs. May insisted that the friend come to the house and spend the day . Mrs. May had a dinner engagement and had to leave , but Dina 's friend was served sitting alone at a long table , with footmen hovering behind her . In 1935 Marjorie Post married Joseph R. Davies , and was with him in Russia during his term as United States Ambassador there . While in Russia , Marjorie had become a particular favorite of the Russian women : Davies wrote in his book . Mission to Moscow , that Madame Molotov was especially impressed by the fact that " a woman of Marjorie 's type should be so interested in serious business and herself be a working woman . " He also reported that at a dinner given by Foreign Minister Litvinov " Marjorie looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She felt it was in  | better taste to wear none . The foreign minister opened the party with her , so what with the ambassadors , ministers . and young secretaries , the old man hisself ' was sorely put to it to get a dance . But the dear girl , my Marjorie , bless her heart , saw to that . " When the Davieses were divorced in 1955 , Marjorie gave him their Washington home . While her mother was being the belle of the ball at parties abroad , Dina 's father was trying to bring her up as he would a boy , to interest her in hunting and fishing . Dina could never bring herself to shoot a gun , for all loud noises terrify her . ( She wo n't let her own boys have cap pistols and she is still very much afraid when she has to shoot a gun in a play . ) She was also reaching the age when boys interested her more than fish . One day her father told her : " No decent man will marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her nails . " At just that moment . Dina happened to be sitting by a swimming pool doing her nails , and she never forgot her father 's remark . When she had earned her first thousand dollars by her own efforts . she treasured the praise she received from him : " I guess you 're a chip off the old block , after all . " No one in the family had ever acted . which may be why Dina chose that career . Her father was of the older generation that classed actresses with loose women . Her mother . more realistic , suggested that Dina take a secretarial course so that " no matter what happens . you can always earn a living . " Dina says . " I took that course . hating every minute . Three weeks after I had finished . I tried to use my shorthand during a history lecture and discovered that I had completely forgotten everything about it . That was my stubborn  | will 's answer to doing something that I knew was wrong for me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York and supported herself modeling for Vogue while she studied at the Academy of Dramatic Arts . She wanted very much , even then , to become an actress . But when the man with whom she was in love ? Stanley Rumbough , Jr. ? came back from serving in the Marines as a fighter pilot , she gave up her career to marry him , in 1946 . STANLEY Rumbough was a silver-spoon baby too ? his mother was a Colgate ? but he has so much energy and so many irons in the fire that I could n't help having a sneaking feeling that a wife with less drive than Dina 's would have bored him . In addition to his flying , he has been a leading amateur tennis player , is a trustee of International House , chairman of the U.S. Committee for the United Nations , for two years was a special assistant in the White House in charge of Executive Branch Liaison . Now he is president of his own thriving management-consultant and business-development concern and vice president of the family 's business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tubes for tooth paste , shaving cream , and similar products . In addition , Rumbough is very active in the Young President 's Organization , a group whose entrance requirement is that the man or woman be under forty and president of a company doing an annual gross of a million dollars a year . Her husband has never objected to Dina 's career and ' has , in fact , encouraged it . Eight years ago , Dick Powell , whom Dina had met through mutual friends , asked Dina if she would come out of " retirement " and appear on the Kate Smith show with him . It was his debut on television , and Dina was enormously flattered , but she never expected her husband to consent . He stunned her by saying : " Why not , if you want to ? " Stanley Rumbough told me calmly : " Nobody should try to decide about another person 's life . After we 'd been mar- ried and had our children , I think Dina felt being married and a mother was no longer a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest . " Determined as she is to make good as an actress , Dina is equally determined not to allow her career to harm her marriage or shortchange her children . Coming from a much-married family , living in the social climate of divorce , her own scars are still raw enough so that she would be willing to sacrifice anything , including her career , to keep her marriage intact . She also is bringing up her children in a normal , if moneyed , way , striving to give them the kind of childhood she missed . Home in New York , she has breakfast every morning at 7:30 with her husband and children . Her day always includes one singing and one acting lesson . plus the management of the household , various chores she does for the children , shopping ? she was named one of the ten best-dressed women in America last year ? and charity work . At 4:30 she is always home , for this is her time with the children . If she and her husband have no dinner engagement , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My mother used to worry when I went out to California to do a show because it was such hard work with the long hours and early calls . Then she realized I always came home blooming with health . Having only one job to do at a time is like a rest cure . " Her father is still not quite reconciled about her choice of career . When he saw her on television with Jackie Gleason in Time of Your Life ? where the small part she had received considerable critical praise ? his only comment was : " I did n't like to see you sitting there on the screen drinking beer , Deenie . " Professional people , much as they like Dina personally , are not quite so unrestrained in discussing her potential . First , there are the six years she lost before she started to act again , and the two years tacked on to that when her husband was in Washington and she had to commute to New York for small jobs . Although no actor or actress can be expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider that Dina has been married fourteen years . has one son thirteen , and a husband who is frankly forty . He tells about her being a " little girl in boarding school " when he was at Yale . so the gossip puts Dina in her middle thirties . Many a top-flight star would love to be in her middle thirties again , but few of them ever attained stardom that late in life . Fred Zinnemann. who directed Dina in The Sundowners , has worked with nearly every star in the business . He told me : " If she had started earlier . there would have been no stopping her . She is enormously impressive on the screen . Real breeding and distinction are hard try come by . and the genuine quality makes audiences sit up and take notice . " Jerry Lewis told me : " She can work for me any time she wants . In a town filled with phonies she 's like a lump of sugar after a lot of sour lemonades . " Jerry sent her roses the day she appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent another bunch . " The first were n't good enough for you . he told her . Another actor said : " Dina 's fine to work with and a honey to know . Yet you ca n't be a great actress without a long background of experience in the only real training ground . there is ? the theater . Those eight years when Dina might have been getting it she was taking care of babies and going to parties . I 'm afraid she 's set her aim too high . " D INA Merrill is not given to self-deception or to overrating heiself . She knows all these facts better than anyone else , and she guesses what people must be saying about her . Her answer is , deliberately and stubbornly : " I 'm not a worrier . Chewing over what might have been is the most exhausting thing in the world . I 'm not a perfectionist , either . about anything except acting . Maybe I 'll never be a really big star . Maybe I will . But I want more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good actress . What I intend to be is the best gosh-darned actress in the world . "
