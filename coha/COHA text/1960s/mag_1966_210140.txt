Resource-rich , highly industrialized , welfare-loving Sweden has long enjoyed the highest living standard in Europe . Prices are stiff ( 76 for a pack of cigarettes , $9 for a fifth of Scotch , $1.50 per Ib. for hamburger ) , but after 32 years of unbroken and rising prosperity , Sweden 's workers have grown so affluent that about all the tiny , obstreperous Communist Party could find to demand in the last election was " two houses for every family . " Swedish families already own 375,000 vacation homes and 300,000 pleasure boats , as well as a car for every four persons . Domestic tranquility is rarely ruffled by labor trouble : the last strike of consequence took place in 1945 , when 130,000 metal workers walked out for five months , and there has been no general strike since 1909 . <P> Last week that enviable record was preserved-but just barely-as the Swedish Trade Union Confederation ratified a three-year contract with the Employers ' Confederation covering almost all of the country 's 3,050,000 workers . Before the agreement was signed , Sweden for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its economy . Labor demanded an inflationary 11 % - a- year pay increase , and management countered by setting a date to lock workers out of 90% of Sweden 's industries . Only the cozy personal relations between the chairmen of the opposing federations , who have been negotiating with each other for so long that sometimes they take their wives along and talk aboard a yacht , resolved the deadlock . The settlement may prove nearly as disastrous as a strike , by pricing Swedish goods out of world markets . Swedish labor-already the highest paid in Europe-won a package of shorter hours and higher pay that will boost employers ' wage costs by 30% over three years . Example : Stockholm construction workers will earn $3.20 an hour , work 42 hours a week . Said Prime Minister Tage Erlander : " We do see some inflationary dangers in it . " <P> Sweden is already troubled by inflation . Prices jumped 61% last year , partly because wages have been going up between 8% and 11% a year since 1955 and productivity has not kept pace . Predictably , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year , while exports gained a mere 3.3% ; last week the government announced that the trade deficit continued to rise sharply during January and February . To halt that ominous trend , Erlander expects to give his country an unpleasant antidote that the U.S. , confronted with almost the same problem , has so far spurned : a strongly deflationary budget , stiff tax boosts , sharp cuts in government spending .
