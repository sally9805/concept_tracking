Everybody is entitled to his opinion-but in the eyes of many editors , Columnist and Author ( The Day Christ Died ) Jim Bishop was voicing some very peculiar opinions last week . Bishop took a two-week vacation in sunny Haiti , where an especially brutal dictatorship dishes out voodoo , terror and death . In five columns distributed to 159 newspapers by Hearst 's King Features , Bishop wrote as if he were in a delightful if somewhat seedy country of racial harmony , fiscal integrity , health and peace . <P> To Bishop , Dictator Franois ( " Papa Doc " ) Duvalier was " honest " and " intelligent . " Commenting on last year 's carefully supervised election , in which Papa Doc stood alone on the ballot , Bishop wrote : " The Haitians liked him so well that they elected him President for life . This was not a spurious , rigged election . He could call one tomorrow and win easily . " Bishop was equally impressed by the dictator 's secret police , the tonton macoute : They " comprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquainted with the true temper of the people . " <P> This was a bit much for many newspapers . The Miami Herald dropped one column , in which the editors counted what they considered to be several errors of fact or judgment , and heavily edited two others . Other papers-the Milwaukee Sentinel , St. Louis Post-Dispatch , Cleveland Press and Philadelphia Bulletin-decided against running at least three of the columns .
