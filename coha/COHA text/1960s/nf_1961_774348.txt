txt  | age freight rates of 1.4 cents a ton-mile , while to the west the average for the Burlington , the Santa Fe , and the Union Pacific was 2.5 cents a ton-mile . In 1890 the traffic east of the Missouri had an advantage of 0.95 cents against 1.25 cents a ton-mile , and in 1900 the eastern area still retained this advantage by a margin of 0.83 cents to 1.03 cents a ton-mile . Railroad freight rates seemed high to the western farmer in the generation after the Civil War , but they were , in fact , dropping more rapidly than the price of farm products , as can be seen in the table below . Farm prices dropped only 37 per cent from 1870 to 1900 , but freight rates dropped nearly 70 per cent in the thirty-year period and 59 per cent west of the Missouri in the twenty years from 1880 to 1900 . Distance was as important a factor in the farmer 's transportation problem as high freight rates . The West was a big place ; its territories and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a long way to market . To get his produce to market the farmer in South Dakota or Kansas might have to send it several times the distance required by his competitor in Ohio or Indiana . The average length of all railroad freight movements in seven northwestern states ( Iowa , Minnesota , Nebraska , North and South Dakota , Wyoming , and Montana ) in 1890 was 201 miles , as contrasted to a national average of 113  | miles and a 69-mile average haul in the New England states . High basic freight rates plus distance resulted in transportation costs to the prairie farmer that placed him at a significant economic disadvantage . In spite of high freight rates , the long haul to market , and other transportation discriminations , farmers and settlers poured into the prairie states after the Civil War . Veterans headed for western homesteads via the new railroads of Iowa and Missouri . " Zulu " cars for immigrants and land-seekers were crowded in most of the prairie states in the seventies and eighties . The land agents of the Burlington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competed with each other and with the rival attractions of the steel mills and mines of Ohio and Pennsylvania as they met the immigrants and steerage passengers at eastern seaports . The extensive colonization literature of the Santa Fe paid off in 1874 when company agents convinced 1,900 Russian Mennonites , complete with $2,000,000 in gold drafts , that their future lay in fertile plains of Kansas . The Northern Pacific gained as settlers tried to emulate the reported success of Oliver Dalrymple 's bonanza wheat farm in the Red River Valley of the Dakota Territory . The Burlington promoted extensive programs in agricultural research and new dry-farming methods in western Nebraska and eastern Colorado , even though it had no land to sell in those areas . j Settlers came in increasing numbers . The annual average of perfected homestead entries rose to more than 2,500,000 acres in the eighties and to more than 3,000,000 acres in the next decade . The first tier of trans-Mississippi states ( Minnesota to Louisiana ) more than doubled in population , from 4,500,000 to nearly 10,000,000 , between 1870 and 1900 . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population and industrial development in the half-century after the Civil War . American railroads easily kept pace with this expansion . Not only the West but the entire country expanded in population and strength in the years between 1865 and the nation 's entrance into World War I. As America shifted from an agrarian people to an industrial nation , the population nearly tripled , rising from 35,700,000 in 1865 to 103,400,000 in 1917 . In the same half-century the rail network increased more than sevenfold , from 35,085 miles in 1865 to an all-time high of 254,037 in 1916 . By the second decade of the twentieth century the only significant portions of the United States more than twenty-five miles from rail service were in the relatively unpopulated plateau and mountain areas of the West . Almost the entire nation was literally within the sound of a  | locomotive whistle . In the five decades between the wars the volume of the railroads ' gross operating revenue increased at least twelvefold , from perhaps $300,000,000 in 1865 to over $4,000,000,000 in 1917 . The rail lines in the middle teens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial freight and passenger movement . The new transportation facilities offered by buses , trucks , private autos , pipelines , and airplanes were not yet serious competitive threats to the railroads . As America faced the problems of a world at war , her railroads were still living in a golden age . The half-century was in other ways a period of retrogression . Many , perhaps most , of the post-Civil War railroad lines suffered from the evils of inflated construction costs , fraudulent stock manipulations , and incompetent management . Such speculators as Jay Gould , Jim Fisk ( 1834 ? 72 ) , and Daniel Drew became expert jugglers of corporate property . And even more sober and respected members of the rail management group , such as James J. Hill of the Great Northern , or James C. Clarke ( 1824 ? 1902 ) of the Illinois Central , followed patterns of business ethics that would not be tolerated in the twentieth century . Concurrently , discrimination in freight rates between individuals , localities , and articles forced merchants , farmers , and communities to agitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a measure of rail service , they tended to grow hostile toward the railroads , especially if times were bad . James C. Clarke of the Illinois Central saw this public hostility as inherent when he wrote to Stuyvesant Fish ( 1851 ? 1923 ) in 1883 : " The people are in favor of building a new road and do what they can to promote it . After it is once built and fixed then the policy of the people is usually in opposition . " But a dominant theme in the last  | decades of the nineteenth century was that of corruption and rate discrimination , and the increasing governmental regulation which followed was a natural result . The years of monopoly , corruption , discrimination , and ever increasing regulation were also the years in which the prevailing fashion in American economic philosophy shifted from a pronounced laissez faire doctrine to one of increasing governmental restraint and control . The American rail network was completed in the very years when the Progressive Movement was reaching its climax . It is certainly unfair to judge the business ethics of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighties solely by a set of rules and values which became standard and were accepted only in a later generation . Actions of " smart " operators which were honored and emulated in the early years after the Civil War would have resulted in legal prosecution if pursued a generation later . Nor should it be forgotten that the very impatience of the public for an immediate and complete rail service in the years after the Civil ' War aggravated a situation in which rail management was hindered by a lack of adequate experience in both building and operating a facility of such size . There was corruption in railroad management throughout the nation in the years after the Civil War , but some of the earliest and some of the worst accompanied Reconstruction in the eleven Confederate states . Ruined as they were by the war , southern railroads put most of their energy into the restoration of old lines in the decade after 1865 . New construction in the southern states was extremely slow compared to that in the rest of the nation . In the first postwar decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southern mileage increased from 9,071 miles to 14,421 miles , a gain of  | only 59 per cent . Illinois alone laid as much new track in the decade as all of the Confederate states east of the Mississippi . Moreover , the late sixties and early seventies were years of intense and profitable railroad activity by carpetbaggers and their white and Negro resident collaborators . The visitors from the North built little new mileage , for they were more interested in raiding a state treasury or milking a railroad exchequer than they were in the hard work of actually building a railroad . Many southern states paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars for railroads that were never completed or even honestly started . Most of the carpetbag activity in the railroad industry was confined to the six coastal and eastern states running from Virginia to Alabama , but the experiences of North Carolina and Georgia are typical . In the years 1868 ? 69 the legislature of North Carolina authorized the issuance of $27,850,000 in state bonds to thirteen different railroads in the state . Of those authorized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroads , but only 93 miles of line were built in the years 1869 through 1871 . Instead , most of the proceeds from the sale of the bonds went into the pockets of a railroad ring , where it was spent for such things as gambling junkets in New York City and bribery in North Carolina . The suave and genial General Milton S. Littlefield ( 1830 ? 99 ) of Illinois and New York was the active leader of the ring . Control of the pliable legislature of the state was made easier by the governorship of W. W. Holden ( 1818 ? 92 ) , a personally honest man who was generally weak and incompetent . While General Littlefield dispensed free wine , liquor , cigars , and good fellowship from a bar set up in the west wing of the Statehouse , George Swepson ( 1819 ? 83 ) , paymaster of the ring , was paying  | out over $133,000 in more direct gratuities to a dozen or more legislators and officials . An acquaintance of one of the recipients found the aged Negro legislator happily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Negro said : " Well , boss , I 's been sold in my life ' leven times and ' fo ' de Lord , dis is de first time I eber got de money . " Naturally , Littlefield and Swepson did not receive all the state railroad aid , but they were issued $6,367,000 in crisp new state bonds for their chosen road , the Western North Carolina . The bonds were sold for about 53 cents on the dollar . Very little of the more than $3,000,000 was used to give western North Carolina more railroad . Things were no better in Georgia . The state did add substantial rail mileage during Reconstruction , but it was in spite of the carpetbagger rather than because of him . Prime mover in the corrupt railroad activities was Hannibal I. Kimball ( 1832-95 ) , one-time carriage-maker in Connecticut . After the war he shifted to selling railroad sleeping cars but sometimes sold the cars without bothering to complete delivery . In Georgia between 1868 and 1871 he received much state railroad aid without bothering to build the railroads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the Republican officeholders who could help him . Several times he made substantial cash deposits to a bank account opened freely to the governor of the state , the ample and amiable Rufus B. Bullock ( 1834-1907 ) , also a short-time resident of Georgia . Kimball 's persuasive extravagance was so great that fellow citizens claimed the only way to resist him was to refuse to see him , and Negro officeholders learned a song : " H. I. Kimball 's on de floor ; it ai n't gwine ter rain no more . " During the Bullock-Kimball regime potential state aid  | of nearly $40,000,000 was authorized for thirty-seven different companies , nearly all of which had little more than a paper existence . Corruption was just as rife on the state-owned Western and Atlantic Railroad as elsewhere . Mismanagement became colossal as old employees were dismissed to make way for political " patriots , " the well-paying ( by the sale of tickets en route for cash ) conductor jobs being reserved for the sons of legislators . The company auditor explained to a subsequent investigating committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of a $2,000 annual salary only by practicing the " most rigid economy . " Public clamor against the graft became so great that by late winter in 1870 the legislature was willing to lease the road if it could be granted to the " right people . " The successful syndicate included H. I. Kimball , plus the more respectable conservatives Joseph E. Brown ( 1821 ? 94 ) and John P. King of the Georgia Railroad . Clearly , the excesses of the carpetbag and radical regimes in the South helped set a new low for the business ethics of the entire nation in the postwar generation . In the northern and eastern states after the Civil War the corruption and chicanery found in much of the railroad management was almost beyond comparison . Where Kimball , Swepson , and Littlefield had stolen thousands of dollars or here and there a million from short railroads in single states , Vanderbilt , Drew , Gould , and others were making millions and tens of millions in manipulating rail systems extending for thousands of miles . Since the rail lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were big systems with a heavy and profitable traffic , it was natural that the corruption , when present , was also immense . Watered stock , stock- market rigging , corrupt and dishonest management , rate wars , rebating , and labor violence were all part of the railroad picture in the postwar generation . The oldest and perhaps the greatest of the northern railroad barons was Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt . At the ripe old age of sixty-eight , already possessing an $11,000,000 fortune gained from shipping and steamboats , the Commodore turned to railroads in 1862 . Conquering a long-time aversion to railroads , which might be traced back to a serious injury received in a wreck on the Camden and Amboy in 1833 , the old man secured control of the New York and Harlem for no more than $9.00 a share and the New York and Hudson for about $25.00 a share . The two lines provided service up the Hudson to Albany . Erastus Corning 's New York Central had a habit of transferring freight and passengers to Vanderbilt 's line at Albany only when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate . This the Commodore did not appreciate , and in midwinter ( January , 1867 ) he suddenly stopped service between his own lines and the New York Central at the Albany bridge . Missing the leadership of Corning , who had retired because of poor health in 1864 , and also that of his tough-minded successor , Dean Richmond ( 1804-66 ) , the leading stockholders of the New York Central requested Vanderbilt to vote their proxies along with his own recently acquired stock in the annual election of December , 1867 . As the new president , Vanderbilt , with the expending of some money on the legislature in Albany , obtained the right to consolidate his two major roads into the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad . The Commodore ran his line with verve . He banned the use of color and brass ornaments on his  | locomotives and voted himself a bonus of $6,000,000 in cash and $20,000,000 of new watered stock ( with perhaps $20,000 , - 000 more for the other shareholders ) . The old man proceeded to make the railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , annual dividends of from 6 to 8 per cent on the inflated capitalization . The Commodore was not alone in his stock-watering . In May , 1869 , the Commercial and Financial Chronicle reported that in less than two years twenty-eight railroads had increased their capital from $287 , - 000,000 to $400,000,000 . In his management of railroads the senior Vanderbilt was much aided by his eldest son , William H. Vanderbilt ( 1821-85 ) , who returned to the inner family circle from his Staten Island exile after he had so dramatically rehabilitated the Staten Island Railroad . William soon became vice-president of both his father 's first two railroads , and later , in the seventies it was at his insistence that the Commodore extended his lines to Chicago by buying the Lake Shore &; Michigan Southern and the Michigan Central . All the roads prospered under the Vanderbilt management , as is clearly shown by the growth of William 's inheritance of perhaps $90,000,000 in 1877 to a fortune of $200,000,000 at his own death in 1885 . Father and son were remembered by the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locomotives , which railroad men called " Black Crooks , " but also for their language . The old Commodore 's " Law ! What do I care about law ? Hai n't I got the power ? " was undoubtedly apocryphal , but son William probably did say , " The public be damned " in an interview with reporters in his private car near Chicago . William H. clearly thought the New York Central should be run for the benefit of the stockholders.  | The struggle for the control of the Erie Railroad in the decade after the Civil War was one of the most spectacular chapters of nineteenth-century American finance . Once in control of the New York Central , Vanderbilt naturally was interested in the future of the Erie , his major competitor in the state . But the man who controlled the Erie was that ancient rustic who looked like a country deacon , Daniel Drew . " Uncle Daniel , " former drover of cattle and " watered " stock and long-time rival of Vanderbilt in the steamboat business , invested heavily in Erie stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had prevented a rail disaster by flagging down an Erie train with a pair of her red woolen drawers . In 1867 , when the Commodore was buying Erie stock , Drew was aided in his management of Erie by a pair of rascals from Vermont and Connecticut . Jim Fisk , roly-poly son of a Vermont peddler and all brass , had served an apprenticeship to his later financial buccaneering as ticket-seller for Van Amberg 's circus . He had also been a tin-peddler and a buyer of Confederate cotton before becoming a stockbroker in Wall Street . Jay Gould , anything but an extrovert , was to prove a better manipulator of stocks than either Fisk or Drew . Gould and Fisk had already helped Drew unload on the Erie the small Buffalo , Bradford , and Pittsburgh Railroad . The purchase price of $2,000,000 in Erie convertible bonds was a sum eight times the true value of the acquired road . Finding the Commodore still eager to buy Erie stock , the trio unloaded 100,000 crisp new shares ( converted from Erie bonds ) on the old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1868 , obtained from his good friend Judge George G. Barnard ( 1829 ? 79 ) a warrant to arrest Gould , Fisk , and Drew . The trio ferried across the Hudson and found safety in  | Taylor 's Hotel in Jersey City , surrounded by $6,000,000 in cash , more unsold bonds , and a large body of guards commanded by Fisk . From the safety of " Fort Taylor " the breezy Fisk gave the following statement to the press : " The Commodore owns New York , the Stock Exchange , the streets , the railroads , and most of the steamships there belong to him . As ambitious young men , we saw there was no chance for us there to expand , and so we came over here to grow up with the country . " Gould hurried to Albany , where the expending of at least $500,000 on the legislature and assistance from Senator ( Boss ) William M. Tweed ( 1823 ? 78 ) legalized the whole affair . The old Commodore admitted defeat and retreated to his New York Central , muttering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it never pays to kick a skunk . " Drew , now replaced in top Erie leadership by Gould , turned to less successful exploits on Wall Street , where he was finally ruined in the Panic of 1873 , left with little more than his Bibles , hymnbooks , and sealskin coat . Fisk , the new vice-president , was known as " Prince of Erie " and had a marble and gilded office in Pike 's Opera House , which he and Gould rented to Erie at the not too modest rate of $75,000 a month . He went on to be " Admiral " of his own steamship line and Colonel of the 9th Regiment , New York National Guard . But his flamboyant career was ended early in 1872 , when he was shot by a rival for the affection of his favorite mistress , Josie Mansfield . The Erie Railroad lay in ruins , and Gould soon took his profits elsewhere . Karl Marx once described the experienced man of business as possessing fine hearing and a thick skin , a man capable of being venturesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He might well have been describing Jay Gould as that gentleman maneuvered the fortunes of the Union Pacific in the seventies . By 1874 , Gould controlled this Pacific road , having bought the shares , beset as they were by the Panic of 1873 and the memory of the Credit Mobilier , for as little as $14.00 a share . He then forced the Union Pacific to take at par the shares of both the Kansas Pacific and the Denver Pacific , roads he had purchased for a few dollars a share early in the depression . It had been looted long before , but Gould contrived to extract from the Union Pacific more than $10,000,000 before the management was taken over by Charles F. Adams , Jr. , in 1884 . As Drew had said of Gould , " his touch is death . " In the eighties , Gould , whose frail body was already worn thin by advanced tuberculosis , was just as ruthless in his control of the Wabash , the Missouri Pacific , and the Texas and Pacific . When he died in 1892 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time was being called a pirate and a scourge by the New York Times , left a fortune conservatively estimated at $77,000,000 . There were other railroad abuses in the postwar years besides the excessive watered-stock operations of Vanderbilt , the thimblerigging market operations of Drew , and the general chicanery of Gould . In the sixties , seventies , and eighties many railroads participated in rate wars , which resulted in a general disturbance of normal business . During such " wars " the complaint of shippers and merchants was not so much against the published rates as against the fluctuation and uncertain departure from established rates . Shippers in the New York Cityto ? Chicago area complained that the published rates often varied from forty to sixty times in a single year . Naturally , the bulk of the rate-cutting occurred in competi- tive regions where several lines served such routes as Chicago to New York City , Chicago to St. Louis , or coast to coast . When the Erie and New York Central were fighting , the Commodore finally slashed his livestock rates between Buffalo and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim Fisk retaliated by making heavy cattle purchases in Buffalo , after which he very profitably shipped his livestock to market over his rival 's road . Passenger fares were also cut . A ticket from New York to Chicago reached a low of $5.00 in 1881 , and at one time in 1884 the Chicago ? to ? St. Louis fare dropped to $1.00 . The transcontinental traffic had been so heavy in the spring of 1886 , when a New York ? to ? California ticket cost only $29.50 , that a western rail official claimed that they were now carrying " tramps . " Many of the rate wars were aggravated in total effect by the practice of bankrupt lines , or those in receivership , charging very low rates . Temporarily free of meeting their interest payments , such lines could afford to reduce their rates , hoping for preferred treatment when rate stabilization occurred or the next railroad pool was arranged . In 1882 , Vanderbilt bought up such a line competing with his Lake Shore road when he purchased control of the Nickel Plate ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a syndicate headed by George I. Seney ( 1826 ? 93 ) and Calvin S. Brice ( 1845 ? 98 ) . Seney and Brice , who were becoming known for their fast-and-loose management of southern railroad property , were indifferent about whether they sold their road to Gould or Vanderbilt . When Vanderbilt complained that the Nickel Plate was bankrupt , Brice clinched the deal by answering : " No one knows that better than I do , but do you want to compete with a receiver ? "  | An obvious answer to rate wars was the railroad pool . The public naturally objected to pooling because it tended to keep rates high , but the typical railroad executive favored the pool as the best solution to cutthroat competition . One of the earliest pools was established among three western lines , the Burlington , the North Western , and the Rock Island . Having approximately equal facilities for handling the through traffic between Chicago and Omaha , the three roads decided in 1870 that each should have a third of the business . This arrangement , known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it gave way to a larger organization , the Western Freight Association , in 1884 . In the southern states rate stabilization was achieved with the organization in 1875 of the Southern Railway and Steamship Association . Colonel Albert Fink ( 1827-97 ) , former general superintendent of the Louisville &; Nashville , was so successful as the first commissioner that twenty-seven railroads were members by 1877 . Colonel Fink soon moved on to administer a still larger pool covering the trunk lines between New York City and Chicago . But even Fink could not assure a permanent peace among the eastern lines . Some of the rate wars occurred as rival systems built , or threatened to build , " nuisance " or parallel lines in a competitor 's area . In the early eighties such a struggle developed between William H. Vanderbilt 's New York Central and the Pennsylvania Railroad . In 1881 the New York , West Shore , and Buffalo was chartered to build a line on the west side of the Hudson , paralleling Vanderbilt 's property all the way to Buffalo . The West Shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was partially financed by George M. Pullman , who was angry because Vanderbilt had used his  | own Wagner sleeping cars instead of Pullmans on several New York Central subsidiary lines . The Pennsylvania soon acquired a financial interest in the West Shore . The line was no stranger to such projects . Back in the seventies , when Tom Scott had dreamed of a Pennsylvania-dominated southern rail empire , he had built , or threatened to build , parallel lines in Maryland and Virginia against John W. Garrett 's ( 1820 ? 84 ) Baltimore &; Ohio and William Mahone 's ( 1826 ? 95 ) Atlantic , Mississippi , and Ohio . When Vanderbilt realized who his major antagonist was , he retaliated by going into Pennsylvania . With financial aid from Andrew Carnegie ( 1837 ? 1919 ) , who was unhappy with the existing rail monopoly of the Pennsylvania in Pittsburgh , Vanderbilt started to build the South Pennsylvania Railroad just a few miles south of the main line of the Pennsylvania . The rate war and struggle between Vanderbilt and the Pennsylvania grew so bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country 's top banker , John Pierpont Morgan ( 1837 ? 1913 ) , decided to intervene . Morgan had gained the confidence of Vanderbilt several years earlier when he had successfully sold a large block of New York Central stock in Europe . In July , 1885 , Morgan invited Vanderbilt , Chauncey Depew ( 1834 ? 1928 ) , now president of the New York Central , and George B. Roberts ( 1833 ? 97 ) , Scott 's successor as the Pennsylvania president , to a conference on his palatial yacht the " Corsair . " While the boat slowly cruised in the East River and the Sound , an agreement was finally reached . The nearly bankrupt West Shore was taken over by the New York Central , while the Vanderbilt line abandoned its partly completed road in the Keystone state to the Pennsylvania . Morgan received fees estimated at from $1,000,000 to $3,000,000 for  | running the peace conference and carrying through the necessary subsquent corporate reorganizations . He also emerged as a new force in American railroading . One of the most obnoxious types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted occasionally before the Civil War , as in the case of several anthracite lines in Pennsylvania in the middle fifties . It remained for John D. Rockefeller ( 1839 ? 1937 ) and his Standard Oil Company to make it really effective . Rockefeller 's partner , Henry Morrison Flagler ( 1830 ? 1913 ) , started to bargain for freight rebates in 1867 . Flagler was so successful that his company was soon receiving not only rebates , or refunds on its own freight costs , but also drawbacks , or refunds on the higher freight paid by competitors . In Ohio , for example , while Standard was paying 10 cents a barrel , competitors paid 35 cents a barrel , with the difference , 25 cents , being refunded to Rockefeller 's company . In a year and a half , four railroad companies paid Standard over $10,000,000 in drawbacks . Rockefeller 's oil monopoly often forced railroads to allow it the exclusive use of tank cars at a lower rate , while independent companies were relegated to wooden barrels at a higher rate . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American industry were limited in their acquisition of rebates and special rates only by their own economic leverage . William H. Vanderbilt admitted to the Hepburn Committee in New York in 1879 that all large shippers who applied for special rates normally received them . In the first six months of 1880 his company granted six thousand special rates . A public opinion already critical of railroad management was sometimes further incensed by occasional labor disputes , especially those of 1877 and 1894 . Railroad labor was far from  | fully organized in the early postwar years . The Big Four Brotherhoods ( Engineers organized in 1863 , Conductors in 1868 , Firemen and Enginemen in 1873 , and Trainmen in 1883 ) had been established mainly as mutual-insurance societies , since the risks of railroad employment made commercial insurance expensive . The trouble in 1877 started after most eastern railroads had reduced wages . The Baltimore &; Ohio in July , 1877 , announced its second 10 per cent wage cut and also started to double the length of its freight trains without increasing the size of the crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The violence along John Garrett 's line was nothing compared to the mad fury of the Pittsburgh mobs which besieged the militia in a roundhouse and eventually destroyed more than $5,000,000 worth of property . The trouble spread to Buffalo , Chicago , St. Louis , Omaha , and St. Paul . Militia , policemen , regular-army regiments , and even GAR veterans were used to stop the violence , 10,000 of them being required to reopen the main line of the Pennsylvania . The strike was broken , but the railroad workers and much of the general public could not help recalling the huge estate of the late Commodore and the dividends still being regularly paid by the B. &O.,; the New York Central , and the Pennsylvania . Another labor dispute of great intensity occurred in 1894 when thousands of rail workers halted hundreds of trains in sympathy with the Pullman strike . After peace had been restored , many of the strikers , members of Eugene V. Debs 's ( 1855 ? 1926 ) American Railway Union ( 150,000 members ) , were " blacklisted " from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stationery carrying a secret watermark showing a swan with a " broken neck . " The western farmer in the generation after the Civil ' War  | read about the Erie War , Vanderbilt 's watered stock , stockmarket operations , the rate wars , and the rebates given Standard Oil . He knew these things adversely affected him , and he also knew that he had a railroad problem much closer home . Most of the eastern rail abuses were also found in western railroads . In addition , the western farmer 's problem was aggravated by other factors . The Nebraska or Iowa farmer in the seventies faced a different situation from that which his father or grandfather had faced half a century earlier in a more easterly farming frontier . When inland transportation facilities , i.e. , the canal or turnpike , were available to the early nineteenth-century farmer , the employment of a commercial carrier was a convenience , not a necessity . If he had to , this earlier farmer could , with his own wagon or barge , move his crop to market . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a self-sufficient producer but , rather , a man producing for a distant market , he had no choice but to use the rail facilities offered at the rates ordained by a largely absentee ownership . It was the rare western farmer who had the choice of two rail routes to market . The added competitive facilities of lake , canal , or river barge , present east of the Mississippi , were totally lacking on the western plains . Furthermore , the greater distances , the relatively sparse population , and the absence of any significant industrial rail traffic all resulted in a level of average western rail rates substantially higher than those typical in the East . As Frederic Logan Paxson has pointed out , for the western farmer in the last part of the nineteenth century , transportation was a tax , a totally unavoidable one . The ultimate anger of the western farmer with the railroads was the more bitter because his need for them was so great and  | his original expectations had been so high . In the fifties and sixties , when he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap transportation that he was not only willing to permit his town and county governments to help finance them , but he also frequently mortgaged his farm to buy railroad stock . In the early rail-building in Wisconsin , 1,300 farmers in eight counties mortgaged their farms for a total of more than $1,500,000 to purchase such stock . Around Watertown , Wisconsin , they mortgaged their farms for stock in a railroad that never materialized . Even when the lines were built the farmer often found his land mortgaged , his railroad stock of little value because of excessive " water " or a reorganization , his taxes high because his township had also helped the railroad , and his transportation costs still excessive . The farmer 's transition from railroad proponent to railroad antagonist came earlier along the eastern prairie than it did farther west . The shift came in Illinois by 1869 or 1870 , while in Nebraska , which still hopefully wanted more railroads in the early seventies , the hostility did not become intense until later in the decade . In all states the bad times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the criticism of railroads and their rates . Farmers blamed low farm-produce prices on high freight rates . They told each other about the Illinois farmer who returned from town with a pair of shoes for his boy as the only purchase possible from a load of grain he had sold or the Iowa farm family who burned corn for fuel because at 15 cents a bushel it was cheaper than coal . The farmer might thus be warm , but he got hotter when he reflected that corn was selling for $1.00 a bushel in the East . The rates were high at non-competitive points ( and this was the typical small farm  | town ) because of long-and-short-haul discrimination . The grain rate from the Twin Cities to Chicago in the nineties was 12.5 cents a hundred pounds , while the rate from many Minnesota towns to St. Paul was 25 cents a hundred . And Wisconsin farmers on any one of the three competing lines into Chicago also paid a higher local rate for a shorter haul . In 1869 roads from the Mississippi to Chicago charged 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be carried by rail to the seaboard for twice as much . Rates for the shipment of cattle in Illinois were so high that farmers frequently drove their stock to the Chicago market . To compensate for low competitive long-haul rates and the frequent rate wars , the railroads were pushing up their local rates to any level that would not completely choke off business . Their rule for making rates was : " Charge all the traffic will bear . " The complaint against the long-and-short-haul discrimination was not a complete monopoly by the western farmers . Farmers at non-competitive points in New York state felt that they were farther from market than some of their well-located western competitors . A tub of butter could be sent from Elgin , Illinois , to New York City for only 30 cents , while the same tub from some points no more than 165 miles out of New York City cost 75 cents to send to market . The farmer had other complaints . He hated to be at the mercy of the local elevator company , often owned by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's grain and who could frequently afford to hold it until a profitable price rise came along . Nor did the farmer like the fancy prices he paid at the local country store , prices high in part because the merchant was in the same freight-rate bind as the farmer .  | Farmer and local merchant alike , in fact all the little people , were unhappy about the abuse of railroad passes . All sections of the country complained about the influence railroads exercised over public officials through the universal practice of granting free passes to congressmen , judges , sheriffs , assessors , and even town officials . The railroads were just as generous with members of the press , and they also favored big shippers and agents of large concerns . In the generation after the Civil War this abuse grew rapidly . By 1897 the railroads of North Carolina were giving out 100,000 passes a year at an estimated annual revenue loss of $325,000 . Paying passengers found it difficult to conceal their disgust when they found their seatmate to be a " deadhead , " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad officials were well aware of the public resentment . James M. Walker ( 1820-81 ) , president of the Burlington in the early seventies , wrote his vicepresident : " I think the grant of a free pass to make one friend creates half a dozen enemies . " But the friends were frequently very valuable . Railroads saved thousands of dollars in taxes with passes given county assessors and auditors . As the custom became intrenched , public officials came to view the annual pass as a vested right . This railroad evil of mixed blackmail and bribery remained to plague the public until it was finally prohibited by the Hepburn Act of 1906 . The main source of railroad abuses and difficulties in the late nineteenth century was their freight rates . The inherent complexity of the subject contributed to the difficulty . An author reviewing the problem early in the twentieth century claimed that there were about fifteen thousand principles governing the movement of interstate railroad freight traffic . This was perhaps an exaggeration , but , clearly , as the carrier ,  | the shipper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges for a traffic of unlimited variety moving over dozens of railroads between hundreds of communities and trading centers , any thought of a simple solution was pure folly . By 1900 a great variety of principles or theories of ratemaking had appeared . Such rate theories as cost of the service , flat rate by distance , flat rate regardless of distance , what the traffic will bear , keep everybody in business , value of the service , value of the commodity , and the general public interest were advanced by various interested parties . Of the several theories , the railroads favored charging as much as the traffic would permit . At the turn of the century Charles A. Prouty ( 1853-1921 ) , member of the Interstate Commerce Commission , asked a railroad traffic official the basis on which his rates were made . The official replied : " To be perfectly honest , we get all we can , and even that is too little . " A more reasonable and equitable rate would be one which considered the interests of the shipper , the railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimum of the out-of-pocket costs to the railroad and the maximum of the total value of the service to the shipper , the rate would finally be determined by the conditions of competition , the value of the commodity , and the importance of its movement to society . Such ideals in the making of rates were obviously not present in the generation after the Civil ' War . Rate discrimination took three forms in the period : between classes of traffic or freight , between places , and between persons . There was nothing bad in the principle of charging more for some commodities than others . Dry goods or general merchandise could obviously absorb a higher rate by weight than such goods as lumber , coal , or grain . There was also some justification for  | some of the place discrimination . Clearly writing from the railroad point of view , General Edward P. Alexander ( 1835-1910 ) , president of the Georgia Railroad , answered critics of the long-and-short-haul discrimination in the Commercial and Financial Chronicle in 1887 : " None of these discriminations made between places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of the railroad to discriminate , but arise from the fact that nature has discriminated by giving the river town natural transportation . " Much of the local or place discrimination in the period , whether due to " nature " or not , was excessive and unjustified . Except for lower rates given for quantity shipments , there was no justification at all for the many cases of rate discrimination between persons . Where special rates were given , they were generally secret , often marked by rank favoritism , and often accentuated inequalities , given as they were to those who needed them least . Before the Civil War several eastern states had supervised their railroads , but never strictly . Railroad commissions or regulatory bodies were established in Rhode Island in 1839 , New Hampshire in 1844 , Connecticut in 1853 , Vermont in 1855 , and Maine in 1858 . In general the supervision was established to check on the compliance with the railroad charters , to provide for just apportionment of interstate receipts , and to reduce the incidence of railroad accidents . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while perhaps rarely the concern of state agencies , was a heated issue in many localities . In Vermont in the fifties the legislature decided that conductors were to read a passage of Scripture to passengers traveling on Sunday trains . Erastus Fairbanks ( 1792-1864 ) , scale manufacturer , one-time governor of Vermont , and a strict observer of the Sabbath , made certain that  | no trains ran on Sunday on his road , the St. Johnsbury and Lake Champlain . Keepers of the Sabbath also stopped train service on Sunday in Altoona , Pennsylvania . In Illinois the president of Knox College was less successful when he attempted to stop Sunday train operations through Galesburg . The railroads started to give the clergy passes , the Civil War years saw little agitation against Sunday trains , and after the war the railroads tended to run trains how and when they pleased . After the Civil War , complaints against more serious aspects of the railroad problem led to a growing demand for regulation . President Grant urged Congress in 1872 to investigate the problem of cheaper freight rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , headed by William Windom ( 1827 ? 91 ) of Minnesota , in its 1874 report criticized the railroads for several abuses but specifically recommended little more than the construction of several new water routes to the Atlantic coast . In 1879 the New York legislature decided to investigate the railroad problem , and a committee under the chairmanship of Alonzo B. Hepburn ( 1846 ? 1922 ) obtained much information , especially on the evils of rebates and rate discrimination . In spite of the public outcry at the revelations in these reports , the eastern states seemed satisfied to depend upon publicity and the force of public opinion . Most railroad regulation by eastern states in the seventies and eighties followed the pattern set by the Massachusetts commission of 1869 , an agency largely advisory in nature . It remained for the western and southern states to take more positive action in railroad regulation . The first significant regulation of railroads after the Civil War appeared in the seventies in several prairie farming states .  | The railroad laws that were enacted in the upper Mississippi Valley in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were possible only through the active support of members of the Grange . The National Grange of the Patrons of Husbandry was founded in 1867 by Oliver H. Kelley ( 1826-1913 ) , a Minnesota farmer who had become a clerk in the Bureau of Agriculture in Washington , D.C. Kelley resigned his Washington post in 1868 to devote his full time to the establishment of local Granges . The work was slow and discouraging , but by the end of 1869 he had set up thirty-seven local Granges in his own state of Minnesota and the next year had units in eight other states . At first the organization was intended to be only social and educational in nature , but the hard times of the seventies expanded not only the size but also the objectives of the group . By 1875 , when the Grange had blossomed to 20,000 local Granges and 800,000 members , its attention had clearly shifted to economic and political issues . As Grange members listened to home-grown orators recite the oppressions farmers suffered at the hands of the " non-producers , " their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall of their dimly lit hall . The poster showed eight men in characteristic poses : " I pray for all , " said the parson ; " I trade for all , " said the merchant ; " I plead for all , " said the lawyer ; " I legislate for all , " said the statesman ; " I prescribe for all , " said the physician ; " I fight for all , " said the soldier ; " I carry for all , " said the railroad owner ; and in the center stood the farmer , who said , " And I PAY for all . " By the seventies the farmer was tired of paying . Stringent railroad regulation at the state level began in Illinois with legislation in 1871 and 1873 . The legislation set  | up a board of railroad and warehouse commissioners , established maximum passenger fares , provided that freight rates should be based entirely on distance , and finally , in 1873 , made it the duty of the new commissioners to prepare a schedule of reasonable maximum freight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtaining this railroad legislation , the number of local Granges in Illinois in 1873 being exceeded only by the number in Iowa . Minnesota also passed legislation in 1871 fixing railroad rates and providing for a railroad commissioner . Finding its railroad laws difficult to enforce , in 1874 the state legislature modeled their regulation on the Illinois law of 1873 . Regulation in Minnesota was more difficult than in Illinois because no single set of rates could equitably be applied in a state which varied from regions of heavy population to areas that were still mainly frontier . In 1874 Granger railroad legislation was enacted in both Iowa and Wisconsin . When Iowa had earlier turned the land grants obtained from the federal government over to her new railroads , it had been with the reservation that the companies would be subject to subsequent legislative action . The Iowa Acts of 1874 were certainly satisfactory to the farm group , since the majority of the members of the lower house were Grangers . The legislation was carefully drawn and appears to have been generally enforced , since the railroad managers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wisconsin the Potter Law of 1874 established many railroad freight rates that were unreasonably low . On the advice of eminent legal counsel , Alexander Mitchell , president of the Chicago , Milwaukee &; St. Paul , and Albert Keep ( 1826-1907 ) , president of the Chicago &; North Western , wrote the governor that they intended to ignore the legislation . The state  | forced the roads to comply with the law , but in 1876 the law was modified to the general satisfaction of the railroad interests . In the late seventies or early eighties Granger agitation for railroad regulation was also successful in such neighboring prairie states as Nebraska , Kansas , and Missouri . In 1879 Georgia set up a railroad commission to establish rates , and in the same year a new constitution for California provided that an elective commission should fix maximum railroad rates . Western farmers and the Grange had brought regulation to the railroads . Western railroads vigorously resisted the enforcement of the Granger laws in a variety of ways . In the courts they argued that since their business was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The railroad lawyers claimed that the states , which had granted railroad charters ( which included the right to set rates and fares ) , could not now fix rates themselves without being guilty of violating the original contract . They cited the Dartmouth College case of 1819 in support of their contention . In the contest , the Grangers had votes ; the railroads possessed money . While there were undoubtedly more charges of bribery than actual cases , many railroad favors were received by willing legislators . In Iowa passes were refused those politicians who were no longer friends of the railroads . In Minnesota and Wisconsin the railroads made their compliance with the new laws as obnoxious as possible . In its zeal to have uniform passenger fares , the St. Paul and Pacific raised its rates between Minneapolis and St. Paul from three to five cents . In Wisconsin the railroads obeyed the Potter Law by giving the public the poorer service of " Potter cars , Potter rails , and Potter time . " Railroad methods were successful , and soon not only was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softened in several other states as well . Even as the railroads were winning modest legislative victories , the United States Supreme Court , in a series of decisions in 1876 , decided the basic issue of laissez faire versus public regulation in favor of the Grangers . In the first of the Granger cases , Munn v. Illinois , the Court upheld the Illinois law of 1871 , which fixed maximum rates for the storage of grain . At the same time , the Court decided in Peik v. Chicago &; North Western R. R. and Chicago , Burlington &; Quincy R. R. v. Iowa that not only could the states fix maximum railroad freight and passenger rates but in the absence of national legislation this regulation could apply to interstate commerce . Only in the dissenting opinion of Justice Stephen J. Field ( 1816 ? 99 ) in the case of Munn v. Illinois was it argued that the act in question was invalid because it amounted to a deprivation of property without " due process of law . " In principle at least , the Granger victory for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decade of the eighties railroad regulation moved from the state to the national scene . A bill seeking the creation of a federal railroad commission had been introduced in Congress as early as 1871 , and John H. Reagan ( 1818 ? 1905 ) , former Confederate postmaster general from Texas , in 1878 had managed to get his regulation measure through the House . In 1880 , James B. Weaver ( 1833 ? 1912 ) complained in Congress that railroads in Iowa were succeeding in shifting litigation from state to federal courts by pointing to their incorporation in another state . Voices were being raised that railroad regulation was too big a problem for the states . The railroads themselves were expanding greatly , both in mileage and in con- centration of control , in the decade . The depression of 1884 ? 85 speeded up this trend toward consolidation . Between 1880 and 1888 some 425 different corporations , or nearly a quarter of all railroad companies , by lease , purchase , or merger , came under the control of other lines . Noting the growing railroad problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1883 , urged that Congress act to protect the public against railroad abuses . In 1885 a special Senate committee headed by Shelby M. Cullom ( 1829-1914 ) , former governor of Illinois , conducted an investigation of railroad practices . The final report of the Cullom Committee in January , 1886 , listed all the familiar abuses of unreasonably high local rates ; discriminations between persons , places , and types of freight ; special secret rebates and drawbacks ; passes ; watered stock , causing excessive capitalization ; and managements that were extravagant and wasteful . The report recommended the creation of an independent commission to regulate the nation 's railroads . A second event in 1886 also indicated that federal action was near . In October in the so-called Wabash case ( Wabash , St. Louis and Pacific Railway v. Illinois ) the Supreme Court decided that a state could not regulate any rates on shipments passing beyond its own borders . The regulation of interstate commerce was to be left to the federal government . The fresh evidence of railroad abuses , plus the blow at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill in the Senate and the Reagan bill in the House were molded by conferences into the Interstate Commerce Act , which was signed by President Cleveland on February 4 , 1887 . The Interstate Commerce Act , in language perhaps deliberately vague , required that all interstate rates be " reason- able and just " and prohibited the familiar competitive practices of rebates , drawbacks , and pools . It required the railroads to publish their rate schedules , a practice rarely observed , though normally required in most of their charters , and directed the roads not only to post their schedules " in every depot or station " but also to file them with the government . Higher charges for non-competitive short hauls than for competitive long hauls were also prohibited . A five-man Interstate Commerce Commission was created to administer the Act and enforce its prohibitions . The Commission could hear complaints from shippers , examine witnesses , and look into the records and books of railroad companies . It could also demand annual reports from the railroads and could insist , after a reasonable period for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad accounting . While the Commission could not fix railroad rates , it could issue a cease-and-desist order for the carrier to reduce its charges . If the railroad refused to comply , the Commission could only enforce obedience through the federal courts . The public reception of the railroad regulation of 1887 was generally favorable . The Commercial and Financial Chronicle called the legislation " paternalism in an extreme form , " but the Chicago Tribune held that the railroad pool managers were getting only what they deserved . Many railroad men were not too perturbed as the Act neared passage . While the final conferences were taking place , James C. Clarke , president of the Illinois Central , wrote Stuyvesant Fish : " The only thing left for Rail Roads to do is to largely increase the long haul or through rates . Act honestly with each other and be patient . " Railroad stocks even advanced upon passage of the Act . Much criticism of the Act was avoided when President  | Cleveland promptly appointed five capable men to the Commission . By the end of March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Republican judge from Michigan and one-time railroad receiver , to head the Commission ; the other members were William R. Morrison ( 1825 ? 1909 ) of Illinois , Augustus Schoonmaker ( 1828 ? 94 ) of New York , Aldace F. Walker ( 1842 ? 1901 ) of Vermont , and Walter L. Bragg ( 1838 ? 91 ) of Alabama . The Commercial and Financial Chronicle was happy to note that all the appointees were honest men with legal training and that three of them were familiar with railroad problems . The " era of good feelings " toward the new Interstate Commerce Act and the Commission which was to enforce it was of short duration . Qualified though the new Commissioners were , the task of applying the law to the complicated railroad rate structure was like " cutting a path through a jungle . " Just what were " reasonable and just " railroad rates ? When shippers complained about a given rate , the necessary examination of connecting customs and issues might require a long series of readjustments , which would make a final decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the long delays in the proceedings . The Commission frequently found that witnesses were reluctant to testify or that shippers were unwilling to complain about discrimination . The major flaw in the total regulation lay in the lack of any effective means for the Commission to enforce the decisions it might make . Its cease-and-desist orders were often ignored by the carriers , and any resulting court action was slowed by appeals or demands for new hearings . In the nineties the average court case lasted for four years , and many dragged on much longer . In 1896 two decisions of the Supreme Court appeared to be  | giving the green light to the Commission . In the first case the Court upheld an act of Congress giving the Commission the power to force railroads to testify before it ( Brown v. Walker ) and in the second held out the hope of faster future proceedings by admitting that the courts should pass only upon the procedure and not the substance of each case ( Social Circle case ) . But the great majority of railroad rate cases favored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Court between 1887 and 1905 , fifteen were in favor of the carrier and against the Commission . Decisions in 1897 and 1901 conclusively held that the Commission had no ratemaking power and also that it possessed no power to prohibit the discrimination in which more was charged for a short haul than for a long one . Clearly , the experience of the Interstate Commerce Commission in the first fifteen years of its existence justified the prediction of Richard S. Olney ( 1835-1917 ) , corporation lawyer and later Attorney General under Cleveland . In 1892 , Olney wrote a railroad friend advising him not to ask for the repeal of the act : " It satisfies the popular clamor for a government supervision of the railroads , at the same time that such supervision is almost entirely nominal . " Nominal as this first major break with laissez faire was , it was to be the foundation for later , more effective regulation . The more stringent regulation that came in the twentieth century was the result of two forces : first , the fresh evidence of increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the appearance on the American political scene of the Progressive Movement . In the nineties and the early twentieth century the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 was no more successful in curbing railroad consolidation  | than the Interstate Commerce Act had been in establishing an effective regulation . What had been in the early nineties a large number of independent systems was brought in a decade and a half into six or eight major combinations . The severe Panic of 1893 pushed many roads into default , and by mid1894 a quarter of the nation 's railroads , representing over 40,000 miles and $2,500,000,000 of capital , were in the hands of receivers . This started the process of combination , but consolidation went into high gear some 25,000 miles of line shifted to the control of the expanding combinations . By 1906 nearly two-thirds of the nation 's rail mileage of 225,000 miles was in the control of seven groups : ( 1 ) the Vanderbilt roads ( more than 22,500 miles ) , including the New York Central system and the Chicago &; North Western ; ( 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the B. &O.; and the Chesapeake &; Ohio in addition to the parent line ; ( 3 ) the Morgan roads ( 18,000 miles ) , controlling the Erie , the newly organized Southern , and half a dozen other southern lines ; ( 4 ) the Gould roads , ( 17,000 miles ) , managed by George J. Gould ( 1864 ? 1923 ) , son of Jay , and including the Missouri Pacific and other southwestern lines ; ( 5 ) the Rock Island system ( 15,000 miles ) , put together by William H. Moore ( 1848 ? 1923 ) and important in the Mississippi Valley ; ( 6 ) the Hill roads ( 21,000 miles ) , including the Great Northern , Northern Pacific , and Burlington ; and ( 7 ) the Harriman lines ( 25,000 miles ) , consisting mainly of the Union Pacific , the Southern Pacific , and the Illinois Central . Much of this concentrated management was under banker control , since such houses as J. P. Morgan and Company and Kuhn , Loeb and Company had invested heavily in the defaulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role in reorganizing the Southern , the Erie , the Northern Pacific , and the B. &O.; after the panic . He also had become the banker for the Hill roads of the Northwest . Much of the new concentration of railroad control had been accompanied by financial manipulations so unscrupulous that they would have excited the envy of the elder Gould , Drew , or Commodore Vanderbilt . Edward H. Harriman ( 1848-1909 ) , George J. Gould , and James Stillman ( 1850-1918 ) , head of the National City Bank of New York , were top men in a syndicate which financially ravished the Chicago and Alton between 1898 and 1905 . The once well-run road was ruined as its capital structure was expanded from $34,000,000 to $114,000,000 , with the insiders taking a private profit of at least $23,000,000 . William H. Moore , professional promoter of corporations from Chicago , was just as ruthless when his syndicate looted the Rock Island in the same years . The Moore group managed with $5,000,000 of borrowed money and the clever exchange of securities between holding companies ultimately to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood at $1,500,000,000 . While the elder Morgan was normally a sober manager of rail properties , the financial ruin he brought to the New York , New Haven &; Hartford between 1903 and 1913 was worthy of a Gould or a Moore . The ICC report to the Senate in 1914 spoke of the " loose , extravagant and improvident " management of Morgan , condemned his " financial legerdemain , " and criticized the " extensive use of a paid lobby " and the " profligate " use of free passes . Clearly , the financial mismanagement of American railroads in the early twentieth century deserved additional attention .  | The turn of the century saw continued and widespread railroad rate discrimination . Especially after 1890 , there was a general return by the railroads to the practice of rebating , in spite of the law . In addition to the old form of rebate , several convenient substitutes were invented . Preferred shippers received the same advantage through overbilling ( the railroad 's paying damages for the loss of non-existent items ) or underbilling ( carrying a larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storage of a shipper 's goods or elevator rebates and allowances were also used in lieu of the straight rebate . The denial of fair and equal facilities , such as the refusal to furnish cars to a shipper , was a way of discriminating against a shipper not in favor with the railroad . In 1903 Governor Robert M. La Follette ( 1855 ? 1925 ) of Wisconsin began an investigation of the railroads in his state . He discovered that between 1897 and 1903 rebates and unlawful discriminations in Wisconsin amounted to more than $7,000,000 , with every major line guilty of these practices . Rebating was found to have continued even after the passage of the Elkins Act , although many carriers had shifted to the new technique of issuing " midnight tariffs , " special low rates purposely printed to favor a large shipper and then revoked once the shipment had been made . Still another factor which favored a demand for a tighter railroad regulation was the definite increase in average railroad freight rates which started about 1900 . The rise in rates was in great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostile public it seemed to be a result of the growing rail consolidation . The revival of railroad regulation came with the Progressive Movement and with the appearance in the White House of a new and energetic president , Theodore Roosevelt ( 1858  | 1919 ) . Roosevelt first challenged the railroads when he had Attorney General Philander C. Knox ( 1853 ? 1921 ) start a suit under the Sherman Act to dissolve the Northern Securities Company . This giant holding company for three major northwestern lines ? the Northern Pacific , the Great Northern , and the Burlington ? had been put together by Harriman and Hill after they had fought each other for the possession of the Burlington . Harriman , already a dominant figure in the Illinois Central , had acquired the dilapidated Union Pacific in 1897 as it was facing foreclosure and reorganization . Having rehabilitated the Union Pacific , Harriman next acquired a working control over the Southern Pacific in 1901 after the death of Collis P. Huntington , the last survivor of the Big Four . He next sought to gain entry into Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jim Hill , backed by Morgan , reached out to add the Burlington to his two northern roads . The resulting battle in Wall Street finally ended when the antagonists joined to create the Northern Securities Company . In 1904 the Supreme Court , in outlawing the holding company , ordered the dissolution of the Northern Securities Company . However , the ownership of the stock of the three railroads changed very little and the Burlington remained in the hands of the Great Northern and the Northern Pacific . Roosevelt was more successful in two pieces of railroad legislation passed in 1903 . The Expedition Act of that year sped up court procedure for the handling of suits brought by the government under either the Sherman Act of 1890 or the earlier Interstate Commerce Act . A few days later Congress passed the Elkins Act , which attempted to strengthen the prohibition of railroad rebates . The new law also made railroads , as well as company officials , liable to prosecution .  | The first major change in federal railroad regulation since 1887 came in Roosevelt 's second term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1904 , and again a year later , Roosevelt called railroad legislation " a paramount issue " and asked that the Interstate Commerce Commission be empowered to establish reasonable railroad rates and that the carriers be prevented from granting rate favors or issuing free passes . The railroads seemed to be ready to yield to the growing demands for more effective regulation . In December , 1905 , the presidents of the Pennsylvania , the New York Central , and the Reading railroads announced that as of January 1 , 1906 , passes would be given only to their own employees . So great was the demand for legislation that when the Hepburn Act was approved in June , 1906 , only seven votes were cast against it in the House and three in the Senate . The Hepburn Act extended the powers of the Interstate Commerce Commission to other common carriers , such as express , sleeping-car , and pipeline companies , and increased the size of the Commission from five to seven members ( raised to nine in 1917 ) . It abolished the granting of passes ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and strengthened the law against rebates . The so-called commodity clause insisted that railroads separate themselves from such enterprises as company-owned coal mines . Most important was the fact that the new legislation empowered the Commission to establish " just and reasonable " maximum rates , and thus the Hepburn Act became a landmark in the development of federal railroad regulation . More regulation came under Roosevelt 's successor , William Howard Taft ( 1857-1930 ) , who had never had any great love for the railroads . Before he became President he had written that they were monopolies run by eight or nine men who were  | " exceedingly lawless in spirit . " As President , Taft was especially anxious to see that any new legislation included the creation of a new " Commerce Court " to hear appeals from ICC rate decisions . The Mann-Elkins bill , enacted in June , 1910 , by a combination of Democrats and insurgent Republicans , established such a court and also gave the Commission jurisdiction over telephone , telegraph , and cable companies . The legislation greatly strengthened the 1887 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar circumstances and conditions , " words which had allowed the Supreme Court to make the original provision useless . The Mann-Elkins Act also permitted the Commission to suspend any new rates for as long as ten months , with the burden of proof as to the reasonableness of the proposed rates being placed upon the carrier . When the new Commerce Court seemed to be favoring the railroads and working against the ICC , Congress refused to vote funds for its operation and it went out of existence in 1913 . A year earlier the Panama Canal Act made it unlawful for any railroad to control or have any interest in common carriers by water operating through the Canal or elsewhere , where the carriers might be competing for traffic with the railroad . Finally , the Railroad Valuation Act of March 1 , 1913 , gave Robert M. La Follette a law he had wanted since 1906 . The legislation required the ICC to assess the value of all railroad property . In reviewing the financial history of each line , the original cost , reproduction cost , depreciation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gifts received were to be considered . It was expected that ultimately the Commission could thus establish rates , not upon a basis of watered stock  | and inflated capitalization , but , rather , upon the true value of the operating properties of the railroad . Much progress had been made in railroad regulation at the outbreak of World War I. In the early twentieth century , Americans swept up by the Progressive Movement were in no mood to have anything less than an effective and rather complete regulation of the nation 's railroads . They remembered the stealing , the watered stock , the financial chicanery , and the manipulations of Littlefield , Vanderbilt , Gould , and Brice . All these men and their comrades in corruption had passed on by 1900 , but in some instances their children and grandchildren were carrying on in the same tradition . The new regulation owed much to thousands of farmers who were once individually inarticulate in the political arena but who later became collectively powerful enough , as Grangers , to create the first stringent railroad regulation at the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and regulations was , the several amendments to the original federal legislation of 1887 had established a comprehensive system of control by the second decade of the twentieth century . True , the total legislation did not provide much in the way of assuring an adequate rail service , nor were there yet any legal provisions looking toward real supervision of the carrier 's financial structure , but the federal and state regulations were being enforced by commissions of the mandatory type which possessed full powers to stop discrimination and to enforce reasonable railroad rates . There were certainly many honest railroad men in the halfcentury of expanding railroad service between the Civil War and the First World War . The typical railroad manager was  | probably just as honest as the average businessman in the generation after Appomattox . But it was a generation when the typical businessman felt that if he succeeded in making money in his business , raised a proper family , and contributed to his church , he had fully discharged his duties to society . Individual material success was more important than a social conscience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government forced such a conscience upon the railroads and their managers , the need for a continuing and comprehensive regulation was already beginning to lessen . In the teens new competitive overland-transportation facilities loomed large on the horizon . It was possible in 1914 to travel from Chicago to Utica , New York , by the new inter-urban facilities ; in 1917 nearly five million automobiles were registered in the nation ; and in 1918 the government started airmail service between New York and Washington . New forces were preparing to challenge the long-time dominance of the railroad .  | In the half-century before World War I , American railroads experienced three parallel and concurrent developments . Railroads helped settle and civilize the western half of the United States in the decades after the Civil War . As we have just noted , the railroad also played a full role in the shift from a laissez faire to a partially regulated economy in the years between the first Granger legislation and the climax of the Progressive Movement . In the same fifty years , as they expanded from an eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 254,000 miles in 1916 , American railroads , in a third development , experienced a new integration and uniformity of operation . The resulting increases in efficiency brought by these changes and by a host of other technical advances permitted lower railroad rates . The use of steel rails , the adoption of standard gauge , the utilization of faster and more powerful locomotives pulling longer and heavier trains , the introduction of standard time , better brakes ,  | and improved couplers all helped to create a truly national rail network . In the post ? Civil War years railroads made a generous contribution to the expanding industrialization in America . They played a full role in the growth of urban population , the extension of regional into national markets , and the appearance of our modern interdependent economy . Perhaps of first importance in the physical maturity achieved by American railroads was the extension of the rail network . This expanded from 35,000 miles in 1865 to 53,000 miles in 1870 ; 93,000 miles in 1880 ; 164,000 miles in 1890 ; 193 , - 000 miles in 1900 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an all-time high of 254,000 miles in 1916 . New track was laid at an unprecedented rate . In the three decades before the Civil War ( 1830 ? 60 ) only four years , in the prosperous fifties ( 1853 , 1856 , 1857 , and 1858 ) , had seen as much as 2,000 miles of new line constructed annually . In a comparable period after the war ( 1865 ? 95 ) only four years ( 1865 , 1866 , 1875 , and 1895 ) had less than 2,000 miles of new track laid yearly . While the average annual construction in the half-century after the Civil War was well over 4,000 miles ( or an average of more than 13 miles per working day ) , the rate of building varied greatly from period to period . Less than 4,000 miles of new line had been laid during the four years of the Civil War . In the eight years after the war ( 1865 ? 73 ) the national network was doubled to a total of 70,000 miles of line , with more than 19,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through 1872 . The Panic of 1873 and the resulting rash of rail receiverships slowed construction in the remaining years of the decade to an average annual increase of less than 2,400 miles . The decade of the eighties was the period of greatest rail- road construction . Unmarred by any major depression , it saw 71,000 miles of new line built , a figure which was more than the construction of any two preceding decades in railroad history . A full recovery from the 1873 depression was indicated in 1880 , when 6,700 miles of line were laid , but the next year ( 1881 ) saw a record 9,800 miles of construction , surpassing the previous 1871 high of 7,300 miles . The year 1882 set still another record , with 11,569 miles built in twelve months . The pace slowed in the middle eighties , but even in the low year for the decade , 1885 , nearly 3,000 miles of line were added to the national rail system . A new pickup in construction occurred in 1886 , and in 1887 an all-time high of 12,878 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trackage for the decade was located in states west of the Mississippi , with construction being most active in the Southwest . Southern states ( south of the Potomac and Ohio rivers and east of the Mississippi ) added new mileage in the decade much more rapidly than any of the other older regions , doubling their rail network in the ten years to a total of over 32,000 miles . Railroad construction never again reached the hectic rates of the eighties . The early nineties saw fairly rapid building , but the depression beginning in 1893 brought a decline that was reminiscent of the middle and late seventies . Less than 30,000 miles of road was added to the national network in the decade . In the first years of the twentieth century the pace of construction increased somewhat , and between 1900 and 1907 nearly 33,000 miles of new road were built , reaching a total of 230,000 miles of line . After the Panic of 1907 , business in general had a rapid recovery , but the returning optimism did not extend significantly to the area of railroad-building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | until by 1917 the rate of building was slower than that of abandonment . At the end of 1916 the nation 's railroads had reached a record high of 254,037 miles of road . As the rail network increased eightfold between the beginning of the Civil War and World War I , the rate of increase varied greatly from region to region . As has been fully noted , the western expansion was the most rapid , capturing the headlines and the country 's attention every time a celebration marked the completion of another route to the Pacific . As could be expected , the slowest increase was in New England , an area that had achieved a fairly complete rail service more than a decade before the Civil War . New England trackage little more than doubled in the half-century . Only five states in the nation failed at least to triple their rail mileage from 1860 to 1910 , and they were all in New England . Maine alone had a rate of construction that approached the national pattern . Some of the increase there was caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Railroad , a line that connected Maine 's largest and most northern county , Aroostook , with the rest of the state . By 1900 this new 320-mile line was not only serving the new paper mills that had come into the spruce forests of the state but was also helping the Maine potato invade new markets across the nation . Perhaps the very absence of major railroad construction in New England hastened the trend toward consolidation among the many short roads . In any event , by 1900 , half a dozen lines accounted for four-fifths of the region 's mileage , and two systems controlled more than half . The New York , New Haven &; Hartford , known as the " Consolidated " back in 1872 when Connecticut had finally permitted the 63-mile New  | York and New Haven and the 78-mile Hartford and New Haven to combine , had grown by 1900 to a system of over 2,000 miles . Despite its rapid growth the line still had a sound financial structure , was paying good dividends from a traffic that was mainly passenger , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1905 ) , as president . Morgan had not yet come to the New Haven . The Boston and Maine was the second major New England railroad . The B. and M. in 1900 had a system of owned and leased lines that totaled over 1,700 miles , had a major financial interest in the Maine Central ( 823 miles ) , and had a growing interest in the Fitchburg ( 457 miles ) . Lucius Tuttle ( 1846 ? 1914 ) was president of both the B. and M. and the Maine Central from the middle nineties until 1910 . At the turn of the century Tuttle 's Boston and Maine had so simple and chaste a financial structure ( without benefit of watered stock , second mortgages , or refunding certificates ) that E. H. Harriman , upon hearing of it , was reported to have exclaimed : " Great Scott ! Is there anything like that left out of doors ? " In the central trunk-line region of the nation the rate of new construction in the decades after the Civil War was somewhat more rapid than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1910 the railroads of the five Middle Atlantic states ( New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Delaware , and Maryland ) expanded from over 6,000 miles to nearly 24,000 miles of line . To the west , in the five states of the Old Northwest , the expansion in the five decades was more than a fivefold increase to a total of nearly 45,000 miles in 1910 . In the area between the eastern seaports of New York , Philadelphia , and Baltimore and the inland city of Chicago , railroad dominance was naturally held at the turn of the century by the two giant systems , the New York Central ( 10,000 miles ) and the Penn- sylvania ( 10,000 miles ) . Smaller but still important through routes were the B. &O.; ( 3,100 miles ) and the Erie ( 2,200 miles ) . Other small but important lines in the East included the Philadelphia &; Reading ( 1,900 miles ) , the Lehigh Valley ( 1,400 miles ) , and the Delaware , Lackawanna &; Western ( 950 miles ) . West of Chicago the major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River . South of the Ohio and Potomac rivers railroad-building after the Civil War was more rapid than in any region except the West . In the fifty years after 1860 , eight of the eleven Confederate states increased their mileage at least fivefold , and the area as a whole expanded its trackage more than sevenfold to a total of 63,000 miles in 1910 . At least one of the states , Texas , whose 14,000 miles of line in 1910 ranked her an easy first in the nation , was almost more western than southern . But southern rail expansion was significant . Possessing but a meager rail network in 1861 , the South had little opportunity to build much additional mileage in the next decade and a half of war and Reconstruction , but in the eighties southern states built much more rapidly than the nation as a whole . By the turn of the century five lines accounted for a majority of the mileage south of the Ohio and Potomac rivers and east of the Mississippi . Largest of the five was the new Southern Railway ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan out of the financial wreckage of the Richmond and West Point Terminal ? Richmond and Danville system . Oldest of the five lines was the Louisville &; Nashville ( 5,000 miles ) , dominated by its long-time president , the crusty but capable Milton Hannibal Smith ( 1836 ? 1921 ) , a man who hated passenger business decades before it became common for some  | railroads to attempt to avoid such traffic . The Atlantic Coast Line and the Seaboard Air Line were the newest of the major systems . Shortly after the Civil War , William T. Walters ( 1820-94 ) , Baltimore merchant , aided by his friend , Benjamin F. Newcomer ( 1827-95 ) , Baltimore banker , became interested in several coastal railroads running from Weldon , North Carolina , southward to Augusta , Georgia . In 1902 the system , now known as the Atlantic Coast Line ( 2,100 miles ) , was nearly doubled in length when it acquired the Plant System , a network of fourteen railroads in Georgia , Florida , and Alabama put together by the late Henry Bradley Plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skelton Williams ( 1865-1926 ) , a young Richmond banker , completed the organization of the Seaboard Air Line ( 2,600 miles ) , a system whose route basically paralleled that of the Atlantic Coast Line from Virginia to Florida . In 1900 , with 2,300 miles of its extensive system located south of Cairo , the Illinois Central was also a major southern railroad . Nearly as significant as the physical extension of the railway network was the greater integration and operating efficiency achieved by the adoption of a host of technological improvements in the generation after the Civil ' War . The existing rail network in 1865 was certainly not integrated or really very efficient . The lack of physical rail connections in several cities and the absence of bridges at wide rivers kept the system from being a complete network . The diversity of gauge , especially in the South , also made impossible the cross-country shipment of freight without break of bulk . Manual braking and coupling of the cars made railroad operation both dangerous and slow . Iron rails , wooden bridges , light locomotives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freight ship- ments . The crazy-quilt pattern of hundreds of different local times and inadequacies in train control and signaling also slowed rail traffic . Much of this was to change in the quarter of a century after the war . As the American economy gradually shifted from a merchant to an industrial and finance capitalism , more and more American businessmen changed their thinking about railroad service . Railroads ceased to be thought of as agencies to serve the provincial or regional needs of a particular city and were viewed instead as facilities which , once co-ordinated , might serve larger national needs . Such a shift in the function and role of the railroad was obviously needed as the American economy grew with almost explosive force in the late nineteenth century . Behind Great Britain , Germany , and France in both coal and pig-iron production at the outbreak of the Civil War , the United States had easily moved into first position before 1900 . As the American rail network became a more unified and efficient transportation system , it significantly contributed to this new industrial dominance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system came at the close of the Civil War when a number of railroads participated in fast-freight lines . The fast-freight line offered the shipper the advantage of greater speed between two major cities without the inconvenience of having to break bulk at normal transfer points . The latter feature was possible because the fast-freight lines , as independent stock companies , owned their own rolling stock and could operate their special trains over the trackage of several different railroads . Serious abuses often appeared in the new lines , some of which had started to operate even before the Civil War . The new fast service tended to draw to itself the high-class , higher-rate freight ,  | leaving to the railroad only the lower-class , less profitable business . Also , since railroad officials were frequently financially involved in the new freight companies , a dualism of control developed , which brought criticism from ordinary railroad stockholders , as well as occasional inquiries by a legislature or railroad commission . These abuses were largely overcome with the appearance in 1866 of " co-operative " fast-freight lines . The co-operative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a separate company but simply an administrative pool , with each of the participating roads contributing cars according to its length or share of traffic . Soon every major trunk road was in one or more of the new combinations . By 1874 they were carrying the bulk of the nation 's through railroad freight , and eventually there were probably forty different lines . The New York Central was in the Red , White , and Blue lines ; the Pennsylvania worked with the Star Union , the National , and the Empire lines ; the Great Western Dispatch was used by the Erie ; while the Baltimore &; Ohio reached St. Louis via the Continental Fast Freight Line . South of the Ohio the Green Line , organized in 1868 , had twenty-one member railroads by 1873 . All the new co-operative lines offered shippers through bills of lading . They were so efficient that by the middle seventies the bulk of the grain traffic to Boston had shifted from water to rail . Competition between the new lines grew in the eighties . In 1891 Boston was served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the sixties fast freights , slow freights , and even passenger trains , were still plagued by a pair of devices , the hand brake and the link-and-pin coupler , which kept all rail service slow and hazardous . The link-and-pin coupler was so arranged that  | the brakeman had to stand between the cars in order to steer the link into the socket and drop the pin . This job was so dangerous that brakemen were often recognized by missing fingers or a crippled hand . Often a yardmaster , when interviewing a boomer brakeman for a job , would be satisfied that the applicant was an " old-timer " if he could show one or two missing fingers . Manual braking of the cars was equally hard on life and limb . Twisting hand brakes on the top of moving cars , especially in an icy blizzard at night , was not an easy task , even for experienced trainmen . Dozens of inventors , with hundreds of patents , sought to build a coupler which would close on impact yet open from the side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Confederate veteran just after the war . Major Eli H. Janney ( 1831-1912 ) , while clerking in a dry-goods store near Alexandria , Virginia , used his penknife to whittle out his first model coupler . He patented his device in 1868 , improved it by 1873 , and managed to get the Pennsylvania Railroad interested shortly thereafter . However , few orders came to his Janney Car Coupling Company during the next few years . In the same years , a New Yorker , George Westinghouse ( 1846-1914 ) , was working on the problem of brakes . Westinghouse , getting his idea from French tunnel engineers who were cutting rock with compressed air , patented his air brake in 1869 when he was but twenty-two . The first test of his new invention , made that same year on a short passenger train near Pittsburgh , seemed a dramatic success when a farmer 's wagon that was stalled on the tracks was saved from what seemed to be certain destruction . But railroad men were hard to convince . Commodore Vanderbilt , when importuned by the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that  | you could stop trains with wind ? I 'll give you to understand , young man , that I am too busy to have any time taken up in talking to a damned fool . " Westinghouse persevered , however , improved his device in 1872 by adding a triple valve providing air pressure to each car , and managed to get his invention placed on a few eastern passenger trains . The inventor early saw the need for a standard interchangeable air-brake apparatus . Finding the railroad industry unwilling to provide him with extensive orders , Westinghouse moved on to other things . He became interested in railroad signaling , secured 125 patents in a variety of fields in the eighties , and in 1886 moved into the electrical field by organizing the Westinghouse Electric Company . It was an Iowa farmer who was largely responsible for the final widespread acceptance of the inventions of Janney and Westinghouse . Lorenzo S. Coffin ( 1823 ? 1915 ) , former teacher and chaplain to the 32nd Iowa Infantry during the war , became appalled at the loss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventies . When he discovered that many railroad managers were refusing to use the new couplers and air brakes simply because they were expensive while labor was cheap , he became a fanatic for reform . Rebuffed by rail officials , he traveled widely , spoke frequently , and wrote endlessly ? all for the cause of railroad safety . As railroad commissioner for Iowa ( 1883 ? 88 ) he arranged for air-brake tests by the Burlington Railroad near Burlington , Iowa , in 1886 ? 87 which eventually proved that Westinghouse 's invention was effective , even for long , fast trains going downgrade . Soon Iowa passed state legislation requiring all trains in the state to use automatic couplers and air brakes . About the same time , the Master Car-Builders Association , after some 3,000 patents  | had been issued for coupling devices , adopted a standard model based on Janney 's patents . The coupler worked like the hooked fingers of two hands , essentially being the same coupler used today . Coffin was also instrumental in pushing through to final passage the Railroad Safety Appliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by President Benjamin Harrison ( 1833 ? 1901 ) meant that all trains would be equipped with automatic couplers and air brakes . The improvement in railroad safety was dramatic . The railroad-employee accident rate , which had gone as high as 30,000 in 1881 , was quickly cut 60 per cent . Standardization touched the railroad in other ways in the eighties , when both standard time and uniformity of gauge were adopted during the decade . Standard automatic couplers and air brakes could do little to speed or facilitate through freight traffic as long as a diversity of gauge persisted . In 1861 more than 46 per cent of the nation 's rail mileage was other than the 4 feet 8% inch " standard gauge . " While the use of standard gauge in the building of the Pacific railroads , and such shifts to standard as that completed by the Erie in 1880 , helped bring gauge uniformity , the latter year still found a fifth of the national mileage to be other than standard . Several expedients were used in the sixties and seventies to permit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " compromise car " was the simplest . Having wheels whose tread was five inches wide , the cars could be used on either standard-gauge track or track as wide as 4 feet 10 inches . However , careful railroad operators frowned upon the use of such cars because they claimed that many accidents could be traced to them . A second innovation , the car with wheels that could be made to slide along the axle , was no safer and was  | never widely adopted . Car hoists , or " elevating machines , " with the car lifted to a set of trucks of different gauge , were much safer and were used extensively by such lines as the Erie and the Illinois Central ( for its service south of Cairo ) . A number of lines also went to " double gauge , " the addition of a third rail , permitting the use of equipment of different gauge . There was no substitute for the adoption of a single gauge by the whole nation . In the early eighties most of the gauge divergence was found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Old South , where the five-foot-gauge mileage had actually increased from 7,300 miles during the Civil War to more than 12,000 miles in 1880 . The Chesapeake &; Ohio , the Illinois Central , and the Mobile &; Ohio had all changed to the narrower standard gauge by the middle eighties . James C. Clarke , general manager of the Illinois Central lines south of Cairo , spent weeks of careful preparation for his change of gauge in the spring and early summer of 1881 . On July 29 , 1881 , between dawn and 3:00 P.M. , 3,000 workers shifted the gauge on the entire 550-mile line . The rest of the South soon gave in . Representatives of southern lines totaling more than 13,000 miles agreed early in February , 1886 , to change their gauge the following May 31 and June 1 . During the weeks before the day of the change , part of the southern rolling stock and motive power was changed to the narrower gauge and track gangs moved alternate inside spikes on one rail to the new position . The actual shift was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to match the 4 foot 9 inch gauge of the Pennsylvania , the northern line with which they had the greatest interchange of cars . Using track gangs of from three to five men per mile of track , ten roads west of the mountains shifted their rail on the  | last day of May . The remaining roads shifted June first . On both days the work was accomplished between 3:30 A.M. and 4:00 P.M. , during which period all traffic was stopped . Southern railroads had truly become part of the national network , and passenger or freight cars could move from any southern depot to any part of the nation without change of trucks or bulk . Quietly , in the next decade , all roads with a 4 foot 9 inch gauge shifted half an inch to the official standard gauge required by the American Railway Association . An immediate dividend of increased operating efficiency resulted from gauge standardization as a system of more extensive car interchange developed among the railroad companies . For years railroads had permitted carload freight to be shipped through to the consignee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freight as late as 1890 . The interchange of cars was accelerated as a rental system of " car mileage " ( 0.75 cents per mile for several years ) was introduced . This type of car rental was not very satisfactory because many railways used foreign cars for storage purposes . In 1902 a per diem system of 20 cents per day per car was adopted . Per diem charges were raised several times , being increased to $1.00 per day in 1920 , a rate which was used for many years . Inflation in mid-century brought further increases , and late in 1959 it was raised to $2.88 per day . Early in the century an extensive code of car-service rules was worked out to secure an early return of foreign cars to the home road and to assure an equitable division of the costs of car repair . In the post ? Civil War generation vast improvements were made in the rail . The first steel rail was used in the United  | States in 1863 , when the Pennsylvania imported 150 tons from England . In May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first domestic-made steel rails , but acceptance was slow and the total national production of 2,277 tons in 1867 was enough for only a few miles of line . However , the advantages of the long-wearing new rail were obvious , especially since the price was low . By 1880 the annual production had passed the one-million-ton mark and perhaps a quarter of the nation 's mileage was steel . In 1890 the figure had increased to 80 per cent , and virtually all mileage was laid with steel by 1910 . The rail also became heavier during the years . Much of the steel rail rolled in 1880 weighed but 35 pounds to the yard . By 1920 the average for all railroads in the United States had risen to 82 pounds per yard . And rails also increased in length . The standard rail lengths of 30 feet and 33 feet of the late nineteenth century were pushed up to 39 feet in 1925 . Standard time was adopted during the eighties . As the railroads spanned the nation and became a national network after the Civil War , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of times based upon several mean local sun times . When it was noon in Chicago , it was 11:27 A.M. in Omaha , 11:50 in St. Louis , 12:09 P.M. in Louisville , 12:17 in Toledo , and 12:31 in Pittsburgh . In fact , in Pittsburgh there were six different times for the departure and arrival of trains . The train station in Buffalo had three clocks , each with a different railroad time , while the Chicago Tribune claimed there were 27 local times in Illinois and 38 in Wisconsin . The Union Pacific operated trains on its extensive system with at least six different local sun times . In Kansas City , where the leading jewelers furnished " standard time , " sometimes with a variation  | of as much as twenty minutes , the confusion was untangled only when a single " time ball " was dropped each noon to indicate a uniform time . As early as 1870 the Railroad Gazette had urged the adoption of a single , standard time zone for the entire nation , a proposal which received little support . Professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young ladies ' seminary at Saratoga Springs , New York , was one of the first to suggest that the country be divided into four or more broad time zones or belts . It was William F. Allen ( 1846-1915 ) , managing editor of the Official Guide of the Railways and secretary of the General Time Convention , who finally convinced the lines that they should adopt a standard time . His plans , as conceived by 1881 , were accepted by the railroads in October , 1883 , to go into effect at noon on Sunday , November 18 , 1883 . Zones based on the 75th , 90th , and 105th , and 120th meridians divided the nation into four time belts . As the shift in time took place , people living in the eastern half of each zone experienced the " day of two noons , " while people farther west were thrown abruptly into the future . Public adoption of the new railroad time was general , although one editor did complain that he would rather run his clock on " God 's time ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Attorney General righteously declared that no government department need use the new time until so authorized by Congress . The same gentleman , according to a doubtlessly apocryphal story , was astonished when he missed a late afternoon train on the eighteenth by eight minutes and twenty seconds . Congress officially adopted standard time thirty-five years later , in 1918 . As standardized equipment and uniformity in operation resulted in faster more efficient railroad service , improvements  | in the signaling and control of trains became necessary . A disastrous rear-end collision between two troop trains in New Jersey moved Ashbel Welch ( 1809 ? 82 ) , vice-president and engineer of the Camden and Amboy , to develop in 1865 the first manual block-signal system in America . This idea of keeping trains apart by a certain interval or block of distance was improved upon in 1871 when William Robinson ( 1840 ? 1921 ) devised a closed electric track circuit to set the signals . In the same decade the control of train movements at junctions and terminals was vastly improved when Welch and others introduced manual mechanical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to line up switches and signals in conflict with each other . Pneumatic and electrical interlocking soon followed . The basic principles of block signals , interlocking , and electrical track circuits were to be refined later , in the twenties , into systems of automatic train control ( required on certain lines by the ICC in 1922 ) and centralized traffic control , where a single man at a control desk can manage switches , signals , and train movements over an entire division . Naturally , if there were to be longer and heavier trains in the generations after the Civil War , significant improvements were also required in railroad motive power . Several improvements in locomotives had developed during the Civil War . In 1862 Matthias Baldwin imported five hundred steel tires and began the practice of shrinking them on the iron locomotive wheels . About the same time , successful experiments with steel fireboxes and boilers permitted higher steam pressure and more power . By 1865 the new steam injector was replacing the older boiler pump . In the interest of both beauty and improved performance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position instead of on the diagonal . Changes in fuel were also being made . Exhaustive tests by the Pennsylvania Railroad just before the war indicated that in heating value a ton of soft coal was equal to one and one-third cords of hard wood . In 1862 the Pennsylvania withdrew the last of its wood-burning freight engines , and many other roads soon did likewise . By 1870 both the Pennsylvania and the New York Central were experimenting with track tanks , an arrangement in which a scoop in the tender was lowered to take up water from a pan between the rails while the train was moving at a moderate speed . The major motive-power development after the war was in the size of the locomotive . In New England , where the heavy passenger traffic and moderate freight business permitted it , the railroads clung to the proved American-type engine . There the Taunton , Massachusetts , locomotive works of William Mason ( 1808 ? 83 ) , a cotton-machinery expert who turned to locomotives , produced hundreds of clean-cut engines noted for both their beauty and excellence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4-4-0 ( four wheels in front , four drivers , no wheels under the cab ) according to the Frederic M. Whyte ( 1865 ? 1941 ) system of engine classification . Suburban traffic , and later the elevated lines of New York City and Chicago , also used small locomotives , especially the Forney engine , a tank locomotive invented in 1866 by Matthias N. Forney ( 1835 ? 1908 ) , an inventor who had once been an apprentice to Ross Winans . Most western roads in the late nineteenth century were trying heavier locomotives with more and smaller driving wheels . By the Civil War years the master mechanics and engineers of the Baltimore &; Ohio were shifting from the Ross Winans camel-backs to the  | newer ten-wheelers ( 4-6-0 ) . The " Thatcher Perkins , " built in 1863 and weighing , with tender , nearly 90,000 pounds , was one of the best known ten-wheelers on the B. &O.; By 1865 many lines were also building the Mogul locomotive ( 2-6-0 ) , which provided still greater traction by having 85 per cent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locomotives with long wheelbases in negotiating curves was solved by using flexible-beam driver trucks ( invented in 1842 by Baldwin ) , by providing the journal boxes with lateral play , by removing the flanges from the middle drivers , and by slightly increasing the track gauge on curves . When the Lehigh Valley , a consolidation of a number of short lines , ordered ( in 1867 ) a new type of locomotive with a fourth pair of drivers , still more tractive force was achieved . The new engine , called Consolidation ( 2-8-0 ) in honor of the Lehigh Valley , became the standard heavy freight engine for the next quarter of a century . By 1890 the American and ten-wheeler engines used in passenger service weighed , with tenders , as much as fifty tons . The Consolidations and Decapods ( 2-10-0 ) which provided freight service weighed up to seventy-five or eighty tons . Little additional power could be expected without a larger firebox . This was achieved in the nineties as the firebox was taken from between the rear drivers , made much broader , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service the small Columbia ( 2-4-2 ) appeared in 1892 , the fourhundredth anniversary of the discovery of America . Three years later the Atlantic type ( 4-4-2 ) , an American with a trailing truck , was built for the Atlantic Coast Line . By the turn of the century the Missouri Pacific had ordered the first Pacific ( 4-6-2 ) . Early in the twentieth century Americans  | saw their first articulated , or Mallet , locomotive , an engine with a single boiler and firebox driving two sets of drivers designed by the Frenchman Anatole Mallet ( 1837-1919 ) . The Baltimore &; Ohio ordered a Mallet ( 0-6-6-0 ) in 1904 , and in 1913 the Erie reached a peak in wheel complexity with a triplex Mallet ( 2-8-8-8-2 ) . But such innovations as superheated steam and the automatic stoker were more important to most railroads in the early twentieth century . Freight equipment increased in size and quality along with motive power . As train loads of from one hundred to two hundred tons increased to two thousand tons or more in the half-century after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten tons to about forty tons per car . Some of the first improvement in freight equipment accompanied the introduction of the fast-freight lines . A greater variety of special cars also appeared shortly after the war . Some cattle had been moved by rail before the war , but the major appearance of special stock cars came with the growth of the cattle business in the seventies and eighties . The care of the cattle en route to market was much improved in the early eighties with the addition of feed bins and watering troughs to the cars and the patenting of such new models as the Mather Palace Stock Car by Alonzo Mather ( 1848-1941 ) , a young Chicago businessman who disliked seeing inhumane treatment of livestock . Crude attempts at refrigeration , using ice and sawdust in boxcars , had been tried before the war , but the first patent for a refrigerator car was issued in 1867 , the same year that the Blue Line added such service to its fast freights . The Illinois Central had fast , refrigerated strawberry trains in the seventies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Meat-packers also used the new cars extensively , generally painting their private cars to advertise their product . The first oil shipped by railroad out of the new oil region in Pennsylvania left Titusville in 1865 in two large wooden tubs fastened to a flat car . In 1868 the present type of horizontal tank car fitted with a dome for expansion was introduced . Coal-carrying cars had been used long before the war , but by 1880 hopper cars with all-metal bodies were being built , and the capacity of some coal cars had been increased to fifty tons by the late nineties . The cabin car , or caboose , for the conductor and brakemen also became standard before the war . It gained its distinctive feature , the cupola , during the Civil War when a resourceful conductor on the Chicago and North Western rigged up a seat with a skylight above the roof of his car . While it could hardly be classed as a normal freight movement , the first use of the railroad by a circus came in 1872 when Phineas T. Barnum ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sixty-five flamboyant railway cars to carry his " Museum , Menagerie and Hippodrome " from town to town . In the generation after the Civil War there was a much smaller increase in the size and capacity of passenger equipment than had occurred in freight facilities and motive power . There were definite innovations and improvements in the period , however , both in the variety of cars and in the comfort and safety afforded the passengers . Several railroads had provided sleeping cars in the years before the Civil War , but the service was so crude and uncomfortable in the hard , narrow berths that passengers rarely bothered to undress or remove their boots . In 1864 and 1865 George Pullman decided to improve upon the earlier cars he had built ( before the war )  | for the Chicago and Alton . His " Pioneer , " which cost $20,000 , when no previous car of any type had cost more than $5,000 , was enough larger than existing equipment that it would cause many lines a clearance problem . Finished with hand-carved woodwork , plush carpets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used when Mrs. Lincoln asked if it could be added to the President 's funeral train for the trip from Chicago to Springfield . The Chicago and Alton promptly made the necessary changes in structures , and the " Pioneer " was used for the first time . Soon the " Pioneer " and comparable cars were being used , at premium rates , which the public gladly paid , on the Alton , the Michigan Central , the Burlington , and the Great Western . When Pullman introduced sheets and bed linen as standard equipment , he had some trouble . The request " Please Take Off Your Boots Before Retiring " was placed on placards in every car and printed on every ticket . In 1863 , two daycoaches had been converted into primitive dining cars by the Philadelphia , Wilmington , and Baltimore for service between Baltimore and Philadelphia . Pullman gave dining service the de luxe treatment in 1868 when he built the " Delmonico , " named after the restaurateur . Always an effective publicist , Pullman in 1867 had shown his latest cars to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago . In the late spring of 1870 he outdid himself in providing a 6,000-mile transcontinental round trip " From Faneuil Hall to the Golden Gate " for 129 members of the Boston Board of Trade . The special train consisted of eight " of the most elegant cars ever drawn over an American railway , " all Pullman built of course . In the years that followed , Pullman produced hundreds of sleepers , parlor  | cars , and dining cars in the newly built " company town " of Pullman on the outskirts of Chicago . Pullman operated his cars so efficiently that rival companies , such as those of Edward Knight , T. T. Woodruff , and Webster Wagner , were soon forced to sell out to him . As the Pullman cars grew in elegance and ingenuity , other passenger equipment was improved . Kerosene lamps and , later , the Pintch gaslight from Germany replaced candles in most passenger equipment in the sixties and seventies . In 1882 the Pennsylvania tried lighting a standard passenger car with electricity , and entire trains on a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stoves in some cars in 1868 , and steam heating from the locomotive was introduced by 1881 . Six-wheeled trucks for passenger cars were available by 1876 , and in 1879 the steel-tired wheel was ready to replace the older cast-iron wheel . Steel underframes , center sills , and platforms were available by the end of the century , and in 1906 all-steel passenger coaches were in regular service on the Pennsylvania and the Southern Pacific . Before the use of diners , railroads had tried to prevent their passengers from moving from car to car across the wind-swept , swaying open platforms of moving trains . Since movement between cars now became necessary , great attention was given to increasing passenger safety . The answer to the problem came in 1887 with the introduction of the vestibule ( a flexible , covered passageway between cars ) devised by H. H. Sessions ( 1847-1915 ) , master car-builder and superintendent of the Pullman Company . Solid vestibule trains were soon in service between New York and Chicago on the Pennsylvania Railroad . Full car-width vestibules replaced the original narrow door-width @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the reduction of shock and sway and the reduced chance of the cars ' telescoping in the event of a collision . During the first half-century of its existence , the Pullman Company also built hundreds of private cars for the company presidents and tycoons of the nation , cars that were the last word in elegance , luxury , and refinement . With all the improvements and innovations , railroad travel was still fairly dangerous in the last generation of the nineteenth century . Massachusetts , whose records were perhaps the most complete during the period , reported that her railroads killed ( passengers , employees , and trespassers ) , on the average , 87 people per year in the sixties , 143 per year in the seventies , and 208 per year in the eighties . The accident rate was even worse for the rest of the nation . But Charles Francis Adams , Jr. , did not find the accident rate really excessive , writing in 1879 of the railroad : " A practically irresistible force crashing through the busy hive of modern civilization at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across highways and by-ways . . . can not be expected to work incessantly and yet never come in contact with the human frame . " Come in contact they did , as when a rear-end collision at Revere , Massachusetts , killed 29 and injured 57 in 1871 ; a holocaust at Ashtabula , Ohio , cremated dozens as the crack Pacific Express on Vanderbilt 's Lake Shore &; Michigan Southern crashed through a bridge in 1876 ; and another wreck in 1887 at Chatsworth , Illinois , killed more than 80 . These and other accidents resulted from many things . The Revere tragedy , the ensuing lawsuits of which nearly bankrupted the Eastern Railroad , was clearly the result of a rail management so inept and old-fashioned that in 1871 it was still refusing to use the telegraph for dispatching trains . The  | Ashtabula and Chatsworth disasters , both of which deeply shocked the country , were caused by a combination of kerosene lamps , hot car stoves , and defective bridges . Fire figured in almost every wreck with a long casualty list . Railroad bridges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood and often too lightly built for increasingly heavier traffic . At the time of the Civil War the standard railroad bridge was the Howe truss , a rectangular trussed frame of wooden diagonals and vertical iron tie rods . Invented by William Howe ( 1803 ? 52 ) , farmer turned inventor and uncle of Elias Howe , the new truss was an improvement of an earlier bridge form devised by Colonel Stephen H. Long ( 1784 ? 1864 ) of the Army Engineers . The wreck at Ashtabula was due to the failure of an all-iron Howe truss bridge built in 1863 at the insistence of the road 's president , Amasa Stone ( 1818 ? 83 ) , and against the advice of a subordinate engineer . Stone , brother-inlaw and long-time bridge-building partner of William Howe , was proved wrong thirteen years later . Such accidents as that on Stone 's line hastened a new emphasis on the building of iron and steel railroad bridges with proved margins of safety . The campaign for safer train operation paid off . Railroad passenger safety increased threefold between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by which time there was far less than one fatality for each one hundred million passenger-miles of service . In the last third of the nineteenth century , train robberies , while less frequent and dangerous than wrecks , generally caused equal excitement . The gun in the ribs of the baggage man , the pilfered strongbox in the express car , the tossing of passengers ' watches , cash , and valuables into the renegade 's  | grain sack ? all became a possible hazard of train travel . The activities of the rail desperado also loomed large in the dimenovel literature and folklore of the period . The Reno gang of Indiana was the first well-organized band of train robbers . After successfully holding up several trains on the Mississippi and Ohio Railway and other roads in the late sixties , the activities of the Reno boys were permanently stopped by some indignant vigilantes well supplied with rope . The crimes of two Missouri-born outlaws , Jessie James ( 1847 ? 82 ) and Thomas Younger ( 1844 ? 1916 ) , were a little harder to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an apprenticeship for the life of a desperado as members of the Quantrill band during the Civil War . As the James-Younger gang robbed train after train in Iowa , Missouri , and Kansas in the middle seventies , they were aided by a public opinion that was tolerant , if not sympathetic . Farmers who felt cheated by high freight rates , investors who had lost in wildcat rail investments , railroad workers who remembered the strike violence of 1877 ? all were little worried if other men successfully robbed the cars . Two other bandits , Sam Bass ( 1851 ? 78 ) and Robert Dalton ( 1867 ? 92 ) , both of whom started out as deputy marshals , were cut down in their middle twenties as they preyed upon southwestern trains and banks . There was a decline in rail banditry by the nineties , and after the turn of the century , the steel mail-and-express car , a shift in public opinion , and better police methods combined practically to eliminate the robbing of trains . The dominant characteristic of American railroads in the decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service and operation . The changes in rail , gauge , rolling stock , and motive power all contributed to operational econ- omy . Larger engines with higher tractive effort made for economies in fuel and the use of labor . Better equipment , the increased use of steel rails , and the achievement of a truly integrated network resulted in average higher train speeds , which permitted both cars and engines to cover more mileage per year . The improvements in signaling and train control often made the laying of additional track unnecessary . Larger capacity cars , often without any proportionate increase in dead weight , meant heavier and longer trains . The Illinois Central , for example , increased its average net train load from just under one hundred tons in 1870 to well over five hundred tons in 1915 . These great increases in operational efficiency were responsible for , and accompanied by , significant reductions in freight rates . Average freight rates declined from something over 2 cents a ton-mile at the end of the Civil War to about 0.75 cents a ton-mile by 1900 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad rates certainly fell more rapidly than the general price structure , and as prices tipped upward early in the twentieth century , freight rates generally lagged behind . The relatively cheap rates , plus increasing rail efficiency , gave the railroads a growing monopoly of domestic transportation in the postwar generation . Further increased by the rapid industrialization of a nation whose population was doubling each generation , American railroad freight statistics seemed to explode in the half-century after 1865 . Total freight traffic grew from perhaps 10,000 , - 000,000 ton-miles in 1865 to 79,000,000,000 ton-miles in 1890 and 366,000,000,000 ton-miles in 1916 . Some indication of the increased efficiency of operation can be seen in the fact that slightly more than a fourfold increase in freight cars between  | 1880 and 1920 permitted an increase in freight ton-mileage during the four decades that was nearly elevenfold . In the half-century between the wars the average American relied more and more on the railroads . The per capita annual freight service increased from 285 ton-miles in 1867 to 1,211 in 1890 and 3,588 ton-miles per person in 1916 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late nineteenth century was at the expense of the nation 's rivers , waterways , and canals . The Erie Canal had outlasted all the other man-made waterways but was losing out to rail competition by the end of the Civil War . The fierce railroad rate wars of the seventies proved to be the final blow . By 1876 more than four-fifths of all grain received at eastern ports came by rail . In 1878 the freight receipts at New York City arriving via the New York Central , the Erie , and the Pennsylvania stood at twenty-five million tons , five times the volume of the Erie Canal . Canal barges were generally relegated to such low-grade freight as sand , coal , and cement . The rivers soon followed the canals in declining traffic . The decline of the western river traffic from the lush days of the fifties is most graphically shown by Mark Twain ( 1835 ? 1910 ) in his Life on the Mississippi : Boat used to land ? captain on the hurricane-roof ? mighty stiff and straight ? iron ramrod for a spine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? man on shore takes off hat and says : " Got twenty-eight tons of wheat , cap'n ? be great favor if you can take them . " Captain says : " I 'll take two of them " ? and do n't even condescend to look at him . But nowadays the captain takes off his old slouch , and smiles all the way around to the back of his ears , and gets off a bow which he has n't got any ramrod to interfere with , and says : " Glad to see you , Smith , glad to see you ? you 're looking well  | have n't seen you looking so well for years ? what you got for us ? " " Nuth'n ' , " says Smith ; and keeps his hat on , and just turns his back and goes to talking with somebody else . On the Mississippi in the seventies the passenger business was probably hurt more than the freight traffic . Still , when the " Robert E. Lee " won its famous race with the " Natchez " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1870 , there was not enough freight at the Missouri port to permit the victor immediately to return downstream . The railroads continued to get the bulk of all commercial traffic well into the twentieth century . In 1916 the Interstate Commerce Commission reported that the nation 's steam and electric railways were carrying more than 77 per cent of the intercity freight traffic , and 98 per cent of the intercity passenger business . Most of the non-railroad traffic was on the Great Lakes rather than on rivers and canals . While railroads possessed a full monopoly of the commercial passenger business in the early twentieth century , this portion of the rail traffic had not increased as rapidly as the freight business in the decades since the Civil War . Passenger miles per year had increased from nearly five billion in 1870 to twelve billion in 1890 and thirty-five billion in 1916 . This sevenfold increase in a short half-century was considerably smaller than the freight increase because passenger traffic lacked the elasticity of freight business , especially during the period of rapid American industrial growth . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large fourth of the total rail revenue to roughly a fifth . This decline in the relative importance of passenger revenue was slowed by the fact that passenger fares in the period dropped more slowly than freight rates , being reduced on the average from  | something over three cents a mile in 1865 to two cents a mile in 1916 . Passenger traffic was greatly facilitated in the postwar years as iron and steel bridges were built across major rivers . In 1865 the North Western finished a bridge across the Mississippi ( the second south of St. Paul ) at Clinton , Iowa , and in 1868 the Burlington completed another at Burlington , Iowa . Six years later Captain James B. Eads ( 1820 ? 87 ) completed his bridge at St. Louis . The Missouri River was crossed at Kansas City in 1869 and at Omaha in 1871 . Both Cincinnati and Louisville completed spans across the Ohio in 1870 , and the Illinois Central finally bridged the same stream at Cairo in 1889 . The substitution of bridges for car ferries , such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases in passenger-train speed . American-type locomotives had always been noted for their speed , and it was an engine of that type , New York Central " No. 999 , " which first attained a speed of over 100 miles an hour , running a mile in 32 seconds ( 112.5 miles per hour ) , near Batavia , New York , on May 10 , 1893 . A dozen years later on the Pennsylvania the " Pennsylvania Special , " near Ada , Ohio , ran three miles at the rate of 127 miles per hour . In the same year , 1905 , a rich eccentric from California , " Death Valley Scotty , " paid the Santa Fe $5,500 for a record run of 2,265 miles to Chicago . The special train reached Dearborn Station , Chicago , in 44 hours , 54 minutes , beating the best previous time by more than 13 hours . The desire for more rapid movement of the mails also helped speed up passenger traffic . In the summer of 1862 the first experimental mail car for the sorting of mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph , Missouri , which had been the eastern terminal of the Pony Express . By  | the end of the decade mail clerks were sorting mail on trains in most of the country . In the middle seventies George S. Bangs ( 1825-77 ) , in charge of the Railway Mail Service , suggested to the New York Central that a special , fast , all-mail train be run between New York City and Chicago . The old Commodore rejected the idea , but William H. , with his father 's grudging consent , built a special train of cream-andgold mail cars . The first " Fast Mail " had a twenty-four-hour schedule , fast time for the seventies . As the American rail network expanded and improved its services in the decades after the Civil War , the total rail investment grew rapidly . The total capitalization of the railroads expanded from $2,500,000,000 in 1870 to $10,000,000,000 in 1890 and $21,000,000,000 in 1916 . In the same years , the gross railroad revenue rose from $400,000,000 in 1870 to $1,000,000 , - 000 in 1890 and $3,500,000,000 in 1916 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rail earnings uneven in the generation following the Civil War , but the dividend picture brightened by the end of the nineteenth century . Between 1895 and 1911 the proportion of railroad capital stock which paid dividends increased from 30 per cent to 68 per cent . The rate of return in the latter year was 8 per cent on the dividendyielding stock but only 5.4 per cent on the total capital stock . One aspect of the relative rail prosperity at the turn of the century was the building of a number of elaborate and luxurious stations and union depots . The St. Louis Union Station , built to serve 18 different railroads with its 42 stub tracks , was completed in 1894 , while Boston had its new South Station by 1898 . The beautiful Union Station in Washington , D.C. , was built in 1907 . But the greatest terminals were being built in New York City . The Pennsylvania tunneled under both the  | Hudson and East rivers and opened its Pennsylvania Station in 1910 at a cost of more than $100,000,000 . Three years later the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locomotives served both the new terminals . Some portions of the rail financial picture were not so favorable in the early twentieth century . A fundamental weakness was the growing amount of funded debt carried by the railroads . Until the late eighties capital stock had accounted for a majority of the total rail securities . In the next three decades the rail debt increased so rapidly that by 1916 the public-held , unmatured funded debt stood at $9,900,000,000 , while the public-held capital stock came to only $6,400,000,000 . Another standard of railroad fiscal health , the operating ratio ( the ratio of operating expenditure to operating revenue ) , also showed disturbing symptoms . Nineteenth-century experience had shown that an operating ratio of 65 per cent to 68 per cent indicated a fairly prosperous rail industry . Between 1890 and 1910 the operating ratio had averaged 66.6 per cent , but in the teens , even before federal operation , it had climbed to an average of almost 70 per cent . Higher labor costs contributed to the higher operating ratio . The compensation of labor per rail revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years 1895 ? 99 to 46 cents in the years 1911 ? 15 . In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries American railroad labor improved its position as indicated by the table ( p. 177 ) . Rail employment expanded rapidly in the late nineteenth century and hit an all-time peak of just over two million workers in 1920 as railroads were handed back to private management after two years of federal control . As rail traffic volume increased , railroad employment grew faster than new line was built . The portion of the gainfully employed en- gaged in railroad work increased until one worker in twentyfive was thus employed in the years just prior to World War I. The decline in the number of rail workers after 1920 was the result of the twin forces of an increased efficiency in railroad operation and an ever growing competition from new transport facilities . Increased efficiency in freight service was so marked that in 1916 the average rail worker was producing about two and one-half times as much freight ton-mileage as the worker in 1880 . Between 1916 and 1958 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the railroad worker 's pay increased almost as rapidly as his productivity . His average annual wages rose in the seventies , eighties , and nineties , while price levels were stable or declining . In the first years of the new century his pay increases in general were as large as the increases in the cost of living . Throughout the period the railroad employee had wages well above the earnings of the average American , whose mean annual pay was $438 in 1890 , $438 in 1900 , $574 in 1910 , and $708 in 1916 . He was also better off than the rail workers of Europe . In 1907 , when the average yearly rail wages amounted to  | $661 in the United States , they were $371 in Germany , $292 in Switzerland , and $260 in the United Kingdom . Among American railroad men the operating personnel were the best paid . Engineers received average daily wages of $3.68 in 1892 and $4.46 in 1908 ( about twice the average daily wage for the industry ) . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; firemen , $2.07 and $2.76 ; and brakemen , $1.89 and $2.64 . Undoubtedly the early unionization of railroad workers contributed to their fairly high wage scales . Following the lead of the operating brotherhoods , who founded their four unions in the two decades after the Civil War , twenty different railroad labor organizations were in existence by 1901 . The half-century following the Civil War had been a period of advancement , not only for railroad labor , but for all facets and aspects of the industry . The rapid expansion of the national rail network in the last decades of the nineteenth century was fully matched by the technological improvements adopted by the rail carriers . The increased use of fast-freight lines and the successful experiments with air brakes and improved couplers clearly showed the American businessman that an integrated national rail network was soon to be available . The adoption of steel rail , the building of key bridges across major streams , and significant improvements in signaling resulted in faster freight service . Standard time and standard gauge , both achieved during the eighties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Throughout the period average train loads went up , and freight rates declined , as locomotives of greater power and rolling stock of greater capacity were added to equipment rosters . Most observers of the national transportation scene  | in the early twentieth century were agreed that American railroads were providing a shipping and traveling public with an efficient and extensive service . In the five decades before World War I the railroads of the country had expanded and developed more rapidly than most segments of the industrial economy . While the population had not quite tripled ( 36,000,000 to 102,000,000 ) between 1865 and 1916 , the nation 's rail network had grown more than sevenfold in the same years . In the half-century the annual value of manufactured products in America increased nearly seventeen times , from perhaps $3,000,000,000 to about $50 , - 000,000,000 . Annual rail freight ton-mileage increased by thirty-five times in the same years . While the total national income was experiencing a sevenfold increase and the national wealth was growing ten times , annual gross railroad revenue had a twelvefold increase , from $300,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking care of the nation 's transportation needs , even though those needs were growing with explosive speed . In the years between the two wars the American economy had developed from an agrarianoriented second-rate industrial society into the industrial giant of the world . The nation 's railroads had kept pace with the change . As the American network of steel rails was completed in the first years of the new century , the dominance of the railroad in the carriage of both freight and passengers seemed complete . These years of completion and expansion saw the passing of the last of the great railroad-builders . Collis P. Huntington , thrifty , hard-working Connecticut Yankee to the end , died in 1900 , leaving behind him the plain , cramped little office ( on the seventh floor of the Mills Building in New York  | City ) in which he had worked . Harriman died in 1909 , and the elder Morgan passed on four years later . The " Empire Builder , " James Jerome Hill , died in 1916 ( the year of peak rail mileage and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades ) . The last of the nineteenthcentury railroad-builders were gone . Their successors were to face new problems .  | Twice in the twentieth century American railroads faced the rigors of total war . Twice the railroads helped the nation to victory . Half a century earlier , before they had completed the bulk of their rail network , the railroads had played a vital role in a conflict fought at home , the Civil War . In 1917 , only a few months after the lines had been built to a record peak of mileage , the railroads were called upon to meet the unprecedented transportation demands of a domestic economy preparing for total conflict . They were also expected to help supply the Allies in Europe , who seemed to have an insatiable appetite for more and more war materiel . Some of the transport lessons learned in a simpler war fifty years before had been forgotten , but the transportation crisis at Christmas time , 1917 , was mainly the result of other factors : the very dependence of the nation on rail transport , the unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developments in recent years . Faced with crisis , the United States Railroad  | Administration took over the lines , operated them as a single system , and met the basic transportation requirements . Twenty years later , when war again came to America , the railroads remembered the unpalatable years of federal operation and resolved to do their job by themselves . Even though weakened by the depression of the thirties , the rail lines , recalling lessons learned earlier , went on to meet the tremendous transportation rquirements of World War II without the benefit of any substantial direction by the government . In the five decades after the Civil War , American railroads had made great advances in mileage , uniformity , and the general efficiency of their operation . Nevertheless , they were experiencing one of the most difficult financial periods in their history in the years just before America became involved in World War I. A major cause of the financial troubles in the teens was the steady rise in the costs of railroad operation , without any corresponding increase in railroad rates and earnings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country went up about 30 per cent . Rail costs for fuel , taxes , and labor increased at an even higher rate . Average railroad wages increased 50 per cent in the period . Railroad taxes tripled in amount , while gross earnings only doubled in the fifteen years . Throughout the decade and a half , freight rates remained virtually unchanged at 0.73 cents a ton-mile . The Hepburn Act of 1906 , in giving the ICC the authority to establish reasonable maximum rates , had transferred the burden of proof to the railroads in future rate cases . Railroad management , which had been building up public ill will for decades , received little sympathy from either the public or the ICC as it struggled against the rising costs of operation in the early twentieth century . Requests for higher rates in 1910  | were unanimously rejected by the Commission . A second request in 1913 eventually resulted in a modest 5 per cent advance in freight rates , but the relief was inadequate and was soon nullified by further hikes in operating costs . As rail traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 72 per cent and the financial condition of several weaker systems became desperate . Soon the Rock Island , the Frisco , the Wabash , and the New Haven systems were faced with bankruptcy . By early fall of 1915 , a sixth of the rail network of the nation , more than 40,000 miles of road with a capitalization of $2,250,000,000 , was under court control or awaiting receivership . In the teens the declining credit position of the industry made it difficult for the railroads to continue planned improvements in their facilities . Railroad traffic definitely increased in 1915 and 1916 , but the returning prosperity was accompanied by new demands from labor . In 1916 the four operating brotherhoods ( engineers , firemen , conductors , and trainmen ) , already the best paid of railroad labor , demanded an eight-hour day instead of the ten-hour day then in effect . Since the hours of train service could not easily be shortened , the demand was really a request for a major pay boost . When negotiations faltered , President Woodrow Wilson ( 1856 ? 1924 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overtime pay . The compromise was unacceptable to the railroad presidents , some of whom may have welcomed the prospect of a general strike as a way of breaking the unions . When the rail executives rejected the President 's final plea at a White House conference on August 21 , Wilson left the room , exclaiming bitterly : " I pray God to forgive you , I never can . "  | The brotherhoods called a nationwide strike for September 4 , 1916 . Fearing a national crisis , Wilson urged Congress on August 29 to pass legislation providing for the eight-hour day . Congress quickly responded with the Adamson Act , sponsored by William C. Adamson ( 1854-1929 ) , chairman of the House Interstate Commerce Committee and long-time friend of railroad labor . The law gave the brotherhoods the eighthour day , effective January 1 , 1917 . The railroad companies refused to obey the legislation , which they contended was unconstitutional , and sought satisfaction in the federal courts . Unwilling to wait for a judicial decision , union leaders called a strike for March 19 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managers decided to yield , and that afternoon the Supreme Court , in a five to four decision , upheld the eighthour law . The labor leaders had picked the best possible time to do battle for their shorter work day : rail revenues were high with a glut of defense traffic , skilled labor was hard to keep because of the high wages paid in defense plants , and the nation was on the verge of war . Two days after the decision of the Supreme Court , President Wilson issued a call for the special session of Congress that was to hear his war message . Many problems faced the nation 's rail lines as America entered World War I in April , 1917 . There was no shortage of rail traffic . As a Europe at war sought more and more American foodstuffs and military supplies , railroad ton-mileage increased so rapidly that freight traffic in 1917 was 43 per cent greater than that of 1914-15 . As operating costs , especially those of labor , continued to rise , the railroads appealed to the ICC for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with token increases . By the end of the year operating costs  | were such that the full requested rate increase , even if granted , would have been inadequate . Efficient railroad operation was also difficult during the war because the bulk of all freight shipments was headed in one direction : toward a few eastern seaports . The successful German submarine campaign of 1917 reduced the shipping tonnage available in these ports , and ports and rail terminals alike became glutted with goods waiting for cargo space to Europe . In this crisis America forgot a basic lesson in war transportation which had been learned in the Civil War . Back in 1864 , in his Atlanta campaign , General Sherman had insisted that the 160 freight cars that arrived daily had to be unloaded at once and returned north for another load . In 1917 far too many cars were being used for storage purposes . In the fall of 1917 , when the national shortage of freight cars was reported at 158,000 , some 180,000 loaded cars were piled up at or near eastern ports with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge of war . Immediately after war was declared , Daniel Willard ( 1861-1942 ) , president of the Baltimore &; Ohio Railroad and chairman and transportation expert of the Advisory Commission of the Council of National Defense , asked the nation 's top rail executives to assemble in Washington , D.C. There , on April 11 , 1917 , nearly seven hundred railroad presidents signed a resolution in which they agreed to contribute to the war effort by running their several lines as though they constituted " a continental railway system . " To co-ordinate their efforts the railroads created a five-man Railroads ' War Board with the scholarly president of the Southern Railway , Fairfax Harrison ( 1869-1938 ) , as chairman . Under Harrison 's aggressive  | direction the group organized car pools to relieve the car shortage , urged heavier loading of freight cars , and encouraged economy in operation by suggesting the elimination of duplicate passenger trains . Railroad executives found it difficult to operate their collective lines as a " continental " system , since any real unification was legally impossible under the Antitrust Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep and use any strategic traffic advantage it might possess . Throughout 1917 the morale of many rail employees was not high , and most lines were plagued by a constant labor turnover caused by the drafting of many railroad men and the fact that other employees were attracted by the high wages available in war plants . Shortages of labor , equipment , and capital , plus the early arrival of winter weather , brought the railroads into a fresh crisis by November , 1917 . On November 1 the car shortage stood at 158,000 cars and was increasing daily . In a special report to Congress on December 1 , the Interstate Commerce Commission recommended that President Wilson assume control of and operate the nation 's railroads . As a merely advisory body , the Railroads ' War Board had been proven incapable of solving an almost impossible problem . The government had entered the war transportation picture months before it took possession of the railroads in December , 1917 . A portion of the Army Appropriation Act of August 29 , 1916 , known as the Federal Possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take possession of any system of transportation in wartime , should the emergency require such action . Several weeks after the declaration of war the Esch Car Service Act of May 29 , 1917 , gave the Interstate Commerce Commission full authority to establish rules covering  | the movement , distribution , exchange , and return of all railroad cars . The Commission was slow to exercise any real authority under this act . Early in the war , under the authority of the Federal Possession and Control Act , officials of the United States Shipping Board , the Army , and the Navy all began to issue priority orders for rail shipments . Soon thousands of government officials throughout the nation were using bundles of preference tags . When placed on a freight car , the tag gave the car the right of way over untagged shipments . The tags were issued and used indiscriminately , and soon the bulk of all freight seemed to be moving under priority orders . Late in 1917 the Pennsylvania Railroad estimated that 85 per cent of the freight on its Pittsburgh division was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials for the Hog Island shipyard were rushed to the area under priority order weeks before any unloading facilities were available . The government endeavored to bring some order to the priority confusion with the passage of a Priority Law on August 10 , 1917 . Robert S. Lovett ( 1860-1932 ) , chairman of the executive committee of the Union Pacific Railroad , was appointed Director of Priority by President Wilson . Lovett apparently felt that he had no authority to cancel existing orders , but at least he issued very few additional ones . By Christmas , 1917 , the time for further government action had clearly come . As an early and unusually severe winter set in , the resulting drop in rail efficiency was shown by the decline in average daily freight car mileage from twenty-six miles in November to twenty-one miles in December . Following the recommendation of the Interstate Commerce Commission and acting under the authority of the Federal Posses- sion and Control Act , President Wilson , on December 26 , 1917 , issued a proclamation providing for the government operation of the railroads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the accompanying statement , the President pointed out that the financial needs of the railroads and of the government could be satisfactorily met only if they were under a common direction . He also claimed that the full mobilization of the nation 's economic resources required that a single authority run the railroads of the country . In his message to Congress on the subject on January 4 , 1918 , he paid tribute to the patriotic zeal and ability of the nation 's rail executives and said : " If I have taken the task out of their hands , it has not been because of any dereliction or failure on their part , but only because there were some things which the Government can do and private management can not . " Wilson promised full protection of the property rights of railroad owners , but it was upon his recommendation that Congress passed the Railroad Control Act on March 21 , 1918 , which provided that the annual compensation to the several lines should be no more than the average net operating income for the three years ending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have preferred a rental based upon the last year before the nation went to war , since the threeyear base period included the very lean earnings of 1915 . The legislation of March , 1918 , also provided for maintenance , repairs , and renewals by the government , with the property to be returned " in substantially as good repair and in substantially as complete equipment as it was at the beginning of the Federal control . " The expenses of federal control and operation were to be met with a revolving fund of $500,000 , - 000 created for that purpose . The law also provided that the  | lines were to be returned to their owners within twenty-one months following the ratification of the treaty of peace . In his proclamation of December 26 , Wilson appointed William G. McAdoo ( 1863 ? 1941 ) Director General of Railroads . Already Secretary of the Treasury , McAdoo was chosen by Wilson because of this position , since the control of the railroads was a matter of finance as well as actual operation . As a young lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become interested in completing railroad tunnels under the Hudson River . The financial and engineering success of the venture was matched by McAdoo 's skill in public relations when in 1909 he coined the phrase " The Public Be Pleased " for his concern , the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad Company . McAdoo brought to his new position a general knowledge of railroads , years of financial experience , and proved administrative ability . As a general rule , the new Director General allowed the operating organizations of the individual roads to remain intact . Some of the railroad presidents kept their positions , but many were replaced during the course of the war by federal managers . Final control of the roads , of course , lay in Washington , where McAdoo set up a central administrative system which was intended to weld the many lines of the country into a single great system . McAdoo naturally staffed his organization with railroad men . Walker D. Hines ( 1870 ? 1934 ) , chairman of the board of the Atchison , Topeka and Santa Fe , was appointed Assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroads of the nation into three regions : the Eastern ( east of Chicago and the Mississippi and north of the Ohio and Potomac rivers ) , the Western ( west of Chicago and the Mississippi River ) , and the Southern ( east of the Mis- sissippi and south of the Ohio and Potomac rivers ) . To be regional director of the Eastern Region , where the worst rail congestion was located , McAdoo appointed his friend , Alfred H. Smith ( 1863-1924 ) , president of the New York Central . McAdoo and the Railroad Administration soon made a number of changes in rail operations in the interests of efficiency and a more co-ordinated service . In an effort to discourage unnecessary civilian travel , duplicate passenger-train service was eliminated , sleeping-car service was curtailed , and limited trains were obliged to handle local traffic . Trains with very few passengers were discontinued entirely . The curtailment of competing duplicate passenger service in such overserved middle western cities as Chicago , St. Louis , and St. Paul was quite justified . The annual savings in passenger traffic for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 67,000,000 passenger-train miles . Despite this reduction in service , the railroads had 8 per cent more passenger traffic in 1918 than in 1917 . The consolidation of timetables and ticket offices was also a useful economy . Savings in both passenger and freight service were made as the joint use of terminals , repair shops , and other equipment was initiated . Stringent controls were introduced for railroad freight . The centralized management of the routing and distribution of traffic reduced the congestion on crowded lines and resulted in a greater use of routes that had been operating well below their full capacity . An effort was made to control the freight at the source , and terminal managers at all important points endeavored to have shipments accepted only when reports indicated that prompt delivery at the destination was possible . McAdoo vigorously applied the principle that freight should , if possible , always be sent by the shortest route . Savings were  | made as the Railroad Administration introduced standardization in repair work and a greater uniformity in new equipment . McAdoo ordered 100,000 new freight cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The new equipment , costing $380,000,000 and ultimately charged to the railroads , used up a major portion of the revolving fund provided by Congress . But serious freight-car shortages were a thing of the past by the late spring of 1918 . The total freight moved in 1918 ( 440,000,000,000 ton-miles ) was only 2 per cent greater than that moved under private management in 1917 ( 430,000,000,000 ton-miles ) , but the sense of crisis and confusion was notably less . One of the first major problems facing McAdoo was that of railroad labor . ' Well aware of increased living costs and wellpaying war-industry jobs , many rail workers were restive in 1917 . On December 1 , 1917 , two of the operating brotherhoods made wage demands calling for nearly a 40 per cent increase in pay , and the remaining brotherhoods were considering comparable requests . Urged on by Alfred H. Smith , a man who knew , by experience , railroad work from track hand to the top executive post of the New York Central , McAdoo decided to raise wages . On January 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigate wages and working conditions , with any recommended wage increases to be retroactive to January 1 , 1918 . The Wage Commission , which made its report on April 30 , found , among other things , that the cost of living had gone up 40 per cent between December , 1915 , and December , 1917 , and that 51 per cent of all rail employees in December , 1917 , were making $75 per month or less . In recommending wage increases , the Commission decided to apply them to wage rates  | as they stood in December , 1915 , and to grant increases on a sliding scale which favored the lower-paid workers . Employees making up to $85 per month received at least a 40 per cent boost , the $100-a-month man went up 31 per cent , the $150 wage climbed 16 per cent , and a monthly wage of $250 received no increase at all . The great bulk of the 1,800,000 workers received substantial increases , but many of the higherpaid workers were unhappy because the new rates did violence to long-established wage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose from $1,782,000,000 in 1917 to $2,665,000,000 in 1918 . During 1918 the Railroad Administration standardized wages throughout the country and adopted the eight-hour day as normal for all types of railroad work . Wage increases were also made after the war , and the annual average compensation per employee rose from $1,003 in 1917 to $1,419 in 1918 ; $1,485 in 1919 ; and $1,820 in 1920 , the year the owners regained their lines . The portion of the railroad revenue dollar going to labor rose from 40 cents in 1917 to 55 cents in 1920 . Naturally , railroad executives were bitter about the high labor costs they inherited from the years of government control . Their bitterness seems rather reasonable when one recalls that the average railroad worker 's annual compensation of roughly $1,000 in 1917 was 27 per cent above the average for workers engaged in manufacturing that year . Average railroad wages in 1920 were 33 per cent above those in manufacturing . Railroad expenses other than labor also rose rapidly during the war years . The total cost of coal and locomotive fuel nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement in the period increased only 11 per cent . As a result of the heavy increases in operating expenses , McAdoo ,  | in May , 1918 , announced an average 28 per cent increase in freight rates and an 18 per cent increase in passenger fares , effective June 25 , 1918 . Since the boost in rates ( unlike the wage increases ) could not be retroactive , the increases in operating costs during 1918 were substantially higher than the increases in total revenue . The situation was not improved in the post-Armistice period of government operation . The railroad operating ratio , which had been an excellent 65.5 per cent in 1916 and an acceptable 70.4 per cent in 1917 , ran to 81.5 per cent in 1918 ; 85.5 per cent in 1919 ; and 94.3 per cent in 1920 . While from the standpoint of operating results government management was satisfactory , it was clearly otherwise from a financial point of view . Shortly after the Armistice , McAdoo resigned from his many government posts and retired to private life , giving as one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of government service . Wishing to help the man who had done so much for them , the railroad workers of the country started a campaign to have each worker contribute a dollar a year to keep McAdoo at the head of the Railroad Administration . McAdoo declined with thanks and left the government . His successor as Director General was his second in command , Walker D. Hines . Mr. Hines had the thankless task of running the lines after the war crisis was over . Faced with an unprecedented decline in rail traffic and with record expenses , he decided to save the national economy from the burden of higher rates , which the rail industry clearly deserved . Naturally , the deficits grew and grew . As admitted by Hines in April , 1920 , the excess of total operating expenses and rentals ( paid to the several railroads ) over total revenues for the twenty-six months ( January 1 , 1918 ? March 1 , 1920 )  | of federal control amounted to just over $900,000,000 . This figure does not include the $204,000,000 paid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control . Government management of the nation 's railroads had been a costly venture . The financial results of federal wartime operation of the nation 's railroads are certainly not conclusive proof of the success or failure of government in business . The railroads were not taken over in 1917 for the purpose of making money . Granting that the necessity for federal operation was partially the result of governmental mistakes in both regulation and the issuance of priorities , the transportation crisis as of Christmas , 1917 , still called for the action taken by Wilson . Both war freight and troops had to be moved , and the Railroad Administration made a significant contribution to the successful prosecution of the war and the final victory which followed . With victory complete , the President , in his annual message to Congress in December , 1918 , urged that body to give speedy consideration to the railroad problem . The retiring Director General , Mr. McAdoo , advised that Congress provide for five years of additional federal control . Still more extreme was the Plumb Plan , named for Glenn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four big railroad brotherhoods . Plumb urged that the government buy the railroads and entrust their direction to a fifteen-man board representing equally the government , railroad labor , and the operating officials . Railroad workers , the American Federation of Labor , and other labor groups all endorsed the Plumb Plan , but it received scant consideration from the general public , which wanted to see an early return to private management and direction . Congress wrestled with the railroad problem  | from the summer of 1919 well into the following winter . It completed its work late in February , 1920 , just a few days before the railroads were returned to private control on March 1 . The Esch-Cummins Act , or Transportation Act of 1920 , in providing for the return of the railroads to private management , greatly increased the power and scope of the original Interstate Commerce Act . Not only was the Interstate Commerce Commission increased in size from nine to eleven members , it was also given many new powers and functions . In its supervision of railroad rates the Commission could establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratemaking it was to fix them at a level which would assure a fair rate of return ( originally set at 5.5 per cent ) on the railroad investment . One-half of any excess income beyond 6 per cent was subject to recovery by the government . But the immediate concern was to get the railroads operating in the black , and for the first six months of private operation ( March 1 , 1920 , to September 1 , 1920 ) the Transportation Act guaranteed the individual lines a net railway operating income equal to half the annual rental paid during the period of federal control . This six-month guaranty cost the federal treasury $530,000,000 . Higher railroad rates , long overdue , went into effect at the end of the six-month period . The freight-rate increase ranged from 25 per cent in the South and West to 40 per cent in the East . Among other new powers granted the Commission was the supervision of all railroad-security issues and the requirement that mergers or railroad consolidations be subject to Commission approval . A marked change from earlier attitudes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed the Commission to take steps looking toward the consolidation of the country 's railroads into a limited number of systems . To comply with the law , the Commission employed Professor William Z. Ripley ( 1867 ? 1941 ) of Harvard University , author of many standard works on railways , to formulate a complete consolidation plan for the nation . Professor Ripley suggested nineteen great systems , one of which was the merger of the Burlington with the Northern Pacific , a combination expressly denied by the Supreme Court seventeen years earlier in the Northern Securities case . The consolidation plans obviously were not compulsory , and no significant mergers based upon them took place in the generation following the passage of the Transportation Act in 1920 . The ICC was also granted extensive new powers over the construction and abandonment of railroad mileage . The legislation of 1920 created the nine-man Railroad Labor Board , three members representing the railroads , three the employees , and three the general public . The new board was given extensive jurisdiction over railroad labor disputes concerning grievances , rules , working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force of public opinion could be relied upon to enforce the decision of the new agency . The end of the war found railroad labor again restless , several unauthorized strikes having plagued the last weeks of government control under Director General Hines . The Railroad Labor Board entered the disputes in the spring of 1920 and on July 30 , 1920 , ordered a general advance averaging 22 per cent in wages for all classes of railroad labor , effective May 1 , 1920 . The annual cost of the increase was estimated at more than $600,000,000 . Railroad managers were not happy with the general situa- tion as they resumed private direction of the roads in 1920 . Railroad workers seemed disgruntled even though their wages had just been raised , general operating costs were high , and the year 's operating ratio was a record high of 94 per cent . Strangely , the business downturn in 1921 did not cause the situation to deteriorate further . Operating revenues declined more than 10 per cent between 1920 and 1921 , but operating expenses were reduced even more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during 1921 , and wage reductions averaging about 12 per cent became effective July 1 , 1921 . As a result , the operating ratio declined to 82 per cent in 1921 and averaged below 75 per cent for the rest of the decade . The return of relative railroad prosperity in the twenties did not make railroad management complacent about its recent experience with government operation . The troublesome strike of railway shopmen in the summer of 1922 , serious freight-car shortages in the same year , and operating problems caused by the unusually severe winter of 1922 ? 23 helped convince railway executives that they should embark upon a program of increasing operating efficiency . Even earlier in 1920 , one result of the wartime experience had been the creation of the Car Service Division by a predecessor of the Association of American Railroads . The railroads collectively conferred upon the new agency the power to marshall and direct railroad cars to meet any emergency . Another step in co-operation and increased efficiency came in 1923 with the creation in Minneapolis of the Northwest Shippers Advisory Board , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make railroad transport more productive . Within a few years the nation was served by thirteen such regional boards . Each  | board normally met four times a year in an effort to estimate the potential needs for railroad cars and service for the next three months . Both the efficient use of rail equipment and the avoidance of car shortages were greatly aided by the activities of the Car Service Division and the Shippers Regional Advisory Boards . Rail executives wanted even more direct action as they sought an improvement in operating efficiency . In April , 1923 , many of them met in New York City and adopted a comprehensive program of railroad improvement and increased efficiency . In a multipronged approach to their problem they agreed to : ( 1 ) increase materially their capital expenditures for additional motive power , rolling stock , and trackage facilities ; ( 2 ) reduce the percentage of " bad order " equipment awaiting repair ; ( 3 ) plan an earlier seasonal movement of coal ; ( 4 ) plan maintenance and construction work as early in the year as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unloading of cars by shippers ; ( 6 ) better their utilization of existing cars by increasing average car loading to thirty tons and average daily car movement to thirty miles ; and ( 7 ) avoid car shortages through increased co-operation between railroads and with the Car Service Division . Between 1923 and 1930 the railroads spent $6,741,000,000 in a capital improvement program which included $765,000 , - 000 for new motive power , $1,760,000,000 for freight cars , $398,000,000 for passenger equipment , and $1,360,000,000 for new and improved track and roadway . As a result of these heavy purchases , more than a quarter of their locomotives and nearly 40 per cent of their freight cars were less than eight years old as of 1930 . The depression thirties greatly slowed these capital expenditures , but the drive for operating effi- ciency continued throughout the decade . The increases in operating efficiency achieved between 1921 and 1940 can be seen in the table below . The substantial increases in operating efficiency achieved between World War I and World War II were augmented by improvements in track and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-time high of 254,000 miles of main line had been reached , there had been 143,000 miles of other track , sidings , and yard track , or an average of 56 miles of additional track for each 100 miles of main line . While the main-line mileage slowly declined in the twenties , the mileage of additional trackage increased . By 1930 there was an average of 72 miles of additional track for each 100 miles of main line . By 1941 the miles of main line had dropped to 231,971 , but  | the total trackage was 403,625 miles , or an average of 74 miles of additional trackage for each 100 miles of main track . The weight of the rail had also been increased during the years of peace from an average weight of 83 pounds per yard in 1921 , to 96 pounds per yard in 1941 . In the latter year well over 40 per cent of all main-line rail weighed more than 100 pounds to the yard . Comparable advances came in signaling during the interwar years . In 1921 only 39,000 miles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were equipped with automatic block signals . Twenty years later this had increased to 66,000 miles , or 28 per cent of the main-track mileage . Even more important was the start made in the late twenties and thirties in Centralized Traffic Control . Centralized Traffic Control is the operation of trains over a division , or a portion thereof , in which a single operator-dispatcher at a control and indicating machine sets switches and trackside signals for the movement of all trains . Since the dispatcher can arrange for the meeting of trains in the most efficient way , savings in time are great . There were 36 installations of Centralized Traffic Control on 341 miles of line in the country in 1929 . This had grown by 1941 to 229 installations serving 2,163 miles of road . The reduction of congestion on heavily used lines with the new type of control soon proved phenomenal . During the war years Centralized Traffic Control was added to much southern and western single track mileage . By 1945 , when the trackage thus controlled had tripled to 6,495 miles in 328 installations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the successful railroad war effort . The effect of World War II on the nation 's railroads was felt long before Pearl Harbor . The national-defense program  | and the requirements of the Lend-Lease Act brought a return of prosperity to the railroads after the long years of depression . The year 1940 found the railroads of the country with higher total operating revenues than for any year since 1930 and with an operating ratio ( 72 per cent ) that was lower than for any year since 1929 . Business was even better the following year , when operating revenues climbed 25 per cent . In 1941 freight ton-mileage reached 475,000,000,000 , a figure 17 per cent higher than the 1918 World War I peak and 6 per cent above the previous all-time-record year of 1929 . The operating ratio dropped to 69 per cent , the lowest since 1916 , and the rate of return on the net property investment rose to 4.28 per cent , the highest since 1929 . After years of red ink , receivership , and low income , the new rail prosperity was most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second time in a generation , the nation 's railroads made every effort to escape the government control they had endured from 1917 to 1920 . But World War I had quite clearly shown the need for at least some form of centralized direction over the transportation of a nation at war . President Franklin D. Roosevelt ( 1882 ? 1945 ) took the first step toward a co-ordination of wartime transport in May , 1940 , when he appointed Ralph Budd ( 1879 ? ) Transportation Commissioner of the Advisory Commission to the Council of National Defense . Mr. Budd , who as president of the Burlington Railroad had revitalized passenger traffic on his line in 1934 with the streamlined Diesel " Zephyr , " was concerned with truck , bus , air , and pipeline transportation as well as railroads . In January , 1941 , his duties were shifted to a new agency as he was appointed Director of the Transportation Division in the Office of Emergency Management .  | Though he had no mandatory powers , Budd endeavored , through co-operation and consultation with the railroads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid the troubles that had plagued transport in World War I. After Pearl Harbor a more comprehensive supervision of transportation seemed to be needed , and on December 18 , 1941 , Roosevelt set up the Office of Defense Transportation ( ODT ) , appointing Joseph B. Eastman ( 1882-1944 ) , veteran member of the ICC and Federal Co-ordinator of Transportation from 1933 to 1936 , Director . The ODT was responsible for coordinating all transportation facilities , estimating war traffic requirements , and directing domestic war traffic through cooperation with ocean shipping so that port congestion could be avoided . In short , the ODT , through full co-ordination and co-operation with the total transport facilities of the nation , was trying to avoid the mistakes and confusion that had occurred in 1917 and 1918 . The railroad industry was most anxious to substitute co-operation for compulsion . Individual railroads , the Association of American Railroads , along with its Car Service Division , and the Shippers Advisory Boards all co-operated in the fullest possible way . As a result , the government did not find it necessary in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a very brief period of labor difficulty in December , 1943 , and January , 1944 . Complete co-operation among the railroads was essential as they faced the demands of war in December , 1941 . The depression thirties plus the competition of rival transport agencies since World War I had forced a substantial decline in railroad facilities . As compared to the end of 1916 , American railroads at the end of 1941 had 25 per cent fewer freight cars , 30 per cent fewer passenger cars , and 32 per cent fewer  | locomotives . The number of rail employees in 1941 was down nearly a third from 1916 . However , average freight-car capacity and average locomotive tractive effort had grown significantly in the quarter-century . Thus the 1,703,000 freight cars in 1941 had a total carrying capacity ( 85,682,000 tons ) only 7 per cent below those of 1916 , and the 41,771 locomotives actually had an aggregate tractive effort slightly above that available in the earlier year . With a total carrying capacity certainly no larger than that of World War I , the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of much greater volume . The total tonmileage of freight carried in each of the four war years ( 1942 through 1945 ) was more than 50 per cent greater than in 1918 , and in the peak year , 1944 , the 737,000,000,000 ton-miles was 82 per cent above the top year of the earlier war . Passenger traffic also quickly jumped . Total passenger-mileage in 1942 was a quarter larger than that of 1918 , and each of the years 1943 , 1944 , and 1945 saw a passenger traffic that more than doubled the 1918 figure . When one remembers the low base of depression rail operations , the increase was even greater . Rail freight in 1944 more than tripled the figures for 1932 , the low year of the depression , and passenger traffic climbed almost sixfold in the same years . Between Pearl Harbor and V-J Day , American railroads furnished 97 per cent of all domestic troop movements and about 90 per cent of all domestic movements of Army and Navy equipment and supplies . In the forty-five months of war , 113,891 special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or an average of nearly a million men a month . This was more than twice the average monthly troop movement in World War I. Because of shortages of rubber  | and gasoline and because German submarines drove coastal tankers from the open sea , most of the increased wartime traffic was carried by rail . Between 1941 and 1944 the railroads handled 77 per cent of the new intercity passenger traffic and 83 per cent of the new commercial freight business . The boom in new traffic was most noticeable in the movement of oil to the eastern seaboard . In the summer of 1941 rail deliveries of oil to the East amounted to only 11,250 barrels daily , but as German submarines pinched off coastal tankers , rail deliveries to the East rose to more than 1,000,000 barrels a day . The flood of new rail business was taken care of chiefly with equipment in use at the time of Pearl Harbor . During the war years the War Production Board was so stingy with material allocations to the railroads that passenger cars were increased in number by only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 3 per cent , and the number of locomotives grew only 4 per cent . The successful record of American railroads during World War II was made possible chiefly by the tremendous increase in operating efficiency achieved in the two decades between the two world conflicts . This new efficiency was so marked that whereas daily average shortages of freight equipment had been 113,000 cars in 1917 and 52,000 cars in 1918 , in World War II they dropped to a daily average of only 10,000 cars in the worst year , 1945 . The record achieved by the railroads was also made possible by differences in the nature of the traffic in the two wars . In World War I , a one-front war , most traffic went to eastern ports , subsequently requiring a large amount of empty-car mileage westward . A more efficient use of equipment was possible in the two-front Second World War , since there were large shipments headed west as well as east .  | This heavy traffic across the vast distances of the mountain West clearly contributed to a second transport difference in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haul , both for freight and passengers , was much greater than in World War I. In 1918 the average freight haul was 321 miles , while in 1944 it was half again as large , or 494 miles . The total of originated revenue freight in 1944 was 1,491,000,000 tons , or only 18 per cent larger than the 1,263,000,000 tons originated in 1918 . Since the cars were smaller in the first war the 44,592,000 cars of revenue freight loaded in 1918 actually exceeded by nearly 3 per cent the 43,408,000 cars loaded in 1944 . In the passenger traffic of World War II the increase in average length of trip was even greater . Whereas in 1918 the average passenger trip had been 39 miles , it was 105 miles in 1944 . It was the longer average trip , much more than any increase in passengers , which explained the 1944 record-high passenger business of 95,549,000,000 passenger-miles , a figure that was over twice the total of 1918 . The number of revenue passengers carried in 1918 was 1,085,000,000 , a figure actually 19 per cent higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and longer trip , typical of wartime business , were major keys in explaining the success of rail traffic in the early forties . Not only did they make for great increases in operating efficiency , but the substantially higher revenue they brought in assured the rail lines of a total operation that was increasingly profitable . As was World War I , the Second World War was a time of trouble and difficulty for railroad labor . With the new bulk of wartime traffic , the ranks of railroad labor naturally grew . Despite a loss of 351,000 men to military service , the number of rail employees expanded nearly a third during the war ,  | growing from 1,140,000 in 1941 to 1,420,000 in 1945 . In 1941 there was strong agitation from all types of railroad workers for wage boosts and for vacations with pay . When the recommendations of an emergency mediation board headed by Wayne L. Morse ( 1900- ) , University of Oregon Law Dean and later United States Senator , proved unsatisfactory to the workers , a strike was called for Sunday , December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wage concessions , and the strike was averted with an agreement announced on December 2 , 1941 . Operating employees received an average wage increase of 7.5 per cent and the lower-paid non-operating workers received an average boost of 13.5 per cent . The continued climb in the cost of living , wage increases in industry , and the obvious prosperity of the railroads soon made the workers anxious for a second increase . When their wage demands were not met , the operating unions called a strike for December 30 , 1943 . As they had done in 1941 , the workers were able to use their political influence to obtain the aid of President Roosevelt in getting increases above the recommendations of the mediation board . Needing time to work out a satisfactory agreement , Roosevelt took over the railroads . The War Department had possession of the lines from December 27 , 1943 , until January 18 , 1944 , but operations remained in the hands of railroad management and government control was nominal . As a result of the wage increases , the average annual compensation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1945 , a gain of 33 per cent . Consumer prices in the same years had climbed 19 per cent . The prospering railroads paid higher wages but still had an average labor cost per revenue dollar of only 39 cents for the five years from  | 1941 through 1945 . Railroad rates were not raised substantially during the war , and the average revenue of 0.96 cents per ton-mile in 1945 was as low as during the depression thirties . Of the 351,000 railroad employees who went off to war , more than a tenth continued to serve the transportation needs of the nation as members of railway battalions and other units of the Military Railway Service . During the war the 43,000 officers and men in the Military Railway Service operated rail mileage in such far-off places as Alaska , England , French Morocco , Algeria , Sicily , Italy , France , Germany , India , Burma , and the Philippines . The director general of the organization , Major General Carl R. Gray , Jr . ( 1889-1955 ) , like many members of his staff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most favorable aspects of wartime rail traffic was the prosperity it brought to the rail industry . Business was so good that the operating ratio for the five war years ( 1941 ? 45 ) averaged only 67.7 per cent , the lowest five-year average in the twentieth century , except for the years 1901 through 1905 , and nearly twenty points below the 87 per cent average figure for the three years of government operation from 1918 to 1920 . The average rate of return on the net property investment during the war years was 4.97 per cent , the highest five-year average for twenty-five years . While cash dividends paid during the war were not of record size , the industry put its financial house in order by retiring nearly $2,000,000,000 of funded debt . The industry 's net funded debt in the hands of the public at the end of 1945 stood at $8,659 , - 000,000 , the lowest figure since well before World War I. In contrasting the financial well-being of the railroads under private direction in World War II with the government  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Railroads pointed out that while government operation had cost the American taxpayer $2,000,000 a day , the railroads in World War II ( 1942 ? 45 ) paid average federal income taxes of more than $3,000,000 each day . Clearly , a variety of reasons contributed to the success of the railroads in meeting the transportation needs of the Second World War . The volume of freight and passenger traffic moved in the years 1941 through 1945 seemed greater because of the low rate of traffic in the depression thirties . But the major fact was that increased operating efficiency , improved trackage , better signaling , and the more scientific management of freight cars all contrived to permit a rail system with a slightly smaller carrying capacity to move a much larger total traffic than it had in World War I. Basic differences in the nature of the traffic in the two wars , such as the longer average haul and the longer average trip typical in the forties , also made the railroads ' job relatively easier in the Second World War . Both the rail industry and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of even greater importance was the stubborn insistence of the entire rail industry in 1941 that it much preferred wholehearted and unstinting co-operation to compulsion and direction by the government . To compare definitively the roles of American railroads in World War I and World War II would be difficult . The antecedent development and problems of the industry , the differing nature of the two wars , and the character of the traffic needs in 1917 and 1941 were all too different to make a real comparison possible . In 1917 and 1918 government intervention and operation was probably inevitable . In World War II  | a management of traffic that was essentially private with a minimum of government supervision was both to be expected and to be desired . In both wars the railroads of America served well .  | In the long generation since the First World War , American railroads have experienced a general decline . The year 1916 in several ways marked the end of the golden age of railroading . In that year the nation reached an all-time high in rail mileage with 254,000 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mileage was near the close of the Progressive Movement , an age of political reform and a period of increasingly stringent governmental regulation of the nation 's economic life . The new toughness in railroad regulation came at the very time when new , competitive transport facilities were appearing . In the early postwar years the old monopolistic position held so long by the railroads was lost as new modes of transport by highway and air appeared . New growth in water and pipeline transport also contributed to the major traffic losses suffered by the rail carriers . As the railroads lost freight and passenger business to the better service , and sometimes better rates and fares , offered by  | the new forms of transportation , the national rail network naturally declined . By 1959 total rail mileage had dropped to less than 220,000 miles , with most of the abandonment taking place in the thirties and forties . The best efforts of the railroads to keep their business ? by improving operating efficiency , introducing streamlined and air-conditioned passenger service , and building new forms of motive power ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By 1959 they controlled no more than 28 per cent of the total intercity commercial passenger business and only 44 per cent of the intercity freight traffic . The drop in the passenger traffic was the most marked , not only in volume , but also in profits . The railroads claim annual deficits for their passenger service for each year since 1929 , except for the four war years , 1942 through 1945 . Passenger deficits brought more curtailment of service , and by 1958 passenger service was available on no more than 48 per cent of the national rail network . Despite prospects that seemed bright at the end of World War II , the economic position of American railroads has further deteriorated since V-J Day . Railroads have failed to share equally in the bulge of postwar freight traffic that came in the late forties and fifties . In fact the volume of railroad freight ( in ton-miles ) in recent years has never exceeded that of the peak peacetime year of 1947 . Although the nation has had a widespread prosperity , the railroads , since 1945 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return on their net property investment that has ranged from 2.76 per cent to 4.31 per cent and has averaged but 3.64 per cent . In 1957 , when the four largest American airlines had a net income that averaged 7.75 per cent of their total invested capital , the four largest railroads had a net income of only 2.9 per cent .  | The relative falling off of rail traffic in the twentieth century was most intimately associated with the appearance of new , competitive transport facilities . The year 1916 was not only the year of peak rail mileage , but it also marked the resumption of an interest by the federal government in highway construction when Congress passed the Federal Aid Road Act providing grants-in-aid to the several states . Henry Ford ( 1863-1947 ) , with his durable Model T , and hundreds of other automobile manufacturers were so busy selling their product that an increased interest in good roads was inevitable . Private motor vehicle registrations reached 3,367,000 in 1916 , and as the typical American family bought its " first car " in the prosperous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1929 . Now that it was statistically possible for the entire population to be speeding along the new highways at one time , there was naturally a tremendous increase in non-commercial intercity traffic . Total intercity traffic , which had been but 42,000,000,000 passenger miles in 1916 , climbed fivefold to 198,000,000,000 passenger miles in 1929 , with more than three-quarters of the total consisting of private automobile travel . Noting the convenience , cleanliness , and novelty of the new motorbuses available in the twenties , more and more people used them for short trips . Competition was keen among the thousands of small bus companies , but consolidation and longer through service appeared with the creation of the Greyhound system in 1929 . Noting the trend , some railroads began to operate bus systems of their own . Before the end of the decade railways were running 1,000 motorcoaches over 10,000 miles of route . By 1930 the highway bus had achieved a respectable popularity and was furnishing 7,000,000,000 pas- senger-miles of service yearly , or 18 per cent of the commercial intercity traffic . The advantages of extensibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of highway transport . The more than 3,000,000 miles of roads and highways in the nation gave the bus and truck a flexibility of service that trains could never hope to equal . Hundreds of small villages and hamlets which had never seen a railroad could be served by the new highway facilities . By the end of World War II about half the roads of the country were improved highways . The smaller size of the highway vehicle ( as compared to rail facilities ) also permitted a greater flexibility of scheduling than was normal for the railroad . The door-todoor convenience and the frequent schedules , especially for the short haul , soon brought expansion to the highway freight business . The 3,000,000 trucks in the country by the end of the twenties carried less than 4 per cent of the total intercity freight ton-mileage , but the growth was great in the depression thirties . On the eve of Pearl Harbor highway trucks were carrying 10 per cent of the intercity freight , or an annual total of 62,000,000,000 ton-miles . Unregulated by the federal government until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtually free ( as compared to the railroads ) , truck operators took much traffic away from the railroads . The ability of the furniture van to move uncrated household goods meant the nearly total loss of such traffic by the railroad . In the years since World War I the railroads have lost the vast majority of their less-than-carload freight , with the total of such traffic dropping from 51,000,000 tons in 1919 to 4,400,000 tons in 1958 . The railroads also lost the bulk of their freight in animals and animal products to the truck , the  | volume of such business declining from 35,000,000 tons in 1919 to 10,000,000 tons in 1958 . Between 1922 and 1958 railroad-owned stock cars dropped in number from 80,000 to 33 , - 000 , and railroad-owned refrigerator cars dropped from 63,000 to 20,000 . By the early fifties the truck was carrying major portions of the country 's eggs , poultry , milk , fruits , and vegetables . Larger and larger shipments of manufactured goods , such as motor vehicles out of Detroit , were also being delivered via the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of the railroad , but even this was changing by the fifties . The growing trend toward heavier long-haul truck shipments was indicated in the summer of 1959 when the New York Thruway conducted tests on multi-unit " Turnpike Trains , " which could have a maximum length of 98 feet and a maximum weight of 65 tons . Competition from airlines came in these same years . Aviation had proved itself by World War I , and in May , 1918 , the Post Office Department started to operate airmail service between New York City and Washington , D.C. Transcontinental airmail service , including night flying , had been firmly established by 1925 when the Kelly Act authorized the Postmaster General to contract with private companies to carry the mail . As private contractors started to fly the mail , they also took a few passengers , carrying a total of 5,800 passengers in 1926 . The next year , Charles A. Lindbergh ( 1902 ? ) gave the infant industry a great boost with his solo flight across the Atlantic to Paris . Soon passenger service across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pennsylvania Railroad , Transcontinental Air Transport , and the Santa Fe Railway . Passengers crossed the nation in forty-eight hours , going by rail at night and flying in the daylight hours .  | All-air service soon appeared , and 73,000,000 passenger-miles were flown in 1930 . Although expansion continued in the thirties to more than a billion passenger-miles in 1940 , the total airline passenger service was less than 3 per cent of the intercity commercial passenger movement . The great growth in air travel came after V-J Day , and by 1957 roughly a third of all commercial passenger traffic was by air carriers . For many years the speed advantages of air travel were at least partially offset by the greater danger involved . In the forties both bus and train travel were roughly ten times as safe as air travel on a basis of passenger fatalities per miles traveled . In the fifties this difference in safety declined somewhat . In 1958 , when the total passenger-mileage of the three facilities was almost equally divided among them , the total passenger fatalities were : rail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1959 , however , the hazards of air travel were statistically , fourteen times as great as those of railroad travel . In the twentieth century railroads met competition from certain transportation facilities that had been established some time earlier . The first oil pipeline was built in 1865 ( its builders used two-inch wrought-iron pipe ) from Titusville , Pennsylvania , to a rail junction five miles distant . In 1867 , William H. Abbott ( 1819-1901 ) , a pioneer petroleum producer , formed the Pennsylvania Transportation Company , the first great consolidation of pipelines . In the same years that John D. Rockefeller was demanding rebates from the railroads for his oil shipments , he was also building and acquiring long-distance pipelines . By the turn of the century he controlled a network of 40,000 miles . In 1916 the pipelines of the nation carried 21 , - 000,000,000 ton-miles of liquid freight , or 4.4 per cent of the  | total intercity freight traffic . As the age of the automobile arrived , both the production and the shipment of oil products increased greatly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by 1957 more than 17 per cent ( 236,000 , - 000,000 ton-miles ) of all intercity freight was moving by pipeline . Rail shipments of petroleum products ( crude and refined ) dropped from 24 per cent of the total oil production in 1929 to 6 per cent in 1953 . The railroad loss was the greater as more and more factories shifted from coal , long a leading item of rail traffic , to oil or natural gas as fuel . Water transport was both the oldest and the least threatening competitor of the railroads . Passenger use of the inland waterways in recent decades has never been of any significant size and during most of the years since 1916 has never risen above 3 per cent of the commercial intercity traffic . Because of its lower rates , water-borne freight has always been more important . Freight on the inland waterways of the nation ranged from 15 to 18 per cent of the total ton-mileage during the period from 1916 to 1958 . Until the forties the great bulk of domestic water freight was on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the last generation has increased very slowly , and the ton-mileage figures for the prosperous fifties generally were no more than a quarter larger than those of the late twenties . By contrast , traffic on the rivers and canals has recently boomed , especially since the completion of an extensive program of inland-waterway improvements . In 1955 , 1956 , and 1957 the annual ton-mileage of freight on the canals and rivers of the United States was more than ten times the amount for the late twenties . In recent years canal and river freight movement has been roughly equal to that on the Great Lakes . It is 217 entirely possible that the recent completion of the St. Lawrence Seaway will tend to reverse this trend . As the railroads saw their freight and passenger traffic increasingly shift to different facilities in the generation after World War I , they became critical of the role of the government , both with regard to the public promotion and the regulation of the new facilities . A recent report ( 1959 ) by the Interstate Commerce Commission indicated that between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided for highways and streets . Of this sum , less than half came from highway-user taxes , and a total of $21,300,000,000 had been supplied by the federal government . Federal expenditures for rivers and harbors amounted to more than $3 , - 500,000,000 in the years 1922 through 1953 . Since 1925 the federal government has spent over $3,000,000,000 for a system of airway facilities and the construction of numerous civil airports . Unlike the railroad land-grant aid of the mid ? nineteenth century , where a quid pro quo in the form of reduced rates for government freight and troops was provided , public aid for twentieth-century transport facilities has not been accompanied by a discount for goverment business . As the railroads watched the government build highways for truckers , dredge channels for barge companies , and construct airports for private airlines , they became unhappy with their annual tax bill . Between 1950 and 1956 the railroads of the country paid to the federal , state , and local governments taxes that averaged $1,130,000,000 a year , or 11 per cent of their total revenues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those years , the railroad industry paid more than three dollars in taxes . The federal income tax took a major share , but a large portion was in the form of local  | property taxes . In Cut Bank , Montana , where a new airport had just been built with federal funds , the Great Northern Railway , along with all the other property owners in the locality , was taxed to maintain the new air terminal for the use of Western Airlines . In 1957 , when 587 passengers embarked at the Cut Bank airport , the Great Northern Railway paid $3.82 in local taxes for each departing passenger . The local property tax on the Western Airlines amounted to four cents per passenger ! In Chicago the Union Station paid taxes in 1956 of $913,000 , while city-owned Midway Airport paid no taxes at all . Feeling themselves excessively regulated in recent years , railroads also note with disapproval the difference in degree with which some of their competitors are regulated . Only about a third of all intercity truck traffic was subject to the economic control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward unregulated truck traffic has been growing since World War II . Even a smaller portion of domestic water-borne commerce is regulated ; between 1947 and 1955 less than a seventh of such traffic was under federal regulation . With considerable logic , railroad management points out the difficulty of their position in comparison with their largely unregulated water and highway competitors . The railroads especially criticize the reluctance or refusal of the ICC to permit railroads to lower their rates as they seek to compete with unregulated carriers . In recent years there have been a number of instances in which the ICC refused to let the railroads reduce their rates , based as they were on inherently lower rail costs , and instead forced the railroads to have rates high enough to permit the traffic to go by barge or truck .  | No one can claim that the railroads were unregulated in the generation since the First World War . The Transportation Act of 1920 provided a complete regulation of the nation 's rail lines . As annual rail revenues dropped to $3,000,000,000 ( lower than any year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared in the rail net income in 1932 , 1933 , and 1934 . The Interstate Commerce Commission refused the industry 's request in 1931 for a general 15 per cent hike in freight rates and instead permitted selective surcharges on certain traffic , the pooled revenue therefrom to be lent to needy railroads to permit them to meet their fixed charges . Upon the recommendation of the ICC , the Emergency Railroad Transportation Act was passed by Congress in June , 1933 . This legislation established the Federal Co-ordinator of Transportation , who was supposed to promote a new economy of rail operation through the elimination of duplicated services and facilities , the general reduction of expenses , and the lowering of fixed charges wherever possible . Joseph B. Eastman , the Co-ordinator during the three-year life of the Act , achieved only a modest success in his drive for operating economy . Most carriers ( who viewed many of the sugestions of the Co-ordinator as impractical ) were reluctant to cooperate fully in the venture . The whole effort was rendered largely ineffectual by a provision of the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employment . The 1933 legislation also changed the rate-making rule of 1920 , which had sought rates that would assure a fair rate of return on the value of the rail property . The new rule of 1933 simply required that the ICC fix rates that would be fair to carriers as well as shippers . In the middle thirties Congress also passed new railroad-labor legislation providing for ex- tensive arbitration and mediation procedures . A generous railroad retirement program was established with legislation in 1934 , 1935 , and 1937 . Recovery was slow for the railroads . The average rate of return on the net property investment in the thirties was just over 2 per cent , and in 1938 , which again showed a net income in the red , companies with 31 per cent of the total mileage of the nation were either bankrupt or in receivership . Urged on by the ICC , Congress considered new legislation , and on September 18 , 1940 , President Roosevelt signed the Transportation Act of 1940 . In a declaration of policy , the new law stated the principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this direction , since the Act provided that domestic water carriers were under the regulations of the ICC . No changes of major significance were made in railroad regulation , although minor modifications were made in the long-andshort-haul clause and the land-grant rate reductions were repealed , except for military freight and personnel . In midtwentieth century the nation 's railroads were still under nearly total regulation , even though the days of monopoly were long since gone . In the middle fifties in England , France , and Canada , where the government owned all , or many , of the rail lines , the economic regulation was much less severe . In each of these three countries the railroads have much freedom in rate-making , especially in the granting of low rates . American railroads achieved the first steps toward such freedom from regulation in the Transportation Act of 1958 . In the area of railroad consolidation , which had been one of the major proposals in the Transportation Act of 1920 , few significant developments have taken place in the last generation . The Interstate Commerce Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mandatory , and little enthusiasm for it ever appeared in the railroad industry . While the total number of railroad companies declined from 1,085 in 1920 to 635 companies in 1957 , this drop was more the result of the total abandonment of short lines than the consequence of any important consolidations . Of the 635 companies , 116 were Class I railroads ( above $3,000,000 in annual operating revenues ) , 312 were Class II railroads ( under $3,000,000 ) , and 207 were switching and terminal companies . Probably ninetenths of the 60 major lines included in Professor Ripley 's tentative consolidation plan of the early twenties still remained as separate companies at mid-century . The financial advantages that might come with merger are great . Savings in the elimination of terminals , excess trackage and maintenance , improved car routing and use , and centralized purchasing and repair work would seem to be huge . Fortune magazine ( August , 1958 ) estimated that savings would amount to at least $1,000,000,000 yearly if the railroads of the nation were combined into four great regional systems . But some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such a rail merger was that put together in the twenties by the brothers Mantis James Van Sweringen ( 1881 ? 1935 ) and Oris Paxton Van Sweringen ( 1879 ? 1936 ) . Originally real estate promoters of Shaker Heights , near Cleveland , the brothers bought control of the Nickel Plate from the New York Central in 1916 for $8,500,000 . In the next fifteen years , through a combination of financial juggling and an amazing system of holding companies , they managed to gain at least indirect control over a rail system of more than 21,000 miles , which included , in addition to the Nickel Plate , the Chesapeake &; Ohio , the Wheeling and Lake Erie , the  | Kansas City Southern , the Erie , the Pere Marquette , and the Missouri Pacific . The paper empire defaulted on a loan in 1935 and quickly collapsed . Proposals for solid and more sensible mergers appeared in the middle and late fifties . While the suggested New York Central ? Pennsylvania consolidation misfired , the autumn of 1959 saw the completion of the merger of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginian . A year later the ICC approved the Erie-Lackawanna merger . Other major proposed or pending mergers included : ( 1 ) Chesapeake &; Ohio ? Baltimore &; Ohio ; ( 2 ) Rock Island ? Milwaukee ; ( 3 ) Seaboard ? Atlantic Coast Line ; and ( 4 ) Great Northern ? Northern Pacific ? Burlington . Since all rail mergers require ICC approval , no consolidation effort ever moves rapidly . One result of new competition from other transportation facilities was the abandonment of substantial railroad mileage . From an all-time high of 254,000 miles in 1916 , the nation 's rail network dropped to 220,000 miles by 1959 , a decline of more than 13 per cent for the long generation . Most of the 34,000 miles of abandoned trackage was eliminated in the years after 1930 . In 1930 the country 's rail system still stood at 249,000 miles , and in that year the mileage of all track operated ( including double track , sidings , etc. ) was at an alltime high of 430,000 miles . Fifteen states , most of them west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the twenties , and in both 1928 and 1929 the national total for main line in operation increased slightly . The depression thirties quickly changed this trend . More than 15,000 miles of road were abandoned in the decade , and every state except Rhode Island ( which built three miles of new line ) participated in the decline . Every year from 1932 through  | 1943 saw at least 1,200 miles of line abandoned , and in 1935 the total was over 2,000 miles . Nearly 10,000 miles of additional first-line trackage were dropped in the forties , and the national total stood at not quite 224,000 miles in 1950 . Since 1950 the rate of abandonment has definitely been slower . Both the growth and the decline of railway mileage are shown in the table below .  | Since World War I most states and sections of the nation abandoned rail mileage at near the national average of from 10 to 15 per cent . Four western states ? Montana , North Dakota , Oregon , and Texas ? held their rate of decline to less than 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Arkansas , Colorado , Louisiana , Maine , Michigan , Nevada , New Hampshire , and North Carolina ? dropped 20 per cent or more of their 1916 rail mileage . Colorado , which dropped much narrow-gauge trackage , had the record rate of abandonment of 30 per cent . Railroads in the eastern district ( east of Chicago and north of the Ohio River and North Carolina ) had a rate of mileage reduction since 1916 of nearly 15 per cent , while  | southern and western state mileage declined at just above 12 per cent . This modest difference is perhaps explained by the generally greater prosperity of western and southern lines . In 1957 the ten major eastern roads had an average net income on invested capital of only 3.6 per cent ; the ten major western and southern lines averaged a 4.8 per cent rate of return . Even though the railroads reduced their mileage in the generation after World War I , they strove to meet the challenge of new competition with increased operating efficiency . Unfriendly critics of the railroads in recent years have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old  | fogies , averse to change and still living in the nineteenth century . Actually , the twentieth century has been one continuous period of increased productivity . Recent studies indicate that the average annual rate of increased productivity per rail worker has approximated 2 per cent since 1889 . The table on page 225 indicates the increased railroad efficiency during the last generation . As was noted earlier in chapter VII , the growth of rail operating efficiency was marked in the years between the two world wars ( 1921-40 ) . While the trend toward greater productivity varies in detail in recent years , there has been no material decline in the rate of increase in the forties and fifties . Both of the periods ( 1921 to 1940 and 1940 to 1958 ) reviewed in the above table show greater increase in transport productivity than the industry experienced in the two decades preceding World War I. Many gains in efficiency and operational progress came as the railroads individually and collectively engaged in systematic research projects . While many of the larger companies have set up their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on by the two hundred standing committees of the Association of American Railroads or at the Association 's own railroad laboratory and research center on the campus of the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago . In recent years the attention of the research staffs has been directed toward such varied and diverse subjects as continuous welded rail , fatigue strength of structual welds , grade-crossing protection , roller bearings , use of alloys for lightweight car construction , safe transportation of explosives , simplification of tariffs , and improvement of accounting procedures .  | Much has been done in the area of railroad communications . Radio , first used experimentally by the Lackawanna in 1914 and by the Nashville , Chattanooga , and St. Louis in 1922 , had progressed so far by mid-century that 190 railroad and terminal companies held FCC licenses for radio stations . Since World War II more than 6,000 locomotives , 3,000 cabooses , and 1,200 offices have been equipped with radio for yard or road train usage , and hundreds of walkie-talkies are in use . Industrial television , first used by the Pennsylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also available for the identification of incoming freight cars , for use in guarding rail crossings , and for the general supervision of terminal operations . Referring to its usefulness , one railroader remarked : " TV watches without coffee breaks or overtime pay and does n't complain about rain or snow . " New operating methods and devices , the result of railroad research , have been introduced in railroad yards . Many of the yard improvement programs started shortly after World War I. The Illinois Central in the twenties completed the Markham Yard near Chicago and named it for Charles H. Markham ( 1861-1930 ) , long-time president of the line . This new classification facility , when completed , was 3.5 miles long and had 113 miles of track with a capacity of 9,000 freight cars . Much of Daniel Willard 's $145,000,000 improvement program on his Baltimore &; Ohio in years from 1910 to 1927 was spent on new shop and yard facilities . The Pennsylvania Railroad 's giant new freight yard , built after World War II near Conway , Pennsylvania , cost $34,000,000 but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as to speed up freight shipments . The typical new freight yard in the fifties was using electronic devices to identify incoming trains ,  | locate broken wheels , retard cars , and weigh them while they were still in motion . Faster switching and classification methods contributed to the speed-up of freight operations . Although average freighttrain speed has nearly doubled since World War I , much of the emphasis on faster service has developed only since World War II . Since 1945 many railroads have introduced fast freights with schedules that live up to their names . The New York Central 's " Pacemaker " and " Early Bird " fast freights had schedules of nearly passenger-train speed by the time Alfred E. Pearlman ( 1902 ? ) became president of the road in 1954 . The improved freight schedules were made easier as the nation 's lines spent millions of dollars to install Centralized Traffic Control on a total of nearly 30,000 miles of road by 1957 . Improvements in roadbed and heavier rail also helped . By 1957 nearly two-thirds of the nation 's trackage weighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods of track maintenance , such as the use of track-laying machines , powered spike hammers , ballast tampers and cleaners , and detector cars for finding hidden flaws in rails , had brought increases in both economy and operating efficiency . The savings in labor made possible by the new machinery were enormous , and by 1958 the rail workers maintaining way and structures numbered only 134,000 , or less than a sixth of the total railroad employees . A unique railroad effort to keep freight business has been the introduction of " piggyback " service , the intercity transportation of truck trailers on specially equipped railway flatcars . Sometimes called " trailer-on-flatcar " service , the new approach not only creates new railroad traffic but also proves that railroaders can serve truck shippers . Niles ' Weekly  | Register in 1833 noted an early instance of such service on the Baltimore &; Ohio , but the practice was certainly not common until well into the present century . Half a dozen railroads were offering some form of piggyback service in 1953 . James M. Symes ( 1897- ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was an early booster of the new service . In 1957 the first trailer-on-flatcar shipment was sent from New York City to San Francisco , and by 1959 fiftyseven railroads were offering the service in every one of the forty-eight continental states . The Chesapeake &; Ohio was adding its piggyback equipment to passenger trains , the Milwaukee was moving bulk mail from Chicago to Wisconsin in " Flexi-Vans " on passenger trains , and more and more new automobiles were being delivered by the new service . Total piggyback carloadings in 1959 were well over 400,000 , a figure 50 per cent above 1958 and 64 per cent above 1957 . Although this was still well under 2 per cent of the total rail freight traffic , the phenomenal growth of the new service has made it one of the brightest spots in the railroad picture . As the railroads after World War I sought to maintain and expand their traffic by improving and upgrading their equipment , they were increasingly forced to finance the new equipment with a relatively new type of security , the equipment obligation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new equipment retains legal title until the railroad , with a series of regular installments , has fully paid for the equipment . Since the equipment is readily movable and can easily be sold to other railroads in the event of default , the equipment obligation features a high degree of financial safety . Many railroads , such as the Illinois Central , were obtaining new equipment in this way in the early twentieth century ,  | and equipment trust obligations had increased nearly fourfold by 1950 . Between 1945 and 1955 new equipment obligations amounted to at least 40 per cent of all new railroad capital expenditures . Since World War II the great bulk of all new rolling stock and motive power has been financed in this way . When the Diesel locomotive appeared on the American scene , it not only brought a revolution to the nation 's railways but also made possible tremendous increases in rail operating efficiency . The Diesel engine was invented in the 1890 's by French-born German mechanical engineer Rudolph Diesel ( 1858-1913 ) . Adolphus Busch ( 1839-1913 ) , a rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment , bought the American manufacturing rights in 1898 but never applied the new engine to transportation . Some success with self-propelled rail cars driven by gasoline engines was achieved in the early twentieth century by several railroads , including the Union Pacific and the Santa Fe . When early Diesel experiments failed , the General Electric Company solved the problem by combining Diesel power with electric generators and traction motors . In 1925 the first Diesel-electric locomotive was installed in regular service by the Central Railroad of New Jersey for switching operations in New York City . Several dozen Diesel switchers were in operation by the early thirties . In 1934 , Ralph Budd , dynamic president of the Burlington , sought to retrieve some of the passenger business lost in the depression thirties by using Diesel power for his new " Zephyr " streamliner passenger service . In the same year , Carl R. Gray ( 1867-1939 ) , who was managing to make his Union Pacific pay dividends in spite , of the depression , also used Diesel locomo- tives for his streamliners . In 1941 the Santa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service , but before the end of the year it was being joined by the Southern , the Great Northern , and the Milwaukee . Diesel locomotives , or , more correctly , Diesel-electric locomotives , offered a number of advantages over steam power . The new locomotives were admittedly expensive , costing , on the average , $125,000 to $200,000 per unit . In cost per horsepower this was easily double that for a new steam locomotive . But the economic advantages of high fuel efficiency , low maintenance costs , and a high degree of availability offset these high original costs . Almost literally hauling a ton of freight on a spoonful of oil , the Diesel gets at least three times as much work from the same amount of fuel as does the steam engine . Since the Diesel uses very little water , the nearly complete Dieselization achieved by the late fifties permitted the retirement of $50,000,000 worth of water-supply equipment needed for the thirsty steamers . The maintenance costs of Diesels are very low . While the average steamer requires extensive daily attention for its firebox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without having to be serviced en route . Unlike the steam locomotive , which requires an hour or two of " firing-up " before it can move under its own power , the Diesel can turn on nearly full power from a cold engine almost instantly . The absence of reciprocating parts in the driving mechanism of the Diesel also saves track from the pounding stresses typical of the steam engine . The fixed-horsepower capacity of the Diesel does not lend itself to the overloading possible in the case of the more flexible steam engine , but an extra unit or two can be added to the Diesel with little effort . Like electric locomotives on mountain grades , the Diesel- electric can also reverse its electric motors to act as brakes . By mid-century the Diesel had so clearly proved its superiority that it was beginning to replace electric motive power as well as steam . Back in the 1890 's experiments by the Baltimore &; Ohio , and the New Haven with electrified train service were so successful that within half a century twenty railroads had electrified more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles of track thus operated , and the Milwaukee had more than 900 miles of the same type . Possessing all the advantages of the electric locomotive without the maintenance worries of electrified track , the Diesel was clearly responsible for the decline from a high of 868 electric locomotive units in 1943 to less than 600 by 1957 . The greatest gains made by the Diesel were at the expense of steam . The 1,200 Diesel units of 1941 had grown during the war to 3,800 ( out of a total locomotive roster of 43,500 ) in 1945 , and in that year 7 per cent of the freight service , 10 per cent of the passenger service , and 25 per cent of the yard switching was performed by the new type of locomotive . In the decade after World War II the railroads of the nation spent $3,300,000,000 for 21,000 new engines , and 95 per cent of them were Diesels . By 1955 more than fifty major railroads owned no steam locomotives at all . Not a single new steamer was bought by the nation 's lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new form of motive power performed 92 per cent of the freight service , 93 per cent of the passenger service , and 96 per cent of the yard service . In 1958 steam locomotives numbered under 1,300 , many of them were in storage , and they handled less than 2 per cent of the freight service and under 1 per cent of the passenger and yard service . Even the Union Pacific 's giant steamers , the 7,000- horsepower " Big Boys " of Sherman Hill fame , were in storage . At the end of the fifties the railroads possessed fewer than 30,000 locomotives ( as contrasted to nearly 65,000 in the early twenties ) , but 94 per cent of them were Diesels . By 1960 it was almost easier to find a steam locomotive in a museum than one operating on a railroad . The average child saw more of them in miniature under the Christmas tree than anywhere else . The obvious economies of Dieselization had forced the raw , impersonal bleat of the Diesel to replace the nostalgic whistle of the steam locomotive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the middle decades of the twentieth century other significant changes appeared in railroad equipment and rolling stock . In freight service the changes in cost ( from $2,000 for an average boxcar in 1924 to $8,900 per boxcar thirty-five years later ) were greater than those seen in the basic dimension , type , or style of the equipment . In the years after ' World War I , greater changes were made in passenger equipment as rail management sought , with a program of modernization , to meet the competition of bus , plane , and private automobile . Both the Pullman Company and Daniel Willard 's Baltimore &; Ohio were experimenting with mechanical air-conditioning for passenger equipment in the late twenties . Although the costs for such installments might average more than $5,000 per car , many roads introduced such service in the depression thirties , and by the fifties nearly all passenger cars were thus equipped . Patents for streamlined trains had been issued just after the Civil War , and in the nineties inventor-author Frederick Upham Adams ( 1859 ? 1921 ) was issued several such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1900 to build  | in its company shops the Adams " Windsplitter , " a train which in brief tests reached a speed of over 85 miles an hour . But serious streamlining waited for the depression thirties . When Ralph Budd and Carl Gray introduced Diesel power in their passenger service in 1934 , they also introduced streamlined passenger trains . The Burlington 's stainless-steel " Zephyr " and the Union Pacific 's " City of Salina , " built of a lightweight aluminum alloy , both caught the fancy of a public which liked sleek and noiseless new trains which were free of smoke and cinders . In May , 1934 , the " Zephyr " set a world record with a 1,015-mile non-stop run between Chicago and Denver at an average speed of 77.6 miles per hour . During the thirties , as many lines introduced streamliners , a new emphasis was placed on speed . In 1930 , passenger trains operated only 1,100 miles daily at average speeds of 60 miles per hour or higher . A decade later , on the eve of World War II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles at speeds averaging a mile a minute or better . As the public in the thirties expressed a preference for the new fast streamliners with smooth roof lines , shrouded wheels , and rounded rear ends , railroad after railroad introduced name trains of the new type . In May , 1936 , Samuel Thomas Bledsoe ( 1868-1939 ) , president of the Santa Fe and another railroad man who believed in streamlined modern passenger service , helped inaugurate the fast " Super Chief " in its Chicago to Los Angeles run . The train , pulled by a new , gaily painted 3,600-horsepower Diesel , introduced regular 39-hour service between the two cities , a schedule that for the first time broke the 45-hour record run of Death Valley Scotty back in 1905 . In the forties the New York Central had nearly three dozen name trains on  | its main route , and just after World War II , in 1946 , it announced a $56,000,000 order for 720 shiny new passenger cars . More than 350 name trains were in operation in the country by mid-century . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania Railroad pointed out that a new train for its New York City ? to ? Washington service , " The New Congressional " ( electric locomotive and 18 coaches ) , had cost $3,224 , - 000 , or an investment of nearly $5,000 for each passenger . Back in 1914 an earlier " Congressional " ( steam locomotive and 7 cars ) had cost only $151,000 . The push toward modernizing and upgrading passenger service continued after World War II . One of the most insistent advocates of a new approach in railroading was Robert R. Young ( 1898 ? 1958 ) , a native of Texas weighing only 135 pounds but possessing a flair for headlines and a skill in management reminiscent of the late Commodore Vanderbilt . After a business apprenticeship with Du Pont and John J. Raskob ( 1879 ? 1950 ) , Bob Young made his first million during the dismal early thirties and by the early forties controlled the Chesapeake &; Ohio system . In 1946 the Chesapeake &; Ohio , which has very little passenger business itself , startled the railroad world with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a hog could travel across the nation without changing cars but that a human being could not . Chicago , where 500,000 Pullman passengers had to change trains in 1945 , was an invisible barrier and a " phantom Chinese wall which splits America in half . " Young had made his point . Soon several railroads announced that they would book Pullman passengers through the Windy City without a change of cars . Another railroader with imagination , John W. Barriger  | ( 1899- ) , took over the Chicago , Indianapolis , and Louisville ( renamed the " Monon " in 1956 ) in 1946 . In six years he gave the short 600-mile Hoosier line a thorough face lifting . Passenger equipment boasted new features , and sometimes a new silhouette , in postwar years . The idea of a " vista-dome " on a passenger car had been suggested in 1891 in the pages of Scientific American , and a dozen years later a dome of sorts was actually tried out on a passenger car on the Canadian Pacific . But real acceptance of the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Chicago and Minneapolis in July , 1945 . The public liked the new cars , especially along the scenic routes of the mountain West . Within a dozen years fourteen other railroads were using them , and more than two hundred such cars were in service . Fred G. Gurley ( 1889- ) , president of the Santa Fe and proud of the fact that his line was one of the three biggest users of Diesel power , thought so much of the dome idea that in 1956 , with his " El Capitan , " he introduced the new concept of a " highlevel " train . The new train provided an unobstructed view for all passengers as they rode at dome-car height . Baggage storage , larger rest rooms , and other services were on the lower level . At the same time , the New York , New Haven &; Hartford , James M. Symes 's Pennsylvania , and the New York Central ( where Robert Young had become chairman of the board in 1954 ) were all excited about several new lightweight lowlevel trains , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the riding public soon expressed a preference for Mr. Gurley 's approach to passenger-train travel . The public also liked the Burlington experiment in 1956 with " slumbercoaches , " cars which provided sleeping accommodations for little more than  | the price of a coach ticket . The new service was so popular and so profitable that by 1959 the New York Central , the Northern Pacific , the Baltimore &; Ohio , and the Missouri Pacific had all introduced comparable economy sleeping coaches . In spite of organized research and expanded Centralized Traffic Control , increased efficiency and nearly total Dieselization , streamlining and the appeal of piggyback service , railroad traffic continued to show a serious decline in the middle decades of the twentieth century . Despite the best efforts of railroad managers with imagination and the modern outlook , the railroad 's share of commercial passenger and freight traffic continued to shrink . The convenience of the truck , the speed of the airline , the economy of the bus , and the cheap relability of the pipeline contrived to reduce the railroad 's share of the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tables on page 238 . As the total American economy expanded in the twentieth century , intercity freight traffic nearly tripled in the four decades after World War I. Railroad freight in the same years has far less than doubled . By the middle fifties the railroad 's share of intercity freight traffic was less than half the total , the remainder being rather evenly divided among three major competitors . Since V-J Day railroad freight traffic has declined at least 10 per cent . By contrast , that of inland waterways has climbed 60 per cent , pipeline traffic has nearly doubled , and the business of the truck has increased nearly fourfold . And in the sixties the possibility of a fourth serious contender seemed likely . Several aircraft companies designed freight-carrying planes , ready for delivery in 1961 , capable of carrying cargoes of from 65,000 to 100,000 pounds across the  | nation in from five to eight hours at an estimated cost of three to four cents a ton-mile . The losses suffered in passenger traffic were even more severe than those in railroad freight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passenger traffic before World War I , the railroads had declined by mid-century to only a third of the commercial traffic and less than 4 per cent of the total intercity traffic ( including private-automobile mileage ) .  | Since the early days of railroading , freight revenue had been much more important than passenger revenue , but the passenger dollar had been important in the early twentieth century . In the early twenties passenger revenue was roughly a quarter of freight revenue . By the early thirties it had dropped to a seventh and then during the gas-rationing days of World War II had climbed back to a quarter . In the fifties it averaged less than a tenth of the freight revenue , and by 1959 it had dropped to 8 per cent . The decline in rail travel brought deficits . Since the early depression the nation 's rail passenger service has resulted in annual deficits every year except for the four war years . These deficits climbed to half a billion dollars yearly by 1948 and reached a record high of $723,000,000 in 1957 . Passenger service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average , $1,400 , - 000 a day ? every day ? since World War II . The annual passenger losses often came close to 50 per cent of the net railway operating revenue gained from freight service . While critics have sometimes looked askance at these figures , which were assembled from reports of the Interstate Commerce Commission , no one can deny that the losses from railroad passenger service have been substantial . Passenger deficits naturally brought a curtailment of service . In the twenties , when passenger service was still profitable , passenger trains operated , on the average , over nearly 225,000 miles of road , or on about 90 per cent of the nation 's rail system . By 1939 passenger service was limited to only 171,000 route miles , and after World War II it declined even more rapidly . In 1959 passenger trains were running on 100,000 miles of line . No passenger service of any kind was thus available on more than half of the national rail network . Early in  | 1959 at least eleven Class I railroads had no passenger service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many passenger stations were closed or consolidated . In the state of New York in 1934 the New York Central had 235 passenger stations ; in 1959 this figure had been more than cut in half , with only 113 still open . Not only the extent but the density of passenger train service was drastically curtailed . This was especially true with eastern roads , where the decline in rail travel seemed to be more severe . One hundred long-distance trains pulled out each day from the Grand Central Terminal or the Pennsylvania Station in New York City in 1958 . A decade earlier , 140 trains left daily for distant destinations . Between 1946 and 1958 the New York Central removed four of its six fast daily trains between New York and Chicago . The Pennsylvania cut its daily trains terminating in Washington from 26 to 14 in the same years . In 1957 the Pennsylvania gave up its Harrisburgto ? Washington service , saying , in effect , to the Baltimore &; Ohio : " You can haul the passenger from Washington to Chicago . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities for permission to drop its service between Washington and New York . In the five years between 1951 and 1956 , some 1,274 passenger trains were eliminated across the country . As the curtailment of train service made the typical railroad timetable grow thin , the traveling public became even more addicted to the joys of driving , the economy of the bus , or the speed of the airplane . Railroad management sometimes grew a bit irritated with a public which crowded its depots looking for stand-by rail service only when the airplanes were grounded or the highways were icy or fog bound .  | Railroad managers also complained that they remained subject to the same intensive national and state regulation of services and fares as in the days when they indeed possessed a virtual travel monopoly . A railroad can not close a depot , discontinue a train ( especially a " last train " ) , or hike a fare without regulatory approval . Most requests for rate increases are trimmed . The hearings and decisions are always slow , since , as a Boston and Maine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a carnival of oratory . " Regulatory agencies have often been unsympathetic to railroad requests for the discontinuance of trains which nobody really needed or used . For nearly thirty years the Milwaukee failed in its efforts to take off an Indiana train where the monthly revenues finally were less than a day 's wages for the train crew . In New York State the Public Service Commission refused to permit a train to be dropped where the average trip carried only 4.5 passengers served by a crew of five . When the Transportation Act of 1958 was passed , Congress went a long way toward rescuing the passenger train from local politics . This Act gave the Interstate Commerce Commission both original and appellate jurisdiction over train discontinuances . The relief afforded is partly responsible for the reduced passenger-service deficit of $500,000,000 in 1959 , the lowest in the last decade . A major reason for passenger-train deficits was simply rising costs , costs rising faster than revenue . Between 1948 and 1956 average expenses per passenger-train mile rose 39 per cent , while passenger fares rose only 15 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the viewpoint of management , the failure of railroad operating personnel to give a day 's work for a day 's pay , clearly contributed to the high costs . Following work rules unchanged since 1919 , passenger-locomotive  | crews received a day 's pay for every 100 miles run , and conductors and trainmen received the same for each 150 miles . On a sixteen-hour run between Chicago and Denver a name passenger train stops about every two hours , the chief reason being to change train crews . The crew members call it a day as they receive , on the average , more than a day 's pay for about two hours ' running time . In a recent address the chairman of the Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference , Mr. David I. Mackie ( 1903- ) , pointed out that road passenger-engine crews and freight enginemen ( a total of about twenty thousand men ) received more pay per hour worked ( from $5.71 to $6.42 an hour ) than did the nation 's seven thousand top railroad executives ( $5.57 an hour ) . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been discontinued simply because the railroad brotherhoods have rejected all proposals looking toward crew reduction . Some of the operating personnel have suggested that their unions might be willing to give in on the " featherbedding " issue if the railroads would pay overtime for night and Sunday work and give railroad labor a guaranteed annual wage . The railroad passenger problem has also been complicated and plagued by such thorny problems as the dining car , mail service , and the commuter . Even though the meals served are spartan compared to the nineteenth-century menu , railroads have not made any money on their dining-car services since World War I. Since Pullman patrons have deserted the trains even more rapidly than coach passengers in recent years , the deficits from the railroad dining car have grown accordingly . By 1954 it was costing the railroads $1.44 for every dollar they received for the high-priced victuals served to their patrons . In 1957 it cost $91,000,000 to operate the railroad 's 1,400  | diners . The year 's revenue was only $62,000,000 . Such innovations as pre-cooked meals offered on short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coast Line , or the ten-dollar meal ticket for five meals on the Santa Fe 's " El Capitan " seem to do little more than slow the rate of increase in deficits . Many roads , such as the Northern Pacific , which is proud of being the " Road of the Great Big Baked Potato , " merely chalk the losses up to good public relations . They agree with Harry A. de Butts ( 1895- ) , president of the Southern Railway , who insists : " There is no way that you can lose or pick up freight customers so fast as by the quality of the meal or the cup of coffee that you provide the traveler . " The commuter and mail problems are just as serious . Even though the annual number of passengers commuting by rail in 1959 was only half that of 1929 , they still constitute a grave financial drain on the twenty Class I railroads involved . Commuter traffic accounts for nearly a fifth of total passenger miles and about a seventh of all passenger revenue . Though fares for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he still gets a bargain compared to the normal passenger . The heart of the commuting problem is the fact that the railroads are forced to maintain large rosters of expensive equipment for what is essentially a " twenty-hour week " consisting of a couple of two-hour peak periods five days a week . The outlying shopping center , television , and the automobile have combined to rob the railroad of most of its off-hour , evening , and weekend suburban traffic . Substantially , to hike the fare seems unfair to the commuter , since he is being asked to pay the full cost of a hopeless and endless contest between a tax-paying corporation and a tax-free , community-supported highway facility . As city planners come to realize the econ- omies of speed and space available in railroad commuter service as compared to that of the private automobile , more communities are apt to give their railroads the same relief in local taxes as that recently granted to the Long Island Railroad . The railroads are also bothered by an experiment started by the Post Office Department in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever there was available space in mail-carrying planes . The railroads fear that as passenger service is further reduced , they may ultimately be left with only the bulky and less profitable second- , third- , and fourthclass mail sacks . Thus as American railroads enter the decade of the sixties they must look back upon more than four decades of relative decline , decades in which their best efforts seemed only to slow the success of the new competitive transport facilities . The battle of traffic statistics has consistently been lost to the private auto , the bus , the truck , the plane , and the pipeline , even though the railroads have fought back with Diesels , piggyback service , Centralized Traffic Control , slumbercoaches , and faster schedules . Without the notable increases in operating efficiency gained in the years since World War I , the competitive task of the railroads might well have seemed hopeless . Just since World War II , the railroads of the nation have put over $14,000,000,000 in new capital improvements , and yet in the decade and a half since V-J @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 3.5 per cent on their net investment , a figure well below that of all other major industries . In 1958 and 1959 the railroad rate of return was no higher than 2.8 per cent , and in the latter year , nineteen major lines actually operated in the red . Neither financial circles nor the general public could believe that American railroads had  | adjusted themselves too well to the transportation revolution of the early twentieth century . There was too much contrast between the airlines ' sleek and shiny new jets and the railroad passenger coaches which in 1959 had an average age of twenty-eight years . The poor health of the railroad industry could hardly be denied when one noted that the 1959 rail mileage was less than that of 1906 , although capitalized at more than twice as much ; that railroad passenger traffic in 1959 was below the level of 1905 and yet received an average fare that was only a penny per mile higher ; that railroad employment in 1959 was below the level of 1896 , with the average annual wage up nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the generation before the First World War had , by the fifties , turned a sickly yellow .  | Perhaps there has always been a " railroad problem . " Each generation in turn has felt that the existing form of rail transport presented difficulties requiring solutions or decisions . The city fathers of Philadelphia had a problem in the 1820 's when they formed the Pennsylvania Society for the Promotion of Internal Improvements and sent engineer and architect William Strickland ( c.1787-1854 ) off to England to learn what he could of early English canals and railroads . As Americans rather tardily accepted Strickland 's advice that railroads were bound to supersede canals , the builders of the new facilities were faced with unprecedented railroad problems in both engineering and finance . A generation later , Grangers , shippers , and merchants had a railroad problem which consisted of creating , at the state level , regulation sufficient to curb a facility guilty of corruption and rate discrimination . In the early twentieth century , Americans wrestled with the problem of an effective rail regulation at the federal level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of returning the roads to private  | direction after a period of government wartime control . During the depression thirties the nation tried to doctor a rail industry so sick that annual net income was often in the red , with as much as a third of the total rail mileage either bankrupt or in receivership . There can be no doubt about the severity of the railroad problem facing the nation in the decade of the sixties . Most earlier railroad difficulties came in periods when the entire nation ( or large segments thereof ) was experiencing years of economic adversity . No such troubles mark the current railroad problem , for the difficulties facing rail management since World War II have appeared during years of general prosperity rather than depression . In the four decades since the First World War the total intercity freight movement within the nation has increased nearly threefold . The railroads have been getting an increasingly smaller share of this total traffic . In no year since 1952 have the nation 's rail lines produced per capita freight ton-mileage in excess of the 1920 figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been declining even more rapidly . By 1959 Indianapolis was down to only 32 daily passenger trains , slightly more than a sixth of the 184 daily trains serving that city half a century before . Some states , such as Maine , even faced the prospect of the loss of all rail passenger service . As the freight and passenger traffic went elsewhere , the ratio of the gross railroad revenue to the national income declined seriously . Between 1939 and 1958 the rail share of the national income dropped more than half , from 5.7 per cent to 2.7 per cent . By contrast , the truckers ' share rose from 1.1 per cent to 1.7 per cent , while the income of the airlines climbed five times as rapidly as the total national income .  | Thus there can be no doubt of the existence of a problem facing the railroads and the nation . Nor can there be any doubt that America needs a healthy railroad system in the sixties and in the foreseeable future . No one can seriously suggest , or believe , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , abandoning all its freight and passenger service . The Association of American Railroads made this point very well in page advertisements which appeared in the nation 's press in May , 1958 . The ad read , in part , as follows : If Railroads did not exist ? the U. S. would have to invent them ! Suppose that everybody in the United States were to learn for the first time about a marvelous method of transportation called a railroad . The idea would be sensational . High-speed tractors running on steel rails laid on privately-owned rights-of-way , with minimum curves and grades , would be capable of pulling long processions of trailers full of merchandise . Imagine ! Trains of trailers would be kept rolling day in and day out until they reached their destinations . They would be shuttled into and out of vast marshalling yards , where the trailers would be grouped in the right combinations . Of all things . Everything connected with the procedure , moreover , would be subject to taxation . It would be expected to pay for itself . What a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their twin ribbons of steel could even haul human beings , in addition to freight . If necessary , the human beings could be bedded down and hauled from one place to another in special cars with comfortable seats and all the comforts of home . It would be an absolutely revolutionary idea ? railroading . Provided it had just been invented , that is . The basic economy of rail transportation can not be denied . Following a principle of transport as old as the Oriental jinrikisha or the travois of the American Indian , railroads pull , rather than carry , their load . Aided by the friction of steel on  | steel and the maneuverability of coupled cars riding on flanged wheels , railroads can provide mass land transportation with a minimum of power . A three-unit 4,500-horsepower Diesel can easily handle the 1,400-ton average net load typical of freight trains in 1958 and 1959 . This ratio of about three horsepower per ton of cargo is far better than anything that can be offered by the truck or the airplane . The average train produces 192 ton-miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average truck can produce only 55 ton-miles per gallon . Even under their present inefficient work rules , the railroads can outproduce trucks in ton-miles of freight per employee per year by a ratio of four or five to one . Freight rates perhaps furnish the best indication of true transportation efficiency . Since World War II average railroad freight rates have risen , even with inflation , only from 0.96 cents a ton-mile to 1.46 cents a ton-mile . At a penny and a half per ton-mile , railroad freight moves from three to four times as cheaply as highway freight . Without these low rail rates , especially for large , bulky , low-value goods , the prices of basic raw materials would zoom , prices of eastern manufactured products would be much higher in the West , and West Coast fruit and garden truck would lose much of its eastern market . The interdependent and complex American economy , as we know it in the twentieth century , would be difficult or impossible to long maintain without the railroad . Modern railroads offer advantages to a growing twentiethcentury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transportation agree that in a wartime emergency only the railroads possess the elasticity and built-in capacity to meet the greatly expanded traffic demands . The rail industry still proudly recalls its World War II performance , when it quickly ex- panded to carry three times the pre-war passenger traffic and twice the pre-war volume of freight . Any enforced substantial retrenchment on the part of the rail industry may well endanger the security of the nation . The railroad also possesses advantages in a growing peacetime economy with an expanding population hungry for space . The public probably sees the airliner as a vehicle of the wild blue yonder needing only limited acres to take off and land . Actually , the space requirements for airports are very great , especially as planes become larger and faster . Some thirteen sections of land , more than 8,600 acres , are occupied by four airports in the New York City area : Newark , Teterboro , Idlewild , and La Guardia . This is easily enough land to build a double-track railroad ( 75-foot right of way ) from New York City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commuter railroad has advantages over the highway in its requirements for land and real estate . Just as Americans know that a railroad problem exists today , so also may they be sure that their basic need for continued rail transportation demands that a solution be found to the problem . But there is no general agreement among interested parties , either in regard to the probability of finding a solution or the proper processes to be followed in achieving a solution . There should be , however , little objection to the proposition that a good place to start would be an examination of the following four areas : ( 1 ) public opinion ; ( 2 ) the government ( federal , state , and local ) ; ( 3 ) railroad employees ; and ( 4 ) railroad management . Each of these interested parties has much at stake in the current difficulties facing American railroads . Each should be subjected to the closest scrutiny to determine what legitimate contributions they may make toward an ultimate solution of the problem .  | To the extent that the railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is at least neutral toward the railroads is absolutely essential . In the mid ? twentieth century the consensus of opinion , rather than being friendly , seems to be critical and hostile toward the railroad industry . The railroad image in the mind of the man on the street is generally not one that will warm the heart of railroad management . Unlike his father or grandfather before him , the man on the street today probably never yearned as a youth to view far places from the engineer 's seat in a steam-locomotive cab . But he is a part of a public that still seems to see the rail industry as a monopoly . Railroad efficiency did create a monopoly in the nineteenth century , but that monopoly was tamed in the generation of growing regulation climaxed by the presidency of Woodrow Wilson during the Progressive Era . And that monopoly was clearly broken in the two decades after World War I as the private automobile , the bus , the truck , the airplane , the barge , and the pipeline took an ever greater share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American public still clings to the notion that railroads should be treated as a monopoly . The public sees the railroads as old fashioned , as the original pioneers of pork-barreling back in the land-grant days , and as common carriers who hate passengers . Completely enchanted by the jet age of air travel , the typical American forgets the almost complete Dieselization of the rail network and seems to believe that railroading still has a Vanderbilt at the throttle of a wood-burning , American-type locomotive . Since the railroads have small advertising budgets and since many Americans have given up rail travel in favor of the airlines and the automobile , the average citizen has little first-hand knowledge  | of the railroad industry . He certainly belongs to no organization such as that to which many Englishmen belong , the Society for the Reinvigoration of Unremunerative Branch Lines in the United Kingdom ( SRUBLUK for short ) . The depressing state of public information about our own rail network can be seen in the fact that many American grade-school children take their first train rides on short , school-sponsored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moneys for the facilities of highway , water , and air carriers are taken for granted by the American public . But when someone suggests assistance for the railroads , the public generally reacts as did the New Jersey electorate in November , 1959 , when they overwhelmingly rejected the proposal of Governor Robert Meyner ( 1908 ? ) that New Jersey Turnpike profits be used to help pay for essential passenger service on the railroads . The public reaction to any aid for railroads is apt to be , in the words of James M. Symes of the Pennsylvania Railroad , " as if burglars had asked for changes in laws against safecracking and housebreaking . " A basic change in the public 's thinking about their railroads is a prerequisite to any significant improvement in the railroad situation , for to a remarkable degree the railroad problem is not so much what it actually is as what the general public thinks it is . Equally important is a change in the climate and degree of governmental control and regulation of railroads at the federal , state , and local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that railroads are still a monopoly , so do most government regulators seem to forget that 1960 is not 1920 and that the conditions of transportation competition have significantly changed in the four decades since World War I. If , as some  | critics predict , the entire rail industry is destined ultimately to die , it will be a death much unlike the decline of other , earlier transportation facilities . A long century ago when the canal and turnpike were in decline because of new railroads , at least their efforts to compete with the new form of ' transport were not hampered or restricted by governmental action and policy . It was the rare stage-line proprietor who was restrained by the government from dropping a scheduled stagecoach route which was clearly no longer profitable . Few canal-barge operators were refused the privilege of quoting low freight rates in their efforts to fight the new rail lines . In 1960 the railroads , no longer a monopoly , do not have the freedom to drop passenger service that is clearly unprofitable . They are often required by government regulators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition ( i.e. , trucks ) a " fair share " of the traffic . Railroads desire true freedom to compete with the competition . Railroads probably deserve a better break on taxes . In the nineteenth century , when railroads were the largest single aspect of American industrial strength , every branch of the government depended upon them for support . Today they remain a prime target for the tax collector . In New Jersey , according to the ICC , the state assesses rail property at 100 per cent of its value but sets up a lower base for other taxpayers . Railroads pay a payroll tax of 6.25 per cent for pensions for their workers , while the rest of the nation ( including railroad competitors ) has a social security plan which costs less than half that much . When a railroad improves a parking lot , rebuilds a terminal , or builds a bridge , the tax bill generally goes up . The New York Central was required to build a new bridge over the Harlem River which would permit clearance for a  | new highway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $500,000 on the new $23,000,000 improvement . As the solicitor of the railroad said : " Everyone wants to milk the cow , but no one wants to feed it . " Since the national policy seems to be to keep the highways , airlines , and canals free of taxation , Mr. David I. Mackie , chairman of the Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference , suggests that the states eliminate all taxes on railroad rights of way . The success of the tax-forgiveness plan recently given the Long Island Railroad indicates that some tax relief may be on the way for other rail lines . Railroads list a motley assortment of complaints against government and its various agencies of control and regulation . Lack of regulation of the competition is one complaint . Two-thirds of all truck transportation , and a still larger portion of the traffic in the inland waterways , faces no government control . Even where regulation is present for their competitors , the railroads feel the degree of control is often unequal . Railroads are required by the ICC to preserve 258 kinds of records , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rail lines spend at least $7,000,000 a year to develop statistics required by the ICC , including such trivial items as the cost of sledges , spades , sickles , and scythes , prorated in cost between passenger and freight service . Nor do railroads like laws which require them to make expensive changes or improvements in their facilities which are for the sole benefit of their competitors . In 1953 there were 121 movable-span railroad bridges ( for the benefit of waterway traffic ) that were not opened a single time during the entire year . And , of course , railroads feel discrimination as they note the vast federal give-away programs which benefit their competitors ? the airlane , the  | highway , and the waterway ? grants which in 1959 ? 60 were averaging about $10,000,000 a day . Railroads seek from the government only the right to compete , the right to offer the public the full advantages of economical transportation which are available by the efficiencies inherent in the railroad facility . Railroads desire only equal treatment . If equality can be obtained only by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public-provided highways , airways , and waterways , then the introduction of such fees should be considered . Greater equality of treatment would probably result if railroad regulation were relaxed so that the ICC would no longer virtually be a national hoard of directors , an agency which determines , indirectly at least , many vital railroad business decisions . The public and the government should both remember that while the railroads once created a transportation monopoly , that monopoly has long since been broken . It no longer exists today . The Transportation Act of 1958 was a move in the right direction . The railroads were also encouraged early in 1960 , when President Dwight D. Eisenhower ( 1890 ? ) said of the railroads : " I think they are governed by antiquated laws and regulations , and frankly , I think some of the trouble is their own . . . . I believe we ought to have a real overhauling of all the regulations and the controls and give them a chance to be prosperous . " Some change in the condition and status of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rail workers have as much to gain or lose as anyone as the health of the rail industry is either regained or allowed to continue into an unchecked deterioration . ' Well paid though they are , rail workers can not help noting the serious decline in railroad employment  | since World War II . From a roster of more than 1,400,000 workers in 1944 and 1945 , over 600,000 had been dropped by 1959 . There was an average loss of 1,000 jobs weekly during much of the fifties . In the late fall of 1959 fewer workers ( 783,000 ) were employed by the railroads than were working in the gaslight pre ? Pullman Strike days of 1891 and 1892 . In the winter of 1959-60 , as railroad labor and management began to bargain over new wage and work rule agreements , the two sides had very different objectives . Labor sought higher wages and no change in the work rules ; management demanded an end to " featherbedding . " The presidents of the 110 member lines of the Association of American Railroads listened as the president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , outlined the case of management against " featherbedding . " The railroads claimed that excessive wage payments , needless work duplication , and unnecessary train-crew positions resulted in an annual wastage of roughly $500,000,000 , a sum nearly as large as their total net income in 1959 . Management 's criticism was leveled chiefly at the wellpaid railroad workers in engine and train service . These 200,000 engineers , firemen , conductors , and brakemen received average yearly wages of nearly $7,300 in 1958 , a figure which was still well below the average physician 's salary but one roughly a fifth higher than the median salary for college professors that year . Management would like ultimately to save $200,000,000 a year by eliminating all firemen from freight and yard nonsteam locomotives . As a precedent for their desire to hire no new firemen for engines without fires , they looked to Canada , where in 1957 a royal commission held that Diesel firemen were superfluous . In Europe most Diesel firemen have been dropped , even some of those on passenger trains . Rail manage- ment pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra pair of eyes " in the locomotive , since a head-end brakeman ( the brakeman who is stationed at the front end of the train ) shares the cab with the engineer . Management wishes to abolish the position of fireman on freight and yard Diesels gradually by hiring no new firemen . They do not propose to remove the fireman from passenger trains . Management would also like to make substantial savings through the elimination of several make-work customs . According to rail executives , the " excess crew " laws in sixteen states ( and the potentiality of the same by public utility commissions in seven other states ) legalize " featherbedding " and create many unneeded jobs . The law in New York State requires a third brakeman on all trains of more than twentyfive cars . Many Pennsylvania Railroad trains running out of Elmira , New York , thus carry a third brakeman until they reach the state line , eight miles to the south . There the brakeman returns to Elmira by train or taxi and draws a full day 's pay for his effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning the division of work between yard and road crews , rules that create penalty payments , duplicated effort , and poorer service to the public . The railroads would also like a change made in the definition of a basic day 's pay . Freight-train crews and passengertrain locomotive crews receive a day 's pay for every 100 miles , while passenger conductors and trainmen put in 150 miles . These rules date back to 1919 and were established in an era when normal freight-train speeds were 12.5 miles per hour and passenger trains averaged little more than 20 miles an hour . Railroad employers feel trapped , for they have seen technology shoot ahead while the work rules stood still . They enviously  | note the much longer work days put in by bus and truck drivers and airline pilots . As they started to negotiate with labor in Chicago in the winter of 1959-60 , railroad executives told each other about the passenger-train engineer out in Kansas who had so lush a run that 80 hours in the cab earned him $800 a month , giving him plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yielding $800 a month from the government for not growing wheat . Labor emphatically denies the claims and allegations concerning work rules which are made by rail management . Henry E. Gilbert ( 1906- ) , president of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen , claims that " featherbedding " is no greater in railroading than in other industries . Gilbert , whose union would suffer greatly should firemen be taken out of Diesels , charges that the changes desired by railroad management are designed " to render impotent the railway labor movement . " Railroad operating employees claim that actually there are far fewer choice " red apple " runs , with high pay for short hours , than the claims of management would suggest . Nearly all the proposed changes look sour to the brotherhoods . They point out that enginemen and trainmen get preferred high-paying runs only after years and years of seniority and that railroad men fail to receive overtime for working nights , week ends , and holidays . And they must pay their own expenses away from home while waiting for a return run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the basic work rules if they were given overtime pay and away-from-home allowances . Some change in the work rules is both desirable and inevitable . The railroads claim that substantial changes in work rules will permit economies and improve service sufficiently to  | attract more business , thus stabilizing or even increasing rail employment . While the general press reaction to the " featherbed " issue in the winter of 1959 ? 60 seemed to favor the viewpoint of management , there was no assurance that the pressure of labor in politics might not result in decisions similar to those of earlier railroad labor crises during World War I and World War II . The railroad brotherhoods might do well to remember John L. Lewis ( 1880 ? ) , a labor leader who never stood in the way of improved technology or the increased productivity of labor . Railroad management should take a long , objective look at itself . In many ways , railroading is a unique industry . Few other industries are as old , as extensive , or as complex . An industry which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public , a public that contrasts the ancient grandfather who punches a railroad ticket to the pink-cheeked pilot and the sprightly hostess on the airliner . The very extensiveness of the rail network ( a 220,000-mile system with more than 50,000 stations ) leaves railroads vulnerable , especially since the airlines largely serve only centers of concentrated population . Railroads are also handicapped by the inherent complexity of their rate structures and by a certain schizophrenia which forces the industry simultaneously to present itself as both progressive and impoverished . Railroads are not rich . They have one of the lowest ratios of supervisory personnel to all employees found in the American business world , and their budgets for public relations and advertising are indeed slim . But management need not sit on its hands . It should aggressively explore the possibilities of consolidation , an area which in the view of John W. Barriger , president of the Pittsburgh  | and Lake Erie since 1956 , offers the best chance for increasing the volume of railroad traffic . More railroad executives should recognize that their competition is really not among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elimination of duplicate trains , which arrive and depart at the same time , or the pooling of advertising money ( to sell the railroad industry , not particular roads ) are steps in the right direction . Some railroads have given up the crying towel and have turned instead to new programs aimed at creating new business , programs in which the railroads serve both the public and themselves . Since the thirties the Santa Fe has made traveling easier for the public and has brought prosperity to itself with a program of modernization which included a new concept of long-distance passenger travel , and the pioneer use of Diesels for its freight service . Two middle western rail executives , Harry C. Murphy ( 1892 ? ) , president of the Burlington , and Ben W. Heineman ( 1914 ? ) , chairman of the Chicago and North Western , are both better known for their action programs than for complaining . Both lines gained much good will , and some profits , from the Chicago commuter as they substantially upgraded their local passenger service before asking for another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the several middle western lines whose concern for the rest , and the pocketbooks , of their coach passengers made them introduce the very popular and profitable slumbercoaches . As successful has been the recent growth of piggyback freight service . In fact , nearly every line that has resolved to spruce up for an active competition in the mid ? twentieth century has been rewarded by keeping old customers and winning new ones . American railroads have come far in the century and a third  | since William Strickland tried to convince his contemporaries that the iron rail , the flanged wheel , and the puffing locomotive were to furnish the transportation of the future . In the decades since several major eastern cities first sought to capture western markets by building new kinds of transportation facilities , the railroads of the nation have experienced three rather distinct eras or periods of development . The first era started as Baltimore transferred its full allegience to the railroad , seeking a share in the western markets claimed by its canal-building northern neighbors . The period ended a long generation later as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern states to victory in the Civil War . The second period was the halfcentury after Appomattox . The railroads of the country had a golden age as they expanded sevenfold to a network of more than 250,000 miles and helped settle and civilize the western half of the nation . As the consumers , farmers , and shippers endured rate discrimination and financial corruption in the years of Gould and Vanderbilt , they seemed momentarily to agree with Charles Francis Adams , who had once said that it was " useless for men to stand in the way of steam engines . " But by the early twentieth century a highly developed rail system , rightly proud of its contribution to an interdependent , urban , industrial America , was being closely regulated by legislation passed in the Progressive Era . While new problems faced the rail lines in the third period , American railroads since 1917 have twice faced the rigors of war and have twice helped the nation to victory . Since World War I the railroad system has suffered a serious decline in both traffic and profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , long possessed by the railroad , has been lost , despite substantial efforts to improve
