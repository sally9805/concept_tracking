txt What 's ahead ... Washington is scrambling to build up its stockpile of businessmen . And it is n't easy . Washington reckons that if economic controls have to be clamped on because of Vietnam , it will have to import a big stable of businessmen . The government is worried because the very men it would need under war pressure ? 35- to 55-year-old middle-management executives  --  hesitate to give up their places on the corporate ladders . Washington now has a reserve corps of 3,600 businessmen it can fall back on in case of emergency . But many of them would n't qualify for Washington service for one reason or another . . So the hunt is on . The government hopes to raise the standby corps of executives to 5,000 by mid-1967 . Commerce Department specialists are canvassing 15 key commodity areas now to pinpoint willing men . ED The girding to meet an emergency is also starting to show up in American factories . More industries are being ordered to set aside still more plant capacity and hold it ready for defense priority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are called " setaside . " They assure the Pentagon of a comfortable manufacturing cushion for any emergency . Brass mills will step up their setasides each quarter this year , hitting 26 percent of capacity by next January . Copper set-asides , now fixed only on fabricated products , will soon touch copper production itself . Aluminum setasides are rising steeply . More industries may soon be affected . Where the next cohtrols will be clamped on , however , still is n't clear . But the government is eying certain chemicals , specialty electronic items , and some textiles . Trends . ? ? American corporations are finding it harder and costlier to borrow abroad . What 's more , European financial circles are irked somewhat by the sudden onslaught of fund-seeking Americans on their capital markets . European firms often compete for the same money . Thircush of American borrowing was set off by President Johnson 's voluntary program to wipe out the balance-of-payments deficit . He urged business not to take too much money overseas . So they have taken to borrowing money abroad , in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overseas . And now interest rates have gone up  --  along with European concern . American businessmen seem in for the biggest shifting of gears in their thinking since the early days of the New Deal . The United States is at least half embarked on a planned economy . Short of a political turnabout in 1968 , this course seems set . Thirty years ago the challenge was to make work , make jobs , and get people and machines busy again . In short , sufficient demand had to be generated . And government action in those days , though not always coordinated , aimed in. that direction . Now the country stands at the other end of that economic equation . Demand is there ? maybe too much of it . The economy is sucking up almost every available resource , and the government thinks it finally has the demand problem licked . Bringing supply up to match demand is the new problem . And this calls not for pump priming , but for a tighter allocation of available resources  --  not this year or next , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new twist altogether . Businessmen are beginning to see they must adjust to it if they hope to help plan it . How and why ... Another thing American business must adjust to is fewer babies . The baby boom of the postwar decade seems over . The nation 's birth rate dropped sharply last year . It was the first time since World War II that fewer than 100 babies were born to every 1,000 American women , aged 15 to 44 . All this does things to the economy . It immediately touches industries serving the baby market . Firms making baby foods will have only four million new mouths to feed this year  --  the smallest number in at least 12 years . Twenty years from now , when the post . war baby crop stops trooping to the altar , business planners can count on relatively fewer weddings and not so many houses , refrigerators , and sofas . And just think what it will do to the rice business .                 @ @ @ @
