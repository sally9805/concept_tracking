The old radio soap operas liked to pretend that Portia really faced Life . <P> But only since television has the soaper got right down to the nubby-grubby of everyday existence - suicide attempts ( The Doctors ) , incestuous desires ( Days of Our Lives ) and various physical com plaints , such as " uterine inertia " ( An other World ) . The trouble with such contemporary traumas is that no one does much about them onscreen ; the folks just sit around talking about their problems and drinking black coffee in the kitchen . The only time there is any live action in the typical soaper , it seems , is Friday . That 's when the writ ers always slip in the " tease " that will lure the listeners back on Monday . <P> Only ABC 's Dark Shadows tapes as if every day were Friday . The 30-min ute show is TV 's first gothic soaper ( Monday through Friday , 4 p.m . E.D.T. ) and the first to star a vampire . Ex plains one of the directors : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other about vampires , you would turn people off . It 's the actual vampirizing that makes the show . " No doubt about it . Dark Shadows has put the bite on a rapidly-rising audience that now aver ages 15 million viewers a week . When Barnabas the Vampire ( Actor Jonathan Frid ) goes on personal appearance tours , he is apt to pull 25,000 people at a time . At a Fort Wayne shopping cen ter , played by both Richard Nixon and Eugene McCarthy during the Indiana primary , Frid outdrew each of them - or so claims his pressagent . <P> That Certain Age . The rest of the cast is a ship of ghouls : a warlock , a 175-year-old witch ( played by a nubile blonde ) , lab-made monsters whose ev ery part is a transplant , a ghost and an agent of the devil . One of the few nearnormal human beings is the matriarch of " Collinwood , " the haunted manor that is the scene of the action . That role is filled by the show 's top-billed star , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frankly : " You reach a certain age in Hollywood when there 's a shortage of glamour roles . " <P> Collinwood is located high above the Maine coast . The time is the present , though most of last winter was spent in a flashback to the 18th century when Barnabas first won his fangs . As for the plot , even Frid himself concedes , " There are times when I have abso lutely no idea what 's going on . I 'm sure people get together to speculate on what the show is all about . " <P> <P> One of the more coherent of the mul tiple story lines concerns Barnabas ' quest for a bride . Since he comes out of his coffin home only after dark , he prefers supper dates , and six times has mixed his fatal business with pleasure . " The whole essence of my character , " says Frid earnestly , " is guilt over my hang-up-vampirism-and my bites suffer . I envy the bites of the two other vampires . They are positively erotic . " <P> Plastic Bats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of its competitors . Producer Robert Costello splices in occasional exteriors filmed on location , employs more than 100 sets in the show 's Manhattan studio , com pared with the 30 or so on most soap-ers . Instead of the customary organ stings to punctuate the drama , he uses bridges recorded by an orchestra of 23 pieces .
