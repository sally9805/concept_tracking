JAMES SPENCER LOVE <P> Ours is the only major industry where prices are lower - and yet quality is higher-than ten years ago . We have really done a job on inflation . We have done it by building up productivity faster than we built up wages . " <P> So boasts the top man in the $15 billion-a-year textile industry : North Carolina 's young-looking , wiry ( 5 ft. 10 in. , 143 Ibs . ) J. Spencer Love , 63 , who sewed up a bunch of middling mills into one efficient producer called Burlington Industries , world 's biggest weaver . By bringing in modern machinery and management and gambling heavily on the wonder synthetics , Spencer Love boosted Burlington 's sales from $651 million in fiscal 1958 to $805 million in 1959 ; in fiscal 1960 's first half ( ending March 31 ) profits will almost double , to about $17.5 million . More important , Love has shown his fellow textilemen that high productivity and low prices can whip the industry 's age-old feast-or-famine cycle . U.S. textilemen this year expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase of 12% . Right now , unfilled orders outrun inventories by a healthy 5 to 1 ; even so , wholesale prices are 8% below the 1947-49 average . <P> CHAIRMAN Love has increased Burlington 's productivity by well over 20% since 1956 . His formula : Spend just a bit more than the next fellow . To expand and improve in the past decade , he anted up some $350 million , well above the industry average . Love also kept his wage bill under control by paying a bit more than the textile average , which at $1.58 an hour is the lowest of any basic industry . That way he fended off both unions and strikes in almost all his 123 plants from South Africa to California . <P> Love built his empire on a shoestring . Son of a Harvard math professor , he studied economics at Harvard ( ' 17 ) , helped to edit the Crimson . In World War I , as an infantry major in France , he won a citation for meritorious service . With $3,000 in Army savings , 23-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gastonia , N.C. , persuaded local residents to put up another $80,000 to buy control of a clangorous old cotton mill . When cottons sagged and real estate surged in 1923 , Love sold the plant for $200,000 but kept the machinery . He moved it into a modern plant that industry-hungry boosters built for him in sleepy Burlington , N.C. , and he swung into weaving rayon when other textilemen shied away from the crude , newfangled synthetic . The Depression struck , and Love grew rich as customers switched from costly silk to cheap rayon . At 40 , he was doing a $25 million yearly business . <P> When his postwar rayon market faded as low-priced nylon came out and consumer tastes shifted , he bought his way into cottons and nylon hosiery . From 1952 to 1958 Love bought 18 key companies-often for a mere fraction of their real values . Last week , eying a new market , he was close to closing a deal to buy a major maker of carpets .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
