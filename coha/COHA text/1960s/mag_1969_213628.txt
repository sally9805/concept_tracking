" It 's marvelous to hear an audience listening , " says Alec McCowen . He heard that rapt and magic silence for seven months in the triumphant London production of Hadrian VII ( TIME , May 31 , 1968 ) . Now he is hearing it again in Manhattan , where Hadrian opened last week to critical bravos that echoed those back home . Reviewers on both sides of the Atlantic have called McCowen 's performance one of the major theatrical events of the decade . <P> The play itself provides a perfect vehicle for his skills . Hadrian is a deft dramatization by Peter Luke of fantasy and fact in the life of Frederick William Rolfe , who died in 1913 at the age of 53 and was , to put it simply , as mad as a hatter . He disgraced himself at Oxford by going to a fancy dress ball as a raven and voiding a pint of whitewash from his tail in front of the Prince of Wales . He converted to Roman Catholicism and , in pursuit of holy orders , got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vocation . " He then assumed the bogus title Baron Corvo and tried his loser 's hand at painting , photography , journalism and schoolteaching - ending his days in Venice as a mincing homosexual with a monumental case of paranoia . <P> His legacy to the world was a strange , convoluted novel called Hadrian the Seventh , in which the frustrated priest developed a fantasy of being called first to the cloth and then to the Throne of St. Peter - becoming the second English Pope in history . <P> Narcissism and Vulnerability . Luke 's play skillfully brackets Rolfe as Pope with two scenes in which Rolfe is shown in ignominious penury - freezing and starving in his London room , bullied by his landlady , harassed by bailiffs , spitting vitriol at the obdurate world . Rolfe 's real life was a dramatic contrast to the Vatican splendor of his Cinderella dream , and McCowen makes the most of it . Head cocked and shoulders hunched into a grubby purple scarf , he alternately whines with self-pity and whirls arrogantly on his persecutors , slashingly vituperative . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the power and glory : swishing his stunning robes with epicene pleasure , outwitting a cluster of conniving cardinals or charming his opponents into loyalty and love , reforming the Church singlehanded in a series of staggering coups , then meeting his martyrdom , complete with saintly forgiveness of the murderer . McCowen does all this with a command of technique that is outstanding . His ability to project emotional confusion - notably in two dramatic confession scenes - while maintaining crystalline intelligibility , is a paradigm of the elegant best in English acting style . Beyond that , he manages to evoke for Rolfe a sense of pity and affection . <P> Caught in a Dog Collar . " Perhaps I play him more sympathetically than he is , " says McCowen . " I love the man very much . " This kind of commitment to a character , McCowen feels , is the specialty of American acting , by which he considers himself strongly influenced . " American actors , " he says , " may be sometimes lacking in technique , but they are never superficial . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English-more than they will admit . I found from the Americans that there was a great deal more to my job than I had realized . "
