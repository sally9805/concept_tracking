txt The American Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers reached agreement in principle today on a profit-shar-1 ing plan new in the automobile industry . The accord on provisions tol be included in a new three year contract was announced jointly by Edward L. Cushman , American Motors vice president , and Walter P. Reuther , union president . The agreement also provides for continuation of annual improvement - factor wage increases , expected to average close to 7 cents an hour a year , and continuation of the present cost-of-living formula . The company had originally sought to eliminate these features from the new contract . Even without the profit-sharing feature , the tentative agreement provides for substantially greater improvements than were contained in contract proposals made earlier this week by the General Motors Corporation , the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation . Reuther Move Expected Mr. Reuther is expected to turn to those companies now in an effort to obtain better contract provisions than they have so far offered . He indicated some flexibility , however , and was careful not to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlement with the bigger companies . Nevertheless , he warned that General Motors and the others had better give their workers a " just " equity or they might face strikes . All three , however , have indicated an aversion to any profit-sharing approach . Their contracts , covering a total of about 490,000 workers , expire next Thursday . The contract between the Studebaker-Packard Corporation and the United Auto Workers , covering some 8,000 workers , does not expire until Nov. 30 . Negotiations have not begun between this company and the union . Mr. Reuther said that he did not plan to participate in negotiations with any of the Big Three companies until Wednesday . That would be the day following the meeting of the union 's executive board here at which , he said , a strike target would be picked . The American Motors contract , covering 23,000 workers , ' expires Sept. 6 . Oilier terms of the American Motors profit-sharing plan , which the company prefers to call " progress-sharing , " 10 per cent of the profits before taxes , after deduction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made available for workers in either cash or benefits . In the company 's last fiscal ? year this would have amounted to about $360 per worker , but the company 's profits this year are running considerably behind those of the 1960 fiscal year . Besides the 10 per cent that goes into a progress-sharing fund , an additional 5 per cent would be made available to employes in American Motors stock that has already been authorized . Here is the way the new plan would work on the basis of the company 's profits during its last fiscal year , which ended Sept. 30 , 1960 : Stockholders ' equity at Ameri- ' can Motors at the end of its 1960 fiscal year was more than $220,000,000 . This is described in the annual report as the stockholders investment and inchides capital stock , additional paid in capital and earnings re-. tained for use in the business . In that year the company , earned $105,000,000 in profits ! before taxes . From this , 10 per cent of stockholders ' equity , or , $22,000,000 , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash ! or benefits for the progress-1 sharing fund is 10 per cent ofd this sum or $8,300,000 . In ad- ! dition , 5 ' per cent , or $4,150,000 , ! Would then be made available ! to employes in the form of stock . In the current fiscal year the ' earnings of American Motors have been at a lower rate . For the nine months ended June 30 , the company earned $45,301,762 before taxes . The agreement would also increase the weekly guarantee of supplementary unemployment benefits , combined with unemployment compensation , to 62 per cent of gross pay plus 81.50 for each dependent up to four dependents . The weekly maximum of the supplementary benefit would be $40 per week . These supplementary benefits in the past have , in combination with unemployment compensation , given a laid-off worker thhe equivalent of 65 per cent of take-home rather than 62 per cent of gross pay , as in the new pact . ? The agreement would also provide a 65 per cent benefit for short work-weeks that are scheduled as such for production purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased to a possible maximum of fifty-two weeks compared with thirty-four weeks as at present . Only supplementary unemployment benefits would be paid after the expiration of unemployment compensation payments . In Wisconsin , where most of the company 's plants are situated , state unemployment compensation is paid for thirty-four weeks . Special short work-week benefit , better than the Big Three offered , was also included in the new agreement . Under this arrangement workers would get benefits equivalent to onehalf the base hourly rate of pay for each hour by which the amount of work or pay available to the worker fell short of forty hours . Thus , if a worker was employed for only thirty-two hours : in a given week , he would receive his regular pay plus half pay for eight hours ! Workers in the auto industry average $2.84 an hour , according to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics , The annual improvementfactor wage increases that American Motors agree to continue provide for 6 cents an hour in additional pay for eaCh year or 2V per cent of the hourly rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the theory that national productivity increases at the rate of about 21 per cent a year . Other provisions of the contract include : A " clear , unchangeable man . azement rights clause . " Liberalization of pensions . so that an employe retiring after Jan. 1 , 1962 , would receive retirement benefits computed on the basis of $2.80 multiplied by his credited years of service . The pension arrangement computes payments on the basis of $2.40 for past service and $2.50 for each year credited in the future Improved benefits for early retirement and permanent disability . Option for employes to convert their pension rights to enable a surviving husband or wife to receive benefits on an actuarily reduced basis . A better hospital-medical insurance program in which the portion of costs now borne by employes would be financed out of the new progress-sharing fund instead of being deducted from the workers ' weekly earnings . This was a feature that Mr. Reuther had stressed particularly in advance of negotia tions . The plan also includes payment of one-half the cost of hospital - medical coverage for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the life insurance maximum , and in weekly benefit for accidents from $45.50 to $100 . Moving allowances for workers who are transferred from a plant in one city to a facility in another . Transfer of $3,000,000 in surplus from the joint insurance fund to the newly created progress-sharing fund . Mr. Reuther and Mr. Cushman said that they were at the . ! half-way mark in reaching total agreement , pointing out that technicians were working on the precise language of the , final contract . They emphasized that final approval was contingent on securing agreement wtih respect ' to local plant working conditions . The national economic agreement is also subject to ratification of members of union locals dealing with American Motors . The portions of the pact relating to the stock aspects of the progress-sharing plan must be approved by the company 's boa-d of directors and stock'holders . At a press conference Mr. Cushman said the settlement was " clearly and demonstrably non-inflationary " although it included the most liberal benefits American Motors had ever offered . Since the new benefits are to be financed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they would not affect the determination of prices . Mr. Reuther described the ' agreement as " a most significant and historic step in the development of labor-managemerit relations in our free so I ciety .. , In an address at the University of Detroit tonight : Secrelary of Labor Arthur J. Goldberg said that the **26;668;TOOLONG would welcome any freely tiated settlement between : the U. A. W. and the other automobile companies as long as it was fair and reasonable and non-inflationary . He said the Administration had no desire to interfere or direct the terms of settlements with General Motors , Ford or Chrysler.
