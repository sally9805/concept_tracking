Most economists , businessmen and congressional experts expressed only varying degrees of doubt last January when Gardner Ackley and the Council of Economic Advisers peered at their G.N.P . projections and predicted that the economy would heat up again so much by mid-1967 that a deflationary 6% surtax on personal and corporate income taxes would be necessary . At that time , with many economic indicators turning downward , there seemed to be little reason for such a forecast . Last week , however , Ackley &; Co. had visible evidence to support their vision . <P> Policy &; Performance . In recent weeks the indicators have been moving unmistakably upward . Housing , the great industrial invalid of 1966 , has begun to recuperate ( see following story ) . Retail sales have revived , partly because of an early Easter and strong March department-store sales but mostly because the U.S. consumer has replenished his savings and is spending again . Unemployment , in spite of a dip in the factory work week , has failed to increase , and , in the most reassuring indication of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraged by the apparent speed of the inventory adjustment , with accumulation actually falling to zero in February . " The latest of the leading indicators for March verified the trend : personal income rose $3.4 billion to a record level of $613.1 billion at a seasonally adjusted rate . <P> Ackley and the Administration could take credit for part of the turnaround . Faced with unmistakable signs of recession , the Administration in the past months has shoveled funds into mort gages and freed money to speed federal construction programs . The Federal Reserve Board , meanwhile , cut the discount rate and has generally moved to make money easier . At the same time , a lag in domestic spending has almost been covered this year by an upswing in defense spending ; in the first quarter $3 billion more was spent on military needs than had been anticipated . Altogether , said Ackley , fiscal and monetary policy are now more stimulative than they have been since the Korean War . <P> <P> Discounting the Drop . Many an economist , businessman and politician , though heartened by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the stock mar ket . Investors have largely discounted falling profits ; no sooner did Chrysler Corp . announce a 71% drop in earnings than Chrysler stock went up . What interests the market now is the general economic outlook . On Administration reassurances that it is going to get better , the Dow-Jones industrial average rose for seven straight trading sessions , closed last week at 883.18.
