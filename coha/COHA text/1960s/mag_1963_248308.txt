( See Cover ) <P> Though the Pavilion was devoted to showing modern science , it looked as if it could have been the setting from a poem by Coleridge . From any angle it cast a spell . It had reflecting pools , stage-set lighting , delicate bridges , six buildings decorated with Gothic tracery . Inside , it subtly lured visitors along , stopped them just where the designer intended that they should pause and look . Probably no building put up in 1962 caused such a world of comment or brought into action so many cameras . Professional critics found dreadful flaws , but to almost everyone else the U.S. Science Pavilion , that pleasure dome of the Space Age at Seattle 's Century " 21 " Exposition , was a modern Xanadu , built for their delight , a declaration of independence from the machine-made monotony of so much of modern architecture . <P> <P> The creator of this pleasant pavilion is Architect Minoru Yamasaki , a wiry , 132-lb .

He has been picked to plan the Port of New York Authority 's giant World Trade Center , to be built on Manhattan 's Lower West Side , from where it will be a neighbor of that landmark of an earlier decade , the Woolworth Building ( 1911-13 ) . So vast are the space demands of this project that if they could be met by building one fat skyscraper , it might have <P> to be 300 or more stories high . The $270 million center will be bigger than the original Rockefeller Center , and because of this vastness alone , the size and shape of the project will keep the profession in suspense for the next two or three years .
