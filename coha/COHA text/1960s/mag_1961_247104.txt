Greyfriars Bobby ( Buena Vista ) . Once upon a time , about a hundred years ago , a frisky little Skye terrier lived in the Lammermuir Hills near Edinburgh and loved Auld Jock the shepherd with dogged devotion . One day , too old to earn his keep , the shepherd ( Alexander Mackenzie ) was heartlessly turned off the croft . The terrier followed his master to town , sat by his side while he died in a dismal padding ken , followed his coffin to Greyfriars kirkyard , plumped himself down on the old man 's grave to spend the night . " No dogs allowed ! " the sour old sexton ( Donald Crisp ) bellowed , and booted him out the gate . But that night and every night Bobby sneaked back in to sleep on his master 's grave , soon became such an object of civic admiration in Edinburgh that the Lord High Commissioner awarded him the Freedom of the City , and the right perpetual to sleep on his master 's grave . <P> Too goo to be true ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Edinburgh there stands a bronze statue of Bobby to prove it . In 1912 one Eleanor Atkinson made Bobby the dogtagonist of a novel , and now Walt Disney , who has released two other dog shows ( 101 Dalmatians and Nikki , Wild Dog of the North ) so far in 1961 , offers this glossy rebrush of the book . Children will do well to sit up and beg for the film , and even grown-up judges may affectionately award it a tear-soaked blue ribbon . Actor Mackenzie is wonderfully canty and touching as Auld Jock-and as a muttinee idol the Skye 's the limit .
