Though the 1964 Senate hearings on Bobby Baker yielded a tangy crop of headlines , they produced little else . Entrepreneur Baker remained free to pursue his affairs , a peripatetic playboy in alligator shoes . Last week , after three years , another Bobby Baker hearing finally got under way in a far less flamboyant atmosphere . The arena this time was the grimly sterile U.S. courthouse for the District of Columbia , and Baker 's accuser was the U.S. Government . <P> After thorough investigations by the Department of Justice and the Internal Revenue Service , federal authorities were bent on a conviction that could send the former Senate Democratic secretary to prison for up to 48 years . <P> Baker , his mustelid eyes darting intently about the courtroom , went on trial on nine counts of larceny , tax evasion and conspiracy to defraud the Government . The onetime boy wonder and Lyndon Johnson protege , now a pudgy 38 , is estimated to have amassed $2,000,000 in assets , though his annual Senate salary was $19,612 . In his opening statement , Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California savings-and-loan-company officials to give him $100,000 as contributions for congressional candidates in the 1962 campaign , then pocketed $80,000 for himself . Called by the prosecution , Kenneth Childs , president of the Home Savings and Loan Association of Los Angeles-the nation 's biggest S &; L company , with assets totaling $2 billion-testified that in 1962 he met with Baker , who complained that Childs 's industry was not " politically active " enough and suggested that $100,000 would be an " impressive " contribution from its California members . <P> $50,100 Wait . According to Childs , Baker listed among those in " strong need " of campaign money : Democratic Senators Carl Hayden of Arizona , William Fulbright of Arkansas and George Smathers of Florida ; G.O.P. Senators Thruston Morton of Kentucky , Everett Dirksen of Illinois , Wallace Bennett of Utah and Frank Carlson of Kansas ; and Democratic Representative Wilbur Mills of Arkansas . Childs 's testimony touched off a mass appearance in court by all eight legislators . After Mills and Fulbright took the stand and denied receiving a cent from Baker ( Mills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , Defense Attorney Edward Bennett Williams announced that he would stipulate without testimony that the others had received no money , and all were excused after being sworn . ( Quipped Dirksen : " I am going to take the $4 witness fee and frame it . " )
