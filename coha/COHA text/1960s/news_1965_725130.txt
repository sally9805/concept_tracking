Nellis ( hand on head ) in charge of the crew . A might of Confusion , Frustration and Adventure The Night the Power Failed will be recalled by the millions who lived through it as an eerie all-night fantasy when the whole machinery of life came to a halt . The city was stricken at a vulnerable moment ? the height of the Tuesday evening rush hour when millions were bound for home . It was 5:27 P.M. ; the last trace of daylight had vanished from the western sky . The canyons of the city , choked with motorists and pedestrians , were ablaze with electric light . Then suddenly the urban scene went black . Street and building lights dimmed , flickered and went out . In the East , upward of 30 million persons were stopped in their tracks . Nearly 800,000 persons were trapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trains . Millions , caught in the plunging darkness of their homes and offices , groped for candles and flashlights . Pedestrians abroad at that moment were more fortunate . The sidewalks were washed with the headlights of slowmoving traffic and presently a full moon , shining in a cloudless sky , gave them enough light to walk by without fear of hitting obstructions . The initial reaction was one of minor irritation : Most people felt they were victims of a local and very temporary power failure . Then the irritation gave way to bewilderment and confusion when the homebound millions learned that the paralysis was widespread . They were baffled particularly because they could not learn the reason for their en-trapment , A chill , gusty wind intensified the mood of helplessness for the stranded millions . Many did n't have enough pocket money to spend long hours ih bars and restaurants . With collars turned up against the cold , crowds of pedestrians started trudging the miles of ghostly streets toward home . For the young and romantic , the night was lovely . Walking the hushed moonlit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of smoke ? and marvel at the stars . The towers of Manhattan , etched against the sky like a steel engraving , their walls unbroken by window lights , seemed as cold arid uninhabitable as glaciers . For the old , the night held uncertainty and terror . Some had to ' be lifted through Ceiling panels of stalled elevators . Many had to be carried down from subway trains to the inkblack roadbed where , tugging at the coattails of the one in front , they stumbled and groped through tunnels to the nearest station and a stairway to the street . Out in the cold , they gulped eagerly at the fresh air . But then , taking stock , they found themselves still stranded and far from home . Thousands took refuge in National Guard armories thrown open to them after 8 P.M. by Governor Rockefeller . At 5:27 P.M. Maj. Gen. Robert E. Condon , director of Civil Defense for New York City , was stepping into an elevator at the Biltmore Hotel when the lobby lights dimmed and died .

He was to stay there until after midnight .
