For 33 years , while British governments have come and gone . London has staunchly kept the Labor Party in local office . Last week , in a stunning setback for Prime Minister Harold Wilson , Londoners turned out the Laborite majority in the Greater London Council and voted in the Tories . <P> Conservatives won 82 seats on the council , as against 18 for the Laborites , who had previously held 64 seats . The council is a comparatively new body that governs a region containing almost 9,000,000 people within a 620-sq. - mi. area that stretches as far north as Enfield and as far south as Croydon . <P> The overwhelming Tory vote in a predominantly urban area of that size partially reflects a working-class protest against wage freezes and other austerity measures imposed by the Wilson government . Without doubt , the elections also gave many Laborites the chance to express their dissatisfaction without having to go so far as to turn Labor out of Parliament . But the fact that the To ries also won control of ten other local councils in last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much pro-Tory as it was antiLabor.
