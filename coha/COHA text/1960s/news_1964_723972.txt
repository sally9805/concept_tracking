txt Washington , May 14 ? Senate Democints ended the investigation of the Bobby Baker scandal today amid almost unprecedented uproar and charges that Sen. Edward M. Kennedy JD. , Mass. and Sen. Mike Mansfield Mont. . the Democratic floor leader , had ridden roughshod over Senate rules . Kennedy was presiding over the Senate temporarily . By a vote of 42 to 33 the Democrats tabled a resolution by Sen. John J. Williams R. , Del. that would have made all senators subject to investigation and continued the inquiry until Sept. 1 . All 42 votes against it were cast by Democrats . Of the 33 senators voting against the move to table the proposal , 9 were Democrats and 24 were Republicans . Cuts Off Investigation The action means that the investigation will end May 31 . This will barely give the rules committee , which is conducting it , time to write a report , and will leave little time for further investigation , even if the Democrats of the committee would permit it . Mansfield and Sen. Clifford Case R. , N. J. engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the most rough and tumble hour the Senate has had in a decade . Case went down under a barrage of adverse rulings by Kennedy . But Case went down fighting , shouting that Mansfield suddenly had become a tyrant and that Kennedy had committed the " most shocking overriding of a senator 's rights " in history . Protection for Jenkins The stake in the unparalleled battle was Walter Jenkins , President Johnson 's top confidential aid . Republicans of the committee wanted to question Jenkins and had won the right to do so before the Democrats rallied their forces in the Senate chamber . ? Democrats of the committee and their party colleagues were fighting to save Jenkins , called the key figure in a perjury case , from questioning . Mansfield moved to table the Williams resolution , of which Case was co-sponsor . Lashing at Williams , Case , and their Republican supporters , Mansfield said he was weary of their " sly innuendoes and thinly veiled accusations . " Case Demands ' Recognition Case sprang to his feet , demanding to speak on a point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of saying he has been insulted , his motives have been impugned , or that he has been accused of conduct unbecoming a senator . Under Senate rules senator making such a point is entitled to the floor immediately . But Mansfield , a soft spoken man except when he is under tremendous pressure , began shouting : " I do not yield for that pan . pose . " In equally stentorian tones , Case shouted : n rise to a point of personal privilege ! " Denied Right to Speak With both speakers bellowing at once , they continued to repeat their battle cries . Changing his , Mansfield said : " I will not yield for any purpose . I ask the senator to take his Seat ! " " He is not entitled to speak out of order ! " Case shot back . " In the opinion of the chair , " Kennedy said , " the senator from Montana has not violated the rules . The senator from New Jersey will take his seat . " , Case refused , however , and continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennedy ordered him again to take his seat . With Case still shouting , Mansfield vat on : " In the 12 years that I have served in the Senate I have . got been subjected to iuch treatment , and I do not like it . Senators with knowledge of wrong doing by other senators should go before the rules committee and put up or shut up . These charges are an affront to the Senate . " " I appeal from the ruling of the chair , " Case was raging at the same time . This is a question of order . " " Mr. President , may I continue ? " Mansfield dema %Jed . " I demand the right of appeal , " Case said . Altho Senate rules provide that a senator may appeal a ruling of the presiding officer to the.entire Senate , Mansfield said : " I do n't yield for that purpose . " Finally Recognizes Appeal " This is a debatable matter , " retorted Case . An appeal is debatable under Senate rules . " The senator 's personal priv-1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The senator from Montana , " Case responded , " has imputed to me conduct unworthy and unbecoming to a senator . " Kennedy , who is no great shakes as a parliamentarian , consulted with the Senate 's official parliamentarian , who advises the presiding officer in such cases . and recognized the I appeal . " The question is an appeal , " Kennedy conceded . Sen. Spessard Holland D. , Fla. proposed , that altho the time alloted for the Baker de-1 allowed to continue . But he never put the question before the Senate . Kennedy Orders Vote Under such circumstances , the rules provide that a senator may continue speaking by reserving the right to object . Case did this , but Mansfield called for a vote on the Williams proposal . Kennedy ignored Case 's appeal and Case said : " This is a most shockiag overriding of a senator 's rights . " The time has expired , " said Kennedy , " and the clerk will call the roll for the vote . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
