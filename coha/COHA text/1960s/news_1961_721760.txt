txt New York 's 1961 Easter parade was wind-blown but wellbehaved  --  and for ten minutes wore a bonnet of snow . A shivering throng , estimated by the police at 700,000 persons , was buffeted along Fifth Avenue by gusts of up to thirty-two miles an hour . The stinging breezes cut the crowd to less than half of last year 's turnout . Shortly after 1 P. M. what the Weather Bureau called a " snow shower " swirled over the city , although the temperature was 45 degrees and skies were generally bright . Gusts knocked down police barriers along the avenue , collapsed one woman 's ten-inchhigh hair-do , shredded Easter lilies at Rockefeller Center and forced the hatted to clutch constantly at their heads . For hours , it looked as if the Easter paraders were suffering from a mass migraine . Some freak millinery bobbed by , as did a few dolled-up dogs . But a. policeman surveying the slowly shuffling promenade from the steps of St. Patrick 's Cathedral called the parade " the least commercial in years . " 5,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jammed the pews for the 10 A. N. mass . St. Thomas Protestant Episcopal Church and the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church to the north were also filled . The huge turnout of worshipers in New York for the happiest , most hopeful holiday on the Christian calendar was repeated throughout the world . About 250,000 persons packed St. Peter 's Square in Rome to receive the third Easter blessing from Pope John XXDI . Outside Jerusalem 's city walls , thousands flocked to services held at a tomb resembling the one from which the stone was rolled away on the first Easter . In Warsaw , Cardinal Wyszynski , the Primate of Poland , expressed pride in the loyal attendance at church despite " the attempts of those people who would like to rebel against Cod and shut the lips of the church ! " At near-by Lowicz , it was estimated that 80 per cent of the 20,000 people in the area had attended Easter mass . The weather was sunny but breezy in Washington , where tourists in Easter finery'caused a traffic jam as they paused to sniff and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried the day  --  and the hats  --  at Atlantic City , too . Homburgs and flowered turbans flew as 300,000 persons braved thirty-mile-an-hour gusts on the Boardwalk . Cars crawled bumper-to-bumper on White Horse and Black Horse Pikes . Among New York 's Easter promenaders yesterday was former Gov . Thomas E. Dewey , who was one of the few men attired in morning suit and black homburg . He attended a service at St. Thomas with his wife , two sons and a daughter-in-law , then strolled south to view the flowers at Rockefeller Center . Sidewalks along the center 's Channel Gardens were crowded with people ' chattering in English , French , Spanish , Swedish , Italian and German as lilies and tulips rocked wildly and lost their petals . False flowers bloomed abundantly on women 's hats , some a foot tall . Pink and lavender were favored for Easter outfits . Kimono Fashionable One of the best-dressed women in the parade was Miss Kyoko Kaneko of Tokyo . She wore a white silk kimono painted with pink and blue flowers , and a seven-foot obi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The most soberly dressed women were thirty anti-Castro Cubans in black . They marched down Fifth Avenue wearing " Out With Communists " badges . The most casual attires were sported by young pacifists protesting nuclear weapons . They wore plaid jackets , dungarees , sweatshirts and sneakers as they strode along Fifth Avenue and over to the home of the Soviet mission to the United Nations , at Park Avenue and Sixty-eighth Street . " One-two-three-four , we do n't want another war , " they chanted . " Five-six-seven-eight , why do n't we negotiate ? " And then there were those who wanted to be photographed . A goofy hat prize could have gone to six sisters , the daughters of John A. Ebe of Plainview , L. I. The girls , from 7 to 14 years old , turned up in millinery topped with a stuffed peacock , a nest with chicks and eggs , a red farmhouse surrounded by barnyard animals , a doll with parasol , an Fester basket and Greek Easter cards . Boy Scouts Shiver There were many visitors from Canada , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They stood outside the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church , their bare knees knocking in the cold . Heather Thomson of Vancouver , B. C. , complained of the chilly weather " It 's warmer back home , " she said . Her escort , Lloyd Northcott , seemed baffled by the idea of an Easter parade . " Would you tell us what an Easter parade is ? " he asked . Then he answered his own question . " I guess it just consists of a lot of people milling around , We expected more of a promenade . " In previous years the crush on the avenue near St. Patrick 's was so great that people were unable to mill about . This year they strolled freely . The avenue was closed to traffic for two hours yesterday from Forty-eighth to Fifty-sixth street , allowing more pedestrian motion , The Easter weather split across the middle of the nation . In the South and West skies were mostly sunny , with temperatures from the 60 's to the 80 's . But snow and rain marred celebrations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
