Five Branded Women ( Dino De Laurentiis ; Paramount ) . " I did not loave a German , " the proud beauty ( Silvana Mangano ) sneers at a stern chief ( Van Heflin ) of the Yugoslav partisans . " I loaved a man ! " But the partisans are n't having any of that . They have already mutilated the German sergeant ( Steve Forrest ) Silvana was committing treason with , and they are obviously determined to cut her up too . A grimy partisan approaches her with scissors drawn . Van twists her arms behind her back . Her bosom heaves . A horrible thought flashes across the spectator 's mind . Then they cut off her hair . <P> As a matter " of fact , they cut the hair off four other girls ( Barbara Bel Geddes , Jeanne Moreau , Vera Miles , Carla Gravina ) in the same town , because the sergeant evidently got around .

Kicked out of town by the Germans , who do n't like to be reminded by their presence of the partisans ' power , the fallen women take to the woods , filch food from farmhouses , steal boots and guns from dead Germans , shoot two Home Guards who try to rape them , ambush a Wehrmacht reprisal party , and finally join the same band of partisans that had punished them .

" <P> Pollyanna ( Walt Disney ; Buena Vista ) , a novel for nice young ladies , published in 1913 , by a refined New England novelist named Eleanor H. Porter , was an irresistible tearjerker that drenched the pillows of grandma 's generation and added to the language a new word for the sort of softheaded optimist who can see no evil , especially in the mirror , and who hysterically insists on confusing goo with good . The story distilled Victorian sentiment to its treacly essence , and readers of all ages lapped it up . More than a million copies of Pollyanna were sold , and by 1920 the book had been made into a Broadway hit and a Hollywood movie starring Mary Pickford . Forty years later , with his infallible instinct for what will fill the public 's sweet tooth . Walt Disney has taken Pollyanna off the back shelf and , at a cost of $3,200,000 , has photographed the little horror in throbbing colors , bloated it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Menjou .
