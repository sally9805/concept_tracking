The paintings at Manhattan 's Downtown Gallery this week range in subject from the comic to the sublime , but even the most light-hearted of them seem to carry a heavy secret . Whether involved in a child 's game or in an ancient tragedy , the chunky figures appear lost in some timeless trance : no matter how much a part of a group they are , they are always solitary . The figures pray or weep , bend in joy or agony , play out roles in a cobbler 's shop , or at the foot of the Cross . They all bear the same basic message : all men live out their lives alone . <P> <P> At 34 , Painter Morris Broderson knows more than most men about living out life alone : he has the private vision of one who was born deaf . In the past few years , his extraordinary talent has earned him recognition around his native Los Angeles ; now he has been added to the prestigious stable of the Downtown Gallery , which represents such noted older artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Zorach and Georgia O'Keeffe . Dealer Edith Halpert introduces her new artist with a ten-year retrospective , borrowed mostly from the collections of such varied celebrities as Joseph Hirshhorn and Actor Robert Preston . <P> <P> The one work in the show that seems out of place dates from 1943 , when Broderson was only 14 . It is a meticulous rendering of the muscled back of a male model , done with all the skill of a master draftsman . Gradually , Broderson came to " dislike perfect bodies . ' ' His figures became a play of shadow and form-squat , ghostly figures that can be taken as universal symbols suggesting anything from the innocence of a child 's puppet to the thunder of an ancient god . For a while , they held the stage with nothing in the background , but over the years , Broderson 's compositions have grown increasingly complex . They are the result of innumerable sketches , worked and reworked until the final structure , often an almost archaic architecture , is just right . <P> There is nothing bitter about Broderson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to themes of sadness and is fascinated by ritual . Just as he may portray a tale of rape and murder that has been repeated century after century by the Kabuki players of Japan , as in The Nun and the Skull , so he is drawn to the bull rings , where year after year man and beast have performed their ballet with death . Then he might do a painting of a little girl listening to " the sound of flowers , " or of two praying nuns , one of whom seeks , and one of whom has heard , the voice of God . Violent or tender , these are supremely lonely acts , and they are of every time and any place .
