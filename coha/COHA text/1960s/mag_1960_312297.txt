In 1507 a German geographer named Martin Waldseemller drew two maps of the known world . As research , he used the recent account of Florentine Navigator Amerigo Vespucci , who said he had found a new continent , actually South America . Waldseemller named the land after its apparent discoverer-the first use of the word America for the New World . <P> Only later did Waldseemller learn that in 1492 another navigator named Columbus had preceded Vespucci to the West . Waldseemller tried to correct his error , but the misnomer stuck . His maps , one of them a rendition of the globe in twelve elliptical segments , became rare treasures for antiquarians . <P> Last week one of the two known surviving copies of the global map turned up for sale at London 's famed auction house , Sotheby &; Co . Owned by a Polish count , the map ( 11 ? in. by 16 ? in. ) roused a gleam in the eye of Manhattan Rare Book Dealer Hans P. Kraus . He pushed the price up to $35,000 and walked off with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ancient manuscripts by plunking down $64,000 on the same day for an old ( 1480 ) French-English text , a first edition issued by William Caxton , England 's first printer . The British Museum is already nibbling for the Caxton book , but Kraus intends to bring the map " home " to the U.S. , hopes to sell it to the Library of Congress , " so Americans can see where their land was named .
