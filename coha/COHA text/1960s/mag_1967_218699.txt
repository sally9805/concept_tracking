New Day , Old Outrage <P> Sir : Thanks to Peggy and Guy Smith for the inspiration their love story gave me and to you for sharing it with the world Sept. 29 . Heaven knows that what the world needs now is love . But , Peggy and Guy are more than two people in love . They are , indeed , prophets for our time . They have had the courage to proclaim their love to a world still overburdened with a cultural overlay of prejudice . And may those no longer young learn from the parents of this brave couple . They showed us all that love can indeed be blind-blind to ignorant assumptions and fears . I 'm optimistic enough to back up my faith in their future and ours with Teilhard de Chardin 's prediction : " Today something is happening to the whole structure of human consciousness . A fresh kind of life is starting . " <P> RUTH J. DRUHAN <P> Silver Spring , Md . <P> Sir : We Georgians are doubly nauseated and ashamed that Rusk is a native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir : When I saw that your article on the Rusk-Smith wedding was under " Races , " I was annoyed . But after reading the article , I wish to thank you for an unbiased report . I only hope that the day will soon come when a Negro can come into the limelight without anyone 's feeling the need to point out his or her race . <P> JEAN ROBERTSON <P> Mount Kisco , N.Y . <P> Sir : Your glorification of the mongrelizing of races , depicted by the daughter of the Secretary of State and her bridegroom , does you no credit . The situation would be more properly ignored . <P> E. H. BRANDT JR . <P> Charlotte , N.C. <P> Sir : There will come a time when the stigma will be removed , when we will be able to marry the person of our choice without regard to color or race or religion , and with society 's blessings . A time when persons of diverse backgrounds will marry and go unnoticed by the nation 's news media , and the wagging tongues of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will indeed have won the battle against racial and religious intolerance . <P> JEANNE JACOBS <P> North Arlington , N.J. <P> <P> Raga-Rah ! <P> Sir : Hail to Gerald Scarfe 's surrealistic creation of the Beatles incarnate Sept. 22 ! And raga-rah to your smashing account of psychedelic Beatledom ! <P> GINGER HUNT <P> Piqua , Ohio <P> Sir : What with the war in Viet Nam , the opening of the U.N. , trouble in the Middle East , China and Russia , you put those insects on your cover ? I 'm glad . <P> BERT SIROTE <P> Far Rockaway , N.Y . <P> Sir : The Beatles seem to synthesize their sensations into a position of non-position that exemplifies the circular course of transcendental experience . A freedom love is revealed in a music and manner that describes a balance between nihilism and mundane involvement . <P> ELIZABETH HEATH ATKINSON <P> New Hope , Pa . <P> Sir : As a middle-aging Beatle-manic mother , may I suggest that it is not " the parents who are targets of the Beatles ' satirical gibes " but rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missionary Society tells everyone about the hair shirt she has to wear because she donated all her brassires to the Uncivilized Savages . <P> HELEN P.
