Warsaw taxicab drivers were suddenly ordered to report en masse for vehicle examination . Trains to Czestochowa did not arrive at stations , and prospective passengers were brusquely told , " There are no more tickets left . " Buses and cars were stopped for endless roadside identity checks , detours and delays . Yet , despite the obstacles thrown up by Wladyslaw Gomulka 's Communist regime , some 300,000 devout Poles last week came by bus , car , train , horseback , buggy , bicycle or foot to the Jasna Gora monastery , the nation 's most sacred shrine , which stands on a high hill overlooking Czestochowa . On May 3 , the traditional Polish national holiday , the pilgrims prayed and sang before a giant outdoor altar through some twelve hours of Masses , sermons and processions that began in steamy , 90 midday heat and lasted until a full , honey-colored moon hung in the sky . <P> It was the climax of ten years of celebrations that the Roman Catholic Church has held to mark Poland 's conversion to Christianity in 966 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , for the crowds at Czestochowa were not nearly as large as had been hoped-or feared . Church officials had predicted 700,000 pilgrims , while Communist authorities , concerned that the demonstrations might fan the coals of antigovernment resentment , had made elaborate plans to tamp down a turnout that they believed could top a million . Two major football games were scheduled to siphon off Poles who might otherwise make the pilgrimage . And more than 300,000 workers in the nearby city of Katowice turned out-on government orders-to attend a patriotic rally , while for most of the rest of Poland , May 3 was officially a regular school and working day . <P> Nonetheless , the celebration was a festive occasion . Throngs of peasant women and men , peddling sausages and souvenirs , clustered in the newly washed streets of the normally drab industrial city . When Stefan Cardinal Wyszynski arrived two days before the ceremonies , he was nearly mobbed by frantic tens of thousands , chanting wildly " Long live the Pope " * and singing the ancient Polish hymn We Want God . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasize a theme for which he and his bishops have been attacked by Gomulka 's regime : the need for Poles to forgive neighboring Germany for its World War II crimes and forget the historic enmities that divide the two peoples . " We stand on Calvary , " preached Wyszynski in the moonlight , " and hear Christ 's words of forgiveness for those who crucified him . From Jasna Gora , we the Polish bishops , and God 's representatives , we also forgive . " " We forgive , " the crowd thundered back , and the fields echoed with applause . <P> <P> *Who was forbidden to come to Czestochowa by Gomulka but nevertheless celebrated his own private millennial Mass in a small chapel among the grottoes of St. Peter 's Basilica in Rome , before a replica of Czestochowa 's renowned Black Madonna .
