txt Letters to The Times To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES It is with consternation that I note the tenor of the attacks on the Administration and Administration policies from the ranks of the Repub-1 lican party and the Republican hopefuls in the Presidential race . The quality and fervor of these attacks are not new to the political scene , but the apparent reticence of the President , Administration spokesmen and Democratic leaders to answer these attacks in kind has been doing a disservice to liberal government and its public image . In my opinion Mr. Kennedy 's Administration has offered an honest and realistic approach to the problems of today . It has not been done without opposition ; the only hope , however , for the continuance of this governmental philosophy is to maintain the widest possible public support . Whether by design or by coincidence , the news media of the country have managed to give extensive coverage to all Republican policy statements and their attacks on the Administration . And the concept of a free press demands that this be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dearth of replies from the Administration and the Democratic Ieaders ? at least what would appear to me to be an absence of hard-hitting , forthright defense of Administration policy . My own immediate reaction is that this failure in the communicative process can only do immeasurable harm to the public attitude as regards the 1965 elections . Doubts Created The techniques of Madison Avenue can not and should not be underestimated in the political arena . The Republican din in the public ear can and does create doubts , even where none existed before . Faith is diluted , support wavers , and the American public is deprived of the opportunity to evaluate a true dialogue on the issues . I do not presume to possess the political acumen of more experienced strategists in the arena of politics . I am , however , very sharply aware of my own personal reactions and attitudes , which I suggest is not a unique phenomenon . I can but call for more effective steps on the part of the Administration to repair its public image . An advanced outpost of protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as later , is the time for Mr , Kennedy to answer his Republican critics , and this answer must he repeated often enough to reach1 the same number of ears as do the attacks of Senator Goldwater , Governor Rockefeller , et al .

' Farm in Zoo ' Praised To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I am disturbed to read of the Botanical Society 's plans to discontinue the Farm in The Zoo at the Bronx Zoo to provide space for a refuge for rare animals facing extinction . This little farm provides a place for thousands of city children to see and handle farm animals that they know of only through books . Young children from nursery schools and kindergarten love to go there . It seems to me a way should be found to keep this " sanctuary " for our city 's children , even if the area provided has to be smaller . FRANCES LOPATA . New York , Oct. 8 , 1963 . Our Bases in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Es : I fail to understand why in your Oct. 2 editorial you define our recent renewal of bases in Spain as " the same old bitter pill . " Judging from the wave of antiAmerican feeling which has swept large areas of the world since the beginning of the cold war , one would expect approval of any agreement guaranteeing American interests abroad . At last we have come across a country which has not fallen for those " neutralist " trial balloons periodically sent out by Moscow . But considering your newspaper 's unwavering opposition to anything favorable to Spain unfortunately not matched by a healthy preoccupation for the dim state of democracy in some of your Asian and African " favorites " ? I am certainly not going to voice surprise at this new example of passion and lack of fair play . WILLIAM O'REILLY . Brooklyn , Oct. 2 , 1963 . Treaty a Poison To ' HE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In your editorial of Oct. 2 concerning the United States bases in Spain you describe the U.S.-Spanish military treaty as a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar coating " by the extension of the treaty for five years . Permit me to go further ; I would call the treaty a deadly poison symptomatic of the current war mentality of the United States and elsewhere . The Franco regime has demonstrated its opposition to all reform , governmental and social . It has also been opposed to the basic civil liberties that are taken for granted in the democracies of the world . Any amount of sugar-coating can not assuage the fact that Spain under Franco is , plainly speaking , a dictatorship . Is it sanity when a country , purporting to be an upholder of freedom and opposer of all dictatorships , offers support to one tyranny in the name of opposing another ? STEPHEN COURTNEY .

Art in the Soviet Union Rockwell Kent Praises Services of Institute in Moscow To THE EDITOR OF TILE NEW YORK TIMES : John Canaday 's measurement of the aims and accomplishments of Soviet art today by the yardstick of what is , with naive arrogance , termed " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs no further comment than is implicit in the likeness of the term to the ephemeral and silly so-called " art nouveau " of 60 years ago . Some day , perhaps , our concept of democracy may come at last to embrace the high ideal of a People 's Art : an art of , by and for the people . But that 's a job for people , not for critics  --  even as there may come to be in America a vast organization comparable both in its aims and composition to the Institute of Soviet-American Relations , centered in Moscow , and yet lightly dismissed by Mr. Canaday as being a place of " first and last resort " for interested visitors . American readers of The Times should be informed that the institute , so lightly spoken of by Mr. Canaday in his news article of Oct. 2 , headed by Prof. Nikolai Blokhin , president of the Academy of Medical Sci2nees of the U.S.S.R. and of the International Cancer Union , unites the leading civic , cultural and scientific organizations , groups and individuals in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " . . . there exists between the peoples of the Soviet Union and the United States of America , the two greatest world powers , a profound community of interests based on a mutual striving for collaboration and universal peace . Both the Soviet and the American peoples are vitally interested in the establishment  --  between their countries , between all states ? of relations which will open to mankind a wide path to progress , prosperity and a peaceful , happy life . " Just what help Mr. Canaday sought from the institute  --  and failed to get  --  during the period of his visit he does not make clear to the readers of his articles . Possibly it was not clearly understood by those whose help he sought . But countless visiting Americans have doubtlessly so profited by the services of the institute and the friendly hospitality of Friendship House as in no degree to condone Mr. Canaday 's ungracious disparagement . Is n't it now time that American people of all ranks and categories of activity united to give service to the high purpose for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its actions ? Roc K NV ELI , KENT . Ausable Forks , N. Y. , Oct. 4 , 1963 . Origin of Indian Summer To TILE EDITOR OF ' THE NEw YORK TIMES : Your editorial of Oct. 9 titled " Indian Summer " was particularly interesting since it reiterates a fact that has bothered word-and-phrase detectives ever since Colonial days . The origin of the term is certainly obscure . The period of mild , sunny , hazy weather we call Indian Summer is not exclusively an American phenomenon , although the term itself seems to be an Americanism . In England it has been named after various saints : St. Martin , St. Luke , St. Austin and St. Augustine . The American term has found some usage in England since the publication of John Galsworthy 's " The Indian Summer of a Forsyte " in 1918 . Some authorities have suggested this mild weather in late autumn ( or even early winter ) may be called Indian Summer because of the extended period of activity it afforded the North American Indians before the onset of winter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1963 .
