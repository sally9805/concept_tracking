The commuter town of Darien , Conn. , has recently felt much abused . Feature writers portrayed it as a horrible example of suburban depravity in the wake of the trial of 19-year-old Michael V. Smith , who got drunk at a couple of debutante parties , drove a station wagon into a tree , and killed a 17-year-old companion . All the parent-hosts were haled into court under a controversial law against giving a drink to anyone under 21 . Then , to make matters worse , a star prosecution witness at the trial , William Alpert , 20 , was arrested for the possession of marijuana . But last week the beleaguered community got a Christmas present of sorts : a spotlight on a different Michael Smith . <P> Princeton Senior Michael E. Smith , son of a fiber and burlap importer and no kin to the other Michael Smith , was selected as a Rhodes scholar at Ox ford for the next two years . Smith , like his namesake , had attended Darien public schools . He went on to the Hill School and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years running , and is now chairman of the Undergraduate Council . Smith is majoring in English and was first-string center on Princeton 's undefeated football team . <P> <P> Being 22 years old , Michael may legally accept a drink from any of his father 's friends in Darien . And for the first time in months , Darien felt a swell of civic pride .
