. DEAR SIRS : In the early morning hours of Sept. 1 , 1939 , The Polish Post Office in Danzig ( Gdansk ) was attacked by armed bands of Nazi irregulars . They formed a part of the so-called Eberhard Gruppe or Freikorps Eberhard . This attack took place while there was no state of war between Poland and Germany and prior to Hitler 's attack on Poland . The Nazi attackers were , beyond doubt , guilty of criminal action against an institution protected by law and by international agreements . Five weeks after this initial attack , after the end of the Polish campaign in October , 1939 , the Post Office defenders were sentenced to death by a Nazi kangaroo court of the same Eberhaid Gruppe In 1963 , I asked the Zentrale Stelle in Ludwigsburg to locate and to identify the persons responsible for the judicial murder of postal employees in Danzig ( including my father , Leon Fuz ) In 1964 the Nazi war criminals were located . Despite my repeated requests for the next two years , the state prosecutor at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the execution was " Justified " Accordingly , I filed an appeal to the Generalstaatsanwalt Schleswig which , in May , 1967 , upheld the negative decision of the prosecutor 's office in Luebeck In fact , he stated that the postal employees were " irregulars and could be executed without a trial " In view of this deliberate shielding of Nazi war criminals , I , throu4 my legal counsel , filed an appeal to the Oberlandesgerichi Schleswig Since Danzig was guaranteed and protected in 1939 by the League of Nations , since the Chief of the German General Staff Haider did not list Eberhard Gruppe on Sept 1 , 1939 as a unit of the German Armed Forces , and since Gunter Grass in his world bestseller , The Tin Drum , described the fateful events in Danzig , I respectfully ask your help in making public this current West German attempt to rewrite history George C Fuz , Ph D. all look alike DEAR SIRS : I was pleased to read Daniel Stern 's fine review of Cortazar 's stories The Nation , Sept 18 What puzzled me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be considered a " compatriot " of the Argentine Cortizai and Borges , except , of course , they 're all " spiks . " Oliver T Myers , Chairman Department of Spanish and Portuguese The University of Wisconsin ( Milwaukee ) deterrence of proliferation Asheville , N C. DEAR SIRS I completely agree with Prof. Marshall Wind-miller 's statement in a letter to The Nation published in the Aug 28 issue , " that the nuclear non-proliferation negotiations led by the U S. and the USSR are in reality nothing more than an effort by the big two to preserve their monopoly of power . " And this is why the negotiations have no meaning , this is why a treaty if signed can not succeed in even slowing down the arms race Even before the treaty limiting the testing of nuclear weapons was ratified in 1963 , I pointed out it would prove worthless unless the nuclear powers agreed to the destruction of their nuclear stockpiles . In an outlaw society  --  and the present nation-state system is just that  --  it is not only incredible but immoral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm while others should be disarmed The present negotiations in Geneva are absolutely meaning ( Continued on page 404 ) 386 For Whom Is Time Working ? The current session of the UN General Assembly displays what one might call paradoxically a " static flux " in international relations . In contrast to last summer 's dramatic session on the Middle East  --  the drama then being provided mostly by the stupefying Israeli blitzkrieg and the cover-up show of the Soviet Union  --  this session finds the diplomacy of the major powers at a stage of hesitation . The big question which the world 's capitals seem to be asking themselves is : " For whom is time working ? " To which each answers , hopefully , " It is working for me . " This appraisal permeates especially the situation in Vietnam . The annual debate of the General Assembly has in recent sessions provided a forum for the enunciation of the latest United States conditions for ending the war . Last year 's statement by Ambassador Goldberg brought the first official airing of the now familiar theme that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , and first of all for the cessation of bombings in the North This year 's speech provided no such new idea . True , the required guarantees were toned down from " corresponding military measures " to an unequivocal advance commitment by Hanoi to participate in " meaningful negotiations " if the air attacks were stopped . Mr. Goldberg 's statement deliberately ignored the many feelers whereby Hanoi has been indicating its willingness to talk if the bombings were ended without prior conditions ; it was as if American officials were asking the North Vietnamese leaders to shout their answer to the whole world . The word " meaningful " came to assume its full significance from almost daily American official statements , among them President Johnson 's San Antonio speech asserting his determination to pursue the war as a matter of vital national interest until Communist encroachments on Southeast Asia were definitely checked . Washington is still convinced that time is on its side and that it can achieve a military victory in Vietnam . A reappraisal may have to be undertaken before the 1968 elections , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bombings will go unheeded Conversely , Hanoi and Moscow believe that time will weaken the American will to carry on a bloody and increasingly costly war , and are waiting for that moment . A similar situation prevails in the Middle East crisis . Of all the parties directly or indirectly concerned , Israel , more than any , believes that time is its ally . Israel holds Arab territory , of which it does not intend to yield one inch , except ( and even this is not certain ) in exchange for full recognition and cooperation from the Arabs . The United States is unwilling at this point to put pressure on Israel . The Arabs want to believe that their righteous stand will eventually prevail . As for Russia , it continues to insist on the " liquidation of the consequences of Israeli aggression , " but at the same time is following very carefully the effects of the Israeli victory on the pattern of THE NATioN/October 23 , 1967 ? Arab regimes . The sense of urgency has disappeared in both Washington and Moscow with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the consequent waning of the danger of a forced military confrontation between the two major powers . p In this situation , it is generally recognized that the UN can proceed for the moment only by paper resolutions , without making any real impact on the problem . The UN . being what it is , such efforts may be expected , preferably in the Security Council , but their practical value is not overestimated by anyone , China is one area where both the United States and the Soviet Union fear that time may not be on their side . The USSR is trying to capitalize on the propaganda value of its 50th anniversary , which establishes its seniority and its achievements as the first Communist state . In Washington , Defense Secretary McNamara has reversed a trend to a limitation of the anti-missile system in order to erect a network against a possible Chinese attack . This in turn has strengthened the reluctance of non-nuclear countries to sign a treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons while the superpowers are renewing their armament race . In his office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depressed U Thant deplores the trend to violence and warns that , no matter on whose side time seems to be , it is not on the side of peace . ANNE TUCKERMAN Profiles in Opportunism The resolution offered by Sen. Charles H. Percy , calling on President Johnson to make a more determined effort to obtain greater Asian military support for the Vietnamese War , is about as demagogic a proposal as can well be imagined . The fact that it was supported by a bipartisan group of twenty-two Senators shows how many legislators would like to have the best of two worlds , without taking the risk of plumping for one or the other . The resolution was referred to the Foreign Relations Committee , where the prospect is that it will never be heard of again . Senator Percy is quite philosophical about its demise . He made his point , he says , by gaining the support of nearly one-fifth of the Senate and he does not intend to press for committee action . In this context , the resolution was a gesture intended to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and THE NATION/October 23. 1967 true , intent on sparing the lives of young Americans and making the Asians fight their own battles . The Asians have not the slightest intention of doing anything of the kind , as Percy well knows . Exhortations to battle have as little effect on them , coming from Percy , as when Eisenhower asked them to pull Uncle Sam 's chestnuts out of the fire . They suspect that Uncle is in Asia for reasons that have seemed good to successive administrations , and that have so far gained the somewhat reluctant acquiescence of the American people . President Johnson came around to some such view in his speech at San Antonio . Up to now he , and Secretary Rusk with even more assiduity , have been assuring us that we are in Vietnam to bring the blessings of democracy to the poor South Vietnamese and to persuade the North Vietnamese that they must leave their neighbors alone . At San Antonio this pretense was quietly shelved . Now we are at war in Vietnam because considerations of national interest require it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trusted spokesman , laid it on the line in his colloquy with Senator Fulbright , our defense line must run through Saigon or ( terrifying thoughts ) it might be pushed back to Hawaii . At least this is getting down to cases . The claim that our men are being maimed and killed for America 's security is either true or not true . If it is true , then they should be right where they are , and perhaps there should be more of them . It would be nice to have more Asians alongside them , and willing to fight at night instead of bedding down in the villages , but if they are too blind or cowardly that does not relieve any American of doing his duty . But if anyone believes that the loss of Vietnam would imperil American security he must be one of three things  --  stupid , paranoid or making money out of the war . Given the facts of American air and naval power , its island bases and its domination of the Pacific , the argument that we must win in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Senator Brooke has taken a stand similar to Senator Percy 's , although he is not listed among the sponsors of the Percy resolution . He declared on TV that not one more Marine should be sent to Vietnam until the South Vietnamese army starts fighting . He did make one good point when he asked why the North Vietnamese were dedicated and the South Vietnamese were not , but he has been alternately a dove and a hawk , which makes for an unpleasant spectacle . Both Mr. Percy and Mr. Brooke would appear in a better light if they followed the example of Senator Morton . We know where he stands . The Best Evidence The most convincing evidence that the President 's policy in Vietnam has run into grave trouble on the political home front is to be found in his head-on collision with Rep Wilbur Mills over the proposed tax surcharge . Any such conflict would have been inconceivable in World War II , or even in the much less defensible Korean War . The spectacle of a Democrat with a record of unquestionable loyalty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the eve of an election year , is an utterly revealing commentary on the war , and the way we were inveigled into it . American casualties have now passed the 100,000 mark . The money cost of the war per year is $30 billion , with no assurance that it will not rise if the stalemate continues . Not a single democratic nation unreservedly supports the United States . Aside from token forces , like those of Australia , the only sizable contribution comes from the Park dictatorship in South Korea , which has supplied a few brigades of mercenaries in exchange for U.S. military aid at home . Vietnam is no longer the theatre of a small war ; with the exception of the two world wars it is the most serious conflict in which the United States has engaged in this century . It contains within it the seeds of World War III . For reasons that remain obscure , since none of the President 's justifications carry conviction , the country has been led into its most precarious situation since Pearl Harbor . Yet Americans have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country was in danger or an appeal was made to their idealism . The fact that a large proportion have averted their faces from this conflict , taking refuge in apathy or in affluent spending , while a growing proportion wants us to get out of Vietnam , shows that this is not the kind of war in which Americans .1 willingly engage . Does anyone believe that if it were in any way justifiable , Representative Mills , for one , would dare to defy the President ? The fact is that if this were a normal war  --  in the sense that it carried with it as much vindication as have earlier American wars  --  it would be political suicide to oppose the President when he asks for a tax surcharge to pay for it . The offices of Representative Mills and the openly anti-war legislators would be deluged with mail praising the President and threatening vengeance at the polls . Nothing of the kind is happening , and there is no prospect of its happening . In its way , Mills 's determination not to allow the tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the 20-to-5 vote supporting him in that committee , tell as much about the Johnson predicament as the more spectacular signs A 1 of opposition in Congress , in the universities and on the streets . - , The Security of Incompetence The anti-missile network proposed by the Pentagon as a screen against a Communist nuclear attack does not mean that a nuclear attack is actually feared by Washington 's officials . On the contrary , there are strong signs they do not consider such an attack at all likely . And the very best indication that this latter is their real view lies in the Office of Emergency Planning , which , with the exception of the Subversive Activities Control Board , is the most farcical and useless government organization in Washington . Congress has given the OEP a fat budget ( $4.7 million for fiscal 1968 ) and an inflated commission ; its director is on the National Security Council , right up there with McNamara and Rusk , and he is supposed to be the President 's brain in coordinating civilian THE NATION/October 23 , 1967 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a working unit , in the event of a nuclear attack or other grave national emergency . But in fact the OEP is a travesty of preparedness and emergency planning . During the Cuban missile crisis , President Kennedy had so little confidence in the office that he excluded its director from the National Security Council 's sessions . During the blackout of the northeastern section of the United States a little more than a year ago , the OEP got everything so fouled up that President Johnson angrily ordered it to back away . A dozen bright young executives went to work at the OEP during Kennedy 's Presidency , but all hastened away , one saying on his departure , " This place is a microcosm of all the bad things that a bureaucracy can be  --  filled with old , stagnant , retired-in-place officials . " Nevertheless , for those who can stand it , the pay is good . Throughout the federal government , less than one worker per 100 is rated GS-15 or above . ( GS-15s earn at least $17,500 and can earn as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the OEP , however , eighty are paid at the GS-15 level or higher ; five get the top government salary ? $25,890 . It 's a place where friendships are paid off . The nephew of a top AFL-CIO official used to have one of the posh positions ; the son of a key Democratic Congressman graduated from college into a $15,000 public relations job at OEP . But the best example of political rewards is at the very top . Four of the five OEP directors in the last six years have been Southern political hacks ? Frank Ellis , a blustering New Orleans attorney who ran Kennedy 's campaign in Louisiana in 1960 ; Buford Ellington , a pro-LBJ segregationist ex-governor of Tennessee ; Cecil Farris Bryant , one-time segregationist governor of Florida and a business partner of labor-hating banker-industrialist Ed Ball ; and now Price Daniel , former governor of Texas . President Johnson uses such men quite openly as ward-heelers . The OEP director runs errands for Johnson , hops around the country working out deals , soothing ruffled feelings , and in other ways acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brazen in his indifference to appearances . One job assigned to the director is to supervise the stockpiling of materials that might be critical in an emergency . Last year when Bryant took over the OEP he proudly announced his ignorance of such matters . " The only thing I know about aluminum , " he told a House committee , " is that it is light and strong . " Experience did not stock his mind . At his final appearance before the Joint Committee on Defense Production this summer , Bryant was unable to answer any questions relating to market shortage , foreign sources of supply , research programs , defense borrowing authority , manpower shortages , loan programs and a variety of other topics . It simply is not reasonable to think that a President with any concern , however slight , for the security and well-being of this country would put a man of such capabilities and habits in control of the Office of Emergency Planning if he thought there was any real emergency to plan for . Bryant is now gone , and the nation 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigar-chomping Price Daniel , who cross-filed as a Republican in 1952 THE NATION/October 23 , 1967 and toured Texas smearing Adlai Stevenson as a " labor stooge " and " tool of the NAACP . " Daniel , like Bryant , was a fierce anti-federal interpositionist . He was also , both as governor and previously as U.S. Senator , a toady for the oil and gas interests , for whom his law firm frequently handles cases . That may be one explanation for Johnson 's selection of Daniel to head the OEP ; this agency has much to say about the importation of oil and the juggling of quotas . Sitting in that job , an oil man could help the industry a lot . It is something to worry about , but it is a less worry than the thought that a political tumblebug would have anything to say about running the country in the event of a volley from China . Johnson may be brutal , but he is n't so brutal as to do that to his homeland . It may be a rough barometer , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bryant or Daniel is running the OEP , Johnson foresees no trouble with China or Russia , the hammering of antimissile construction in your ears notwithstanding . Church and School The proposed new constitution for New York State , which came forth after Six months of labor and an expenditure of some $10 million , appears to have no friends except Anthony Travia and the Roman Catholic Church . It takes some kind of genius to produce a document that can evoke the disfavor of the state 's Republicans , Liberals , Conservatives , Reform Democrats , the League of Women Voters , the Citizens Union , the Protestants and the Jews , to mention only the most notable of the opponents . Travia , Speaker of the Assembly and President of the Constitutional Convention , ran the convention with remarkable efficiency . What he really wanted he was able to get , and chief among these was a resolution presenting the constitution to the people on November 7 as a single package , take it or leave it . Originally , Travia 's expectation had been to frame a constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the time the convention had completed its work there were very few goodies for anyone but the Church . Hopes for court unification , better selection of judges , home rule for cities , meaningful nonpartisan reapportionment , lower voting age , a ban on wire tapping and electronic eavesdropping , and a code of ethics for legislators disappeared one by one as the convention droned on . Except for some not insignificant but nevertheless relatively minor strengthening of civil liberties protections , the only major accomplishment was the elimination of the so-called Blaine Amendment , the ban on use of tax-raised funds for the support of parochial schools . This came about as a result of an exceptionally well-organized and well-financed campaign by the Catholic Church . By the time the convention opened its first session , the Church , and its front , Citizens for Educational Freedom , had almost enough committed delegates to insure repeal of the ban ; before it closed , Travia had decided to put all his eggs in the Catholic basket . He estimated that 40 per cent of the state 's eligible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the polls and vote for a constitution which repealed the school ban . 389 1 4 Since a third of the eligible voters do not vote at all , Travia seems sure to get his constitution approved . That is , if his assumption of a monolithic , determined Catholic vote is correct . The Church certainly hopes it is and is doing all it can to make it so . Every parish church is a center of activity to mobilize support for the new constitution , and millions of dollars are being poured into the campaign . The stakes are high , much higher even than the $700 million or more of tax-raised funds which may in time be poured annually into the parochial school system if the constitutional ban is lifted . New York , though first in wealth and second in population , is only one state , and almost every other state in the Union has a provision similar to the Blaine Amendment . " Should the campaign in New York succeed , it will be the first time in the history of the nation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support of religion . But it will not be the last ; for we may be sure that a successful campaign in New York will be followed by similar efforts in the other states , culminating ultimately in a drive to eliminate the ban contained in the First Amendment . It is the realization of this situation that is lining up the non-Catholic voters of New York against the proposed constitution . More and more the controversy takes on the appearance of a religious conflict . Both Travia and the Church undoubtedly consider this an unfortunate price that must be paid and is worth paying . The religious conflict would be inevitable and perhaps even justified if in fact the entire Catholic community supported the repeal of the constitutional ban . This is far from certain . Half the Catholics in the state do not send their children to parochial schools , and most of these may be presumed to be committed to the preservation of the public school system . Like non-Catholics , they realize that once public funds become available for the financing of private schools th .. continuance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of millions of dollars needed to maintain the private schools must come from somewhere . Some , no doubt , will come from additional taxation , which will fall most heavily on the small homeowner , for real estate bears the major burden of school taxes . The rest will come from the limited sums available for public schools , at a time when the dismal failure of the lottery has already brought on a crisis in educational financing It is these considerations which indicate that many Catholics will join the almost solid coalition of non-Catholics in voting No on November 7 . LEO PFEFFER Death in the Jungle The glee with which Che Guevara 's body  --  if it is his body  --  was carted about and displayed in Bolivia is as unedifying as the motive behind it is fatuous . One Latin American revolutionary of strikingly romantic appeal ( but in Latin America revolution and romance tend to intertwine ) is said to be dead , and thus the revolutionary movement is said to be critically stricken . Or is it rather that the dream of freedom in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that vivify its cause ? 390 ' Guevara was an Argentinian who emerged into world prominence in Cuba and was last thought to be with the guerrillas in Bolivia . He was thus styled  --  the platitude substituting for understanding ? " an international revolutionary . " But standing before the United Nations , Guevara himself said : " Revolutions are not exportable . .. . S I We are not the cause . .. the ' imperialist system ' is the cause . " When he spoke in New York , everyone was looking at this bearded young man in a beret , but few were r listening to him . So the theory persisted : Guevara goes about Latin America , lighting fires of revolt . But he did n't take revolution with him  --  he went where revolution was ? to be found . And if he is dead , the cause did not die with him . ? Antaeus and Hercules As far as Washington is concerned , the business cycle no longer exists . The premise is that when the economic indicators signal an approaching slump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures . When inflation threatens , the same measures will work in reverse . The forecast , therefore , heralds a steady rise in national income , accompanied , to be sure , by an inexorable rise in the price level but at a politically acceptable rate . .. 10 Provided the indicators are read aright and the remedies are applied in good time , eternal prosperity , with only minor fluctuations , is practically assured . The element in this scheme that it is not polite to mention is that it has been tested only in a period of war and preparation for war , with massive armaments underpin- ning it all the way . Thus , in the present Johnson phase of N ' ' guaranteed prosperity , the Labor Department has released figures showing that the escalation of the Vietnamese War has created more than a million jobs in the last two years ? up from about 3 million defense workers to 4.1 million . In political terms , if Mr. Johnson runs for re-election on a platform of peace in the future and prosperity in the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the prosperity in terms of employment , since the increase in war jobs represents 23 per cent of the total increase of 4 million jobs since 1965 . But from where Mr. Johnson sits this is not the only beneficial effect . In the same two years , the number of military personnel rose from 2.7 million to 3.4 million . That 's 700,000 young men who would have been hunting jobs if they had n't been hunting Vietcong . or supporting those who do the hunting . The combination of plus jobs and minus job-hunters is a political blessing  --  as long as it can be kept going . The fact that LBJ 's prosperity hangs precariously from 4 the war is recognized by thoughtful businessmen and economists . Of six economists quoted by The New York Times ( June 25 , 1967 ) four cited the war as a stabilizing factor . Charles B. Reeder of du Pont said : " The primary element of strength has been increases in defense spending . " Albert T. Sommers of the National Industrial Conference Board voiced a similar view : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ( Continued on page 403 ) , .. , THE NATION/October 23 , 1967 projects going . Of course , this only raises another question : Why , when the division has $1.5 million lying around practically untouched , plus $500,000 definitely untouched , does it need to finance anything with its legacy money ? The division-Registrar battle is only beginning . It will undoubtedly drag on for some while  --  especially as the Attorney General became personally involved after the last round of letters . So it 's really too early to draw conclusions . Out of fairness to the division , though , one point ought to be made . The division , apparently , is not doing anything illegal . It can account for every dollar it ever took in through its fund drives and from bequests . On the other hand , this fact alone constitutes serious criticism . It appears that the division not only can account for all its money but is still holding onto a large portion of it . Kolb , in short , is running the division like a business and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a business . For example , the division 's money was disposed of as follows before it paid off National last year : $6 million was in savings accounts ; $320,000 in checking accounts ; $1.5 million in Time Certificates of Deposit , and $2 million in investments , of which all but $150,000 was in United States Government securities . ( These are only the outstanding sums . ) If one thing can be said about this method of investing , it is that it is safe . The bulk of the division 's money is in banks . In fact , Kolb told Au-forth it was the National 's policy to insist on banking its money  --  to avoid stock speculation . That is an excellent way for a charity to operate  --  if that charity is dedicated to licking its disease quickly , since then its money will be spent almost as soon as it gets it . But , the division clearly is n't trying to land a knockout blow . By spending only the income from the Dernham Trust , by holding back millions of dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falter , it is evidently gearing for perpetuity . This may be good business but in the end it mainly benefits the banks . An example should suffice to show how this comes about One of Auforth 's auditors told the Chronicle that the Dernham Trust came to the division as a most impressive stock portfolio . After the division had reinvested the money , its yield went way down . Over all , the division 's money is earning less than 6 per cent interest . Considering the amount it has to invest , a good stockbroker could get it more than twice that amount , and do so by investing in blue chip stocks , about which there would be very little uncertainty . Even at this early stage of the investigation it may be possible to place some blame , because the division does seem to be unduly influenced by the banks . In the minutes of its June 15 fund-raising committee meeting , held in Los Angeles , one of its directors stated that the division was depositing " upwards of $8 million a year " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general manager and vice president of one of California 's largest banks . There are three main areas in which a private charity , such as the American Cancer Society , can abuse its tax-exempt status : ( 1 ) if its trustees speculate with its assets ME NATION/October 23 , 1967 for personal gain ; ( 2 ) if it spends the bulk of its money on fund raising and administration and , finally , if it accumulates its money , refusing to disburse it for its intended purposes . This last practice seems to be a particular failing of the business intellect , which sees nothing wrong in building up large cash reserves . From the standpoint of the cancer victim , however , it certainly is n't right . The millions of dollars safely socked away in bank vaults are not fighting the disease . Earlier it was said that California had the strictest control on private charity of any state . That is true , but it needs qualification . California is doing more than any other state , but the activity is still woefully inadequate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are 7,500 charitable trusts ( private charities included ) in the state , controlling more than $2.5 billion in assets . By no stretch of the imagination can two auditors ride herd on 7,500 trusts with that much money . Auforth has requested eight additional auditors plus a deputy . If he gets them  --  and the Cancer fight may be enough to shock the legislature into granting his request ? California will then have , not only the best trust regulatory body in the country but the only one equipped to do an effective job . The abuses a really effective Registry could uncover might bring about regulation on the federal level . Antaeus and Hercules ( Continued from page 390 ) decline in the private sector . " Nat Goldfinger , AFL-CIO : " Until we achieve some better balance in the private economy the increases in defense expenditures will be essentially off-setting weaknesses in private activity . " Raymond J. Saulnier , Barnard College : " It is now quite plain that the U S economy has successfully staved off the overall recession threatened earlier this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strongly rising volume of defense spending , it was mild . . . . " Hobart Rowen , the economic columnist of The Washington Post , wrote to the same effect on July 2 : " Obviously , the Johnson Administration anticipates that much of that zip will develop from the unhappy need to expand the war . " Of course there is always the problem of distributing the economic zip more or less equitably , and on this delicate point the Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. of New York makes some observations in a piece titled " Defense Spending : Before and Since Vietnam " : " Complete data on contract placements are not yet available for fiscal 1967 , but the pattern . . . is discernible in earlier figures . Between fiscal 1965 and fiscal 1966 , the sharpest increases in order placements occurred in ammunition ( up almost 270 per cent ) , textiles and clothing ( up more than 240 per cent ) , vehicles ( up more than 80 per cent ) , weapons ( up almost 70 per cent ) , and food ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar total of military contracts placed for missile and space systems declined slightly .. .. Thus many of the older industrial communities in the East and Midwest , long bases of traditional industries , have felt a re-403 newed upsurge of military orders . Conversely , parts of the West Coast which have attracted the newer aerospace and electronics enterprises have seen military contracts decline relatively , even though their contract totals remain large in absolute terms . " Even so , there are those in the financial community who have some doubts about the ongoing character of the boom , among them J. A. Livingston . Not so long ago Mr. Livingston wrote in his syndicated financial column : " Vietnam has been to the current boom what the earth was to Antaeus  --  a source of invigoration . Each time the economy has faltered , federal outlays have boosted aggregate demand . Antaeus was able to best all corners because every time he touched the ground he regained strength , while his opponent tired . But Hercules discovered Antaeus ' secret , held him aloft and strangled him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the fount of everlasting strength , give out ? Shame on me ! To ask the question is to doomsay . " The Victims In our issue of May 29 we commended Sen. Edward Kennedy for launching an investigation of civilian casualties in Vietnam . Open hearings before Senator Kennedy 's Judiciary Subcommittee on Refugees are now being held . The Senator says he arranged the hearings in order to persuade the government to recognize the situation and " rearrange its priorities " He feels that simple compassion should be acknowledged as a factor in politics ; in this case , that it would bring the peoples of South Vietnam and the United States closer together . It is obvious , as a corollary , that the enormous toll of wounded civilians , and the neglect resulting from lack of hospital facilities , must be contributing to the rising tide of anti-Americanism . As a result of Mr. Kennedy 's probing , an official six-man investigating team was sent to Vietnam by the Agency for International Development . This group was headed by Dr. F. J. L. Blasingame , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other members were equally distinguished physicians . They reported that it is impossible to estimate accurately the number of civilian casualties or the cause of their injuries , but their impression was that an estimate of 75,000 per year is too high . Official U.S. and Vietnamese reports place the number at about 50,000 . Even if the lower figure is accepted , the situation is appalling , since the medical facilities are primitive and the suffering of those who survive must be excruciating Thousands of Vietnamese noncombatants who might recover in U.S.-operated hospitals either die or are permanently crippled . Our country is accumulating a load of guilt in Vietnam that can never be expiated  --  and that Asians will never forget . To make the situation worse , in The New York Times of October 10 , Neil Sheehan reports from Washington that AID intends to reduce its budget for medical assistance to South Vietnam this year , despite recommendations to the contrary from Dr. Blasingame 's field team . A blunt comment on an increasingly deplorable situation comes from a member of the Blasingame mission , Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hospital . " The medical program and civilian casualties , " says Dr. Knowles , " have been put at the lowest and dirtiest end of the stick . " Dr. Henry Mayer of Redwood City , Calif. , has also been to Vietnam as one of three representatives of the Committee for Responsibility . The other two members are Dr. John Constable , a plastic surgeon from Boston , and Dr. Theodore Tapper , a Philadelphia pediatrician A summary of their findings appears in an interview with Dr. Mayer in the June 29 issue of the Bay Guardian of San Francisco . In the countryside , about 150 Vietnamese doctors are available to care for nearly 12 million people . Many of the physicians are poorly trained by American standards  --  some are not aware that in blood transfusions patient and donor must be matched for blood type . Only about 2 per cent of the South Vietnamese budget goes to the Ministry of Health There is one hospital for each of forty-six provinces . These facilities are now swamped with thousands of war casualties . most of them attributable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manage to provide decent care , but for the most part the conditions would horrify our public  --  if it knew about them . It is of the most utmost importance that the three physicians who represented the Committee for Responsibility should be heard by the Kennedy committee , and that the United States should cease to regard the situation among Vietnamese noncombatants with callous equanimity .
