In the midst of his speech on the Berlin crisis , President John F. Kennedy took time to remind his listeners that the West faced an equally dangerous Communist challenge 5,000 miles away on the other side of the world-in Southeast Asia , where , said the President , " the borders are less guarded , the enemy harder to find , and the dangers of Communism less apparent to those who have so little . " <P> Every night furtive little bands of Communist guerrillas , dressed in black peasant pajamas or faded khakis , splash through the marshes of the Mekong Delta or dart silently along jungle paths of South Viet Nam , pursuing their intent , murderous missions . On the road from Banmethuot last week , one band melted into the shadows as two members of the National Assembly approached in their Jeep . Then , at a signal from their leader , they raised their ancient rifles , clubs and swords and pounced with bloodcurdling cries . Seconds later , the two assemblymen lay dead , and the grim struggle to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims . <P> <P> Booby Traps &; Bridges . It is an ugly , elusive war , fought with all the clever stunts in the guerrilla 's handbook , not all of them deadly . Gangs disguised as official mosquito-spray teams walk into villages to confiscate farm equipment in the name of the government ; sometimes they tear up peasants ' identity cards to disrupt local administration ; the Communists even managed to sabotage the national census by substituting falsified lists in some areas . The Viet Cong , which is what the Communist Vietnamese are called , are everywhere : tossing grenades into isolated villages in the rice fields in the south , sowing unrest among the border tribesmen in the thickly wooded Annamese highlands to the north . By day Saigon , a city of 2,000,000 , is safe enough . But no one willingly sets his foot outside town after dark . <P> <P> Fueled by Communist North Viet Nam with supplies and men smuggled through Laos over the clandestine Ho Chi Minh Trail , this wasting war has been going on for seven years . Its object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stubborn President Ngo Dinh Diem , 60 , who runs the war , the government , and everything else in South Viet Nam from a massive desk in his yellow stucco Freedom Palace in Saigon . President Diem had fought the Communists in his country long before World War II . At war 's end , he was arrested by them ; his brother was shot by them . He has stood in their way ever since . <P> <P> As he is acutely aware , the current guerrilla war might get worse before it gets better . Unlike Berlin , where the crisis so far has been only words , South Viet Nam is the arena of East-West confrontation where men are dying in large numbers . The struggle is savage . Just since January the dead on both sides total 2,500-roughly triple the total casualties of all eleven months of fighting in Laos .
