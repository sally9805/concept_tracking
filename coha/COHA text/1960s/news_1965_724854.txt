txt The British-Canadian-Nordic donations of almost $18 million to the United Nations seek to liquidate not only the U.N . ' s deficit but the whole controversy over past assessments for peacekeeping operations . The paralysis of the General Assembly during the last year has demonstrated that the United Nations can be destroyed , but certainly can not be strengthened by the effort to force a major power to pay for peacekeeping activities of which it has disapproved . Despite the legal validity of the American position , sustained by an advisory opinion of the World Court , the United States clearly can no longer count on a majority ? if it ever could  --  to support its effort under Article 19 to force the Soviet Union to pay its share of the U.N . ' s Congo and Mideast operations , or suffer the penalty of losing its General Assembly vote . The consensus now is that the Assembly must be put back into business for its twentieth session in September . There is not even a majority now , as in the past session , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reach a compromise . The most promising solutions have all involved proposals to avoid a showdown under Article 19 by meeting the U.N . ' s S1OS million deficit through voluntary contributions . The Soviet Union has indicated that it would make a " substantial " donation if this were done . But no Solomon has found a formula for the size or timing of this Russian payment that would prove at one and the same time  --  to Washington and Moscow respectively  --  that the Soviet Union in effect had paid its assessment for peacekeeping and that it had not . Britain 's initiative seeks to rescue the proposed U.N . " rescue fund " from this impasse . London hopes other nations will follow its example and that Moscow will contribute a sum approximately equal to the $21 million of peacekeeping arrears it will owe by September . If these voluntary contributions finance the bulk of the U.N . ' s peacekeeping deficit , the Assembly could then rescind its earlier mandatory assessments , which no longer would be needed . This solution will preserve the organization to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal . Many peacekeeping operations , including the Korean War and the current Cyprus operations , have been based on voluntary financing . Washington 's choices now are limited . One alternative is to wait and see whether Moscow contributes the full S21 million . The other and , under present circumstances , the wiser alternative is for the United States to follow the British lead with a contribution of $25 million or more without conditions . The President could announce at San Francisco this week that this country intends to support the United Nations regardless of what other countries do . To accept the fact that the Soviet Union will not contribute to certain past operations of which it disapproved is not an important loss of face  --  especially if its effect is to save the United Nations . What is important is that for the future the General Assembly resume its normal operations and that it retain its constitutional power to apportion the expenses of the organization among its members . Peacekeeping operations in the future will doubtless take many different forms , as they have in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be functioning and strong enough to institute them when they are needed  --  and to this end a more flexible United States approach on application of Article 19 can make a great contribution .
