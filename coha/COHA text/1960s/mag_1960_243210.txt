While Khrushchev was busy denouncing the U.S. in Austria , his subordinates in Moscow were acting as if some of their best friends were Americans . Almost 300 of the cream of Moscow society showed up for the U.S. embassy 's Fourth of July celebration . Among them : First Deputy Premier Anastas Mikoyan , Secretaries Frol Kozlov and Nikolai Ignatov . <P> So many people arrived for the party , including busloads of American tourists , that one old lady was prompted to remark : " Did President Eisenhower decide to come after all ? " Apart from the crowds , the little cakes and flowing Schaumwein , the big three sat on a circular veranda and held an impromptu press conference . In obvious reference to recent speculation that Mikoyan had been downgraded , one correspondent said to him : " It 's a very pleasant surprise to see you here , and everyone is commenting on the fact . " With heavy humor , Mikoyan replied : " Were you opposed to my coming ? " He spoke with all the confidence of his old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as chief of the government in Khrushchev 's absence . Asked if Russia had enough tankers to supply Cuba with oil , he answered : " The Soviet Union has enough tankers to supply not only Cuba with oil but if necessary the U.S. as well . " He bristled only once when a reporter wanted to know the distance from the Black Sea to Cuba : " I am not an information officer . " <P> After Kozlov put in a plug for peaceful coexistence and confirmed that U-2 Pilot Francis Powers would be given a public trial , the three strolled to the drawing room to listen to a visiting celebrity , Pianist Van Cliburn . As Cliburn launched into Liszt 's Twelfth Rhapsody , Mikoyan put a fatherly hand on the shoulder of U.S. Ambassador Llewellyn Thompson 's daughter Sherry . When Cliburn swung into some lively Russian songs , Mikoyan joined in the chorus . <P> In Moscow , where parties are judged by the quantity and quality of Russian officials who attend , the U.S. party was a smashing success . Some attributed it to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign that coexistence is still Soviet policy in spite of Khrushchev 's blustering . Said one Western observer : " It was as if the U-2 incident and the summit collapse had never happened . The descent from the summit seems to have halted at the halfway mark . "
