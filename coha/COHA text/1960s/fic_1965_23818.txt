There Were Pigeons in the Square A story by Everett Greenbaum There were pigeons in the square and they all had little whistles strapped to them and the square was filled with their music . Now this was something I had seen someplace or heard of or dreamed . I did n't know which . I was living at the Grand Metropol Hotel on lower Broadway right after the war . I had come from Buffalo to study to be a writer under the GI bill at NYU . This old hotel was within walking distance of Washington Square and very cheap . I needed a cheap place to live until I had gotten through that short but necessary period of struggle before you become rich and famous . Once the hotel had known greatness . Diamond Jim Brady had taken Miss Russell to parties there . I was told that Jim Fisk had been shot on the main marble staircase . All of this was easy to believe when you saw the darkening gilded plaster and mirrors in the lobby . To the unsmiling , unclean man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance . There was a sink in your room and down the hall the men 's and the women 's . There was a sort of zoning system . The second floor was students , the third wrestlers , the fourth refugee rabbis , and the fifth , Lesbians . I was onspeaking terms with a few of the students and one of the Lesbians . She had a Harley-Davidson motorcycle and would let me use it now and then . Each month the Gl-bill money would run out about ten days loo soon . Then there were two ways to eat . The first way was to put on a dark suit and pretend to be a guest at the Bar Mitzvah . There was always a Bar Mitzvah going on in the main ballroom . This was all right except that you had to dance with one or two tiresome Jewish girls who were very much like the ones my father in Buffalo had lined up for me before I had fled to New York to be a writer . The other way to eat was the free bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . You had to look like a guy who had really come in to buy a lot of whiskey and drink it . Not like a guy who was going to drink a sarsaparilla for a dime and eat like a pig from the free table . And one kept alive . / was so full of pickles and pickled tomatoes and herring that I had an acid condition . But there were pigeons in the square and they all had little whistles attached to them and the square was filled with music . 95 I figured this . I figured that if a whistle could be made to blow in such a tiny airstream , I could make a toy airplane with many such whistles on it . Then , when you swung it around your head on a string , the whistles , all different sizes , would play together beating against each other in harmonics . I would patent this idea , take it to one of the hundred toy companies at 200 Fifth Avenue and live on the royalties . This would get me through that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , famous , and loved for your works . There were pigeons in the square and they had little whistles . . . . I started by going to whistle stores . There were no whistle stores . The notion of the square seemed to come from my time in the islands not far from Japan during the war . So I tried oriental stores . I made a fool of myself in every Chinese and Japanese shop in New York . Finally at the last Chinese place on my list , I got some action . A little Chinese knew exactly what I wanted . Luckily he had a whole box of them . Bamboo whistles . Very good . Very valuable . I bought the whole box for five dollars . A real plunge . I clutched the box and rushed back to my room at the Metropol . They would n't whistle . Nothing I could do would make them whistle . In despair , I put them under the bed in the Greenbaum Memorial Alligator Bag and forgot them . It was n't until years later in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get that information , you had to ask a man who was both an antiquarian and a musician . John Scott Trotter knew . They were reeds from old Chinese saxophones . There were pigeons in the square . . . . The image persisted and so did I. I went into Flushing and Queens . I was learning the loneliness of creative pursuit . If anyone on the subway doing real things , anyone doing definite , regular things ? the girl on her way to her job filing credit cards with Italian names on them , or the man on his way to a kidney stone clinic  --  if any of these people were to ask me , " Where are you going ? " and if I were to say , " Looking for pigeon whistles , " they would put me right into Everett Greenbaum has done a lot of writing for TV and the movies , but this is his first published short story . With Hal Kanter he worked on the George Gobel show , and with Jim . Fritzell on the Mr. Peepers show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " the class with the other people on the subway who never got off but rode all day saying " son of a bitch " to the walls . After two weeks I had given up . I was thinking about chucking the whole thing . Getting out the alligator bag , throwing everything into it , and going back to Buffalo . Enough of fame and artistic triumph ! I had a visitor . My grimy window was open . A grimy New York pigeon landed on the sill and looked at me . He waited expectantly . I suppose he thought I had food . The rabbis on the fourth floor had been feeding them matzo . I put on a sort of rabbinical manner and smiled at him . This was before the days people discovered that pigeons are full of germs . So I smiled and I was rewarded with an inspiration . Pigeons ! There were pigeons in the square ! I was off to pigeon stores , pet shops . Once again the wall of blank faces . Fearful faces . " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alarm button under the hamster cage ? " One lady had patience and some advice . " Try the curator of birds at the Bronx Zoo , " she said . Vowing that if this did n't work out it would be the end of the whole matter , I borrowed the Harley-Davidson and headed for the Bronx Zoo . I did n't get lost , but there was trouble with the clutch . A Lesbian will ride the clutch on a Harley . The curator of birds was the nicest man who ever lived . He spoke quietly and had gray hair and glasses . You could imagine strange birds coming up to him and kissing his head . " Of course , " he said , " Korean pigeon whistles V ' 96 THERE WERE PIGEONS IN THE SQUARE Majuro . Majuro in the Marshalls . The interpreter and I shared a tent . He was from Harvard and highly respected . The gentle Korean prisoner cleaned our tent every day , made the beds and swept the hermit crabs down to the beach . He was telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them like birds . Later I learned that in his home there was a square and . . The curator of birds opened a drawer and took the whistles out . There were three or four of them . Made of polished hardwood , very thin , and the shape of flattened artichokes . " They strap on the back , " he said . " I tried them only once . Put one on the back of a pouter . The poor thing was so frightened , he flew into the side of the elephant house and broke his neck . " " Did it whistle ? " I asked , selfishly overlooking the dead bird . " Oh my , yes ! " he said . " Watch this . " He attached the whistle to a length of string and swung it around his head . The music was enchanting . " If you only knew how long I 've been looking for these , " I said . " Do you mind if . . . " I reached for the whistles . " Very old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't let you take them away . " Requesting tracing paper and a soft lead pencil , I sat for an hour at his desk and made tracings . The length of the tubes , the size and openings of the embouchures , the thickness of the material . I rushed to a hobby store and bought bamboo , balsa wood , and amberoid cement . Stuffing all of these things into the saddlebags of the Harley-Davidson , I raced back to the Grand Metropol . By midnight I had made two whistles . Great success ! The most delicate puff made them whistle . But I was living in a fool 's paradise . By mistake I picked up a red rubber eraser and blew on it . It whistled ! So did my pen knife and a roll of thread . The trouble was I was n't just blowing , I was whistling as if I were walking down the street whistling . I started over . Finally at two in the morning they began to work . I had been tilting the embouchures at the wrong angle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind . I mounted them on a balsa wood plane and attached it to a string . It worked ! In another hour I had painted it Air Force colors . I had to test it in a larger space . Three A. M. in the wide hall next to the elevators Iswung the thing . It shrieked ! It hummed ! I could make it moan or howl ! The elevator door opened . A short man in a wide hat paused in the act of buying the morning papers from the elevator operator . Three cents above the regular price . " What in hell is that , kid ? " " A whistling plane . " " Whereja get it ? " " Made it ! Invented it ! Just now ! " " All right , all right , " he said . " Gim me a minute now . " He took his hat off and rubbed his bald head , leaving smudges of newsprint . " Five hundred all right ? " " What ? " " Ten in the morning . I 'll give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . Ten ? " " Ten . Five hundred . " " All right . " It was n't easy to sleep . I shaved at nine so that I could deposit the five hundred in the Bowery Savings Bank . Then to sixty-five a month GI money I could add another sixty from the bank and get through the year nicely . The man did n't come at ten . I waited until one-thirty . Had I imagined him ? That was before the days people discovered that sniffing model airplane glue made dope fiends of little boys . Depressed and starving , I went down to the automat for brunch : oatmeal with as much cream and sugar as possible . I sat at a small table occupied by a man who looked as though he had already fallen down several times that day . He stared at the wall . " Son of a bitch ! " he said . I was sorry to hurt his feelings but moved to another table . I had problems of my own . The oatmeal made things look brighter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What about the original plan ? Two hundred Fifth Avenue was full of toy companies . I only needed to sell it to one of them . I ran back to my room and wrote myself a letter . It contained a drawing of the plane and a paragraph telling how it worked . Then I took this to the post office and mailed it to myself registered , I had read about this in Popular Mechanics magazine . As proof of the original art it was as good as a patent in the courts . Putting the plane in a shoebox , I was now ready for 200 Fifth . The first two floors were all doll people . No good . The first man on the third floor came out of his back office and listened to me . " Looks like a good idea , " he said , " but we 're cutting our line down to inflatable goods . If you come up with something in a rubber horsie , let me know . " I thanked him and went on to the next office . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Very likely there was a shortage of toy inventors . Why had n't I thought of inventing toys before ? Maybe I could think up something else after the whistling plane hit the market . A submarine maybe . For the bathtub . Elastic-band motor . Would n't rust . Make for nine cents , sell for seventy . Think up a nice line of submarines . Get to be a writer without starving . Nice life . No one would see me in the next five offices . Discouraging . Maybe the man from the elevator had been hit by a taxi just hard enough to be delayed a few hours . Maybe he was waiting for me now with the five hundred dollars . The secretary in the next office asked me to sign a paper . She said it was a release . " You mean that if I sign this and you decide to use it without my permission I ca n't sue or anything ? " I asked , outraged . " That 's the idea , " she said . I signed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to watch . " Let 's see what you got there , " he said . " Well , it takes a little bit of room , " I said , taking it out of the box . I caught myself . Why kill the sale with negative remarks ? " But this will do fine . " I smiled , looking around the crowded office . I swung the plane , holding it in just a bit . It had begun to hum nicely just as it rammed a a story by Everett Greenbaum , 97 lamp made from a large , fragile , and , I was sure , expensive vase . I was ruined ! No one spoke as I swept the parts into the shoebox . I nearly dropped everything . It was hard keeping the parts of the plane entirely separated from bits of lamp . made of plastic ? " said the son . " Yes , " I said . " Make it up again and send it to our engineers in Chicago , " the wholesaler said . " Did you sign a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . I was learning how to handle myself in the business world . Working all that night , I put two more whistles on the plane , doped and sanded it four times so that it was smooth as glass before I painted it silver and set it off with bright red decals . In the morning , I wrapped it carefully , packed it in excelsior , and sent it to Chicago , insured for thirty dollars . Now came the waiting ... much anxious checking of the mailboxes behind the desk at the hotel . Even though I stopped by ten times a day , the dirty man did n't lose patience with me . He had been impressed by my having received a registered letter . Then one day there was a letter from Chicago . It was from the toy company ! I did n't have too much blood at the time but what there was went to my feet . I could n't open the letter in the lobby . I went to my room , lay on the bed , and tore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place in their line for my idea at the moment . " Son of a bitch ! " I said . That was n't all . When I picked up the plane at the post office , it was smashed . " What about this ? " I asked the man . " Is it insured ? " he answered . It was . In two days I received a check for thirty dollars from the postal service . I repaired the plane . In a week it was on its way to another toy company with an out-of-town factory . On the return trip it was again crushed . Another thirty dollars . This happened eight times before I reached the last toy company on the top floor of 200 Fifth . I ate well right up until summer vacation . Then I returned to my father 's house in Buffalo . There were pigeons in the square and they were good to me that year .
