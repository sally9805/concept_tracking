A stormy old name out of Central America 's turbulent past was stirring new winds last week . From Venezuela , where he lives in exile teaching " History of Philosophy and Culture , " Juan Jos Arvalo , 57 , the anti-Yankee President of Guatemala from 1945 to 1951 , announced that he will return home next month to start building for the 1963 presidential elections . As he prepared his comeback , one of his old U.S.-baiting books-The Shark and the Sardines , published in 1956 - was raising hackles in the U.S. in a new printing hotly promoted by Castroites . <P> The book itself is the standard , dogeared list of U.S. " crimes " - some true , some partly true , others patently false-against its smaller neighbors over the past 150 years . It serves Castro 's purpose so well that he has had 150,000 copies printed in Spanish to be sold for 5 per copy . For whatever U.S. audience that could be reached , a New York Castro-phile named June Cobb translated it into English . U.S. publisher : Lyle Stuart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also served as treasurer of the New York branch of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee . <P> The harpoons for " Uncle Shark " may prove a current embarrassment for Arvalo , who now sings a less strident line and says he will not even take royalties from Castro . But his book was no momentary aberration . A self-styled " spiritual Socialist , " he blamed his country 's ills on the United Fruit Co. , which had immense holdings in Guatemala , accused the U.S. Government of backing the company 's " exploitations , " once expelled a U.S. ambassador who offended him . In office , though a devious administrator , he gave his country some freedoms it had not known under a previous long line of dictators . The one party he refused to legalize was the Communist-but he did nothing to restrain the Communist clique behind gullible Army Colonel Jacobo Arbenz , who succeeded him as President . <P> Though Arvalo has been out of the country since 1953 , his image is still compelling . President Miguel Ydigoras Fuentes , a conservative , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there are anti-Communist elements here that might object . " <P> To minimize criticism , Arvalo protests , " I am a Christian and an idealistic anti-Marxist . " He insists that " I am not anti-American . I oppose the American Government when it turns into a protector of American corporations . " He still fumes that the United Fruit Co. runs Guatemala , but promises that " we plan to maintain free enterprise in agriculture , industry , culture and commerce . " <P> As for Castro , says Arvalo , Communism will not work in Latin America or anywhere else . " You can see that by going over their record in Cuba . "
