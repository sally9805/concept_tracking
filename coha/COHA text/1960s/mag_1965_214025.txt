There apparently are still some people who think that the war in South Viet Nam is a civil war . To end that fiction , and to explain why it is stepping up its attack on North Viet Nam , the U.S. last week issued a 64-page White Paper replete with photographs , maps , charts and case histories to prove that the Communist Viet Cong are inspired , armed and controlled from the North . <P> Titled " Aggression from the North , " the report represents the distillation of some 3,000 pages of Saigon , CIA , Defense and State Department intelligence . It nails down earlier estimates of North Vietnamese infiltration ( TIME , Feb. 5 ) , making nonsense of the often-heard contention-previously pushed by the Administration itself-that punishing the North would not change the situation because the guerrillas in the South are self-sustaining . The report describes how Hanoi runs its show , and points up the quickened pace of Hanoi 's effort-an aggression " as real as that of an invading army . " Key points : <P> THE MEN . Viet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with 60,000-80,000 local , part-time guerrillas backing them up . Moreover , since 1959 at least 20,000 and perhaps as many as 37,000 infiltrators have entered South Viet Nam from the North . Thus the report 's conclusion : " Infiltrators from the North-allowing for casualties-make up the majority , and probably the overwhelming proportion , of the so-called hard-core Viet Cong . " <P> Previously , infiltrators from the North , sent down via the Ho Chi Minh Trail , were mostly drawn from 90,000 Southerners who had moved North after Viet Nam 's partition in 1954 and had been trained by the Communists . These are now either too old for the tough guerrilla life or have been used up in the war to date . Thus most of the new arrivals from Hanoi are young North Vietnamese draftees . Of the 7,400 Viet Cong who entered the South last year , fully 75% were natives of North Viet Nam . <P> THE ARMS . With the stepped-up pace of the war , the Viet Cong can no longer rely on captured U.S. weapons . " Hanoi has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Communist-produced weapons . " Among them : a " new family " of Chinese Communist 7.62-mm. carbines , assault rifles and light machine guns , as well as heavier recoilless rifles , mortars , antitank mines , grenade launchers and bazookas . Whole Viet Cong companies have been outfitted with these new arms . The ominous conclusion : Viet Cong reliance on weapons that require ammo and parts from outside " indicates the growing confidence of Hanoi in the effectiveness of their supply lines to the South .
