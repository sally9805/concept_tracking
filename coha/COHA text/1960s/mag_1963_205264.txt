The ugly war in South Viet Nam seems to be dragging on forever , and Senator Richard Russell , chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , thinks he knows the reason why . Said the Georgia Democrat : " We are trying to fight this problem as if it were a tournament of roses . I think it is time for the dirty-tricks department to take over there . We are dealing with a bunch of scoundrels , and it seems to me we ought to catch them as if we were trying to run down Jesse James-$10,000. dead or alive . " <P> Actually , the Viet Cong should come cheaper , according to Russell , who proposed a system of rewards for peasants who reported Communist hideouts . Said he : " We might promise them a couple of water buffalo , or a new wife , or some money , or three or four acres of rice land - almost anything would be cheaper than what we are doing .
