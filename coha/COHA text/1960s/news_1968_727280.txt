txt Bernard Cardinal Alfrink and the six other Roman Catholic bishops of the Netherlands have said in a joint letter that there are many factors besides the papal encyclical on birth control that Roman Catholics will consider in their approach to family planning matters . Calling attention to the fact that the papal announcement is not infallible dogma , the bishops said : " The personal conscience can not pass over an authoritative pronouncement such as a papal letter . " Sent to All Priests " There are , however , already many factors which determine one 's personal conscience regarding marriage rules ? for example , the mutual love , the relations in a family and the social circumstances , " the bishops added . The letter was written to all Roman Catholic priests in the Netherlands to give them some guidance for their sermons on Sunday , In the last five years Roman Catholic priests in the Netherlands , some members of the hierarchy among them , as well as almost all Catholic publications , have repeatedly stated that the decision on whether to use contraceptives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could judge all the circumstances . There have been no surveys on how the faithful approach the problem , but the impression of physicians who have been quoted in the last year is that about half of the Catholic population uses some sort of birth-control method , of whom half use contraceptives and half the rhythm method . The text of the bishops ' letter was not officially published , but it appeared today in the leading Roman Catholic daily , De Volkskrant . In an editorial , De Volkskrant commented that the passage on the authority within the church was a most remarkable one . " The college of bishops could hardly have found a more frank way to make clear that it is piqued by the method which the church has used to declare its decision in such an important matter , " the editorial said . One Criterion Among Several The newspaper also commented that the bishops had reduced the papal letter in value by placing it as one among , various considerations that guide the personal conscience . The bishops ' letter came as part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " Of Human Life " ) , issued Monday , which ruled out all artificial means of birth control as incompatible with human dignity and natural law . Though not immutable dogma , the encyclical is considered by the Vatican to be binding on Roman Catholics . Almost at once a group of 87 Roman Catholic theologians in the United States issued a strong dissent , and they have since been joined by 85 others . Yesterday , a Swisss Roman Catholic theologian , the Rev. Hans Kling , said in West Germany that the papal pronouncement not only was not infallible but also was wrong . The Roman Catholic bishops of the United States have called on both the clergy and the laity to heed the Pontiff 's encyclical , and the Vatican newspaper , L'Osservatore Romano , has reported hundreds of messages of loyalty and approval in addition to expressions of dissent . ' Many Are Disappointed ' The opening statement of the Dutch bishops ' letter said : " In this critical hour we realize that there is unrest among many Roman Catholics . Many are disappointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on contraceptives . " The bishops went on to comment that the letter calls for further study and that , therefore , they can give only a provisional reaction now . They continued : " A Roman Catholic owes respect to the authority and the pronouncements of the Pope . The personal conscience can not pass over an authoritative pronouncement such as a papal letter . " There are , however , already many factors which determine one 's personal conscience regarding marriage rules , for example , the mutual love , the relations in a family and the social circumstances . " We Roman Catholics believe in the infallibility of the Pope . Although this papal letter Is not an infallible , dogmatic statement , it nevertheless is a real defense of the dignity of life as well as an appeal for responsibility in sexual relationships and marriage that is of the utmost importance to our society . " May the discussion on the papal letter contribute to a better and better functioning of authority within the church . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
