One Chicago chain advertises beef steaks and roasts at the lowest prices in two years . ? ? ? CORN HARVESTING hits some snags . The crop is estimated at a record of nearly 4.4 billion bushels , but farmers need dry weather in order to bring it all in . Rain and snow delay work in some areas , while many hold off harvesting in the hope a hard freeze will dry the corn and improve its keeping quality . Iowa farmers had only one-third of their corn picked by early November , half the usual progress . ? ? ? PEAR PRICES promise to hold high this winter . The 1960 pear harvest was the smallest since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The crop in Washington , a major producer . was only about half the long term average .
