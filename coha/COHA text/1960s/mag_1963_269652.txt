For eleven weeks a campaign of terror has rocked the French Canadian province of Quebec , and sent shock waves rippling all across Canada . Last month a bomb ex plosion killed the night watchman at a Montreal army recruiting center . A fortnight ago , 13 time bombs were found in mailboxes in a Montreal suburb , and a Canadian army explosives expert was critically injured when one of them went off in his face . Last week 18 more sticks of dynamite were found planted in mailboxes in Quebec City , and an explosion shattered offices at the Montreal armory of the Royal Canadian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers . <P> Bombs may be common in the southern part of the Western Hemisphere , but what was going on in peaceful Canada ? Near some of the bombsites appeared the signature FLQ , meaning Front de Liberation Quebecois . The Front is a lunatic fringe of violent nationalists whose aim is the secession of French-speaking Quebec from the rest of English-speaking Canada . Estimates of its strength run from a handful to a few score-and so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But neither Quebec 's Premier Jean Lesage nor the federal government of Prime Minister Lester Pearson dismisses the FLQ lightly . For behind the bombs and bombast lie deep-rooted grievances that affect all of French Canada 's 5,500,000 citizens . The vast majority of them do not want to be separate . But they do want to be equal . <P> Second Class . Ever since colonial days , Quebec 's French-speaking population has bitterly resented traditional British domination of Canada 's economy and government . In 1867 , when Canada won self-rule , the fathers of Canadian confederation wrote into the British North America Act Quebec 's inalienable right to its own language , Roman Catholic religion and cultural identity . Just the same , Quebec 's citizens believe that their status is still second-class . Partly , French Canadians can blame themselves . For nearly two decades , Quebec was ruled as the personal fief of Premier Maurice Duplessis , who held the province in corrupt , paternalistic thrall . Only after he died could French Canada see clearly where it stood in relation to the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next door , English-speaking Ontario had become the economic heart of Canada while Quebec remained less developed , its natural resources controlled by outsiders . Moreover , while French Canadians comprised nearly 30% of Canada 's population , they held only 13% of the responsible jobs in civil service . They found that although Canada was officially bilingual , French was a working language only in Quebec-a manifestation of what Quebec Natural Resources Minister Rene Levesque calls " the Kenya colonist outlook . " He adds : " There are already people asking why the English have so many rights and privileges in Quebec when the French do n't have them elsewhere . " <P> Bon Mot . One of the principal elsewheres is the federal capital of Ottawa , where a French-speaking civil servant who receives a letter in French must send it to a translation bureau to be put into English . Even French-speaking civil servants are required to communicate with each other in English ; it simplifies filing .                    @
