Rumanians were once among Europe 's most irreverent and uninhibited people . Before World War II , their interest in sex and diverse erotica was legendary . But since the Communists took over , they have imposed so strait-laced a morality that only recently was kissing permitted in Rumanian motion pictures . <P> Such contrast is typical of Rumania , reports TIME Correspondent James Bell after a visit to Russia 's most contradictory satellite . Rising from a low base , Rumania 's industrial growth is the highest in Europe ( 16% ) , but its people are among the lowest paid ( $135 per year ) . Foreign businessmen fighting for fat government contracts find that waiters in Bucharest restaurants still prefer to be tipped in Western cigarettes ; in every hotel lobby there is a government office that offers on-the-spot payment for " articles made of chrome or nickel , cameras , radio sets , nylons , pearls , etc .

Supermarkets have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 15,000 , but eggs still cost $2 a dozen . <P> Natural Resources . Rumanian industry is booming because not even incompetent management can fail to make something of the country 's impressive natural resources . From the Ploesti oilfields pour 11.5 million tons of crude oil annually ; steel production hit 2.3 million tons last year . But little of this prosperity reaches the people because the regime is more intent on shining up the country 's industrial image than on improving the lot of the masses . <P> Though Walachian peasants drive teams of oxen before single-bladed plows , the government last year exported 25,000 desperately needed tractors ( total foreign trade was up 17% ) . Agricultural collectivization is such a primitive mess that grain production last year was 700,000 tons below the target of 11.3 million . The production of consumer goods has low priority as against heavy machinery . Food prices are prohibitive ; beef is only available on four major holidays and costs $1.50 per lb .

Though Dej has only reluctantly subscribed to Khrushchev 's anti-Stalinism , he is perhaps the most firmly entrenched of all the Iron Curtain satellite leaders . Despite Khrushchev 's tirades against the cult of personality , it flourishes in Rumania . Dej 's picture still hangs in every village , and his daughter Lica is Rumania 's highest-paid film actress-though she is homely and can not act . Lica 's first husband was fired as Minister of Commerce after she divorced him ; her second is now a top bureaucrat . Dej and other top government officials make up a " New Class " far beyond what Milovan Djilas described in Yugoslavia . The chosen few are chauffeured around in limousines , live in servant-crammed villas where they have private showings of the latest ballets , and are supplied with the best in wine , food and women .                  @ @ @
