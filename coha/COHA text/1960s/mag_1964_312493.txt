I was not prepared for it , but now I see it ! <P> But your notions mock Aristotle , doctor . They do not confide entirely in the reason , They default on sense , on the rational assurance . <P> This grabber is the lead-off speech of Lawrence Durrell 's new play , An Irish Faustus , which is playing at Hamburg 's Deutsches Schauspielhaus . <P> Hamburg has been patient with Durrell . His first play , Sappho ( TIME , Sept. 8 , 1961 ) , opened there and ran for all of twelve performances . But Hamburg 's theater-minded populace just could not believe that the author of vitally dramatic novels could write twice like a wooden Indian . So Durrell 's second play , Act is , was staged there too . It lasted 26 performances . <P> Incredibly , Hamburg has given Durrell another chance to work toward his announced objective : " To find out if it 's possible to write a poetic drama that 's really stageable and exciting . " His chief postulate apparently is that if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An Irish Faustus confides little to the reason and unintentionally mocks a great deal more than Aristotle . Durrell describes it as " a morality , " but it is really a pretension . Durrell himself was hooted from the stage at the end . <P> Shots &; Sketches . The hero is a boy scout Faustus who has voluntarily put aside his all-powerful magic ring of alchemized gold . But he happens to be working as a tutor to the Princess Margaret in the Irish castle of the lusty Queen Katherine . The Queen has become ravenous with desire for her dead husband , who has turned into a vampire . She arranges the theft of Faustus ' ring and vamps the vampire , turning him back temporarily into human flesh . <P> Mephistopheles shows up , dressed almost exactly like Faustus , indicating to the slow-witted that good and evil are close kin . They plot to recover the ring - Mephistopheles wants Faustus to be vastly powerful ; Faustus wants to prevent the ring from being used with disastrous results to mankind . For those who miss this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of old alchemy labs . <P> No End . Meanwhile , the earthy queen is in a state of sexual shell shock , as who would n't be after making love to a part-time vampire ? Faustus has the vampire put to death by impalement and recovers his ring . Then master alchemists appear before him ( old Ben Jonson characters like Linus Pauling ) to urge that he destroy the ring and save the world . He does-by plunging with it into the fires of Hell , where he ends up playing cards with the Devil . <P> Hamburg never gives up . A Schauspielhaus official sighed perplexedly and said : " Perhaps we should encourage Durrell to write a comedy next time . "
