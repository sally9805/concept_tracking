To the White House last week went diplomats from 21 hemisphere nations for a little chat with President Johnson about the Alliance for Progress . They departed wondering why anyone had ever doubted L.B.J. 's consuming interest in the Alianza . <P> In three hours of zippity-do-dah , he promised-without quite saying how- " twice as much action , twice as much accomplishment " in the next year , reported that loans ( $430 million since December ) were already flowing at almost twice the year-ago rate , personally signed twelve new loans worth $46 million . After the formalities , Johnson conducted his guests into the Cabinet Room for tea and another demonstration of maximum effort . When an ambassador wondered why Congress was holding up a U.S. appropriation to the World Bank 's International Development Association , Johnson grabbed a phone to call White House Legislative Aide Larry O'Brien : " What 's going on with fhe IDA bill ? How many votes have we got ? " Said Johnson , turning to the diplomats : " There 's been a lot of talk about ideals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideals into action . " <P> Next day the House passed the $312 million IDA bill , and L.B.J. gave the Latinos something else to cheer about . Into Teodoro Moscoso 's old job as U.S. representative to the Inter-American Committee ( CIAP ) , which guides the Alianza , went Walt Whitman Rostow , 47 , chairman of the State Department Policy Planning Council and a man with both the prestige and power to cut through the Alianza 's bureaucratic underbrush . The total performance left Peru 's Ambassador Celso Pastor bedazzled . " This marks the beginning of a new era , " he said . Or as one Administration adviser put it : " Latin Americans are learning that corn pone can be as nourishing as crepes suzette. "
