txt Some 150 members of Congress have signed a letter urging the Justice Department to act with " dispatch " on a special House committee report charging wrongdoing by Adam Clayton Powell . The letter said the committee found that Mr. Powell " did in five separate instances wrongfully and willfully appropriate public funds for his own use , falsely certify transportation vouchers from public funds and make false reports on expenditures of foreign exchange currency . " The move by the 150 members of the House was apparently designed to encourage the Justice Department to act before a special election is held in New York on April ' 11 to fill Mr. Powell 's seat , vacated when the House voted to exclude him on March 1 . March Is Called Off ' There was no immediate corninent ? on the letter from Attorhey General Ramsey Clark . ' ( In New York , a group of Harlem leaders : ; decided to ' postpone indefinitely a largescale par* planned for ; Sunday in honor Of Mr. ? Powell . The letter to the Attorney General , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ' the " Committee report has come to your special attention . " Copies of the report had been I sent to the Justice Department ' by the House committee . The letter was drafted by Representatives H. IL Gross , Republican of Iowa ; Alton Lennon , Democrat of North Carolina , and Durward G. Hall , Republican of Missouri . The special committee report , fin Mr. Powell was made public ) several days before the House Voted to exclude him from the 80th Congress .. In making public its findings , the committee recommended that Mr. Powell be censured by the Speaker of the House , be assessed $40,000 , and be dropped to the lowest level of seniority . The report charged that Mr. Powell had misused public funds by drawing a salary for his wife in : violation of House rules , ? , and had usei ? these funds for travel expenses of members . of his perSonal staff . ? ? The committee sent its records and:reports to the Justice Department for " prompt and appropriate action , " and requested that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee made known its recommendations , the House , ignoring the wishes of its leaders , voted overwhelminglyiy exclude Powell . 71. , addition to ? Seelting re ? eleetkii'in Harlem , Mr. Powell has ' ailed ' suit in , , Yederal . Court here to recover his lost seat . , Legal experts , ; have said that the suit has raised for the.first time , the ' possibility a ' possibilty a direct conflict , between the legislative . : and ' judicial branches a " ethe highest level the ' ? Federal Government . An irginnentthat is expected to figure in the suit is one that members of the House can not be sued for their action in barring Mr. Powell because of an 86-year-old decision with roots in the 17th Century political ferment of England . A Precedent in 1881 ' Speaker John W. McCormack and , other House . leaders ? must answer the suit by March 31 , on paper , and be prepared to argue preliminary points on April 4 . One precedent they are reported prepared to use is Kilbourn v. Thompson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitutional basis of the line of precedents is Article I , Section 6 : " . . . for any speech or debate in either House , they members shall not be questioned in any other place . " " Speech or Debate , " as the clause has come to be identified , has been extended by interpretation to include decisions deriving from such speech and debate . Hallet Kilbourn , thrown in jail by the House seargent-atarms , John G. Thompson , on a warrant signed by the Speaker of the House charging contempt , sued Mr. Thompson , the Speaker and other members for damages . The Supreme Court said : " The House of Representatives is not an ordinary tribunal . The defendants set up the protection of the Constitution , under which they do business as part of the Congress of the United States . " 1 Recalls English View ? The court then quoted the Speech or Debate Clause ' and , for historical support of its interpretation , went back to the 17th century : " The freedom from arrest and freedom of speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contest between the Tudor and Stuart kings and the ? House of Commons . When , however , ' the Revolution of 1688 expelled the last of the Stuarts and introduced a new dynasty , many ' of these questions were settled by a Bill of , Rights , for ' mally declared by , the Parlia. ment and assented to by the Crown . ( 1 William &; Mary , 2 , Statute , Ch. 2 ) . One of these declarations is that ' the freedom of speech , and debates , and proceedings in Parliament , ought not to be impeached in any court or place out of Parliamat . ' " The court , after reviewing an English test of that provision , said : " Many of the colonies , which afterwards became states in our union , had similar provisions in their charter or in bills of rights , which were part of their fundamental laws , and the general idefein all of them , however expressed , must have been the same , and must have been in the minds of the members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up by those of the defendants who were members of the House is a good defense .. . " The immunity , however , did not extend to Mr. Thompson , the sergeant-at-arms , who executed the Speaker 's warrant , and the case against him was sent back for further proceedings in the court below . The Supreme Court records do not show what eventually happened to Mr. Thompson , whose counterpart in the Powell case is Zeake W. Johnson , the House sergeant-at-arms . The rule in the Kilbourn case was eventually extended to members of state Legislatures , yet last December , in an apparent conflict with the Kilbourn ' case , the Supreme ' Court accepted a case involving the Georgia Legislature . It held that the Legislature had unlawfully denied a seat to Julian Bond . Mr. Powell 's lawyers have already indicated they will rely heavily on the Bond case . There , however , Mr. Bond 's Constitutional right of free speech was found to have been denied him . In the Powell case , exclusion Is not the result of Mr. Powell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his alleged misuse of House funds . He accuses the House of excluding him for reasons not enumerated in the Constitution 's qualifications for office : 25 years of age , seven years a citizen , and an inhabitant of the state where elected .
