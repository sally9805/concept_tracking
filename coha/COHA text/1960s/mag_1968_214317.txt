In Dar es Salaam 's sprawling Kariakoo market , a screaming mob halted buses and dragged off African girls wearing tight dresses or miniskirts . The girls were beaten and some had their clothes ripped off . With fine impartiality , the mob also beat up youths wearing tight-fitting satiny pants . It was " cultural revolution , " African style . <P> As an unabashed admirer of Mao Tsetung , President Julius Nyerere has decreed that Tanzania shall copy Mao 's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution , with its rejection of all things foreign . As their first order of revolutionary business , Nyerere 's " green guards " ( so called for the color of their uniforms ) set out to do away with miniskirts . <P> Get Lost . It was an unhappy choice . Unlike their Chinese counterparts , Tanzania 's style-conscious girls are staging a vigorous cultural counterrevolution . At the University of Dar es Salaam , a group of youths paraded placards declaring " Minis for Decadent Europe . " In retaliation , coeds donned their shortest minis and routed the green guards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a youth hostel unanimously voted that " men should not decide what women will wear . " One secretary defended her mini , explaining that it made it easier for her to move around the office and push through a crowded bus . A women 's leader , who is also a Member of Parliament , backed up the miniskirted girls , assuring them that " you can go naked-we wo n't object . " <P> Nonetheless , the Tanzanian Youth League is determined to press on with its " Operation Vijana ( Youth ) , " and so is 46-year-old President Nyerere . " It is foolish to wear clothes that show legs , " he declared last week . " It would be better for people to go unclothed if their intention is to expose their legs . " The Youth League has also called for a ban , as of Jan. 1 , on everything symbolizing the " cultural enslavement of the African . " Besides miniskirts , the ban includes wigs , tight pants for men or women , and chemicals used to bleach skins and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lipsticks and other cosmetics have already been condemned . Beauty contests , the " exploitation of female flesh , " are taboo . Green-guard girls wear thick skirts well below their knees . <P> In their zeal , Tanzanians have turned up some curious threats to their cultural independence , and sparked a lively debate . Football , declared one letter to an editor , is " a degrading product of colonialism and elite European boarding schools . African culture never produced such a clownish performance . " On the other side , an upholder of law and order wrote that " the Wall Street mob of American society that watched a busty woman is more desirable than the unruly mob that besieged terrified girls in the Kariakoo market . " <P> For the elders , President Nyerere 's sackcloth socialism has produced an official austerity seldom matched in Africa . Members of Parliament are forbidden to own shares in businesses , can not be corporate directors , and must forfeit their salary of $160 a week if they have any outside income . Only beer is served at government receptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a wa-benzi , or the owner of a big car like a Mercedes-Benz .
