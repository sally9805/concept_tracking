The Chicken-God A story by Yevgeni Yevtushenko Translated by David Mann Achicken-god is a little sea-stone with a hole in it . The Crimean Tatars believed that if you run a thread through the hole and hang the stone on your chicken roost , your hens will lay better . That is why they called the stone a chicken-god . Later , it was held that a chicken-god will also bring good luck . It seems that nearly everyone believes in lucky pieces , even if only a little bit . Some believe with childlike , undefended candor ; others believe in secret , with a morose intensity . I believe in secret . Whenever I was at the sea coast , I always wanted to find a chicken-god , but especially last summer . I gazed with unconcealed envy at the stout wrestlers ' necks of the boys , and at the girls ' slender , tressed necks , all hung with strings on which , like a medallion of the sea , faithfully swung the unpretentious stone . A string with its stone even hung from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perched with dignity on thebalustrade across from the resort dining room , sold dogwood walking sticks . On the beach right next to me , a fashionable , monumental woman , who always restrained herself in a manner worthy of her fashionableness and monumentality , squealed suddenly like a little girl , " Oy , comrades ! I 've found a chicken-god ! " She ran triumphantly to show the whole beach and , having done that , she lay down under her Chinese parasol and began obsequiously to kiss her grayish hope for luck , repeating over and over , " Ah , you , my chicken-god , my darling ! What a good one you are , to turn up I Are n't you the prettiest one , ah ? " A famous homeopath , lying beside me with an obscenely scorched nose , muttered through clenched teeth , " She 's cackling . . . . Now , for all we know , she 'll lay an egg . " But I knew that he had no chicken-god , himself . He envied her . The next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I walked very far , toward Serdolikov Bay . I walked along the bank , gazing with dull concentration in front of my feet . Two browned boys passed by , in velveteen shorts and with the wispy beards of " angry young men . " They were discussing life . " So what is your Picasso ! Salvador Dali puts out abstracts that Picasso never dreamed of . " " All right , enough about abstractions . Seen the new one from the girls ' academy ? What do you suppose that bathing suit alone is worth ? And the configuration ? A copy of Brigitte Bardot . That 's no abstraction for you . " On one of them hung a chicken-god  --  with a silver chain , in fact . For some reason , that chain particularly annoyed me . Only the chain did not annoy me , obviously , but what was on it . " Hey , Salvador Dali 's no abstractionist , he 's a surrealist ! " I shouted after them . But my little revenge failed . They did not hear me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spotted a chicken-god . It was not gray , as they usually are , but transparent , with coral veins . The hole was exactly in the center . It was lying right in front of the white , ribbed toe of my basketball shoe . I bent over and picked it up , very carefully , as though fearing that the chicken-god would disintegrate at my touch . And I chuckled grimly . There was a hole , but not all the way through . The stone needed about a hundred more years , and maybe longer , before the hole wore all the way through and it became a chicken-god . Now it was only a half-god , pretending to be a god . I tossed it into the sea and , with the diligence worthy of lofty undertakings , I began to examine all the other pebbles lying nearby . After all , it always seems to us that the real can be found close to the half-real . And when we do not find it , we are sorry about that half-real one , which we so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandiloquent and dubious  --  like everything grandiloquent  --  arose in me as I scuffed the shore with the stubbornness of a silent maniac . And , of course , it occurred to me that the chicken half-god which I had found symbolized my own half-happiness . " Lose your watch , young man ? " came a solicitous voice . " I 've been watching , and you keep looking for something . . . . " Near me stood a tiny old woman , her eyes filled with sincere concern  --  very lively eyes . Around her hand was wrapped a bathing suit , still wet , and quite festively colored . " Yes ... my watch , " I replied for some reason . " Then let 's look for it together . Two eyes are better than one . And my eyes are good , believe you me . My dear , I already ought to go on pension at my age , but I keep on working . I 'm a weaver , from Trekhgorka , and we would n't begin to keep people on with bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where did you lose it , your watch ? " " Around here somewhere , " I answered vaguely . It was too late to take back what I had said . " Maybe it slipped under some stone , or into a crevice somewhere , " said the old woman , terribly pleased to be concerned for somebody and very gingerly turning over the stones with her little foot . " And what beauty , really  --  these pebbles and the sea both ! You , my dear , is this your first time at the seashore ? " " First time , " I lied . I somehow felt that it was the right thing to say . " Me , too ! " rejoiced the old woman . " We 're getting our first baptism , eh ? I 've lived so many years , seen so much , but I never got to the sea . They awarded me a vacation . At first they wanted to send me to Kislovodsk  --  said it was more fitting , at my age  --  but I told them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Give me a vacation at the seashore , or else die and I wo n't see it . ' The part about dying , of course , I only said that to impress them  --  I 'll outlive Party Committees , too ! .. Well , where did your watch disappear to , anyway ? " " Oh , let 's forget about it ! " said I , now thoroughly ashamed . " What do you mean , forget about it ? You young people do n't know how to value things , because you come by them too easily . " " Maybe somebody took it . " I now wanted to get out of this in any way possible . But it did not work . " It 's wrong to speak so of others , " said the old woman sternly . " Maybe your watch is lying right around here , and you go suggesting a thing like that . I came home once , missed my purse  --  and too thought it had been stolen , on the streetcar , or somewhere . But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was born in Siberia in 1933 , won international acclaim in 1961-62 for his stormy political poem. , " Babi Yar . " Often denounced by Soviet officialdom , he has nevertheless traveled widely , and his " Premature Autobiography " was published abroad in 1963 . " The Chicken-God " was suppressed in Moscow , and the translator David Mann discovered it in the Nee York Russian-language paper , " Novoye Russkaye Steno . " Mr. Mann is now studying at the University of Colorado . With that , they located me through the Lost and Found Bureau and returned everything , down to the last kopeck . Afterward , I was ashamed that I had thought about people that way .... Look , what a funny stone ! " The old woman picked up her find and showed me . In her sturdy hand lay a chicken-god . " That 's a chicken-god , " I said dejectedly . " It brings good luck . " " Really ? " beamed the old woman . " Perhaps it will bring luck to me , so I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Duska ? " " Who ? Romandin 's chief of the Technical Quality Department in our shop , and Duska 's a brigade leader . Duska was a pretty good girl before , but as soon as she made the papers , that was the finish . They gave her a medal , elected her deputy to the Regional Soviet  --  all justly deserved , of course . But it went to her head . Or maybe they turned her head for her . Conferences , all kinds of solemn meetings , and she forgot how to work . She 's always turning out rejects . And Romandin covers up for her  --  says you ca n't undermine authority . That 's wrong . At work , everybody 's equal , like under God .... Well , now , where is that damned watch of yours ? " To tell the truth , my watch was in my pocket . I always took it off when I went to the seashore , so that there would be no white spot afterward . I pulled it out furtively and , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore . She soon found it . " Well here it is , here ! I told you , you lost it , " she said with satisfaction , wiping the crystal . " Do n't lose it again . And if something disappears , never think badly of others , look around first . I 'm going to splash around some more . Oh , that sea , I just love it ! Too had , when I was young ; I never came . . . . " And the old woman began to mince her way down the path toward the water . Halfway , she stopped and inquired in a businesslike tone , " In other words , this chicken-god will help me with Romandin and Duska ? " " Definitely so , " I smiled . But the smile came out somehow sad , envious . Not that I envied her the chicken-god . I envied the old woman herself  --  her conviction that she knew everything , what to do and what not to do . But , a little bit , I envied her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on the bank and , rolling lazily from side to side , I began looking for my own luck among the scattered pebbles . It was not there . This was all rather amusing ; I am a fairly adult person , yet with the fanaticism of a child I had attached this deadly significance to whether or not I found some little stone . I decided to search under water . Putting on the snorkel mask and plunging my head beneath the surface , I swam along the shore for a long time . The rocks were wholly different under water . A rainbow phosphorescence came from them , and it seemed as though they even breathed slightly with their rounded sides . They even understood me , it seemed , and there was something apologetic about them , that they had no holes in them . From time to time , big fish swam by  --  which , by the way , I had never come across before , when I hunted them on purpose . I decided to get the spear gun , which I had left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was clearly not fated to find a chicken-god , either on land or in the sea . Now I no longer watched the bottom , but lay in wait for fish to appear , quietly paddling with my left hand and holding the spear gun in my right , at arm 's length , with the safety off . As though sensing the change in my intentions , the fish had vanished . Already I was silently cursing both the fish and myself , when I glimpsed a long colorful body waving above the ragged seaweed . The fish saw me also , and froze . I started to squeeze the trigger . Suddenly a pair of fat-calved , hairy legs crossed my line of fire . I kept my finger lightly on the trigger , for some reason vividly picturing how my harpoon , with a whistle , would slice into one of those appetizing calves . The swimmer dived , and I noticed that he was rummaging along the bottom as I had done not long before . It was the homeopath . " Aha , he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malicious pleasure , and swam for shore . Soon the homeopath lay down beside me. stretching himself blissfully and not suspecting to what danger his calves had just been exposed . " There 's a message for you at the post office about a call from Moscow , " he said , and added with a contrived tone of indifference , " and look what I have . . . " In his plump , stubby hand with its topaz ring lay a chicken-god . That was more than I could bear . I said , " Thank you , " although at that moment I wanted more than anything to tell him that all homeopaths are charlatans . ( For the sake of fairness , I should say that I do not believe that at all . ) I put away my underwater gear and started for the post office . Who could be calling me ? Mama ? Someone from work ? She ? I remembered her as people remember melodies . Basically , every person is a melody . There are people endowed with the astonishing gift of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their very lives . And there are people endowed with the no less astonishing talent for irritating with the tactlessness of the very fact of their existence . There are people who evoke valor with the tragedy of their inner melody , and valor 's one appropriate display  --  action . And others , with their opinionated bravura , who evoke indolence and inactivity or  --  what is far worse  --  activity more odious than simple indolence . There are requiem people , people whose very lives are hymns , fox-trot people , and bluegrass people . And a few who are a strange potpourri of pop music and classical , to an odd degree . I knew what kind of melody you were . . . . No matter what restaurant we were in , if there was an orchestra , you asked me to request " Solvejg . " Once , in the restaurant at the hippodrome , I sent the violinist some money and a note . The waiter brought the money and the note back to me . Ona story by Yevgeni Yevtushenko 67 watching you once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard , walking with wearily drooping head into a future alien to you , which never became your own , however much you desired it . I , no doubt , loved you even before that , but I was too self-esteeming to acknowledge it , even to myself . After all , there was that yard , into whose unknown depth you had inevitably to walk away from me each night . After all , when we met alone , no one had to know about it . More likely , everybody knew and only one person did not know . But when everybody knows , and only one person does not know , that is still a greater lie . Therefore I pretended to myself that I did not love you , pretended from self-defense . And you even convinced me of it , saying with a somberly perturbed smile , " Nice line .. . . " And then , that evening , you told me , " You know , Alyosha , you do n't have to do this . Let 's go pick up some girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing somewhere . That would be better for you . Right ? " the other side of the note , in a vain , boyish scrawl , was written , " I do n't trade in Grieg . " The violinist watched with amused contempt as I read his reply . Then he saw you beside me . Something in his face changed , at once . He played some other things ? " The Skylark , " " Freilich " ? but he watched you all the while . And , pushing away the ten-spot thrust at him by a once-famous weight lifter  --  a crooked-legged little man with the face of a fruit speculator who demanded " sumshing in honor of our Odessa " ? the violinist began to play " Solvejg . " A few days later we went into that restaurant again . Upon seeing you , the violinist remembered . And as we walked along the carpeted aisle looking for a table , that melody again stirred over you . If a melody has eyes  --  and they have them  --  then that melody has eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But more beautiful are eyes like yours : unafraid and sad . No doubt , I fell in love with you when I first saw them . I did not understand that then , but only quite recently , I telephoned , and we went over there . I wanted to appear independent ; I saved myself from dependency , not yet comprehending that such dependence is itself salvation . Into the taxi flitted a twenty-year-old , wide-eyed creature  --  very slender and very intoxicated with her own good looks . But the melody of that little voice , glibly greeting and somewhat falsely prattling that she had not had time to dress , that melody was pitiful beside your melody of majestic exhaustion . We drove up to your house . " Do you live in that house ? " asked the creature with an interest in which rang triumphantly the cruel superiority of youth . " Yes , " you answered , still not getting out of the cab . " Which window 's yours ? That one there ? A light 's on . Probably your children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got out of the cab and , still holding the door , you said , " Well , have fun .. .. All right ? " ? and you crossed the street toward your house . White snakes of a ground wind twined about your feet in narrow shoes , and they were so defenseless , those little shoes . And I understood that I had to defend you . And still I could not defend you . A. few days later , we were sitting together and drinking something at somebody 's house  --  you , your husband , and I. Your husband 's face , with its brushlike , clipped moustache , was taut and stiff . He loved you a great deal , and at the same time he hated you . He could not forgive you for what happened to you a few years ago . He had never talked with you about anything , your husband . And a fellow showed up who began talking with you for the first time . You loved not him , but the fact that he talked with you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He , that fellow , was afraid of what he aroused in you . He resembled an orator who fears the sacrificial readiness of the people who believe in his words , and who cravenly runs from them when they are already prepared to perish for those beautiful words . Your husband could not forgive you that . He was a silent one , and silent people seldom forget anything . While serving something or other  --  vegetables , I think  --  you inadvertently made some special movement in my direction , and he noticed it instantly . And you , like a bird shielding her young from danger with her wing ( you were not really afraid for yourself -- you could fear only for others ) , you began talking about that other fellow , whom you actually hardly knew . He got up without a word and struck you on the chin . His blow was well-placed ; he had been a boxer once . You dropped , falling against the ribs of the heat radiator . I could not hit him . I simply shoved him aside and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I walked along the dark streets and the cab drivers shied away , staring at you . Finally one good fellow came along and drove us to Sklifosovsky Hospital . I thought up some story about being attacked by bandits . They did not believe the story , but to them that made no difference . When they were putting the stitches in your torn lips , I sat and cried in the corridor from shame that I could not defend you . And you still went back to your husband . You again told me your bitter , " You do n't really have to do this .... " So I left for the coast . Can it still be you who is calling me ? I somehow feared that , but I feared more that it was not you calling , that the call was about you.it always seemed to me that something terrible might happen . On the porch of the building where the post office was located dozed a little girl of about eight , her fist under her cheek . From the fist peeked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It was a notice for me to await a telephone call from Moscow . The little girl started and , recognizing me , shook her head in reproach . " Where have you been ? I 've been looking and looking . . . . " The notice was for twelve midnight and there was a lot of time left . " Where are you going ? " asked the little girl . " Nowhere . " " Please take me nowhere along with you . " " All right . " So we started off , for nowhere . Wth this little girl , 1 had a special relationship . She lived in that town with her mother  --  a sickly , lonely woman of about thirty-five , with melancholy eyes that understood everything . Once this woman walked up to me and said simply and openly , " I do n't know anybody here , but it seems to me you are a good person . It 's hard for me to walk , and my little girl wants so much to go to the mountains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking hikes in the mountains . We were on the Karadaga , where instead of flowers we gathered wiry bushes which glistened as though covered with frost . And in the Dead Bay , where the ashen said rustled mysteriously as shadowy lizards scuttled across it . And at the grave of the last Russian symbolist , who strolled here sometimes with a plywood sketch-board , in sackcloth overalls and Roman sandals . On the grave , a cross had once been traced with rainbow-colored sea stones . At the very heart of the cross lay a large , sky-blue rock with a hole in it . " Even he has a chicken-god , " said I sadly . " And I have none . " " What 's a chicken-god ? " asked the girl . I told her about them . " You 'll have one , " the girl assured me . " You are good , and everybody that 's good has to be lucky . " 1 did not take issue with her over whether the good must be lucky , but I asked , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mama could tell that about you right away . And Mama understands who 's good and who 's bad . And I understand , too . " " How do you understand that , such a little girl ? " " Because I 'm only little on the outside . Inside , I 'm already big . " I smiled , but for the first time I looked at her closely . She had green eyes , resembling two large sea sprays , sharp teeth which were still growing , with spaces between them , flaxen hair bound without vanity into a ponytail , and slim , peeling legs with lilac-colored knees , from abrasions . She lowered her eyes and , stroking the rainbow-stone cross with her browned little hand , she inquired , " Are you always like this  --  alone ? " " Sometimes even worse . " " What do you mean , worse ? " " That 's when you 're not alone , but you might as well be alone . " She stopped her hand on the bluish chicken-god at the heart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be your wife ? " " But I 'm so old . " " You 're not old at all  --  you 're even younger than my mama , and nobody tells her that she 's old . And besides , since when is it wrong to love old people ? " " And do you love me ? " " Would I want to be your wife otherwise ? " " And what does it mean , in your opinion , to be a wife ? " " That 's to love a lot . " " And what does that mean ? " " That 's to make it so that you 're always happy . And so that you 're never alone , even when alone . " She looked at me and sighed , fully like a grownup . " You 're afraid they 'll laugh at us . But be your wife in secret . Nobody will even know about it . PP " But I love one woman , " said I , now just as serious as she . " She love you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she does , sometimes not . But that 's not really important . " " It 's not important to me , either , " said the girl . " I 'm going to love you , anyway . I 'll he your wife to myself . And , maybe , can I visit you in the mornings and clean house ? " " Sure . " " Only you be messier , or it wo n't be any fun . " " All right , I 'll be messier . " So she came every morning and , armed with a brush , cleaned house with arch concentration . Many vacationers chuckled over our friendship , the homeopath in particular . But the girl 's mama understood us . She was very ill , after all , and the very ill always understand more.a story by Yevgeni Yevtushenko 73 And now my little girlfriend and I were walking nowhere . " Is it she calling you ? " asked the girl . " Do n't know . It could be . " " Would you like it to be ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We sat down on some boulders that jutted above the slowly darkening evening sea . A gang of boys and girls in shorts , dinning gleefully , was passing us on the trail leading down toward the sea . They carried bundles of tiny , almost toy-sized logs and blue Air France bags from which stuck bottles of dry wine . Those two youths whom I had not quite trapped that morning in their ignorance of modern art , specifically of Salvador Dali , were haughtily lugging a gigantic pot , and the scent of marinated meat wafted from under its lid . This whole troop was headed by a smooth-shaven , sun-tanned academician  --  also in shorts . By his looks , you would say no more than fifty , although I think that he first married before World War I. But he broke away from his scientific surroundings ? " ionized " himself  --  grounded himself to earth , and was always in the company of youth . He had an enormous dacha on the shore of the sea . The dacha , like a temple to ionization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Writers ' Resort , The academician walked over to us and I saw a miniature transistor radio , tuned in on Turkey , hanging from his shoulder . Judging by the sounds from the radio , Turkey was rejoicing . " You 're together , as always , " said the academician , gallantly kissing the hand of the little girl , who of course accepted it as her due . " We , too , are together , as always . " And toward the company in shorts which he led , he made a vague gesture , a rather melancholy gesture , because of its vague ness . " Will you not grant us the honor of attending our shish kebab ? " he asked , addressing himself to me and the girl as a thoroughly cultured individual . And , still in a rather melancholy way , he recited : A shish kebab , adorned with moon and mountainous terrain No greater happiness exists , celestial or mundane ! " Thank you , " said the girl courteously , " but Alyosha is getting a call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the post office . " " I hope that the call is a good one . " The academician again kissed the little girl 's hand , turned toward his troop , who stood shifting impatiently from one foot to the other , and soon the sounds of jubilant Turkey vanished around a bend in the trail . I loved him , that academician . I understood this : that his entire surroundings were only a form of loneliness , simply not so noticeable to everyone . Then the girl , with those wise and mournful eyes , like her mother 's , said , " Why do n't you be his friend ? I 'm very sorry for him . He 's all alone , too . And since he 's not alone , he 's even more alone . " She had understood . She understood everything . The sea was darkening . Sometimes the clouds hunched convulsively , sometimes stretched out listlessly . One would run against another , making one huge cloud , or sometimes fall apart . And suddenly in that incessant fusion and disintegration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time very familiar  --  with wise , suffering eyes . This face also understood everything . I stared at it as though hypnotized , my fingers clutching the grass that twined through the cracks in the rocks . Then the face disappeared . I searched for it a long time with my eyes , and among the moving clouds the face reappeared  --  this time a woman 's , but with exactly the same eyes . It also understood everything . Then it became a man 's face , then again a wornan 's , but it was the same face  --  a face of magnificent , uni-double human goodness , which always understands everything . I felt both fear and delight . This continued in me long after it had become so dark around me that I could distinguish nothing in the clouds ' shifting features , even if there had been something there . " We better go to the post office , " said the girl . " Be twelve soon . " " You should go home . Mama 's probably worried . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you . " We started for the post office . Now I was some-how certain , it was you calling . But it was not you . Iheard the low , slightly hoarse voice of the rather strange and  --  because of that  --  even more amazing woman whom you used to call your adopted mother , although she was barely older than you . " She 's at my place now , " said the woman . " She 's sick , understand ? You 've got to come immediately . " " All right , " I replied . The little girl was waiting for me on the porch . " Was it her ? " " No , not her , but it might as well have been . I have to leave right away . And you go to bed . It 's late . And anyway , you 're not big on the inside , but on the outside ; and on the inside you 're still quite little . " " Can I come with you ?

" I took it very carefully , the way people take good fortune only when they understand what it signifies . The girl raised on her tiptoes , kissed me on the forehead with cold lips , and ran away . I awakened the director of the resort , said that my uncle had died , and within an hour I was speeding toward Simforopol in a passing car .

The toffee for some reason gave me hope . " My uncle has died , " I said happily . " Everybody 's uncles die , " responded the dispatcher . " But I loved my uncle very much .
