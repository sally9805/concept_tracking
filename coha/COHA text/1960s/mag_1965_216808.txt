Atlantans boast that their city is the most progressive and peaceful in all of the Deep South . In his four years as mayor , silver-haired Ivan Allen Jr . has given them plenty to boast about . No fewer than six of the seven civic programs for which Allen campaigned in 1961 have been successfully completed . <P> As a result , Atlanta has : public schools desegregated through all twelve grades ; an $18 million stadium home for its first major league baseball team , the Atlanta Braves ( who will move from Milwaukee at season 's end ) ; a $9,000,000 auditorium-exhibition hall complex ; a $14.5 million freeway link between the downtown area and the airport ( fifth busiest in the U.S. ) that cuts driving time 23 minutes ; 20,000 new jobs yearly since 1962 , which is double what Allen was shooting for and has given Atlanta the lowest unemployment rate of any major U.S. city . Only his dream of a rapid-transit system is still unfulfilled , but it is in the blueprint stage . <P> With such an impressive array @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who ran the South 's largest office-supply firm before he became mayor , was so confident of re-election this month that he even predicted his percentage of the vote : 72% . For a while , in fact , it looked as if Allen would get 100% . Until the last filing day for the election , he was the only mayoralty candidate . Then , five minutes before the deadline , in jumped Milton M. ( " Muggsy " ) Smith , 63 , an Atlanta insurance salesman who made a name during 16 years in the state legislature trying to repeal every segregation law in Georgia . But Muggsy , who had run against Allen in 1961 , never had a chance . <P> Last week 76,000 Atlantans ( less than half of the city 's 181,000 registered voters ) went to the polls , made Allen 's prediction of his winning percentage come close to true by handing him 70% of the vote-53,187 to Smith 's 21,153 . And despite Smith 's civil rights grandstanding , Allen won an overwhelming majority of the Negro vote . The small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was , mused former ( for 26 years ) Mayor William B. Hartsfield , " indicative of a satisfied citizenry. "
