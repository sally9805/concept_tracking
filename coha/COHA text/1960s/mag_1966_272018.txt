Cinerama 's Russian Adventure . " Who are the Russians ? What is Russia ? We could n't possibly supply answers to these questions , but we 're going to have a lot of fun trying , " drawls Narrator Bing Crosby , fingering a balalaika . Bing thus introduces this Russian-made travel triptych , a cultural exchange import aquiver with evidence that the Soviets lack Cinerama 's skill at matching seams . In Kinopanorama-an equivalent three-screen process-cities , rivers , mountains and ice floes all hump up at the center and slope away precipitously . <P> Otherwise , Russian Adventure ignores the seamy side of life east of Berlin 's Wall . The pace is " strong , steady and fast " in Moscow , where citizens enjoy sumptuous subways and cold winters . " But Russians say it 's a dry cold , " Crosby adds informatively . So much for insight into the Soviet character . While a multiple sound track booms musical punctuation , the movie visits several dazzling acts at the Moscow Circus , peeks at the shipboard dissection of a giant whale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moiseyev dancers and the Bolshoi Ballet . <P> Comedy relief is supplied by a wilderness fantasy in which big brown bears chase chickens , steal honey and drive off in tractors . As ever , Cinerama achieves its surest effects in direct relation to its forward velocity , now hurtling along a snowy course with a fleet of troikas pulled by frenzied horses , now navigating with loggers on the turbulent Tisza River . The viewer may not feel that he has been through Russia , but he will almost certainly feel that Russia has been through him .
