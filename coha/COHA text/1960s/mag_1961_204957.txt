On any given weekday , the 16-sky-scraper complex of Manhattan 's Rockefeller Center is likely to contain 38,000 office workers and 160,000 assorted shoppers , sightseers , and moviegoers at the Radio City Music Hall . Could those crowds survive the hazards of radiation if a nuclear bomb fell on New York ? Last week , deciding that the answer could be yes , Rockefeller Center , Inc. announced the start of a fallout shelter program that may well be the largest undertaking of its kind in the country . <P> In accordance with civil defense regulations , Rockefeller Center has had certain inside corridors and rooms marked off as shelter areas since 1950 . Now , with the help of an outside engineering firm ( Manhattan 's Guy B. Panero , Inc. ) , the center 's management is drastically revising its plans to prepare for both light fallout ( 3,000 roentgens or less ) , when 24-hour protection would suffice , and for heavy fallout ( 10,000 roentgens ) , which might require quarantine for two weeks or more . Preparing first for light fallout , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its buildings , has asked tenants ( including the Associated Press , TIME Inc. and the National Broadcasting Co. ) to help provide food , medical supplies and emergency lights for the shelters . <P> The center can easily be made safe from light fallout : a survey has already proved that the center 's water tanks-all located underground-are safe from radiation ; windows in the central control board room in the yo-story RCA building are being bricked up to preserve the center 's communications with its buildings . Next year the center will start on a far harder project-safeguarding underground shelters where workers and sightseers could wait out heavy fallout . Says Center President G. S. Eyssell : " We hope and pray that the thing we 're preparing for will never happen , but we must still prepare for it . "
