Hawaii has never been the same since a bald , rotund tourist wafted in on the trade winds for a vacation in 1954 . The tourist was Henry J. Kaiser , fresh from several careers as wartime shipbuilder , automaker , steelman and millionaire chief of a vast industrial empire . Vacationing with his second wife , Kaiser found hotel accommodations scarce on Honolulu 's crowded Waikiki Beach , rented a house near Diamond Head , and sat back to wonder who would house the hordes of mainlanders he felt sure would discover the island 's natural beauty and balmy climate . His predictable answer : Henry J. Kaiser . <P> <P> Thereupon Kaiser launched a new career as the biggest-and most controversial-booster and builder ever to hit Hawaii . He has already built about $50 million worth of hotels , hospitals , plants and housing developments and , at 78 , feels that he is only beginning . Last week Kaiser showed off the first houses in his most ambitious project : Hawaii Kai , a projected $350 million dream city on the eastern end of Oahu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maunalua Bay and Kuapa Fishpond . <P> Hawaii Kai , which Hawaiians call the " Pink Dream , " will eventually contain about 11,000 single-family houses-ranging from $25,000 to more than $45,000-for some 75,000 people . Plans call for 20 miles of man-made beach , schools , country clubs and marinas . Like all of Kaiser 's other Hawaii projects-including his hotels , his fleet of 200 vehicles , bulldozers and cranes , and his private navy of dredges-the houses in Hawaii Kai will feature Kaiser 's favorite color : shocking pink . His engineers say the job will take ten years , but Kaiser insists it will be five . <P> Cement &; Thatches . Kaiser started in a small way-for him . He bought $3,000,000 worth of land bordering on Waikiki , created his own beach and artificial lagoon , and started work on his Hawaiian Village Hotel . In short order , he built 70 thatch-roofed units , a million-dollar 100-room hotel , a 1,000-seat convention hall , a 14-story , 260-room Ocean Tower , an aluminum dome for the convention over flow , and a $1.5 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $5 million , 17-story hotels called the Diamond Head Towers , which will give the Hawaiian Village more rooms ( 1,600 ) than any other hotel in Hawaii . Kaiser plans to raise the total to 5,000 when business justifies it . Says he : " Conventions can equal the rest of the tourist business in Hawaii combined . " <P> <P> Kaiser is so bullish about Hawaii 's future that this year he opened a $13.5 million Permanente Cement plant with a capacity ( 1.7 million barrels annually ) just about equaling the present cement consumption of Hawaii . He is confident that new buildings will rise to use his cement , but his move got him into a feud with Hawaii 's powerful Dillingham family , which owns a share of a huge cement plant . Kaiser has also built the $4 million Kaiser Medical Center , the islands ' most modern hospital , has built two clinics and is planning a third to accommodate 40,000 members he has signed up in his own health plan . His other Hawaiian interests include a radio and TV station and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
