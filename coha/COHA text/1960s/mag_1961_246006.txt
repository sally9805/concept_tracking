The week 's other conference was not menaced by euphoric Chinese . <P> In Oslo , foreign ministers of NATO nations assembled in a gold-and-raspberry chamber of Oslo 's Parliament building for a critical look at the new U.S. Secretary of State and his program for Europe . <P> Holy Terrors . While Dean Rusk got a warm personal welcome , his policy proposals got a chilly reception . When he emphasized the U.S. desire for a NATO buildup of conventional forces , the delegates shifted restively . Britain clearly has no intention of restoring conscription . France remained silent about any planned redeployment of the 500,000 troops pinned down in Algeria . Small powers such as Norway argued that what is needed to defend Western Europe is not more troops but better conventional weapons . <P> Originally , the NATO military forces on the Continent were conceived as a shield to fend off the Red army while the U.S. wielded the " sword " - " massive re taliation " with the atomic bomb . But then the U.S. had a nuclear monopoly . Today , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage on the U.S. , the Western European nations want a clear statement of Washington 's intentions . France , as the most vocal , has wondered aloud if any U.S. President is prepared to sacrifice New York to save Paris . De Gaulle 's bootstrap effort to create his own bomb is largely designed to serve his vision of grandeur . But the justification he offers is that French towns will remain safe only if France has the power to retaliate against Russian towns . <P> To quiet their uneasiness , Rusk assured the foreign ministers that the U.S. " intended to keep its forces at full strength in NATO " ; these forces were equipped with a full array of tactical atomic weapons that could match anything the Russians could throw . The need for a boost in conventional forces was only so that NATO forces in Europe could answer " small fire alarms with something beside an all-out nuclear response . " <P> Rusk also produced a plan , echoing a suggestion made last December by then Secretary of State Christian Herter , that NATO take " control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so hedged with restrictions-the subs will continue to have U.S. crews and be under direct U.S. command-that Britain 's Foreign Secretary Lord Home was not aware precisely what Rusk was offering until he left the meeting and got a briefing from his own experts . The obscurity was deliberate , for the reality is that President Kennedy has not yet decided whether to equip NATO with its own nuclear arms and , if so , under what conditions . <P> On Berlin , Rusk was forceful . He said that the U.S. expected a new Russian-induced crisis over the West 's island in Communist East Germany this summer or fall . Weighing his words carefully , he declared that if the Russians threatened to sign a separate peace treaty with East Germany , " they should be left in no doubt that we consider such a treaty a violation of the legal situation in Berlin . " Any obstruction to Western access to Berlin , he made clear , will be countered with military force , if necessary .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
