From shipyards along the lower Tyne and Glasgow 's narrow Clyde came forth the proud ships that once ruled the waves . Until World War II , Great Britain built nearly half of the world 's vessels . But for at least a decade the British shipbuilding industry has been badly ailing : last year it launched 1,000,000 tons of merchant ships , less than in 1947 , while the Japanese alone produced six times that amount , carving out 47% of the total world production . <P> There are signs that the tide may be turning now , thanks in part to a $103.5 million government loan fund for modernization and $600 million in easy credit for British shipowners to buy British .

Two Esso tankers , 240,000 tons each , bigger than any ship ever built in Britain , will go up in their yards . Belfast 's Harland &; Wolff will build two more , at a price of $73 million for the four . <P> While industry mergers , possibly into four regional groups , will probably cut costs and afford greater efficiency , Sir John admits that things would n't be looking up " if the oil companies had not been held to ransom by Mr. Nasser .
