When he arrived last week in South Viet Nam , U.S. General Paul Donal Harkins , 57 , found familiar scenes . Saigon 's streets are thronged with U.S. soldiers clad in off-duty slacks and Hawaiian shirts . White-helmeted U.S. military police stroll in pairs past the bars and nightclubs of the Rue Catinat . In the high blue sky lie the geometric patterns of contrails from U.S. jets , and at Saigon 's busy docks , U.S. ships unload wheat , flour , trucks and military hardware-all the material needed to complete Harkins ' mission . <P> To newsmen , General Harkins crisply described that mission as " doing all we can to support the South Vietnamese efforts to eradicate the cancer of Communism . " Over the past five years , the U.S. has spent $2 billion to that end in South Viet Nam , but it has not been enough . Harkins ' appointment as commanding general of the newly created U.S. Military Assistance Command is the first step in a more broadly based anti-Communist campaign . With a staff of 200 , Harkins takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers ( soon to be boosted to 7,000 ) . His units range from war dogs for patrol duty to medical outfits to U.S. fleet units in the coastal waters , which will intercept saipans and junks bringing down men and supplies from Communist North Viet Nam . <P> Count or Kill ? Harkins will not only have to help South Viet Nam 's President Diem reform his regime ; he will have to do some reforming of U.S. operations as well . The first U.S. military mission in South Viet Nam dates from 1954 , when Lieut . General John ( " Iron Mike " ) O'Daniel helped organize the Vietnamese army for pro-Western President Ngo Dinh Diem . Next came Lieut . General Samuel ( " Hangin ' Sam " ) Williams , a leathery , irascible veteran who was convinced that when war came it would be a Korean-style invasion from the north with the Communists pouring tank columns and road-bound infantry divisions over the border . Williams was succeeded in 1960 by Lieut . General Lionel McGarr , who many critics think was too chairborne and conventional-minded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cong insurgents . During one briefing session with Presidential Emissary General Maxwell Taylor last year , McGarr gave a detailed report on the numbers of Viet Cong guerrillas infiltrating the Mekong delta region . Taylor reportedly grumbled : " Why do n't you kill ' em instead of counting ' em ? " <P> Harkins , a onetime cavalryman and deputy chief of staff in World War II to hard-driving General George Patton , was nicknamed " Ramrod " because it was his job to see that Patton 's orders were obeyed swiftly and efficiently . Boston-born , Harkins has a reputation for tact and diplomacy as well as drive and discipline , all of which he will need in the job ahead . The U.S. is committed to a three-stage " pacification " program in Viet Nam that calls for 1 ) anti-guerrilla training and military re-equipment of the Vietnamese army , 2 ) swift-moving offensive operations against the hard-to-find Viet Cong guerrillas , and 3 ) reconstruction of the nation 's staggering peasant economy .               @ @ @ @ @ @
