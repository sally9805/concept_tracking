txt A study of 19 automobile repair garages here has shown that only five accurately diagnosed a minor engine defect and that the repair cost estimates ranged from no charge to $40 . " Eleven garages-60 per cent of those surveyed  --  turned in completely false diagnoses , " the Citizens Committee for Metropolitan Affairs reported yesterday . Speaking at a press conference , William F. Haddad , president of the committee , said that its survey had shown " a shocking scarcity of welltrained mechanics " and " a desperate need for fair-price guidelines in automotive re // pairs . " The committee is a nonprofit civic organization formed in 1964 and composed of approximately 700 members . In the words of Mr. Haddad , they are " young professionals , Wall Street types . " Participation in the group , which is financed by assessments on the members and the 18-man board of directors , is strictly voluntary , and members are assigned to serve on one or more of its 18 subcommittees . In keeping with its policy of serving the public as an " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patronage practices and drug prices in New York State . The automotive survey was conducted by volunteers headed by Thomas Boyd , a returned Peace Corpsman who taught mechanics in India . Nineteen independent service areas were selected with standard market sampling techniques that correlate neighborhood income with population density . This selection method , according to the committee , gave a cross-section of garages that was " representative " of automotive repair centers for the entire state of New York . A 1966 Oldsmobile Vistacruiser station wagon , with 27 , - 000 miles on the speedometer , was selected as the test vehicle . Members of the test team were taught how to measure the distributor point setting and how to alter this setting from the manufacturer 's recommended specification of 30 degrees . Before entering each service station , a member of the sur-I vey would adjust the point setting to 42 degrees ; otherwise the car was said to be in " excellent condition . " The point setting regulates the firing of the spark plugs in the engine . According to Mr. Haddad , this particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produces ? a very rough engine , with loss of power and difficulty in starting ? should be recognized by " a kid in high school mechanics class " as being caused by an improper point setting . The survey reported , however , that most of the 19 mechanics consulted were inclined to recommend a full tune-up ? at prices ranging from $14 to $40 . In one instance the mechanic listened to a description of the car 's performance and , without leaving his desk to inspect the car , suggested : " Probably needs a tune-up ? $22.05 . " At another midtown garage on the East Side of Manhattan , a man who did not claim to be a mechanic but said he was " familiar " with the car , said : " Sounds like it needs a tuneup . If it has n't been tuned within 10,000 miles , you should have it done . " Cost : $35 . Other mechanics were apparently baffled by the problem . One , who worked at a lower East Side gas station checked the spark plug wires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readjusted them to nearly the same position said : " Must have been some dirt in the carburetor . " Only one mechanic of the five who correctly diagnosed the trouble correctly identified the problem immediately . He readjusted the points without charge . On the basis of these investigations , the report concluded that " except for the few cases of satisfactory service , the mechanics were not willing to waste their time on a $2 or $3 adjustment . " The report contended that mechanics were content to use a " cover-all diagnosis " of a tune-up even though , " in all but a couple of stops , the car 's engine was running so badly that an experienced man could not have failed to suspect improper ignition timing , which could have been corrected by a simple adjustment . " The report recommended that " the City of New York promulgate fair-price guidelines for automotive repairs and that procedures be established that will lead to certification and licensing of automotive mechanics in the New York City area . " Approaches have already been made to state legislators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss the possibility of legislation requiring the licensing of mechanics . Commenting at the press conference , Mr. Haddad said : " I think it the mechanic 's alleged incompetence has become a form of acceptable corruption . The public has been made to feel that it is normal to do business in this manner . " However , I 'm sure something is going to be done about it this time . "
