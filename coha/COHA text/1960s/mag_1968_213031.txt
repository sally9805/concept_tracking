West Germany 's leftist students idealize violence as a necessary weapon for revolution against what they consider their country 's corrupt and repressive society . After their leader , Rudi Dutschke , was badly wounded by a would-be assassin two weeks ago , the students staged violent and bloody demonstrations in virtually every major city . Last week , bruised and battered from police truncheons , they were having some second thoughts about the efficacy of violence . They had , in fact , found neither violence so romantic nor West German society so weak as they had imagined . <P> Dispersed &; Dismayed . Chancellor Kurt Kiesinger warned the students that violence would be met with counter-measures-and it was . In Berlin , Hamburg , Munich , Frankfurt and other German cities where demonstrators tried to blockade the regional printing plants of Publisher Axel Springer , whose papers are critical of the student leftists , police asked them to disperse , then went to work on them with bruising water cannon and truncheons . The students were not used to seeing their own blood flow , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from rioter-thrown missiles of Associated Press Photographer Klaus Frings , 32 , and Munich Student Ruediger Schreck , 27 . <P> To their dismay , the radicals found that the majority of West Germany 's 282,000 students , who had joined them in countless nonviolent protests in recent months , wanted to back out when physical violence , to others and to themselves , became the rule . In fact , in Munich , where the two riot deaths occurred , moderate students , carrying banners that read STONES ARE NO ARGUMENTS , demonstrated against the Socialist German Student League , which had stirred up the violence . Confronted with failure on all fronts , the radicals , who constitute a well-organized 10% of the West German student body , withdrew to plot a new approach . <P> " Matriculated Mob . " The man whom the radical students singled out as the symbol of all that is bad in West Germany is a tall , silver-haired publisher who commutes between his six homes in Europe in a private jet , directs his $200 million press empire from atop a glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 55 , is sternly antiCommunist , assertively German , and a strong supporter of the U.S. stand in Viet Nam . He owns 15 magazines and newspapers , including the popular Bild-Zeitung ( literally , picture paper ) , that account for 31% of West Germany 's circulation of weekday publications , 88% on Sundays . Reflecting the disdain that most West Germans feel toward the unkempt young radicals , Springer 's papers call them " political beatniks , " " crazy half-toughs , " and " the matriculated mob .
