No African nation boasts a more elegant capital or a more mellifluously named ruler than the Ivory Coast . President Flix Houphouet-Boigny dwells in a $12 million palace resplendent with 52 types of marble and an air-conditioned wine cellar . The French government spends $50 million a year in aid on its former colony in order to make Abidjan a showcase of French influence - but it remains a showcase for much else besides . At a hastily called meeting of foreign diplomats and government officials , the President last week revealed that he had come within a fork 's length of being assassinated by - of all things-juju . <P> From a suitcase H.B. produced two miniature coffins containing photographs of himself , some bottles of doubtful-looking potions , and other tools of the black magician 's trade . " For a Westerner , " he said , " all this may seem childish , but we are at the heart of a great drama being played in black Africa . These fetishes are the root of the problem , because behind each one there is poison . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been intended for his food , Houphouet reported , just in case the hexed coffins did not work . But the word got out ( witchmen are notorious gossips ) , and the perpetrator had already gone to his reward . He was Ernest Boka , 36 , until two weeks ago president of the Ivory Coast 's Supreme Court and the third man in line of succession behind Houphouet . Boka had confessed , Houphouet claimed , and then hanged himself by his pajama trousers in the prison shower . So does justice catch up with the juju man , Houphouet warned . <P> His scorn rang a trifle hollow . Although he possesses a medical degree from the University of Dakar , Houphouet has been known to consult the omens of juju himself before making decisions , and even his name has a special juju meaning . In his native Baoule dialect , Houphouet means " pit of excrement " -a phrase intended to scare off devils.
