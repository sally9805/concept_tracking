On his historic three-day trip to Israel and Jordan at the end of this week , Pope Paul VI plans to meet Athenagoras I , Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople and first among equals of the world 's Orthodox bishops . The encounter will be the first between a Pope and a Patriarch of Constantinople since the Council of Florence in 1439 , when the breach between the eastern and western branches of Christendom-then 400 years old-was momentarily healed . <P> " They will meet in a spirit of Christian fraternity , " said a Vatican official , meaning no more than that . After Paul announced , at the closing of the Vatican Council 's second session last month , that he intended to visit the Holy Land , the Patriarch suggested that the trip be turned into a " summit conference " of the world 's Christian leaders . The Vatican 's Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity responded by sending Father Pierre Duprey to Istanbul with a letter for Athenagoras explaining that Paul was going as a pilgrim to pray at Christian shrines , but also expressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friendship . <P> Duprey returned with the news that Athenagoras was eager for the meeting , although as spokesman for Orthodoxy he had first to get the approval of the other patriarchates and autocephalous churches . By last week Athenagoras felt that the consensus favored his going , dispatched two prelates to the Vatican to work out final details of the encounter . <P> " Too Dramatic . " The two churchmen will meet on the morning of Jan. 6-a date celebrated by both Rome and most of Orthodoxy as the Feast of the Epiphany . The site , proposed by the Vatican , will be the residence of the apostolic delegate in Jordanian Jerusalem . Rome ruled out any confrontation at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher as " too dramatic , " although the two men may go there later to join in common prayer . It is expected that the Pope and Athenagoras will talk for about an hour and exchange gifts . <P> During a busy Christmas week , in which he received an enthusiastic welcome ( including the gift of a white lamb ) from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pilgrimage as " a journey of prayer , made with humility and with love . " In fact , the trip will be a protocol-hedged ordeal for the Pope , who will have to pray while under the eyes and cameras of more than 1,000 newsmen , 8,000 policemen and 500,000 Jordanians and Israelis . The trip was planned to avoid adding to Near Eastern tensions , but some bitterness inevitably was aroused ; Arab papers complained about the Pope 's visiting Israel as well as Jordan , and Jerusalem 's Chief Rabbi refused to take part in Israel 's welcoming ceremonies . <P> With his retinue of about 30 clerics and guards , Pope Paul will leave Italy early on Jan. 4 by a leased Alitalia DC-8 , which will fly around Israel and get an escort of Jordanian Air Force fighter planes before setting down at Amman around noon . Despite the personal character of his trip , the Pope will have to accept the pomp of welcome due to a head of state : King Hussein will be on hand to greet him , and cannons will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
