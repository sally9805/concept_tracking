Confused as they may seem elsewhere , Republicans are doing pretty well in , of all places , the South . Until recent years , Southerners had three choices : they could be conservative Democrats , middle-road Democrats or liberal Democrats . Now the G.O.P. is giving many voters a respectable opposition party to repair to . And Democrats are reacting to a threat they have not faced in a century . A state-by-state rundown of the less and less Solid South : <P> ALABAMA . Two years ago , the Republicans had moribund organizations in ten of Alabama 's 67 counties . Thanks to Gadsden Businessman James Mar tin 's near victory in 1962 over Democratic Senator Lister Hill and to the efforts of Republican State Chairman John Grenier , the G.O.P. now has organizations in 63 counties , plans to put up candidates for all eight congressional seats in 1964 . Martin stands a good chance of winning one of them . <P> ARKANSAS . This is a Goldwater state , but " Mr. Republican " is a Rockefeller - Winthrop , that is . Since becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G.O.P. groups in all 75 counties , even clubs for Little Rock teenagers and Hot Springs pensioners . Barry 's boys distrusted Rockefeller , figuring that he was just trying to put together an organization for Brother Nelson , but he reassured them by staking out a middle-of-the-road position . " I am not as liberal as my brother and not as conservative as Mr. Goldwater , " said he . He resigned as head of the Arkansas Industrial Development Commission , which brought 90,000 new jobs to the state during his eight-year tenure , and two weeks ago announced his candidacy for Governor . His opponent is almost sure to be Orval Faubus , who is after an unprecedented sixth term . Faubus is probably unbeatable , but Democratic and Republican pros agree that Winthrop could defeat almost anyone else . <P> FLORIDA . " On the national level , we have a two-party state , " says State Chairman Tom Brown . " On the local level , we do n't have it yet . " Florida voted Republican in the last three presidential elections , but locally has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counties . The party 's strength is restricted to the sun cities for retired old folk and central Florida 's industrial belt , and though the state has two G.O.P. Congressmen , six of its ten Democratic Congressmen are running without any opposition at all . <P> GEORGIA . In 1952 , says G.O.P. National Committeeman Robert Snodgrass , Georgia 's Republican organization could fit " in somebody 's hatband . " Today there are organizations in 130 of 159 counties . Republicans have elected two city councilmen in Atlanta , another in Augusta , two state representatives , four state senators , and they are contesting several congressional races this fall . All this has gotten the Democrats out of their hammocks . They recently opened their first fulltime state headquarters in Atlanta . " Let 's face it , " says one Georgia Democrat , " it 's the first time we ever had to . "
