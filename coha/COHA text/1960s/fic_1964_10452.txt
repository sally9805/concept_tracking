out when she wanted to ? And did n't I make all the arrangements , even for the Gersbachs  --  so we could all leave the Berkshirestogether ? " What else did she complain of ? " said Herzog . Zelda considered him for a moment as though to see whether he was strong enough to take it , and said , " You were selfish . " Ah , that ! He understood . The ejaculatio praecox ! His look becamestormy , his heart began to pound , and he said , " There was some trouble for a while . But not in the last two years . And hardly ever with other women . " These were humiliating explanations . Zelda did not have to believe them , and that made him the pleader , and put him at a frightful disadvantage . He could n't invite her upstairsfor a demonstration , or produce affidavits from Wanda or Zinka .

" No man can satisfy a woman who does n't want him , " said Herzog . " Well , is n't that your answer ? " Moses started to speak but he felt that he was going to make another foolish outcry . His face paled again and he kept his mouth shut . He was in terrible pain . It was so bad that he was far past claiming credit for his power to suffer as he had at times done . He sat silent , and heard the clothes dryer below whirling . " Moses , " said Zelda , " I want to make sure of one thing .

" He saw himself in the train window , hearing his own words clearly . " I think you 're on the level . " " You believe me , do n't you . " " I want to , naturally . " " You should . I 've got your interests at heart , too . I keep an eye on little June . " " I 'm grateful for that . " " But Madeleine is a good mother . And you do n't have to worry .

Anyhow , people like Moses Herzogdo n't grow on bushes , either . With your brains and charm , you wo n't be easy to replace . Anyhow , she 's always at home . She 's rethinking everything  --  her whole life . And there is nobody else . You know you can believe me . " Of course if you considered me dangerous it was your duty to lie .

Anyway , Zelda , I see you had tremendous pleasure , double excitement , lying from an overflowing heart . All at once the train left the platform and entered the tunnel . Temporarily in darkness , Herzog held his pen . Smoothly the tricklingwalls passed . In dusty niches bulbs burned . Without religion . Then came a long incline and the train rose from underground and rode in sudden light on the embankment above the slums , upper Park Avenue . In the east Nineties an open hydrant gushed and kids in clinging drawers leaped screaming . Now came Spanish Harlem , heavy , dark , and hot , and Queens far off to the right , a thick document of brick , veiled in atmospheric dirt .

The water was level and easy , soft blue , the grass brilliant , spattered with wildflowers  --  plenty of myrtle among these rocks , and wild strawberries blossoming . I now know the whole funny , nasty , perverted truth about Made- leine . Much to think about . He now had ended . But at the same high rate of speed , Herzog streaked off on another course , writing to an old friend in Chicago , Lucas As- phalter , a zoologist at the university . What 's gotten into you ? I often read " human-interest " paragraphs but I never expect them to be about my friends . You can imagine how it shook me to see your name in the Post . Have you gone crazy ? I know you adored that monkey of yours , and I 'm sorry he 's dead . But you should have known better than to try to revive him by mouth-to-mouth respiration . Especially as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bugs . Asphalter was queerly attached to his animals . Herzog suspected that he tended to humanize them . That macaque monkey of his , Rocco , was not an amusing creature , but obstinate and cranky , with a poor color , like a glum old Jewish uncle . But of course if he was slowly dying of consumption , he could n't have looked very optimistic . Asphalter , so cheerful himself and indiffer- ent to practical interests , something of a marginal academic type , without his Ph.D. , taught comparative anatomy . With thick crepe- soled shoes , he wore a stained smock ; he was bereaved of hair , of his youth , too , poor Luke . The sudden loss of his hair had left him with only one lock at the front , and made his handsome eyes , his arched brows prominent , his nostrils darker , hairier . I hope he has n't swallowed Rocco 's bacilli . There 's a new , deadlier strain at large , they say , and tuberculosis is coming back . As- phalter was a bachelor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Madison Street . In his youth , Moses had been there often , visiting . And although for an interval of ten or fifteen years he and Asphalter had not been close friends , they had found , sud- denly , a great deal in common . In fact it had been from Asphalter that Herzog learned what Madeleine was up to , and the part Gers- bach had been playing in his life . : 42 : " Hate to tell you this , Mose , " said Asphalter , in his office , " butyou 're mixed up with some awful nuts . " This was two days after the March blizzard . You would n't haveknown it had been raging winter that same week . The casement window was open on the Quadrangle . All the grimy cottonwoodshad sprung to life , released red catkins from their sheaths . These dangled everywhere , perfuming the gray courtyard with its shut-in light . Rocco with sick eyes sat on his own straw chair , his look lusterless , his coat the color of stewed onions . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Asphalter said . " I 'd better tell you  --  we have a lab assistant here who sits with your little girl , and she 's been telling me about your wife . " " What about her ? " " And Valentine Gersbach . He 's always there , on Harper Ave-nue . " " Sure . I know . He 's the only reliable person on the scene . Itrust him . He 's been an awfully good friend . " " Yes , I know  --  I know , I know , " said Asphalter . His pale roundface was freckled , and his eyes large , fluid , dark , and , for Moses'ssake , bitter in their dreaminess . " I certainly know . Valentine 's quite an addition to the social life of Hyde Park , what 's left of it . How did we ever get along without him . He 's so genial  --  he 's sonoisy , with those Scotch and Japanese imitations , and that gravel voice . He drowns all conversation out . Full of life ! Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you brought him here , everybody thinks he 's your special pal . He says so himself . Only . . . " " Only what ? " Tense and quiet , Asphalter asked , " Do n't you know ? " He becamevery pale . " What should I know ? " " I took it for granted because your intelligence is so high  --  wayoff the continuum  --  that you knew something or suspected . " Something frightful was about to descend on him . Herzognerved himself for it . " Madeleine , you mean ? I understand , of course , that by and by , because she 's still a young woman , she must . . she will . " " No , no , " said Asphalter . " Not by and by . " He blurted it out . " All the while . "  --  43 " Who ! " said Herzog . All his blood rose , and just as quickly and massively left his brain . " You mean Gersbach ? " " That 's right . " Asphalter now had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had gone soft with the pain he felt . His mouth looked chapped , with black lines . Herzog began to shout , " You ca n't talk like that ! You ca n't say that ! " He stared at Lucas , outraged . A dim , sick , faint feeling came over him . His body seemed to shrink , abruptly drained , hollow , numbed . He almost lost consciousness . " Open your collar , " said Asphalter . " My God , you are n't fainting , are you ? " He began to force Herzog 's head down . " Between the knees , " he said . " Let up , " said Moses , but his head was hot and damp and he sat doubled over while Asphalter gave him first aid . All the while , the large brown monkey , with arms folded over his chest , and red , dry eyes , was looking on , silently disseminating his grimness . Death , thought Herzog . The real thing . The animal was dying . " You better ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These zoology buildings stink . " " The window is open . Here , drink some water . " He handed Moses a paper cup . " Take one of these . Take this first , and then the green and white . Prozine . I ca n't get the cotton out of the bottle . My hands are shaking . " Herzog refused the pills . " Luke . . . Is this really true , about Madeleine and Gersbach ? " he said . Intensely nervous , pale , warm , looking at him with his dark eyes , his mottled face , Asphalter said , " Christ ! you do n't think I 'd invent such a thing . I probably have n't been tactful . I thought you must have had a pretty good idea . . . . But it 's absolutely true . " Asphalter in his soiled lab coat put it to him with a complicated helpless gesture  --  I lay it all before you , was what it said . His breathing was labored . " You did n't know anything ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense ? Does n't it add up now ? " Herzog rested his weight on the desk , knitting his fingers tightly . He stared at the dangling catkins , reddish and violet . Not to burst , not to die  --  to stay alive , was all he could hope for . " Who told you ? " he said.  --  44 : " Geraldine . " " Who ? " " Gerry  --  Geraldine Portnoy . I thought you knew her . Mady 's sitter . She 's down in the anatomy lab . " " What . . . " " Human anatomy , in the Med School , around the corner . I go out with her . In fact , you know her , she was in one of your classes . Do you want to talk to her ? " " No , " said Herzog violently . " Well , she 's written you a letter . She gave it to me and said she 'd leave it up to me , whether I should hand it over or not . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Asphalter . " You may want to read it later . " Herzog stuffed the envelope into his pocket . He was wondering , as he sat in the plush seat of the train , holding his valise desk , and leaving New York State at seventy m.p.h. , why he had n't cried in Asphalter 's office . He could burst into tears easily enough , and he was not inhibited with Asphalter , they were such old friends , so similar in their lives  --  their backgrounds , their habits , temperaments . But when Asphalter raised the lid , revealedthe truth , something bad was released in his office overlooking the Quadrangle ; like an odor , hot and raw ; or a queer human fact , almost palpable . Tears were not relevant . The cause was too perverse , altogether too odd for all concerned . And then , too , Gersbach was a frequent weeper of distinguished emotional power . The hot tear was often in his magnanimous ruddy-brown eye . Only a few days earlier , when Herzog landed at O'Hare and hugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful , burly figure with tears of compassion in his eyes . So evidently , thought Moses , he 's fucked up weeping for me , too . At moments I dislike having a face , a nose , lips , because he has them . Yes , the shadow of death was on Rocco , then . " Damn unpleasant , " said Asphalter . He smoked a bit and put out his cigarette . The tray was filled with long butts  --  he used up two or three packs a day . " Let 's have some drinks . Let 's all have dinner tonight . I 'm taking Geraldine to the Beachcomber , nearnorth . You ca n't size her up for yourself . " Now Herzog had to consider some strange facts about Asphalter . It 's possible that I influenced him , my emotionalism transmitted  --  45itself to him . He had taken that brooding , hairy Rocco into his heart . How else could you account for such agitation  --  lifting Rocco in his arms and forcing his lips open , breathing mouth to mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . I must try to think about him as he is  --  strangeness and all . You 'd better take the tuberculin test . I had no idea that you . Herzog broke off . A dining-car steward rang the chimes for lunch , but Herzog had no time to eat . He was about to begin anotherletter . Dear Professor Byzhkovski , I thank you for your courtesy in Warsaw . Owing to the state of my health , our meeting must have been unsatisfactory to you . I sat in his apartment making paper hats and boats out of the Trybuna Ludu while he tried to get a conversationgoing . The professor  --  that tall powerful man in a sandytweedshooting costume of knickers and Norfolk jacket  --  must have been astonished . I 'm convinced he has a kind nature . His blue eyes are the good sort . A fat but shapely face , thoughtful and manly . I kept folding the paper hats  --  I must have been thinking of the children . Mme. Byzhkovski asked me did I want jam in my tea , bending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of a vanished Central European epoch  --  but then this present epoch is vanishing , too , and perhaps faster than all the others . I hope you will forgive me . I have now had an opportunity to read your study of the American Occupation of West Germany . Many of the facts are disagreeable . But I was never consulted by President Truman , nor by Mr. McCloy . I must confess I have n't examined the Germanquestion as closely as I should . None of the governments are truthful , in my opinion . There is also an East German question not even touched upon in your monograph . I wandered in Hamburg into the red-light district . That is , I was told that I should see it . Some of the whores , in black lace underthings , wore German military boots and rapped at you with riding crops on the windowpanes . Broads with red complexions , calling and grinning . A cold , joyless day . Dear Sir , wrote Herzog . You have been very patient with the Bowery bums who enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pews , break bottles on the gravestones , and commit more nuisances . I would suggest that as you can see Wall Street from your church door you might prepare a pamphlet to explain that the.46 . Bowery gives additional significance to it . Skid Row is the contrastinginstitution , therefore necessary . Remind them of Lazarus and Dives . Because of Lazarus , Dives gets an extra kick , a bonus , from his luxuries . No , I do n't believe Dives is having such a hot time , either . And if he wants to free himself , the doom of Skid Row awaits him . If there were a beautiful poverty , a moral poverty in America , that would be subversive . Therefore it has to be ugly . Therefore the bums are working for Wall Street  --  confessors of the name . But the Reverend Beasley , where does he get his dough ? We have thought too little on this . He then wrote , Credit Department , Marshall Field &; Co. 1 am no longer responsible for the debts of Madeleine P. Herzog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband and wife . So do n't send me any more bills  --  I was knocked over by the last  --  more than four hundred dollars . For purchases made after the separation . Of course I should have written sooner  --  to what is called the credit nerve-center  --  Is there such a thing ? Where can you find it ?  --  but I temporarily lost my bearings . Dear Professor Hoyle , I do n't think I understand just how the Gold-Pore Theory works . How the heavier metals  --  iron , nickel  --  get to the center of the earth , I think I see . But what about the concentration of lighter metals ? Also , in your explanation of the formation of smaller planets , including our tragic earth , you speak of adhesive materials that bind the agglomerates of precipitated matter . . . . The wheels of the cars stormed underneath . Woods and pastures ran up and receded , the rails of sidings sheathed in rust , the dipping racing wires , and on the right the blue of the Sound , deeper , stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' cars , and the heaped bodies of junk cars , the shapes of old New England mills with narrow , austere windows ; villages , convents ; tugboats moving in the swelling fabric-like water ; and then plantations of pine , the needles on the ground of a life-giving russet color . So , thought Herzog , acknowledging that his imagination of the universe was elementary , the novae bursting and the worlds coming into being , the invisible magnetic spokes by means of which bodies kept one another in orbit . Astronomers made it all sound as though the gases were shaken up inside a flask . Then after many billions of years , light-years , this childlike but far from innocent:47  --  creature , a straw hat on his head , and a heart in his breast , part pure , part wicked , who would try to form his own shaky picture of this magnificent web .

I never knew where to begin . One ca n't become Utopian . It only makes it harder to discover where your duty really lies . Persuading the owners of large estates to give up some land to impoverished peasants , however . . . These dark men going on foot through India . In his vision Herzog saw their shining eyes , and the light of spirit within them . You must start with injustices that are obvious to everybody , not with big historical perspectives . Recently , I saw Pather Panchali . I assume you know it , since the subject is rural India . Two things affected me greatly  --  the old crone scooping the mush with her fingers and later going into the weeds to die ; and the death of the young girl in the rains . Herzog , almost alone in the Fifth Avenue Playhouse , cried with the child 's mother when the hysterical death music started . Some musician with a native brass horn , imitating sobs , playing a death noise . It was raining also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart was aching . He too had a daughter , and his mother too had been a poor woman . He had slept on sheets made of flour sacks . The best type for the purpose was Ceresota . What he had vaguely in mind was to offer his house and property in Ludeyville to the Bhave movement . But what could Bhave do with it ? Send Hindus to the Berkshires ? It would n't be fair to them . Anyway , there was a mortgage . A gift should be made in what they call " fee simple , " and for that I 'd have to raise another eight thousand bucks , and the Internal Revenue would n't give me a deduction on it . Foreign charities probably do n't count . Bhave would be doing him a favor . That house was one of his biggest mistakes . It was bought in a dream of happiness , an old ruin of a place but with enormous possibilities  --  great old trees , formal gardens he could restore in his spare time . The place had been deserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and use it ; and when Herzog posted the property the lovers and the hunters played jokes on him . Someone came in the night and left a used sanitary napkin in a covered dish on his desk , where he kept bundles of  --  48 : notes for his Romantic studies . That was his reception by the natives . A momentary light of self-humor passed over his face as the train flashed through meadows and sunny pines . Suppose I accepted the challenge . I could be Moses , the old Jew-man of Ludeyville , with a white beard , cutting the grass under the washline with my antique reel-mower . Eating woodchucks . He wrote to his cousin Asher , in Beersheba , I mentioned an old photograph of your father in his Czarist uniform . I have asked my sister Helen to look for it . Asher had served in the Red Army and was wounded . He was now an electro-welder , a moody-looking man with strong teeth . He went with Moses to visit the Dead Sea . It was sultry . They sat down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asher said , " Do n't you have a picture of my father ? " Dear Mr. President , I listened to your recent optimistic message on the radio and thought that in respect to taxes there was little to justify your optimism . The new legislation is highly discriminatory and many believe it will only aggravate unemployment problems by accelerating automation . This means that more adolescent gangs will dominate the underpoliced streets of big cities . Stresses of overpopulation , the race question . . . Dear Doktor Professor Heidegger , I should like to know what you mean by the expression " the fall into the quotidian . " When did this f all occur ? Where were we standing when it happened ? Mr. Emmett Straw f orth , U.S. Public Health Service , he wrote . Dear Emmett , I saw you on television making a damn fool of yourself . Since we were undergraduates together ( M. E. Herzog ' 38 ) I feel free to tell you what I think of your philosophy . Herzog crossed this out and readdressed his letter to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emmett Straw forth , has come forward with the Philosophy of Risk in the controversy over fallout , to which has now been added the problem of chemical pesticides , contamination of ground water , etc . I am as deeply concerned with the social and ethical reasoning of scientists as I am with those other forms of poisoning . Dr. Straw forth on Rachel Carson , Dr. Teller on the genetic effects of radioactivity . Recently Dr. Teller argued that the new fashion of tight pants , by raising body temperatures , could affect the gonads more than fallout . People greatly respected in their generation often turn out to be dangerous lunatics . Take Field Marshal Haig . He drowned hundreds  --  49of thousands of men in the mudholes of Flanders . Lloyd George was obliged to sanction this because Haig was such an important and respected leader . Such people simply have to be allowed to do their stuff . How paradoxical it is that a man who uses heroin may get a 20-year sentence for what he does to himself . . . . They 'll see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philosophy of Risk with regard to radioactivity . Since Hiroshima ( and Mr. Truman calls people Bleeding Hearts when they question his Hiroshima decision ) life in civilized countries ( because they survive through a balance of terror ) stands upon a foundation of risk . So argues Dr. Strawforth . But then he compares human life to Risk Capital in business . What an idea ! Big business takes no chances , as the recentstockpiling investigation showed . I should like to call your attention to one of de Tocqueville 's prophecies . He believed moderndemocracies would produce less crime , more private vice . Perhaps he should have said less private crime , more collective crime . Much of this collective or organizational crime has the objectprecisely of reducing risk . Now I know it 's no cinch to manage the affairs of this planet with its population exceeding 2 billion . The number itself is something of a miracle and throws our practical ideas into obsolescence . Few intellectuals have grasped the social principles behind this quantitative transformation . Ours is a bourgeois civilization . I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the vocabularies of modern art and religion it is bourgeois to consider that the universe was made for our safe use and to give us comfort , ease , and support . Light travelsat a quarter of a million miles per second so that we can see to comb our hair or to read in the paper that ham hocks are cheaper than yesterday . De Tocqueville considered the impulse toward well-being as one of the strongest impulses of a democratic society . He ca n't be blamed for underestimating the destructive powers generated by this same impulse . You must be out of your mind to write to the Times like this ! There are millions of bitter Voltairean types whose souls are filled with angry satire and who keep looking for the keenest , most poisonous word . You could send in a poem instead , you nitwit . Why should you be more right out of sheer distractionthan they are out of organization ? You ride in their trains , do n't you ? Distraction did n't build the railroad . Go on , write apoem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poems as fillers on the editorial page . But he continued his letter , nevertheless . Nietzsche , Whitehead , and John Dewey wrote on the question of Risk . . . . Dewey tells us that mankind distrusts its own nature and tries to find stability beyond or above , in religion or philosophy . To him the past often means the erroneous . But Moses checked himself . Come to the point . But what was the point ? The point was that there were people who could destroy mankind and that they were foolish and arrogant , crazy , and must be begged not to do it . Let the enemies of life step down . Let each man now examine his heart . Without a great change of heart , I would not trust myself in a position of authority . Do I love mankind ? Enough to spare it , if I should be in a position to blow it to hell ? Now let us all dress in our shrouds and walk on Washington and Moscow . Let us lie down , men , women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue  --  we may not deserve it , but let it continue . " In every community there is a class of people profoundly dangerous to the rest . I do n't mean the criminals . For them we have punitive sanctions . I mean the leaders . Invariably the most dangerouspeople seek the power . While in the parlors of indignation the right-thinking citizen brings his heart to a boil . Mr. Editor , we are bound to be the slaves of those who have power to destroy us . I am not speaking of Strawforth any more . I knew him at school . We played ping-gong at the Reynolds Club . He had a white buttocky face with a few moles , and fat curling thumbs that put a cheating spin on the ball . Clickety-clack over the green table . I do n't believe his I.Q. was so terribly high , though maybe it was , but he worked hard at his math and chemistry . While I was fiddling in the fields .

Marco was entering an age of silence and restraint with his father , but Junie was exactly as Marco had been . She stood on her father 's lap to comb his hair . His thighs were trodden by her feet . He embraced her small bones with fatherly hunger while her breath on his face stirred his deepest feelings . He had been wheeling the child 's stroller on the Midway , salutingstudents and faculty with a touch to the brim of his green velourshat , a mossier green than the slopes and hollow lawns . Under the tucks of her velvet bonnet , the little girl had very much her Papa 's looks , so he thought .

He had had the child at least , while mother and lover were undressing in a bedroom somewhere . And if , even in that embrace of lust and treason , they had life and nature on their side ,  - -  . he would quietly step aside . Yes , he would bow out . The conductor ( one of an ancient vanishing breed , this grayfacedconductor ) took the ticket from Herzog 's hatband . As he punched it , he seemed about to say something . Perhaps the straw hat carried him back to old times . But Herzog was finishing his letter .

Be-52 :  --  53sides , he had one of his most essential letters to write , to Dr. Edvig , the psychiatrist in Chicago . So , Edvig , Herzog wrote , you turn out to be a crook too ! How pathetic ! But this was no way to begin . He started over . My dear Edvig , I have news for you . Ah , yes , much better this way . A provokingthing about Edvig was that he behaved as if he were the one with all the news  --  this calm Protestant Nordic Anglo-Celtic Edvig with his grizzled little beard , clever , waving , mounting hair , and glasses , round , clean , and glittering .

Naturally I picked one who had written on Barth , Tillich , Brunner , etc .

You did , it 's undeniable , the more you learned from me that she was beautiful , had a brilliant mind , by no means sane , and was religious , to boot . And she and Gersbach managed and planned every step I took . They figured a headshrinker could help to ease me out  --  a sick man , exceptionally neurotic , perhaps even hopeless . Anyway the cure would keep me busy , absorbed in my own case . Four afternoons a week they knew where I was , on the couch , and so were safe in bed .

That elderly person in her green plush hat , unturbulent green , and like a deadly bag in soft folds on her head . But it was not such a bad day at that . Edvig said I was not off my rocker . Simply a reactive-depressive . " But Madeleine says I 'm insane . That I . . . " Eager and trembling , his sore spirit distorted his face , swelled his throat , painfully . But he was encouraged by the kindness of Edvig 's bearded smile . He then did his best to draw Edvig out , but all he would tell him that day was that depressives tended to form frantic dependencies and to become hysterical when cut off , when threatened with loss .

I swear it was at least half a spot . But her attitude seems to be , a Jew like me , what would I know about this stuff . " Herzog could see that Edvig was fascinated by every word about Madeleine . Nodding , he raised his head , his chin rose at every sentence , he touched his neat beard , his lenses glittered , he smiled . " You feel she 's a Christian ? " " She feels I 'm a Pharisee . She says so . " " Ah ? " Edvig sharply commented . " Ah , what ? " Moses said . " You agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely know you . But what do you think of the question ? " " Do you think that any Christian in the twentieth century has the right to speak of Jewish Pharisees ? From a Jewish standpoint , you know , this has n't been one of your best periods . " " But do you think your wife has a Christian outlook ? " " I think she has some home-brewed otherworldly point of view . " Herzog sat straighter in his chair , and pronounced his words with slight portentousness , perhaps . " I do n't agree with Nietzsche that Jesus made the whole world sick , infected it with his slave morality . But Nietzsche himself had a Christian view of history , seeing the present moment always as some crisis , some fall from classical greatness , some corruption or evil to be saved from . I call that Christian . And Madeleine has it , all right . To some extent many of us do . Think we have to recover from some poison , need saving , ransoming . Madeleine wants a savior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was the kind of thing Edvig apparently expected from Moses . Shrugging and smiling , he took it all as analytic material and seemed very pleased . He was a fair , mild man ; his shoulders had a certain slender squareness . Old-fashioned , with pink nearly colorless frames , his glasses made him drably , humbly , thoughtful and medical . By degrees , and I do n't quite know how it happened , Madeleine became the principal figure in the analysis , and dominated it as she dominated me . And came to dominate you . I began to notice how impatient you were to meet her . Because of the unusual facts of the case you said you had to interview her . By and by you were deep in discussions of religion with her . And finally , you were treating her , too . You said you could see why she had fascinated me . And I said , " I told you she was extraordinary . She 's brilliant , the bitch , a terror ! " So you knew , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they say ) , it was by no ordinary woman . As for Mady , she enriched her record by conning you . It all added to her depth . And because she was getting her Ph.D . in Russian religious history ( I guess ) , your sessions with her , at twenty-five bucks a throw , were for several months a course of lectures on Eastern Christianity . After this , she began to develop strange symptoms . First , she accused Moses of hiring a private detective to spy on her . She began this accusation with the slightly British diction he had learned to recognize as a sure sign of trouble . " I should have thought , " she said , " you 'd have been far too clever to engage such an obvious type . " " Engage , " said Herzog . " Whom have I engaged ? " " I mean that horrible man  --  that stinking , fat man in the sports coat . " Madeleine , absolutely sure of herself , flashed him one of her terrible looks . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply beneath contempt . " Seeing how pale she had become , he cautioned himself to be careful and above all not to mention the British manner . " But , Mady , this is simply a mistake . " " It is no mistake . I never dreamed you might be capable of this . " " But I do n't know what you 're talking about . " Her voice began to rise and tremble . She said fiercely , " You sonofabitch ! Do n't give me this soft treatment . I know all your fucking tricks . " Then she shrieked , " This must stop ! I will not have a dick tailing me ! " Staring , those marvelous eyes grew red . " But why would I have you followed , Mady ? I do n't understand . What could I find out ? " " Now that man dogged my steps around F-Field 's , all afternoon . " She often stammered when she was enraged . " I waited:54 : 1  --  55 : in the 1-1-ladies ' room half an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then in the LC. tunnel . . . when I was buying f-f-flowers . " " Maybe it was only some fellow trying to pick you up . It 's got nothing to do with me . " " That was a dick ! " She clenched her fists . Her lips were frighteninglythin , and her whole body trembled . " He was sitting on the screen porch next door this afternoon when I got home . " Moses , pale , said , " You point him out , Mady . I 'll go right up to him . . . Just show the man to me . " Edvig termed this a paranoid episode , and Herzog said , " Really ? " He took this in for a moment and then exclaimed , with a burst of feeling , looking at the doctor with large eyes , " Do you really think this was a delusion ? Do you mean to tell me she 's disturbed ? Insane ? " Edvig said , conservatively , measuring his words , " One incident like this does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a paranoid episode . " " But it 's she who 's sick , sicker than I am . " Ah , poor girl ! It was a clinical matter . She was really unwell . Toward the sick , Moses was always especially compassionate . He assured Edvig , " If she really is as you say , I 'll have to watch my step . I must try to take care of her . " Charity , as if it did n't have enough trouble in this day and age , will always be suspected of morbidity  --  sado-masochism , perversityof some sort . All higher or moral tendencies lie under suspicion of being rackets . Things we simply honor with old words , but betray or deny in our very nerves . At any rate , Edvig did not congratulate Moses on his pledge to look after Madeleine . " What I must do , " said Edvig , " is inform her of this tendency . " But it did not seem to disturb Madeleine to be warned professionallyagainst paranoid delusions . She said it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , she took the whole thing calmly . " Anyway , it 'll never be boring , " was what she said to Herzog . The trouble was not over yet . For a week or two , Field 's deliverytruck was bringing jewelry , cigarette boxes , coats and dresses , lamps , carpets , almost daily . Madeleine could not recall making:56 : these purchases . In ten days she ran up a twelve-hundred-dollar bill . All these articles were choice , very beautiful  --  there was some satisfaction in that . She did things in style , even when un- balanced . As he sent them back , Moses felt very tender toward her . Edvig predicted that she would never lapse into a true psy- chosis , but would have such spells for the rest of her life . It was melancholy for Moses , but perhaps his sighs expressed some satis- faction too . It was possible . The deliveries presently stopped . Madeleine turned back to her graduate studies . But one night , in the disorderly bedroom , when they were both naked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp remark about the old books underneath ( big , dusty volumes of an ancient Russian encyclopedia ) , it was too much for her . She began to scream at him , and threw herself on the bed , tearing off blankets and sheets , slamming books on the floor , then attacking the pillows with her nails , giving a wild , choked scream . There was a plastic cover on the mattress , and this she clutched and twisted , still curs- ing him shrilly , inarticulate , an odd white grime in the corners of her mouth . Herzog picked up the overturned lamp . " Madeleine  --  do n't you think you ought to take something . . . for this ? " Stupidly , he reached out a hand to soothe her , and at once she straightened and hit him in the face , too clumsily to hurt him . She jumped at him with her fists , not pummeling womanlike , but swinging like a street lighter with her knuckles . Herzog turned and took these blows on his back . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well that I did n't hit her . I might have won back her love . But I can tell you that my meekness during these crises infuriated her , as if I was trying to beat her at the reli- gious game . I know you discussed agape with her , and similar high ideas , but the least sign of the same in me put her in a frenzy . She thought I was a faker . For in her paranoid mind I was disinte- grated into my primitive elements . This is why I suggest her atti- tude might have changed if I had belted her . Paranoia is perhaps the normal state of mind in savages . And if my soul , out of season , out of place , experienced these higher emotions , I could get no credit for them anyway . Not from you , with your attitudes toward good intentions . I 've read your stuff about the psychological real-57  --  ism of Calvin . I hope you do n't mind my saying that it reveals a lousy , cringing , grudging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Protestant Freudianism . Edvig sat calmly through Herzog 's description of the assault in the bedroom , smiling a bit . Then he said , " Why do you suppose it happened ? " " Something about the books , maybe . Interference with her studies . If I say the house is dirty , it stinks , she thinks I 'm criticizingher mind and forcing her back into housework . Disrespectful of her rights as a person . . . " Edvig 's emotional responses were unsatisfactory . When he needed a feeling reaction , Herzog had to get it from Valentine Gersbach . Accordingly , he took his troubles to him . But first , ringing Gersbach 's doorbell , he had to face the coldness ( he could n't understand it ) of Phoebe Gersbach , who answered . She was looking very gaunt , dry , pale , strained . Of course  --  the Connecticut landscape raced , rose , contracted , opened its depths , and the Atlantic water shone  --  of course , Phoebe knew her husband was sleeping with Madeleine . And Phoebe had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband and protect her child . Answering the bell , she opened the door on foolish , feeling , sufferingHerzog . He had come to see his friend . Phoebe was not strong ; her energy was limited ; she must have been past the point of irony . And as for pity , what would she have pitied him for ? Not adultery  --  that was too common to be taken seriously by either of them . Anyway , to her , having Madeleine 's body could never seem a big deal . She might have pitied Herzog 's stupid eggheadedness , his clumsy way of putting his troubles into high-minded categories ; or simply his suffering . But she probably had only enough feeling for the conduct of her own life , and no more . Moses was sure that she blamed him for aggravating Valentine'sambitions  --  Gersbach the public figure , Gersbach the poet , the television-intellectual , lecturing at the Hadassah on Martin Buber . Herzog himself had introduced him to cultural Chicago . " Val 's in his room , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready for Temple . " Gersbach was putting up bookshelves . Deliberate , heavy , slowmoving , he measured the wood , the wall , and jotted figures on the plaster . He handled the level masterfully , looked over the toggle:58 : bolts . With his thick , ruddy-dark , judicious face and his broad chest and his artificial leg which made him stand tilted , he concentrated on the choice of a bit for the electric drill as he listened to Herzog 's account of Madeleine 's strange assault . " We were getting into bed . " " Well ? " He made an effort to be patient . " Both naked . " " Did you try anything ? " said Gersbach . A severe note entered his voice . " Me ? No . She 's built a wall of Russian books around herself . Vladimir of Kiev , Tikhon Zadonsky . In my bed ! It 's not enough they persecuted my ancestors ! She ransacks the library . Stuff from the bottom of the stacks nobody has taken out in fifty years . The sheets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have you been complaining again ? " " Maybe I have , a little . Eggshells , chop bones , tin cans under the table , under the sofa . . . . It 's bad for June . " " There 's your mistake ! Right there  --  she ca n't bear that nagging , put-upon tone . If you expect me to help straighten this out , I 've got to tell you . You and she  --  it 's no secret from anybody  --  are the two people I love most . So I must warn you , chaver , get off the lousy details . Just knock off all chicken shit , and be absolutely level and serious . " " I know , " said Herzog , " she 's going through a long crisis  --  findingherself . And I know I have a bad tone , sometimes . I 've gone over this ground with Edvig . But Sunday night . . . " " Are you sure you did n't make a pass ? " " No . It so happens we had intercourse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gazed at Moses with huming ruddy-dark eyes and said , " I did n't ask you that . My question was only about Sunday night . You 've got to learn what the score is , God damn it ! If you do n't level with me , I ca n't do a frigging thing for you . " " Why should n't I level with you ? " Moses was astonished by this vehemence , by Gersbach 's fierce , glowing look . " You do n't . You 're damn evasive . " Moses considered the charge under Gersbach 's intense redbrowngaze . He had the eyes of a prophet , a Shof at , yes , a judge in Israel , a king . A mysterious person , Valentine Gersbach . " We59had intercourse the night before . But as soon as it was done she turned on the light , picked up one of those dusty Russian folios , put it on her chest , and started to read away . As I was leaving her body , she was reaching for the book . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose , twitching . " Valentine gave a faint smile . " Maybe you should sleep sepa-rately . " " I could move into the kid 's room , I suppose . But June is restless as it is . She wanders around at night in her Denton sleepers . I wake up and find her by my bed . Often wet . She 's feeling the strain . " " Now knock it off , about the kid . Do n't use her in this . " Herzog bowed his head . He felt threatened by tears . Gersbach sighed and walked along his wall slowly , bending and straightening like a gondolier . " I explained to you last week . . . " he said . " You 'd better tell me once more . I 'm in a state , " said Herzog . " Now you listen to me . We 'll go over the ground again . " Grief greatly damaged  --  it positively wounded  --  Herzog 's handsomeface . Anyone he had ever injured by his conceit might now feel revenged to see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lectures Gersbach read him  --  those were so spirited , so vehement , gross , they were ludicrous , too , a parody of the intellectual 's desire for higher meaning , depth , quality . Moses sat by the window in raw sunlight , listening . The drapery with gilt-grooved rods lay on the table with planks and books . " One thing you can be sure , bruder , " said Valentine . " I have no ax to grind . In this thing , I just have no prejudice . " Valentine loved to use Yiddish expressions , to misuse them , rather . Herzog 's Yiddish background was genteel . He heard with instinctive snobbery Valentine'sbutcher 's , teamster 's , commoner 's accent , and he put himself down for it  --  My God ! those ancient family prejudices , absurdities from a lost world . " Let 's cut out all the shtick , " said Gersbach . " Let 's say you 're a crumb . Let 's say even you 're a criminal . There 's nothing  --  nothing !  --  you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shit , and you know it ! I can take what you 've done to me . " Moses , astonished again , said , " What have I done to you ? " " Hell with that . Hob es in drerd . I know Mady is a bitch . And maybe you think I never wanted to kick Phoebe in the ass . That klippa ! But that 's the female nature . " He shook his abundant hair into place . It had fiery-dark depths . At the back it was brutally6o. barbered . " You 've taken care of her for some time , okay , I know . But if she 's got a disgusting father and a kvetsch of a mother , what else should a man do ? And expect nothing in return . " " Well , of course . But I spent twenty grand in about a year . Everything I inherited . Now we 've got this rotten hole on Lake Park with the I.C. trains passing all night . The pipes stink . The house is all trash and garbage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there I am , returning Coke bottles and vacuuming , burning paper and picking up veal bones . " " The bitch is testing you . You 're an important professor , invited to conferences , with an international correspondence . She wants you to admit her importance . You 're a ferimmter mensch . " Moses , to save his soul , could not let this pass . He said quietly , " Berimmter . " " Fe  --  be , who cares . Maybe it 's not so much your reputation as your egotism . You could be a real mensch . You 've got it in you . But you 're effing it up with all this egotistical shit . It 's a big deal  --  such a valuable person dying for love . Grief . It 's a lot of bull ! " Dealing with Valentine was like dealing with a king . He had a thick grip . He might have held a scepter . He was a king , an emotionalking , and the depth of his heart was his kingdom . He appropriatedall the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . He could do more with them , and therefore he simply took them over . He was a big man , too big for anything but the truth . ( Again , the truth ! ) Herzog had a weakness for grandeur , and even bogus grandeur ( was it ever entirely bogus ? ) . They went out to clear their heads in the fresh winter air . Gersbachin his great storm coat , belted , bareheaded , exhaling vapor , kicking through the snow with the all-battering leg . Moses held down the brim of his dead-green velours hat . His eyes could n't bear the glitter . Valentine spoke as a man who had risen from terrible defeat , the survivor of sufferings few could comprehend . His father had died of sclerosis . He 'd get it , too , and expected to die of it . He spoke of death majestically  --  there was no other word for it  --  his eyes amazinglyspirited , large , rich , keen , or , thought Herzog , like the broth of his soul , hot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Gersbach . " Seven years old , in Saratoga Springs , running after the balloon man ; he blew his little.6r. fifel . When I took that short cut through the freight yards , crawling under cars . Lucky the brakeman found me as soon as the wheel took off my leg . Wrapped me in his coat and rushed me to the hospital . When I came to , my nose was bleeding . Alone in the room . " Moses listened , white , the frost did not change his color . " I leaned over , " Gersbach went on , as if relating a miracle . " A drop of blood fell on the floor , and as it splashed I saw a little mouse under the bed who seemed to be staring at the splash . It backed away , it moved its tail and whiskers . And the room was just full of bright sunlight . . . . " ( There are storms on the sun itself , but here all is peaceful and temperate , thought Moses . ) " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realized that my leg was gone . " Valentine would have denied that the tears in his eyes were for himself . No : curse that , he 'd have said . Not for him . They were for that little kid . There were stories about himself , too , that Moses had told a hundred times , so he could n't complain of Gersbach 's repetitiveness . Each man has his own batch of poems . But Gersbachalmost always cried , and it was strange , because his long curlingcoppery lashes stuck together ; he was tender but he looked rough , his face broad and rugged , heavy-bristled , and his chin positivelybrutal . And Moses recognized that under his own rules the man who had suffered more was more special , and he conceded willingly that Gersbach had suffered harder , that his agony under the wheels of the boxcar must have been far deeper than anything Moses had ever suffered . Gersbach 's tormented face was stony white , pierced by the radiant bristles of his red beard . His lower lip had almost disappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Molten sorrow ! Dr. Edvig , Herzog wrote , Your opinion , repeated many times , is that Madeleine has a deeply religious nature . At the time of her conversion , before we were married , I went to church with her more than once . I clearly remember . . . In New York . . . At her insistence . One morning when Herzog brought her to the church door in a cab she said he had to come in . He must . She said no relationship between them was possible if he did n't respect her faith . " But I do n't know anything about churches , " said Moses . She got out of the cab and went up the stairs quickly , expecting that he would follow . He paid the driver and caught up with her. : 62 : She pushed the swinging door open with her shoulder . She put her hand in the font and crossed herself , as if she 'd been doing it all her life . She 'd learned that in the movies , probably . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her face  --  where did that come from ? Madeleine in her gray suit with the squirrel collar , her large hat , hurried forward on high heels . He followed slowly , holding his salt-and-pepper topcoat at the neck as he took off his hat . Madeleine 's body seemed gathered upward in the breast and shoulders , and her face was red with excitement . Her hair was pulled back severely under the hat but escaped in wisps to form sidelocks . The church was a new building  --  small , cold , dark , the varnish shining hard on the oak pews , and blots of flame standing motionless near the altar . Madeleine genuflected in the aisle . Only it was more than genuflection . She sank , she cast herself down , she wanted to spread herself on the floor and press her heart to the boards  --  he recognized that . Shading his face on both sides , like a horse in blinders , he sat in the pew . What was he doing here ? He was a husband , a father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was he in church ? The bells tinged . The priest , quick and arid , rattled off the Latin . In the responses , Madeleine 's high clear voice led the rest . She crossed herself . She genuflected in the aisle . And then they were in the street again and her face had recovered its normal color . She smiled and said , " Let 's go to a nice place for breakfast . " Moses told the cabbie to go to the Plaza . " But I 'm not dressed for it , " she said . " In that case I 'll take you to Steinberg 's Dairy , which I prefer anyway . " But Madeleine was putting on lipstick , and fluffing out her blouse , and checking her hat . How lovely she could be ! Her face was gay and round , pink , the blue of her eyes was clear . Very different from the terrifying menstrual ice of her rages , the look of the murderess . The doorman ran down from his rococo shelter in front of the Plaza . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lobby . Palms and pink-toned carpets , gilding , footmen . . . I do n't quite understand what you mean by " religious . " A religiouswoman may find she does n't love her lover or her husband . But what if she should hate him ? What if she should wish continuallyfor his death ? What if she should wish it most fervently when.63they were making love ? What if in the act of love he should see that wish shining in her blue eyes like a maiden 's prayer ? Now , I am not simple-minded , Dr. Edvig . I often wish I were . It hardly does much good to have a complex mind without actually being a philosopher . I do n't expect a religious woman to be lovable , a saintly pussycat . But 1 would like to know how you decided that she is deeply religious . Somehow I got into a religious competition . You and Madeleine and Valentine Gersbach all talking religion to me  --  so I tried it out . To see how it would feel to act with humility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cowardice were humility , or obedience , not terrible decadence . Loathsome ! 0 , patient Griselda Herzog ! I put up the storm windows as an act of love , and left my child well provided , paying the rent and the fuel and the phone and insurance , and packing my valise . As soon as I was gone , Madeleine , your saint , sent my picture to the cops . If I ever set foot on the porch again to see my daughter , she was going to call the squad car . She had a warrant ready . The kid was brought to me , and taken home , by Valentine Gersbach , who also gave me advice and consolation , religion . He brought me books ( by Martin Buber ) . He commanded me to study them . I sat reading I and Thou , Between God and Man , The Prophetic Faith in a nervous fever . Then we discussed them . I 'm sure you know the views of Buber . It is wrong to turn a man ( a subject ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spiritual dialogue , the 1-It relationship becomes an 1-Thou relationship . God comes and goes in man 's soul . And men come and go in each other 's souls . Sometimes they come and go in each other 's beds , too . You have dialogue with a man . You have intercourse with his wife . You hold the poor fellow 's hand . You look into his eyes . You give him consolation . All the while , you rearrange his life . You even make out his budget for years to come . You deprive him of his daughter . And somehow it is all mysteriously translated into religious depth . And finally your suffering is greater than his , too , because you are the greater sinner . And so you 've got him , coming and going . You told me my hostile suspicions of Gersbach were unfounded , even , you hinted , paranoid . Did you know he was Madeleine 's lover ? Did she tell you ? No , or you would n't have said that . She had good reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nothing at all neurotic about it . Madeleine , your patient , told you what she liked . You knew nothing . You know nothing . She snowed you completely . And you fell in love with her yourself , did n't you ? Just as she planned . She wanted you to help her dump me . She would have done it in any case . She found you , however , a useful instrument . As for me , I was your patient . . . . .65EAR Governor Stevenson , Herzog wrote , gripping his seat in the hurtling train , Just a word with you , friend . I supported you in 1952 . Like many others I thought this country might be ready for its great age in the world and intelligence at last assert itself in public affairs  --  a little more of Emerson 's American Scholar , the intellectuals coming into their own . But the instinct of the people was to reject mentality and its images , ideas , perhaps mistrusting them as foreign . It preferred to put its trust in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who think a great deal and effect nothing , and those who think nothing evidently doing it all . You might as well be working for them , I suppose . I am sure the Coriolanus bit was painful , kissing the asses of the voters , especially in cold states like New Hampshire . Perhaps you did contribute something useful in the last decade , showing up the old-fashioned self-intensity of the " humanist , " the look of the " intelligent man " grieving at the loss of his private life , sacrificed to public service . Bah ! The general won because he expressed low-grade universal potato love . Well , Herzog , what do you want ? An angel from the skies ? This train would run him over .

He exclaimed mentally , Marry me ! Be my wife ! End my troubles !  --  and was staggered by his rashness , his weakness , and by the characteristic nature of such an outburst , for he saw how very neurotic and typical it was . We must be what we are . That is necessity . And what are we ? Well , here he was trying to hold on to Ramonaas he ran from her . And thinking that he was binding her , he bound himself , and the culmination of this clever goofiness might be to entrap himself . Self-development , self-realization , happiness  --  these were the titles under which these lunacies occurred . Ah , .66. poor fellow !  --  and Herzog momentarily joined the objective world in looking down on himself . He too could smile at Herzog and despisehim . But there still remained the fact .

Only diseased , tragic , or dismal and ludicrous fools who sometimes hoped to achieve some ideal by fiat , by their great desire for it . But usually by bullying all mankind into believing them . From many points of view , Ramona truly was a desirable wife . She was understanding . Educated . Well situated in New York . Money . And sexually , a natural masterpiece . What breasts !

Dear Moses E. Herzog , Since when have you taken such an in- terest in social questions , in the external world ? Until lately , you led a life of innocent sloth .

My memory abandoned me completein one place , and I was all wrong about Joachim da Floris . You and Joachim must both forgive me . I was in a terrible state . Having agreed to review Shapiro 's study before the trouble broke , Herzog could n't get out of it . He dragged the heavy volumewith him all over Europe in his valise . It caused much pain in his side ; he feared a hernia from it , and also ran up considerable overweight charges . Herzog kept reading away at it for the sake of the discipline , and under a growing burden of guilt . Abed in Belgrade , at the Metropol , with bottles of cherry juice , the trolley cars whizzing past in the frozen night . Finally , in Venice , I sat down and wrote my review . My excuse for the botch I made now follows : I assume , since he 's at Madison , Wisconsin , you 've heard that I blew up in Chicago last October . We left the house in Ludeyville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Slavonic languages . She had about ten courses in linguistics to take , and she got interested also in Sanskrit . Perhaps you can guess how she would work at things  --  her interests , passions . Do you remember that when you came to see us in the country two years ago , we discussedChicago ? Whether it would be safe to live in that slum . Shapiro in his stylish pin-striped suit , pointed shoes , as if dressed for dinner , sat on Herzog 's lawn . He has the profile of a thin man . His nose is sharp but his throat sags and his cheeks hang a little toward the lips . Shapiro is very courtly . And he was impressed with Madeleine . He thought her so beautiful , so intelligent . Well , she is . The conversation was spirited . Shapiro had come to see Moses ostensibly to get " advice "  --  actually to ask a favor  --  but he was enjoying Madeleine 's company . She excited him and he was laughing as he drank his quinine water . The day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His sharp black shoes glistened ; and he has fat feet , with bulging insteps . On the grass , mowed by himself , Moses sat in torn wash pants . Stirred by:68 : : 69Madeleine , Shapiro was particularly lively , almost shrieking when he laughed , and his laughter becoming more frequent , wilder , uncaused . His manner at the same time grew more formal , measured , judicious . He spoke in long sentences , Proustian he may have thought  --  actually Germanic , and filled with incredible bombast . " On balance , I should not venture to assay the merit of the tendencywithout more mature consideration , " he was saying . Poor Shapiro ! What a brute he was ! That snarling , wild laugh of his , and the white froth forming on his lips as he attacked everyone . Madeleine was greatly stirred by him too , and on her high manners . They found each other exceedingly stimulating . She came from the house with the bottles and glasses on the tray  --  cheese , liver paste , crackers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a yellow Chinese blouse , the coolie hat I bought her on Fifth Avenue . She said she was subject to sunstroke . Stepping quickly , she advanced from the shadow of the house into the sparkling grass , the cat leaping from her path , the bottles and glasses clinking . She hastened because she did n't want to miss any of the conversation . As she bent to set things out on the lawn table , Shapiro could n't keep his eyes from the shape of her behind in the tight cotton-knit fabric . Madeleine , " stuck away in the woods , " was avid for scholarly conversation . Shapiro knew the literature of every field  --  he read all the publications ; he had accounts with book dealers all over the world . When he found that Madeleine was not only a beauty but was preparing for her doctoral examination in Slavonic languages , he said , " How delightful ! " And it was he himself who knew , betrayingthe knowledge by affectation , that for a Russian Jew from Chicago'sWest Side that " How delightful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gotten away with it  --  old money , in the dry-goods business since 1880 . But Shapiro 's father had had no money , and peddled rotten apples from South Water Street in a wagon . There was more of the truth of life in those spotted , spoiled apples , and in old Shapiro , who smelled of the horse and of produce , than in all of these learned references . Madeleine and the dignified visitor were talking about the RussianChurch , Tikhon Zadonsky , Dostoevski , and Herzen . Shapiro made a great production of learned references , correctly pronouncingall foreign words whether in French , German , Serbian , : 70 : Italian , Hungarian , Turkish , or Danish , snapping them out and laughing  --  that hearty , sucking , snarling , undirected laugh , teeth moist , head worked back onto his shoulders . Ha ! The thorns crack- led . ( " Like the crackling of thorns under a pot is the laughter of fools . " ) The cicadas in great numbers were singing . That year , they came out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face did strange things . The tip of her nose moved , and her brows , which needed no help from cos- metics , rose with nervous eagerness , repeatedly , as if she were try- ing to clear her eyesight . Dr. Edvig said this was a diagnostic trait of paranoia . Beneath the huge trees , surrounded by the Berkshire slopes , with not another house in sight to spoil the view , the grass was fresh and dense , the slender , fine grass of June . The red- eyed cicadas , squat forms vividly colored , were wet after molting , sopping , immobile ; but drying , they crept , hopped , tumbled , flew , and in the high trees kept up a continuous chain of song , shrilling . Culture  --  ideas  --  had taken the place of the Church in Mady 's heart ( a strange organ that must be ! ) . Herzog sat thinking his own thoughts on the grass in Ludeyville , his wash pants torn , feet bare , but his face that of an educated Jewish gentleman with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on whom he doted ( with a trou- bled , angry heart , another oddity among hearts ) as she revealed the wealth of her mind to Shapiro . " My Russian is not what it could be , " said Shapiro . " But how much you know about my subject , " Madeleine said . She was very happy . The blood glowed in her face , and her blue eyes were warm and brilliant . They opened a new subject  --  the Revolution of 1848 . Shapiro had sweated through his starched collar . Only a dollar-crazed Croatian steelworker would have bought such a striped shirt . And what were his views of Bakunin , Kropotkin ? Did he know Com- fort 's work ? He did . Did he know Poggioli ? Yes . He did n't feel that Poggioli had done full justice to certain important figures  --  Rozanov , for instance . Though Rozanov was cracked on certain questions , like the Jewish ritual bath , still he was a great figure , and his erotic mysticism was highly original  --  highly . Leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Western Civilization , all the while repudiating the West and ridiculing it ! Madeleine , Her- zog thought , became almost dangerously excited . He could tell , : 71 : when her voice grew reedy , when her throat sounded positively like a clarinet , that she was bursting with ideas and feelings . And if Moses did not join in , if he sat there , in her own words , like a clunk , bored , resentful , he proved he did n't respect her intelligence . Now Gersbach always boomed along in conversation . He was so emphatic in style , so impressive in his glances , looked so clever that you forgot to inquire whether he was making sense . The lawn was on an elevation with a view of fields and woods . Formed like a large teardrop of green , it had a gray elm at its small point , and the bark of the huge tree , dying of dutch blight , was purplish gray . Scant leaves for such a vast growth . An oriole 's nest , in the shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's veil over things makes them all riddles . If they were not all so particular , detailed , and very rich I might have more rest from them . But I am a prisoner of perception , a compulsory witness . They are too exciting . Meantime I dwell in yon house of dull boards . Herzog was worried about that elm . Must he cut it down ? He hated to do it . Meanwhile the cicadas all vibrated a coil in their bellies , a horny posterior band in a special chamber . Those billions of red eyes from the enclosing woods looked out , stared down , and the steep waves of sound drowned the summer afternoon . Herzog had seldomheard anything so beautiful as this massed continual harshness . Shapiro mentioned Soloviev  --  the younger one . Did he really have a vision , in the British Museum , of all places ? It so happened that Madeleine had made a study of the younger Soloviev , and this was her opportunity . She had enough confidence now in Shapiroto speak freely  --  it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the career and thought of this dead Russian . Her offended look passed over Moses . She complained that he never really listened to her . He wanted to shine all the time . But that was n't it . He had heard her lecture on this subject many times , and far into the night . He did n't dare say he was sleepy . Anyway , it had to be quid pro quo , given these conditions  --  buried in the remoteBerkshires  --  for he had to discuss knotty points of Rousseauand Hegel with her . He relied completely on her intellectual judgments . Before Soloviev , she had talked of no one but Josephde Maistre . And before de Maistre  --  Herzog made up thelist  --  the French Revolution , Eleanor of Aquitaine , Schliemann 's excavations at Troy , extrasensory perception , then tarot cards , then Christian Science , before that , Mirabeau ; or was it mystery novels ( Josephine Tey ) , or science fiction ( Isaac Asimov ) ? The intensity was always high . If she had one constant interest it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd read . Black and hot under the green , the soil gave off its dampness . Herzog felt it in his bare feet . From Soloviev , Mady naturally turned to Berdyaev , and while speaking of Slavery and Freedom  --  the concept of Sobornost  --  she opened the jar of pickled herring . Saliva spurted to Shapiro 's lips . Quickly , he pressed his folded handkerchief to the corners of his mouth . Herzog remembered him as a greedy eater . In the cubicle they had shared at school , he used to chew his **31;5554;TOOLONG with an open mouth . Now at the smell of spice and vinegar Shapiro 's eyes flooded , though he managed to keep his portly , good-humored , sharp-nosed , refined look as he pressed the handkerchief to his shaven jowls . His plump hairless hand  --  his quivering fingers . " No , no , " he said , " thank you very much , Mrs. Herzog . Delightful ! But I have a stomach condition . " Condition ! He had ulcers . Vanity kept him from saying it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vomited in the wash basin . He must have eaten squid , thought Herzog , who had to do the cleaning up . Why did n't he use the toiletbowl  --  too stout to bend ? But that was in the aftermath of his visit . Before that , Moses recalled , there was a visit from the Gersbachs , Valentine and Phoebe . They stopped their little car under the catalpa tree  --  then in flower , though last year 's pods still hung from the twigs . Out came Valentine , in his swaying stride , and Phoebe , pale at every season of the year , calling after him in her complaining voice , " Val  --  Va-al . " She was returning a casserole she had borrowed , one of Madeleine 's great iron pots , red as lobster shell  --  Descoware , made in Belgium . These visits often gave Herzog a depressed feeling he could n't account for . Madeleine sent him for more folding chairs . Perhaps it was the rotted honey fragrance of the white catalpa bells that got him . Faintly lined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped on the gravel . Too beautiful ! Little Ephraim.7a.  --  73Gersbach was making a pile of bells . Moses was glad to go for the chairs , into the musty disorder of the house , down to the stony deaf security of the cellar . He took his time about the chairs . When he returned , they were speaking of Chicago . Gersbach , standing with his hands in his hip pockets , his face just shaved and his plumelike hair revealing heavy copper depths , was saying that his advice was to get the hell out of this backwater . Nothing interestinghad happened here since the Battle of Saratoga , over the hills , for Christ 's sake . Phoebe , looking tired and pale , smoked her cigarette , faintly smiling , and hoping , probably , to be let alone . Among assertive , learned , or eloquent people , she seemed to feel her dowdiness and insufficiency . Actually she was far from stupid . She had fine eyes , a bosom , good legs . If only she did n't make herselflook like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Chicago , by all means ! " said Shapiro . " That 's the school for graduate studies . A little woman like Mrs. Herzog is just what the old place needs , too . " Fill your big mouth with herring , Shapiro ! Herzog thought , and mind your own fucking business . Madeleine gave her husband a rapid sidelong look . She was flattered , happy . She wanted him to be reminded , if he had forgotten , how high a value other people set upon her . Anyway , Shapiro , I was in no mood for Joachim da Floris and the hidden destiny of Man . Nothing seemed especially hidden  --  it was all painfully clear . Listen , you said long ago , already pompous as a young student , that someday we would " join issue , " meaning there were important differences between us even then . I think it must have started in that seminar on Proudhon and the long argumentswe had , back and forth with old Larson , about the decay of the religious foundations of civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done for , the consciousness of the masses not yet ready for the next development ? Is this the full crisis of dissolution ? Has the filthy moment come when moral feeling dies , conscience disintegrates , and respect for liberty , law , public decency , all the rest , collapses in cowardice , decadence , blood ? Old Proudhon 's visions of darkness and evil ca n't be passed over . But we must n't forget how quickly the visions of genius become the canned goods of the intellectuals . The canned sauerkraut of Spengler 's  --  74 " Prussian Socialism , " the commonplaces of the Wasteland outlook , the cheap mental stimulants of Alienation , the cant and rant of pipsqueaks about Inauthenticity and Forlornness . I ca n't accept this foolish dreariness . We are talking about the whole life of mankind . The subject is too great , too deep for such weakness , cowardice  --  too deep , too great , Shapiro . It torments me to insanity that you should be so misled . A merely aesthetic critique of modern history ! After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this . You inherited rich blood . Your father peddled apples . I do n't pretend that my position , on the other hand , is easy . We are survivors , in this age , so theories of progress ill become us , becausewe are intimately acquainted with the costs . To realize that you are a survivor is a shock . At the realization of such election , you feel like bursting into tears . As the dead go their way , you want to call to them , but they depart in a black cloud of faces , souls . They flow out in smoke from the extermination chimneys , and leave you in the clear light of historical success  --  the technical success of the West . Then you know with a crash of the blood that mankind is making it  --  making it in glory though deafened by the explosions of blood . Unified by the horrible wars , instructed in our brutal stupidity by revolutions , by engineered famines directed by " ideologists " ( heirs of Marx and Hegel and trained in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( can it be ! ) , have done the nearly impossible , namely , learned something . You know that the decline and doom of civilization refuses to follow the model of antiquity . The old empires are shattered but those same one-time powers are richer than ever . I do n't say that the prosperity of Germanyis altogether agreeable to contemplate . But there it is , less than twenty years after the demonic nihilism of Hitler destroyed it . And France ? England ? No , the analogy of the decline and fall of the classical world will not hold for us . Something else is happening , and that something lies closer to the vision of Comte  --  the results of rationally organized labor  --  than to that of Spengler . Of all the evils of standardization in the old bourgeois Europe of Spengler , perhaps the worst was the standardized pedantry of the Spenglers themselves  --  this coarse truculence born in the Gymnasium , in cultural drill administered by an old-fashioned bureaucracy . I intended in the country to write another chapter in the history  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambition in modern Europe . Emergent plebeian classes fought for food , power , sexual privileges , of course . But they fought also to inherit the aristocratic dignity of the old regimes , which in the modern age might have claimed the right to speak of decline . In the sphere of culture the newly risen educated classes caused confusion betweenaesthetic and moral judgments . They began with anger over the industrial defilement of landscapes ( Ruskin 's British " Vales of Tempe " ) and ended by losing sight of the old-fashioned moral characteristics of the Ruskins . Reaching at last the point of denying the humanity of the industrialized , " banalized " masses . It was easy for the Wastelanders to be assimilated to totalitarianism . Here the responsibility of artists remains to be assessed . To have assumed , for instance , that the deterioration of language and its debasement was tantamount to dehumanization led straight to cultural fascism . I planned also to consider the whole question of models , of imitatio , in the history of civilization . After long study of the ancien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects of the high traditions of the court , the politics , the theater of Louis XIV on French ( and therefore European ) personality . Circumstances of bourgeois privacy in the modern age deprived individuals of scope for Grand Passions , and it is here that one of the most fascinatingbut least amiable tendencies of the Romantics develops . ( One of the results of this sort of personal drama is that , to the colonial world , Western Civilization dramatized itself as Aristocratic . ) I had a chapter in progress , when you visited , called " The American Gentleman , " a short history of social climbing . And there was I , myself , in Ludeyville , as Squire Herzog . The Graf Pototskyof the Berkshires . It was quite a funny twist of events , Shapiro . While you and Madeleine were tossing your heads , coquetting , bragging , showing off your clean sharp teeth  --  the learned badinage  --  I was trying to take stock of my position . I understood that Madeleine 's ambition was to take my place in the learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final elevation , as queen of the intellectuals , the castiron bluestocking . And your friend Herzog writhing under this sharp elegant heel . Ah , Shapiro , the victor of Waterloo drew apart to shed bitter tears for the dead ( slain under his orders ) . Not so my ex-Missis. : 76 : She does not live between two contradictory Testaments . She is stronger than Wellington . She wants to live in the delirious professions , as Valery calls them  --  trades in which the main instrument is your opinion of yourself and the raw material is your reputation or standing . As for your book , there is too much imaginary history in it . Much of it is simply utopian fiction . I will never change my mind about that . Nevertheless , I thought your idea about milleniarianism and paranoia very good . Madeleine , by the way , lured me out of the learned world , got in herself , slammed the door , and is still in there , gossiping about me . It was not terribly original , this idea of Shapiro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In my review I tried to suggest that clinical psychologistsmight write fascinating histories . Put professionals out of business . Megalomania for the Pharaohs and Caesars . Melancholiain the Middle Ages . Schizophrenia in the eighteenth century . And then this Bulgarian , Banowitch , seeing all power strugglesin terms of paranoid mentality  --  a curious , creepy mind , that one , convinced that madness always rules the world . The Dictatormust have living crowds and also a crowd of corpses . The vision of mankind as a lot of cannibals , running in packs , gibbering , bewailingits own murders , pressing out the living world as dead excrement . Do not deceive yourself , dear Moses Elkanah , with childish jingles and Mother Goose . Hearts quaking with cheap and feeble charity or oozing potato love have not written history . Shapiro 's snarling teeth , his salivating greed , the dagger of an ulcerin his belly give him true insights , too . Fountains of human blood that squirted from fresh graves ! Limitless massacre ! I never understood it ! I took a list of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to jot them down for me . It might aid my understanding , I thought . He did this willingly . I put the scribbled paper in my wallet and studied it like the plagues of Egypt . Just like " DOM , SFARDEYA , KINNIM " in the Haggadah . It read " Pride , Anger , Excessive Rationality , ' Homosexual Inclinations , Competitiveness , Mistrust of Emotion , Inability to Bear Criticism , HostileProjections , Delusions . " It 's all there  --  all ! I 've thought about Mady in every category , and though the portrait is n't yet complete.77 . I know I ca n't abandon a tiny child to her . Mady is no Daisy . Daisy is a strict , moody woman , but dependable . Marco has come through all right . Abandoning the letter to Shapiro  --  it raised too many painful thoughts , and this was precisely the sort of thing he must avoid if he was not to lose the benefit of a holiday  --  he turned to his brother Alexander . Dear Shura , he wrote , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a round 2000 . I need it . In the process of pulling myself together . Shura was a generous brother . The Herzogs had their characteristic family problems , but stinginess was not one of their traits . Moses knew that the rich man would push a button and say to his secretary , " Send a check to screwlooseMoses Herzog . " His handsome stout white-haired brother in his priceless suit , vicuna coat , Italian hat , his million-dollar shave and rosy manicured fingers with big rings , looking out of his limousinewith princely hauteur . Shura knew everyone , paid off everyone , and despised everyone . Toward Moses his contempt was softened by family feeling . Shura was your true disciple of Thomas Hobbes . Universal concerns were idiocy . Ask nothing better than to prosper in the belly of Leviathan and set a hedonistic example to the community . It amused Shura that his brother Moses should be so fond of him . Moses loved his relatives quite openly and even helplessly . His brother Willie , his sister Helen , even the cousins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could only sigh at himself , that he should be so undeveloped on that significant side of his nature . He sometimes tried to think , in his own vocabulary , whether this might be his archaic aspect , prehistoric . Tribal , you know . Associated with ancestor worship and totemism . Also , as I have been having legal troubles , I wonder whether you could recommend a lawyer . Perhaps one of Shura 's own legal staff who would not charge Moses for his services . He now composed a letter in his head to Sandor Himmelstein , the Chicago lawyer who had looked after him last autumn , after Madeleine put him out of the house . Sandor ! Last time we were in touch , I wrote from Turkey . Of all places ! And yet that suited Sandor , in a way ; it was Arabian Nights country and Sandor himselfmight have come out of a bazaar , for all that he had his office on the fourteenth floor of the Burnham Building , up the street  --  78  --  from City Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Postl 's Health Club , at Randolph and Wells . He was a short man , misshapenfrom the loss of part of his chest . In Normandy , he always said . He had probably been a sort of large dwarf when he enlisted . It must have been possible to get a commission in the Judge Advocate'sbranch though a dwarf . It made Herzog uneasy , perhaps , that he had been discharged from the Navy owing to his asthma and never saw action . Whereas this dwarf and hunchback was disabledby a mine near the beachhead . The wound had made a hunchback of him . Anyway , that was Sandor , with a proud , sharp , handsome face , pale mouth and sallow skin , grand nose , thin gray hair . In Turkey I was in sad condition . Partly , again , the weather . Spring was struggling to come in , but the winds changed . The sky closed over the white mosques . It snowed . The trousered , mannish Turkish women veiled their stern faces . I never expected to see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street , but the laborers had not appeared to shovel it , so the furnace was out . Herzog drank plum brandy and tea in the cafe , and chafed his hands and worked his toes inside his shoes to keep the blood going . He was worried about his circulation at that time . To see the early flowers covered by snow increased his gloom . I sent you this belated bread-and-butter note , to thank you and Bea for taking me under your roof . Acquaintances , not old friends . I 'm sure I was a terrible house guest . Sick and angry  --  broken by this lousy grief . Taking pills for my insomnia but still unable to sleep , going about drugged , and the whisky gave me tachycardia . I should have been in a padded cell . Gratitude ! I was deeply grateful . But the politic gratitude of weakness , of the sufferer , furious underneath . Sandor took me over . I was inept . He moved me into his house , far south , ten blocks from the Illinois Central . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Junie , to take her to the zoo and the like . Sandor said , " You wo n't mind sleeping next to the booze , I guess , " for the cot was unfolded beside the bar . The room was full of Carmel Himmelstein 's high-school crowd . " Get out ! " Sandor cried shrilly at the adolescents . " Ca n't see through the goddamn cigarette smoke ! Look at these Coke bottles filled with butts . " He turned on the air-conditioner , and Moses , still red with the cold of the day , but with white circles under his eyes , held his valise , the:79 : same valise that now lay in his lap . Sandor cleared the glasses from several shelves . " Unpack , kid , " he said . " Put your stuff here . We eat in twenty minutes . Good chow . Sauerbraten . Bea 's spe-cialty . " Obedient , Moses set out his things  --  toothbrush , razor , Desenex powder , sleeping pills , his socks , Shapiro 's monograph , and an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper on which Dr. Edvig had listed the traits of paranoia was his bookmark . After dinner , that first night in the Himmelsteins ' living room , Herzog began reluctantly to understand that in accepting Sandor 's hospitality he had made still another characteristic mistake . " You 'll get over this . That 's all right . You 'll make it , " said Sandor . " I 'll put my dough on you . You 're my boy . " And Beatrice , with her black hair and her pretty pink mouth which needed no rouge , said , " Moses , we know how you must feel . " " The bitches come and the bitches go , " said Sandor . " My whole practice , almost , is these bitches . You should know what they carry on , and what happens in this city of Chicago . " He shook his heavy head and his lips came together with the pressure of disgust . " If she wants to go , fuck her ! Let her go ! You 'll be okay . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a sucker for some type of broad . I always got clobbered by the blue-eyed kind , myself . But I had the sense to fall in love with this beautiful pair of brown eyes . Is n't she great ? " " She certainly is . " It had to be said . And it was actually not too difficult . Moses had not lived forty-odd years without learning to get through these moments . Among narrow puritans , this is lying ; but with civilized people only civility . " I 'll never know what she saw in a wreck like me . Anyway , Moses , you just stay with us for a while . At a time like this , you should n't be without friends . Sure , I know you have family of your own in this town . I see your brothers at Fritzl 's . I talked to your middle brother just the other day . " " Willie . " " He 's a fine fellow  --  very active in Jewish life , too , " said Sandor . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Now he 's connected with the Juice racket , and next with Jimmy Hoffa , and then he 's in with the Dirksen bunch . Well , okay , your8o : brothers are big shots . But they 'd make you eat your heart out . Here nobody 'll ask any questions . " " With us you can just let yourself go , " said Beatrice . " Well , I do n't understand this thing at all , " said Moses . " Mady and I had our ups and downs from the start . But things were improving . Last spring we discussed the marriage and whether we were getting along well enough to continue  --  a practical questioncame up : whether I should tie myself up with a lease . She said that as soon as she finished her thesis we 'd have a second child . . . . " " I 'll tell you , " said Sandor . " It 's your own frigging fault , too , if you want my opinion . " " Mine ? What do you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a highbrow broad . Somewhere in every intellectual is a dumb prick . You guys ca n't answer your own questions  --  still , I see hope for you , Mose . " " What hope ? " " You 're not like those other university phonies . You 're a mensch . What good are those effing eggheads ! It takes an ignorant bastard like me to fight liberal causes . Those silk-stocking Yale squares may have a picture of Learned Hand in the office , but when it comes to getting mixed up in Trumbull Park , or fighting those yellowbellies in Deerfield or standing up for a man like Tompkins  --  " Sandor was proud of his record in the case of Tompkins , a Negro in the postal service whom he had defended . " Well , I suppose they were out to get Tompkins because he was a Negro , " said Herzog . " But unfortunately , he was a drunk . You told me that yourself . And there was a question as to his compe-tence . " " Do n't go around repeating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used the wrong way . You going to blab what I told you confidentially ? It was a question of justice . Are n't there any white drunks on civil service ? Not much ! " " Sandor  --  Beatrice . I feel terrible . Another divorce  --  out again , at my time of life . I ca n't take it . I do n't know . . . it feels like death . " " Shush , what are you talking ! " said Sandor . " It 's pitiful because of the kid , but you 'll get over it . " At that time , when you thought , and I agreed , that 1 shouldn't:81 : be alone , perhaps I really should have been alone , Herzog wrote . " Look , I 'll handle the whole thing for you , " Sandor assured him . " You 'll come out of all this dreck smelling like a roast . Leave it to me , will you ? Do n't you trust me ? You think I 'm not leveling with you ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You ca n't be left to yourself , " said Sandor . " You 're not the type . A human being ! A mensch ! Your heart has been shat on . And you have about as much practical sense as my ten-year-old , Sheldon , you poor bastard . " " I 'm going to shake this off . I 'm not going to be a victim . I hate the victim bit , " said Moses . Himmelstein sat in his wing chair , his feet tucked under his short belly . His eyes were moist , the color of freshly sliced cucumber , with fine lashes . He chewed a cigar . His ugly nails were polished . He had his manicure at the Palmer House . " A strong-minded bitch , " he said . " Terrifically attractive . Loves to make up her mind . Once decided , decided forever . What a will power . It 's a type . " " Still , she must have loved you once , Moses , " said Bea . She spoke very , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes were set within strong orbital bones . Her lips were pink and vivid . Moses did not want to meet her gaze ; he would have to hold it long and earnestly and nothing would come of it . He knew he had her sympathy but that she could never approve of him . " I do n't think she loved me , " said Moses . " I 'm sure she did . " It was the middle-class female solidarity , defending a nice girl from charges of calculation and viciousness . Nice girls marry for love . But should they fall out of love , they must be free to love an- other . No decent husband will oppose the heart . This is orthodox . Not utterly bad . But a new orthodoxy . Anyway , thought Moses , he was in no position to quarrel with Beatrice . He was in her house , taking comfort from her . " You do n't know Madeleine , " he said . " When I met her , she needed a lot of help . The sort only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how long  --  endless  --  people 's stories are when they have grievances . And how tedious for everyone . " I happen to think she 's a nice person , " said Bea . " At first she looked stuck-up and acted suspicious , but when I got to know her : 8i : she turned out to be friendly and very nice . Basically , she must be a good person . " " Shit ! People are nice , most of them . You 've got to give ' em a chance , " said Sandor , sallow and handsome . " Mady planned it all out , " said Herzog . " Why could n't she break off before I signed the lease ? " " Because she has to keep a roof over the kid 's head , " said Sandor . " What do you expect ? " " What I expect ? " Herzog stood up , struggling for words . His face was white , his eyes dilated , fixed . He stared at Sandor , who was seated like a sultan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became aware that Beatrice with her pretty , lusterless look was warning him not to anger Sandor . His blood pressure was liable to shoot up dangerously when he was crossed . Herzog wrote , I was thankful for your friendship . I was in a state , though . One of those states in which one makes great , impossible demands . In anger people become dictatorial . Hard to take . I was trapped there . Sleeping next to the bar . My heart went out to poor Tompkins . No wonder he hit the bottle when Sandor took him over . " You 're not going to fight for the kid 's custody , are you ? " Sandor said to Herzog . " Suppose I do ? " " Well , " said Sandor , " speaking as a lawyer , I can see you with a jury . They 'll look at Madeleine , blooming and lovely , then you , haggard and gray-haired , and bam ! there goes your custody suit . That 's the jury system . Dumber than cave men , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear , but I better say it . Guys at our time of life must face facts . " " Facts ! " said Herzog , faint , groping , outraged . " I know , " said Sandor . " I 'm ten years older . But after forty it 's all the same . If you can get it up once a week , you should be grate-ful . " Beatrice tried to restrain Sandor , but he said , " Shut up . " He then turned to Moses again , shaking his head so that it gradually sank toward his disfigured breast , and his shoulder blades jutted behind , coracoid through the white-on-white shirt . " What the fuck does he know what it is to face facts . All he wants is everybodyshould love him . If not , he 's going to scream and holler . All  --  83right ! After D-Day , I lay smashed up in that effing limey hospital  --  acripple . Why , Christ ! I had to walk out under my own power . And what about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! That gimpy redhead knows what real suffering is . But he lives it up  --  three men with six legs could n't get around like that effing peg-leg . It 's okay , Bea  --  Moses can take it . Otherwise , he 'd be just another Professor Jerk . I would n't even bother with the sonofabitch . " Herzog was incoherent with anger . " What do you mean ? Should I die because of my hair ? What about the child ? " " Now , do n't stand there rubbing your hands like a goddamn fool  --  Christ , I hate a fool , " Sandor shouted . His green eyes were violently clear , his lips were continually tensing . He must have been convinced that he was cutting the dead weight of deception from Herzog 's soul , and his long white fingers , thumbs and forefingersworked nervously . " What ! Die ? Hair ? What the hell are you babbling ! I only said they 'd give the kid to a young mother . " " Madeleine put you up to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from suing . " " She nothing ! I 'm trying to tell you for your own good . This time , she calls the shots . She wins , and you lose . Maybe she wants somebody else . " " Does she ? Did she tell you that ? " " She told me nothing . I said maybe . Now calm down . Pour him a drink , Bea . Out of his own bottle . He does n't like Scotch . " Beatrice went to fetch Herzog 's own bottle of Guckenheimer 's 86 proof . " Now , " said Sandor , " stop this baloney . Do n't be a clown , man . " His look changed , and he let some kindness flow toward Herzog . " Well , when you suffer , you really suffer . You 're a real , genuine old Jewish type that digs the emotions . I 'll give you that . I understand it . I grew up on Sangamon Street , remember , when a Jew was still a Jew . I know about suffering  --  we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted , For the life of me , I could n't understand . I often thought I was going to have apoplexy , to burst . The more comfort you gave me , the closer I came to death 's door . But what was I doing ? Why was I in your house ? : 84 : It must have been funny how I grieved . Looking from my room at the leafless weeds in back . Brown , delicate frames of ragweed . Milkweed with the discharged pods gaping . Or else gazing at the dark gray face of the television . On Sunday morning , early , Sandor called Herzog into the living room . " Man , " he said , " I found one hell of an insurance policy for you . " Moses , tying his robe about him as he came from his bed by the bar , did n't understand . " What ? " " We can get you a terrific policy to cover the kid . " " What 's this about ? " " I told you last week but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get sick , have an accident , lose an eye , even if you go nuts , Junie will be protected . " " But I 'm going to Europe , and I have travel insurance . " " That 's if you die . But here , even if you have a mental breakdownand have to go to an institution the kid still gets hermonthly support . " " Who says I 'm breaking down ? " " Listen , you think I 'm doing this for myself ? I 'm in the middle here , " said Sandor , stamping a bare foot on the thick pile of the carpet . Sunday , with gray fog from the lake and the ore boats lowing like waterborne cattle . You could hear the emptiness of the hulls . Herzog would have given anything to be a deckhand bound for Duluth . " Either you want my legal advice or you do n't , " said Sandor . " I want to do the best for all of you . True ? " " Well , here I am to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Okay , so let 's talk sense . With Madeleine you 're not going to have trouble . She gets no alimony . She 'll be married soon . I took her to lunch at Fritzl 's , and guys who have n't given Sandor H. the time of day for years came running with a hard-on , tripping over themselves . That includes the rabbi of my temple . She 's some dish . " " You 're a lunatic . And I know what she is . " " What do you mean  --  she 's less of a whore than most . We 're all whores in this world , and do n't you forget it . I know damn well I 'm a whore . And you 're an outstanding shnook , I realize . At:85least the eggheads tell me so . But I bet you a suit of clothes you 're a whore , too . " " Do you know what a mass man is , Himmelstein ? " Sandor scowled . " How 's that ? " " A mass man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mob . Cuttingeverybody down to size . " " What soul of the mob ! Do n't get highfalutin . I 'm talking facts , not shit . " " And you think a fact is what 's nasty . " " Facts are nasty . " " You think they 're true because they 're nasty . " " And you  --  it 's all too much for you . Who told you you were such a prince ? Your mother did her own wash ; you took boarders ; your old man was a two-bit moonshiner . I know you Herzogs and your Yiches . Do n't give me that hoity-toity . I 'm a Kike myself and got my diploma in a stinking night school . Okay ? Now let 's both knock off this crap , dreamy boy . " Herzog , subdued , much shaken , had no answer . What had he come here for ? Help ? A forum for his anger ? Indignation for his injustices ? But it was Sandor 's forum , not his . This fierce dwarf with protruding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast protruded from his green pajama top . But this was Sandor 's bad , angry state , thought Herzog . He could be attractive , too , generous , convivial , even witty . The lava of that heart may have pushed those ribs out of shape , and the force of that hellish tongue made his teeth protrude . Very well , Moshe Herzog  --  if you must be pitiable , sue for aid and succor , you will put yourself always , inevitably , in the hands of these angry spirits . Blasting you with their " truth . " This is what your masochism means , mein zisse n'shamele . The good are attracted by men 's perceptions and think not for themselves . You must cleanse the gates of vision by self-knowledge , by experience . Besides which , opposition is true friendship . So they tell me . " You want to take care of your own kid , do n't you ? " said Sandor . " Sure I do . But you told me the other day that I might as well forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . " " That 's right . She wo n't even know you next time you see her . " Sandor was thinking of his own kids , those hamsters ; not my daughter , made of finer clay . She wo n't forget me . " I do n't believe it , " said Herzog. : 86 : " As the lawyer , I have a social obligation to the child . I 've got to protect her . " " You ? I 'm her father . " " You may crack up . Or else die . " " Mady is just as liable to die . Why do n't we write the insurance on her ? " " She 'd never let you . That 's not part of the woman 's deal . It 's the man 's deal . " " Not this man 's . Madeleine swings her weight like a male . She made all these decisions to take the kid and throw me in the street . She thinks she can be both mother and father . I 'll pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to yell . " I do n't give a shit about her . I do n't give a shit about you . I 'm looking after that child . " " What makes you so sure I 'll die first ? " " And is this the woman you love ? " Sandor said in a lower tone . Apparently , he had remembered his dangerously high blood pressure . An elaborate effort occurred which involved his pale eyes , and his lips , and which pitted his chin . He said more evenly , " I 'd take that policy myself if I could pass the physical . It would give me pleasure to croak and leave my Bea a rich widow . I 'd like that . " " Then she could go to Miami , and dye her hair . " " That 's right . While I turn green like an old penny , in my box , and she screws around . I do n't grudge her . " " All right , Sandor  --  " said Herzog . He wanted to end this talk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my death . " " What 's so great about your effing death ? " Sandor cried . His figure straightened . He stood very close to Herzog , who was somewhatfrightened by his shrillness and stared down , wide-eyed , at the face of his host . It was strong-cut and coarsely handsome . The small mustache bristled , a fierce green , milky poison rose to his eyes ; his mouth twisted . " I 'm getting out of this case ! " Himmelstein began to scream . " What 's the matter with you ! " Herzog said . " Where 's Beatrice ! Beatrice ! " But Mrs. Himmelstein only shut her bedroom door . " She 'll go to a shyster firm ! " " For God 's sake , stop screaming . " " They 'll kill you . " . u7 . " Sandor , quit this . " " Put you over a barrel . Tear your hide off . " Herzog held his ears . " I ca n't stand it . " " Tie your guts in knots . Sonofabitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and charge you for breathing . You 'll be locked up back and front . Then you 'll think about death . You 'll pray for it . A coffin will look better to you than a sports car . " " But I did n't leave Madeleine . " " I 've done this to guys myself . " " What harm did I do her . " " The court does n't care . You signed papers  --  did you read them ? " " No , I took your word . " " They 'll throw the book at you in court . She 's the mother  --  the female . She 's got the tits . They 'll crush you . " " But I 'm not guilty of anything . " " She hates you . " Sandor no longer screamed . He had resumed his normal loudness . " Jesus ! You do n't know anything , " he said . " You an educatedman ? Thank God my old pa did n't have the dough to send me to the U. of C. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Education ? It 's a laugh ! You do n't know what goes on . " Moses was shaken . He began to reconsider . " All right  --  " he said . " What 's all right ? " " I 'll take a policy on my life . " " Not as a favor to me ! " " Not as a favor . " " It 's a big bite  --  four hundred and eighteen bucks . " " I 'll find the money . " Sandor said , " All right , my boy . Finally you make some sense . Now what about some breakfast  --  I 'll cook porridge . " In his green paisley pajamas he set off for the kitchen on his long , slipperless feet . Following in the corridor , Herzog heard a cry from Sandor at the kitchen sink . " Look at this crap ! Not a pot  --  not a dish  --  there is n't a spoon that 's clean . It stinks of garbage . It 's just a sewer here ! " The old dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rappingon the tiles  --  clickclick , clickclick . " Spendthrift bitches ! " he shouted at the women of his house . " Frigging lice ! All they 're good.88. for is to wag their asses at the dress shops and play gidgy in the bushes . Then they come home , and gorge cake and leave plates smeared with chocolate in the sink . That 's what gives them the pimples . " " Easy , Sandor . " " Do I ask for much ? The old veteran cripple runs up and down City Hall , from courtroom to courtroom  --  out to Twenty-sixth and California . For them ! Do they care if I have to suck up to all kinds of pricks to get a little business ? " Sandor began to rake out the sink . He threw eggshells and orange rinds into the corner beside the garbage pail  --  coffee grounds . He worked himself into a rage and began to smash dishes and glassware . His long fingers , like those of a hunchback , gripped the plates soiled with icing . Without losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the wall . He knocked over the dish drainer and the soap powder , and then he wept with anger . And also at himself , that he should have such emotions . His open mouth and jutting teeth ! The long hairs streamed from his disfigured breast . " Moses  --  they 're killing me ! Killing their father ! " The daughters lay listening in their rooms . Young Sheldon was in Jackson Park with his scout troup . Beatrice did not appear . " We do n't have to have porridge , " said Herzog . " No , I 'll wash a pot . " He was still shedding tears . Under the torrentialtap his manicured fingers scrubbed the aluminum with steel wool . When he grew calmer , he said , " You know , Moses , I 've been to a psychiatrist about these effing dishes . They cost me twenty bucks an hour . Moses , what am I going to do with my kids . Sheldon 's goingto be all right . Tessie 's maybe not so bad . But Carmel ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm afraid the boys are getting into her pants already . Prof , while you 're here , I do n't ask anything from you " ( in return for bed and board , he meant ) " but I 'd appreciate it if you 'd take an interest in her mental development . This is her chance to know an intellectual  --  a famous person  --  an authority . Will you talk to her ? " " About what ? " " Books  --  ideas . Take her for a walk . Discuss with her . Please , Moses , I 'm begging you ! " " Well , of course I 'll talk to her . " .8g " I asked the rabbi  --  but what good are these reform rabbis ? I know I 'm a vulgar bastard , The Terrible-Tempered Mr. Bang . I work for these kids . . . . " He squeezes the poor . Buys credit paper from merchants who sell fancy goods on installments to prostitutes on the South Side . And it 's all very well for me to surrender my daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If Carmel was a little older , I 'd say , marry her . " Moses , pale and startled , said , " She 's a very attractive girl . Far too young , of course . " Sandor put his long arm about Herzog 's waist and drew him close . " Do n't be such a rolling stone , Prof. Start leading a normal life . Where the hell have n't you been  --  Canada , Chicago , Paris , New York , Massachusetts . Your brothers have done okay right here , in this town . Of course , what 's good enough for Alexander and Willie is n't good enough for a macher like you . Moses E. Herzog  --  he has no money in the bank , but you can look up his name in the library . " " I hoped that Madeleine and I would settle down . " " Out in the sticks ? Do n't be nuts . With that chick ? Are you kidding ? Come back to the home town . You 're a West Side Jew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish People 's Institute . Slow down . Stop knocking yourself out . I love you better than my own effing family . You never pulled that phony Harvard stuff on me . Stick with the folks  --  with good hearts . With love . Jesus ! What d'ye say ? " He drew away his big handsome sallow head a little distance , to look into Herzog 's eyes , and Herzog felt the circuit of affection enclosing them again . Himmelstein 's face with its long yellowgrooves was joyful . " Can you sell that dump in the Berkshires ? " " I might . " " Hell , it 's settled then . Take a loss if you have to . They 've ruined Hyde Park , but you do n't want to live with those longhair shmoes anyhow . Rent in my neighborhood . " Though he was tired out , and suffering at heart like a fool , Herzoglistened like a child to a tale . " Get yourself a housekeeper closer to your own age . And a good lay , too . What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gorgeous brownskin housekeeper . No more Japs for you . " " What do you mean ? " : 90 : " You know what I mean . Or maybe what you need is a girl who survived the concentration camps , and would be grateful for a good home . And you and I will lead the life . We 'll go to the Russian bath on North Avenue . They hit me at Omaha Beach , but screw ' em all , I 'm still going . We 'll live it up . We 'll find an orthodox shut  --  enough of this Temple junk . You and me  --  we 'll track down a good chazan . . . . " Forming his lips so that the almost invisible mustache thinly appeared , Sandor began to sing , " Mi pnei chatoenu golino m'artzenu . " And for our sins we were exiled from our land . " You and me , a pair of old-time Jews . " He held Moses with his dew-green eyes . " You 're my boy . My innocent kind-hearted boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potato love . Amorphous , swelling , hungry , indiscriminate , cowardly potato love . " Oh , you sucker , " Moses cried to himself in the train . " Sucker ! " I left you money for an emergency . You turned it all over to Madeleine to buy clothes . Were you her lawyer , or mine ? I might have understood , from the way he spoke of his female clients and assaulted all the men . But my God ! how did I get into all of that ? Why did I become involved with him at all ? I must have wanted such absurd things to happen to me . I was so far gone in foolishness that even they , those Himmelsteins , knew more than I. And showed me the facts of life , and taught me the truth . Revenged with hate on my own proud inanities . In the mild end of the afternoon , later , at the waterside in Woods Hole , waiting for the ferry , he looked through the green darkness at the net of bright reflections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of the sun , about light , about the ocean . The purity of the air moved him . There was no stain in the water , where schools of minnows swam . Herzog sighed and said to himself , " Praise God  --  praise God . " His breathing had become freer . His heart was greatly stirred by the open horizon ; the deep colors ; the faint iodine pungency of the Atlantic rising from weeds and mollusks ; the white , fine , heavy sand ; but principally by the green transparency as he looked down to the stony bottom webbed with golden lines . Never still . If his soul could cast a reflection so brilliant , and so intensely sweet , he might beg God to make such use of him . But that would be too simple . But that would be too childish . The actual sphere is not clear like this , but turbulent , angry . A vast human action is going on . Death watches . So if you have some:9I : happiness , conceal it . And when your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had moments of sanity , but he could n't maintain the balance for very long . The ferry came , he boarded it , pulling his hat tight in the sea wind , slightly shamefaced because he enjoyed this typical moment of a holiday . The cars were loaded in a cloud of blowing sand and marl while Herzog looked down from the upper deck . During the crossing he rested his feet on his up-ended valise , taking the sun , watching the boats through half-lidded eyes . In Vineyard Haven he caught a cab at the dock . It turned right on the main street parallel to the harbor , lined with big trees  --  water , sails on the right , and the road passing under leaves filled with sun . Big gilt letters shone on red store fronts . The shopping center was as bright as a stage set . The taxi went slowly , as if the old engine had a heart condition . It passed the public library , and pillared driveways , great lyre-shaped elm trees and sycamores with patches of white bark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important place in his life . The green of evening was set- fling in , and the blue of the water , when your eyes turned from the shadows of the grass , seemed paler and paler . The cab turned right again , toward the shore , and Herzog got out , missing half of the driver 's directions as he paid . " Down the stairs  --  up again . I get it . Okay . " He saw Libbie waiting on the porch in a bright dress , and waved to her . She blew him a kiss . At once he knew that he had made a mistake . Vineyard Haven was not the place for him . It was lovely , and Libbie was charming , one of the most charming women in the world . But I should never have come . It just is n't right , he thought . He appeared to be look- ing for the wooden treads on the slope , hesitating , a strong-looking man , holding his valise in a double grip like a player about to throw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; not the hands of a man whose occupation was mental , but of a born bricklayer or housepainter . The breeze swelled out his light clothes and then fitted them tightly to his body . And what a look he had  --  such a face ! Just then his state of being was so curious that he was compelled , himself , to see it  --  eager , grieving , fantastic , dangerous , crazed and , to the point of death , " comical . " It was enough to make a man pray to God to remove this great , bone-breaking burden of : 92 : selfhood and self-development , give himself , a failure , back to the species for a primitive cure . But this was becoming the up-todateand almost conventional way of looking at any single life . In this view the body itself , with its two arms and vertical length , was compared to the Cross , on which you knew the agony of consciousness and separate being . For that matter , he had been taking this primitive cure , administered by Madeleine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misfortunes might be seen as a collective project , himself participating , to destroy his vanity and his pretensions to a personal life so that he might disintegrate and suffer and hate , like so many others , not on anything so distinguished as a cross , but down in the mire of post-Renaissance , post-humanistic , postCartesiandissolution , next door to the Void . Everybody was in the act . " History " gave everyone a free ride . The very Himmelsteins , who had never even read a book of metaphysics , were toutingthe Void as if it were so much salable real estate . This little demon was impregnated with modern ideas , and one in particular excited his terrible little heart : you must sacrifice your poor , squawking , niggardly individuality  --  which may be nothing anyway ( from an analytic viewpoint ) but a persistent infantile megalomania , or ( from a Marxian point of view ) a stinking little bourgeoisproperty  --  to historical necessity . And to truth . And truth is true only as it brings down more disgrace and dreariness upon human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is illusion , and not truth . But of course he , Herzog , predictably bucking such trends , had characteristically , obstinately , defiantly , blindly but without sufficient courage or intelligence tried to be a marvelous Herzog , a Herzog who , perhaps clumsily , tried to live out marvelousqualities vaguely comprehended . Granted he had gone too far , beyond his talents and his powers , but this was the cruel difficultyof a man who had strong impulses , even faith , but lacked clear ideas . What if he failed ? Did that really mean that there was no faithfulness , no generosity , no sacred quality ? Should he have been a plain , unambitious Herzog ? No . And Madeleine would never have married such a type . What she had been looking for , high and low , was precisely an ambitious Herzog . In order to trip him , bring him low , knock him sprawling and kick out his brains with a murderous bitch foot . Oh , what a confusion he had madewhata waste of intelligence and feeling ! When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all that he had invested in arrangements  --  merely in practical measures , in trains and planes and hotels and department stores , and banks where he had banked , in hospitals , in doctors and drugs , in debts ; and , for himself , the nights of rigid insomnia , the yellow boring afternoons , the trials by sexual combat , and all the horrible egomania of it , he wondered that he had survived at all . He wondered , even , why he should have wanted to survive . Others in his generation wore themselves out , died of strokes , of cancer , willed their own deaths , conceivably . But he , despite all blunders , fuckyknucklesthat he was , he must be cunning , tough . He survived . And for what ? What was he hanging around for ? To follow this career of personal relationships until his strength at last gave out ? Only to be a smashing success in the private realm , a king of hearts ? Amorous Herzog , seeking love , and embracing his Wandas , Zinkas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a female pursuit . This hugging and heartbreak is for women . The occupationof a man is in duty , in use , in civility , in politics in the Aristoteliansense . Now then , why am I arriving here , in Vineyard Haven , on a holiday no less ! Heartbroken , and gussied up , with my Italian pants and my fountain pens , and my grief  --  to bother and pester poor Libbie , and exploit her affections , forcing her to pay off because I was so kind and decent when her last husband , Erikson , went off his rocker and tried to stab her and take the gas himself ? At which time , yes , I was very helpful . But if she had n't been so very beautiful , sexual , and obviously attracted to me , would I have been such a willing friend and helper ? And it 's not much to be pleased with that I bother her now , a bride of a few months , with my troubles . Have I come to collect the quid pro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next ferry back . All you needed was a train ride . It has turned the trick . Libbie came down the path to greet him , and gave him a kiss . She was dressed for the evening in an orange or poppy-colored cocktail dress . It took Moses an extra moment to determine whether the fragrance he smelled came from the nearby bed of peonies or from her neck and shoulders . She was unaffectedly happy to see him . By fair means or not , he had made a friend of her . " How are you ! " : 94 : " I 'm not going to stay , " said Herzog . " It 's not right . " " What are you talking about ? You 've been traveling for hours . Come inside and meet Arnold . Sit down and have a drink . You are funny . " She laughed at him , and he was obliged to laugh with her . Sissler came out on the porch , a man in his fifties , untidy and sleepy but cheerful , and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had on a pair of large pink slacks with a rubberizedwaistband . " He says he 's already on his way back , Arnold . I told you he was funny . " " You traveled all this way to tell us ? Come in  --  come in . I was going to light a fire . It gets colder in an hour and people are coming to dinner . What about a drink ? Scotch or bourbon ? Maybe you 'd like a swim instead ? " Sissler gave him a broad , amiable , wrinkled , black-eyed smile . These eyes were small and there were spaces between his teeth ; he was bald , his back hair was thick and projected like one of those large tree mushrooms that grow on the mossy side of a trunk . Libbie had married a comfortable , wise old dog , the kind who always turned out to have large reserves of understanding and humanity . In the brighter light of the seaward side of the house she looked extremely well , happy , her face tanned and smooth . On her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arm , a heavy gold chain on her neck . She had aged a little  --  she must be thirty-eight or thirtynine , was his guess , but her dark , close-set eyes , which gave her a fluid and merged gaze ( she had a delicate , lovely nose ) , were clearer than he had ever seen them . She was in the time of life when the later action of heredity begins , the blemishes of ancestors appear  --  a spot , or the deepening of wrinkles , at first increasing a woman 's beauty . Death , the artist , very slow , putting in his first touches . Now to Sissler it could n't matter less . He had already acceptedthis , would rumble on in his Russian accent , and be the same forthright businessman to the day of his death . When that moment came , because of his bunchy back hair , he would have to die lying on his side . Ideas that depopulate the world . But as Herzog accepted a drink , and heard himself in a clear voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chintz-covered  --  95  --  chair , his psychological reading suggested that it might not be Sissler whose deathbed he saw in this vision , but some other person who had a wife . Maybe it was even himself who was dying in fantasy . He had had a wife  --  two wives  --  and been the object of such death-flavored fantasies himself . Now : the first requirement of stability in a human being was that the said human being should really desire to exist . This is what Spinoza says . It is necessary for happiness ( felicitas ) . He ca n't behave well ( bene agere ) , or live well ( bene vivere ) , if he himself does n't want to live . But if it 's also natural , as psychology says , to kill mentally ( one thought-murder a day keeps the psychiatrist away ) , then the desire to exist is not steady enough to support a good life . Do I want to exist , or want to die ? But at this social moment he could n't expect to answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinking glass instead . The whisky went down , burning pleasurably in his chest like a tangled string of fire . Below he saw the pock-marked beach , and flaming sunset on the water . The ferry was returning . As the sun went down , its wide hull suddenly filled with electric lights . In the calm sky a helicopter steered toward Hyannis Port , where the Kennedys lived . Big doings there , once . The power of nations . What do we know about it ? Moses felt a sharp pang at the thought of the late President . ( I wonder what I would say to a President in actual conversation . ) He smiled a little as he remembered his mother boasting to Aunt Zipporah about him . " What a little tongue it has . Moshele could talk to the President . " But at that time the President was Harding . Or was it Coolidge ? Meantime the conversation was going on . Sissler was trying to make Moses feel at home  --  I must seem obviously shook up  --  and Libbie looked concerned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Moses . " I 'm just a little excitedby things . " He laughed . Libbie and Sissler exchanged a look , but grew easier . " This is a fine house you have . Is it rented ? " " I own it , " said Sissler . " Is that so . Wonderful place . Summer only , is n't it ? You could winterize it easily . " " It would cost fifteen grand , or more , " said Sissler . " That much ? I suppose labor and materials are higher on this island . " : 96 : " I could do the work myself , sure , " said Sissler . " But we come here to rest . I understand you 're a property owner , too . " " Ludeyville , Mass , " said Herzog . " Where is that ? " " Berkshires . Near the Connecticut corner of the state . " " Must be a beautiful spot of country . " " Oh , it 's beautiful all right . Too remote , though . Far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps Sissler thought the liquor would calm him . " Moses probably wants to clean up after his trip , " said Libbie . " I 'll show him his room . " Sissler carried Herzog 's valise up . " This is a fine old staircase , " said Moses . " Could n't duplicate it today for thousands . They put a lot of work into it , for a summer house . " " Sixty years ago they still had craftsmen , " said Sissler . " Take a look at the doors  --  bird's-eye maple . Here 's where you are . I think you got everything here  --  towels , soap . Some neighbors are comingthis evening . One single lady . A singer . Miss Elisa Thurnwald . Divorced . " The room was wide and comfortable , and had a view of the bay . The bluish beacons of the two points , East and West Chop , were lighted . " This is a fine spot , " said Herzog . " Unpack . Make yourself at home . Do n't be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good friend to Libbie when she was up against it . She told me how you protected her from that blowtop , Erikson . He even tried to stab the poor kid . She did n't have anybody but you to turn to . " " As a matter of fact , Erikson had nobody else to turn to , either . " " What 's the diff ? " Sissler said , with his rugged face a little averted but only so that his small shrewd eyes might see Herzog from the angle required for the fullest consideration . " You stood up for her . To me that 's everything . Not just because I love the kid , either , but because there 's so many creeps in circulation . You got trouble , I can see that . Jumping out of your skin . You got a soul:97 : have n't you , Moses . " He shook his head , smoking his cigarette with two stained fingers pressed to his mouth , his voice rumbling . " Ca n't dump the sonofabitch , can we ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low voice . " I 'm not even sure I 've got the thing still . " " I would say yes . Well . . . " He turned his wrist to catch the last of the light on his gold watch . " You got time to rest up a little . " He left , and Moses lay on the bed a while  --  a good mattress , a clean comforter . He lay for a quarter of an hour without thinking , lips parted , legs and arms extended , breathing quietly as he gazed at the figures of the wallpaper until they were hidden in darkness . When he stood up it was not to wash and dress but to write a farewellnote on the maple desk . There was stationery in the drawer . Have to go back . Not able to stand kindness at this time . Feelings , heart , everything in strange condition . Unfinished business . Bless you both . And much happiness . Toward end of summer , perhaps , if you will give me a rain check . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Sisslers were in the kitchen . Sissler was making a clatter with the ice trays . Moses rapidly descended and was out of the screen door with frantic swiftness , softly . He passed through the bushes into the neighboring lot . Up the path , and back to the ferry slip . He took a cab to the airport . All he could get at this hour was a Boston flight . He took it and caught a plane for Idlewild at Boston airport . At eleven P.m. he was lying in his own bed , drinking warm milk and eating a peanut-butter sandwich . It had cost him a pretty penny , all of this travel . He kept Geraldine Portnoy 's letter always on his bed table , and he picked it up now and reread it before he fell asleep . He tried to remember how he had felt when he had first read it , in Chicago , after some delay . Dear Mr. Herzog , I am Geraldine Portnoy , Lucas Asphalter 's friend . You may remember . . . . May remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  progressive-school printing turned cursive and the i 's dotted with curious little open circles ) , trying to swallow the whole letter at once , turning the pages to see whether the gist of the thing was underscored anywhere . Actually I took your course in Romantics as Social Philosophers . We differed about:98 : Rousseau and Karl Marx . I have come around to your view , that Marx expressed metaphysical hopes for the future of mankind . I took what he said about materialism far too literally . My view ! It 's common , and why does she want to make me dangle like this  --  why does n't she get on with it ? He had tried again to find the point , but all those circular open dots fell on his vision like snow and masked the message . You probably never noticed me , but I liked you , and as a friend of Lucas Asphalter  --  he just adores you , he says you are just a feast of the most human qualities  --  I have of course heard a lot about you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how you played basketball in the Boys ' Brotherhood of the Republic , in the good old Chicago days on Division Street . An uncle of mine by marriage was one of the coaches  --  Jules Hankin . I think I do recall Hankin . He wore a blue cardigan , and parted his hair in the middle . I do n't want you to get me wrong . I do n't want to meddle in your affairs . And I am not an enemy of Madeleine 's . I sympathize with her , too . She is so vivacious , intelligent , and such a charmer , and has been so warm and frank with me . For quite a while , I admired her and as a younger woman was very pleased by her confidences . Herzog flushed . Her confidences would include his sexual disgrace . And as a former student , I was of course intriguedto hear of your private life , but was also surprised by her freedom and willingness to talk , and soon saw she wanted to win me over , for some reason . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then any intense feeling between members of the same sex is often , and unjustly , under suspicion . My scientific background has taught me to make more cautious generalizations , and resist this creeping psychoanalysis of ordinary conduct . But she did want to win me to her side , although far too subtle to pour it on , as they say . She told me that you had very fine human and intellectual qualities , though neurotic and with an intolerable temper which often frightened her . However , she added , you could be great , and after two bad , loveless marriages perhaps you would devote yourself to the work you were meant to do . Emotional relationshipsyou were not really good at . It was soon obvious that she would never have given herself to a man who lacked distinction of intelligence or feeling . Madeleine said that for the first time in her life she knew clearly what she was doing . Until now it was all  --  99confusion and there were even gaps of time she could n't account for . In marrying you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for a certain break . It is extremely exciting to talk with her , she gives a sense of a significant encounter  --  with life  --  a beautiful , brilliant person with a fate of her own . Her experiencesare rich , or pregnant . . . . What is this ? Herzog had thought . Is she going to tell me that Madeleine is going to have a child ? Gersbach 's child ! No ! How wonderful  --  what luck for me . If she has a kid out of wedlock , I can petition for Junie 's custody . Eagerly , he had devoured the rest of the page , turned over . No , Madeleine was not pregnant . She 'd be far too clever to let that happen . She owed her survival to intelligence . It was part of her sickness to be shrewd . She was not pregnant , then . I was not merely a graduate student who helped with the child , but a confidante . Your little girl is greatly attached to me , and I find her a most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with more than the usual affection , oh far more , than one has for the children one meets in this way . I understand the Italians are supposedto be the most child-oriented culture in the West ( judge by the figure of the Christ child in Italian painting ) , but obviously Americans have their own craze about child psychology . Everythingis done for children , ostensibly . To be fair , I think Madeleine is not bad with little June , basically . She tends to be authoritarian . Mr. Gersbach , who has an ambiguous position in this household , is very amusing to the child , on the whole . She calls him Uncle Val , and I often see him giving her a piggyback , or tossing her in the air . Here Herzog had set his teeth , angry , scenting danger . But I have to report one disagreeable thing , and I talked this over with Lucas . This is that , coming to Harper Avenue the other night , I heard the child crying . She was inside Gersbach 's car , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing was shaking and weeping . I thought she had shut herself in while playing , but it was after dark , and I did n't understand why she would be outside , alone , at bedtime . Herzog 's heart had pounded with dangerous thick beats at these words . I had to calm her , and then I found out that her Mama and Uncle Val were having a quarrel inside , and Uncle Val had taken her by the hand and led her out to the car , and told her to play a while . He shut her up and went back in the house . I can see him : I o o : mount the stairs while Junie screams in fright . I 'll kill him for that  --  so help me , if I do n't ! He reread the concluding lines . Luke says you have a right to know such things . He was going to phone but I felt it would be upsetting and harmful to hear this over the phone . A letter gives one a chance to consider  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't think Madeleine is a bad mother , actually. : 1 0 1 : E was at his letter-writingagain in the morning . The little desk at the window was black , rivaling the blackness of his fire escape , those rails dipped in asphalt , a heavy cosmetic coat of black , rails equidistant but appearingaccording to the rules of perspective . He had letters to write . He was busy , busy , in pursuit of objects he was only now , and dimly , beginning to understand . His first message today , begun halfconsciouslyas he was waking up , was to Monsignor Hilton , the priest who had brought Madeleine into the Church . Sipping his black coffee , Herzog in his cotton paisley robe narrowed his eyes and cleared his throat , already aware of the anger , the pervasive indignation he felt . The Monsignor should know what effect he had on the people he tampered with . I am the husband , or exhusband , of a young woman whom you converted , Madeleine Pontritter , the daughter of the well-known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you some years ago and was baptized by you . A recent Radcliffe graduate , and very beautiful . . . . Was Madeleine really such a great beauty , or did the loss of her make him exaggerate  --  did it make his suffering more notable ? Did it console him that a beautiful woman had dumped him ? But she had done it for that loud , flamboyant , ass-clutching brute Gersbach . Nothing can be done about the sexual preferences of women . That 's ancient wisdom . Nor of men . Quite objectively , however , she was a beauty . So was Daisy , in her time . I myself was once handsome , but spoiled my looks with conceit . . . Her complexionhealthy and pink , fine dark hair gathered in a bun behind and a fringe on her forehead , a slender neck , heavy blue eyes and a Byzantine nose which came straight down from the brow . The bangs concealed a forehead of considerable intellectual power , the will of a demon , or else outright mental disorder . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to take instruction she bought crosses and medals and rosaries , and suitable clothes . But then , she was just a girl , really , just out of college . Still , I believe she understood many things better than I. And I want you to know , Monsignor , that I am not writing with the purpose of exposing Madeleine , or:IO2 : attacking you . I simply believe you may be interested to find out what may happen , or actually does happen , when people want to save themselves from . . . I suppose the word is nihilism . Now then , what does happen ? What actually did happen ? Herzogtried to understand , staring at the brick walls to which he had fled again from the Vineyard . I had that room in Philadelphia  --  that one-year job  --  and I was commuting to New York three or four times a week on the Pennsylvania train , to visit Marco . Daisy swore there would be no divorce . And , for a time , I was shacked up with Sono Oguki , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . I was n't getting much work done . Routine classes in Philadelphia . They were bored with me , and I with them . Papa got wind of my dissolute life , and was angry . Daisy wrote him all about it , but it was none of Papa 's business . What actually happened ? I gave up the shelter of an orderly , purposeful , lawful existence because it bored me , and I felt it was simply a slacker 's life . Sono wanted me to move in with her . But I thought that would make me a squaw man . So I took my papers and books , and my Remington office machine with the black hood , and my records and oboe and music down to Philadelphia . Dragging back and forth on the train , wearing himself out  --  the best sacrifice he could offer . He went to visit his little boy , and faced the anger of his ex-wife . Daisy would try to be stolid . It did great harm to her looks . She met Moses at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself into a square figure with green eyes and chopped hair , waiting to say he must bring Marco home within two hours . He had a horror of these meetings . Of course she always knew exactly what he was doing , whom he was seeing , and now and then would say , " How 's Japan ? " or " How 's the Pope ? " It was not funny . She had good qualities , but a sense of humor was not among them . Moses prepared for his outings with Marco . The time passed heavily otherwise . On the train he memorized facts about the Civil War  --  dates , names , battles  --  so that while Marco was eating his hamburger at the Zoo Cafeteria , where they always went , they could talk . " Now it 's time to tell you about Beauregard , " he said . " This part is very exciting . " But Herzog could only try to fix his mind on General Beauregard or on Island Number 10 or Andersonville . He was thinking how to deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it felt like a desertion . The woman was waiting for him to call ; he knew that . And he was often tempted , when Madeleine was too busy with the Church and re- fused to see him , to drop in and have a talk , nothing more , with Sono . This confusion was ugly , and he despised himself for creat- ing it . Was this all the work a man could find to do ? Losing self-respect ! Lacking clear ideas ! He could see that Marco sympathized with his confused father , He played the game with Moses , asking more questions about the Civil War simply because it was all that he had to offer . The child would not reject his well-meant gift . There was love in that , thought Herzog , wrapped in his paisley cotton , his coffee turning cold . These children and I love one another . But what can I give them ? Marco would look at him with clear eyes , his pale child 's face , the Herzog face , freckled , his hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had his Grandmother Herzog 's mouth . " Well , okay , kid , I 've got to go back to Philadelphia now , " said Herzog . He felt , on the contrary , nothing necessary about this return to Philadelphia . Philadelphia was entirely a mistake . What need was there to ride that train ? Was it necessary , for in- stance , to see Elizabeth and Trenton ? Were they waiting for him to look at them ? Was his single cot in Philadelphia expecting him ? " It 's just about train time , Marco . " He pulled out his pocket watch , a gift twenty years ago from his father . " Take care on the subway . And around the neighborhood , too . Do n't go down into Morning- side Park . There are gangs down there . " He repressed the impulse to dial Sono Oguki 's number from a sidewalk booth and got on the subway instead , which carried him to Penn Station . In his long brown coat , tight in the shoulders and misshapen by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underground tunnel of shops  --  flowers , cutlery , whisky , doughnuts and grilled sausages , the waxy chill of the orangeade . Laboriously he climbed into the light-filled vault of the station , the great win- dows dustily dividing the autumn sun  --  the stoop-shouldered sun of the garment district . The mirror of the gum machine revealed to Herzog how pale he was , unhealthy  --  wisps from his coat and wool scarf , his hat and brows , twisting and flaming outward in the overfull light and exposing the sphere of his face , the face of a man who was keeping up a front . Herzog smiled at this earlier ava- tar of his life , at Herzog the victim , Herzog the would-be lover , Herzog the man on whom the world depended for certain intellectualwork , to change history , to influence the development of civilization . Several boxes of stale paper under his bed in Philadelphiawere going to produce this very significant result . So , by the expanding iron gate with its crimson plaque , lettered in gold , Herzog holding his unpunched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragging . Ghosts of an old physical pride were still about him . On the lower level the cars , smoky red , were waiting . Was he coming or going ? At times he did n't know . The books in his pockets were Pratt 's short history of the Civil War and several volumes of Kierkegaard . Although he had given up tobacco , Herzog was still drawn to the smoker . He liked the fumes . Sitting in a dirty plush seat he took out a book and read For dying means that it is all over , but dying the death means to experience death , trying to think what this might signify . If . . . Yes . . . No . . . on the other hand , if existence is nausea then faith is an uncertain relief . Or else  --  be demolished by suffering and you will feel the power of God as he restores you . Fine reading for a depressive ! Herzog , at his desk , smiled . He let his head fall into his hands , almost silently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , totally serious . All who live are in despair . ( ? ) And that is the sickness unto death . ( ? ) It is that a man refuses to be what he is . ( ? ) He closed the book as the train reached the junk heaps of New Jersey . His head was hot . He found coolness by pressing the large Stevenson button on his lapel to his cheek . The smoke in the car was sweet , rotten , rich . He sucked it deep into his lungs  --  a stirringfoulness ; he raptly breathed in the swampiness of old pipes . The wheels were speeding with a sharp racket , biting the rails . The cold fall sun flamed over the New Jersey mills . Volcanic shapes of slag , rushes , dumps , refineries , ghostly torches , and presently the fields and woods . The short oaks bristled like metal . The fields turned blue . Each radio spire was like a needle 's eye with a drop of blood in it . The dull bricks of Elizabeth fell behind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire . Herzog read the municipal Sign  --  TRENTON MAKES , THE WORLD TAKES ! At nightfall , in a cold electric glitter , came Philadelphia . Poor fellow , his health was not good . . Ioc . Herzog was grinning as he thought of the pills he had taken , and the milk he had drunk in the night . By his bed in Philadelphiathere often stood a dozen bottles . He sipped milk to calm his stomach . Living amid great ideas and concepts , insufficiently relevant to the present , day-by-day , American conditions . You see , Monsignor , if you stand on television in the ancient albs and surplices of the Roman church there are at least enough Irishmen , Poles , Croatians watching in saloons to understand you , lifting elegant arms to heaven and glancing your eyes like a silent movie star  --  Richard Barthelmess or Conway Tearle ; the R.C. working class takes great pride in him . But I , a learned specialist in intellectual history , handicapped by emotional confusion . . . Resisting the argument that scientific thought has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Convinced that the extent of universal space does not destroy human value , that the realm of facts and that of values are not eternally separated . And the peculiar idea entered my ( Jewish ) mind that we 'd see about this ! My life would prove a different point altogether . Very tired of the modern form of historicism which sees in this civilization the defeat of the best hopes of Western religion and thought , what Heidegger calls the second Fall of Man into the quotidian or ordinary . No philosopher knows what the ordinary is , has not fallen into it deeply enough . The question of ordinary human experience is the principal questionof these modern centuries , as Montaigne and Pascal , otherwisein disagreement , both clearly saw .  --  The strength of a man 's virtue or spiritual capacity measured by his ordinary life . One way or another the no doubt mad idea entered my mind that my own actions had historic importance , and this ( fantasy ? ) made it appear that people who harmed me were interfering with an important experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopeful lunatic , tipping the carton to quiet his stomach and drown his unquiet mind , courting sleep . He was thinking of Marco , Daisy , Sono Oguki , Madeleine , the Pontritters , and now and then of the difference between ancient and modern tragedy according to Hegel , the inner experience of the heart and the deepening of individual character in the modern age . His own individual char-. ro6. acter cut off at times both from facts and from values . But moderncharacter is inconstant , divided , vacillating , lacking the stonelikecertitude of archaic man , also deprived of the firm ideas of the seventeenth century , clear , hard theorems . Moses wanted to do what he could to improve the human condition , at last taking a sleeping pill , to preserve himself . In the best interests of everyone . But when he met his Philadelphia class in the morning , he could hardly see his lecture notes . His eyes were swollen and his head asleep , but his anxious heart beat faster than ever . Madeleine 's father , a powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grotesque vanities of theatrical New York in him , however , told me I might do her a great deal of good . He said , " Well , it 's about time she quit hanging around with queers . She 's like a lot of bluestocking college girls  --  all her friends are homosexuals . She 's got more faggots at her feet than Joan of Arc . It 's a good sign that she 's interested in you . " But the old man also thought him a poor fish . That psychological fact was not concealed . He had come to see Pontritter in his studio  --  Madeleine had said , " My father insists on having a talk with you . I wish you 'd stop in . " He found Pontritter dancing the samba or the cha-cha ( Herzog did n't know one from the other ) with his own instructress , a middle-aged Filipino woman who had once belonged to a wellknowntango team ( Ramon and Adelina ) . Adelina had put on weight in the middle , but her long legs were thin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pontritter , this immense figure of a man with single white fibers growing from his tanned scalp ( he used a sun lamp all winter ) was making tiny steps in his canvas , rope-soled slippers . His seat-fallen trousers moved from side to side as he swayed his wide hips . His blue eyes were severe . The music played , sucking and knocking , tiny , rapping , scraping steel-band rhythms . When it stopped , Pontritter said with somewhatdistant interest , " You Moses Herzog ? " " That 's right . " " In love with my daughter ? " " Yes . " " It is n't doing much for your health , I see . " " I have n't been too well , Mr. Pontritter. " : 107 : " Everyone calls me Fitz . This is Adelina . Adelina  --  Moses . He 's laying my daughter . I thought I 'd never live to see the day . Well , congratulations . . . Hope Sleeping Beauty will wake up . " " ' Allo , guapo , " said Adelina . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes were concentrated on the lighting of her cigarette . She took a match from Pontritter 's hand . Herzog rememberedthinking how purely external that match game was , under the studio skylight . Artificial heat or none at all . Later in the day , he had a talk with Tennie Pontritter , too . As Tennie spoke of her daughter , tears quickly came to her eyes . She had a smooth , long-suffering countenance , slightly tearful even when she smiled , and most mournful when you met her by chance , as Moses did on Broadway , and saw her face  --  she was above the average height  --  coming toward him , large , smooth , kindly , with permanent creases of suffering beside her mouth . She invited him to sit with her in Verdi Square , the tattered grass plot railed in and always surrounded by a seated throng of dying old men and women , and by begging cripples , lesbians swaggering like truck drivers and fragile Negro homosexuals with dyed hair and earrings . " I do n't have much influence with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her dearly , of course . It has n't been easy . I had to stand by Fitz . He was blacklisted for years . I could n't be disloyal . After all , he is a great artist . . . . " " I believe it . . . . " Herzog muttered . She had waited for him to accept this . " He 's a giant , " said Tennie . She had learned to say such things with utter conviction . Only a Jewish woman of a good , **27;5614;TOOLONG  --  her father had been a tailor and a member of the Arbeiter-Ring , a Yiddishist  --  could sacrifice her life to a great artist as she had done . " In a mass society ! " she said . She looked at him still with the same sisterly gentleness and appeal . " A money society ! " He wondered at this . Madeleine had told him , very bitter toward her parents , that the old man needed fifty thousand a year , and that he got it , too , the old Svengali , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks I let her down . She does n't understand  --  hates her father . I can tell you this , Moses , I think people must trust you instinctively . I see that Mady does , . io8. and she 's not a trusting girl . So I think she must be in love with you . " I am , with her , " said Moses , emotionally . " You must love her  --  I think you do . . . . Things are so com-plicated . " " That I 'm older  --  married ? Is that what you mean ? " " You wo n't hurt her , will you ? No matter what she thinks , I am her mother . I have a mother 's heart , whatever she says . " She began crying , softly . " Oh , Mr. Herzog . . . I 'm always between the two of them . I know we have n't been conventional parents . She feels I just turned her out into the world . And there 's nothing I can do . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child the only thing that can help her . " Tennie took off her elaborate glasses , now making no effort to disguise her weeping . Her face , her nose reddened , and her eyes , shaped to make what seemed to Moses a crooked appeal , darkened blindly with tears . There was a measure of hypocrisy and calculation in Tennie 's method , but behind this , again , was real feeling for her daughter and her husband ; and behindthis real feeling there was something still more meaningful and somber . Herzog was all too well aware of the layers upon layers of reality  --  loathsomeness , arrogance , deceit , and then  --  God help us all !  --  truth , as well . He understood he was being manipulatedby Madeleine 's worried mother . Thirty years the bohemianwife , the platitudes of that ideology threadbare , cynically exploited by old Pontritter , Tennie remained faithful , chained in the dull silver " abstract " jewelry that she wore . But it would never happen to her daughter , if she could help it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And this was where Moses came in , on the bench in Verdi Square . His face was shaven , his shirt was clean , his nails clean , his legs , somewhat heavy in the thighs , were crossed , and he listened to Tennie very thoughtfully  --  for a man whose mind had stopped working . It was too full of his grand projects to think anything clearly . Of course he understood that Tennie was setting him up , and that he was a sucker for just the sort of appeal she made . He had a weakness for good deeds , and she flattered this weakness , asking him to save this headstrong deluded child of hers . Patience , loving-kindness , and virility would accomplish this . But Tennie flattered him even more : 109 : subtly . She was telling Moses that he could bring stability into the life of this neurotic girl and cure her by his steadiness . Among this crowd of the aged , dying , and crippled , Tennie making her appeal to Moses for his help , stirred his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I adore Madeleine , Tennie , " he said . " You do n't have to worry . I 'll do everything possible . " An eager , hasty , self-intense , and comical person . Madeleine had an apartment in an old building , and Herzog stayed with her when he was in town . They slept together on the studio sofa with the morocco cover . Moses pressed her body all night with fervor , exaltation . She was not so fervent , but then she was a recent convert . Besides , one lover is always more moved than the other . Sometimes she had tears of anger and misery in her eyes and complained of her sinfulness . Still , she wanted it , too . At seven in the morning , seeming to anticipate the alarm clock by a split second , she stiffened , and when it rang she was already exclaiming with suffocated anger , " Damn ! " and striding to the bathroom . The fixtures were old-fashioned in this place . These had been luxury apartments in the 189os . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She dropped her pajama top so that she was bare to the waist , and washed herself with a cloth , purifyingherself with angry vigor , her blue-eyed face growing red , her breasts pink . Silent , barefooted , wearing his trench coat as a robe , Herzog came in and sat on the edge of the tub , watching . The tiles were a faded cherry color , and the toothbrush rack , the fixtures , were ornate , old nickel . The water stormed from the faucet , and Herzog watched as Madeleine transformed herself into an older woman . She had a job at Fordham , and the first requirement , to her mind , was to look sober and mature , long in the Church . His open curiosity , the fact that he familiarly shared the bathroom with her , his nakedness under the trench coat , his pallid morning face in this setting of disgraced Victorian luxury  --  it all vexed her . She did not look at him while making her preparations . Over her brassiere and slip she put a high-necked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wore a plastic cape . It kept the makeup from crumbling on the wool . Now she began to apply her cosmetics  --  the bottles and powders filled the shelves above the toilet . Whatever she did , it was with unhesitatingspeed and efficiency , headlong , but with the confidence of an cxpert . Engravers , pastry cooks , acrobats on the trapeze worked in this manner . He thought she was too reckless at it  --  going too fast , about to have a spill , but that never happened . First she spread a layer of cream on her cheeks , rubbing it into her straight nose , her childish chin and soft throat . It was gray , pearly bluish stuff . That was the base . She fanned it with a towel . Over this she laid the makeup . She worked with cotton swabs , under the hairline , about the eyes , up the cheeks and on the throat . Despite the soft rings of feminine flesh , there was already something discernibly dictatorial about that extended throat . She would not let Herzog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscles . Seated , watching , on the edge of the luxurious tub , he put on his pants , tucked in his shirt . She took no notice of him ; she was trying in some way to be rid of him as her daytime life began . She put on a pale powder with her puff , still at the same tilting speed , as if desperate . Then she turned swiftly to examine the work  --  right profile , left profile  --  bracing at the mirror , holding her hands as if to support her bust but not actually touching it . She was satisfied with the powder . She put touches of Vaseline on her lids . She dyed the lashes with a tiny coil . Moses participated in all this , intensely , silently . Still without pauses or hesitations , she put a touch of black in the outer corner of each eye , and redrew the line of her brows to make it level and earnest . Then she picked up a pair of large tailor 's shears and put them to her bangs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her image was fixed in her will . She cut as if discharging a gun , and Herzog felt an impulse of alarm , short-circuited . Her decisiveness fascinated him , and in such fascination he discovered his own childishness . He , an ablebodiedperson seated on the edge of the pompous old tub , the enamel wreathed with hairlike twistings like cooked rhubarb , absorbed in this transformation of Madeleine 's face . She primed her lips with waxy stuff , then painted them a drab red , adding more years to her age . This waxen mouth just about did it . She moisteneda finger on her tongue , and brushed a few last touches on . That was it . She looked with level-browed gravity in the mirror and seemed satisfied . Yes , this was just right . She put on a long heavy tweed skirt , which hid her legs . High heels tilted her ankles slightly . And now the hat . It was gray , with a low crown , wide-brimmed . When she drew it over her sleek head she became a woman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church aisles . The wide brim over her anxious forehead , her childishintensity , her fear , her religious will  --  the pity of the whole thing ! While he , the worn , unshaven , sinful Jew , endangering her redemption  --  his heart ached . But she barely gave him a glance . She had put on the jacket with the squirrel collar and was reaching under to adjust the shoulder pads . That hat ! It was made like coil basketry of one long gray tape , about half an inch wide , like the hat worn by the Christian lady who had read the Bible with him in the hospital ward in Montreal . " The wind bloweth where it listeth , and thou hearest the sound thereof . . . . " There was even a hatpin . The job was finished . Her face was smooth and middle-aged . Only the eyeballs had n't been touched , and the tears seemed about to spring from them . She looked angry  --  furious . She wanted him there at night . She would even , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her breast as they were falling asleep . But in the morning she would have liked him to disappear . And he was not used to this ; he was used to being a favorite . But he was dealing with a new female generation , that was what he told himself . To her he was a fatherly , graying , patient seducer ( he could not believe it ! ) . But the parts had been distributed . She had her white convert 's face and Herzog could n't refuse to play opposite . " You should have some breakfast , " he said . " No . It 'll make me late . " The pastes had dried on her skin . She put on a big pectoral cross . She had been a Catholic for only three months , and already because of Herzog she could n't be confessed , not by Monsignor , anyway . Conversion was a theatrical event for Madeleine . Theater  --  the art of upstarts , opportunists , would-be aristocrats . Monsignor himself was an actor . One role , but a fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the social climbing were more important . You are famous for converting celebrities , and she went to you . Nothing but the best for our Mady . The Jewish interpretation of the high-minded Christian lady or gentleman is a curious chapter in the history of social theater . The Dignities continually replenished from below . Where would any distinguished person come from , if not the masses ? With the devotion and fire of transcendentresentment . I do n't deny that it did much for me as well . It reflected very favorably on me to be involved in such an issue . " You 'll get sick going to work on an empty stomach . Have breakfast with me and I 'll pay your cab fare out to Fordham . " Decisively , but awkwardly , she left the bathroom , her stride hampered by the long ugly skirt . She wanted to fly , but with the cartwheel hat , the tweeds , the religious medals , the large pectoralcross , her heavy heart , getting off the ground was not easy . He trailed her through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gilt , green , and red . The doorknobs and locks were immobilized by many coats of paint . Madeleine tugged , impatiently . Herzog coming up behind her jerked open the white front door . They went down a corridor where bags of garbage were put out on the once luxurious carpet , and down in the decayed elevator , out of the trapped air of the black shaft into the porphyry facade of the moldy lobby , into the crowded street . " Are n't you coming ? What are you doing ? " said Madeleine . Perhaps he was not yet fully awake . Herzog was loitering for a moment near the fish store , arrested by the odor . A thin muscular Negro was pitching buckets of ground ice into the deep window . The fish were packed together , backs arched as if they were swimming in the crushed , smoking ice , bloody bronze , slimy blackgreen , gray-gold  --  the lobsters were crowded to the glass , feelers bent . The morning was warm , gray , damp , fresh , smelling of the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Moses received the raised pattern of the steel through his thin shoe soles ; like Braille . But he did not interpret a message . The fish were arrested , lifelike , in the white , frothing , ground ice . The street was overcast , warm and gray , intimate , unclean , flavored by the pollutedriver , the sexually stirring brackish tidal odor . " I ca n't wait for you , Moses , " said Madeleine , peremptory , over her shoulder . They went into the restaurant and sat at the yellow formica table . " What were you dawdling for ? " " Well , my mother came from the Baltic provinces . She loved fish . " But Madeleine was not to be interested in Mother Herzog , twenty years dead , however mother-bound this nostalgic gentleman'ssoul might be . Moses , thinking , ruled against himself . He was a fatherly person to Madeleine  --  he could n't expect her to consider his mother . She was one of the dead dead , without effect on the new generation . On the yellow-plated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blossom in a metal holder , or choker , sunk to the neck . Curious to know whether it was plastic too , Herzog touched it . Finding it real , he quickly drew back his fingers . Madeleine was watching . " You know I 'm in a hurry , " she said . She was fond of English muffins . He ordered them . She called after the waitress , " Tear mine . Please do n't slice them . " She tilted her chin to Moses , then , and said , " Moses , is my makeup on all right  --  on my neck ? " " With your complexion , you do n't need any of this . " " But is it ragged ? " " No . Am I going to see you later ? " " I 'm not sure . I 've been invited for cocktails out at Fordhamforone of the missionaries . " " But afterwards  --  I can catch a late train to Philly . " " I promised Mother . . . . She 's having trouble again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all settled  --  divorce . " " She 's such a slave ! " said Madeleine . " She ca n't let go , and neither will he . It 's to his advantage . She still goes to that rotten acting school after hours and keeps his books . He 's the great thing in her life  --  another Stanislaysky . She sacrificed herself and if he 's not a great genius what was it all for ! Therefore he is a great genius . . . . " " I 've heard people say what a brilliant director he was . " " He has something , " said Madeleine . " Almost a female kind of insight . And he drugs people  --  it 's evil the way he does it . Tenniesays he spends about fifty thousand a year just on himself alone . He uses all his genius to burn that money . " " It sounds to me as though she 's keeping his books for your sake  --  trying to save what she can for you . " " He 'll leave nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set her teeth in the toasted muffin  --  they were girlish , short . But then , she:II4 : did not eat . She put the muffin down , and her eyes filled in their strange manner . " What 's wrong ? Eat . " She pushed away the plate , however . " I 've asked you not to phone me , up at Fordham . It upsets me . I have to keep the two things separate . " " I 'm sorry . I wo n't . " " I 've been beside myself . I 'm ashamed to go to Monsignor for confession . " " Wo n't another priest do ? " She put down her cup with a sharp crack of clumsy restaurant china . A pale lipstick mark was on the rim . " The last priest bawled hell out of me about you . He asked how long had I been in the Church ? Why was I baptized if I was going to act like this within a few months ! " The great eyes of the middle-aged woman she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white face were the straight brows she had given herself . He thought he could see the true outline beneath . " God ! I 'm sorry , " said Moses . He looked contrite . " I do n't want to make trouble . " This was certainly untrue . On the contrary , he was bent on making trouble . He thought difficulty was the whole object . She wanted Moses and the Monsignor to struggle over her . It heightened the sexual excitement . He fought her apostasyin the sack . And certainly the Monsignor made female convertswith his burning eyes . " I feel miserable  --  miserable , " she said . " It 'll be Ash Wednesdaysoon , and I ca n't take Communion till I confess . " " That 's awkward . . . . " Moses really did sympathize with her , but he would n't offer to bow out . " And what about marriage ? How can we marry ? " " Things can be worked out  --  the Church is a wise old institu-tion . " " At the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry Marilyn Monroe . And the Tyrone Power case  --  one of his last marriages was performed by a prince of the Church . The other day there was another thing in Leonard Lyons about Catholicdivorces . " Madeleine read all the gossip columnists . Her bookmarksin St. Augustine and in her missal were clippings from the Post and Mirror. : 115 : " Favorable ? " asked Moses , doubling his muffin over and pressingit  --  it was buttered too thickly . Madeleine 's large , violet eyes seemed swollen . Her thoughts were strained with these difficulties , many times analyzed . " I have an appointment with an Italian priest in the Society for the Propagationof the Faith . He 's a canon-law expert . I phoned him yester-day . " In the Church twelve weeks , she already knew everything . " It would be easier if Daisy would divorce me , " said Herzog . " She 's got to give you a divorce . " Madeleine 's voice rose sharply . Herzog found himself looking at the face which had been prepared for the Jesuits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had tightened and twisted in her breast , and her figure grew rigid . Her fingertips whitened as she pressed the edge of the table and glared at him , her lips thinning and the color darkening under the tubercular pallor of her makeup . " What makes you think I intend to have a lifelong affair with you ? I want some ac-tion . " " But Mady  --  you know how I feel . . . . " " Feel ? Do n't give me that line of platitudes about feelings . I do n't believe in it . I believe in God  --  sin  --  death  --  so do n't pull any sentimental crap on me . " " No  --  now listen . " He put on his fedora , as if he hoped to derivesome authority from it . " I want to be married , " she said . " This other stuff is just balls ! My mother had to live a bohemian life . She worked , while Pontrittercarried on . He bribed me with nickels when I saw him with one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ? From Lenin 's State and Revolution . Those people are insane ! " Probably so , Herzog mentally agreed . But now Madeleine wants white Christmases and Easter bunnies and to live perhaps in one of those streets of brick , semi-detached parochial houses in the dull wilderness of Queens borough , fussing over Communion dresses , with a steady Irish husband who sweeps up the crumbs at the biscuit factory . " Maybe I have become a fanatic about conventional things , " said Madeleine . " But I wo n't have it any other way . You and I have got to marry in the Church , otherwise I quit . Our children.116. will be baptized and brought up in the Church . " Moses gave a dumb half-nod . Compared with her he felt static , without temperament . The powdered fragrance of her face stirred him ( my gratitude for art , was his present reflection , any sort of art ) . " My childhood was a grotesque nightmare , " she went on . " I was bullied , assaulted , ab-ab-ab . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded . She had told him this before . He could not bring this sexual secret of hers to light . " It was a grown man , " she said . " He paid me to keep it quiet " " Who was he ? " Her eyes were sullenly full and her pretty mouth desperately vengeful but silent . " It happens to many , many people , " he said . " Ca n't base a whole life on that . It does n't mean that much . " " What  --  a whole year of amnesia not mean much ? My fourteenthyear is blacked out . " She could n't accept this broad-minded consolation from Herzog . Perhaps it seemed to her a kind of indifference . " My parents damn near destroyed me . All right  --  it does n't matter now , " she said . " I believe in my Savior , Jesus Christ . I 'm not afraid of d-death now , Moses . Pon said we all died and rotted in the grave . Saying that to a girl of six or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But now I 'm willing to go on living , and to bring children into the world , providedthat I have something to tell them when they ask me about death and the grave . But do n't expect me to go along in the ordinaryloose way  --  without rules . No ! It 'll be these rules or nothing . " Moses watched her as though he were submerged , through the vitreous distortion of deep water . " Do you hear me ? " " Oh , yes , " he said . " Yes . I do . " " I 've got to go now . Father Francis is never a minute late . " She picked up her handbag and hurried away , her cheeks shaken by the abruptness of her steps . She wore very high heels . Rushing into the subway on one of those mornings , she caught a heel in the hem of her skirt and fell , injuring her back . She limped up to the street and took a taxi to the office but Father Francis sent her to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go home . There she found Moses , still half dressed , having a thoughtful cup of coffee ( he was thinking continually , but nothingclear resulted ) . " Help me ! " Madeleine said . " What happened ? " " I fell in the subway . I 'm hurt . " Her voice was piercing . " You 'd better lie down , " he said . He unpinned her hat , and carefullyunbuttoned her jacket and sweater , took off her skirt and slip . The clear , pink color of her body was disclosed below the makeup line at the base of her neck . He took off the pectoral cross . " Get me pajamas . " She was shivering . The broad tapes had a strongly medicated smell . He led her to the bed and lay down with/ her to warm and comfort her , just as she wanted him to . There was a March snow , that grimy day . He did not go back to Philadelphia . " I punished myself for my sins , " Madeleine repeated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of one of your converts , Monsignor . Ecclesiastical dolls  --  gold-threaded petticoats , whining organ pipes . The actual world , to say nothing of the infinite universe , demanded a sterner , a real masculine character . Like whose ? thought Herzog . Mine , for instance ? And , instead of concluding this letter to Monsignor , he wrote out , for his own use , one of June 's favorite nursery rhymes . I love little pussy , her coat is so warmAnd if I do n't hurt her , she 'll do me no harm . I 'll sit by the fire and give her some food , And pussy will love me because I am good . That 's more like it , he thought . Yes . You must aim the imaginationalso at yourself , point-blank . But when all was said and done , Madeleine did n't marry in the Church , nor did she baptize her daughter . Catholicism went the way of zithers and tarot cards , bread-baking and Russian civilization . And life in the country . With Madeleine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . For a big-city Jew he was peculiarly devoted to.ii8 : country life . He had forced Daisy to endure a freezing winter in eastern Connecticut while he was writing Romanticism and Christianity , in a cottage where the pipes had to be thawed with candles and freezing blasts penetrated the clapboard walls while Herzog brooded over his Rousseau or practiced on the oboe . The instrumenthad been left to him at the death of Aleck Hirshbein , his roommate at Chicago , and Herzog with his odd sense of piety ( much heavy love in Herzog ; grief did not pass quickly , with him ) taught himself to play the instrument and , come to think of it , the sad music must have oppressed Daisy even more than the months of cold fog . Perhaps Marco 's character had been affected by the experience , too ; at times he showed a streak of melancholy . But with Madeleine it was going to be altogether different . She dropped from the Church and after a struggle with Daisy and her lawyers and his own , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and remarried . The wedding supper was cooked by Phoebe Gersbach . Herzog , at his desk , gazing at great scrolls of cloud ( the sky unusually clear for New York ) , remembered the Yorkshire pudding and the home-made cake . Phoebe baked incomparable banana cakes , light , moist , white icing . A doll bride and groom . And Gersbach , boisterous , yucking it up , poured whisky , wine , pounded the table , danced , stumping , with the bride . He wore one of his favorite loose sports shirts , which opened on his big chest and slipped away from his shoulderssoftly . Male decollete . There were no other guests . The house in Ludeyville was bought when Madeleine became pregnant . It seemed the ideal place to work out the problems Herzog had become involved with in The Phenomenology of Mind  --  the importance of the " law of the heart " in Western traditions , the origins of moral sentimentalism and related matters , on which he had distinctly different ideas . He was going  --  he smiled secretly now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull the carpet from under all other scholars , show them what was what , stun them , expose their triviality once and for all . It was not simple vanity , but a sense of responsibility that was the underlying motive . That he would say for himself . He was a bien pensant type . He took seriously Heinrich Heine 's belief that the words of Rousseau had turned into the bloody machine of Robespierre , that Kant and Fichte were deadlier than armies . He had a small foundation grant , : 1 1 9 : tand his twenty-thousand-dollar legacy from Father Herzog went into the country place . He turned into its caretaker . Twenty thousand and more would have gone down the drain if he had n't thrown himself into the work  --  Papa 's savings , representing forty years of misery in Amer- ica . I do n't understand how it was possible , thought Herzog . I was in a fever when I wrote the check . I did n't even look . But after the papers were signed he inspected the house as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloomy , with rotting Victorian ornaments . Nothing on the ground floor but a huge hole like a shell crater . The plaster was coming down  --  moldy , thready , sickening stuff hung from the laths . The old fashioned knob-and-tube wirin , , was dangerous . Bricks were dropping from the foundations . The windows leaked . Herzog learned masonry , glazing , plumbing . He sat up nights studying the Do-It-Yourself Encyclopedia , and with hysterical pas- sion he painted , patched , tarred gutters , plastered holes . Two coats of paint counted for nothing on old , open-grained wood . In the bathroom the nails had n't been set and their heads worked through the vinyl tiles , which came loose like playing cards . The gas radiator was suffocating . The electric heater blew fuses . The tub was a relic ; it rested on four metal talons , toylike . You had to crouch in it and sponge yourself . Still , Madeleine had come back from Sloane 's Bath Shop with luxurious fixtures , scallop-shell sil- ver soap dishes and bars of Ecusson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rusty slime of the toilet tank , trying to get the cock and ball to work . At night he heard the trickle that was exhausting the well . A year of work saved the house from collapse . In the cellar was another lavatory with thick walls like a bunker . In summer the crickets liked it best , and so did Herzog . Here he loitered over a ten-cent bargain Dryden and Pope . Through a chink he saw the fiery morning of high summer , the wicked spiny green of vines , and the tight , shapely heads of wild roses , the huge elm in front , dying on him , the oriole 's nest , gray and heart-shaped . He read , " 1 am His Highness ' dog at Kew . " But Herzog had a touch of arthritis in the neck . The stony cell became too damp . He removed the top of the tank with a grating noise and pulled the rubber fitting to release the water . The parts were rusty , stiff . . . . His Highness ' dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog are you ? Mornings he tried to reserve for brainwork . He corresponded with the Widener Library to try to get the Abhandlungen der Koniglich Sdchsischen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaft . His desk was covered with unpaid bills , unanswered letters . To raise money , he took on hackwork . University presses sent manuscripts for his professional judgment . They lay in bundles , unopened . The sun grew hot , the soil was damp and black , and Herzog looked with despair on the thriving luxuriant life of the plants . He had all this paper to get through , and no help . The house was waiting  --  huge , hollow , urgent . Quos VULT PERDERE DEMENTAT , he lettered in dust . The gods were working on him , but they had n't demented him enough yet . In commenting on monographs , Moses ' very hand rebelled . Five minutes at a letter and he got writer 's cramp . His look turned wooden . He was running out of excuses . I regret the delay . A bad case of poison ivy has kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moses stared at half-painted walls , discolored ceilings , filthy windows . Something had come over him . He used to be able to keep going , but now he worked at about two per cent of efficiency , handled every piece of paper five or ten times and misplacedeverything . It was too much ! He was going under . He picked up the oboe . In his dark study , vines clutching the bulging screen , Herzog played Handel and Purcell  --  jigs , bourrees , contredanses , his face puffed out , fingers fleet on the keys , the music hopping and tumbling , absent-minded and sad . Below , the washing machine ran , two steps clockwise , one step counter . The kitchen was foul enough to breed rats . Egg yolks dried on the plates , coffee turned green in the cups  --  toast , cereal , maggots breeding in marrow bones , fruit flies , house flies , dollar bills , postage stamps and trading stamps soaking on the formica counter . Madeleine , to get away from his music , slammed the screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Studebaker had a split in the muffler . She started down the slope . Unless you remembered to bear right the tailpipe would scrape on the rocks . Herzog played softer as he waited for the sound . That muffler would come off one of these days , but he had stopped mentioningT 7 T  --  it to her . He had too many subjects of this sort . They made her angry . Through a cover of honeysuckle that bent the screen inwardhe watched for her to reappear on the second curve of the slope . Pregnancy had thickened her features but she was still beautiful . Such beauty makes men breeders , studs and servants . As she drove , her nose worked involuntarily under the sight-obscuring fringe of her hair ( all part of the process of steering ) . Her fingers , some elegant , some nail-bitten , gripped the agate steering wheel . He declared it was unsafe for a pregnant woman to drive . He thought she must at least get a driver 's license . She said if a state trooper stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone , he dried the oboe , looked over the reeds , shut the frowzy plush case . He wore fieldglasses about his neck . Once in a while he tried to examine a bird . Usually it was gone before he could get it in focus . Abandoned , he sat at his desk , a flush door on wrought-iron legs . Philodendrons grew from the base of his lamp , twining about the iron . With a rubber band he shot wads of paper at the horseflies on the paint-streaked windows . He was not a skillful painter . He tried a spray gun at first , attaching it to the rear of the vacuum cleaner , a very efficient blower . Muffled in rags to protect the lungs , Moses sprayed ceilings , but the gun speckled the windows and banisters and he went back to the brush . Dragging the ladder and buckets and rags and thinners , scraping with his putty knife , he patched and painted , reaching left , right , above , this stretch , beyond , way out , to the corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve a straight line , laying paint on in big strokes or in an agony of finesse . Spatteredand streaming sweat when the frenzy wore off , he went into the garden . Stripped naked , he fell in the hammock . Meanwhile , Madeleine toured the antique shops with Phoebe Gersbach , or brought home loads of groceries from the Pittsfield supermarkets . Moses was continually after her about money . Beginninghis reproaches , he tried to keep his voice low . It was alwayssomething trivial that set him off  --  a bounced check , a chicken that had rotted in the icebox , a new shirt torn up for rags . Gradually his feelings became very fierce . " When are you going to stop bringing home this junk , Madeleine  --  these busted commodes , these spinning wheels . " : I 2 2 : " We have to furnish the place . I ca n't stand these empty rooms . " " Where 's all the dough going ? I 'm working myself sick . " He felt black with rage inside . " I pay the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " You said you had to learn to handle money . No one ever trusted you . Well , you 're being trusted now and the checks are bouncing . The dress shop just phoned  --  Milly Crozier . Five hundredbucks on a maternity outfit . Who 's going to be born  --  Louis Quatorze ? " " Yes , I know , your darling mother wore flour sacks . " " You do n't need a Park Avenue obstetrician . Phoebe Genbathused the Pittsfield hospital . How can I get you to New York from here ? It 's three and a half hours . " " We 'll go ten days before . " " What about all this work ? " " You can carry your Hegel to the city . You have n't cracked a book in months anyway . The whole thing is a neurotic mess . These bushels of notes . It 's grotesque how disorganized you are . You 're no better than any other kind of addict  --  sick with abstractions . Curse Hegel , anyway , and this crappy old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to do all the work . " Herzog made himself dull by repeating what was right . He was maddening , too . He realized it . He appeared to know how everything ought to go , down to the smallest detail ( under the category of " Free Concrete Mind , " misapprehension of a universal by the developing consciousness  --  reality opposing the " law of the heart , " alien necessity gruesomely crushing individuality , undsoweiter ) . Oh , Herzog granted that he was in the wrong . But all he asked , it seemed to him , was a bit of cooperation in his effort , benefiting everyone , to work toward a meaningful life . Hegel was curiously significant but also utterly cockeyed . Of course . That was the whole point . Simpler and without such elaborate metaphysicalrigmarole was Spinoza 's Prop . XXXVII ; man 's desire to have others rejoice in the good in which he rejoices , not to make others live according to his way of thinking  --  ex ipsius ingenio . Herzog , mulling over these ideas as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Versailles as well as Jerusalem in the green:I23hot Berkshire summers . Time and again he was brought down from the ladder to the telephone . Madeleine 's checks were bouncing . " Jesus Christ ! " he cried out . " Not again , Mady ! " She was ready for him in a bottle-green maternity blouse and knee-length stockings . She was becoming very stout . The doctor had warned her not to eat candy . On the sly , she greedily devoured enormous Hershey bars , the thirty-cent size . " Ca n't you add ! There 's not a damn reason in the world for these checks to come back . " Moses glared at her . " Oh  --  here we go with this same petty stuff . " " It 's not petty . It 's damn serious . . . . " " I suppose you 'll start on my upbringing now  --  my lousy , freeloadingbohemian family , all chiselers . And you gave me your good name . I know this routine backwards . " " Do I repeat myself ? Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Spending your dead father 's money . Dear Daddy ! That 's what you choke on . Well , he was your father . I do n't ask you to share my horrible father . So do n't try to force your old man down my throat . " " We 've got to have a little order in these surroundings . " Madeleine said quickly , firmly , and accurately , " You 'll never get the surroundings you want . Those are in the twelfth century somewhere . Always crying for the old home and the kitchen table with the oilcloth on it and your Latin book . Okay  --  let 's hear your sad old story . Tell me about your poor mother . And your father . And your boarder , the drunkard . And the old synagogue , and the bootlegging , and your Aunt Zipporah . . . Oh , what balls ! " " As if you did n't have a past of your own . " " Oh , balls ! So now we 're going to hear how you SAVED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightened puppy I was . How I was n't strong enough to face life . But you gave me LOVE , from your big heart , and rescued me from the priests . Yes , cured me of menstrual cramps by servicing me so good . You SAVED me . You SACRIFICED your freedom . I took you away from Daisy and your son , and your Japanese screw . Your important time and money and attention . " Her wild blue glare was so intense that her eyes seemed twisted . " Madeleine ! " " Oh  --  shit ! " : I24 : " Just think a minute . " " Think ? What do you know about thinking ? " " Maybe I married you to improve my mind ! " said Herzog . " I 'm learning . " " Well , I 'll teach you , do n't worry ! " said the beautiful , pregnant Madeleine between her teeth . Herzog noted , from a favorite source  --  Opposition is true friendship . His house , his child , yea , all that a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beautiful soul  --  the exceptional wife , the angelicchild and the perfect friends all dwelt in the Berkshires together . The learned professor sat at his studies . . . . Oh , he had really been asking for it . Because he insisted on being the ingenu whose earnestness made his own heart flutter  --  zisse n'shamele , a sweet little soul , Tennie had called Moses . At forty ; to earn such a banal reputation ! His forehead grew wet . Such stupidity deserved harsher punishment  --  a sickness , a jail sentence . Again , he was only being " lucky " ( Ramona , food and wine , invitations to the seashore ) . Still , extreme self-abuse was not really interesting to him , either . It was not the most relevant thing . Not to be a fool might not be worth the difficult alternatives . Anyway , who was that non-fool ? Was it the power-lover , who bent the public to his will  --  the scientific intellectual who administered a budget of billions ? Clear eyes , a hard head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't it be nice to be one ? But Herzog worked under different orders  --  doing , he trusted , the work of the future . The revolutions of the twentieth century , the liberationof the masses by production , created private life but gave nothing to fill it with . This was where such as he came in . The progress of civilization  --  indeed , the survival of civilization  --  depended on the successes of Moses E. Herzog . And in treating him as she did , Madeleine injured a great project . This was , in the eyes of Moses E. Herzog , what was so grotesque and deplorable about the experience of Moses E. Herzog . A very special sort of lunatic expects to inculcate his principles . Sandor Himmelstein , Valentine Gersbach , Madeleine P. Herzog , Moses himself . Reality instructors . They want to teach you  --  to punish you with  --  the lessons of the Real . : I25Moses , a collector of pictures , had kept a photograph of Madeleine , aged twelve , in riding habit . She was posed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl with fat wrists and desperatedark shadows under her eyes , premature signs of suffering and of a craving for revenge . In jodhpurs , boots , and bowler she had the hauteur of the female child who knows it wo n't be long beforeshe is nubile and has the power to hurt . This is mental politics . The strength to do evil is sovereignty . She knew more at twelve than I did at forty . Now Daisy had been a very different sort of person -- cooler , more regular , a conventional Jewish woman . Herzog had photographs of her , too , in his foot locker under the bed , but there was no need to examine pictures , he could evoke her face at will  --  slant green eyes , large ones , kinky , golden but lusterless hair , a clear skin . Her manner was shy but also rather stubborn . Without difficulty , Herzog saw her as she had appeared on a summer morning beneath the El on 51st Street , Chicago , a college student with grimy texts  --  Park and Burgess , Ogburn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seersucker , square at the neck . Beneath its laundered purity , she had small white shoes , bare legs , and her hair was held at the top by a barrette . The red streetcarcame from the slums to the west . It clanged , swayed , wallowed , its trolley shedding thick green sparks , tatters of paper flying in its wake . Moses had stood behind her on the carbolic-reeking platformwhen she gave her transfer slip to the conductor . From her bare neck and shoulders he inhaled the fragrance of summer apples . Daisy was a country girl , a Buckeye who grew up near Zanesville . She was childishly systematic about things . It sometimes amused Moses to recall that she had a file card , clumsily printed out , to cover every situation . Her awkward form of organization had had a certain charm . When they were married she put his pocket money in an envelope , in a green metal file bought for budgeting . Daily reminders , bills , concert tickets were pinned by thumbtacks to the bulletin board . Calendars were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , containment were Daisy 's strength . Dear Daisy , I have a few things to say to you . By my irregularityand turbulence of spirit I brought out the very worst in Daisy . I caused the seams of her stockings to be so straight , and the buttons.I26. to be buttoned symmetrically . I was behind those rigid curtains and underneath the square carpets . Roast breast of veal every Sundaywith bread stuffing like clay was due to my disorders , my huge involvement  --  huge but evidently formless  --  in the history of thought . She took Moses ' word for it that he was seriously occupied . Of course a wife 's duty was to stand by this puzzling and often disagreeable Herzog . She did so with heavy neutrality , recordingher objections each time  --  once but not more . The rest was silence  --  such heavy silence as he felt in Connecticut when he was finishing Romanticism and Christianity . The chapter on " Romantics and Enthusiasts " nearly did him in  --  it almost ended them both . ( The Enthusiastic reaction against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of certain temperaments . ) Here Daisy picked up and left him alone in Connecticut . She had to go back to Ohio . Her father was dying . Moses read the literature of Enthusiasm in his cottage , by the small nickel-trimmed kitchen stove . Wrapped in a blanket like an Indian , he listened to the radio  --  debated the pros and cons of Enthusiasm with himself . It was a winter of rocklike ice . The pond like a slab of halite  --  green , white , resonant ice , bitterly ringing underfoot . The trickling mill dam froze in twisting pillars . The elms , giant harp shapes , made cracking noises . Herzog , responsible to civilization in his icy outpost , lying in bed in an aviator 's helmet when the stoves were out , fitted together Bacon and Locke from one side and Methodism and William Blake from the other . His nearest neighbor was a clergyman , Mr. Idwal . Idwal 's automobile , a Model A Ford , was running when Herzog 's Whippet had frozen solid . They drove to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chocolate gelatin , and left them , neighborly , on Moses ' table . He returned from his solitary walks on the pond , in the woods , and found pies in big Pyrex plates on which he warmed his numb cheeks and fingertips . In the morning , eating gelatin pie for breakfast , he saw Idwal , ruddy and small , with steel spectacles , in his bedroom swinging Indian clubs , doing knee-bends in his long underwear . His wife sat in her parlor , hands folded , the spidery design of lace curtains thrown on her face by sunlight . Moses was invited to play his oboe , accompanying Mrs. Idwal , who played a melodeon , on Sunday evenings while the farm families . I 2 7 . sang hymns . And were they farmers ? No , they were the country poor  --  odd-job people . The little parlor was hot , the air bad , the hymns pierced with Jewish melancholy by Moses and his reeds . His relations with the Reverend and Mrs. Idwal were excellentuntil the minister started to give him testimonials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The photos of these rabbis in fur hats , bearded , were put down with the pies . The large eyes of those men and especially their lips thrust out from foaming beards began to seem crazy to Moses , and he thought it time to get away from the snowbound cottage . He was afraid for his own sanity , living like this , especially after the death of Daisy 's father . Moses thought he saw him , met him in the woods , and when he opened doors he encountered his father-in-law , vivid and characteristic , waiting by a table or sitting in the bathroom . Herzog made a mistake in rejecting Idwal 's rabbis . The clergymanwas keener than ever to convert him and dropped in every afternoon for theological discussions until Daisy returned . Sad , clear-eyed , mostly mute , resistant . But a wife . And the child ! The thaws began  --  ideal for making snowmen . Moses and Marco lined the drive with them . Little anthracite eyes glittered even by starlight . In spring the blackness of night was filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the country . The blood-colored sunsets of winter and solitude were behind him . They did n't seem so bad now that he had survived them . Survival ! he noted . Till we figure out what 's what . Till the chance comes to exert a positive influence . ( Personal responsibility for history , a trait of Western culture , rooted in the Testaments , Old and New , the idea of the continual improvement of human life on this earth . What else explained Herzog 's ridiculous intensity ? ) Lord , I ran to fight in Thy holy cause , but kept tripping , never reached the scene of the struggle . He saw through this as well . If nothing else , he was too rich in diseases to be satisfied with such a description . From the middle height of New York , looking down , seeing lunchtime crowds like ants upon smoked glass , Herzog , wrapped in his wrinkled robe and sipping cold coffee , set apart from daily labor for greater achievements , but at present without confidence in his calling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dear Dr. Mossbach , I. I 2 8 . am sorry you are not satisfied with my treatment of T. E. Hulme and his definition of Romanticism as " spilt religion . " There is something to be said for his view . He wanted things to be clear , dry , spare , pure , cool , and hard . With this I think we can all sympathize . I too am repelled by the " dampness , " as he called it , and the swarming of Romantic feelings . I see what a villain Rousseauwas , and how degenerate ( I do not complain that he was ungentlemanly ; it ill becomes me ) . But I do not see what we can answer when he says " Je sens mon cceur et je connais les hormnes . " Bottled religion , on conservative principles  --  does that intend to deprive the heart of such powers  --  do you think ? Hulme 's followers made sterility their truth , confessing their impotence . This was their passion . Still fighting it out , Herzig was fairly deadly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His docile ways , his modest conduct  --  he did n't deceive himself . The certainty of being right , a flow of power , rose in his bowels and burned in his legs . Queer , the luxurious victories of anger ! There was passionate satire in Herzog . Still he knew that the demolition of error was not it . He began to have a new horror of winning , of the victories of untrammeledautonomy . Man has a nature , but what is it ? Those who have confidently described it , Hobbes , Freud , et cetera , by telling us what we are " intrinsically , " are not our greatest benefactors . This is true also for Rousseau . I sympathize with Hulme 's attack on the introduction by the Romantics of Perfection into human things , but do not like his narrow repressiveness , either . Modern science , least bothered with the definition of human nature , knowing only the activity of investigation , achieves its profoundest results through anonymity , recognizing only the brilliant functioning of intellect . Such truth as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moratorium on definitions of human nature is now best . Herzog abandoned this theme with characteristic abruptness . Dear Nachman , he wrote . I know it was you I saw on 8th St. last Monday . Running away from me . Herzog 's face darkened . It was you . My friend nearly forty years ago  --  playmates on NapoleonStreet . The Montreal slums . In a beatnik cap , on the ra7zledazzlestreet of lion-bearded homosexuals wearing green eye paint , there , suddenly , was Herzog 's childhood playmate . A heavy nose , hair white , thick unclean glasses . The stooped poet took oneI29 : look at Moses and ran away . On gaunt legs , under urgent pressure , he fled to the other side of the street . He turned up his collar and stared into the window of the cheese shop . Nachman ! Did you think I 'd ask for the money you owe me ? I wrote that off , long ago . It meant very little to me , in Paris after the War . I had it then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was living in the Arab slum on Rue St. Jacques . Herzog was installed in comfort on the Rue Marbeuf . Wrinkled and dirty , Nachman , his nose red from weeping , his creased face the face of a dying man , appeared at Herzog 's door one morning . " What 's happened ! " " Moses , they 've taken my wife away  --  my little Laura . " " Wait a minute  --  what 's up ? " Herzog was perhaps a little cold , then , repelled by such excesses . " Her father . The old man from the floor-covering business . Spirited her away . The old Sorcerer . She 'll die without me . The child ca n't bear life without me . And I ca n't live without her . I 've got to get back to New York . " " Come in . Come in . We ca n't talk in this lousy hallway . " Nachman entered the little drawing room . It was a furnished apartment in the style of the twenties  --  spitefully correct . Nachmanseemed hesitant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been to all the lines already . There 's space on the Hollandia tomorrow . Lend me dough or I 'm ruined . You 're my only friend in Paris . " Honestly , I thought you 'd be better off in America . Nachman and Laura had been wandering up and down Europe , sleeping in ditches in the Rimbaud country , reading Van Gogh 's letters aloud to each other  --  Rilke 's poems . Laura was not too strong in the head , either . She was thin , soft-faced , the corners of her pale mouth turned down . She caught the flu in Belgium . " I 'll pay you every penny . " Nachman wrung his hands . His fingers had grown knobby  --  rheumatic . His face was coarse  --  slack from illness , suffering , and absurdity . I felt it would be cheaper in the long run to send you back to New York . In Paris I was stuck with you . You see , I do n't pretend that I was altruistic . Perhaps , thought Herzog , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed even more than he has ? Was Nachman horrified to see Moses ? But we did play in the street together . I learned the aleph-beth from your father , Reb Shika . Nachman 's family lived in the yellow tenement just opposite . Five years old , Moses crossed Napoleon Street . Up the wooden staircase with slanted , warped treads . Cats shrank into corners or bolted softly upstairs . Their dry turds crumbled in the darkness with a spicy odor . Reb Shika had a yellow color , Mongolian , a tiny handsome man . He wore a black satin skullcap , a mustache like Lenin 's . His narrow chest was clad in a winter undershirt  --  Penman 's woollens . The Bible lay open on the coarse table cover . Moses clearly saw the Hebrew characters-DMAI ocmcxo -- the blood of thy brother . Yes , that was it . God speaking to Cain . Thy brother 's blood cries out to me from the earth . At eight , Moses and Nachman shared a bench in the cellar of the synagogue . The pages of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damp . The rabbi , short-bearded , his soft big nose violently pitted with black , scolding them . " You , Rozavitch , you slacker . What does it say here about Potiphar 's wife , V'tispesayu b'vigdi . . . " " And she took hold of ... " " Of what ? Beged . " " Beged . A coat . " " A garment , you little thief . Mamzer ! I 'm sorry for your father . Some heir he 's got ! Some Kaddish ! Ham and pork you 'll be eating , before his body is in the grave . And you , Herzog , with those behemotheyes  --  V'yaizov bigdo b'yodo . " " And he left it in her hands . " " Left what ? " " Bigdo , the garment . " " You watch your step , Herzog , Moses . Your mother thinks you 'll be a great lamden  --  a rabbi . But I know you , how lazy you are . Mothers ' hearts are broken by mamzeirim like you ! Eh ! Do I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only refuge was the W.C. , where the disinfectant camphor balls dwindled in the green trough of the urinal , and old men came down from the shul with webby eyes nearly blind , sighing , grumblingsnatches of liturgy as they waited for the water to come . Urine-rusted brass , scaly green . In an open stall , pants dropped to his feet , sat Nachman playing the harmonica . " It 's a Long , Long Way to Tipperary . " " Love Sends a Little Gift of Roses . " The peak of his cap was warped . You heard the saliva in the cells of the tin instrument as he sucked and blew . The bowler-hatted elders washed their hands , gave their beards a finger-combing . Moses observed them . Almost certainly , Nachman ran away from the power of his old friend 's memory . Herzog persecuted everyone with it . It was like a terrible engine . Last time we met  --  how many years ago was that ?  --  I went with you to visit Laura . Laura was then in an insane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corners . It was a thousand bus stops out on Long Island . In the hospital the women in green cotton dresses wandered in the corridors on soft shoes , murmuring . Laura had bandaged wrists . It was her third suicide attempt that Moses knew of . She sat in a corner , holding her breasts in her arms , wanting to talk of French literature only . Her face was moony , lips however moving quickly . Moses had to agree with what he understood nothing of  --  the shape of Valery 's images . Then he and Nachman left , toward sunset . They crossed the cement yard after an autumn rainfall . From the building , a crowd of ghosts in green uniforms watched the visitors depart . Laura , at the grill , raised her taped wrist , a wan hand . Good-by . Her long thin mouth silently said , Good-by , good-by . The straight hair fell beside her cheeks  --  a stiff childish figure with female swellings . Nachman was hoarsely saying , " My innocent darling . My bride . They 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  our masters . Imprisoned her . As if to love me proved she was mad . But I shall be strong enough to protect our love , " said gaunt , furrowed Nachman . His cheeks were sunken . Under the eyes his skin was yellow . " Why does she keep trying to kill herself ? " said Moses . " The persecution of her family . What do you think ? The bourgeoisworld of Westchester ! Wedding announcements , linens , charge accounts , that was what her mother and father expected of her . But this is a pure soul that understands only pure things . She is a stranger here . The family only wants to part us . In New York.132. we were wanderers too . When I came back  --  thanks to you , and I 'll repay you , I 'll work !  --  we did n't have money to rent a room . How could I take a job ? Who would look after her ? So friends gave us shelter . Food . A cot to lie down . To make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely said , " Oh ? " " I would n't tell anyone but you , old friend . We had to take care . In our ecstasies we had to warn each other to be more moderate . It was like a holy act  --  we must n't make the gods jealous . ... " Nachman spoke in a throbbing , droning voice . " Good-by , my blessed spirit  --  my dear one . Good-by . " He blew kisses at the window with painful sweetness . On the way to the bus , he went on lecturing in his unreal way , fervent and dull . " So back of it all is bourgeois America . This is a crude world of finery and excrement . A proud , lazy civilization that worships its own boorishness . You and I were brought up in the old poverty . I do n't know how American you 've become since the old days in Canada  --  you 've lived here a long time . But I will never worship the fat gods . Not I. I 'm no Marxist , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rilke . But a man like Laura 's father ! You understand ! Las Vegas , Miami Beach . They wanted Laura to catch a husband at the Fountainblue , a husband with money . At the edge of doom , beside the last grave of mankind , they will still be counting their paper . Praying over their balance sheets . . . . " Nachman went on with boring persistent power . He had lost teeth , and his jaw was smaller , his gray cheeks were bristly . Herzog could still see him as he had been at six . In fact he could not dismiss his vision of the two Nachmans , side by side . And it was the child with his fresh face , the smiling gap in his front teeth , the buttoned blouse and the short pants that was real , not this gaunt apparition of crazy lecturing Nachman . " Perhaps , " he was saying , " people wish life to end . They have polluted it . Courage , honor , frankness , friendship , duty , all made filthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that prolongs useless existence . There was a time when men were born , lived , and died . But do you call these men ? We are only creatures . Death himself must be tired of us . I can see Death coming before God to say What shall I do ? There is no more grandeur in being Death . Releaseme , God , from this meanness . ' "  --  133 " It is n't as bad as you make out , Nachman , " Moses remembered answering . " Most people are unpoetical , and you consider this a betrayal . " " Well , childhood friend , you have learned to accept a mixed condition of life . But I have had visions of judgment . I see mainly the obstinacy of cripples . We do not love ourselves , but persist in stubbornness . Each man is stubbornly , stubbornly him- self . Above all himself , to the end of time . Each of these creatures has some secret quality , and for this quality he is prepared to do anything . He will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliver his quality to anyone else . Sooner let the world turn to drifting powder . This is what my poems are about . You do n't think highly of my New Psalms . You 're blind , old friend . " " Maybe . " " But a good man , Moses . Rooted in yourself . But a good heart . Like your mother . A gentle spirit . You got it from her . I was hun- gry and she fed me . She washed my hands and sat me at the table . That I remember . She was the only one who was kind to my Uncle Ravitch , the drunkard . I sometimes say a prayer for her . " Yiskor elohim es nishmas Imi . . . the soul of my mother . " She 's been dead a long time . " " And I pray for you , Moses . " The bus on giant tires advanced through sunset-colored pud- dles over leaves , ailanthus twigs . Its route was interminable , through the low , brick , suburban , populous vastness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nachman ran away . He looked old , derelict , stooped , crooked as he sprinted to the cheese shop . Where is his wife ? He must have beat it to avoid explana- tions . His mad sense of decency told him to shun such an en- counter . Or has he forgotten everything ? Or would he be glad to forget it ? But I , with my memory  --  all the dead and the mad are in my custody , and I am the nemesis of the would-be forgotten . I bind others to my feelings , and oppress them . Was Ravitch actually your uncle , or only a landtsman ? I was never certain . Ravitch boarded with the Herzogs on Napoleon Street . Like a tragic actor of the Yiddish stage , with a straight drunken nose and a bowler pressing on the veins of his forehead , Ravitch , in an apron , worked at the fruit store near Rachel Street in 1922. : 134 : There at the market in zero weather he was sweeping a mixed powder of sawdust and snow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and against it pressed the piled blood-oranges and russet apples . And that was melancholy Ravitch , red with drink and cold . The project of his life was to send for his family , a wife and two children who were still in Russia . He 'd have to find them first , for they were lost during the Revolution . Now and then he soberly cleaned himself up and went to the Hebrew Immigrants ' Aid Society to make an inquiry . But nothing ever happened . He drank his pay  --  a shicker . No one judged himself more harshly . When he came out of the saloon he stood wavering in the street , directing traffic , falling among horses and trucks in the slush . The police were tired of throwing him in the drunk tank . They brought him home , to Herzog 's hallway , and pushed him in . Ravitch , late at night , sang on the freezing stairs in a sobbing voice . " Alein , alein , alein , alein Elend vie a shteinMit die tzen finger  --  alein " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light in the kitchen , listening . He wore a Russian sleeping suit of linen with a pleated front , the last of his gentleman 's wardrobe from Petersburg . The stove was out , and Moses , in the same bed with Willie and Shura , sat up , the three of them , under the lumpy wads of the quilt , looking at their father . He stood under the bulb , which had a spike at the end like a German helmet . The large loose twist of tungsten filament blazed . Annoyed and pitying , Father Herzog , with his round head and brown mustache , looked upward . The straight groove between his eyes came and went . He nodded and mused . " Alone , alone , alone , alone Solitary as a stoneWith my ten fingers  --  alone " Mother Herzog spoke from her room , " Yonah  --  help him in . " " All right , " said Father Herzog , but he waited . " Yonah . . . It 's a pity . " " Pity on us , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You sleep ,  --  135you 're free from misery awhile , and he wakes you up . A Jewish drunkard ! He ca n't even do that right . Why ca n't he be freilich and cheerful when he drinks , eh ? No , he has to cry and tear your heartstrings . Well , curse him . " Half laughing , Father Herzog cursed the heartstrings , too . " It 's enough that I have to rent a room to a miserable shicker . " , Al tastir poncho mimeniI 'm broke without a penny . Do not hide Thy countenance from us Vich nobody can deny . " Ravitch , tuneless and persistent , cried in the black , frozen stair- case . " O'Brien Lo mir trinken a glesele vi-ine Al tastir poncho mimeni I 'm broke without a penny Vich nobody can deny . " Father Herzog , silent and wry , laughed under his breath . " Yonah  --  I beg you . Genug schon . " " Oh , give him time . Why should I schlepp out my guts . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be covered with vomit , his pants filled . " But he went . He pitied Ravitch , too , though Ravitch was one of the symbols of his changed condition . In Petersburg there were servants . In Russia , Father Herzog . The children still gazed into the empty kitchen . The black cookstove against the wall , extinct ; the double gas ring connected by rubber pipe to the meter . A Japanese reed mat protected the wall from cooking stains . It amused the boys to hear how their father coaxed drunken Ravitch to get on his feet . It was family theater . " Nu , landtsman ? Can you walk ? It 's freezing . Now , get your crooked feet on the step  --  schneller , schneller . " He laughed with his bare breath . " Well , I think we 'll leave your dreckische pants out here . Phew ! " The boys pressed together in the cold , smiling . .136 : Papa supported him through the kitchen  --  Ravitch in his filthy drawers , the red face , dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed eyes . As for my late unlucky father , J. Herzog , he was not a big man , one of the small-boned Herzogs , finely made , round-headed , keen , nervous , handsome . In his frequent bursts of temper he slapped his sons swiftly with both hands . He did everything quickly , neatly , with skillful Eastern European flourishes : combing his hair , buttoning his shirt , stropping his bone-handled razors , sharpening pencils on the ball of his thumb , holding a loaf of bread to his breast and slicing toward himself , tying parcels with tight little knots , jotting like an artist in his account book . There each canceled page was covered with a carefully drawn X. The 1s and 7s carried bars and streamers . They were like pennants in the wind of failure . First Father Herzog failed in Petersburg , where he went through two dowries in one year . He had been importing onions from Egypt . Under Pobedonostsev the police caught up with him for illegal residence . He was convicted and sentenced . The account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick green paper . Father Herzog sometimes unfolded it and read aloud to the entire family , translating the proceedings against Ilyona Isakovitch Gerzog . He never served his sentence . He got away . Because he was nervy , hasty , obstinate , rebellious . He came to Canada , where his sister Zipporah Yaffe was living . In 1913 he bought a piece of land near Valleyfield , Quebec , and failed as a farmer . Then he came into town and failed as a baker ; failed in the dry-goods business ; failed as a jobber ; failed as a sack manufacturer in the War , when no one else failed . He failed as a junk dealer . Then he became a marriage broker and failedtooshort-tempered and blunt . And now he was failing as a bootlegger , on the run from the provincial Liquor Commission . Makinga bit of a living . In haste and defiantly , with a clear tense face , walking with mingled desperation and high style , a little awkwardly dropping his weight on one heel as he went , his coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the red hide cracking . This coat sweeping open as he walked , or marched his one-man Jewish march , he was saturated with the odor of the Caporals he smoked as he coveredMontreal in his swing  --  Papineau , Mile-End , Verdun , Lachine , Point St. Charles . He looked for business opportunities  --  bankruptcies , job lots , mergers , fire sales , produce  --  to rescue him from illegality . He could calculate percentages mentally at high speed , but he lacked the cheating imagination of a successful businessman . And so he kept a little still in Mile-End , where goats fed in the empty lots . He traveled on the tramcar . He sold a bottle here and there and waited for his main chance . American rum-runners would buy the stuff from you at the border , any amount , spot cash , if you could get it there . Meanwhile he smoked cigarettes on the cold platforms of streetcars . The Revenue was trying to catch him . Spotters were after him . On the roads to the border were hijackers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willie and Moses were sickly . Helen studied the piano . Shura was fat , greedy , disobedient , a plotting boy . The rent , back rent , notes due , doctors ' bills to pay , and he had no English , no friends , no influence , no trade , no assets but his still  --  no help in all the world . His sister Zipporah in St. Anne was rich , very rich , which only made matters worse . Grandfather Herzog was still alive , then . With the instinct of a Herzog for the grand thing , he took refuge in the Winter Palace in 1918 ( the Bolsheviks allowed it for a while ) . The old man wrote long letters in Hebrew . He had lost his precious books in the upheaval . Study was impossible now . In the Winter Palace you had to walk up and down all day to find a minyan . Of course there was hunger , too . Later , he predicted that the Revolution would fail and tried to acquire Czarist currency , to become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of worthless rubles , and Willie and Moses played with great sums . You held the glorious bills to the light and you saw Peter the Great and Catherine in the watermarked rainbow paper . Grandfather Herzog was in his eighties but still strong . His mind was powerful and his Hebrew calligraphy elegant . The letters were read aloud in Montrealby Father Herzog  --  accounts of cold , lice , famine , epidemics , the dead . The old man wrote , " Shall I ever see the faces of my children ? And who will bury me ? " Father Herzog approached the next phrase two or three times , but could not find his full voice . Only a whisper came out . The tears were , in his eyes and he suddenlyput his hand over his mustached mouth and hurried from the room . Mother Herzog , large-eyed , sat with the children in:138 : the primitive kitchen which the sun never entered . It was like a cave with the ancient black stove , the iron sink , the green cupboards , the gas ring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a partly averted face . She encountered it on the left but sometimes seemed to avoid it on the right . On this withdrawn side she often had a dreaming look , melancholy , and seemed to be seeing the Old World  --  her father the famous misnagid , her tragic mother , her brothers living and dead , her sister , and her linens and servants in Petersburg , the dacha in Finland ( all founded on Egyptian onions ) . Now she was cook , washerwoman , seamstress on Napoleon Street in the slum . Her hair turned gray , and she lost her teeth , her very fingernails wrinkled . Her hands smelled of the sink . Herzog was thinking , however , how she found the strength to spoil her children . She certainly spoiled me . Once , at nightfall , she was pulling me on the sled , over crusty ice , the tiny glitter of snow , perhaps four o'clock of a short day in January . Near the grocery we met an old baba in a shawl who said , " Why are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the eyes . Her slender cold face . She was breathing hard . She wore the torn seal coat and a red pointed wool cap and thin button boots . Clusters of dry fish hung in the shop , a rancid sugar smell , cheese , soap  --  a terrible dust of nutrition came from the open door . The bell on a coil of wire was bobbing , ringing . " Daughter , do n't sacrifice your strength to children , " said the shawled crone in the freezing dusk of the street . I would n't get off the sled . I pretended not to understand . One of life 's hardest jobs , to make a quick understanding slow . I think I succeeded , thought Herzog . Mama 's brother Mikhail died of typhus in Moscow . I took the letter from the postman and brought it upstairs  --  the long latchstringran through loops under the banister . It was washday . The copper boiler steamed the window . She was rinsing and wringing in a tub . When she read the news she gave a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm lay in the water , sleeve and all . We two were alone in the house . I was terrified when she lay like that , legs spread , her long hair undone , lids brown , mouth bloodless , deathlike . But then she got up and went to lie down . She wept all day . But in the morning she cooked the oatmeal nevertheless . We were up early. : 139 :
