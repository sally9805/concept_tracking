" The Bible says Thou shall grope at noonday , as the blind gropeth in darkness . ' One feels occasionally that for us it is that kind of noonday . " Thus , in a speech at the University of North Carolina last week , John Gardner , Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare , articulated the Administration 's concern at the rancorous tone that is now so pervasive in America . " More and more , " said Gardner , " hostility and venom are the hallmarks of any conversation on the affairs of the nation . <P> Today , all seem caught up in mutual recriminations-Negro and white , rich and poor , conservative and liberal , hawk and dove , labor and management , North and South , young and old . " <P> The times , said Gardner , call for cohesion . " Today , the first duty of responsible citizens is to bind together rather than tear apart . The fissures in our society are already dangerously deep . " It was a ringing cry for unity from a wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bluff &; Tough . Gardner was referring to every facet of American life , from the turbulent cities through the quarrelsome Congress to the Viet Nam war , which sparks most of the venom and hostility in the American air . Gardner is not the only one who is bothered . New York 's Senator Jacob Javits called on President Johnson to deliver an " extraordinary State of the Union message " to resolve American doubts and dissent over the war . But the President seems to prefer a different tactic . He is deploying his most influential aides in a verbal counterattack . <P> Dean Rusk , for example , made no effort to restrain his anger in an unprecedented 55-minute news conference that lashed out at the President 's crit ics . " If any who would be our adversary , " warned the Secretary of State , " should suppose that our treaties are a bluff , or will be abandoned if the going gets tough , the result could be catastrophe for all mankind . " Bluntly disagreeing with doubters , Rusk said that abandoning Saigon would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Acid &; Acrimony . Every bit as aggressive as Rusk , Vice President Hubert Humphrey ranged from Minnesota to California and back to Washington , where he decried the " notes of acrimony , the acid quality heard today on our objectives . " He said that " the war would be shortened considerably if Americans showed their sense of purpose . " House Speaker John McCormack warned as well that further divisiveness over Viet Nam would only prolong the war . If he were guilty of giving such comfort , McCormack added , " my conscience would disturb me the rest of my life . " <P> Senate Majority Leader Mike Mans field , a sometime critic of the war , also rallied behind the President . He urged his colleagues to forget the simplistic labels of " hawk " and " dove , " and tried to draw some of the fire away from L.B.J. by denouncing the United Nations , which Mansfield charged , was " dodging its responsibility " to bring " this disastrous , this dirty , this brutal war to an end .
