Most adults dislike caterpillars for vague , undefinable reasons , while most children like to stroke their cute , fuzzy backs . The adults are right . At least 50 species , among the hundreds of caterpillars in the U.S. , are a hazard to health simply because some of the long and often colorful hair on their backs is irritating or even poisonous to the touch . <P> The worst offender , say Dr. Campbell W. McMillan and Dr. William R. Purcell in the New England Journal of Medicine , is the caterpillar that grows into one of the flannel moths , Megalopyge opercularis . Country folk use so many other names that they have confused the issue . In North Carolina it is usually the " woolly slug , " in Texas it is often " woolly worm , " and in between it may be the puss caterpillar , possum bug , or Italian asp . In Mexico it becomes el perrito , or little dog . By any name , it stings . <P> Houston doctors report that there seem to be epidemics of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moths , and therefore their caterpillars , are especially numerous . In one recent year , Houston area doctors reported 2,130 cases ; almost every one involved severe local pain and local swelling . One patient out of three had swelling of the lymph glands and a headache too severe to be relieved by aspirin . One in 20 went into shock , and eight patients had to be hospitalized , mainly for convulsions . Children are not the only victims : a Houston man was stung by a woolly worm 's long back hairs when he picked up his golf bag ; soon his whole left arm was throbbing with pain up to the armpit . Even with Demerol and Benadryl , he was still in pain and had a headache the next day . <P> The woolly slug is concentrated in eleven states from Maryland to Missouri and Texas , but it has close kin in the Northeast : the caterpillar of the white moth , Lagoa crispata . Other common stingers are the range and saddleback caterpillars , and those of the buck , lo , tussock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hairs may fly through the air in such numbers as to bring on asthma attacks in children who never even touch the beast directly .
