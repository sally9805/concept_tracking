txt The two young United States Navy officers who were in charge of the destroyer Frank E. Evans last week when : she collided with the Australian carrier Melbourne were warned today that they were " suspected of having negligently hazarded a vessel of the United States armed forces . " The warning was made by the counsel for the joint Australian - American board of inquiry Investigating the collisionl of June 3 , in which 74 crewmen of the Evans lost their lives . The warning , to Lieut. ( jg . ) James A. Hopson and Lieut. ' ( jg . ) Ronald Ramsey , was intended to protect the two officers under military law and not to raise charges against them . The board is authorized to determine facts , not to bring charges or make judgments . However . tle facts determined by the hoard could be used if the two officers were // brought to court-martial . If found guilty of the suspected negligence , they could be subject to a maximum penalty of two years ' imprisonment at hard labor and dishonorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lieutenant Hopson , who directed the final movements of the Evans before the collision in the China Sea , described . ! scene of extreme con : set and bewilderment on the bridge of the American ship . He testified that the Melbourne was not where he expected her to be after he turned the Evans in a maneuver intended to take the destroyer astern of the Australian carrier . Lieutenant Hopson said he believed that the Evans was to the right of the Melbourne when he started his movement and that the Australian carrier ( was on a south-southwesterly course . Testimony Differs Yesterday , however , Capt . John P. Stevenson , captain of the Melbourne , testified that when he ordered the Evans to change station , the American destroyer was to the left of his ship and that the aircraft carrier was on a course nearly due west . Lieutenant Hopson , a crewcut , blue-eyed , 28-year-old officer , who received his commisIsion after serving as an enlisted man , testified for about two hours today on the events preceding the collision . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directing the movement of the Evans . when the Melbourne signaled that his ship should change to a planeguard position 1,000 yards behind the carrier . A check of the " radar repeater " on ship 's bridge , he said , showed that the bearing of the Melbourne was 84 degrees , which means that the , carrier would have been to the right of the destroyer , nearly due east . To his knowledge , Mr. HopLieut. ( j. g . ) James A. Hopson after giving testimony son said , the base course , ' which is the prescribed basic direction of the task force , was 185 degrees , or nearly due south , and the actual course of the Melbourne was 205 degrees , or approximately southwest , at the time he was ordered to change station . Navigational directions begin at zero , representing due north , with 90 degrees standing for east , 180 for south and 270 for west . " Actual course " differs from " base course " at times because of temporary changes in headings . ' I Was Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , he ordered a- right turn , which he thought would take him safely away from the course of the Melbourne and into a course behind the carrier . He described the movement as " a very conservative decision . " Yesterday , however , Captain Stevenson asserted that the base course of the task force had been 220 degrees , or nearly southwest , and that the Melbourne 's actual course had been 260 degrees , almost due west . Lieutenant Hopson described what happened next . " When the ship came around to the right I took my first visual bearing on the Melbourne . I noticed that the Melbourne was drifting to the left instead of to the right . I was very confused at this time because I perfectly expected the Melbourne to be drifting to the right . " The Melbourne was a darkened ship . All I could see was its shadow . I could not tell the aspect of the ship which way it was headed . I told Ramsey that the Melbourne was drifting to the left and ordered a five-degree left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaker on our bridge a signal from the Melbourne : ' You are on a collision course . ' I turned and looked at Mr. Ramsey . Ramsey looked up and ordered ' right full rudder . ' ' Bright White Lights ' " I turned and looked at the Melbourne . She was drifting rapidly across our bow : She had bright white lights on her flight deck , mast and navigation lights . At that time I saw I was looking at the bow aspect and that the Melbourne was in very close proximity . I ordered the helmsman to place engines at ' all back full . ' " I ran to the side of the ' bridge shouting , ' She 's going to hit us ! She 's going to hit us ! I ran to the starboard . I saw a flash of light . I was hit solidly in the back and I was under water . " Lieutenant Hopson later testified that he did not call Comdr . Albert S. , the captain of the Evans , who was asleep at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledged that he had made no Warning signal when a collision seemed imminent . The Melbourne struck the Evans , slicing her in two , about 3:15 A.M. The bow section of the destroyer sank In about five minutes . In addition to the differences regarding base courses , actual courses and relative positions of the two ships , Lieutenant Hopson 's testimony contained a number *A discrepancies with the testimony given yesterday by Captain Stevenson of the Melbourne : CHe said he had received no signal from the Melbourne describing the carrier 's course after the order to change stations was given . But Captain Stevenson said that he had signaled his course as 260 degrees after he had ordered the station change . gLieutenant Hopson 's time schedule for zig-zag maneuvers the ships were conducting before the collision differed at several points with the schedules described by Captain Stevenson . CLieutenant Hopson said he had seen no lights on the carrier until virtually the moment of impact . The captain of the Melbourne said that he had or- ' dered his navigation lights on to full brilliance when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the difference In the base courses assumed by the Evans and the Melbourne was the crucial factor that led inexorably to the collision . The difference meant that all course and speed calculations made by the Evans were wrong for the position she expected to take in relation to the Melbourne . Although the hoard questioned Mr. Hopson on coding and decoding procedures , the reasons for the discrepancy on the base course were not explained . In testimony earlier today , Captain Stevenson appeared to ' be charging the Evans xi/Rh full responsibility for the collision . He outlined all the precautions that he said he had directed his escort destroyer to take in order to avoid collision With the carrier . " Despite the precautions , ' the unbelievable happened and my ship and crew were endangered , " he said . " 1 would have expected the Evans to take note of all precautions . Had attention been ! paid to even one of the precautions a collision never would have occurred . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
