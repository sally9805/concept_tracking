After the great blackout in the north eastern U.S. ( TIME cover , Nov. 19 ) , El Paso Electric Co . President Ray Lockhart , whose outfit serves a 13,200-sq. - mi. area of southwest Texas , southern New Mexico and the Mexican city of Ciudad Jurez , bragged that nothing like that could ever happen to his customers . Last week it did . <P> Blacked out for two hours were some 50 cities and towns , including El Paso , Ciudad Jurez , Truth or Consequences , Las Cruces and Alamogordo , New Mex . <P> The power failure also hit four military bases- Fort Bliss and Biggs Air Force Base in Texas , White Sands Missile Range and Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico- until emergency equipment cut in . The shutoff was traced to a malfunction in a regulator that feeds natural gas to the boilers in one of the company 's two steam-powered generating plants . That plant was closed down , and the other shut itself off under the increased load . El Paso 's red-faced Ray Lockhart hardly knew what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sputtered , " but it happened .
