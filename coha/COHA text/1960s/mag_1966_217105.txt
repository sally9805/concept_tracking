Smiled Ted Williams angelically : " I want to thank the writers for making all this possible . " That was about the only nice thing Ted has ever had to say about the press , but of course , the newsmen deserved it-since the Baseball Writers ' Association of America had just elected him to the Baseball Hall of Fame by a record vote of 282 out of 302 . There was no question he deserved it either . The last of the .400 sluggers ( .406 in 1941 ) , Ted hit 521 homers in 19 seasons with the Boston Red Sox , emerged with a career batting average of .344 . In fact , the Sox looked over the record again and were so impressed they hired Ted back-as a vice president of the club . <P> <P> Could it be that Charles de Gaulle had ever been young ? At a Books and Authors luncheon in Manhattan , former CBS Paris Correspondent David Schoenbrun was talking about his new biography , The Three Lives of Charles de Gaulle , and told one anecdote that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he , had a reputation as a ladies ' man once , even used to pursue the same demoiselles as his former comrade-in-arms Marshal Henri Ptain . Well , a friend asked the general in later years if the story was true . " Ah , oui , " De Gaulle answered . " Ptain and I were sometimes on the same terrain . But not on the same night . " <P> <P> Another series . Round-tripper Duke <P> at bat , " Four hundred feet from home-plate " ; <P> more like that . A neat bunt , please ; a cloud-breaker , <P> a drive like Jim Gilliam 's great big one . <P> Hope 's alive . <P> So sang Poetess Marianne Moore in her 1955 encomium to the Brooklyn <P> Dodgers , Hometown Piece for Messrs . Alston and Reese . Alas , even with a rooting muse like that , the team packed up for Los Angeles , leaving its poet in residence behind in Brooklyn , where she went on celebrating the borough , her " city of trees . " But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bums had gone West . Drunks rang her doorbell at 3 a.m. , and " one of my neighbors was robbed three times , " she complained . So , at 78 , after 35 years , Miss Moore moved to Greenwich Village , where a baseball diamond is very square . <P> <P> Mrs. William Howard , 51 , better known as Dorothy Lamour , hit the road once again , this time to exotic Chicago , where she slinked into the Drake Hotel 's Camellia House to try out an act sans Crosby and Hope . Far from Singapore , Zanzibar and Bali , Dottie wore shoes and a sequined gown , made it clear she 's said so long to sarongs . " No more flitting around the jungle , " she announced after leading a sing-along of Moonlight Bay and kissing a few pates around ringside . <P> <P> Perhaps it started in her girlhood when " some interfering person " decided that little Loelia Ponsonby must n't be taken to cowboy films any more because the flickers were bad for her eyes . Last week Loelia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco to pursue her old fascination . Her Grace announced that she wants to buy one authentic stagecoach , a covered wagon that had survived an Indian attack , a saloon door ( swinging ) and other fond wild West relics to install for English schoolchildren at a museum of Americana at Bath . <P>
