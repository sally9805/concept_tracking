Notes and Comment IT was just about a year ago on January 12 , 1959 , to be exact  --  that we tore off half a yard of the first page of the Herald Tribune and stuck it up on a wall in this office . The big headline that day had to do with a " first-class row " between Mr. Abe Stark , president of the City Council , and Mr. Lawrence E. Gerosa , the Comptroller . The two were hopping mad at each other  --  something about extravagance in the construction of public schools . The accompanying photographs of the indignant antagonists , though , were what interested us . Both men were grinning from ear to ear . Our magnifying glass , which we employ constantly as an aid to research , revealed that Mr. Stark was showing nine teeth and Mr. Gerosa seventeen . Mr. Stark was supposedly even angrier than Mr. Gerosa and no doubt could have shown as many teeth as Mr. Gerosa , if it were n't that Mr. Stark keeps his jaws together when he grins , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gerosa grins he lets his mouth gape open and shows both uppers and lowers . However , the point we 're making is that neither man had anything to grin about . The grins were inane . Well , all through 1959 we made a practice of tearing out pieces of the front page of the Herald Tribune and the other local newspapers whenever we came across politicians or statesmen or ex-statesmen showing their teeth in inane grins . For a month or so , we stuck these fragments of history on the wall of this office that held the StarkGerosa exhibit . When that wall was covered , we started on a second wall . About that time , we noticed that some of our fellow-workers had got into the habit of stopping by to look at our collection . After they had looked at it , they would look at us . They seemed concerned , and in a few cases alarmed . Consequently , we took the collection off the walls and stuffed it into a deep drawer of our desk , out of sight . In secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . By the end of November , the deep drawer would hold no more inane grins . In order to go ahead with the project , we bought a secondhand steamer trunk and put it on the floor , under a table . Then , nut long before Christmas , the Times walloped out a first page that made our modest collection look puny . On that single first page , the Tinies printed three separate photographs of politicians , statesmen , and ex-statesmen , in which a grand total of forty-three teeth were showing . In the first photograph , Senator Stuart Symington , Governor Edmund G. Brown , former Governor Adlai E. Stevenson , and Governor G. Mennen Williams were whooping it up , for no conceivable reason . In the second photograph , former President Harry S. Truman and former Socialist candidate Norman Thomas were inexplicably glistening at each other . In the third photograph , President Eisenhower and Premier Antonio Segni , of Italy , were grinning in an international setting . Under our magnifying glass , no teeth were visible in the third photograph . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were gaping open , though , and it seems safe to assume that each smiler got a clear view of the other 's uppers and lowers . In any event , the total of forty-three teeth , of all descriptions , that were discernible in the six other faces represents the record for 1959 . The Times won the prize hands down . That gives the other papers something to shoot at in 1960 . Independence FROM its name , you might suppose that the Skyline Motor Inn was a remote hideaway in the Puconos , or maybe even in the Great Smokies , but not a hit of it ; the skyline in question is Manhattan 's , and the inn is right over on Tenth Avenue , between Forty-ninth and Fiftieth Streets , in a section of town that may sound remote to some people but is might ) handy for the motorists whose custom the inn seeks . Designed in the sunniest Amurrican Modren style , the inn , which opened a couple of weeks ago , is five stories tall and boasts a hundred and thirty bedrooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop ; it also has the double distinction of being the first new hotel for transients to be built in Manhattan since the Waldorf went up in the dark abysm of 1931 and the first ever to be built in this borough h la motel , with free , built-in parking facilities for its guests . Not that its owner , an exuberant forty-six-year-old real-estate man named Harold Steinberg , can bear to hear the inn called either a hotel or a motel . " Those are ugly words to most contemporary travellers , " Mr. Steinberg told us when we stopped in at the inn to congratulate him upon its opening . " We 're a hotel only in the sense that we provide transient lodging , and a motel only in the sense that we provide on-the-premises parking . We 're an inn , which is to say that we give you comfortable shelter at a moderate price , with an absolute minimum of fuss and feathers . We also give you a feeling of independence . You never have the awful sensation that people are worrying about you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own bags , you fetch your own ice , with no fear of a host of bellhops buzzing busily about . " Mr. Steinberg fell silent , as if dazed by his own gift for alliteration , and then asked us , " Did it ever occur to you to wonder why Manhattan , a pandemonium of demolition and construction , has had no new hotels in nearly thirty years ? The reason is that most investors consider a hotel here a grave financial risk . The initial expense is enormous , compared to that required for an office building or apartment building of the same size , and the operational expense is a steady drain , bearing no relation to the sporadic nature of the local hotel trade . Now , why is it sporadic ? Why is the typical New York hotel filled all week and half empty all weekend ? Because of the sad fact that about seventy per cent of our hotel business comes from people who are here on business who have to be here and have to stay in hotels . Victims of necessity ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  people who visit the city because it 's fun . My solution to this problem is the motor inn , whose function is to make life as easy and pleasurable as it used to be . Simple means to a simple end ! For example , you confirm your reservation by loudspeaker as soon as you drive into the garage of the inn  --  no need to get out from behind the wheel . And from that moment until the moment you leave , you 're on your own . You do everything for yourself , just as if you were home ! " Mr. Steinberg 's rather peculiar-sounding formula must he as good as he thinks it is , because the inn has been chock-full of cheerful , hard-working homebodies ever since it opened . ( Double rooms range from fourteen to eighteen dollars a day . ) " People have obviously been starved for a place like this , " Steinberg said . " My associates and I are so pleased with the response that we 're already planning to build another inn , a little farther up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste of Tenth Avenue , and it might have been a green and golden paradise . " I 've come to love it here on the avenue , " he said . " It 's beautiful in the dark  --  so peaceful and quiet . My home is in Scarsdale , but I often spend the night here , to get away from that cooped-up , constantly-waited-on suburban atmosphere . " ? WEST COAST INTELLIGENCE ; The Rose Hills Memorial Park , in Hollywood , provides its patrons with pale-pink limousines and pale-pink hearses . Tranquillity , Etc . THE sensible , matter-of-fact  --  we almost said " down-to-earth " ? names given by the Russians to the areas they succeeded in photographing on the far side of the moon ( the Moscow Sea , the Soviet Mountains , and so on ) led us to wonder who had chosen the charmingly romantic names ( the Sea of Tranquillity , the Ocean of Storms , the extinct volcanic craters Julius Caesar and Alexander the Great ) for features of the near side of the moon , and this , in turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole question of moon geography . The moon is about a quarter the size of the earth and is , on an average night , some two hundred and thirty-eight thousand miles away from us ; what we see of it from here is about four-sevenths of its total surface  --  Munster cheese to the naked eye and a bleak landscape of mountains , craters , and darkling plains to the eye of the telescope . The branch of astronomy that deals with the study and mapping of the lunar surface is called selenography , after Selene , the Greek goddess of the moon , and the first important selenographer was Galileo , who in 1610 turned his newly invented telescope on the moon and drew a chart of its principal features . Since Galileo 's telescope magnified only thirty times , his chart was n't very accurate . As the century went on and more powerful telescopes were developed , other astronomers made better maps of the moon , and the most precise of these was one that appeared in 1647 , in a book called " Selenographia , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Having spent six long years peeping at Selene from an observatory on the roof of his house , Hevelius appears to have wasted little time thinking up clever names for her various points of interest ; instead , he merely called them after their earthly equivalents  --  lunar Alps for our Alps , a lunar Etna for our Etna . This simple procedure caused considerable confusion among astronomers , and , except for the lunar mountain ranges , the Hevelian nomenclature was abandoned in favor of a system devised by a Bolognese Jesuit priest and astronomer , Giovanni Riccioli , who in 1651 published a two-volume work entitled " Almagestum Novum ; " this included a detailed telescopic study of the moon and introduced a system of names based on figures in history , mythology , philosophy , and astronomy . Among the bigger craters noted in the " Almagestum " were not only Julius Caesar and Alexander the Great but Atlas , Hercules , Plato , and , not too surprisingly , Riccioli . The great plains of the moon are always dark , and in the seventeenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who gave the eleven major waterless seas of the moon their entrancing names  --  Mare Serenitatis ( Sea of Serenity ) , Mare Crisium ( Sea of Crises ) , Mare Tranquillitatis ( Sea of Tranquillity ) , Mare Nectaris ( Sea of Nectar ) , Oceanus Procellarum ( Ocean of Storms ) , and the rest . Hevelius 's map of the moon , hearing Riccioli 's place names , sufficed until 1775 , when a German astronomer named Tobias Mayer produced a much better one ; four years afterward , another German , Johann Schriiter , outdid Mayer , and in 1838 the German astronomers Wilhelm Beer and Johann Heinrich von Madler produced a book , " Der Mond , " that was accompanied by the most detailed map of the moon up to that time . For centuries , astronomers had speculated on whether the moon was able to sustain life , or even volcanic activity . Beer and 11,1Rdler pronounced it utterly dead , but a few years later one of the many craters that they had recorded  --  it was located in the Sea of Tranquillity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carl von Untie ( Linnaeus ) was found by yet another German astronomer , Julius Schmidt , to have suddenly vanished from the face of the moon , Ieaving in its place a large white spot . Because of this peculiar event , Schmidt argued that there was certainly activity on the moon , if only an occasional moonquake , and while the mystery of LinruYs disappearance has never been satisfactorily explained , most contemporary astronomers tend to agree with Schmidt that the old satellite is n't altogether defunct . With the advent of photography , mapping the moon became much easier and also much more complex . In 1850 , a New York man , John Draper , completed the first photographic study of the moon ; since then a number of increasingly detailed atlases have been produced , the latest having been published in 1951 by the well-known English astronomer Dr. H. Percy Wilkins . Most authorities believe that Dr. ' Wilkins ' work will remain the standard lunar guide until surveyors actually land on the moon 's surface and set up their tripods in the Sea of Nectar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and seas , there are some five hundred other moon sites with officially recognized names , and the Russians are now in a position to supply several hundred more . Among Americans for whom sites have been named up yonder were E. C. and W. H. Pickering , of the Harvard College Observatory ; Simon Newcomb , of the Naval Observatory in Washington , D.C. ; and Benjamin Franklin , after whom a crater was named in 1838 . The Birthday Cake WE ran into a young Park Avenue mother of our acquaintance on an escalator at Bloomingdale 's during one of the last , feverish shopping days before Christmas , and , guiding us into a turbulent cove on the lee side of Bar Accessories , fourth floor , she poured Out to us a sad tale of her efforts to throw a small birthday party the week before for her small daughter 's two kittens , named Roughie and Toughie . The kittens were going to he a year old , and she telephoned a neighborhood bakery to order a small cake , asking that it be inscribed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She was told that this would n't fit on a small cake . " Happy Birthday , comma , Kittens , " she suggested . Still too long . " All right , " she said . " Make it ' Happy Birthday , comma , Cats . ' " flanging up the phone , she explained to her daughter that , being a year old , the kittens were now cats . This explanation was accepted graciously . Then , on the appointed day , the cake was sent over . The inscription had no comma , and it said " Happy Birthday , Katz . " We offered the young mother the season 's condolences and plunged on in search of a Martini mixer that does n't play a tune when you tilt it . Modest President WE called on Mrs. John D. Rockefeller III , the new president of the Museum of Modern Art , the other afternoon , at her apartment , on Beekman Place , and found her a tall , slender , poised , candid , unaffected woman , with a nice voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got married , had four children , became a Vassar trustee , and , around ten years ago , began to collect modern art . " I think I started out because I wanted something to cut loose on , " she said . " I may have been influenced by Johnny 's mother , who had begun collecting on her own ; the Museum of Modern Art grew out of that . All of us girls really adored our mother-in-law . There were four of us ; Nelson 's wife was the first , then me , then Laurance 's wife , then David 's . She was such a human person , and so interested in her daughters-in-law . We 'd sit and knit and talk about things . Well , one of the first purchases I made was a bronze horse by Marino Marini  --  I ordered it from Italy after Alfred Barr showed me a photograph of it  --  and it arrived in the elevator one day . It did n't go very well with what we had , so it was put in a storeroom downstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , so I got Philip Johnson , whose architecture I admire very much , to remodel a little house on East Fifty-second Street into a gallery and guesthouse . I paid for it with my own money , which I also used to buy paintings and sculptures , and I later gave it to the Museum , which does some of its entertaining there . I learned a lot working with Philip on the house ; it was like a laboratory lesson in modern design . I had great fun with it ; the whole family went to spend the weekend there one time . The Marini horse is still in the house , though it still belongs to me . " We asked Mrs. R. when her work with the Museum began , and she said that in 1949 , at the instance of Nelson Rockefeller , who was then its president , she set up its Junior Council , to bring young people in . " Nelson wanted to get new blood into the Museum , " she said . " I think he felt that some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place . The Council . which grew to thirty or forty people , started the Art Lending Service , among other things . Beth Straus  --  Mrs. Donald Straus  --  succeeded me as chairman , and in 1955 , by which time I was a trustee , I got into another Museum body , the International Council . The Museum had been running circulating ex-hibits around the country and in Canada  --  an impor-tant and successful program , directed by Porter Mc-Cray  --  and in 1950 the trustees had the idea of do-ing this on a worldwide basis . The question of fi-nanccs came up , and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund made a five-year grant to get it started . It did very well indeed  --  it sponsored Museum exhibits all over the world  --  hut by the last year that the grant covered no provision had yet been made for its future financ-ing . Foundations like to start things , you know , and then have them go along on their own . So we talked about it , and formed the Inter-national Council to further the pro-gram . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; we now have eighty-eight , from all parts of the country . They 're a wonderful group of people . Meanwhile , the Rockefeller Brothers Fund had made another five-year grant , but on a diminishing basis ; in another year or two , it will come to zero . Well , I got the International Council sort of started , and a couple of years ago Eliza Parkinson  --  Mrs. Bliss Parkinson  --  succeeded me as its president . The Council is doing all kinds of exciting things , such as trying to get good art hung in American em-bassies . Douglas Dillon , whose wife is one of our trustees , was very helpful when he was Ambassador in Paris . " Looking pleased at the thought of Douglas Dillon , Mrs. Rockefeller con-tinued , " When I resigned from that , I took a year or so off from the Museum . I 'd been on a number of its committees . I especially enjoyed the Collections Com-mittee , over which Alfred Barr presides ; he 's a professor at heart , and exudes in-formation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board , but I sort of extricated myself for a breather . Then the old magic of the Museum got after me , and last spring , when Nelson had to leave as chairman of the board  --  Jock Whitney had had to resign this post earlier , when he was wafted into public life  --  I was put in as chairman . Bill Burden was president , and then he had to leave , this fall , to become Ambassador to Belgium . We were horrified . We 'd lost three of our major officers in a few years . We were about to start this **26;1836;TOOLONG fund drive , and we could n't be without a president . So 1 , kind of by default , slipped in , and Henry Allen Moe became chairman . I think the justification for having a woman president is that men are too busy . " We asked Mrs k. how often she goes to her office in the Museum , and she said she does n't have any office . " There is n't room , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of my Japanese friends  --  my husband and I are very much interested in Japan , and I 've been there with him eight times  --  was here a few days ago . He was frightfully impressed with my heing president of the Museum and wanted to call on me at my office ; I had to confess the truth to him . I meet once a week with Rene d'Harnoncourt , the director of the Museum , and sit in his office . If I may make one point about the Museum , it 's that it hashad an extraordinary career for the last thirty years , and it 's very important that , from here on , it should n't lose its quality of freshness . I think there 's too much of the status-seeker approach to art . We must put on exhibits that make people think for themselves . " We asked Mrs. Rockefeller about her interest in Japan  --  she had received us in a small library , and we 'd noted , in an adjacent hall , many shelves of books on Japanese art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first took me there in 1951 , when he went out as cultural adviser to Mr. Dulles on the Peace Treaty Mission . We began to realize how important it was to try to undo the hatred between our two countries . Later , I took some courses in Oriental history at Columbia  --  I went there three winters , and I took the last course Sir George Sansom gave in Japanese cultural history  --  and I got within six points of getting an M.A. You need thirty points . The trouble was I had to stop in the middle of an Oriental-art course to go to Asia . We generally go in January and February , and I think we 've made a number of friends there . We took two of our children with us on one trip , and one of them , John , has been living in Tokyo for the past three years . The bug really bit him . He 's going to be an Oriental specialist of some sort . We keep having our friends here meet our visiting Asian friends . The Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it 's a little uphill , but it 's a joy to be with them and try to make them feel at home ; they 're so appreciative . It 's all very nebulous , but the Japan Society and the Asia Society have grown out of this  --  my husband is president of them and I think it adds up to good feeling , perhaps . " It has also added up , we learned , to more of an eye-to-eye attitude toward art on the part of Mrs. Rockefeller and her husband . " Johnny was a little standoffish about abstract art when I began to collect it , hut , through the Orient , we have come closer together in our feeling for art , " she said . " He has always admired Japanese art , which , especially in its calligraphy , is very closely related to abstract art , and he now sees a little more beauty in the understatement of abstract art . And I 've become terribly interested in his collection of Asian art . " She showed us a serene , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our raising a fiscal point , said that her extra-Rockefeller money comes from her father , the late Elon Huntington Hooker , who was a direct descendant of Thomas Hooker , one of the founders of the Connecticut Colony . Elon Hooker was active in timber , mining , railroads , chemicals , and hydraulic engineering . " Father worked his way through the University of Rochester and later took a Ph.D . at Cornell , " she said . " Then he did more graduate work , in Zurich and Paris . He started the Hooker Chemical Corporation , in Niagara Falls , and it is still a good corn pany . " As she showed us to the elevator , she said , " It 's sheer recreation working for the ' Museum , and I should n't get any credit for it . " ?
