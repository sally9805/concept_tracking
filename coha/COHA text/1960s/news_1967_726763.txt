txt Letters to the Editor of The Times ELIAS M. SCHWARZBART New York , Dec. 5 , 1967JOSEPH EULIEROBIN BERNHOFTABRAHAM pg . 46 Letters to the Editor of The Times President Supported . To the Editor : The attacks on President Johnson for moving Secretary of Defense to the presidency of the World Bank are unprecedented for sheer meanness and unprincipled vindictiveness . No one but the principals knows the true facts . But . I have every confidence - that it will transpire that the President has acted out of generosity , gratitude and genuine concern for Mr. 's future . I happen to be one of those " intellectuals " who admire and trust the President for his democratic aspirations and for his firm resolve and quiet dignity in the face of adversity . He is by the New Deal out of Southern Populism and is to me the authentic voice of Americari-pragmatic idealism in ' a time of revolutionary change . - He has grown greatly in the Presidency and has already achieved enough to mark him as one of our truly great and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our history . As a nation , we are paying the price for the terrible errors and neglects . of the past . Although Mr. Johnson has already done more than any other President to catch up with history and The ? moral imperatives of our times , the impasse in Vietnam has ironically cast a momentary shadow on his achievements and has turned the nation 's frustration against him . Let him be consoled that Lincoln , too , experienced this anguish during the dark days of the Civil War . I remain hopeful that the President will , find a way to solve the Vietnam problem . Whether he will be re-elected ' President I do not know , but this I do know ? he deserves to be and the country needs him . ELIAS M. SCHWARZBARr New York , Dec. 5 , 1967 Cardinal ' Spellman To the Editor : Your . Dec. 4 editorial concerning Cardinal Spellman 's death was offensive to the millions of Catholics and nonCatholics who mourn the loss of a great man . In castigating him for disagreeing with you on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you condemn him for . Moreover , one does not take issue with a dead person at a time when he is being mourned . This is the occasion for charity . It would have been more in keeping with the canons of good taste and The Times ' tradition for you to have eulogized him as a fine churchman , warm human being and a sometime gallant opponent . JOSEPH LULIE Associate Professor of Education and Social Science State University College New Paltz , N. Y. , Dec. 4 , 1967 Graduate Deferments To the Editor : As a college senior majoring in history I was fascinated and thrilled by the National Security Council 's announcement that my career is not in the national interest . I am , of course , thoroughly pleased that scientists and mathematicians have been given the nod ; for I believe that dullness , lack of imagination , and ability to adhere to method should have their reward . The machine people get so little out of life that they deserve some compensation . I only regret that it is at my expense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor the construction of larger bombs and deadlier weapons over the accumulation of economic and political knowledge competent to solve the most dangerous problems of bur era . As a rich nation , we stand fair to be engulfed by the poor of ' the world , unless we are willing and able to tackle problems of population control and economic development . As a powerful , nation , we stand to be bled by countless Vietnams unless we are willing and able to train and develop statesmen . In a clear evaluation of national interest , economists and diplomatists mean more to national interests than do physicists or engineers . Where are the deferments for ? people whose desire is to prevent catastrophe , not engineer it ? What of our future leaders , of whom so much is heard ? In the ? past most of them have gone to law school . Are not they part of a vital national interest ? Winston Churchill never programed a computer . I submit that a scientific mind could never have saved England in 1940 . What vital national interests are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N.S.C. . is beyond description . All I can say is the assumptions behind the system of graduate deferments insult my sensibilities and betray the stupidity of our Government officials . Roarrl - EnNHorr Cambridge , Mass. , Dec. 4 , 1967 For a Safer City To the Editor : In your Nov. 29 editorial on " Crime in the Streets " you suggest the strengthening of the volunteer auxiliary police . As a. former member of the New York City Corps ( early in World War II until my induction into the army in 1943 ) , I would understand the hesitancy of citizens to join any street patrol that has to face ruthless murderers . Instead , reliable citizens of all creeds and races , preferably veterans , should be ' organized and deputized to assist the police , with the right to carry weapons . The survival of the metropolis depends on safety in the streets . The middle class of all races will not remain in the city under present conditions . The rich can afford it . The poor have no choice . Without safety in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or economic class . ABRAHAM G. DUKER Professor of History and Social Institutions Yeshiva University New York , Nov. 30 , 1967 School Programs for Gifted To the Editor : The New York City Board of Education will shortly hold hearings on the budgetary requests of the various school districts . In announcing these hearings , the Superintendent of Schools encloses a letter to the members of the Board outlining the common elements to be discerned in the requests of the various districts . Item eight states : " Very few districts indicated a need for personnel to provide additional services for the ' gifted ' child . " This is indeed a surprising statement from the head of a school system that has pioneered the slogan . " Quality Education . " I would think that no matter how compelling the need in other areas , we can not afford ' to neglect the future leadership of our nation . " I further question the wisdom of allowing plans for the education of the gifted to hinge on community demand . It seems to me that there is a clear-cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that important areas of the educational program are not slighted . We have many programs with most attractive titles ? " talent search , " " college bound , " " higher horizons , " etc . How about some plain " bread-and-butter " programs for more of our gifted children ? JOSEPH H. AARON President . Junior Principals Association Brooklyn , Dec. 3 , 1967 Soviet Ban on . . Emigration of Jews To the Editor : Dec. 3 marked the , first anniversary of a major humanitarian policy statement of the Soviet Government which , regrettably , is currently being observed in the breach . Premier . A. N. Kosygin told a Paris press conference that day that for those Soviet citizens wishing " to leave the Soviet Union " for the pUrpose of being reunited with their families abroad " the road is open to them and no problem exists here . " The text of these remarks was printed in Pravda and Izvestia two days later , therewith giving them official status . The Soviet Premier was responding in Paris to a question concerning Soviet Jews . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad , as " was done for many Greek and Armenian families " ? The positive and encouraging answer of the Premier was applauded by men of goodwill everywhere as a gesture of sympathy for the remnants of Jewish families who had been splintered and fragmented by the Nazi hordes . If for a period of time the Soviet regime initiated implementation of this policy , unfortunately since the Middle East war in June such effort has come to an end . Jews desirous of leaving to join a remaining brother , uncle or cousin hi , Israel are now forbidden ter ' so . Only a trickle is permitted to enter the United States . Certainly this abridgment of humanitarian pronouncement ' ' annot but cast a shadow upon , - the celebrations . surrounding ; , . tie fiftieth anniversary of the ; Soviet . regime . Furthermore , refusal to allow Jews to emigrate to join. ? their families abroad flouts the fundamental principles of the ' United Nations and , of international law . Article 13 ( paragraph ' , 2 ) of the Universal . Declaration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tight to , leave any country , : including his own . . . . " The Covenant on. , Civil and'Political Rights , adopted , by the U.N . General Assembly with the U.S.S.R. casting a " yes " vote , requires in Article 12 that " everyone shall , be free to leave any country , including his owti . " The U.N . Subcommission ' on Prevention of- , Discrimination and Protection of Minorities in 1963 , approved a study Whi'c'h formally called . upon all governments to take " due regard " of the humanitarian principle of " reunion of ' families " in ? granting the right of citizens-4to emigrate . Reunion of Families .. The Soviet Union , as ' , the questioner at Premier Kogygires Paris press conference tioted , has had a progressive outlOdis on reunion of its ** Armenian families . ThiscrWas also the case with referelce " to Spaniards who had beenresiding in the U.S.S.R. and who , had wished to return to Spain. , On April 29 , 1958 , a leading 8oxiet journal ( Lituraturnaya Gaeta ) stated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to share its , destiny , its struggle as hard , is4 may be . Let us wish them luck . " One year later , the Soviet Foreign Minister , Andrel , - GrZ ) - myko , exchanged letters with the United States Vice President in which support for the " principles of nonseparation of ' hinnies " was made explicit ' on both sides . It is tragic that Soviet authorities are today making an exception for the people who were the principal victims of the Nazi holocaust . On this ' anniversary of the forward-looking statement of the Soviet Premier , we appeal to him to fulfill its promise . The undersigned express their concern from a long experience with the problems and /this of minority people . ROGER BALDWIN A. PHILIP RANDOC , H NORMAN THOMAS New York , Dec. 4 , ' I96,7 Tipless Taxi Riders ? . To the Editor : David H. Engel 's Dec. 5 , letter on taxi finances raises ' an interesting question . He writes , " Real income ' includes Wages plus tips . " Can anyone for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $1 or more are going to burden themselves further with - tips ? what , under the circumstances , would the tip be for ? R. HEVLBUT Bradley Beach , N. J.
