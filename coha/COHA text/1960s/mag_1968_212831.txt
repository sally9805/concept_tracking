COLLEGE BASKETBALL <P> It was billed as the rematch of the decade : the University of Houston , No. 1 - ranked college basketball team , against No. 2 U.C.L.A. in the semifinals of the N.C.A.A. championship at Los Angeles . Last year in the same N.C.A.A. round , U.C.L.A. whipped Houston by a score of 73-58 and went on to win the championship . Then , last January , Houston turned the tables with a startling 71-69 midseason upset that knocked the Bruins from the No. 1 ranking and smashed their 47-game winning streak . Now it was Houston with its own 32-game winning streak on the line , and U.C.L.A. was the one thirsting for revenge . <P> Rematch ? Mismatch was more like it . By game time , the odds makers had installed U.C.L.A. as an eight-point fa vorite on the strength of a tougher schedule and no losses since the Houston upset . But no one remotely expect ed anything like the slaughter that followed . Attacking from the first tipoff , Coach John Wooden 's Bruins outran , outpassed , outshot , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Houston 69 . <P> Five Doubles . When the slaughter was over , the first question was how Houston could ever have beaten U.C.L.A. The second was why the sportswriters could have considered the January game anything but a fluke , a good team catching a great team on a very off night . Without making excuses , U.C.L.A. 's Coach Wooden at the time pointed out that 7-ft . If - in . Lew Alcindor was still seeing double , after an eye injury , that Guard Mike Warren , the team 's playmaker , was weak with flu . <P> Last week Wooden 's Bruins were all healthy , and hungry as their name . Every one of the five starters scored in double figures , played with poise , aggressiveness and precision rarely seen outside the pros . There was Alcindor , pounding Houston shots right back at the shooters , sinking soft hooks , seizing 18 rebounds and clearing the lane for the driving lay-ups of Lucius Allen ; Mike Warren , brilliant with his passing and playmaking ; Lynn Shackelford , killing the Cougars with his left-handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matching Allen and Alcindor with 19 points . <P> Houston 's 6-ft. 8-in . Elvin Hayes , who had pumped in 39 points in the January game , was so closely guarded that he scored only 10 points . His teammates fared no better . Pressed everywhere on the court , Houston threw passes out of bounds , dribbled on the baseline , managed to lose the ball 24 times on mistakes . <P> It could have been worse . When the U.C.L.A. lead reached an astonishing 44 points with 5 min. to go , Wooden mercifully removed his starters one by one . Alcindor left with 2:04 to play , and raised his long right arm high in the air with the index finger extended to signify No. 1 . Who could argue ? Said Houston Coach Guy Lewis : " That was the greatest exhibition of basketball I 've ever seen in my life . " <P> For U.C.L.A. , it meant an unprecedented fourth N.C.A.A. championship in five years-although to make it official the Bruins did have to report for the Saturday night finals , where their superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team 78-55.
