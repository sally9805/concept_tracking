Leopoldville was named after a Belgian king , Elisabethville after a Belgian queen , and Stanleyville after the American journalist who presumed it was Dr. Livingstone . Such names could only remind the Congolese of their colonial past and so , when independence came , it was just a matter of time before they were changed . The time has arrived . President Joseph Mobutu last week decreed that , as of July 1 , Elisabethville will be called Lubumbashi ( because it is on the Lubumba River ) , Stanleyville will revert to its pre-Belgian name Kisangani , and Leopoldville , the capital , will become Kinshasa-a corruption of the Bafununga phrase for " Why do you ask ? " The result is bound to be several years of nominal confusion , but at least the cause of African nationalism has been served .
