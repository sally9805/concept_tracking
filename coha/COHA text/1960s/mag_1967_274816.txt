Times change , and so does the Supreme Court-sometimes quite rapidly . In 1952 , during Senator Joseph McCarthy 's heyday , the court confirmed the validity of New York State 's Feinberg Law , barring subversives from the public-school system . The matter seemed settled then and there . Last week the court ruled again on the Feinberg Law . This time it reversed itself , ruling by a vote of 5 to 4 that the law is now unconstitutional . Such short-term reversal is not unprecedented , but it does require agile rethinking on the court 's part . The 1952 case , decided by a 6-3 majority , did not speak to the 1967 issue raised by three New York State University faculty members who deliberately refused to sign a loyalty oath in order to test the law . Another university employee also refused the oath . Their points were that " pertinent constitutional doctrines have since rejected the premises upon which " the earlier conclusion rested and that the law is unconstitutionally vague . Pursuing the first point for the majority , Justice William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oath requirement of the Feinberg Law , it still bars from public-school employment members of any organization that advocates the violent overthrow of the Government . Even if the employee does not share the advocacy , he must still be fired under Feinberg , said Brennan , and that is " guilt by association . " <P> Regulatory Maze . Moreover , the law would also remove from school employ anyone guilty of " treasonable or seditious " utterances or acts . Here , said Justice Brennan , " the difficulty centers upon the meaning of ' seditious . ' " Constructing a reductio ad absurdum , he traced how the law might conceivably include even a teacher who publicly displayed the Communist Manifesto by merely carrying a copy of it on the street . " It is no answer , " added Brennan , " to say that the statute would not be applied in such a case . " The law is plagued by such vagueness , he concluded , and constitutes a " regulatory maze " in which a teacher would rightly be uncertain of just what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt of the legitimacy of New York 's interest in protecting its educational system from subversion , " but its law has not been defined narrowly enough and therefore infringes too heavily on the First Amendment guarantee of free speech .
