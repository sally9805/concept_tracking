? PART TWO W hen Sen. Thomas Dodd 's official financial report failed to account for almost a quarter of a million dollars that he had collected ostensibly for his successful campaign for re-election in 1964 , I was reluctantly forced to the conclusion that he was engaged in calculated fraud . Four other members ( or former members ) of Dodd 's staff agreed with my decision that Ae had a duty to expose the senator 's corruption . It had been a hard decision to reach . I had spent 12 years working for Dodd , and was his adminrttrative assistant in December , 1964 , when he angrily dismissed me ( though he secretly kept me on his payroll for five more months while trying to persuade me to rejoin his staff ( . A second . almc6t equally hard problem , was : Whom do you go to to expose a senator ? The Senate itself had nearly always avoided investigating one of its own me ? bers . The FBI was beholden to Dodd for past favors and needed his goodwill for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case to Dodd 's ultimate employer , the public . After consulting my colleagues in this endeavor. 1 accordingly made an appointment to see Jack Anderson . Drew Pearson 's associate on the widely syndicated column . Washington Merry-Go-Round . It was May 20 , 1965 , when I drove to Anddson 's office in downtown Washington . On Capai , Hill Anderson 's victims call him " Dirty Jac-k ) but I found him rather handsome , in a clean-ca way . and decidedly agreeable . In an attempt to 0 1968 by J  --  rook Boyd . From 0* tOrIbioming book , " ab , hr ? t " . " SC to Oa pubil  --  hed by The Now Am  --  ricro Library , Inc. put me at ease , he rambled with disarming frankness about personal matters  --  his eight children , the Sunday-school class he taught , his relationship with Drew Pearson . and about his mission as an investigative reporter : " Every time we expose one chiseler in Congress , a dozen others that we ca n't get the goods on straighten up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my story , he listened intently . I sped through an abbreviated recital of our evidence of misconduct , skimming over my notes and mentioning only the highlights . Even so , two hours passed . When I finished , I was overcome by a feeling that the events I cited must have seemed insignificant . " Do you think there is anything here ? " I asked . " If tine can substantiate half of this , " he replied , " it wilt be the most significant disclosure of corruption in Washington in forty years . " A working relationship thus began . I went to Anderson 's office almost daily and dictated my notes in full to his secretary . Opal Ginn , a tall , talkative lady with an infectious warmth and a remarkably proficient shorthand . The notes soon amounted to more than 100 typed pages . During the early days of our association the guidelines were drawn . Anderson would treat the Dodd story as a top-priority matter and would be available at any time of the night or day to work on it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We agreed that I would receive no remuneration of any kind , either for the informa lion 1 provided or for the work I dill in developing it , for nothing iniFt he alli mud to taint our revelations or discredit our motives . That was to apply equally to Marjorie Carpenter , Dodd 's former secretary , who had been fired the same clay I was ; and to Michael O'Hare , the senator 's bookkeeper , and Terry Golden , a staff secretary , who were both still employed in Dodd 's office . Nothing would be published until every scrap of available information was in , and then we would inform the Senate and the FBI of all that we knew . Anderson , for his part , committed himself to do all within his power to lay the case before the public and the authorities , and to persevere in it no matter what pressures were brought to bear on him . I agreed to provide sworn affidavits whenever needed , and to testify in any legal forum , and I expressed confidence that everyone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeded in relating the individual episodes , the more apparent became the need for documentation . " I believe what you tell me , " Anderson would say , " but we ca n't go to press on that basis . Some of this we can print . based on your testimony and the others ' ; but for most of it I need proof of some kind that I can show to Drew and our lawyers . " For months the key to Dodd 's office , which my former secretary , Judy Berling , had procured , had lain beside my telephone , a daily reminder of what was ahead . At last that moment had come . To invade Dodd 's office and remove his files was an ugly business . Anderson always stopped short of recommending it ; but there was no other way to get the proof . I was aware of the ethical questions involved , if not the legal ones . But I concluded that traditional concepts of civil liberties . developed with reference to the rights of private citizens versus the state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public . Certainly an elected official has no right to conceal his conduct in office from his constituents , in whose name he acts . The office he holds belongs to the people , and his actions in it are to a large extent public property . If the functions of a public office are misused , the public has a paramount right to know about it . When an erring senator will not open his records voluntarily  --  and Senate committees and the Justice Department refuse to subpoena them  --  then the public has no way to acquire the information that rightfully belongs to it unless an individual with inside knowledge takes the burden upon himself . Should one shrink from this burden , when to do so means that massive wrongdoing will go undetected ? I concluded that this was a unique situation for which I knew of no precedents . Actually , as Sen. Stephen Young of Ohio reminded his colleagues last July , a resolution adopted by both houses of Congress in 1958 stated , in part : " All Government servants must expose corruption wherever discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Senator Young went on to say that this portion of the joint resolution " appears to me to definitely place a direct obligation on the employees of senators and congressmen or any other Government servants to report publicly any corruption or wrongdoing to the prejudice of our Government . " y At any rate , I judged that the larger ends of justice would be served by my trespassing in Dodd 's office and removing all files containing evidence of misconduct , and after some weeks of unavoidable delay , we planned our document raid for Saturday , June 12 . Dodd had left for Connecticut for the weekend , and , according to Michael 's best information , no one would be in the senator 's office on either Saturday or Sunday . While waiting for the late afternoon , when our entry into Dodd 's office would be the least subject to detection , Marjorie and I went to see Jack Ander son for a final huddle . fa -. manor was that of a patriotic archbishop 1. m the troops as they leave for the battlefield . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think it can , therefore , be legally wrong , " he began softly . " In good conscience I ca n't urge you young people to take this risk that 's entirely up to you . But I must warn you of the consequences . If you 're caught at it today , you may be ruined . And even if you do n't get caught , and we get all the documents and are completely successful in exposing Dodd , it will all come out when you testify , as you well know , and it will follow you all your lives , You may be all through in Washington . Dodd will pressure the Senate and the Justice Department to go after you , make no mistake about that , and it will be touch and go . " But if you do take this chance " ? now the old missionary ardor sounded in his voice ? " Drew and I will never abandon you , and we have fifty million readers . We 'll protect the documents . and we 'll print all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It they want to prosecute you . they 'll have to prosecute Drew and me too . " As Jack escorted us to the door , he added a few words of down-to-earth advice . " Those doors in the Senate Office Building , " he said expertly . " do n't they have inside locks that ca n't be opened from the outside ? " " Yes , I think they do . " I said . " Well , the minute you get in Dodd 's office , lock all the doors from the inside . If anyone tries to get in , tiptoe up to the door and listen carefully . They 'll have to go back to the police office to get help . Wait until you hear the footsteps die away in the hall . then run for it with the documents . the quickest way out . If all goes well , call me. but keep your comments guarded . Always assume that the phones are tapped , especially mine . " There are five entrances to the Old Senate Office Building that lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first floor . At each entrance there is a police desk and an officer on duty . Among the tasks of these gentlemen , especially at night and on weekends , is that of carefully observing all who enter and leave the building . We had scheduled our raids for periods when Dodd 's offices were most likely to be empty , but these were also the periods of minimum traffic in the building , when our comings and goings would be the most conspicuous . At 5:45 P.M. , Marjorie and I passed through the Delaware and C Street entrance , and nodded with pretended familiarity to the officer on duty . who returned our nod routinely . The policeman was new and gave no indication of interest in us . Then we started down the long hallway , our footsteps echoing in the void . We each carried an empty valise. mine almost the size of a suitcase . As we passed the offices of Dodd 's next-door neighbor , Sen. Paul Douglas of Illinois , a comparison between the two was unavoidable . For 16 years Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was well-known throughout the Senate . He accepted a modest scale of life , and each year made public his total income and net worth . He refused to accept from contributors a single dollar , under any guise , for his personal expenses . He returned all gifts , however innocent . that were worth more than five dollars . And he refused campaign contributions from any person or group with a financial interest in any matter before him as a senator . Dodd 's suite consisted of a long string of interconnected offices . each with a door opening on the hall . When we reached our destination , we saw light shining through the transoms of two of the offices . Was someone in there ? Five minutes earlier we had phoned Dodd 's office , and there had been no answer . Probably someone had been there earlier in the day and had failed to turn off the lights . We would have to take our chances . We continued down the hall to the entrance farthest from the lighted rooms . I turned the key silently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed the door quietly behind us . We listened for sounds coming from the other end of the suite and moved silently through an outer office , through mine , to the edge of Dodd 's sanctuary , where two small lamps burned dimly . The room seemed to exude Dodd 's presence . We stepped across the threshold and looked anxiouslytoward his desk , fully expecting to see him sitting there , staring at us . The room was vacant , however , and so were the rooms where we had seen the lights . I moved quickly from door to door , turning all the inside locks . The one on the door to Dodd 's personal office was broken , but the doorstop , when pressed all the way to the floor , caught in the edge of the carpeting and seemed to hold fast , though I could not tell how much force this makeshift arrangement would withstand . Marjorie was thoroughly familar with the filing system and soon began deluging me with stacks of letters bearing names we had been discussing for months  --  Klein , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leafed through them , hurriedly deciding what was important , and stacked the folders to be removed on the red-leather divan in Dodd 's office . Our immediate success somewhat dazzled us . We whispered our linds to each other excitedly , until we realized that this was slowing us down . Though the full significance of all that I was stacking up on the divan must . I knew , await further study , particular documents jolted me with the excitement of discovery . There was , for instance , a paper listing the names of two dozen corporations that had been assisted by Dodd in obtaining Government contracts and whose officers had made large contributions to him ; in the margins were occasional hand-written notes showing the extent of their generosity . And there were many copies of thank-you notes from the senator acknowledging gifts received from television executives , lobbyists and businessmen dealing with the Government . Almost always , the gift givers had a direct stake in Dodd 's official acts . " I have the folders containing Ed Sullivan 's weekly reports to the senator , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dodd 's chief money raiser . " They should tell a lot about the fund-raising . " The sound of heavy footsteps outside cut short our mood of celebration , But they passed by . " Let 's stay another half hour . " I said . " We 've got almost as much as we can carry . " A t eight o'clock we packed up . Soon the approaching dusk would reveal to passersby on Constitution Avenue , and perhaps to the Capitol Hill police , that something strange was going on in Senator Dodd 's lighted office . The files that we could not squeeze into the valises we carried loose . We were comically overloaded and , on coming out of Dodd 's office . we would be visible the entire length of the hall . I opened the door a crack and listened . Hearing nothing , we slipped out into the hall and in a few minutes were past the police desk and safely back in our car . We drove straight to Marjorie 's apartment , where we spent several hours classifying the documents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At about 2 A.M. we reached the folders filled with Ed Sullivan 's handwritten letters , more than 200 in all . Among these we found three financial reports on the 1961 Dodd dinner in Hartford , which showed , in ledger form , that $64,000 had been raised , and that the entire net proceeds , $56,000 , had been sent to Dodd in Washington and deposited in his personal bank account . For the first time we had documentary proof of what heretofore we had known only by deduction . Of the quarter-million dollars in political funds which we estimated Dodd had expropri. ated. more than one fifth was now accounted for . At eight o'clock Sunday morning we drove into I he underground garage of the New Senate Office Building and parked near the door leading to a subterranean corridor that was one of the shortest routes to Dodd 's offices . In everything we saw , we imagined danger . As we started for the door . Marjorie spotted the duty officer at the garage police desk reaching for the phone . A moment later we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the entire corridor we were to traverse . We simulated carefree conversation , though we felt questioning eyes burning into our hacks . But in three minutes we had climbed the marble staircase and were again inside Dodd 's suite . This time we were a little cooler . more methodical . Like archaeologists grubbing for fragments of old bones , scrap by scrap we uncovered items that were full of meaning : copies of letters from Dodd to the President recommending high appointments for a group hardly distinguishable from the senator 's major contributors ; a report to Dodd from one of his cronies . recounting how firms that had received constituent services from Dodd 's office were being solicited for contributions to the 1961 testimonial . the proceeds of which we knew had gone into Dodd 's pocket ; a file that traced Dodd 's requests to certain Hartford insurance companies to grant large business loans to a real-estate speculator with the musical name of Manlio Liccione. a service for which Dodd received thousands of dollars in finder 's fees ; a curt letter to Dodd from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlist White House muscle in behalf of a contract for Avco 's Lycoming Division . " Listen ! " Marjorie warned . Again we heard footsteps in the hall outside . This time they stopped right in front of us . Someone tried the door , then knocked vigorously . Marjorie attempted to hide behind the file cabinets . I dragged her out . " You must sit behind your old desk . " I whispered urgently . " If he tries to force the doors , and Dodd 's starts to give . I 'll let him in and ask what he wants . You start typing and look natural . " Our visitor was now knocking on Dodd 's door . I went to it and listened . He moved on . Each doorknob was tried . each door knocked on . Then he left . Frantically we gathered up our contraband and prepared to leave . But the more we reconstructed the event , the surer we became that it had been just a routine door check . " Cops ale always trying doors . " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he could n't know the doors are locked from the inside , and that someone is in here . " We decided to stay , and in the next hour . which we vowed would be our last , we unearthed records of Dodd 's activities involving a number of corporations that had for months figured prominently in our speculations . Racing through these files . I grasped the bare outlines of three particularly significant cases : Allegheny Airlines : As a senator . Dodd had helped Allegheny to obtain millions in subsidies . Later he had secretly purchased Allegheny stock under the name of a friend . Kaman Aircraft : Dodd had lobbied effectively for Kaman with defense agencies and even with a private corporation having subcontracts to let . In gratitude Pres. Charles Kaman. a Republican who had never made a contribution to Dodd in four previous campaigns , came to Washington personally in the late summer of 1964 to give the Connecticut senator a $4,000 check . The MITE Corp. : Dodd had asked the White House to exempt this electronics firm from competitive bidding on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of another . In September . 1964 . Pres. Robert Blinken of MITE made a Pilgrimage to Washington to brine a brown envelope containing $2.100 in cash , which Dodd never reported , either as personal income or as ixilitical contribution . There was much more in the file cabinets . we were sure , but we had stayed as long as we dared . At 9:50 we left Dotld 's suite and began what we had come to call the last mile . If I had been wrong about the - routine door check , " someone could be lying in wait for us . The desk at the end of the corridor was  --  strangely  --  unoccupied , and in the garage a police captain and a lieutenant stood talking with the officer on duty . We went to the car without looking left or right , our bulging valises now feeling like huge albatrosses . As I backed out of the parking space , a vehicle suddenly pulled up short in back of me , but it was only a laundry truck . and it moved to let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . they smiled and waved at us . And in a moment we were out in the bright Sunday-morning stillness of the street . Ahead lay a day of photocopying , and then the return of all originals to Dodd 's liles . When the senator 's office opened for business Nlonday moiling , all must be back in perfect order . Opal Cann was waiting , cool with conspiratorial aplomb. when I arrived at the K Street address Jack Anderson had given me . Our meeting place was a half-finished office suite . The air conditioning was off . The incomplete furnishings and d  --  cor gave no hint of what business normally was transacted in the office , but the essential item of equipment was there , dominating the office  --  a large photocopying machine . Around noon a man named Irving Davidson entered . He was an acquaintance of Jack 's , and this , it turned out . was his office . He looked around cheerfully for a few moments and then left . Irving Davidson  --  his name struck a note in my memory  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copied at least 3,000 documents . It was after seven when the last page of the last folder came down the chute. but it would still be daylight for almost two hours . If I hurried , I had time to return to Dodd 's office . Inside the coo/ depths of the Old Senate Office Building again , I stopped at a public phone and dialed Dodd 's office . No answer . I picked up my burdens , glanced over my shoulder to where a bored guard lolled at the entrance . and plodded forward . Cumulative tension now began to build up inside me . An hour earlier , I had returned a toad and had found lights in the office on again . though I had turned them off that morning . Someone was just barely missing me . Concern over the unknown visitor , over Irving Davidson , over the law of averages itself , dogged my weary steps . In 20 disciplined minutes I returned each file to its appointed drawer , in its alphabetical place , recalling with perverse satisfaction that in all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never been able to fathom the filing system , and now I had mastered it . Once more down the hall . a smile at the desk to a man who could not distinguish me from the thousands who passed by him each week , and out through the revolving door into the street . As I hit the evening air , an excruciating sense of conquest came over me . The originals had all been returned , the copies were all secure in Jack Anderson 's safe . Whatever else might happen , inexorable consequences would flow from this . I was suddenly very , very tired . For a long while I sat motionless in the car , enjoying the stillness and the sight of couples strolling in the park across the street . We later obtained a cache of confidential records that helped us trace the collapse of several Dodd investigations to persons and interests that had later turned up on various contributions lists . Terry Goklen procured copies of valuable documents and mailed them to Marjorie from Dodd 's office . Michael now became the key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copies of his employer 's records , but the financial accounts to which he alone had access were needed to lie down some of our most important leads . Michael had continued to help us in various ways and seemed more and more to share our view about the documents . One September night he agreed to come with us to Jack Anderson 's house . Jack made a persuasive appeal , saying that we had put together a case against Dodd that would shock the nation and force reforms , and that Michael 's help was essential to put it over the top . " I know you are trying to do the right thing , Mike . or you would not be here tonight . I know you are hesitating to take the last step only out of a sense of duty to your employer . I have lived with this problem for twenty years and , believe me , your ultimate duty is to the public and to the democratic system , not to a crook like Dodd who has betrayed his office and every honest person associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterward he agreed to give us the financial records after he had brought them up to date . It was now just a matter of timing . But time was to prove short . In October Terry Golden was fired , without explanation . Shortly before that . Judy Berling had been forced to resign . Their meetings with Marjorie had been discovered , and a purge was on . Terry 's firing came without warning on a Friday afternoon , as Dodd was leaving town . Like Marjorie and me , she was forbidden to return to the office . We judged that Michael might be next , on Monday . and our last chance to get the financial records would vanish . He saw the urgency and made his decision . Spending all day Saturday in the office , he brought the books up to date and then took them to Marjorie 's office for photocopying . We had now acquired from all sources about 7,000 pages of documents , more than enough to start several official probes . Except for a stray find by Michael , who remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And none too soon . For , somehow . word of our activities had apparently reached Dodd . The senator immediately reactivated his security apparatus . The locks were changed . The building superintendent and the police were summoned to emergency conferences and instructed to put Dodd 's office under strict watch , And Dodd told Michael that private detectives were at work and would expose the " plot " in a matter of days . Through the late summer and fall of 1965 , Marjorie , Terry . Michael and I held regular " document sessions " at Jack Anderson 's house in Bethesda , Md . Each night Jack began methodically by distributing colored pencils and stacks of documents , and for hours we would plod away . classifying each paper , and appending notes about its significance . Later in the evening , using my original memos as a base . Jack would lead us step-by-step over a particular incident , gathering together the relevant documents , while he furiously took notes in shorthand . The smallest details were important . If a phone call was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ log and in the telephone bills , which listed all long-distance calls . It was a slow , tedious grind . but there was an undeniable fascination to it arid . as the project increasingly dominated our lives . we came to look forward to these meetings . In November . 1965 , we finally obtained a copy of Dodd 's official report of campaign contributions and expenditures for the 1964 election . To get it . Jack Anderson had sent an associate . Robert Bird , to the state Capitol in Hartford , accompanied by his wife . Bird was told at the secretary of state 's office that there were no copies , nor was he allowed to have Dodd 's report photocopied , though it was supposed to be a public document . So Bird and his wife spent two days in the secretary of state 's outer office , copying the original report by hand . It contained the names and alleged amounts received from hundreds of contributors , as well as itemized expenditures ranging from $3.50 for the rental of a TV set up to $110,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was worth the effort . W e quickly established that not a penny of the $56,000 raised at the testimonial dinner in November , 1961 , or the $13,000 in September , 1963 , or the $42,000 in October , 1963 , was listed in the report . We did not have accurate records against which to measure all Dodd 's official entries , having failed in our effort to obtain them from Ed Sullivan a year before . But circumstance had fixed in our memory several large donations , and we checked .. in .. he would called again to sayll t I go straight home , And I hat he wanted lo talk to a loll , a acid , Jim m , as soon Markha got there . " Tell .1 Markham it 's an emergency , " lie said . Thal ' , , noon Drew Pearson asked i he 11111 , I he Washington Post why they li . I.11 his column that morning . Ile , . , ' lied the scope of I Ile I iodd project , said that he regarded it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience , and vowed that he could personally , vouch for the massive documentation on which it was based . In the end the Post agreed to print the columns , and the Dodd revelations thus reached official Washington , our most important single audience , W ith publication under way , we promptly undertook Phase Two of our plan  --  the briefing of key officials . Marjorie and I felt that the President himself should be informed , for Dodd would be sure to importune the White House to intervene in his behalf . Unless the President knew something of the extent and validity of the charges , we reasoned , he might try to help Dodd , and thus implicate himself and the Democratic Party . Marjorie 's boss , Berl Bernhard , executive director of the Lawyers ' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law , was an intimate of the White House staff . so we asked him to he the bearer of the bad news . Marjorie told Bernhard the major aspects of the Dodd story and the source of the information in the hands of Pearson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her involvement , and he avoided asking her . At 8:30 on the morning of January 26 , Bernhard called at the White House . Thirty minutes later the President was briefed by an aide . In contrast to those who would later scoff at the case against Dodd . Johnson immediately perceived it as an explosive matter . He asked for more information , firing incisive questions , some of which had to be referred to Marjorie and me lor answers : Will this cause us to lose any Administration legislation ? Does the expose involve Government contracts , bribery , tax violations ? Are there inside informants , confidential records , extensive material ? He asked , too . if his appearances at Dodd 's fund-raising affairs could be used as a pretext for dragging his name into the scandal  --  and we passed back the word that a presidential aide had made the proper inquiries on Johnson 's behalf about the purpose of the fund-raising and had been assured that the money was to be used for campaign purposes . The President 's questions were all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent thanks to Bernhard for informing him , ( Later we heard through White House reporters that , from the time of our warning , the presidential door was closed to Tom Dodd . ) At about the same time , Jack Anderson went to see the Senate Majority Leader , Mike Mansfield . Jack said he would soon begin pressing publicly for a Senate investigation , and cautioned that it would be a calamity if there were a repetition of the failure that had marked the Rules Commit tee 's probe of Bobby Baker . Mansfield replied that if the facts were as Anderson stated them to be , he would use what influence he had to see to it that the Senate met its responsibilities . But , he added . " It 's up to you to create the climate for action . " Next . Jack called J. Edgar flotneeel deputy , Cartha ( Deke ) DeLoach , and told him that he had information Oh criminal misconduct by Dodd , that he was requesting an FBI investigation , and that he had thousands of &a-1; ments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DeLoach ex. plained that , as we knew , the FBI could not investigate a United Staten senator without explicit direction from the Attorney General . In the meantime , Drew Pearson de . mantled an investigation by the Senate Ethics Committee , on his weekly radio broadcast , carried by more than 100 stations . A day or two later committee chairman John Stennis of Mississippi was quoted in the press as saying that there were no charges properly before the committee on which it could act , whereupon Anderson sent him a formal request for an investigation , specifying charges and offering to furnish full documentation as well as a list of witnesses who would willingly testify . Stennis did not respond . Now Dodd was in the gravest dilemma of his life . In the beginning he was necessarily ignorant of how much Anderson knew . He could hope that the barrage involved only the Klein relationship . a relatively minor facet of the story , and would soon end . From all over , Dodd received letters from critics who denounced him and Aron , supporters who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could he do ? A public defense on the floor of the Senate ? A press conference ? These were luxuries reserved for those who dared to submit to questioning . But to take Pearson 's attack lying down , day after day . was an ordeal for which Dodd was poorly constructed . And . after a heartening show of support from Connecticut politicians at the annual Jefferson-Jackson dinner , on February 26. he launched a major counterattack . My first news of the Dodd offensive came in the form of a telephone call one afternoon in early March . " Hello , this is Sarah McClendon. " said a pleasant voice . I immediately recognized the Texas twang of the lady reporter whose provocative questions had enlivened so many of President Kennedy 's press conferences . " Are you the James Boyd who was discovered by Senator Dodd on his office divan with a young secretary . in a highly compromising position ? " six asked . " And did you . . . " " Whoa ! " I interrupted . " Give me : chance to catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ' no .

He visited Marjorie 's former husband , Eric Carpenter , now remarried and living in New York , and probed vainly for discrediting information about her . Similar inquiries were made about the others .

" said Stewart . as Lynch read off our names . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lynch blurted , fresh out of subtle approaches . Lynch was n't the only one asking questions . On March 28 and 29 , 1966 , separate teams of FBI agents called on Marjorie , Michael , Terry and me . At long last , I thoughrwe could give them the information we had been preparing for a year , which Jack Anderson had offered in our behalf . But the agents had been instructed not to take any information concerning Dodd . We are interested only in what you can tell us about the removal of documents from Senator . Dodd 's office , " said a man who identified himself as " Agent Chisolm . " The Department of Justice had thus adopted a curious order of priorities . Our action in removing proof of misconduct from a public office not only lacked a criminal motive , but on its face was designed to expose illegal acts . In fact . an analysis prepared by the legal department of the Library of Congress later concluded that our actions lacked various elements , including criminal intent , necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers whom talked to went further and defended our action on the positive ground that it was praiseworthy to expose unlawful acts which otherwise would have gone undetected . In contrast Dodd stood publicly charged with a variety of major federal offenses. including conflict of interest and large-scale income-tax violations . To back up these charges . Jack Anderson had made available to the FBI thousands of documents . Yet it was our improbable transgressions , not the conspicuous felonies , that were now being studied with all the resources of the world 's most celebrated law-enforcement agency . I told Mr. Chisolm that I would gladly testify , with no holds barred , before any grand jury , court proceeding , or congressional nittee convened for the purpose o ! ligating Senator Dodd , but that , a . , g as the authorities refused to investigate Dodd . I would not give them information that could be misused to create a sideshow . Marjorie , Michael and Terry took the same position .

As the middle of April approached , 12 weeks and 23 columns after publication of the liodd stt try had begun , our enterprise could only have been characterized as a failure . The help we had counted on- from the press , the authorities , the public --  had not materialized . And now the Pearson attack itself had ground to a halt . For three weeks Pearson had held up the expose columns on Dodd . Editors were protesting , he explained to Anderson . They were getting tired of the Dodd series and worried about libel action . A cold chill settled over our ranks . We had accepted the loss of our jobs , the turning away of old friends , the assault upon our motives , the public denunciation as thieves and liars , the dirty stories , the threats of criminal prosecution , the pursuit by private detectives , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were content to pay  --  if it served an end . But by the middle of April all the portents indicated that no end might be served at all , except it be the further entrenchment of Dodd and others like him , and he intimidation of those who would some day be in our shoes and would cite our sorry example as good reason for keeping silent about what they discovered . I remained stubbornly hopeful , but I felt more and more that I had led the group into meaningless sacrifices . Apparently we had underestimated Bat in Om III kat. .111 ( 1.1 ? , , m lo in .. .1d W4 ' heel tiutlyhl 14 ; , 11 ' informa1 ion I. pi , . ail r , s ; sw that ir was wit Jim elnetanti , hut massive iesistanee by ' I lir Senate , 11w Justice I ) eparllnenl , the Infernal Revenue Service and the Conocclicut authori-ties .

The immediate need was to get off the defensive and start our attack rolling again . First , we decided to see Drew Pearson , and Lry to persuade him to resume the Dodd columns . On a Saturday afternoon in April , 1966 , Jack Anderson drove Marjorie . Terry . Michael and me to Pearson 's weekend retreat in rural Maryland . When our host appeared . Jack opened the discussion by saying that we all felt the Dodd story was flagging , and then he turned the floor over to me . I began in disorganized fashion , expressing grateful recognition of Pearson 's great investment in effort , column space and risk in undertaking the Dodd story . Then I spoke haltingly of how we had made real headway until the last few weeks , how Dodd had then taken over the initiative , and how we needed to regain it . " So you think I 've got cold feet , eh ? " Pearson said finally . " Well , I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've said . I 've been out around the country on a speaking tour . Everywhere I go , people ask me if anything will be done about Dodd . If we do n't get action , I 'm afraid the little people of this Country will become terribly disillusioned with their Government . and Him would be a very had thing . What do you have in mind ? " I suggested a resumption of the columns , pointing out . that we had never completed the series about the Senator 's diversion of campaign funds . " All right . " he said . " But I think se art ? being repetitiotis and dull in some of I these columns . I do n't want to overwhelm my readers with masses of confusing facts and figures . I 'm looking for fresh stories , new subjects that have a moral to them , things that affect people . What do you have ? " Marjorie . Michael and Terry joined in now , suggesting unexploited topics . Pearson entered into the discussion with warmth and spirit . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folders , and sal down in the middle of our circle . " I have some material here on Dodd and the insurance companies . and the gun industry . " he said . I received the impression that it was important to him to make personal contributions . beyond editing and rewriting . Then it would be his story and not just the product of his organization . Pearson 's mention of needing new subjects brought me up sharp . I had often gone over my notes of eases that we had felt particularly revealing of Dodd 's misuse of office for personal gain ; I always hoped to find some new insight that would help us to-stimulate the interest of those who haul not yet been aroused by the Dodd story . There seemed to be a sort of jaded .1 acceptance of profiteering in office . It was not news . " So what if Dodd is getting a little on the side ? " asked one reporter . " A lot of them are . Who is he really hurting ? " But we had learned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . someone gets hurt . And , out of the many abuses we uncovered , we came to feel that the on which best illustrated this hurt were the investigations that Dodd had been persuaded to water down or abandon . One such investigation , launched amid fanfares of publicity . had beta aimed at the illegal traffic in dangerous fireworks , after numerous cases of deaths and maimings . The Juvenile Delinquency Subcommittee staff . headed by Carl Perian , had prepared cases against several of the larger producers of these explosive devices when three of the producers called on ) odd at his office . They complained that the projected hearings would put them out of business  --  later returning , they told Carl , to give the senator a contribution . One way or another they apparently were most persuasive , for Dodd called Perian , in their presence . " Carl , " he said . " I want you to stop harassing honest businessmen for stretching the law a little . I want you to drop this investigation and get off their backs . And stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to them a shred of the information you 've gathered . Understand ? " Carl understood . But in the fireworks investigation , we had only the offending producers ' +semis ; ( tape recorded C that money changed hands . We had succeeded in piecing together much more complete pictures of the senator 's investigations of the insurance industry , and of televs. programming , with its heavy erne/1.s on sex and violence . And the .. piet partly because they were more cletra ' revealed Dodd 's misuse of office more shockingly .
