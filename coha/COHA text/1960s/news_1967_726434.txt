txt Sen. Abraham A. Ribicoff , a year of hearings on urban problems behind him , expects to continue being a burr under the saddle of the executive branch of government . In an interview on the final day of nearings by the Ribicoff subcommittee on executive reorganization , . the Democratic junior Senator from Connecticut said : ? Large American cities are definitely being short-changed in the amount of federal assistance they are getting . ? The administration 's model-cities program is the correct " vehicle " for solving ghetto problems , but the concept of having cities compete for funds is basically unfair and should be changed . ? He expects to introduce a bill soon providing for the establishment of a commission to study the organization and management of the executive branch of the government , and to recommend changes to improve governmental efficiency and economy . The Ribicoff subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Government Operations started hearings last August on the federal role in urban affairs . In the 33 days of hearings held since then , a number of head Please turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked by Ribicoff // lines were created as Senators Ribicoff , Robert F. Kennedy , and others questioned witnesses including Cabinet members , mayors , bankers , civil-rights leaders , and ghetto residents . New York Mayor John V. Lindsay said his city alone would require $50 billion of new federal money on the next decade . Banker David Rockefeller said that $5 of private investment in urban rehabilitation would be involved for every governmental dollar . Education cited Senator Ribicoff produced an estimate of experts that it would require $1 trillion total public and private investment to provide for rehabilitation of American cities in the next 12 years . And a Los Angeles Negro au , or from Watts made the outstanding literary contribution of the hearings by saying : " The ghetto is not the houses . It is the people . " Sitting in his office a short time after he had adjourned the final committee session , Senator Ribicoff was unperturbed that his hearings had wound up with a whisper instead of a bang . All of the other senators on the subcommittee had been otherwise occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had served their purpose , he said , that of comprising a task force in public to eduCate Congress and the nation to the scope and depth of the problems of the cities . New ideas for coping with urban problems had been introduced . " There is no sense in being repetitive and boring , " he said . " It is now up to the substantive committees of Congress to go into some of these problems more deeply , And while I consider this ' set of hearings closed , they are not necessarily finished . If something provocative comes up , we will hold more hearings . ' ' What next for the Senator ? Well , he does have 20 pieces of his own urban legislation to push in Congress  --  most of which developed from issues brought out in the hearings . Commission urged And he just happens to have a bill ready to go into the hopper which would establish a blue-ribbon presidential commission on the reorganization and management of the executive branch . The proposed commission would assess the present and future goals of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure of the executive branch and the coordination within the agencies and departments ; and appraise administrative management of the executive branch . Hearings will be held this summer on the proposal . He sees the commission as assisting the President , not interfering with his prerogatives . The only witness of the final hearing , Charles L. Schultz , Director of the Budget Bureau , had tried to answer a previous Ribicoff criticism that the Bureau of the Budget was bungling the coordination of federal programs . He was asked : Was he satisfied with Mr. Schultz 's report on progress in executive coordination ? " The big problem now is to make bureaucracy work , " Senator Ribicoff replied . " The Budget Bureau is far from doing a really effective job of coordination . " Proportions hit Mr. Schultze had testified that federal aid payments in urban areas would total $10.3 billion . in fiscal 1968 . Was the senator satisfied that this was enough ? " I think the cities are being definitely short-changed , " Senator Ribicoff said . " When you deduct general education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $6 billion . If you look at the total budget and the total gross national Product , that is not nearly enough , considering that most of the people live in the cities . " He realizes that with the Vietnam war go- ing on , there are not unlimited funds avail ? able for cities . But the share of the budget pie is disproportionate to the billions in federal funds for agriculture , health , water , and sewer and other assistance going to rural areas and small towns . He is also critical of the administration for the emphasis in the modelicities program of having a competition in which a large number of cities will be left out . Rather than give the 1968-69 authorization of $900 million to just the winners of , the competition , he wants to spread the money out during the next three years to all cities that can qualify . " The time has passed for demonstrations , " he said . " All of the model-cities funds in the next few years should be spent preparing for and planning for the 1970 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have enough funds to help all urban areas eliminate ghettos in an orderly , intelligent fashion .
