THE HISTORIAN AND HISTORY by Page Smith . 261 pages . Knopf. $4.95 . <P> Though they have been writing history for several centuries , historians are still arguing about how it should be written . Some would like to inject more economics into history , some more sociology , others more psychology . Some would place more emphasis on free will , others on impersonal forces . Page Smith , biographer of John Adams , would settle for a little more imagination . <P> In a witty , incisive , appetizingly readable book , Smith tries to show where modern history has gone astray . Mesmerized by all the new sciences of the time , 19th century historians decided that history , too , could be a science . Eloquent layman historians like Gibbon , Burke and Hume went out of fashion . Academicians took over the writing of history , and they have had a hammerlock on it ever since . With enough research and " objectivity , " they were sure that history could be reduced to a number of immutable laws , that human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up trying to see the big picture and began grinding out monographs to which Gibbon would have allotted a footnote . <P> Botching the Revolution . Nowhere is this kind of history produced in greater or grimmer volume than the present-day U.S. , where a not-too-untypical Ph.D . candidate will write on " The Dairy Industry in Wisconsin Between 1875 and 1885 . " ( " He must have covered the subject teat by teat , " groaned a professor . ) Though there are now an average 15 Ph.D.s laboring over each year of American history , historical interpretations have not noticeably improved . Pseudoscientific systems are no substitute for imagination . A case in point , writes Smith , is the American Revolution . <P> As Smith sees it , the best history of the Revolution was written by a participant , David Ramsay , in the decade after the war . Ramsay concluded that the chief cause of the Revolution was implicit in the Stamp Act : the British Parliament wanted more power over the colonies than the colonies were willing to allow . But later historians were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war into a moral crusade for freedom and made poor old bumbling George III a sinister villain . Arthur Schlesinger Sr. saw the war as a class struggle in which colonial merchants were pitted against colonial proletariat . Then , in the 1950s , Edmund and Helen Morgan astonished the historical community by declaring that resistance to the Stamp Act was , after all , the cause of the war . Historical interpretation had come full circle . <P> Lives Relived . History can never be a matter of scientific exactitude , argues Smith , and historians who take pride in their objectivity on the ground that they are writing at a time remote from the event are merely imposing their own system on the past . " Individuals in history achieve authenticity through their actions , " writes Smith , " and historians can not arbitrarily deprive these lives of their meaning by judgments imposed long after the event . That we should ever have accepted any convention which held the contrary is monstrous . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
