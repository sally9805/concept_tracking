With 48 games still to go , Los Angeles Dodgers General Manager Buzzie Bavasi last week passed the word that he would give Sandy Koufax a $30,000 raise next season , making him the first pitcher in history to earn $100,000 a year . " He 's worth it , " said Bavasi . " Sandy pulls an extra 5,000 people into the park every time he pitches . " <P> Bavasi must be afraid Koufax will ask for $120,000 next year . The attendance figures show an average of an extra 8,600 fans every time Koufax pitches . Smart fans . Last week Sandy became the first pitcher in either league this season to win 20 games-and he has only four losses . He beat the New York Mets again , striking out 14 men in nine innings . That plus another 12 strikeouts in shutting out Pittsburgh 1-0 for his 21st victory at week 's end brought his total K 's this year to 279 . With about twelve pitching turns to go , he seems a cinch to smash Bob Feller 's alltime ma jor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Koufax winning 30 games , which would make him the first pitcher to achieve that since Dizzy Dean won 30 for the St. Louis Cardinals in 1934 . " I would have to win almost every start the rest of the way and pick up some in relief , " says Koufax . With the Dodgers clinging to a thin lead and three teams in pursuit , Manager Walt Alston was thinking along exactly those lines .
