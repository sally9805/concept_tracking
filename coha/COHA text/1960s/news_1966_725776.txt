txt President Johnson has intervened actively to cool off the boisterous American boom . He has pushed down an entirely different set of brakes to supplement the monetary brakes ( credit and interest rates ) that were beginning to squeal and smoke . First response is favorable , outside of some business criticism . There is grumbling that Mr. Johnson did n't act sooner , and disagreement over some of the proposals , but it appears that business , Federal Reserve System , and Congress will go along . Second step taken Mr. Johnson 's manner was quiet and composed as he disclosed his program to a press conference . This was the tone also of his message to Congress . Obviously he sought to avoid the sense of crisis . He noted the extraordinary prosperity of the exuberant economy . Yet the fact that he acted when he did , only two months before an election , indicated that the matter could not be delayed . The boom started 51/2 years ago with active federal intervention to stimulate expansion . This incentive has been remarkably successful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps for cooling off the boom . The first deflationary step came last January with a mild series of tax increases and accelerated tax payments . According to his calculation this amounted to $10 billion withdrawn from the economy , though many economists consider this exaggerated . Now conies the second nudge of the brakes with a third still possible . Most conspicuously , he has asked Congress to suspend temporarily two tax subsidies going to business , originally intended to stimulate the economy in the early 1960 's . Suspension asked One of these was a 7 percent tax subsidy to business for money invested in new plant and equipment  --  the " capital investment tax credit . " It has worked so well that business is falling over itself to get new plant and equipment to meet a raging demand , and borrowing money for the purpose at an extremely high rate , thereby , it is argued , compounding inflation . Giving business the bonus for doing what it wants to do anyway , has been compared here to paying a child to eat candy . Nearly every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy over Mr. Johnson 's action . They felt he should have moved earlier , and used income-tax increases rather than imposts specifically affecting business . The second tax change is to suspend the subsidy of so-called " accelerated depreciation . " Here again business got a tax bonus for construction of commercial and industrial buildings . Mr. Johnson asks Congress to shelve ( not eliminate ) these immensely valuable economic incentives till Jan. 1 , 1968 , when he promises to take another look at them . Such suspension has a double advantage , economists argue . It will brake the boom now , and later , if recession appears its reinstitution will start the boom all over again . Mr. Johnson offers two other parts of his // * New brakes applied to American boom // " cooling " program . First is to cut federal expenditures . Second , to institute measures to loosen credit and loans . " I am taking strong measures to reduce lower priority federal expenditures , " he told Congress in a special message . He asked Congress to cut expenditures in eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his requests . Finally , Mr. Johnson urged the qua siindependent Federal Reserve Board , and large commercial banks , to cooperate " to lower interest rates and to ease the inequitable burden of tight money . " Weapon remains President Johnson has one big further weapon to cool the boom if he wants to use it ? direct tax increases , or wage-price controls . Again and again Mr. Johnson said that he would consider these later . He evidently sought to give the impression that he is in steady control and is not acting impetuously or spasmodically . " I shall not hesitate to take further steps , " he said significantly at one point . Background is that neither Mr. Johnson nor anybody else knows just yet what Congress will appropriate , nor what Vietnam will cost . Besides eight pending appropriation bills , the administraton will submit a supple . mental defense bill ( for Vietnam ) to Congress probably around Jan. 1 . Some estimates put this at $10 to $15 billion . Mr. Johnson will need to find out how much the government must spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With rather brutal frankness he told Congress that when it wrote " add-ons " to the remaining appropriation bills " each vote to increase the budget will likely require a vote to increase the revenue later . " Mr. Johnson 's message included his customary summary of how prosperous the nation is , though he admitted frankly the existence of inflation . While promising to cut expenditures , he pleaded not to " make the poor carry the burden of fighting inflation . " Mr. Johnson made his customary plea to business and labor to be moderate . He spoke in a quiet , reasonable voice . His message to Congress was similarly low-keyed . It was noted that he identified himself with dislike of high interest rates . Critics charge that the Federal Reserve System had no other recourse than to raise interest rates to check the boom , because the administration failed to take the fiscal steps ( tax increases and expenditure cuts ) needed to dampen inflation . Deftness seen The President appears to have handled the awkward political situation deftly . Forced by inflation to act , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down primarily on big business , banks , and corpora . tions , and so far spared the smaller taxpayer . He has identified himself with dislike of high interest rates . Doubtless Republicans will stress the irony of this , since it is as . sertedly administration half measures which pushed Federal Reserve discount rates up , in self defense . On the other hand , Mr. Johnson has imposed genuine restrictive measures , promised others , and emerged from the water , it appears , with the consensus still in his mouth .
