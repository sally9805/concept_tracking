When the land suddenly slides , most of the old familiar patterns are ob- literated-and Johnson 's triumph was achieved by smashing across regional , economic and ideological lines that had long held firm for the G.O.P. At the same time , he drew massive support from all of the traditional Democratic voting blocs and metropolitan machines to rack up huge pluralities in the big cities . <P> Only a massive defection of Republicans to Johnson-based generally on the fear that Goldwater was simply too unpredictable to be trusted with one of the highest positions of leadership in the free world-could account for John- son 's sweep of New England and the Midwest . <P> Town &; Country . The small Protestant towns of New England had long been strongholds of Yankee conservatism ; yet Johnson knocked them off consistently . Verona , Me. , ( pop . 435 ) went for Johnson 139 to 55-almost an exact reversal of its 1960 margin for Richard Nixon . Of Connecticut 's 169 towns , Johnson won all but eleven -a feat unmatched even by Roosevelt . While conservative on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international-minded-and Goldwater 's trigger-happy image hurt him there . So did his confused stance on social security , particularly since it was so publicly aired by Fellow Republican Nelson Rockefeller in the New Hampshire primary . <P> The widespread fear that Goldwater might slash farm price supports and down- grade the Rural Electrification Administration helped lead to his sorry showing in the rural Midwest . Johnson almost wiped out the big G.O.P. margins traditional in downstate Illinois . He carried some rural areas of Wisconsin by an unprecedented 60% . He took North Dakota 's Ward County- which had gone to Nixon in 1960-by a margin of 2 to 1 . At the same time , Johnson also knocked down the normal Republican margins in Midwest suburban areas , even carried Missouri 's suburban St. Louis County . In the Rocky Mountain states and the Far West , the Goldwater campaign reached its high point at the time of his nomination-and it went downhill thereafter . Somehow , Lyndon came off as more of a Westerner 's Westerner than Barry , and Goldwater emerged as the man who might upset defense-oriented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City Sweep . Johnson 's greatest triumphs , however , came in the nation 's large cities . He cracked even such Republican metropolitan areas as Indian- apolis and Columbus , where the G.O.P. suffered from lack of organization and apathy toward Goldwater . Yet despite the prediction of a huge Johnson victory , Democratic ward leaders proved far from complacent , turned out their labor and minority blocs in spectacular fashion to produce comfortable voting cushions . Johnson rolled up a record 400,000-vote margin in Philadel- phia , some 70,000 better than Jack Kennedy had done . He won New York City by a whopping 1,300,000 , Baltimore by 155,000 ( more than half of his hefty Maryland margin ) . He led by some 650,000 in Chicago , 350,000 in Detroit , 100,000 in Milwaukee , 300,000 in Los Angeles .
