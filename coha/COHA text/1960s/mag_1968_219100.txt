Suppose the Beatles had discovered soothing syrup instead of psychedelia ; where would their music stand today ? A possible answer comes from the Bee Gees , acclaimed by many people to be the first deserving heirs to the Beatles ' shaggy mantle . Last week the five tousled youngsters swept in and out of Anaheim , Calif. , for their first American appearances , taped a couple of guest shots on the Smothers Brothers and Laugh-In TV shows , and relaxed in a Beverly Hills hotel to count their money and think clean . <P> " I do n't think we want to go where the Beatles have gone , " says Barry Gibb , 21 , eldest of the brothers who form three-fifths of the group . " They 've ruined their minds . " " Kids growing up now would like someone to love and idolize , " echoes Maurice , 18 . Right , says his twin brother Robin . <P> Indeed , much of the Bee Gees ' style ( the name , coined by an Australian disk jockey , stands for Brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say-when love and idolatry dogged the Beatles ' every step . The songs are simple , the beat steady , the tune up on top for easy listening . The words , too , push back the calendar a few years : unabashed love epics spiced with just a pinch of social awareness . " Oh , how I tried , really and sincerely I tried , " quavers Robin in one song , as background strings swirl up in Pucciniesque supplication . <P> Born on the Isle of Man , the Gibb brothers formed a family combo almost as soon as they could walk . The family migrated from Britain to Australia in 1958 , where the brothers worked their way up the radio-TV talent-show circuit . By last February the brothers had made it to London , acquiring along the way Drummer Colin Petersen and Guitarist Vince Melouney , and a producer got them into recording studios and out into the world . <P> Today , two LPs later ( on the ATCO label ) the Bee Gees ' brand of straight-forward sentimentality is winning a surprising response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to investigate the rolling , stoned Beatles ' milieu . The older boys smoke cigarettes , try a little wine now and then , nothing more . With a bit of luck , it might become a trend .
