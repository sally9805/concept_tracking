Danger lurks in the most innocent-looking household plants and spices , according to the latest warnings by doctors . Items : <P> The 40-year-old housewife who appeared at the emergency room of University Hospitals in Cleveland could not swallow and could scarcely talk . Her tongue was swollen and intensely painful . Through these impediments she managed to tell the doctor that while tending her house plants that afternoon , she had bitten a piece of stalk from a handsome specimen with striped leaves , called Dieffenbachia . Her pain was so severe that the doctors had to give her a morphine-type drug . After a while she was able to take , though painfully , a little aluminum-magnesium hydroxide as an antidote to whatever poison she might have swallowed . Her face and blistered mouth remained painful for more than a week , and she had to be content with a liquid diet and baby foods . What makes this case important , say Drs . George Drach and Walter H. Maloney in the A.M.A. Journal , is that Dieffenbachia-it is also called dumb cane and mother-in-law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be accidentally poisoned by it . A child who chewed it would become seriously ill , and the effects might be fatal if he swallowed it . For dumbcane stalks contain calcium oxalate , which causes burns similar to those of caustic soda . <P> Dr. Robert B. Payne reports , in the New England Journal of Medicine , a sick story about nutmeg . Two students at the University of North Carolina heard from a beatnik friend that it would give them a jag like a combination of the effects of alcohol and LSD or mescaline . The two lads each took two tablespoonfuls , the powder equivalent of two grated nutmegs , in a glass of milk . Within five hours they had a leaden feeling in their feet and legs , and an airy , dreamlike sensation in their heads . Their hearts were beating in double time . They were as red as beets . Both were agitated and apprehensive . Dr. Payne gave the boys a laxative to get the undigested nutmeg out of their systems , but their feelings of unreality persisted for 48 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has taken nutmeg for kicks will become addicted , says Dr. Payne : these boys found the experience as frightening as it was unpleasant . <P> Teen-agers and young-adult beatniks have started an out-of-season run on seed stores , buying up morning-glory seeds . Far from representing an interest in gardening , this trend is part of a feverish search for kicks . The word has got around , said the Food and Drug Administration , that the seeds of some varieties of the morning glory contain drugs , chemically related to LSD-25 , that will induce other-worldly hallucinations . The two favorite varieties are called , of all things , " Heavenly Blue " and " Pearly Gates . "
