" AFTER only nine weeks of his first season , Rudolf Bing looked like the best thing that had happened to the Met in many a day , " wrote TIME in its first cover story on the opera 's manager in 1951 . He had at least convinced people , the story went on , " that the Met was not doomed to creak forever along ways established back in the gaslight era . " <P> Last week an older but no less energetic Rudolf Bing led the Met into a new era and a new house at New York 's Lincoln Center . Our second cover story on Bing not only brings his career up to date but assesses the present condition of an ever-appealing , grandly irrational art form-and reports the event itself in words and color pictures . <P> Covering the opening was for us the final act of many weeks of journalistic effort . In July , after a vacation in the Dolomites , when Mr. and Mrs. Bing embarked on the France at Le Havre for the trip home , Music Researcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in advance to some leisurely seaborne interviews since there would be little time once he plunged back into the swirl of work awaiting him at Lincoln Center . <P> <P> Immediately after boarding the ship , Virginia sent a bottle of Moselle to Bing 's cabin with a note saying that she was ready to begin at his convenience . Within 20 minutes , he called her to say : " Miss Page , I would have sung without the wine . " Bing himself set up the schedule : two hours in the morning , two more in the afternoon , and further talks at cocktails every evening . But after filling six large notebooks , she gave him-and herself-one day off . Virginia found him an " ideal " person to interview : " I believe he is the wittiest man I have ever met . " <P> <P> Back in New York , Virginia saw Bing ( and other officials and artists ) at the Met , and he made no secret of the interest he took in being a TIME cover subject . " Is it still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Senior Editor Jesse Birnbaum both had separate talks with Bing , took an exhaustive tour of the new house from the Top-of-the-Met restaurant to the basement practice rooms eight floors below , and saw rehearsals of the opening work , Samuel Barber 's Antony and Cleopatra . <P> <P> Like Bing , Cover Artist Henry Koerner was born in Vienna and spent his vacation in the Dolomites-in the same area at the same time . <P> But the two men did not meet until Paris , where Koerner painted his subject in seven hours of sittings over a period of three days . " A beautiful head , a very interesting head , " was Koerner 's dominant impression . Bing 's concern was with the eyes . " I have sad eyes , " he told Koerner , " but do n't make them look afraid . I 'm not afraid of anything . "
