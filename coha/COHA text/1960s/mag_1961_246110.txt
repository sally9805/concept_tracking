All over the city , even though it was early in the season , businessmen deserted the office to cluster anxiously around barroom TV sets . Radios blared baseball at pedestrians on downtown sidewalks . It was more than the sobersided Detroit Athletic Club could stand . " We are impelled , " announced the club 's News , " to caution the Tigers ' friends not to make too hasty an appraisal of their potential . " Few Detroiters listened . Their big-league ball club , moribund for the past 15 years , was suddenly the top team in baseball . Last week the Tigers split four games with the New York Yankees , swept three from the Baltimore Orioles , and moved five games in front of the American League . Pennant fever raged in Detroit . <P> While other American League teams were stumbling and grumbling about cold weather and weak benches , the Tigers were playing with convincing skill . The team batting average was a sparkling .280 , and four regulars were hitting over .300 . The pitching staff had a respectable earned-run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scheffing needed no more than eleven men a game ; the Tigers collected 42 hits and 29 runs in 27 innings . Afield , they made only one error to the Orioles ' four . <P> Skillful Trades . Secret of the Tigers ' startling rejuvenation is a series of skillfully planned trades , dating back to the beginning of the 1960 season , that brought First Baseman Norm Cash , Leftfielder Rocky Colavito , Centerfielder Billy Bruton , and Catcher Dick Brown to Detroit . Playing regularly for the first time this year , Cash is batting .333 , has five home runs and 29 RBIs . Temperamental , Bronx-born Rocky Colavito , who was appalled at being traded and suffered through a miserable 1960 season , is now happy with Detroit ( " I like the town , and then some " ) . Slugger Colavito , starting fast , already has nine home runs , 27 RBIs , and his own fan club of teen-age-girl bleacherites , who wear sweaters emblazoned ROCKY . With Colavito in left , Bruton in center and Veteran Al Kaline in right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Catcher Brown , another former benchwarmer , is hitting .303 . <P> Good Gamble . To round out his team , Manager Scheffing has gambled on Rookies Jake Wood , 23 , Steve Boros , 24 , and Phil Regan , 24 . All three bets have paid off . Regan , a fastballing righthander , has the lowest earned-run average among Tiger pitchers ( 2.12 ) , has won four games and lost none so far this season . Second Baseman Wood is a slick fielder and a long-ball hitter who resembles the Chicago Cubs ' Ernie Banks at the plate . Third <P> Baseman Steve Boros , a $25,000 bonus baby from the University of Michigan , leads the Tigers with a .339 batting average , is a strong candidate for Rookie of the Year . To balance his youngsters , Scheffing relies on a hard core of able , steady Tiger veterans : Outfielder Kaline , Shortstop Chico Fernandez , Pitchers Frank Lary and Don Mossi . For the first time in years , the Tigers have strength to spare . Reserve Outfielder Charley Maxwell hit 24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Osborne led the American Association in batting .
