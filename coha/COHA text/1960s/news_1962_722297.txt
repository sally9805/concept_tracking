The carryover , mostly in Federal bins . is the amount left from pievious crops when the harvest officially begins each Oct. 1 Domestic use this season is forecast at a record 3 8 billion bushels , about 6 ' , ; , mole than was harvested last fall . So the carryover will he about 200 million bushels below the two billion of a year before . The last drop , of 252 million bushels , was back in 1952 . The emergency feed grains program is the key factor . Under it , the Administration cut the 1961 crop to 3.6 billion bushels from the previous year 's 3.9 billion , and more than quadrupled surplus corn sales in the last 12 months . The sales hold down market prices , leading farness to expand corn-eating livestock herds : both hog and cattle numbers Jan wet e up from 1961 . Exports of 140 million bushels since Oct. 1 push 404 , ' , ahead of last year . STOCKPILE PROBES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department since 1950 has acquired more than $1 5 billion worth of war materials from abroad by swapping wheat , corn , tobacco and cotton . Most of the foreign items have been turned over to the strategic stockpile now under fire as wasteful by the President and Senate . The department will still barter for aluminum oxide , silicon carbide , antimony , asbestos . bauxite. chromite , copper , corundum , mercury and mica .

DAIRY PROPS help discourage U.S. output , of industrial casein. a milk product used in glue , paints , paper and fabrics . They make it more profitable just to turn out powdered milk , now piling up in Federal bins DOmestic output of the casein was 67 5 million pounds in 1937 , but by 1956 shrunk to 2 5 million and since has been too small , for Uncle Sam to count . Last year , the U S. imported about 90 million pounds of it from Argentina , Poland , Holland and others . ? TIN PRODUCERS mull efforts to press the U.S. into their price-pegging International Tin Council . These countries are jittery over Administration efforts to sell some of its 350,000 tons of tin from the controversial strategic stockpile , which equals about a two-year world supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the Congo , Malaya and other producers would breathe easier if they could gain a rein on U S disposal attempts through council membership . ? SAGGING SILVER prices menace the Administration 's aim to free the precious metal for broader trading . A bill that would remove the price floor and also the trade-blocking sales tax from the metal will go to Congress soon .

Sales of raw fiber abroad have been forecast at five million bales in the year ending July 31. down from the past year 's 6.6 million .

One reason : The U S export subsidy of 8,2 cents a pound wo n't quite fill the gap between the Government supported domestic price of about 33.5 cents a pound and the world price at Liverpool of about 24 5 cents . Odds are against raising the export subsidy now at a record high But rising textile imports build pressure to reduce 1963 domestic props so U S. spinners can buy cotton at prices nearer the world lesel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middling one-inch. they may average about 32 50 cents a pound , down from 33.04 for the 1962 crop .
