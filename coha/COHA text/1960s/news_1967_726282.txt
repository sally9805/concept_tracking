txt The sudden impact of the tornado which smashed through northern Illinois last week is fading slowly . Power has been restored , streets cleared of debris and many of the destroyed buildings removed ' and burned . But hundreds of devastated homes and scores of fatalities are evidence that almost nothing is really yet known about the nature of tornadoes . Meteorologists do n't know how tornadoes form or even where all the energy which produces those funnels of swirling 500 m.p.h. wind comes from . Without this knowledge , it is impossible to predict exactly where or when tornadoes touch down . The best the weather bureau can do is predict the possibility of a tornado over a general area with 80 percent accuracy , as Dr. Tetsuya Fujita , University of Chicago professor and tornado specialist , said . Thus all northern Illinois was notified as early as 1:30 p.m. last Friday that severe weather conditions existed which could produce tornadoes . A tornado watch was in effect . But no one knew where or when until a twister first touched down at 3:50 p.m. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tornado warning was issued , but for Belvidere it was too late . Despite the destructiveness of tornadoes , Dr. Fujita is one of only a handful of scientists studying tornadoes in this country . The reason , he explained , is the immense difficulty of tornado research . Taking accurate measurements of the speed of the winds in the funnel is at present impossible , because no equipment exists which can withstand such force . Similiarly , airplanes can not penetrate a tornado as they do the eye of a hurricane . " We are studying before and after a tornado but not the tornado itself " he says . It is also impossible to get equipment to a tornado before it dissipates . And again , unlike a hurricane , the probability of a tornado striking a testing station is prohibitively slim . " If we have the equipment and are in the // *Tornado spotlights warning problems // ' right place and do study the tornado , we can learn how to forecast it , " says Dr. Fujita . " But we have to know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Even if we had one billion dollars we would not just now know how to spend it . " Consequently , very few experiments on tornadoes are being conducted today . And all are on a small scale . - Dr. Fujita says five or six scientists are Simulating small tornadoes in laboratory experiments . " Another five or so are building mathematical equations of motion to see what kind of wind motion corresponds with real tornadoes . " Another 5. to 10 scientists are studying , like himself , the tornado itself , using radar and aircraft as best they can . " We know tornado pressure now . And we can estimate wind speed . But we do n't know where the wind is coming from . " More mobility suggested Almost all tornadoes are produced from intense thunderstorms . " What we do n't know , " he says , " is which severe thunderstorm in an area will produce a tornado and which will not . " Meanwhile , the Environmental Science Services Administration has been increasing its efforts to provide advanced warning on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City , Mo . Dr. Fujita says tornado-warning systems also must be refined at the local level , particularly in populous areas if casualties are to be prevented . During a tornado watch , he says , mobility is needed . After a tornado is sighted people have only one or two minutes at the most to run to a basement or find other protection . Thus he suggests individual warning systems should be set up in crowded schools , supermarkets , and other public buildings . For instance : A buzzer or siren in a school could be sounded by a tornado watcher stationed on the roof during a tornado watch . He says it is impossible to design buildings ? unless they are underground ? safe from tornadoes . Walls would look like bunkers . Thus 500 homes in Oak Lawn , Ill. , alone were destroyed or damaged Friday . But many casualties might have been pre- On patrol in Oak Lawn , Ill .

The weather bureau said this was the worst series of tornadoes in history in this area . But tornadoes seem more frequent because there are more developed areas . Ten years ago tornadoes hit open prairie land , which today are subdivisions , and went unnoticed . The expansion of urban areas stresses the importance of improving the tornado-warning system .
