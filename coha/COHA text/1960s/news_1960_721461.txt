txt A nation-wide audience listened last night to'the debate between Vice President Nixon and Senator John F. Kennedy ; on political philosophies . Most of the audience apparently made one of two basic de-. cisions : their vote prefer- , ences remained unchanged , ' or they were still'very much undecided . A sampling of opinions among those in the city and near-by areas who tuned in on the debate showed a wide range of reactions , hut perhaps the most typical of the responses was given by Patrick Lally , a main- , tenance man who lives at 112 Park Place and was questioned in a Brooklyn bar . " I do n't think these debates . will change anyone 's mind who has already decided on the candidates . It 's more for . people who have n't made up their mind .

But the end-of-summer hiatus in the Istudios , with many of the winter programs not . opening until next week , lessened the debate 's impact on the entertainment habits of most radio and television fans . One man in the same bar as Mr. Lally , Callahan 's Bar at 235 Flatbush Avenue , refused to give his name but declared emI phatically : " So far neither one of these ( guys has said anything .

' They were both very impressive and seemed to have firm convictions . But there were too many generalizations . It seems they were just being very nice to each other . " Other viewers were disappointed that the two candidates mostly restricted themselves to domestic issues . Later debates ' are scheduled to go into , // no relation to the Democratic candidate  --  said they did not watch the debate . " What show you talking about ? " asked Mrs. Kennedy when asked for a comment . " Oh , the television show . We did n't get around to it . We were out visiting " Many of the first , quick samplings showed that a considerable number of ? voters were apparently far from making any vote decision yet .

" " The program ? was very upsetting , " said Virginia Liehtner , of 331 West 19th Street . " Nixon seemed More interested in presenting a pleasant facade ; everytime he spoke he seemed to end it with a little smile , ' He seemed to say , ' Yes , I want more education , ' but he would n't say how he was going to get it . Kennedy seemed to have a quicker mind . " Dan Rosenbloom of 65-81 Parsons Boulevard , Flushing , Queens , said : " I think Mr. Nixon did a very good juggling act . He made it sound as if the Administration was doing everything the people want . Mr. Kennedy impressed me as someone who is just trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get through the Congress . Neither impressed me too much . " A partisan group of about 400 persons called by the Citizens for Kennedy , was gathered in the Delmonico Hotel at Park Avenue and Fifty-ninth Street to watch the debate . The audience of Democrats was restrained , but when some of them thought that Mr. Nixon looked uncomfortable or pressed by Senator Kennedy in the political exchange they would cheer or applaud . Even there , however , there was a general satisfaction that the debate was showing the voters both candidates in a faceto-face challenge . Mrs. Nona Dowd of 5410 Netherlands Avenue , Riverdale , called it a " wonderful program for both of them " and said that she thought they were both pretty close to each other on ideas . Alvin Hellerstein , an attorney at 61 Broadway , watched with the same group . He said he thought that Mr. Kennedy had given an appearance of great vigor and seriousness but that Mr. Nixon had seemed to be talking down to the people .

Bernard Newman , New York County Republican leader , said : " Mr. Nixon 's maturity and experience showed through clearly and unmistakeably , while Mr. Kennedy seemed to want to be all things to all men on all . issues . " To Nicholas Atlas , former Assistant United States AttorMost of- the group at the party felt that Senator Kennedy of only introduced most of toe concrete points of the program in his presentation but also accounted best in the give and take . " Kennedy looked less like Henry Aldrich , " said one of the guests , a Columbia University professor . " I resent the fact that Nixon has lost his jowls and Ken- ? nedy seems to have picked them up , " said a housewife , a member of the League of Women Voters . " I think Nixon showed up remarkably well in the question and answer period , " said one housewife .
