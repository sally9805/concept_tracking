" Unthinkable ! " one London newspaper called it when the rumor first popped up a month ago . But last week , only a few days before her third child was expected , Queen Elizabeth II announced her " will and pleasure " to the Privy Council that certain of her descendants , not in line for the throne , be permitted to bear the name of her husband 's house as well as of her own . By the intricate provisions of the royal declaration , Britain would not see a Mountbatten-Windsor for three generations , but that did not make the change of name any sweeter . <P> For many Britons , the almost instinctive hostility to the House of Mountbatten goes back to the anti-German feeling of World War I , when Wagner 's music was banned from the Albert Hall and to have a German name could mean getting the sack .

At last , after achieving , like his father before him , the rank of First Sea Lord , he became Britain 's first Chief of the Defense Staff in 1958 . <P> To right-wing types in England , he remains " the man who gave India away " under the direction of Attlee 's Socialist government .
