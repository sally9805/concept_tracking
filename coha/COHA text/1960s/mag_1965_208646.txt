For all the gold there is or ever was Beneath the moon could buy no mite of rest For any one of these exhausted souls . <P> Thus did Dante Alighieri stigmatize men of affluence , looking at commerce from his rather remote and medieval vantage point . Dante dominates and illuminates this week 's BOOKS section in a story that marks the 700th anniversary of his birth and is justly titled A Man for the Ages . <P> Today , gold and its equivalents are viewed somewhat differently , and the souls that strive for them are not necessarily exhausted . Quite a number of the stories in this issue deal in one way or another with getting and spending . The U.S. and WORLD BUSINESS sections , of course , are most immediately concerned , notably in our accounts of the stock market gyrations ( One for the Bulls ) , and of a small nation paradoxically in a jam because of its natural wealth and high per-capita income ( Trouble in the Garden ) .

See U.S. BUSINESS , How to Become a Millionaire ( It Still Happens All the Time ) . <P> ESSAY probes a paradox of U.S. affluence-it seems almost necessary to be a millionaire to afford servants these days , but some people are trying todo something about it .

The editors of these publications have worked hard in recent years to make their magazines better looking and better reading . Early this year the American Alumni Council , feeling that their efforts should be recognized , asked TIME to appoint a board of judges to look over the magazines and pick the publication that showed the greatest improvement over the previous year . As it happens , every year for the past twelve we have made another award-to the college or university that has done the best job of keeping in touch with its graduates by mail . <P> Our judges completed their review in due course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swett , manager of the Time Inc . Education Department , presented the awards . The winners : Cooper Union ( in New York City ) for the most improved alumni magazine and Lakeland College ( in Sheboygan , Wis. ) for the most impressive mail campaign .
