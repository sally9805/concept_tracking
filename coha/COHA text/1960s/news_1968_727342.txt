" This great newspaper , " Long said , " certainly does not want . to elect any Democrat as President of the United States , but its reporters are not leftwing-oriented . They tend to be conservative and express the views of those who believe in law and order . " He Notes warning Long said Daley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the activities of demonstrators , whom he described as communist-oriented " weirdos , screwballs , nuts , and cranks " intent on creating trouble and disrupting the Democratic convention .
