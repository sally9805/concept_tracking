At New York 's Rockland State Hospital , Dr. Robert Soblen was looked upon as a crack psychiatrist , even if a crusty one . He took a fatherly interest in the 100 mentally distressed adolescent boys in his care , saw to it that they had weekly jukebox parties , inspired them to learn trades , helped many of them to rehabilitate themselves . Respecting his professional skill , other doctors overlooked his personal quirks : a nervous temper , a streak of arrogance . Many knew but few cared that Robert Soblen was the brother and image of confessed Communist Spy Jack Soble , sentenced in 1957 to seven years in prison . But the Federal Bureau of Investigation did care . <P> For years the FBI tailed Dr. Soblen . He was aware of the chase and seemed to delight in it , on occasion slowing down his car so that the FBI car could catch up with him . Last week he displayed no surprise when FBI agents arrested him on a charge of wartime espionage , which could carry a death sentence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleaded not guilty , was jailed in lieu of $75,000 bail . Coolly he asked the judge for permission to bid farewell to " the FBI gentlemen-they were nice enough . " Then he bowed from the waist and waved to the agents . Said he : " Thank you very much , gentlemen . " <P> According to the U.S. charges , as far back as 1940 , Lithuanian-born Robert Soblen and his brother Jack made a bargain with Soviet Secret Police Chief Lavrenty Beria . The deal : both men agreed to come to the U.S. and set up separate spy rings , and Beria in exchange permitted their families-some 15 persons in all-to emigrate with them . Dr. Soblen , the Government charges , procured secret documents of the World War II Office of Strategic Services , information about an " atomic-bomb project on the Northwest Coast , " photographs of the Sandia nuclear-weapons development center at Albuquerque-and arranged to deliver it all to the Soviets . Along the way , Soblen made contact with Hollywood Producer and U.S. Counterspy Boris Morros , who presumably contributed evidence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brother Jack , who got off with a relatively light sentence for having talked long and loud ) . <P> Why had the FBI taken so long to nail Soblen ? The FBI as usual had no comment . But presumably it wanted to gather more evidence , and had hoped to bag some co-conspirators along the way .
