From the outset , the war between Nigeria and secessionist Biafra loomed as an unequal contest . It was not surprising that , as in the earlier Congo conflicts , foreign mercenaries were drawn to Biafra to practice their trade : fighting . Nor was it surprising that the beleaguered Biafrans accepted their services-despite the fact that mercenaries can be narrow , violent men who often harbor a deep contempt for Africans . In the midst of the idealism with which Biafra pleaded its cause for independence , the mercenaries have operated-sometimes ugly , certainly anomalous , but perhaps necessary to Biafra 's continued survival . <P> In 16 months of often brutal fighting , Nigerian federal troops have whittled Biafra down to one-tenth of its original area . They are now closing in on Umuahia , the secessionist state 's last major town and the current seat of Lieut . Colonel Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu 's movable government . Umuahia would have long since fallen had it not been for the exploits of the best unit in Ojukwu 's small army , Biafra 's Fourth Commando Brigade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first three months of the year operating behind Nigerian lines . Later , it held sectors on the Western front but , outgunned and outmanned by the federals , was forced to retreat . By early September , after a doomed attempt to defend Aba with supplies equal to only a daily average of five rounds of ammunition per man , the Fourth was down to barely 1,000 effectives . Of the 7,000-odd men with whom it had started the campaign , more than 300 had been killed and 2,200 had been wounded . The rest were missing in action . <P> Record Supplies . Last week the Fourth Commandos were once more rebuilding under the command of a German-born ex-Foreign Legion sergeant who became a sector commander for the S.A.O . ( Secret Army Organization ) in Algeria and then a colonel for Ojukwu in Biafra . He is Rolf Steiner , and he considers the war to be far from lost , contemptuously dismissing the territorial gains of the heavily armed Nigerians . " If any corporal serving under me in the Legion had taken more than a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he snorts , " I 'd have him shot for dereliction of duty . " Ojukwu , for whom Steiner has immense admiration , has authorized the Fourth to be expanded to two brigades , or 20 strike forces of 360 men each . The new men are being armed with weapons apparently bought with private European credits and flowing into Biafra from neighboring Gabon and the Portuguese island of Sao Tom . Up to as much as 40 tons are said to be arriving every night-more than ever before in the war .
