Agha Mohammad Yahya Khan , the 52-year-old army commander to whom President Mohammad Ayub Khan handed over power last night , assured the nation in his first radio address : " I have no ambition other than to create conditions conducive to the establishment of a constitutional government . " There were no public protests anywhere in Pakistan against the take-over , which canceled the promise of a return to parliamentary democracy next year after 10 years of President Ayub 's autocratic rule . Nowhere did the regime seek to make a strong show of force . Diplomatic analysts here saw no indication at this stage of a shift in Pakistan 's foreign policy as a result of the military takeover .

East Appears Resigned East Pakistanis , whose movement for provincial autonomy was thwarted by the takeover , appeared to resign themselves to the new order . But in private there were many who said it had destroyed the last chance to prevent an eventual parting of the ways between the two parts of Pakistan , which are divided by language and culture and by almost a thousand miles of Indian territory . The 73,000,000 Bengalis Of East Pakistan , the smaller of the two areas , account for more than half of the J28,000 , - 000 population .

" My hands are tied , " he said . " They may come for me at any time . " ? *As reporters turned to leave , he called out from his porch . " ' My people are with me , no one can suppress me . " Karachi apparently welcomed the takeover , if only because it promised a spell of calm after months of turmoil . The political expectations of many people here appeared to have been satisfied a month ago by President Ayub 's an ' nouncement that he would quit when his term ended . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of harsh decrees outlawing strikes , agitation and criticism of any of the government 's actions . The measures did not ban political parties . .

General Explains Step The army commander , who becomes the new head of state under the title of Chief Martial Law Adniinistrator , said the " extreme step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country from " utter destruction . " Speaking slowly in English with a marked English accent , the general was stern and solemn as he recounted the conditions of lawlessness and economic deterioration that - he said had forced the army 's decision . " The nation has to be pulled back to safety , " he said . The situation described by General Yahya arose in parts of East Pakistan following President Ayub 's promise on Feb. 21 to make way for a democratic government . The rioting claimed more than 250 lives . General Yahya did not mention East Pakistan specifically in connection with the violence nor did he offer any estimate of how widespread it had become . He said only that the military had concluded that the situation was deteriorating and beyond the control of the civil authorities . General Yahya assured students , workers and peasants that he was sympathetically aware of their needs , even though he found it necessary to curtail their right to protest in the interest of order .
