I figured I could make it up tomorrow if the weather held good , because Ip101really did n't think there 'd be much chance of trouble about schooling for several days . The girl had worked hard , and needed a rest . We got to Vicksburg on a Sunday , and Uncle Jim went into the city to inquire where the Farrows lived . We waited for him on the houseboat , which we tied up to the stern of a ferry that was out of business .

I noticed Uncle Jim looking on , before he left , and afterward he got Dr. Snodgrass to promise , with his hand on a Bible , that he would refrain from starting a clinic here , and maybe getting put in jail , or shot . " This is Vicksburg , not Bosky Dell , and they probably have such operations as yours regulated , " he told him . " Undeniably , it represents a challenge , " said Dr. Snodgrass , meditating , " but let it go . I 'll get them next trip . Have you noticedan excess of catarrhal , or tubercular , coughing , followed by hocking and spitting ? " " I was n't listening .

They even had the effrontery to confiscate two cases of the Men 's Kickapoo Gooser and feed it , publicly , to pigs . It is my sworn purpose to show them the error of their ways . " " But not at this particular time , " said Uncle Jim , and left . He was gone about an hour ; then he came back and said that the Farrows ' place , known as Belle Mead , was nearly five milesp102back-country , on what was known as Plantation Creek , a broad sheet , partly a back-water slough , that flowed down to the Mississippi . He 'd hired a buggy , from a private citizen ( because there were n't many public livery stables or hotels in most big Southern cities around the war years , on account of the hospitality , you know ) and was driving it himself . It was pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have said had a ewe neck and cat hams , but we piled in , with Zeb and the luggage on a box in the rear , and rattled out of town . It was a nice day , not too hot for a change , and the birds were twittering all along the way . This buggy had a top that was held up by four flimsy supports , so that it was open all around , and I must say that the ride was enjoyable , though we hit a rut , or a clod , or the horse stumbled , once in a while , and shook up your insides , which kept a person from going to sleep . We got there by and by , after stopping twice to ask , both times of bone-heads that had never heard of it , and one of them had n't heard of Vicksburg , then turned into a long shadowed driveway bordered by live oaks with beards of Spanish moss hanging down , gray and crinkled , and wound on up to the mansionhouse . This place made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a considerable distance in front , with square pillars , and a second-story porch the whole length , and by George if it was n't fresh painted ! White all over . A fan-shaped lawn spread out beforeit , and on one side a terraced garden ran down to the water 's edge , where I could see several small boats riding . Adjoining the house were the kitchen and what had been the quarters of the house slaves , and back behind the terraced garden were the barns , cotton storehouses , tobacco sheds , stables , and cattle pens . Still farther away were the plantation-slave quarters . Well , these people looked prosperous , but before we left we found out that they were unpopular in the Vicksburg society , and even ostrichized , as somebody said , because they 'd had money banked in England and never drew it out to help the Confederacy . They claimed an excuse but nobody swallowed it.  |p103Anyhow  , they had the means to grow cotton on a big scale now after the war , and they paid a fetching price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaves , which seemed peculiar to me . All of our people at Grassy stayed right where they were , except one , a man named Sulphur and Molasses , a feeble-headed fellow , but harmless , that had been talked to by the Freedmen 's Bureau , and said he preferred to go North and run for President . My Aunt Effie gave him the money to go , at a time when she could n't affordit  --  when none of the hands were taking a dime in wages  --  because she said she 'd prefer to see Sulphur and Molasses President to what they 'd got at the moment . That was several years ago , and he never had run ; I do n't know what happened . When our buggy arrived at the porch , a big servant man in a plum-colored suit strolled out and grabbed our horse 's head ( which did n't need grabbing as he was about caved in ) and then came up to Uncle Jim . " Yas , suh , gentlemen , " he said , pompous and grand as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announce you and your business . Marster require to know who 's visitin ' . "  |p104Uncle  Jim climbed down in a leisurely sort of way and stood gazing around for a space  --  he had a wonderful manner toward uppity servants ; it was enough to make their teeth grind  --  then he finally said , without looking at the darky : " Fetch a boy to take care of the rig , then trot in and tell your master that Captain Burnie , of Grassy Plantation , Kentucky , is being kept on his doorstep by an impertinent houseman . " In about thirty seconds , or less , a fair-haired fellow of Uncle Jim 's age , dressed with great elegance in a suit of brown linen duck , with a fancy nankeen waistcoat , came bursting out of the house and cried : " By God !  --  Burnie . " Then he added , when he saw Millie , " I beg pardon , Ma'am . " Well , he and Uncle Jim practically pumped each others ' arms off , and then this Farrow did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call handsome , I reckon , with a thin , straight nose , a tanned face , and a kind of excited expression , but I noticed that one of his eyes had a very slight cast to it . A person would n't spot it if you did n't catch him at a certain angle . " Now you 're here , Burnie , you wo n't get away soon . By George , we have got some catching up to do , and we 'll do it over the very best Madeira in the cellar . By the way , I mustered out first  --  what happened to old Grimes ? " " I shot him , " said Uncle Jim , lighting a cigar . Mr. Farrow was set back for a second ; then he broke into a merry laugh . " It 's possible , quite possible . It 's just the sort of thing you might do . " I found out later that a Colonel Grimes had been their commanding officer in the Mexican War , but nobody could stand him , and several came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would switch sides if things got worse . We soon learned that this Farrow household was cluttered up by a lot of people . I never could get them all separated in my mind , so I 'll just stick in the main ones , which were the old lady , Mr. Farrow 's mother , who dressed always in a black ma/terial that rustled when she moved , with white lace at her neck , but she stayed mostly in her room ; a beautiful girl with blond hair almost white that was his sister , named Lauriette ; a collection of bony , peckish aunts , and an older sister , as blackhairedas the other was pale . She was about forty , I figured . They were the ringleaders , but there were others , too , that flitted through these high-ceilinged rooms and picture-gallery corridors . I never managed to remember their names , confound the luck , but mostly addressed them as " Ma'am . " It came to me that Mr. Farrow , Uncle Jim 's friend , was the only man in the establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , I had n't been in that house three hours before I realizedsomething was wrong ; these people were worried . All of them were polite , though stiff , and exclaimed how glad they were to have us as guests , all but the younger sister , Lauriette . I did n't care for her manner , which was scratchy and sarcastic . It was the same way to everybody , mocky and over-gushing , and to tell the truth , I do n't think she liked a soul on earth . It was odd , because she was the handsomest person I ever saw , includingMillie , who had a clean and fresh and sturdy outdoor look , but managed to get a tomboy note into it , one way or another . Still , aside from the schooling , which was n't her fault entirely , I would n't have traded her for a dozen of these deep-south Lauriettes . For instance , they had an aunt there named Cora , a vinegary old possum that was forever complaining about her vertigo , which they said was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Laurietteand , " Why , darling Aunt Cora , how charming and well you look ! My land , you 're just the living picture of bouncing good health . Whatever have you been taking that 's worked this miraculouscure ? " You see what I mean ? After that blast , the old girl could n't any more have belly-ached about her vertigo than she could have swum up to Memphis towing a barge . She 'd had all the wind taken out of her sails before she had a chance to sound off.  |p106And  it was the same way this Lauriette treated them all . She pounced on everybody 's weakness , it seemed to me , and made it sound worse than it was . In mid-afternoon , with Uncle Jim and his friend swapping yarns in the library , Millie taking a nap , and Dr. Snodgrass giving a medical lecture on the porch to a fair-sized sprinkling of aunts , all sickly , the girl got me to walk her down to where the boats lay . " What 's your uncle 's name ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be bullyragged by a female , so I says : " Which one ? " Instead of getting vexed , she burst into a gay laugh and said , " Why , you dear , fun-loving little boy . You 're joking , are n't you ? " " I 've got nine or ten uncles up in Kentucky , " I said , working up a lie . " I thought you meant one of them . " " Now , why would you think that , you cunning child ? " " How 's that again ? You 'll have to excuse me , " I said , " but I 'm a little deef in my port ear . " She burst into another laugh , and said , " What kind of man is he , your Uncle Jim Burnie ? " So she knew his name after all . " Well . . . I think he 's better ; yes , I know he 's better , since he got out . He may be all right from now on . " " Got out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone I 'd heard her use . " Prison . They gave him three years off for good behavior . He strangled a smart-aleck yellow-haired girl just about your si  --  " I do n't know what happened , but she grabbed my elbow and spun me around , hard . " Little boy  --  what 's your name ? Davey ? Do n't say anything like that again unless you mean it . You did n't mean it , did you ? " " No , Ma'am , " I gulped . But she was already far away in a study , lost in some deep private reflection that had n't anything to do with me . We walked on down to the water 's edge , hung over dark with mossy limbs , and she told me I could use the boats , including one that she said was a centerboard skiff for sailing , entirely new to me ; then wep107climbed back up . By the time we arrived at the porch , her old style was back again , and she dismissed me with , " Run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you go back to quartersand visit your terribly picturesque old family retainer ? He may be lonely . " It seemed like a good idea , so I did it . Zeb was situated in a very clean , neat room in the old quarters for house slaves , with a family in the other part of the house . He took his meals with them . When I went in , he had his feet up on the wood hopper and was playing a mournful tune on his jew 's harp , of a sort that Uncle Jim said was an African 's lament over being in slavery . " Come in , honey , come in , " he sung out when he saw me . " Old Zeb feeling mighty low . " This was unusual , because as a rule he was as smiley and cocksure as a rooster . " I 'd just as soon move along , myself , " I said . " I do n't like it here . " " They 's trouble in this house , honey . Bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . We do good to git shet of here , come dark . " " It may be imagination . We 've been cooped up on a small boat and have n't seen any other kind of people . Uncle Jim knows what he 's about . " " Do he ? Mistuh Jim finish up de wah a cunnel , er gineral , if he had n't been so notional and back-sassy . " Well , that was true enough , I supposed . At least , it 's what everybody said , but I was n't aiming to let this know-it-all get by with anything , so I says : " If you 're so all-fired wise , what 's wrong about the Farrows ' house ? I expect you 've got it figured out by now . " He chuckled , entirely restored to his old braggy self . " Whoa , now . Pull ' at hoss back . I only taken it into cogitation on my juice harp . It 'll come , honey ; you jes ' wait . " As annoysome as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smelling out the truth , so I said , " That 's fine , but let 's pinp108it down farther . You must have some reason for saying the house is troublesome . Which of the people bother you ? " " Mighty nigh all on em , and that 's a fack . " " Look here , Zeb , I want you to do me a favor . Shinny around amongst the hands and see if they 've got a conjure man here . If there is something wrong , let 's dig it out . Ask him to boil some chicken bones or something . " " I do n't need no conjure man . I kin cogitate it out on the juice harp , if I gets the chance . People all the time coming and going ; it 's enough to detract the strongest conjure man on yearth . " " If that 's the way you feel about it , " I said , getting up , a little sore , " I 'll be about my business . I do n't need a house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now you set back down , honey . Have an apple . The folks here 're mighty nice  --  generous , too , and give me an apple . It 's only got part of one side chewed out . You take de rest , and welcome . Tell you the truth , old Zeb done let this place grin ' on his nerves . " " Well , that 's all right , " I said , picking up the apple . " It 's got me jumpy , too . They 're overloaded with females , for one thing . I feel sorry for that fellow Farrow . I do n't know why he does n't make a break for it some night late . He could braid a rope ladderout of bed sheets . " " I was cogitating him de very minute you come in , " said Zeb . " An ' I was gettin ' somewhere , too . " " In that case , go ahead . You cogitate him out on the harp while I finish the apple . " He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularlyeating his apple , but said he would give it a try . He commencedplaying , about ten times mournfuller than before , and I judged that if the music had anything to do with Mr. Farrow , he 'd might as well pick up a spade and go on out to the graveyard , because that music was n't suited for anything but a funeral . All of a sudden , the door flew open with a bang , we whirled around , and there was that older sister , Miss Marguerite , standingp109on the threshhold , as pale as death . She was breathing heavy , and opening and shutting her fists , so that the veins stood out on the backs of her thin hands . When she saw who it was , she tried to get control of herself , but she said , " Put that away at once . You must n't play that here at all . " After a minute or so , she added , " I 'm sorry to speak to you so , but I really ca n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly nervous , do you understand ? " I said , " Yes Ma'am , " and Zeb began some gabble about how he was out of practice but that she 'd enjoy it once he had his hand back in , but she spoke up very positive . " No , I meant precisely what I said . It distresses me to treat guests in this fashion , but you are not to play any further while you remain at Belle Mead . Do I make myself clear ? " We both nodded , and she left , after saying goodbye and askingZeb if there was anything he needed . " Now what do you suppose is eating on that old witch ? " I said . For once , Zeb could n't think of any satisfactory explanation , so I got up to go ; he was crushed down because he took her remarksto be in the nature of musical criticism , and stated that he was considered to be one of the best juice-harp players anywherenear Grassy . He said he 'd been invited to play with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitcase drum  --  at the town bandstand one Fourth of July , but he 'd run a catfish fin through his strumming finger , so they had to trot in a mouth organ at the last minute . He said he did n't want to sound unmodest , but he thought that was a pretty good record , or as good as she could produce on any instrument you could name , from the juice harp right on down to the piano . I hardly heard him . I knew perfectly well he was scared , and was only talking to put in the time . Twilight was coming on ; I could see it through the window . With all those oaks and hanging-down moss , it made things ghostlier than is common . Back somewhere in the quarters , I heard a baby crying , then a dog barking , and down toward the river the bullfrogs were tuning up . The locusts were sawing away , too , complaining aboutp110the summer weather , and I ca n't think right off of a miserabler sound , especially when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time since I came in , I noticed Zeb 's room . It reminded me of Clarissa 's nice old comfortable shanty , and of Commercial Appeal , and I felt my eyes water a little . The shiny new adventure of this trip had rubbed off ; I did n't particularly want to go anywhere except home . I knew Zeb was studying me , so I went back to staring out of the window . For some reason , I could n't figure out an offhand way to leave . " Well , " I said , without looking around , " I guess I 'll  --  " and choked up . Then I felt his ox 's arm around my shoulders in the kind of hug I could n't remember from anybody except the darkies at Grassy , because my aunts were n't made that way and my mother was gone practically before I 'd got out of the cradle , and I had a good cry . " You go right ahead , chile . You let her bust loose and git shet of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I rec'llect when I was nussin ' yo ' Uncle Jim through the campaigns , and we was sleeping many 's the time on the ground , and without any blankets , either , my min 'd turn back home , and I 'd feel powerful blue . It ai n't anything to be ashamed of , being homesick . It shows you belong someplace . " " I 'd like to see Grassy , and my aunts , and everybody .. . Clarissa , too . " I could see a worried look come into his shiny , broad black face , and he said , " You may be homesicker ' n I thought . You get too homesick , it 's onhealthy . About . all I care to see of that Clarissa is her south end as she 's retreating no'th . She got a tongue like a blacksnake whip . " " I do n't care . I 'd like to have her bawl me out . I 'd like some of her fried chicken and biscuits . " " Each pusson to their own taste , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in peace . Now I tell you what we 'll do  --  I 'll han ' you a saying to think on tonight , so as to get your min ' off home . 01 ' sayings is best , and they come true , too . Now , then : If a young man will eat a hundred chicken gizzards , he can marry the girlp111he wants . You go on up to de house , and remember that , chile ; it 'll come in handy . " " I do n't want to get married , " I said . " I 'm too young . " " You will ; you sholey will . " " What 's more , I would n't kill a hundred chickens to marry the Queen of Sheba . It 's absurd . Over and above that , a hundred chicken gizzards would kill you . There would n't be any wedding ; it 'd turn into a funeral . " We jawed back and forth about it some , and I left . He was a hopeless case ; there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a crowbar . Uncle Jim once told me all those sayings were genuine , including the ones on marriage , but he said they were so complicated they were dangerous . He was dead right . I 'd already tried out two , and got in trouble both times . On the first , he told me to place a horseshoe over the doorway , and the first person that entered would be my future wife . Well , I did it , but the first person that entered was my Aunt Effie , who 'd smelled smoke , and when she jostled the door , the horseshoe fell down and hit her on the head . The second time , Zeb said : Walk backward at sunset to a fence and cut a notch , looking over your right shoulder . Do this for nine consecutive nights , then walk backwards to the house , and you will dream of your future husband or wife . I tried it , but it rained all day the sixth day , so there was n't any sunset , and I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd got up almost to the end when they took us visiting across the river for a spell , so that one blew up . I decided to give it one more show , but in walking backward to the house I tripped and fell into a ditch they 'd dug for a drainpipe and split my head wide open on a shovel . I was in bed almost a week , and during that time , one of my aunts accidentally got a look at that fence . At first , they thought a family of beavers had been at work on it , but Uncle Jim said he figured somebody was converting it into a picket fence . It was n't long before they hung the blame on me , as usual , and could n't wait till I got over my busted head so they could give me a licking.  |p112No  sirree , if that old fool thought I was aiming to contract for a hundred chicken gizzards , he had another think coming . I 'd gone through all that before . After I slammed his door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chuckle again , and when I looked back I saw his face in the window , grinning . And then , by Jupiter , if it did n't occur to me I 'd forgot all about being homesick . That 's what he was up to all the time . I did n't feel mad at him any more , but was glad he 'd come along . He was practically as smart as he thought he was , but not quite . I went on up to dinner , as they called it here . Because of us , they had it at 7:30 . One thing you could say about this bunch , they did things in style . Usually , there were only two important meals : a breakfast very late , by our Kentucky notions , and dinner at three in the afternoon . In the " mornings , " from one to three , they had what was known as " ladies ' visiting , " when sometimes a cousin or two might come in  --  never a stranger  --  and gossip on the veranda , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the parlors , if it was hot . In the afternoons , with dinner over , most everybody took drives , and in some spanking fine carriages , too . They had two made , as they said , by Rogers of Philadelphia , and one by Brewster , of New York , and their horses were mainly Kentucky or Virginia thoroughbreds . They even had a buggy swung on big C-springs , with a pair of imported Andalusian mules to draw it . These drives every day were necessary , because the aunts had to " take the air . " They 'd got it worked out in their minds that only the air along the roads was fit for human use , so when they came back they said things like , " My , how much better I feel for getting a little air ! " and " I just do n't know what I 'd do if I could n't get out and take the air . " I asked Uncle Jim about this , thinking that the air around Belle Mead might be putrified , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said that being towed on wheels over a dusty , ruttedp113road gave them the illusion of doing something important . He told me to go right ahead and breathe as much air as I pleased ; it was perfectly fresh , and would n't harm me . The third meal , at 7:30 , was what they described as informal , except on this day of our arrival . Afterwards it was in the drawingrooms served by butlers bearing great silver trays , and consisted of coffee , tea , chocolate , biscuits , sandwiches , and light cakes . Most all the family arrived in their very best dress and made polite conversation that was aimed to improve your culture . The whole business seemed pretty thick to me . Nobody talked about anything of interest , like fishing or hunting , but prattled on about the latest periodicals that had got in on the boat from London or Paris or somewhere  --  plays and books and concerts and such . Most of these people had " finished " their education abroad , you understand , and occasionally dropped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . After one go at these sessions , I ducked out . I concluded to spend the time down at Zeb 's , and avoid having my culture ruined entirely . Also , the food was better . The time I went , they combed and cleaned me up and set me next to an old biddy , in a little spindle-legged chair with a rickety table out of a " nest " before me , and said load up . I bit into one of the sandwiches , but it had a commodity on the order of watercress , or plantain , in it , so I tucked it aside  --  shoved it under the old girl 's chair when nobody was looking . She says to this effect : " Are you finding it amusing heah ? " " Yes 'm , it 's all right , " I said , " but there 's one thing I 'd like to get nailed down : do the fish ever bite in this slough ? " She did n't answer , but appeared interested , and even trained one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing a bead on a squirrel , so I felt encouraged to go on : " There 's another point ; do you generally use beef liver or doughballs for channel cat around here ? " I reckoned she did n't know , and was embarrassed , because she picked up her traps and moved over by somebody else.  |p114Anyhow  , I 've got ahead of myself , and must come back to dinner , or supper , in the dining room , on our first night here . The way it turned out , it was about as peculiar an event as I can rememberin my life , right up to the present . We sat around a mahogany table about the size of a bandstand , and ate off of what Millie later said was rare china and glass , with the best damask and linen , and candlelight from heavy silver candlesticks that had about ten branches , each one workingout of another , like limbs on a tree . Every person there , includingme , had a colored servant in a white coat standing behind him as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something ! Up above the table was a kind of fan , with several blades hanging down that waved back and forth . A boy generally stood off to one side and worked it by pulling on ropes , but it was n't hot enough tonight . This was a machine that one of the uncles , now dead , had brought back from India years ago , and out of respect to his memory they still called whatever boy operatedit a " punkah wallah , " the same as in the English regiments out there , they said . Mr. Paxton Farrow sat at the head of the table , with Uncle Jim at his right hand , and his mother , stiff and murky and unsmiling , at the other end . They had that rattle-headed sister , Lauriette , next to me , but Dr. Snodgrass was on her other side , thanks to goodness , for I did n't have to talk to her as he spent the time telling her antidotes about the Choctaw nation , where he said he was the chief medicine man emeritus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you stood off to one side and inspectedit , but the conversation scooted along in little spurts , like leaves in a gusty breeze , then almost fell off entirely  --  becalmed . I kept watching Uncle Jim out of the corner of my eye , whilst waiting for Lauriette to turn and say something mocky , but he did n't appear to catch anything in the air at all . But it was there . The old lady never said a word ; did n't eat , either , but waved back dish after dish that her waiter brought , and turned her wine glass upside down . Still , she was the picture of calmness compared to Miss Marguerite , who was asp115jumpy as a bobcat . She kept trying to fill in the talk with things that had to do mainly with Mr. Farrow , it seemed to me , as if she was recalling them for both him and Uncle Jim . But the goingwas uphill , and finally she played out , too . And after the aunts ran through their ailments , Uncle Jim took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he never put himself out particularly to be handy with small talk , but often preferred to smoke a cigar while giving the others a show . People always said he was a " good listener , " if he was n't in some kind of mischief , like shooting down the Ku Klux Klan . But now he took charge altogether . I never saw him so easy and graceful . Maybe charming is the word , no matter how sissifiedit sounds . He told about our trip , in very humorous detail , with friendly sallies about Dr. Snodgrass that caused a general laugh and brought about some witty remarks , also friendly and serene , by Dr. Snodgrass , and then of course , Lauriette had to tune up and say : " But what persuaded you and this darling boy "  --  waving at me  --  " and your lovable old darky valet to leave home in the first place ? There are so very few of our good families traveling down the river by skiff these days . " " Why , we had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Klux Klan , Miss Lauriette , " he said . " To drop into the vernacular , they were , they still are , after our hides . " " Mercy sakes , how romantic ! But then , you 're a fighting man , are n't you , Captain Burnie ? Still , though , that does n't quite explain to little old stupid me why you chose sides so peculiarly . " " It 's a long story , ma'am . " As quick as her answer came , it was n't quick enough to conceala sort of tightening - up that went around that table . She was ready to pursue it , but she happened to glance down at her mother , at the same time I did , and there was a black , beady glitter in that old lady 's eyes that would have squelched a magpie . And I 'm a tadpole if Uncle Jim still did n't notice anything . It was the first time in my life I realized that he did n't really havep116much sense . Those words come hard , about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were true . No , sir , he babbled right on , telling stories about the Mexican War , now , and taking more wine whenever the waiter offered it , having an all-around royal old sap-headed good time . " By the way , Pax , I miss those jew 's harp concerts of yours . They made Mexico almost a delight , Grimes or no Grimes . How about giving us a tune after dinner ? " Leaning forward , Miss Marguerite said , " Oh , no ! " very quickly , as if it was important , but Mr. Farrow laughed and exclaimed , " I have n't touched it since the war . The fact is , I took a positive aversion to it , and have n't even got an instrument at the moment . " I 'd told Uncle Jim about Zeb and Miss Marguerite , but since he did n't speak up , I started to say I knew where I could borrowone , but I chanced to catch his eye and it was just about the same feeling as being slapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a hurry . " That often happens , " Uncle Jim said smoothly . " The things we 've enjoyed most in the past suddenly lose their flavor for no reason , and we leave them behind . It 's a pity . " He was about to go on , but something was happening to Mr. Farrow . His face had taken on a feverish look , and now he leaned forward , in a trance , his eyes glazed , his body trembling , and saliva working out of the corners of his mouth . One of the women half rose in her seat , motioning to a servant , but Mr. Farrow sat back , the trembling all gone , and broke into a very loud and disgusting song . Nobody moved a peg while he sang a verse and chorus , having to do with a lady that was employed in the lower part of Natchez , working nights , as I got it , and kept time by beating on his wine glass with a fork . When he finished , Miss Marguerite started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but Uncle Jim went right on and resumed his antidote that had been interrupted in the middle . From first to last , he never turned a hair.  | "  --  so neither of us was responsible , for once , but a wild ram of a fellow , and a corking good soldier , Alan Shelby  --  you 'll rememberShelby , Pax , the straw-haired kid from someplace up North , Illinois or Indiana ? " " Yes , a most attractive youth , ingenious , too , " said Mr. Farrow , smiling . He was fully recovered from whatever it was , and the whole company , including me , sat back in their chairs , more comfortable . After dinner , as I was walking up from the river , I passed Uncle Jim and Mr. Farrow , both smoking cigars to keep off the mosquitoes , and after they went by , deep in talk , Uncle Jim called to me and sauntered back . " I wanted to remind you , Davey , " he said in a normally loud voice , then almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at midnight . Tell Dr. Snodgrass and Millie . I 'll join you there . On no account permit yourselves to be seen . " My insides froze up with the chills . I had n't any idea what was going on , but I knew that tone , and it was usually the preliminary to something terrible and violent.  |p118DousE  THAT LAMP  --  put it on the floor in the corner and rig a quilt over it , " Uncle Jim told Zeb when Dr. Snodgrass and Milliesqueezed in through the door . " I do n't want even a peep of light leaking out . Draw that curtain tighter . Good . Now , keep your voices low , and we 'll get on with this . " The room was nearly dark ; I could see their faces in pale outline . For once , neither Dr. Snodgrass nor Zeb said a word , and Millie slipped her hand into mine , waiting . " It 's time I explained why we came to this place . As you may have guessed , it 's more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that simple . " " If you do n't mind my saying so , Captain , " said Dr. Snodgrass , demoting Uncle Jim again in his concern , " this Mr. Paxton Farrowof yours is a very strange man . " " Ah , but you see , " replied Uncle Jim , with a thrill of excitement in his voice , " this is not Paxton Farrow at all . " We all gasped , and Millie sounded as though she was about to get the fantods . " You are perhaps suggesting that he has undergone a mysteriouschange of character , " said Dr. Snodgrass . " Twice during the course of my prac  --  " " What I mean is , the man here representing himself to be Paxton Farrow is somebody else , another person entirely . I expectedit to be so when we arrived , and it is so . I 'm not certainp119yet about the dark deception being practiced in this house , but I mean to find out everything , make no mistake about that . Farrow was my friend  --  we shared the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I will find him , even if blood has to run again in the streets of Vicksburg . " I knew it ; it was always his way . First off , run down two or three thin leads , and then get the guns going . Nobody could walk softer , or speak gentler , but when he decided that reason had thrown in its hand ( and it did n't take long ) the bombardmentcommenced . It made me uneasy . It had caused him a lot of trouble , and everybody hoped it was over . I suspicioned he would mosey on up to the house now , ask this humbug Farrow a courteous question or two , and then blow his head off . But I misjudged him  --  maybe I was overly scared  --  because he said in an unbloodthirsty voice : " I 'd better give you the background of this unfortunate business . Farrow and I were comrades . After the war , we corresponded , oh , say , every two or three months , a pleasant exchange of reminiscence and news , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took place . Then there came a lapse of nearly a year . He had described the members of his family , and eventually I wrote a note of inquiry to his mother . In time , I had a reply from the sister , Marguerite , who said Pax had embarked on a leisurely trip around the world  --  the Grand Tour . ' " Well , this was n't uncommon , but he 'd never mentioned it before , and for some reason I could n't put it out of my mind . I had no letters from abroad , so after two years had elapsed , I wrote again , this time to the sister herself . Well , lo and behold , his old correspondence resumed , and from Belle Mead , too . But not quite in the same handwriting . Oh , it was close , very clever indeed , but it was not the handwriting of Paxton Farrow . I have the paid opinion of a Memphis expert on that . And the contents , while accurate in the main , appeared to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain happenings that might establish his identity . " Time went on , I meant to act , but the war came along , andp120other things were forgotten . I tried to trace him through the Army , but had n't any luck . When I got out , I resolved to look into this curiosity , at the very first chance . That arrived , courtesy of the excellent Ku Klux Klan , and here we are . " " Major Burnie , " Dr. Snodgrass spoke up , restoring his old rank , " now that you 've seen the , er , incumbent Farrow , what are your reasons for declaring him a fraud ? Are the two dissimilar in appearance ? How can such a substitution be made in a plantationsociety where everybody is known to everybody else ? " " They are absolutely identical . But you see , Paxton Farrow was wounded in Mexico  --  a bullet creased his forehead . This fellowwears no such blemish . There are other points ; I 'll mention only one , for the moment . You may recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about one Alan Shelby , a member of our regiment ? " " Yes , it struck me you were anxious to put him on the record , especially after that singular fit of ep  --  " " Yes , yes , " said Uncle Jim , cutting him off pretty short , it appeared to me . " Well , no such person as Shelby existed . I merely threw him out as bait . You heard the response ? Our precious Mr. Farrow of the moment knew him well . " " Then , in the name of all that 's holy , who  --  " " Later . Right now , I need your help . " " Sir , we shall back you to the limit , " said Dr. Snodgrass , graspinghis hand , and it was easy to see he meant it . " Fraud and deceitcan not , must not , be counten  --  "  --  he took another hitch at it --  " Of all the human vices , frau  --  " then he gave it up , and said , " Let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we must see that justice is done . Fraud and deceit are condonable on some levels , but not on others , if I make my distinctionclear , sir . " " You do , doctor , " said Uncle Jim , without any sarcasm , for once . He liked Dr. Snodgrass , and once told me , " Do n't let his bamboozling of the public fool you . Down underneath , that old reprobate 's got a streak of integrity a yard wide , as well as the guts of a government mule . " Such a statement was rare with Uncle Jim , and I had n't forgot it . Still and all , I did n't knowp121what it meant . I guessed it meant Dr. Snodgrass had n't robbed a bank yet , or poisoned anybody for the insurance . " Zeb , you 'll have to be the key fig  --  psst ! What 's that ? Blow that lamp out  --  jump ! " I did so , and Uncle Jim crept to the door , then burst it open with a heave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whacked into them ; then I heard a patter of running feet  --  bare , it sounded like . The night was blacker than ink , so there was n't a chance of seeing the person , and Uncle Jim caught my arm when I started to slide out and follow . " Not yet , not just yet . We 've got to tread carefully . What I 'm interested in is the welfare of Paxton Farrow , not in an open rup-ture . " " Those footsteps were n't headed toward the house , " I said , " they were headed toward the quarters . " " Let it alone for now . " But when he told Zeb what he wanted , Zeb set up a howl . " White folks ' biznuss . I get to messin in it , they take and snatch my head off . In addition , I 'm too old to go traipsin aroun the country after dark . I apt to fall down a well . " " See here , you woolly-headed idiot , " said Uncle Jim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're the same age I am . Exactly  --  same year , same month . I 'm tired of hearing you talk about being old  --  ' 01 ' Zeb this ; ' 01 ' Zeb that '  --  It 's sickly . You 've taken on an Uncle Tom complex . What 's more , it 's disrespectful of me . I 'm not old . " Well , all that was true enough . Ever since I 'd known him , he 'd considered himself elderly . Right from the start . He was always making excuses because of his age , even when he was under thirty . He 'd done it so much , by George , I 'd begun to think of him as old . " Fust thing I learned in slavery wuz to keep clar of white folks ' biznuss . My pappy seen to that , and I ai n't forgit it . 01 ' Zeb  --  " " By Godfrey , there it goes again ! You heard what I said  --  figure out some other way to describe yourself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way I know . I used to it . "  | " Well change it to Young Zeb . ' " " What ? And be laughed out of town ? People 'd think I'se talking about a baby , and I ai n't got no children ; you know dat . " Then Uncle Jim did what I 'd never heard him do before in my whole life  --  referred to himself in practically a favorable light . " Look here , Zeb ; is the Ku Klux Klan all white folks ' busi-ness ? " " How you mean ? " " Is Ben Woods ' business my business ? " Zeb thought it over , and said , " I wuz goin ' to do it all along . They was n't any question of doin ' it ; the main point was when . I was n't ready before , but I is ready now , and as far as taking a header down a well 's concerned , I can tote an eight-foot pole , flat out to de ground . That way , you hang up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth is , he was babbling like a wild man , not making any sense at all , but he was mighty scared , and I did n't blame him , so Uncle Jim said I could go along , and at daytime , to make things look good . We 'd be exploring the country , and could do it in our rig , except at the very end . " And for God 's sake , drop all that drivel about the pole . That would look nice and normal , would n't it ? Now , these darkies are n't Farrow people , not a one unless I miss my guess . Somewherein this region , you 'll find a family that belonged right here on Belle Mead . They 'll be cautious , but they 'd also like to see the truth come out ; I 'll bet on that . My suggestion is , make your final approach to an old man . Very old colored people do n't care so much what happens to them . Nearly all the bad things have happened already . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stealthy and quiet , and by and by I did the same . Next day , Zeb and I had our hired rig hitched up and rattled off into the countryside , headed in no special direction . We took a lunch along , after I 'd swallowed my pride and asked one of Lauriette , who gave me a funny look that sent shivers down my spine . It was a nice , hot , dry sort of morning , and driving along thesep123dirt roads was pleasant , even behind a horse that kept stumblingall the time . Casting around for a means of getting people 's ear , I figured we could go up to darky shacks and ask for a drink . Zeb could say his master , which was me , had just got over a sickness while visiting in Vicksburg and needed the country air . People are alwaysready to believe in somebody else 's bad health ; it helps keep them from getting sick themselves . We ran on for several miles , with Zeb going up for a drink five or six times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to mentionhe once had kinfolk at Belle Mead , and see what happened . He told me everybody he met was friendly , and urged him to drink as much water as he pleased , so that after a while he 'd drunk all he could hold , and maybe a little more , and gave me a warning about it , so we were out of business for awhile . By now , I 'd got my own appetite so whetted up about this mystery I could n't sit still . I 'd got to find a way to sort it out . But we did n't get anywhere that day , or the next , and the one after that was hog-killing day at Belle Mead , so we all stayed there to watch . The whole plantation force was out at the hog pens with their knives sharpened . Stripped down to the waist , they looked like pictures I 'd seen in schoolbooks , where African tribes were fighting each other or dancing , you know . Uncle Jim said that some day , when things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these people would be our best athletes , for they were about the only ones that were n't living soft . Anyhow , one after another of the boldest spirits , watching their chance , dashed into the hog pens and slashed a throat , with a quick thrust , and then scampered out , for a bunch of maddenedboars and sows can be pretty dangerous , smelling death . You never run across such a hullabaloo of squealing , feet flying , dust raising , yelling , and laughter . When a hog was down , they 'd wait their chance , and drag him out and plop him into a kettle of scalding water . Then the women , and even the children , commenced scraping the hair away , and asp124soon as he was clean , with the bare skin showing a kind of speckled blue and white and red underneath , very naked and flesh-crawly , they 'd string him up to the beams , head down . Now the oldest women brought tubs and put them underneath , to catch the blood , and a buck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the purple guts  --  yard after yard of tubes and pipes , and lots of other objects , too , but none of them very agreeable to look at , separated from their natural geography . They made this hog-killing day at Belle Mead a kind of ritual , as Uncle Jim said . The rule was that all the family , including the faintest-hearted women , if any , should stand to one side and watch . It was supposed to show that down underneath the whites were as tough and knowledgeable about unpleasant things as anybody , but had risen above them . So there they were , a row of fluttery and humbuggy painrackedaunts and the like  --  not fluttery , now , but standing perfectlysteady and unmoved  --  watching , keeping up the appearancesbefore the hands . Well , I got one setback out of it , anyhow . All of a sudden , I noticed Millie , beside me , breathing heavy and clasping and unclaspingher hands , which were pressed tight against her bosom . The skin of her forehead was glistening , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning was n't that hot . And when one big strapping fellow with very bloody , tight trousers ran in and stuck his knife into a squealing hog , I thought she might have a spasm . I could hear her moan , then see her tighten and untightenher muscles behind , so I said , " You do n't have to watch this ruckus , you know . Why do n't you go up to the house and drink some cold lemonade ? " She practically hissed my head off : " Shut up , you numbskull ! Leave me alone . " It went to show that women were all crazy . There was n't a thing to choose among them ; all alike , and as troublesome as snakes in the skin-dropping season . I did n't know what she was excited about , and did n't much care , so I went over to stand by Lauriette , who was deathly pale . I did it to get even , shuckingp125her off for the most troublesome person on the place . But Millie did n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hogs stretched in long rows , they lit open hickory fires and started other boiling pots , and this was the part I liked . The hickory smelled sweet in the early morning ( for they performed this operation after sunup , before things got hot and the flies turned out on watch ) with its blue swirls rising up from a dozen fires , and everybody was busy and happy . The excitement died down , even on Millie , who looked washed out but peaceful , and everybody slacked up in an astonishing way . I was handed a pig-tail to fry over the coals , and a bladder to blow up for Christmas . And afterward , we stayed to watch them make lard and grind sausage . It was educational . I wished the principal of the school back home could have seen it ; it might have pried his mind off the Golden Age of Hercules for a change . For days after those hog-killings , the whole place has a regular picnic , eating , with not only tenderloins and spare-ribs for breakfastbut cracklin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Jim said the skin of every darky there would shine like polished ebony with hog 's grease for a week or more . We had hog-killing at Grassy , but it was done different , without all this style ; also , my aunts did n't care for it , and kept me busy at the house . Well , Zeb and I picked up our search the day after , and hit pay dirt on the first whack . Rattling along a nice shady road through thick pine woods and occasional fields that opened out , we encountered a shanty set back a ways with a well in front . By now , I was thirsty myself , so I said we 'd both go up and get a drink , and we did . Not a soul in sight except two or three pickaninnies rolling an iron wagon-tire hoop , so we knocked . Presently a neat , comfortablyfilled-out woman with her head done up in a red bandana  --  just like the Northern picture-posters  --  came to the door and studied us over with a shrewd look. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridiculous flourish , and says : " Yes , Ma'am , me and the young genleman respectively wukked up a thust  --  " " The dipper 's yander , hangin by the well , " she says , and then to me , after studying us some more , " You druv far , suh ? " For some reason , I decided to let caution go and take a stab right out and open . This woman was smart ; she was satisfied we were strangers interested in more than water . " We 're visiting Belle Mead , the Farrow place , " I says . " Mr. Paxton Farrow 's place . " I was n't mistaken . Her eyes narrowed a little ; she looked different . " My uncle was a friend of Mr. Farrow in the Mexican War . " " Mistuh Paxton Farrow ? " " And Zeb , here , had some kin living there once , but they do n't seem to be there any more . " She just waited . " Uncle Jim thought maybe we could get a trace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to disturb the Farrowsabout it . " I went out to the well , with Zeb trailing behind , and let her mull it over . When I returned to say thanks , the pickaninnies had knocked off hoop-rolling and were plastered to her legs , peepingaround , two of them sucking their thumbs . I said , " We 're obliged for the drink . I guess we 'll be getting along . We 've got a lot of ground to cover , if we ever locate those kinfolk relatives . " She was trying to make up her mind ; finally she said , " If I'se sight-seeing , I turn right down about half a mile er so . Where they 's a rusted-out bed-spring restin aginst a tree . It 's right purty on towa 'd the crick . " " That 's fi  --  " " An if you gits lost , you kin alwuz ask of man Uncle Ned Pete . " She waited a second , and added : " He 's a curiosity . " I was on fire to get going , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she called me back :  | " You , boy , " she said . " Yes 'm , Aunty , " I answered , feeling easier with a natural form of conversation . " You ask him , hear ? " " Yes 'm . " " He 's the onliest one ; the uthers uz sold to New Orleans before de wah . But Uncle Ned , he could n't be sold ; he wuz set free by Mr. Paxton Farrow . " " Yes 'm , Aunty , " I said again , not able to think of anything real smart , but when I made a motion of leaving , she said , " But I never tol ' you , hear ? I 'll gainsay it , time it comes out . " " Yes 'm , I 'm obliged again , Aunty . " She 'd been looking pretty fierce , her face screwed up in fright , over what she was telling , but it smoothed out now , and she said , " Mr. Paxton Farrow done a good thing for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then she turned and walked inside . We were off in a minute , the horse kicking up a cloud of dust , and seeming surprised , too , at a whip being laid across his rump . " By jingoes , we 've got it ! " I exclaimed at Zeb , but he was getting a fit of the holy terrors , now , though he was still game enough . White man 's business scared them , and it was easy to understand . Uncle Jim said they 'd lived in a flinched condition for more than a century . We hit the crossroads , saw the bed-springs , and turned to the right . Within a mile , the road started sloping downhill , all leafed over overhead like a tunnel , then it meandered along another broad creek , or slough , and finally passed a homemade houseboat , tied up beneath some low-hanging branches . " That 's it ! That 's where he lives ; I 'll make any bet on it . " Zeb grumbled , not wanting to stop , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sight , letting the reins drop so the horse could eat grass . There was n't a chance of him running away ; the only danger was to keep him from lying down . To a Kentuckyperson , he was a mighty poor excuse for a horse , even a buggy nag.  | " Uncle , we 've come to talk to you about Mr. Paxton Farrow , " I said when he came on deck , a little shriveled monkey with a face wrinkled like dried mud . " His friend and my uncle , Captain James Burnie , of Kentucky , wants to know . He 's a good man . " I could n't figure out any other way to say it ; the words just popped out . It was said he was over a hundred , but he stood erect , and his eyes had n't that watery , dull look you see in most old people . They were sharp and alert , watching first one of us then the other . He lived alone on that boat , and fished in the creek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row it . He made corn bread in a skillet , and darky neighbor families brought him greens from their gardens . To pay back , he gave them catfish . But they did n't expect it , and a woman young enough to be his granddaughter , but not young , either  --  past sixty  --  came to check him nearly every day . With a man that age , you forget how old his children 's childrencan be . I explained us to him , and did it entirely above-board . He listened as sharp as a person of twenty . But when I finished , two small tears from old , nearly dried-up wells rolled out slow from the corners of his eyes . Then he said in a voice as dry and brittle as a yellowed-over newspaper that 's been shut up for years in a trunk , " I wanted it to come out befo ' I passed . " But he was shrewd , for all his age and good feeling , and declinedto let us come in and talk just now . He said we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Jim had suggested , so we had to stir up our horse , which was full of grass now and about as active as a bale of hay , and stump off . Nobody saw us ; that 's what I honestly believed . Well , it was a nuisance and botheration to put in the time till dark , because we could hardly go back to Belle Mead , then rig up all over again . Somebody would spot us sure . In the end , we decided to jog into town  --  it was n't far  --  marking the road so as to find our way back , and take a snooze on the houseboat . But when we got there , we could n't believe our eyes . It wasp129gone , and so was that ferry . It did n't take long to locate the houseboat , though ; it was tied to a half-sunk scow , and when we inquired round for the ferryboat , a man said it was back in business again . The owner , who 'd been crippled off and on for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got well . The man said he 'd been taking a new medicine , and it hauled the kinks right out of him . He 'd thrown aside a cane he 'd been using and gone to a fiddle dance with a woman half his age . The man that told us said nobody had heard him complain in three or four days , which they said was some kind of record . So there you were . Dr. Snodgrass was right all along . All a person had to do was believe in those medicines of his , and you had a running start toward recovery . Anyhow , we bought two catfish from a fellow that ran trot lines , went aboard our old craft , and cooked up a whacker of a meal . It was the first satisfaction I 'd had to my stomach for nearly a week . Some people may be able to get nourishment out of watercress and conversation , but I 'm not one of them . Zeb turned in for a nap , but before I joined him , I gave a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Uncle Jim at Belle Mead . Without coming right out , I hinted we 'd be held up late , and while I did n't say why exactly , I put it so he 'd know . Then I went back and took a long nap . In the evening , we fooled around town , looking in windows , and about nine o'clock headed for Uncle Ned 's . It was full darkp130before we arrived , and down the creek road it was spookish and scary with movement . I could have sworn I saw , or felt , upwardsof a dozen monsters , but probably it was the Spanish moss dancing in the breeze . I began to get the jimjams inside , and Zeb was so quiet it was painful . I never knew him to be as silent as that before , except once when he had a toothache and they tied up his jaw with rags . The truth is , it was so dark we could n't see the horse ; we just let him have his head , and stumble on . Presently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place where he ate grass before , because I smelled the creek pretty strong , cold and fishy , and heard gurgling ripples where the current split on a snag or something . When we climbed down , my knees sort of buckled , and I heard Zeb say , " Lordy , lordy , " and then , again , " White folks ' biznuss . " The most annoysome thing was that the crickets and locusts and cicadas and bullfrogs , which had been droning and sawing and booming away like a sawmill , all knocked off work the instantwe got out of the buggy . I never realized you could miss them ; I felt like I 'd been shoved out naked on the main street of Memphis at high noon . I do n't know what we expected to find inside . By now I was so rattled , I would n't have been surprised to see that crinkled-up old man hanging from a rafter . No light showing , and not a sound on the boat . It was enough to grate on a gorilla 's nerves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ran a long plank from the deck to the bank , taking it in at night , because they said he was afraid of ghosts . But it was something else that worried him ; I found that out soon enough . Well , the plank was down , so he had n't forgot . We tiptoed up , and I gave a light rap on the door . When no answer came , I pushed it open and said , softly , " Uncle Ned ? You in here , uncle ? " All of a sudden , more accustomed to the pitch-blackness , I saw two greenish glows  --  like a cat 's , over in one corner . I could feel my heart , along with various other objects on duty in the neigh/borhood , jump up in my throat , and when I started to turn and bolt : " Shet de do ' . " It was the same brittle worn-out voice , thank heavens , and it went on to say , " Strike a light . " Zeb lit a sulphur match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man sitting on a stool , with a rickety shotgun patched together with wire and plaster-tape lyingacross his knees . " I fixin to see it was you , and not somebody else I could name . " The astonishing old man had fished at night so long he could see like a cat , in addition to his eyes looking that way . I ca n't explain it , because darkies ' eyes are brown , not green , and so were his , mostly . But they looked different , even in daylight , and at night they shone . I do n't know the reason , but it was so . " Fetch in de plank , " he said , and when we did it , he said , " Snuff de light , " and Zeb blew it out . Then we sat in the dark and waited.  |p132MISTUH  PAXTON the goodest man what ever lived . Everybody alluz happy when he 's aroun ' , alluz . But Mistuh Paxton daid and ben daid sence long befo ' they fit de Yankees . " He went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably more old tears rolling down his crinkledy cheeks , and felt sorry for him . He talked nearly an hour , and I wo n't try to put it all in his words , because the darky speech down here was different than around Grassy and I could n't nail it down to sound exactly right . Even with Zeb it was n't easy ; sometimes he said " de " and sometimes " the , " and other things see-sawed back and forth , the way white people do . Nobody talks the same all the time . I got the main points as he went on letting it pour out after a good many years , all his stored-up angriness and grief over a pleasant life that got smashed up because a few people were mean and greedy . Now and then when he got excited the words tumbled out so fast or the speech went back to so near African that I lost the drift , but I soaked up enough to know what I needed . I could n't wait to get back to Uncle Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , now . They came and tol ' me often enough , makin threats . Back when it happen ' , they sol ' everybody off to different places south  --  babies snatched from mothers , man and wife cryin and sobbin goodbye  --  a thing Mr. Paxton cut off he hand befo ' he do  --  but they could n't sell me.  |p133I  uz free ; I wuz de oldes '  --  I spec I'se older'n God , mighty near  --  and Mr. Paxton sot me free . He say nobody ought to live that long belongin to somebody else . He say he sign a doc'ment I belong to myself . It wuz the fust propity I ever owned , but I spec it done depreciate considerable here lately . " I commenced to get fidgety because there was no telling how long he might ramble on , now he 'd started . He had waited a long time for this moment , and I hated to ruin it but it was time to go . I told him he 'd be all right , that Uncle Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the plank when we left , and keep his shotgun handy . Then Zeb located a box of carpet tacks and sprinkled them around on deck , in case anybody tried to swim out and sneak in barefoot , which was a jackass idea , but I let him have his way . If possible , the night had closed down blacker than before . We had to edge along , feeling every step down the board to shore , and found the buggy only because the horse nickered . Its outlines were in no wise visible at all . I swung myself up to the driver 's seat and reached for the reins , but somebody was sitting to one side , and had them already . A familiar-sounding voice said , " Tell the nigger to get in the back , " and Zeb did it , but I heard him moan a little . He did n't have to guess what was coming . Another person was in the back , too , and more were nearby , sitting quietly a-horseback . For a second , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a thin hand fastened hard on my arm , and the owner said , in a pleasant voice , " Do n't do it  --  my impetuous friends might spill your brains on the ground . " Well , something snapped ; I do n't know what . It had n't anything to do with courage , because I 've backed out of things less troublesome , but I sprang up in the seat , still clutched in the grip , and yelled , " Watch out , Uncle Ned ! They 're here . " The words rang out in that still night like church bells . I reckoned you could heard them half a mile . Something struck the back of my head , and I knuckled under in a heap on the buggy floor . But I was n't cold-cocked : I stillp134knew what went on , and even in the fluster of horses ' hooves and curses , I heard Uncle Ned 's door slam , and after that a splash , and the sound of oars working in rowlocks . " He 's cut for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody sung out , and two or three riders , spurring their horses down the bank , let go five or six shots over the water . And then , if you believe it , there came a shotgun blast  --  likely aimed at the flashes by that spunky old fellow  --  and one of the scoundrels gave a gasp , which was followed by a heavy thud , like a bag of pork being dropped to the ground . " Rollie 's hit  --  " Then a sound of dismounting , and , " Holy Mother Mary !  --  his whole side 's blown away by a scatter-gun .. . he 's dead ! " " Come on , come on , " said the voice at my side , with as much concern as you might get from a spider , " We 've got work to do . Take care of him later . " He whipped up the buggy , and we streaked off down the road , followed by the men on horseback . I do n't know how long we rode  --  perhaps only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rail gate was flung aside and we clattered through and into a big building  --  a cow barn or stable . The door was swung shut after us . " Show a light . " In the lantern-glow , I looked around and all these men were wearing black masks not quite like the Ku Klux Klan 's but close enough for discomfort . My seat-mate , a slender , dandified fop who even though masked was a dead ringer for the present proprietor of Belle Mead , swung himself gracefully down and said , " Now , we 'll teach you what happens to meddlers . String them up . " " You mean hang ' em ? " " Stretch them out for a flogging , you fool . We ca n't have the whole of Vicksburg on our necks . Flogging 's one thing  --  it 's the normal form of rebuke hereabouts  --  but murder 's another . People seem to boggle at it . " " Well , ca n't we hang the coon ? Nobody 'd mind that . "  | " It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance . Better to snake some manners into his sooty hide . " They grabbed Zeb , in a half-fainting condition , and strapped his wrists to an iron peg on a rough oak pillar , leaving nothing but his toes touching the ground ; then I saw my chance and wrenched free . There was a hayloft , and I scrambled straightaway up the ladder . My foot slipped between rungs , and somebody grabbed it , but I kicked him in the face and threw myself over the top . As I did so , I rolled onto a smooth-worn hay-fork handle , and you can bet I grabbed it like a long-lost brother . Then I stood on the edge and jabbed it down , dancing like a crazy person . I was so mad , and scared , too , that I babbled , but yelled , " You lay a hand on him and I 'll throw this through the middle of your belly ! What 's more , when my Uncle Jim 's told , you 'd better say your prayers . " " Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White or black ? " " You can take off the mask , Mr. Farrow , " I said . " I know all about you , you miserable cowardly humbug . Your turn 's com-ing ! " He made a motion to one of the masked bullies , and a heavy braided whip lit into Zeb 's back . I could see dust spurt out of his homespun shirt . His knees buckled , and he moaned again , and cried , " Aah ! " " Throw it down  --  you 'll both be let off easier . " " Come and get it . " The biggest of those villains  --  there was something familiar about him ; I could n't put my finger on it  --  started up the ladder . " Now , sonny , we 'll see if your money and uppity airs can solve this . " I waited till he was one rung higher , then drove the fork down . I reckon they thought I was bluffing , because he let out a surprised howl  --  painful , too  --  with two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then he landed in a heap on the floor . " By God , we 're paying heavy for this night 's work , " anotherp137swore . " One dead and one stuck like a pig by a shirttail boy  --  " " You have n't even started yet , " I screamed , blown up like a rooster with success . I felt so cocksure I failed to notice that one had edged into the shadows , so I did n't realize anything was wrong till he seized me from behind and tore the hay fork out of my hands . He 'd climbed up the chute while I was clapping myself on the back . It usually happens that way . They hustled me down in a hurry , not too gentle , either , and strung me up alongside Zeb . " Before we start , " said the fop , " this is what you will get , multiplied a hundred times , if you ever repeat a word of what you heard tonight . Do you understand ? " Neither of us answered . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out like an animal ; I could n't help it . I felt somethingwarm run down my back , and then it lit again . I do n't know how long it went on , but by and by I saw Zeb hanging perfectly limp and unconscious , with saliva coming out of his mouth , then things began to blur . Very dim , a long way off , I heard somebody say , " That may be enough . I think the nigger 's dead  --  he had a dozen too many . " But the fop 's voice spoke up , cheerful and happy as a lark , and said , " Fetch the tub of coarse salt . " One of the men whose voice I did n't know answered , " See here , I 'm all for punishment , also I 'm beholden to you financially , but there 's a limit to what I 'll see handed to a boy . It may be fine for you , and for these northern trash "  --  I was n't too far gone to wonder at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frankly , I do n't know as I 'll be able to look at myself in a mirror for awhile . " " With your face , I do n't blame you , my friend . Fetch the salt . Or would you prefer to see your wife and brats turned out into the road ? " The next thing I knew , I was screeching and crying and twistingaround in the straps , and Zeb was doing the same . " Rub it in . Rip off the rest of their shirts , and grind it in everyp138stripe . A lesson learned halfway is a lesson to be learned over . Let 's do them a favor and finish the job in one sitting . " Off to one side , water seemed to be running , and a night wind blew on my face . I felt grass against it , too . My wits began to come back slowly . Groaning , I tried to push myself up to my hands and knees . The sky was still dark , but a pearly glow off to the east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chile ; let him hep you . " It was Zeb , though I could n't exactly see him , and then the old man , Uncle Ned Pete , coming back from the creek with a poultice made of nobody knows what . It was very fiery , then wonderfully cool and soothing . " Don ' move , " he said . " Let it wuk , else you be left with bad scahs . " " Zeb , " I said , rubbing at my eyes with one fist . " I thought you was dead . " " I mighty nigh daid , honey , mighty nigh . I wished I wuz daid , there for awhile . " And then  --  " White folks ' biznuss . " That was all he said , but it was enough . " I remember , and I 'm sorry . Uncle Jim 'll try to make it up . I know that . " " Chile , I wished he did n't . I'se scared to think what Mistuh Jim 'll do when he hyars . He goin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said , and meant it . " I hope he kills the whole bunch . I 'll help him . " The old man shushed us , saying they might come back , and after that he left to get our horse and buggy , which was grazing , or part of it was , nearby . That dried up little tough prune of a hundred-year-old darky had rowed across the river , then rowed back , upstream , and followed us . If a person was looking for a case of outright rashnessunder fire , this was it , because he 'd come clear up to that barn and peered through a crack , watching everything and then trailed along afterwards to where they tumbled us out on the creek bank . And , as Uncle Jim remarked later , he had nothingp139to gain but his neck in a rope over a limb . He was a splenderous old man , but I thought lying there with his poultice cold on my back that he was in a real pickle now . Something had to be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Being an orphan , with my mother and father checked out early , I never much learned to cry , but I could n't help it during the ordeal of getting up in that buggy . Zeb , too . Our backs were torn to tatters , and the slightest movement stretched the skin and started the bleeding up . But it had to be done . " Jog , do n't resh . An ' do n't set up to drive . That horse 'll fotch back de same road . " I asked him where he was bound . " Into de bushes , boy . I been there befo ' . You want me , you go to ' at same woman 's . She 'll know . Giddy-ap , now ! " and he spanked the horse 's rump with his palm . We got there just as dawn had fresh arrived , and the horse stood near the front door , kicking at the ground , but we could n't have climbed out of that buggy if our lives depended on it . All I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tried to think up some way to attract attention ; then I heard Zeb tune up on his juice harp , and it turned the trick . There was a sound of slippers scuffling on the upstairs veranda , a door slamming , and then running feet down below . Lauriette . In nothing but a night dress . I could see her pale face staring at us as we lay stretched out in the buggy . She had one hand clenched and pressing against herself . " What is it ? What 's happened ? Oh , my God , your back  --  " Her cries rousted the place up , and I do n't remember anything else for awhile . When I opened my eyes , I lay on my stomach on the big tester bedstead in my room , with nobody there except Uncle Jim and Dr. Snodgrass and Millie . He had shut the rest of the family out , not very gently , they said . He had n't shaved , so I judged he 'd  | " When you 're strong enough , tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get tired , stop . Hold on , wait a minute . " He stepped to the door and opened it , and by gum , I could see that monster , Farrow , standing there , as cool as you please . " Have my man , Zebediah , carried up here and placed in the other bed , " said Uncle Jim . Farrow smiled and replied , " We do n't make a practice of letting darkies sleep in the bedrooms at Belle Mead . " " There 'll be an exception in this case . " Their eyes battled a minute , then Farrow gave a little frown of annoyance , and said , " Nothing 's too much for a guest to ask . " " And be damned sure he 's handled carefully . " For a second , I thought they might have it out right there in the hall , but Farrow finally shrugged , and left . I did n't blame him . I 'd sooner tackled a buffalo than Uncle Jim in the humor he was in . They brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door was slammed , and made ready to begin , but Uncle Jim said , " I 'll save you as much as I can . In the first place , this fellow 's an identical twin ; he was mentioned to me once or twice . Second , he 's got epilepsy , and he 's no good . Now , what else went on here ? " " A good deal , " I said , talking mainly into my pillow . " I do n't understand it exactly  --  I could n't make out the old man 's speech  --  but  --  " Zeb spoke up to interrupt , as he naturally would ; I do n't know how he 'd kept his mouth shut that long : " Dey darky talk down hyar is coarse and ignerint and ai n't pure the way it is up to Grassy  --  Masser Davey 's right . He wuz hard to make out . " Uncle Jim clucked , impatient , so I went on : " This fellow is n't only no good ; he 's a feend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got in bad troubles , for one reason after another , and finally went too far . They were going to lock him up in prison , in Natchez or someplace , but the family and their doctor made an agreement to shut him away in a private asylum.  |p141Well  , about 1858 , according to Uncle Ned , Mr. Paxton Farrow took the fever and died , right here in his room . " Now I 'm a little hazy , but I think what happened was this : The old gentleman , Mr. Farrow 's father , willed Belle Mead down to his only decent son , because he did n't trust a blessed one of the others , and hated his wife like the furies . So he 'd left a provision that if anything happened to Mr. Paxton  --  ' dead or incapacitated '  - -  - the next in line was the old man 's brother in Chicago , to run Belle Mead as he saw fit until one of the children proved worthy of succession '  --  that 's the way Uncle Ned told it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Uncle Jim . " God knows how they expected to get by with it . Everybody knew Pax hereabouts ; they must have . " " The doctor gave out that his mind was left affected by the fever . He was delicate , and unsteady , and they 'd represented the other brother to be dead , a long time beforehand . Then they sold the slaves , because darkies will talk , you know , white man 's business or not , and kept to themselves . The fact is , they had n't ever been sociable around here . The old lady 's French , from New Orleans and looked on these Scotch and Irish as trash , and often said so , until the Vicksburg people did n't care to hear it any more . If you ask me , she 's the worst monster of all , except for the daughter Marguerite , or three or four of the others . I 'd like to see them all behind bars , including that wasp-tongued Lauriette  --  " " No doubt , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the ugly event of last night . Give it to me step by step . " I told him , but snuffled a little when I came to the whipping , and he got up and paced around . I could see Millie with her color high and eyes blazing , and Dr. Snodgrass fixing his attentionfor once directly on something besides doctoring . He looked pale , as if he could use a pull of Spooju . " All right . Are you sure it was this fellow Farrow ? " " He had on a mask , but I 'm sure . Who else had a reason ? " " He 'll be taken care of  --  do n't fret about it for an instant , butI intend to put the whole business here straight . I can do that forp142a friend . Now , are you quite certain Pax died a natural death ? " " The old man thought so . He did n't have any doubts about it . " " Well , I want them all , including the ruffians that helped out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll scatter . We 'll play it innocent for a day or two , then I 'll settle the score . Meanwhile , it might be over-charitable to let him rest easy . Call him in , will you , Doc ? " Dr. Snodgrass opened the door and told a servant , in the first hard tone I 'd ever heard him use : " Go fetch your master . Colonel Burnie wants him here at once . " In a minute or two , Farrow sauntered into the room , wearing a kind of mocky smile . He seated himself airily on a sofa . " I understand that I 've been summoned . " " I want your help , Farrow , in running down the cowardly skunks that hid behind masks to flog this boy and this darky . A person who 'd do a thing like that is either crazy or criminal , or both . And certainly he 's as low down as the foulest scum ever born , a slimy , sneaking , craven toad who ought to be stepped on and squashed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the first words , the color drained out of his face , and now he stood with his hands working at his sides . In a minute , he got his control back and said , " Most regrettable , but I do n't know the boy very well . Perhaps he found himself  --  by accident , of course  --  trifling with something dangerous . The times are touchy , and passions easily inflamed . The Ku Kl  --  " " But you see , " said Uncle Jim easily , too easy for him , " I 'm vouching for the boy  --  taking full responsibility for his actions . That puts us back where we started : how to track down the polecat that whipped him . It 's going to be my pleasure to stomp him personally . If he were a notch above the level of common scoundrel , I 'd call him out to duel . A gentleman ca n't duel with a toad . You can see the predicament I 'm in , ca n't you , Farrow ? " We held our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there might come an explosion at any time . But nothing happened , not yet.  | " Why , old friend Burnie , you do n't seem to be calling me Pax ' any more . Surely you ca n't hold me responsible for this outrage ? " " Now , I do beg your pardon , " said Uncle Jim . " It may be I 'm upset , and did n't recognize you for a moment . Nobody , even me , could call Paxton Farrow a toad in my hearing . He 'd have a fight on his hands . " The fellow hung up a minute  --  things were getting over-thick  --  then he turned on his heel and headed for the door , saying , " You 're right , of course , we must make every effort to find them . However ,  --  " he hesitated  --  " and it 's only a guess , I 'll wager the boy got involved in some old wives ' tale of the darkies hereabouts . Such stories are risky  --  and they 're often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help me find those villains , " said Uncle Jim . " My mind 's greatly eased . I 'll check with you every hour or so , to see how you 're getting along . " Farrow studied us from the doorway . Dr. Snodgrass had risen to his feet , and Millie 's face was so hostile I thought she might throw something . But it was Uncle Jim 's attitude that warned him off . If ever I saw a man anxious for an excuse to do murder , he was it . And Mr. Farrow was n't fooled . So he let things go , and left . Well , in the next day or two we found that even the worst of the Belle Mead women , including Marguerite and the old lady , were shocked by this happening , though maybe for the wrong reasons . The house was sunk into a kind of sullen quiet , with the servants tiptoeing around , and doors shutting very soft ; no noise anywhere . Marguerite had their doctor , a nervous , elderly redfacedman with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premises . He fussed around , but his hands shook so he dropped nearly everything he touched , and Dr. Snodgrass remarked afterward that he appeared to be suffering from a mania a potu , whatever that was . Anyhow , our backs began to heal up surprisingly fast , more because of what Uncle Ned put on than what the doctor did , Ip144judged , and we were up walking within three days . But we felt mighty stiff and sore , and were wobbly on our pins . Uncle Jim was absent most of the time . I heard he 'd driven into Vicksburg to see somebody , and I caught Mr. Farrow and the old lady whispering about it , in one of the shut-off parlors . The time ticked on , and everybody wondered what might take place , particularly the family , I reckon . There was no question about us knowing the truth of that household now , and the only thing that remained was to see who 'd make the first move , them or us . Theirs , of course , could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Jim gave Dr. Snodgrass a pistol and left him on guard in the daytime , and locked us in nights . Zeb had a revolver , too , so we were all right . In addition , and very insulting , Uncle Jim told Mr. Farrow he 'd require to have a servant outsideour door , to taste all the food coming in . It was the same as back in Pembroke , only this time he was serious . " You never can tell , " he said , with the old raspy manner . " Those scoundrels may somehow have gained access to your kitchen . " So the trays were brought up , the taster came in , and Dr. Snodgrass directed him from one dish to another . It was right in his line . " Fine , fine , that takes care of the corn  --  no stomach cramps ? No paralysis of the limbs ? Respiration normal ? Very well , let us pass on to the okra . I have a feeling we may hit the bull 's eye on that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because every bite he took he figured would be his last , and while he never did get poisoned , his insides were tied in such knots by fright that he had undigestion every meal , so they had to give him soda , and then castor oil to unstop him . He only lasted two days on the job ; they yanked him off more dead than alive , and warmed up a fresh starter . Dr. Snodgrass really threw himself into this thing . Aside from his humbuggery , he was a kindly , genteel man , with plenty ofp145courage , as Uncle Jim said , and his treatment of Mr. Farrow was about as abrupt as Uncle Jim 's . I honestly think he 'd have shot it out at the drop of a hat ; he was that aroused . In addition to the pistol , which he wore with the polished butt sticking out of his belt , in perfectly plain sight , as a declaration of possible war , he 'd taken down a Horstmann saber from a pair on the wall downstairs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was a sight . Before a week was over , I was so restless I took to slipping outdoors , against orders . Uncle Jim heard about it and caught me ; then he gave me a lecture , after which I promised to stay close to the house in the daytime and not venture out after dark . Zeb was established back in his quarters room , with the family that occupiedthe other half tending him . He was healing up , too , but he was mostly treating himself with his own remedy . Dr. Snodgrasslooked in once or twice a day , and they had a pretty hot argument over procedure . Zeb was the main doctor among the hands at Grassy , and considered himself as legal and qualified as anybody , but I heard Dr. Snodgrass tell Uncle Jim in private that his methods were so " primitive and antiquated " that he was little better than a quack . Uncle Jim had the good sense to give him a withering look , but it bounced right off . One afternoon , so hot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn in the centerboard skiff , which that Lauriette had showed me how to sail . It was the only thing she 'd done since we got there that did n't saw on your nerves like a file . This craft was balky and cantankerous , very apt to tip over if you went to sleep and caught a puff . Still , if you got a good breeze it was fun to run it down before the wind and then zigzag back . It refreshed a person , and blew away the cobwebs . When we first arrived , the creek-slough was more of a creek than anything , with a tolerable current , because the river level was lower . But now the river had risen several inches , backing the creek water to a standstill . So it was a slough again , and fine for sailing . Zeb was asleep , Uncle Jim had gone to town as usual , Dr.p146Snodgrass was in the library reading a book about saber-dueling , Millie was off somewhere , and the family were scarce as hen 's teeth . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour slide . Instead , they stripped down to their shifts , stayed in their rooms , and set up a howl for lemonade . So I climbed into the boat , hoisted the sail , and made off for a place I knew upstream a mile or more , where the family had a little summerhouse , circular and up-curving at the roof , on the order of Chinese . They commonly used to go there for picnics , on days when the mosquitoes lay low . With the wind at my back , I made good time . The water sloshed along the gunnels , and the canvas bellied out full and unrippled . It was nice . When I reached the place , I grounded the boat and walked barefoot toward the summerhouse , which was on a spring-fed pond they 'd cleaned up , making a little beach , for swimming . I thought I might take a cooling-off dip , up as far as my back , then poke around searching for water moccasins , which is a pleasant entertainment , if you do n't commence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the crooked path through thick bushes , I heard voices , so I slowed down . I figured it might be wiser to turn back , considering the fix I was in , but I crept on ; I could n't help it . Eavesdropping was one of the natural instincts of the human race , as Uncle Jim often said , and useful , too . For my part , I disliked to be rude ; and to deliberately not listen when somebody was talking was downright offensive . I 've heard Aunt Effie say so herself . I eased myself on , trying to place those voices . In a minute or two , I could peer through the bushes , and there they were , in the clearing beside the pagoda  --  Mr. Farrow talking like the slimy plotter he was , and two burly men with their backs toward me , listening . They had on ignorant , workmens ' black hats and rough clothing ; they appeared to be farm hands , but there was more to them than that  --  you might say they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that silent and purposeful . " There 'll be no killing near the plantation ; make no mistakep147about it , " Farrow was saying , causing me to wonder if I 'd misjudgedhim . " We 've protected this place too long to risk it on a toss of the dice . " One of the strangers said , " Now we 've come this far , we aim to finish them here , holler all you please . " I knew the voice well enough ; it was Coley Baxter , and when the other fellow turned around , I recognized him , too . Ab Mullins . There was n't any sign of his brother . " More'n twenty Dens throwed in to chase him down , and I spoke out for the job . He hazed me and others through the Army . This is grudge work . " " We 're in perfect agreement on the end ; what we 've got to settle is the means . Also the place , " said Farrow , and I was glad to hear it . I 'd built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't like to see it fall down again . " By the way , finish off the boy if you like , but Burnie 's my property . I 'll take care of him , and enjoy it . Now what I suggest is this : let 's do some figuring , and meet back here tomorrow , same time . I 'll have it worked out  --  do n't worry . " " The Dens said they got to be punished , no matter how long it takes . Me and Mullins was delegated , and paid . Ai n't they got a waggle-jawed medicine faker along with them ? And a blackhairedtitty girl ? " " Dr. Snodgrass , and his daughter . I told you that the other night . " " They stopped at Pembroke , and sold a saddle , likewise all day at Bosky Dell and hawked nostrums . It did n't take ary bloodhoundto trace them , time we located his horse . One of the mulatter niggers at Grassy told Ab 's brother . " So we had a sneak working up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , impudent complainer that had been north working in Indianapolis for a year and came back because he said ( very surprised ) that they were n't any decenter to darkies in the North than they were in the South . I made a note to write the MacReadysand let them know . If he was guilty , they 'd help Aunt Effie high-tail that buzzard off his job so fast he 'd run out of his shoes.  | " Tomorrow at noon , " said Farrow , obviously having a distaste for this rabble , and wanting to get the interview over . " But no funny business , " said Baxter . " I do n't set much trust in fancy vests . That 's the kind we 're after . " " See here , my man , are you threatening me ? " Farrow had a light in his eyes like a lunatic . " No threats , no promises . The Dens voted punishment , and I spoke out for it . He haz  --  " " Yes , yes , I 've heard your story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dens may want a say in it . " " One way or another , " said Baxter . Suddenly I had the inspiration to shift . In fact , it occurred to me I might be a little late , because all at once they started over in my general direction . If they had a boat , it was tied up above ; maybe they had horses . Anyhow , I lit out like a striped-tailed ape down that corkscrew path , but the first thing I did was trip over a root and take a header into the weeds . You could heard the racket in Jericho . " What 's that ? " I heard one cry ; then another , I think it was Mullins , said , " Cool off . It 's only a squirrel . You 're as jumpy as a tomcat . " I did n't wait to see how it came out , but got up and sneaked on down to the creek bank , grabbed the prow of my boat , and waltzed it along the bank , as deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the mast . It was rough going , with mud up to your ankles , and brambles , too , on shore , so when I 'd made two or three hundred yards , I stopped and listened . Not a sound . I pushed off , rattled up the sail , and struck out for the opposite shore . Uncle Jim was in my room , with Dr. Snodgrass and Millie , and I burst in and shut the door behind me , leaning there a second to get my breath back . When they rose up , looking startled , I said , " I 've got terrible news . The Klan 's after us . Coley Baxter and Ab Mullins are here . " Uncle Jim quietened me down , and I told what happened.  |p149When  I got done , he seemed relieved , and even chipper and perked up . " Capital , capital  --  we 've bunched them . I 'd been wondering how it might be done . Tomorrow may be a gala day . " Dr. Snodgrass had his saber and rope belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he got up now and put them on again . " Not this time , Doctor , " said Uncle Jim firmly . " It is n't your quarrel ; we thank you all the same . " " I 'm distressed to hear you say so , sir . Your decision comes at an unfortunate time , as I have spent the better part of two days delving into Lazlo 's Practical Hints for the Aspiring Duelist . ' I have no wish to be fulsome , but I believe I may now regard myself as a skilled all-around swordsman  --  foil , epee , or saber . " " Keep the book close at hand , " said Uncle Jim with an amused but kindly look . " We may have to call on you . " I lay counting sheep , too keyed up to sleep , and listened to Uncle Jim pacing to and fro in the room next door . The house was uneasy . There was a squally wind , which made the frameworkcreak : a shutter was loose some place , besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racket that I concluded to find it , if possible . About half of these rooms were empty . I slipped along the carpeted hallway in the solid dark , for the lamp that was kept lit at the stair-head had gone out ; blown by the draft , I reckoned . When I reached Lauriette 's room , the door suddenly opened and a hand grabbed me and dragged me inside . Another clapped over my mouth when the door shut , but it was wholly needless : I could n't have mustered a mouse-squeak . All the brashness had drained right out ; I did n't figure on doing any more exploring for thirty or forty year , even if I lived through the night . She said , " Where were you going , little boy ? " After a few gulps , I got some breath back and began to roil up . I jerked my arm free , and said , " What 's the matter with you , anyway ? You trying to scare a person to death ? " I could see her pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd dabbed on  --  she was that close . I did n't care for the scent , which was sickly-sweet but with a tinge of something sharper to it , on the order of a skunk . I figured it probably cost a dollar or more a bottle , being imported , but I preferred Millie 's smell , which was a combination of sweat and maybe some powder or cologne sprinkled on to keep from having to take a bucket-bath on deck in the early morning , when nobody was looking . " Back off some , " I said . " I do n't like to talk in people 's faces . " Well , it was true , but I 'd never said so right out before . " Are you afraid of pretty girls , little boy ? " " I 'm afraid of everybody in this house , and I 've got a healed-up back to prove it . " " Why did you come here ? Why did n't you leave it alone ? " She practically hissed the words out , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had better be watched , and commenced to sidle out . " Wait ! There 's something  --  . You ought to know something . " I hung up , but figured she 'd slip a knife between my ribs , so I tried to keep from getting too near . " Things here are n't what they seem . I mean , you should n't make up your mind . Even very old darkies do n't always  --  " " You can save your breath , " I said , interrupting . " I know what things are , and so does Uncle Jim . But they are n't apt to stay that way long . Tomorrow  --  " " What , tomorrow ? " She grabbed my arms like a crazy woman , and shook me so my teeth rattled . " Speak up , little boy . For your own good . What about to-morrow ? " " Let it go . I would n't care to discuss it . Nothing . Why do n't you go to bed ? If I was dressed as skimpy as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I once asked you what kind of man your Uncle Jim was . I can tell you now  --  he 's a fool . " I started to rip out something pretty brisk , but decided itp151would n't do any good , so I wrenched free , snatched the door open , and wriggled out of there in a hurry . The lamp still was n't lit , and the old house twisted and groaned and skreeked like a ship in a storm . It was one of those wild nights , when a body would do better to stay in bed , maybe stuffing up their ears with cotton . But I still heard banging , and by this time I 'd got into a humor where it was either the shutter or me . I 'd recovered my spunk back . If I did n't get that racket stopped , I 'd might as well sit up and twiddle my thumbs till dawn . So I pushed on down the corridor , feeling my way , knowing where most of the tables and stands were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was the first time I 'd been there , and as soon as I opened the door I was sorry . While most of the house was complaining in the wind like a whiny old man , this part was silent as a tomb . I did n't care for it , but I crept on , curious now , besides being interested in the shutter , which had quit . Even on a hot , muggy , summer night , it had a cold feeling . Some of those old houses ramble back longer behind than you 'd think from the front , and the wing here was a sample . I begun to get the nervous shakes again , drat it , what with that row of tight-closed doors , and when a roach scraped over the floor , I jumped half out of my skin . I turned to go back , and then , by jingoes , I caught a whiff of cigar smoke . It was a smell I could recognize perfectly well . A minute later , I heard the sound of somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I stood there , with my neck hairs bristling up , and could n't help but think of Miss Marguerite on the night in Zeb 's cabin . This place was one too many for me . I decided to remove myselfout of the wing and quit messing with what was n't any of my business . But I heard somebody coming down the hall ; regular footfalls , light , like a woman 's . My nightshirt being starchy white , I was as bold as a signpost , so I scrunched down behind a heavy carved chest that somebody 'd carted back from a tour , I judged . If you put togetherp152all the high-priced junk that southern people fished out of Europe before the war , you could stock a hundred museums , but none that anybody in his right mind would pay ten cents to enter . The footsteps moved past , soft and even , and I recognized the scent , too . It was Lauriette ; waiting , I heard her open a door , far down the hall , then all was quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so there was no use backing out now . But when I stood up to follow , a match scratched directly behind me , and I smelled cigar smoke again , this time very strong . I whirled around , with the ginger drained out of my knees , and saw a fiery red glow , which burned brighter for a second , then swung down in a circle . " Get to bed , Davey , " said Uncle Jim in a calm low voice . " We 've got a busy day tomorrow . " " What 's happening in there ? Some devilment 's up ; I know it . " " Never mind . Go on to bed . You 're out of your depth here . " When I got back , I lay a long time awake , waiting for the powwowof trouble to start , but none ever did , and eventually I drifted off to sleep , while the house shivered and shook and the storm howled on.  |p153W  ROWED across the stream , Uncle Jim and I , at a few minutes before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the sky was left drippy and overcast . After hiding the boat , we started up an overgrown path along the bank . I 'd never come by land , so we had to look sharp to find the place where you turn in for the spring-water pond . Then , as before , voices were heard before we overhauled the owners , there in the clearing . We pushed forward slowly , parting the bushes to look . Coley Baxter and Ab Mullins were early , I guessed , because Mr. Farrow had n't yet arrived . As you might expect , they were making windy threats about what they meant to do when they caught us . " I 'd give a pretty to see Burnie 's face , " Coley said . " Likely , he thinks he 's Scott-free by now . He 'll turn bottle-green . " " You figure to shoot him on sight or give him a chancet to draw ? " " If I know that fine-feathered dandy , he 'll be too petrified scared to draw . He 'll grovel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breed , and hate ' em all . And so did my Pa before me . " Mullins knew better than that ; he seemed doubtful , and said , " Well , he did n't do much begging at Ben Woods ' house . And him with only two single-shot pistols . "  | " That was different . Up to then he 'd had his own way . He figured to run a bluff  --  " " Mighty sorry bluff , " said Mullins , growing angry-looking and red . " It got my blood-kin cousin killed by that cub . It 's him I want . I 'm bound to acknowledge I gloried in that whipping . If it had n't been for Farrow , I 'd killed him . Him and the nigger both . " So it was Mullins that held the whip . I felt my stomach turn sour with rage , and came close to stepping out and cursing him , but Baxter spoke up to say , " What 's keeping that namby-pamby ? Truth to tell , I ca n't stand him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished with Burnie , I may just  --  " Uncle Jim stepped clear of the bushes and said , " You 're not finished with him yet . In fact , my friend , you have n't even started . " It was two against one , both with guns showing outside , while Uncle Jim came dressed in his usual decent manner , with a freshcleanedPanama hat from Peru , an embroidered vest , and a longtailedcoat over dove-gray trousers . But he was n't smoking one of those skinny black cigars for a change ; his hands hung loose at his sides . He was ready , and they knew it . " Where 'd you come from , Burnie ? " said Baxter , making a show of grit . He was dead-white , but Mullins was pitiful . He looked about to faint . He had n't lived all of those years near Grassy without knowing why Uncle Jim won medals in the war . What 's more , he was in Uncle Jim 's company , until he got kicked out with an unhonorable discharge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy ? " Mullins started to bluff it out , but changed his plans and said , " Farrow made me , he  --  " but Baxter interrupted " Look here , Burnie , let 's talk it over . We 're from the same town , and ort to stick together . Now , I 'll throw down my gun if you 'll do the same "  --  he tossed a revolver onto the grass  --  " and we can patch up past differences . " " Why , certainly , " replied Uncle Jim , reaching in his jacket and throwing his gun down . Then he unwound a twenty-foot braided whip from around his waist , and said , " But I 'm a greatp155one for parliamentary procedure , as I told you at Ben Woods ' , and the first order of business is to even up this boy 's score . Will you , or your friend , be first ? " " Coley ! " screamed Mullins . " Do n't let him ! Go ahead , like you planned ! " " Try me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those little derringers out of his shirt sleeve into his hand . " Now , by God , you 're going to  --  " They were the very last words he ever got out . Holding the whip in his right hand , Uncle Jim flashed another pistol from his coat and fired twice  --  I could hear both bullets hit with a solid " thock , thock "  --  in Baxter 's chest . He staggered backward , with a surprised look , as if it 'd been Uncle Jim that cheated , and sat down . He had one hand clutching himself , and for a few seconds just sat there , staring our way . It was enough to make your flesh crawl . Then a big fountain of blood bubbled out of his mouth and nose and he rolled onto his side , slack as a bag of wheat . " Coley ! " screamed Mullins again . He kneeled down to examine him but changed his mind and wheeled to run . Before he got four steps away , Uncle Jim 's whip looped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He rolled over and over ; then , on his knees , he commenced to beg . " Get up , " said Uncle Jim , " and flatten out face forward against that sycamore . " " For God 's sake , do n't shoot me ! They made me do it . " It was a lie ; just the same , I felt a little sick . " Fasten his hands around the trunk with this string , " Uncle Jim said , and I did it . Then he handed me the whip . " All right , there 's the fellow that ruined your back  --  those scars wo n't all fade out ; not by any means . Serve him the same way . " I gulped , taking the whip ; then I threw it down . " I ca n't , " I said , not able to look him in the face . " I 'm not that mad at anybody , scars or no scars . One killing 's enough . " " It was Mullins that shot Commercial Appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " I ca n't punish him in cold blood . I 'm sorry . " Putting an arm around my shoulder , he walked me across the clearing . " It 's all right ; it does you credit . Do n't worry about it , boy . Some day the world will turn its back on all violent men . At present , unfortunately , we 're saddled with swine like Mullins , and he badly needs a lesson . " Businesslike , he picked up the whip , shook out the kinks , and gave Mullins a thrashing that ripped his shirt into red pennants . He chopped his back into mincemeat , the same as mine was . For the first two or three minutes , Ab screamed the trees down ; then he fell into a kind of low , blubbery cursing . It was an ugly scene , played out at high noon there in the woods , but I could n't help watching , though I tried to take my eyes away . Uncle Jim cut him down , yanked him up to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't with him , " pointing to Coley Baxter . " It 's what you deserve . Now go back to Hanksville and tell your brotherhood I 'll shoot you down like dogs , all of you , if ever I see you again . Hear me , Mullins  --  the next time I look on your rat 's face , I 'll kill you  --  do you understand ? " He gave him a push , but it was n't needed . Mullins disappeared into the bushes at a rattling good clip , considering the condition he was in . Then Uncle Jim wiped the sweat off his head with a handkerchief , and cleaned up his hands . " Jim , Jim , " a familiar voice floated out from the pagoda . " No change , I see ; none at all . The storms still gather around your head . " We moved fast , and Uncle Jim 's pistol glittered in his hands . Dealing with Coley Baxter was one thing , but a man like Farrow was something else entirely . Mr. Farrow was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemeddifferent . It was the same face , but of a different color  --  pastywhite and blotched over with brown . Still , he had on the samekind of clothes , with clean white gloves and a gold-headed cane . I felt the chills run up my spine , but Uncle Jim 's frameloosened up and relaxed . He put the gun back under his coat . " So it 's you , Pax . I thought so . " We started forward , but thefigure in the pagoda said , " Do n't come any closer ; it might n't bep157healthy . Stand there and let me look you over . By God  --  Jim ! You 're a sight ; I 'll be damned if you are n't . " " What is it ? " said Uncle Jim . " Tell me , or I 'm coming up  --  nothing 's going to stop me . " Farrow laughed . " I do n't imagine so . You 'd do it if you had to shoot me . " " Well , I will come . Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't stand idly by  --  " " You ca n't solve leprosy , and neither can anybody else , it seems . " " But how  --  ? " " Do you recall the Grand Tour ? I dallied too long in the Sandwich Islands  --  a girl . You might say those islands were the tour . Then I spent a year in the leper colony at Molokai , after which they brought me home by private schooner . Now you ask , why did n't I write ? " He drew off his gloves , and held up a hand , showing fingers that were hardly any more than sponges . " But I can still strum Jew 's harp , using my knuckles . Good luck  --  what ? " " Why did n't you send me the truth ? " " I was afraid you might come down , and they were dead set on installing Rex "  --  that was the brother  --  " to avoid losing con-. trol of the estate . " " Something 's got to be done , " said Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll see to  --  " " Not a thing , " said Mr. Farrow cheerfully . " The best doctors have bumbled through all the present stages of attempted cure , from chaulmoogra oil up , or down . With my type of the illness , called lepromatous , there is n't any at present . One progresses from lesions of the nose to thickening of the skin to claw hands ' to leonine facies '  --  the mottled color  --  and , after ten years or so , to his heavenly reward . " By the way , do n't feel too hard toward the people here . Their little deception  --  they felt they were doing their best for us all . Maybe they were right . I 'd rather die at Belle Mead than in some lazaretto of rotting strangers . "  | " But what kind of life has it been  --  all these years ? " " Not at all bad , not in the least . There 's very little pain . I 'm around , here and there , driven in a buggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth when times are opportune . I 'm no prisoner of that room , not a bit . Think it over , Jim  --  they 've taken their chance of contagion , every last one . And they risked their freedom by a false death and burial . Fortunately , it 's only communicable in conditions of squalor and filth . Not a soul ever knew the truth , not even old Uncle Ned . Nobody knew but Farrows . " After a minute , Uncle Jim said , " Does your charitable impulse include your precious brother ? " " Well , now , that 's another matter . You 'd better look alive there . When the mood 's on him , he 's as bloodthirsty as a weasel . And he 's mixed up with the odious Ku Klux Klan . " " Then what do you suggest ? " " Clear off , in a hurry , with my thanks and my blessing . Tonight or tomorrow . I talked him out of here today , for old friendship 's sake . But I ca n't hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I do n't know why . " It was the first time I ever saw Uncle Jim at a loss . He took off his hat , then wiped his forehead again . By and by he said , " I 'm sorry , Pax . I sure as hell am sorry . I wish I could think up something brighter than that . " " Good old Jim . " Mr. Farrow began hobbling down the path on the opposite side , but before disappearing from sight , he turned and shouted , " Whatever happened to old Grimes ? " " I shot him , " said Uncle Jim . The laugh that burst out was as merry as a person 's without a worry in the world . Then the bushes swallowed him up , and we were left alone in the clearing , except for a dead man on the ground . All of a sudden , I wanted to get as far away from this plantation as I could . In the afternoon , Uncle Jim and Dr. Snodgrass sold the houseboaton the quiet ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee , which was due in Vicksburg tonight . They got two cubby-hole single rooms and a nice big double one for Dr. Snodgrass and Millie . Zeb had to go deck passage and eat with the hands . But Uncle Jim gave him fifty dollars for the misery he 'd suffered , and he was in a fair-to-middling humor , for him . So little medicine was left on hand that Dr. Snodgrass sold it in a lump to that undisposed ferry-boat owner , who was doing a prosperous business again , in the very best of health . It fetched a good price , too . The man was pinched for cash , so after some haggling Dr. Snodgrass took twelve dollars hard money and an I.O.U . for seventeen one-way rides across the river . Uncle Jim pointed out that this would leave him stranded on the other side , without any way to get back , but Dr. Snodgrass said he 'd likely have more medicine by then , and could make a new arrangement , and maybe wind up with the boat . He was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave , I felt better than I had in weeks . I 'd sunk so low , I 'd almost forgot there were places better than this . The prospect of getting out , of seeing some new sights , smelling new smells , and continuing our adventures to Cayo Hueso made my healed-up back seem like nothing , and Zeb he said the same . Our departure , toward evening , was peculiar . Things were done different at Grassy , where the people ( except for Aunt Effie ) were looser in their manner somehow . Nothing was seen of our main host ; only two or three women showed up to see us off . The aunts and cousins had been flattened by their ailments , I judged . To our surprise , though , the old lady came downstairs , as usual dressed in black , and said to Uncle Jim , " I wish to tell you , at last , that we understand your motives for coming to Belle Mead . I thank you on behalf of my son . " Uncle Jim was by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he said , " Which one , Madam ? " " Goodbye , Captain Burnie . " That old ramrod did n't promote him ; she was n't the kind to get his rank confused . She had ap160mind like a carpenter 's square , and kept things in plumb every step of the way . When we climbed up into the rig , I looked back and saw Lauriette at one of the windows . As I stared , I thought she started to wave , but she must have changed her mind , for she let her hand drop and turned on away . Now I 've got to describe pretty fast what happened when we left , because I 've dwelt long enough on this part of our journey . We drove in and paid our bill for the horse , then a darky set us down on the wharf . The boat had only just arrived , but it had a powerful lot of lumber and cement to unload from up river , and a cargo of cotton to take on for New Orleans . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aboard , but a hitch developed after that in the form of trouble with the engine . So we checked into our rooms  --  and mine was cramped and dingy for such a gaudy big boat . But we were on our way , and that 's what mattered . Well , the time dragged on toward midnight , while the people including us went aft in little groups to look at the engineers working below in the lantern-glow . Finally , just as I suspicioned , Uncle Jim said I 'd got to go on to bed . Nobody else had to go to bed ; no , sir ; only me . It turned out that way every time . It was rotten close quarters up there , with two or three pipes running along the roof over my head , so that if a person raised up from his bunk in a hurry , he was sure to dent one with his head . I never saw such a hole ; things were roomier in a wardrobe . They 'd told me to latch my door , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while I was dozing off , and when I collected my wits to call " Who 's there ? " a voice on the outside said , " Your Uncle Jim . " I should have known better  --  he would n't identify himself in that ridiculous style  --  but I was sleepy , and opened on up . They pushed in , two of them , stuffed a gag in my mouth , snatched up some clothes , pinned a note to my bunk , hustled me out on deck , then down a companionway on the dark side . After this , we wentp161overboard into a skiff . They had their oarlocks wrapped to muffle noise , but it was needless because of the racket in the engine room . Before we got to shore , they blindfolded me , and finally there came a rough , jouncy session in a buggy . When the blindfolds were removed , I was seated on a bench at a rude table in what looked like a darky shack , clear enough , and across the way sat Rex Farrow . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy  --  if we ca n't go to Mr. Burnie , perhaps he 'll come to us . " " You 're as good as dead , " I said , sick in my insides again . " He wo n't let you off this time  --  I know Uncle Jim . " " You know him ; fancy that . What excellent fortune , but take my advice and never fall into the snobbish habit of name-dropping . Now we 're going to play a game , sonny . What is your name , by the way ? As forceful a personality as you are , I keep forgetting . " " Sam , " I said . I was so mad I commenced skating on thin ice ; I could n't help myself . " Here 's how the game goes , Sam . You tell me where your uncle was heading , or my friend outside "  --  he rapped on the table and a coarse-looking man with crazy black eyes came in  --  " will assist me in choking it out of you . " By this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Oh , there 's no need of that  --  I ' 11 be glad to tell . " " Where , then ? And be careful . " My idea was , to get this fellow started off on as long a haul as possible , so I said , " Patagonia , extreme southern part . " I should have known better . I overdid it ; moreover , it was Millie 's fault for teaching me geography . Over-learning can get a body into a peck of trouble . He smacked me so hard I fell off the bench , and when I got up , wiping blood from a corner of my mouth , he said , " I told you to be careful . " I sat there for a minute , then said , " Mexico . " " What part of Mexico ? " " I do n't know . They did n't go into it . "  | " Where 's the gold map I heard my brother mention ? " " Uncle Jim memorized it and ate it . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody took in a pirate book I read . He half rose and grabbed my shirt , but when he reached over to hit me , an awful change came on him . His face froze , his eyes rolled up so that nothing was seen but the whites , saliva began to ooze from his lips , and his body stiffened up like a corpse . He was having a fit , and I jumped back out of the way to watch . Well , within a minute or so his face was a dull blue , like lead , and shortly after that he started to choke , as if somebody had a grip on his neck . Then he fell to the floor with a crash , and the coarse-looking stranger burst back into the room . " He 's got a fit , " I said , so as not to be blamed . " He 's swallered his tongue . Grab his arms while I prize it out . " I caught hold , hoping it would n't work , but the man stuck a spoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pulled up the tongue . But it was n't easy . In about ten minutes , Farrow was breathing regular , and opened his eyes to ask , " What happened ? Did I go off ? " " You throwed a fit , " said the stranger , not over sympathetic . " Help me to bed . " At the door , he turned around and said , " Tomorrow we 'll attend to your case . And be sure of this , sonny  --  whether your Uncle Jim "  --  he pronounced the name with a nasty kind of bite  --  " comes back or not , we 'll get him . As long as I 'm able to travel , we wo n't give up , not if it takes twenty years . " They locked me in , and I fastened the bolt on my side , mainly to be troublesome , for they could handily kick it in , and after an hour or so , I went to sleep on a cot without any blankets . It must have been a short time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boarded-up window , and a woman 's voice : " Let me in , David . Hurry ! " Well , I could n't be worse off than I was , so I opened up , and there was Lauriette , fully dressed , in a riding suit . " Come on , hurry ! We 'll need at least two hours ' start . "  | " Where to ? " I said stupidly . " I 'm leaving this house of horror . I ca n't live here any longer . And I 'm taking you out before you 're hurt further . " " How ? " " By horseback . Come on ; you can talk later . " " You mean you 're leaving for good ? Clearing off ? Not coming back ? " " Was there ever such a talkative brat ! I 'm leaving forever . That 's why I asked about your Uncle Jim . But you were too busy playing the dunce to answer . " " What if he comes to get me ? " " I 've left word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Morning 's coming , and they 'll drag us back . " Down by the creek , she had two horses saddled and waiting , with some luggage strapped on . But when we got there I rememberedFarrow 's last words , and said , " There 's something I 've got to do . Hold up . " " Dawn 's nearly here , you fool . Will you hurry ? " I knew what I was after , and found it  --  a heavy three-foot crowbar , lying against some lumber back of the kitchen ; then I felt my way around to the front door . They never kept it locked . I expect they figured that nobody in his right mind would care to prowl in that house , especially after dark , but this time they were wrong . What I had to do was the worst thing I 'd ever done in my life , but I could n't see any other course . It was best for all concerned , and anyhow he had it coming . I crept upstairs , knowing my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroom . There was n't a sound in all the house ; nobody stirring , and no sign of the coarse-faced stranger . I shut the door gently behind me and stood still , waiting to get used to the dark . In a minute or so I had him spotted ; he was sleeping , and snoring , on top of the covers , dressed only in a nightshirt . I took a deep breath , tiptoed over to peer down  --  I couldn'tp164afford to make a mistake  --  and made him out beyond a doubt . Then , aiming for a spot just above his right knee , I swung the crowbar as hard as I was able . I expected him to scream , but he gave a quick gasp that ended in a long , stomach-turning groan , a kind of sighing " Ah-ah-ohah ! " I did n't wait , but spun around and made for the stairs . BeforeI 'd returned the crowbar to its place , the screams began  --  awful and chilling  --  so I did n't tarry any longer . I streaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? For God 's sake , what have you done ? " " Returned a favor , and slowed up pursuit , " I said . " If you want to hurry , this may be a good time to do it . " She took the lead , at a gallop so fast I had trouble hanging on , and I followed just far enough behind to keep from being kicked . In the first streaks of dawn , I saw we were abreast thep165river , heading south , judging by the current , and before long we eased to a canter . But it must have been four or five miles until we stopped for a real breather . I felt poorly . It went hard to smash a sleeping man 's leg , without giving him a chance to fight back . But when I rememberedmy whipping , and Zeb 's , my conscience eased and I did n't care so much . Most important for us , there was one thing I knew for sure . Even if that leg healed up to be normal , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for many a long month to come . I put everything I had into that swing , and heard the bone snap like a dry hickory stick . By and by I took to thinking : They would drop by my stateroomgoing to breakfast , and find that note . But what if they decided to let me sleep , and a colored steward that could n't read came in to tidy up ? He 'd whisk the note right out in a dust pan without winking . If that happened , they 'd be ten or twelve hours down river before they recognized I was gone . And after that , would n't they calculate I 'd somehow tumbled over the rail ? Any way you looked at it , things were in a pretty poor pickle.  |p166AFTER  THINKING IT OVER , it seems best to let the story becarried on here by a letter to my aunts . It certainly is n't a very good letter , as it contains a considerable number of lies ( which the reader will quickly spot ) about the author of this book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was n't there , and so takes up the slack . In Transit , July 25 , 1869Dear Miss Effie and Miss Lou : Having been commissioned by your esteemed brother ( Lt. Col. James Burnie ) , my good friend and companion of the road ( watery ) , to convey news of import in his absence , I must reluctantlyreport that your nephew David has disappeared from the public view . The concensus of opinion is , I grieve to say , that his mortal remains may lie in the muddy bed of Father Mississippi . Without plunging into a detailed recapitulation , I should say that the expedition of Col. Burnie , your nephew , and the Colonel'svalet and personal ( unlicensed ) physician , Zebediah , soon became encumbered with the addition of myself , Dr. Ewing T. Snodgrass , D.C. , M.P . Ph.U. , and my daughter , Millicent , a frail , flowerlike creature whose excess of femininity serves , I fear ,  |p167to  retard our progress . Like her mother before her ( a musician of sensitivity , with a remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong . We joined forces in the tasteless village of Pembroke , Arkansas , and after a series of adventures and misadventures ( during which your obedient servant managed to clean up a health crisis in Bosky Dell , where pestilence conditions prevailed ) we visited the Vicksburg plantation of Col. Burnie 's whilom friend , Mr. Paxton Farrow . I shall not soon forget the bizarre problemsthat there confronted us . Suffice it to say that we were compelled , virtually under cover of darkness , to evade that foul den , aboard the steamboat Robert E. Lee . Now to the business at hand . Our company being largely disposedin small , individual staterooms , David was alone , and when the " rosy-fingered dawn " ( Virgil ) arrived , bringing with it the promise of breakfast , we decided to let the lad sleep . He had lately undergone physical reverses which I shall describe in anothermissive , with Col. Burnie 's permission . As there was no sign of his presence at noon , we again repairedto his room and this time were staggered to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , not to be located in any quarter of the ship . His bed had been occupied , we found , and his knapsack of small possessions , including a deceased and exceedingly fragrant mole , reposed upon a wash stand whose water pitcher appeared to be untouched ( typically in the case of boys his age , I believe ) . A negro steward under questioning revealed that the room was also tenantless at nine A.M. , when the bed was made , and that the door was seen swinginghalf-open at 7:30 . Now , certain surmises are permissible without casting aspersionsupon the character of this wonderfully promising child . Col. Burnie has affirmed that , upon receipt of an order , any order , such as a command to retire for the night , his instinct was to do exactly the opposite , and that just as swiftly as possible . Col. Burnie has also verified that the boy , having apparently been born with a species of monkey curiosity , was an eaves/dropper of rich and ingenious gifts . In addition , the mountebank Zebediah has emphatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been equalled in the long history of Grassy Plantation . I hasten to say , worthy ladies , that these traits , in the aggregate , do not provide an anchor on the road to progress . On the contrary , faithfully cultivated , and enhanced , they might well produce a man of distinction  --  a politician ; a banker ; an internationalswindler ; a great general , glorious in defeat ; even a President , if the owner could divest himself of any taint of conscience . So  --  we have opined that David Burnie  --  God soothe his activesoul !  --  may have tumbled overboard in the course of some prying , nocturnal stroll . Who knows what could have summoneda boy thus driven ? Laughter from a partially shuttered stateroom , a dice game among the lounging stevedores , an ambition to remove some nut or bolt of the darkened machinery on deck , an urge to bore a hole in the hull . Col. Burnie went straightway to Captain Ogilvie , who stopped the engines and began an exhaustive search . Nothing forthcoming , your brother then bade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us later in New Orleans , and went ashore in a lighter . He will inquire in villages along both banks of the river , back to a considerable distance . Meanwhile , we are , as you may imagine , in a state of deep mourning . It galls the undersigned to dispatch you such illomenedtidings . Let us pray that my next communication may be in the nature of pealing church bells , heralding the great news of discovery and restoration . David could swim  --  there can be no question of that . At an island where we once tied up , he negotiated a broad deep slough and returned carrying a very substantial load of pilfered corn in a sling on his back . It would have done credit to a thief twice his age . So there is some chance , we think , that he might have made his way to shore . If that is true , the nearest community would of course be alerted , if not up in arms , very shortly . And on that note of restrained optimism , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ofp169you , his loved ones , at Grassy , and an avowal to keep you abreast of the intelligence as it develops . Your respectful friend ( by proxy ) , Dr. Ewing T. Snodgrass , D.C. ; M.P. ; Ph.U . At the time Dr. Snodgrass was composing that idiotic note , Lauriette and I were sloping along down river , steering around towns and staying shy of people . The first night , we hid and slept in a hayloft . In her saddle bags , the girl had brought two loaves of bread , two tins of fish , a long sausage and some fruit from Belle Mead . So we had a tolerable supper , with the horses tied to a tree beside a fresh-water creek , a good distance off the road . For once , she appeared untalkative , except for bossiness now and then , like most females . What they do in the case of a boy , I figured , is work in all the high-handed orders that they 're able , to pay up for being run by a husband later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toothbrushes , and when we finished eating she handed one over , with instructions to scrub up . I told her I was generally in the habit of brushing my teeth when and how I pleased , and had been doing so for a number of years . " Then let me see your toothbrush . " " I do n't remember saying I had one . I lost it . " " Do you want your teeth to rot and fall out ? " " Well , " I said , " George Washington did n't have any teeth . They put in wooden ones , but it did n't slow him up much . He went right on and bagged a very nice situation , according to some people 's lights . " Anything along that line , any kind of argument , caused her to fall right back into her old fakey speech , so when she said , " Littleboy , you 're just so cute and cunning I could eat you up , " I brushed my teeth in a hurry . A little of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horses , went to the bathroom , in different directions , and moved on.  |p170After  dark we located a farm set back by itself , and waited for the people to blow out their lamps for the night . Then we pegged down the horses to graze and crept toward the barn . But she was nowhere near as smart as she thought , for she would have tramped right on up , regardless of where the wind lay . " No you do n't , " I said . " These farms have dogs , and there 'll be a pow-wow if they scent us . We 'll smouch up from the other side . " Now in the hot summer there was nothing in the barn but a mare about to foal , but she never bothered to whinny , having her mind on her family , I reckon , so we climbed on up to the loft . A breeze blew in through the opened hay door , and the hay was clean and fresh and sweet-smelling . On top of that , we had a nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't any better perfumery that I know of  --  besides traces of other animals and fowl , on the order of goats and dogs and chickens that wanderedin and out of there , and altogether it seemed like one of the best places to sleep I ever struck . But she took on as if she was about to bed down with pigs in a pigsty . She says , " What a vivid stench ! I thought you said barns were ideal places to stop , darling boy . " I could have argued , but did n't , only suggesting that she go on back to the grove and sleep with the horses , if she felt bottled up . The fact is , I was sorry for her , because I realized that she probably had n't ever done this sort of camping before . They lived soft at Belle Mead . " You 'll be safe out there , " I said . " They do n't often see bears in this country , and those they see are generally harmless , unless one has cubs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe snakes and wild dogs , there is n't a thing to worry about . Aside from poison ivy or oak . " She gave me a mean look , as I punched out a place to lie down ; then she had the downright cussedness to make me undress out of my clothes . She said , " It is n't sanitary to sleep in your daytime garmentsp171like a tinker . We 'll observe a few amenities here , no matter how gipsy-low we sink otherwise . " So I pealed down to my drawers , then called a halt . " I 've got a little regard for the amnesties myself , " I said , " and privacy is the main one of them . Do whatever you like , but I 'm through . If necessary , and it should n't be , I 'll wash these drawers out every few weeks , but as far as you 're concerned , this is my sleeping outfit , so you 'd might as well get used to it , and live with it . " She went ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moonlight , humming , and stripped right off to her skin . Then she took a silk nightgown from her belongings and prepared to put it on , but she was n't in a rush about it . She paid me no more attention than she would a cigar-store Indian . It was humiliating . I gave a kind of cough , and by George , I meant it to sting ! " You sound a little croupy . We 'll have to get you some tar syrup tomorrow . " " If it would n't place any strain on you , you might cover yourselfup , " I told her . " This is just an ordinary barn , not a Show Boat . " " Oh , bosh . You 're not that sensitive . Have n't you got any sisters ? " " None that strut around rump-naked in front of strangers . " " How old are you , you precocious little cuddlekins ? " " Fourteen , " I said , and turned over . Confound the creature , she 'd spoiled my sleep , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and stole out before anybody saw us . For three more days we did exactly the same thing  --  slept in barns and picnicked along the way , making ourselves as small as we possibly could . Twice we stopped at drowsy , littered-up general stores , removed from the main river route , and bought things , but only one of us went in at a time , lest the organization have a description out about a boy and young woman traveling together . On top of that , we mumbled some tommyrot about visiting in the neighborhood . And then , on the fourth day , she said we were far enoughp172along to continue by steamboat . So we struck back for the river and jogged along it the better part of one afternoon , or until we got to a sizable town . Then we found there was a St. Louis boat due in that night , and Lauriette bought two tickets to Orleans , fishing some yellow-back bills up from between her bosoms , right in front of everybody . " Now , about these horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a likely price for them ; saddles , too , if we strike the right dealer . But you 've got to be careful . Most of these fellows are as crook  --  " " Not on your life . And have them traced back to Belle Mead ? We 'll give them away , and do it back in the country from town . " Well , that was one too many for me . I 'd rather been caught than give away two perfectly sound horses , and said so . But she was correct , as time proved out . Even so , you never saw so many precautions . She hired us a rig , which I drove while she rode one of the horses and led the other . The boat was due at round about midnight , so we rattled back into a poor section of one-horse cropper farms , and then , at the last minute , she changed her plans . " We wo n't give them away  --  it might arouse too much curiosity . We 'll turn them loose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this entertaining , because I imagine it was the first time in her life she 'd ever done anything on her own . A person living in that frosted-over hermits ' hole of a Belle Mead might just as well have retired to a monkery and resigned from enjoyment . So after a while , when dusk came on , she saw a darky farm that looked tidy and neat , with no trash in the yard , but picked up and raked as respectable as anybody 's , and she turned her fine blooded stallion  --  an expensive and beautiful horse , though mean like her  --  loose in the pasture . " They 'll find it , and inquire around , then keep it , I hope , " she said . The whole rigmarole was ridiculous , of course , but I had to play along ; there was n't any help for it . We stuck the saddle in ap173barn of another place about three miles down the road , and then we did it all over with the other horse . After that , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I never ran across anybody so puffed up with virtue . " They 'll find those horses and saddles useful , " she said . " I 'm glad they have them . " " What 'll probably happen is that some innocent , hard-working darky man , father of nine or ten sick and starving pickaninnies , will be hauled up for horse-stealing , and hung . No , I ca n't say you 've done anybody a good turn here today . " Her eyes flashed and her nostrils kind of opened in and out . " They would n't dare ! " Then she thought of an easy way out , and said , " In a day or so , I 'll write a disguised letter to the local newspaper and explain what I 've done . That ought to fix everything . " And let me put in here , so as not to forget it later , that she went right ahead and kept her promise . She wrote a very flourishy note and showed it to me before mailing it at a landing where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ castings . Somehow it made me feel better about her , but not for very long . At midnight , we boarded the Jacob Gruber , which was one of the big Mississippi packets , over four hundred feet long and having a forty-four foot beam with double side-wheels . Best of all , it was one of those new low-pressure boats and had it painted so in box-car letters on the paddle casings . Here lately there 'd been a lot of explosions on the high-pressure boats ( which were cheaper to build , of course ) and people were happy to ride on the low-pressures for a change . They had a better chance to arrive at where they were going . It had n't been so long ago that anybody 'd forgot the Moselle 's boiler bursting at Cincinnati , from building up steam to beat anotherboat , with a loss of two hundred fifty lives . Or the fire aboard the Ben Sherod , racing the Prairie below Natchez , that burned or drowned two hundred passengers and crew . Or the Monmouth , carrying six hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those poor devils around from pillar to post , as they always did and still do ) running intop174the Trenton while short-cutting up part of the river where it had n't any business to be , and killing more than half of that tribe . Or a good many other accidents , more recent . People were scared of those high-pressure boats , with plenty of reason . Lauriette , who claimed to know a lot about steamboating , just as she did about everything , said a man named Charles Dickens , who was an Englishman that wrote very interesting books for a living , when he was n't too mad about something to work , took a trip on the Ohio in 1840 and expressed himself as being uncomfortableall the way . " It always conveyed that kind of feeling to me which I should be likely to experience , I think , if I had lodgingson the first floor of a powder mill , " he said . ( But I heard that he had a poor digestion , and was jealous of other writers , which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to be . There are n't many good ones around . ) Well , it was n't quite that bad , but we were happy to be on a low-pressure boat , just the same , and I felt peaceful for the first time since I left Grassy . If Uncle Jim and the others , even Millie with her geography book , had been along , things would have been perfect . We had a big , gaudy double cabin with beds , not bunks , along either side and a Chinese screen in between , and a window to look out of . It must have cost a stack of money , and I said so . " Poverty has never been considered among the unpleasant featuresof Belle Mead , " she said in an acidy tone , so I let it drop . I 'd met people that were purse-proud before , including CommercialAppeal once for a week after he found a dollar , and sooner or later they got their comeuppance . In his case , he invested in two rabbits off an Indian trader , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rabbits being inclined that way , but they both turned out to be males . They had entertainment on this boat that people said was above the ordinary . It was on account of the Captain , a portly , hee-hawing , red-faced jackass named Boomer , who was known as a riot of fun . He very much fancied his figure , which was stuffed pretty tight into a shiny blue suit with enough brass buttons to open a store with , and he cut a lot of shines amongst the ladies ,  |p175taking  them in little bunches to see this wreck , and that snag , and the like  --  all very dangerous , to hear him tell it  --  so that they would squeal , dainty and timorous , and look at him admiring , then say things like , " Oh , my goodness , Captain Boomer , how do you go up and down this monstrous big river month after month ? Does n't it just scare the life out of you ? " Upon which he 'd roar out in laughter , giving them a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tell them no , he could run it " with both hands tied in a fog with a blizzard going , " which struck me as a peculiar combination . I 'd never seen a blizzard going in a fog , myself . But one noon when he 'd drunk three or four glasses of wine and told a dozen or so braggy " experiences , " he went up to the wheelhouse , with the usual kite-tail of ninnies , and the first thing he did was run the boat onto a sand bar . It was stuck as tight as a brick set in concrete , and the river falling . Well , neither the crew or the men passengers were overjoyed , because a number had to row out in boats carrying anchors to kedge us off , and it took a nation long while , as well as involving several styles of cussing . Most of the ladies took to their cabins ; it was too various for them . After this for awhile the Captain did n't blow so much but meeked down a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good thing , for I 'd noticed a husband or two looking ruffled , as if they did n't know quite what to do . About the only female he had n't any luck with was Lauriette , who blossomed out like a morning glory on this boat , with a gown cut so low you could practically see her knees . It was a disgrace , as I told her , but she said when a woman was " richly endowed she should n't hide her lights under a bushel . " Well , that ass of a Captain ventured to give her a friendly tweak as she leaned over the rail , and she straightened up with a peal of laughter , tossing aside her handkerchief , and fetched him a clout across the chops that rolled his eyes in their sockets like marbles . He reeled over the deck on rubber legs and kind of fell down a companionway to his cabin . " You 're a wonderful conversationalist , Captain , " she called after him , as if she did n't notice anything wrong . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little hard . After all , she 'd practically invited himp176to gouge her , by bouncing around so , and then she had to punish him . She was a bully . I tried to make up my mind which of them I could n't stand worse . The next day , I saw Captain Boomer lounging around near the texas , sporting a shiner , and offered him a pair of brass knucks I got in a pawn shop , to give him a fighting chance , in case she piled on him in earnest , but he turned them down , thankingme courteously . He 'd had all the wind taken out of him by that whack , and no wonder . It was vicious . This Lauriette may have looked soft and round , especially standing naked in the barn in the moonlight , but she was about as helpless as a crocodile . I 'd found that out when we were riding on the road . She could pound a saddle for hours without tiring ; she had my tongue hangingout before we 'd gone ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and hauled out his principal amusement , which was a cockfight . When I saw it , I was sorry I 'd offered him the brass knuckles , for he did n't deserve them , no matter how bad women beat him up . We found out that he always carried this kind of sport along , to round out the roistering and gambling in the saloon ( which , by the way , was over a hundred feet long  --  the principal room  --  on the Jacob Gruber ) . He had a combination friend and employee , a greasy fellow named Lopez , darker than the average Cuban , which had a collection of gamecocks . Well , on a ship this size somebody or other was always transportingdomestic fowl , and after the Captain had shamed and ridiculed the owner , they usually gave in and agreed to fight . On the occasion of our trip , a young farmer , red and worried ( because he 'd as much as been called a coward in front of a considerable group ) , picked out his brassiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space around the smoke pipes , forwardof the saloon and sheltered by the pilot deck , commonly used for baggage and open-air seats . Everybody with a strong stomach that could crowd in was there , and a number , flushed with drink , were betting large sums . Lopez and the farmer squatted down , holding the birds , andp177when that fool of a Captain shot off a gun , they gave them a ruffled shove out into the center . For a minute , they only circled around , wary and suspicious , but the gamecock had been trained to kill , and seeing an advantage it leaped forward and lit on that tame rooster all spraddled out . But Boomer and Lopez had a surprise coming ; the farmer 's bird very clearly preferred civil treatment from its companions , and said so , along with several rooster oaths ; then he kicked that gamecock about ten feet straight up . There was a hubbub from the gamblers , because it was mostly the professionals that lost , then somebody set up an outcry for a re-match , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was a decent enough fellow and likely would never have served his flock so , but he was in a tough position  --  so they sawed off both roosters ' spurs , put on gaffs , and , after the Cuban held his bird 's head in his mouth  --  to " revive " it  --  shoved them back again . In a twinkling both fighters were stabbed through the neck and lying bleeding on the deck . But the Cuban 's finally got back to its feet , wobbly and weak , and was declared the winner . There was no other way to judge it , for the farmer 's bird was stone-cold dead , sprawled down in a mess of blood and feathers . " Hoo-rah ! " the Captain cried , with an impudent stare at the farmer . " Now if you 've got anything better than that , trot ' em out , for you surely to God ai n't showed us much yet . " " I need the rest of my roosters for when I and my wife set up to farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defiant . " If a hen figures to lay , she needs a rooster . And I 've already lost my best worker . " " Why , you do n't mean that specimen laying there was apt to oil up a hen 's machinery , do you ? " Well , everybody like to split open , laughing , and said it was as powerful a joke as they 'd heard in a month of Sundays , and the Captain was so pleased he could hardly rest . It was the first real good one he 'd got off this trip , according to one of the gamblers . He said it all over again ; then he sent a deck hand down to roust out the first mate , so he could hear it , but he came up lookingp178pretty sour , being asleep , and then they pushed up around the farmer and commenced to make things warm . Poor hayseed , he had n't any idea how to handle this situation , with all these swells in fancy clothes , so he just grew redder and redder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How much do you ask for your fowl  --  all of them , my man ? " said Lauriette , walking coolly forward amongst that gang of dandified roughnecks . " I thank you , ma'am , but I did n't calculate to sell them . " " What do you want for your collection ? " she said , turning to the Cuban with a curl to her lips . " See here , Madam  --  " said the Captain , beginning to bluster in a cautious sort of way , but she cut him off short . " Name a price . " This Lopez scratched his head , and said , " These birds muy expensivo , " or words along that line . " In Cooba  --  " " Would fifty dollars put an end to this disgusting exhibition ? " " Si , Senorita , maybe . Muchas gracias . " And then , by golly , she unlaced her bodice and dug down into the bank again , causing a number of whistles and catcalls , shelled out the money , pointed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I trust these will repay you for the loss of your bird . " He could n't cough up a single word , but gulped several times and worked his Adam 's apple in appreciation , while the rest of the people muttered a protest , angry and baffled . It appeared certain there 'd be trouble , for they had hoped to see all the farmer'sroosters slaughtered and the man put out of business , so naturally they felt cheated . A piece of charity like this went against the grain . They were n't used to it . But there were good sports among them , because one fellow sang out , " Pshaw , I 'd give up a cockfight any time to see another treasure hunt like that . I 'm satisfied . " And after that , others chipped in . Somebody hit on the banking idea , as you might expect , and inquired if he could make a deposit . Well , when he said that , everybody broke up all over again , and then two or three of the ignoranter element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow wearing a high fur hat removed a pair of white cloth gloves , took out a long pig-hide purse , and declared that he 'd admire to become a stockholder . The whole atmosphere turned good-natured , if rowdy , and a well-dressed and dignified elderly man hit the keynote when he told Lauriette , " Little lady  --  I 've got the best supply of fighting birds on earth back home , and they 're all yours for a dollar , if you 'll kindly peel it off the bottom of the roll . Dig down  --  do . " Lauriette told him they were " coarse , " and he seemed surprised , trying to figure out what he 'd said , but the meeting broke up before he worked it out . There was n't any way to solve his puzzlement ; it was only the humor of the times and place ; these fellows were n't accustomed to any other kind . Still , I do n't think things were as bad as suggested in a newspaper article I saw soon afterward , in the Prescott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with but few exceptions , by a class of low-bred , ungentlemanly , and sometimes ruffianly vagabonds , who seldom , if ever , treat a person with as much respect as a well-bred hound deserves . " That may have been stretching it , the same as a U.S. Army Engineer did when he wrote , after some romantical stuff he read about pilots : " Most of the river pilots are possessed of but little knowledge beyond that required in turning a wheel . " As soon as everybody was gone , I went to the rail and dropped my brass knuckles overboard . I thought I owed the girl that much for being so disloyal about the Captain . She was a bossy creature , but she had some good points , too . The Jacob Gruber , being low-pressure , was slower than the other kind , and took longer from St. Louis to New Orleans , but it was by no means a bad run . The average time of high speed boats came to be about four days upstream , and three down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the river , between those two chief points , was nearly 1,400 miles long , with all its twists and turns  --  some of them doubling back so that a body traveled due north at times  --  and that the old flatboaters required 120 days to pole up , after a float down.  |p180The  Gruber usually made its downstream run in five days , more or less , but on this trip we hit so many sandbars the schedulegot joggled . The Captain being a show-off was always taking the wheel from the pilot 's cub . And the farther we fell behind , the oftener he tackled short-cuts  --  across " chutes , " or places where the river had sliced through on itself  --  and the more unchartedchutes he tried , the frequenter he bulled into the sand . He hit a snag , too , and knocked several buckets off one wheel . Finally , in a burst of self-confidence , to show what he really could do when pressed , he ran us onto the rocks . Just above Natchez . This was serious , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sandbars never damaged a Mississippi paddleboatunless a captain tried to knock one out of the water whilep181racing ( which activity caused most of the accidents ) , but rocks would kill a ship in record time . Well , when we hit this particular shelf , barely covered by water , we got out by using our spurs , which were crutches  --  big long poles or planks , like stilts  --  that they stuck down on the bottom near the bow . Sometimes they lowered one , sometimes two , depending on the size of the boat and how bad she was jammed . Once the spurs went down , a tackle was rigged from the tops to rings on deck , and then , with everybody cheering , they hauled on a windlass and lifted the bow clean out of the water . The second she was up , all steam cracked on and those paddlewheelschurned up a fury . Customarily the boat waltzed right on over ; after which the spurs slipped from their place and she was free . And if a person could n't throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They patched her up in a jiffy . The truth is , these Mississippi steamboats were treated reckless . For all their buttery shelf-paper look and brassy gewgaws , they cost very little , so Lauriette said , and if one got wrecked , it long ago had paid itself out . The machinery and furniture could usuallybe saved . She said in the case of the old New Orleans , half its cost of $40,000 was earned back the very first year . In another case , where a boat was built on a ridiculous piece of high ground , with an Evans engine installed , the river fell for six solid months and they never did get it floated  --  rotted away so bad there was n't money enough to repair it . So what was done ? Why , they took out the engine and set up a saw mill on shore . And did a whacking good business , too . That engine was said to chew up three thousand feet of boards every twelve hours . As the Captain stated , it was a superior kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more river than a forty-foot cove , where he 'd tied up a skiff , for fishing , and he no longer had to operate at night , because the mosquitoes ashore were too pesky . Once he got used to his steamboatrunning all the time in air , and filled up with sawdust , he would n't have swapped places with a commodore . The Gruber had so many frills , with that monster saloon , two orchestras , gambling , a barrel of whiskey always tapped on thep182boiler deck for the crew  --  to be drunk whenever they pleased  --  filagree work everywhere , and deep Wilton carpets , that I could n't help wondering what she charged for passage , so I hinted around with Lauriette till I found out . That double stateroom cost sixtyfivedollars . Up-river fares were just double what down-river passagecost , because it took longer and they had to burn more wood , stopping at country landings where wood ranks were kept filled and ready , with wood at $2.50 a cord . Cotton cost two dollars a bale to haul from Memphis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deck passage , which meant a pinched little hole under the boiler battery or dining saloon among the mules back aft , and a regular punching up at midnight by the mud-clerk , along with fighting and thievery from roustabouts that talked practically pure African , cost from three to six dollars , according to what humor the steamboat people were in when you bargained . Taken all around , it was worth a little less . A person traveling deck passage on these boats got next to no show . He was looked on as down and out , with little chance to elevate himself up . The ship officers tried to be fair , though , and if somebody cut his throat while roughhousing , they sewed him into a brand new canvas  --  nothing ragged or brown-stained the way canvas gets pretty quick on river boats  --  and slid him overboardwith weights on his feet . Oftentimes , they even gave him a prayer , as proper as church , if a preacher could be located on board that was n't drunk . On the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaten or mauled ( and his possessions stole ) , one of the mates conducted a search among the hands , all aboveboard and proper , and told them right out and positive that they ought to quit doing that sort of thing so much . It was distractingto the life of the ship , and annoyed the Captain . Good roustabouts that really worked were hard to keep , with the whiskeybarrel going all the time , and the officers did n't care to offend them more than necessary . Nobody ever got any stolen stuff back , of course , because if a roustabout delivered up an article , it was probably something the mate could use himself . The roustabouts understood it , and admired him for it.  |p183We  ARRIVED IN New Orleans early in the morning of August 7 . Neither of us had been there before , but almost all of Lauriette'sfamily had , and stayed at an elegant hotel where they lorded it mighty high , but she steered us away from that so we would n't be traced . Leaving our luggage at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong sunlight , past the wharves , from Canal Street to Julia , piled high with square white bales of cotton . Then we had a look at the packets tied up two and three abreast at the Girod Street landings . Farther along , from Julia to St. Louis , there were dozens and dozens of boats that made shorter trips  --  to the Red River , the Black River , the Ouachita , the Alchafalaya , the Tensas , and to Bayou Lafourche and Bayou Sara . These were being loaded or unloaded with cane , cotton and tobacco mostly , and a clackety bustle every place you looked . Some of the streets were just watered , and things smelled good : fish and strong coffee and fruit for sale . Flowers were everywhere , in the window boxes of the houses , too , and negroes were singing whilst sweeping out before places of business . It was strange and excitingenough , I reckon , but it was pretty Frenchified , for me . As we progressed farther , some amazing stinks came out of little restaurants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only French cooking  --  getting soups and things like snails and frogs and barnacles going for lunch , you know  --  but I didn'tp184entirely take to it . I 'd heard before , at home , that Frenchmen ate snails ' legs and frogs , but I never believed it until that morning we walked along the New Orleans streets . It was n't ten o'clock yet , but a good many men were sitting at outdoor tables , fully dressed from high hat on down , drinking odd-colored liquids from very fancy-wrought glasses . And one fellow that I judged got tired of sitting , because he was under the table instead  --  was asleep with his head on a crossbar . The proprietor had removed his hat and left it in a chair , obliging and polite , to show that the table was occupied , along with the space beneath , but it would n't have done a person any good to sit there , for no place was left for his feet , unless you put them on the man in the basement 's chest . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair sprinklingof darkish sleepy-eyed ladies , dressed in the gayest kind of clothes , uncommon bright for this time of day , so I concluded that they were going to a party . A number of other ladies were leaning over balconies above , with very little on in their case , and as friendly as you could wish . One or two even asked me up to visit , laughing and showing their pearly teeth . Lauriette called them Creoles and said they were no better than they ought to be , but I did n't know anybody that was  --  the statement made no sense  --  so I smiled to quite a few and bowed as they pointed me out , until she gave my arm a wrench that halfway pulled it out of the socket . She was about as unsociable a person as ever lived . The nicer people acted to us , the stiffer she became . There was n't any way to get along with her . Lauriette said we should find a hotel room , then have the other hotels in town canvassed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd told her what I figured happened about my disappearance , and said they likely considered me lost . If so , they would travel on , and might have pushed ahead to Cayo Hueso by now . We had to find out if we could , and do what seemed best . " Look here , " I said to the girl . " Are you dead set on running away from home ? This Cayo Hueso 's a long way off , and it may n't even be safe . You 've transported me down here , and Ip185thank you for it , but this might be the place for you to stop and turn back . " " Not on your life ! " she snapped . " Nothing could make me , ever . This is the first time I 've ever truly been alive in my life . " Well , it was also the first time I 'd ever heard her speak out so passionate and unfrolicsome , too . So I shrugged and knuckled under . I 'd got to put up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was better to do it with a good face . We got a room big enough for five people in a sleepy hotel with a wide upstairs porch all around and folded green shutters with the paint peeling off . It was what she called shabby but genteel , " and it wo n't be apt to bring us to anybody 's attention . " Then she summoned the desk clerk , a young man of about twenty-four , totally bald , wearing an eye shade and garters on his sleeves ; had him come up to us . One thing this frisky female got from Belle Mead was a kind of royal attitude that everybody was born to serve her . She may have differed from that family in some respects , and been better , but she was as high-handed as a duchess . The fellow slouched up the stairs and knocked on our door , and by George if her manner did n't cause him to remove the eyeshade . And him the boss of the establishment . " You sent for me , Ma'am ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance . " " Yes , Ma'am , that 's what he said , and said he was off to the steamboat company to get your bags . We ai n't got only the one porter , and Mr. Aller 'll be knocking the place up for rum at 11:30 . He ca n't  --  " " Never mind about that , " said Lauriette . " This comes first . I 'd like to hire somebody to check all the hotels in the city . We 're looking for friends . " The young man squinted , then batted his eyes , as if his brain was too paralyzed to comprehend it . " I do n't know  --  I just do n't know who it would be . I had a boy around here once with sense enough to run errands , but he went off on a steamboat . Then there 's my brother , but  --  "  | " Get me somebody in about an hour , if you please , " said Lauriette , and handed him five dollars . " He 'll be well paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bill over and over , looking at it . Likely it was as much as he made in a week . " It 's for you . Now the day 's warm , and my brother " ( brother , now , was it ? ) " and I want a bath . Instruct your errand boy to knock before he comes in . " " But I already told you , Ma'am . He 's gone off on a steamboat . To the best of my knowledge , he 'd be in Louisville around this time . It 'd be downright awkward to  --  " " See here , " said Lauriette in about as rude a question as I ever heard , " are you altogether bright ? " " It 's been claimed I ai n't , " said the young man with a keen look . " Sometimes I get the keys mixed up . You take last week and I accidentally sent a traveling man up to a room where there was a widder woman waiting for a boat to South America . When they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figured to catch old Merry Ned , but  --  " " Bright or dull , your tongue clacks . Good-day to you , " said Lauriette , half closing the door . " Find me somebody competent to search the hotels  --  preferably not a relative . Get somebody from outside . If you understand his speech , look further . Get a person who makes no sense to you , and he 'll serve very well . " Well , I never ran across such a wiseacre . You 'd a thought she was the Queen of the Zulu Islands , she was so uppity . I was embarrassed , and said so . " Clodhoppers ! Half-wits ! It 's enough to strain the patience of a saint . " " If you do n't mind my mentioning it , " I said , " most people strain your patience by breathing . Another thing is , how much money do you have to toss around in that style ? It 's ridiculous to be handing over five dollars to every Tom , Dick and Harry that 'll consent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half-hobble on your tongue , and give them seventy-five cents ? You could save up a very respectable amount in a year 's time . " " Money ! What do I care for money ? "  | " Nothing , I can see that plain enough . But I do . I was n't raised this way . I could have bought a billygoat with that five dollars . " " Well , that 's just what I did , " she said with a brilliant but superiorsmile , and went off to take a bath . The man they got turned out to be tolerably smart , but he reported back that Uncle Jim was n't anywhere to be found , nor was Dr. Snodgrass and the others . So there was nothing for it except push on . We sent the canvasserto the steamship offices , particularly the ones going south , but they had no recollection of anybody resembling Uncle Jim  --  they were too busy to try  --  and we decided that , after all of our troubles , he might have signed the passenger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Our best chance was Cayo Hueso , or Key West , as people here called it , but all the boats going out for the next month had their cabins sold out , and Lauriette declined to sleep on deck with the roustabouts . She could get fastidity at very annoysome times . In the end , we worked out a tedious sort of passage , in several stages , to a place named Tampa , set back in a bay on the west coast of Florida , and the following Monday we checked out and turned up at the wharf for the trip . The steamship bunch said we could probably catch a boat  --  Cuban or some such  --  from Tampa to Key West , meaning one time or another . They acted as though we would n't mind laying over for a year or two . I never saw people with so little regard for haste . They closed up their offices at noon , for instance , and lolled around , sleeping or drinking and smoking , until late in the afternoon . Neither did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apt to be around eleven , which would give them a full and comfortable stomach for the nap to follow . The only people you saw of early morningswere the ones that had n't gone to bed yet . Mostly , nobody went to bed in this city . It did n't agree with them . They lived at night , and lived hard . Nearly everybody had a brownish tint to their skin . At first I thought it was the strong sun , but their color was too sallow for that , and even bordered on the unhealthy . Lauriette laid it to ap188mixture of races from the countries lying below , but we came to find out it was coffee . A Mr. Bradford in the hotel got tooken down sick , and they rushed a doctor up to him fast . The clerk told us about it , after a few preliminary insults from Lauriette to remind him who had the upper hand . The victim had shut himself in for the weekend , with some work to do  --  and kept the porter trotting up with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapsed , and they called the doctor when somebodynoticed that his bed sheets had turned brown . It could have been yellow janders , but they were always worried about the plague in these tropical places , and never knew what form it might take . But the doctor said he had sweated the sheets brown . They came to find out he 'd drunk upwards of thirty quarts of coffee in three days , and it was coming out of his pores . By good luck , the weather was just that sultry , otherwise the man would have died of acute coffee-itis , so they said . The doctor saved him , by emptying him out and putting him on a diet of rum , but it was a very close call . The trip we got outlined by the U.S. Mail Company would have to be broken into several pieces , as I said , but it turned out even worse than we hoped . First off , we got aboard a rusty old tub called the Star of Baton Rouge , do n't ask me why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was different from traveling down the Mississippi , as I found out pretty quick . In the morning , we got up and had to side-pedal along the deck to breakfast in the saloon . I figured there was something wrong in the construction of the ship because it refused to stay anything like level . You 'd a thought you were on a teeter-totter , but it was n't as pleasant as that , for after a sizable teeter , you expectedthe same kind of totter and it did n't come . The thing held up a few seconds , and when it did rise , a body 's stomach rose with it . The deck kept sliding off , so that you had to keep your wits about you to stay upright . And then , when we got sat down ( and I thought it was uncommonodd that practically no other passengers showed up ) , a stew/and wearing a frilly white jacket brought in a very nice breakfastof mutton chops , catfish , fried potatoes , ham , creamed beef , fried eggs , bacon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , apple pie , and coffee , and I did n't feel so good . But I dislikedto be un-mannered , so I decided to try and stick it out . After all , they 'd tried to serve up a nice light breakfast that would make everybody comfortable , and I was n't aiming to strike a bad note if I could help it . I knew what the trouble was well enough  --  a woman in the hotel had given me a peach , the day before , and it had probably gone bad ; it had soft spots in it . Well , I took a hitch at the mutton , which seemed chewier than usual . In fact , the more I chewed it the bigger it got , while the fountains in my mouth worked overtime . Then I tackled the beef , which appeared to unloosen my stomach from its moorings , and after that a man sitting alongside me , wearing a hat and muffler to keep the sea air off his " quinzy throat , " as he said , summoned the steward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tasty , ai n't it ? " said the steward , a skinny white man with a bad tremble to his hands , and flicked his napkin with a beautifulflourish that squashed a fly which had settled down on the ham , but regretted it . " You carrying sheep on this trip  --  live sheep ? " " Well , no . I would n't say that . I could n't say it , because it would n't be true . The answer , not to be misled , is  --  No . " " To take it a step further , ai n't this sheep-dip that you 've substitutedfor coffee by mistake ? " The steward inspected it , with a kind of mock-worried look , and said , " Why , no  --  I would have swore  --  "  --  he tasted it  --  " Yes , I 'm right , and I knew I was . It 's coffee . The sheep-dip 's kept in another place . " " Then what in the blistering Hades is wrong with it ? " " It 's full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to drink it . I 've got more respect for my stomick . " " What kind of a blue-bellied boar would take and serve it tous ? "  |p190I  would have stayed for the answer , because it happened to be something I wanted to hear , but I broke one of my eggs open just then , and it reminded me that I 'd better get out on deck . It came over me all of a sudden . Afterwards , they told me I was seasick , and put me in a chair exactly in the center of the ship , so it would rock up and down but I would n't , and presently I felt some better . But not good enough to go back in that saloon . When we got to Mobile , we had tickets on a stage line for a place called Pensacola , in the north of Florida . We could have taken a train except that the Florida Alabama Railroad , which ran from Pensacola to the Florida-Alabama line before the War of Succession , was n't any longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Railroad would n't be started for another year yet , they said . So we got into a rickety stage , along with a Yankee that claimed he was going into the drug business , a very pretty woman with a kind of powdery , baked-on face who somebody said was shooed out of Mobile , he did n't say why , and two or three others . It was a jangly , hot , sweaty trip , with several stops at dingy little inns , and we never got rolling for any period of time , because we always hit a rut and some of the luggage fell off . The Yankee finally blew up and asked the driver , " By God , why do n't you get down to brass tacks and tie it on ? " " I foller the manager 's orders , and I ai n't been ordered to , " said the driver , who was chewing tobacco all over his chin . " I do n't get paid hardly more'n enough to hold body and soul together , so I 'd be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " There was n't anything to be done , so we went on , but everybody'ssuitcases were smashed up before we got there , and the Yankee allowed he was planning to sue . The driver was all for it , and said he would testify for him , if the company gave him a day off for it . I never could tell if he was joking or not . He had another of those frozen faces ; practically nothing he said came out quite sensible . What 's more , his assistant , a smelly old fellow with a gray-streaked beard , doubled over with laughter every time he opened his mouth . Lauriette said they both needed ap191thrashing and that if we had anybody but a Yankee along , they 'd get one . The Yankee heard her , but he failed to respond . In Pensacola we got passage of a mean sort on a schooner that was hauling immigrants to Cedar Key , about half-way down the Florida west coast . A lot of these boats , jammed full , were leaving because a rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these new arrivals were northerners who had heard about the Florida west coast from Yankee soldiers and sailors that were sent there on raiding expeditions during the war . The climate was so balmy they tooted it up all over the country . Lauriette said Florida was having a " boom , " which sounded to me like it had exploded , but anyway a whole fleet of schoonersand sloops was sailing down that coast , stopping at this white beach or that for people to settle . Some , from the East , were traveling to Tampa by the new railroad from Fernandina to Gainesville , then down from there on a stagecoach . A man named Moses Levy , who owned thirty-thousand acres and eighty-one slaves near Cedar Key , had the idea of turning his place into a monster resort for " oppressed European members of his faith , " and one of the things he did was get some people interested in starting the Florida Railroad , which aimed to run from Fernandina , on Florida 's upper east coast to Tampa . Well , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name to David Yulee ( for business reasons , as they said ) , instead ran the railroad right over through Gainesville to Cedar Key , where he owned all that land . Moses neglected to go on to the promised land , which was Tampa , somebody told us . Tampa was left holding the bag . The citizens down there felt kind of sore , particularlybecause the state had guaranteed the interest on Yulee 's bonds and he was granted big tracts of land for it , free . So they got together and burned him in " effigy , " which was n't as satisfactoryas the real thing , of course , but would have to do until he made himself available . Afterward , they must have forgot about it , because this Yulee , or Levy , was elected the first U.S. Senator from Florida . Hep192never did get the oppressed peoples over , though , and a numberof Tampa residents came out flat-footed and said it was a very good thing . But these were the ones still grumbling about the railroad . Most everybody 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've noticed . Along with the Yankee immigrants were poor southern families fleeing away from their homes because of carpetbagger rule . Many of their towns now were run by darkies of the worst breed , and nobody liked it . This southern bunch traveled mainly in covered wagons , drawn by oxen or mules , and made only a few miles a day along the sandy trails . Part of the migration was an aftergrowth of what they called the Homestead Act , which was passed by Congress in 1862 . The Federal Government , confound its hide , owned a lot of land in central and southern Florida , and when the war ended these tracts became open to occupation . Each settler was entitled to 160 acres of land if he built a home  --  a lean-to would do  --  and swore to till the land for five years . When all was said and done , this free land was maybe the chief thing that drew the new immigrantsdown , along with the climate and the bossy negroes that I mentioned . Neither of us favored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it came on to blow , and there was n't a dry stick on this shabby little vessel . When the wind hit its worst , we lost a spar from the top rigging , and it came down and struck a Cuban man that had something to do with cattle on the head . They stretched him out on deck , and one of the passengers , who had meant to become a doctor but failed then decided to become a farmer instead , bled him considerable into a jar . The man had been breathing quiet and easy before that , in spite of the wound , but when he lost all that blood , he died in short order . The farmer claimed he would have died anyhow , but there was some criticismsabout it . Lauriette got off her usual sass , which did n't help any , andp193certainly failed to bring the man back to life , for they slid him overboard with a piece of chain tied to his feet , whilst the Captainread a beautiful service , in Spanish , which somebody thought might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because  it 's no slouch of a job to dig up something in that language right off , so in the end , they took it off a crate . But Lauriette got sore about this , too . She said it was a disgrace , and had n't anything to do with burial , but was only , " Arriba , siempre de pie ; cuidado mojarse , " which meant , " Keep this end up and store in a dry place . " When we got off at Cedar Key , worn out with all that tossing around in high seas ( it had practically been one of those end of the summer hurricanes ) , we ran into the old business of waiting . A Captain James McKay , who ran the U.S. Mail Line , had regularboats going from Cedar Key to Tampa , but there was n't any passage for a week or more . Lauriette blew up , of course , and threatened to buy the line and throw Captain McKay out , but the agent laughed in her face . This McKay had a reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole business of shipping cattle to Cuba , in the late 1850 's , and encountered the usual trouble with Havana grafters . The agent said there was n't an honest man in Cuba , and from what I saw later , I reckon it was nearly true . Anyhow , early in the game , McKay let the Havana officials know where he stood , because after they tried to squeeze him for bribes , he invited them to ride on his ship Magnolia , took them out to a patch of water that thrashed and swirled with sharks , and tossed them all overboard . When they climbed back , a little gnawed here and there , they never mentioned grafting again . This bunch was cured . That had been before the war , of course . Now , ten years later , the Cuban cattle business was going great guns . The revolution against the Spaniards had started , and the rebels controlled most of the cattle in Cuba , so the Spanish came over to Florida after beef for their soldiers stationed there . For every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubloon , worth $15.60 in American gold , and for each one shipped to Havana , half again that much , also in gold . So ( to get back on the track ) Lauriette had to give up her windy threats against Captain McKay and look elsewhere . The only other course was to take Yulee 's railroad to Gainesville , out of the way , and proceed down from there to Tampa by the stagecoach . It was the only time I 'd been on a train except once when my Aunt Effie went to Memphis after her store teeth . I was glad it worked out this way ; it was interesting . Old Yulee ( who they called " the father of Florida railroads " ) had built this line before the war , or about 1853 , and it stood up pretty good , with a few drawbacks . For one thing , it was bumpy . They said the track was 5-foot gauge and had 58-pound iron " Chair " rail , which was imported from England . The first locomotive , the " Abner McGhee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody ever told me why . The train we got on  --  one coach and a baggage car  --  was drawn by a locomotive named the " Governor Marvin . " All of the locomotives on the line had names , and were so referred to , as if they were people . It was confusing . We were standing at the station when an employee wearing a uniform took out a watch the size of a gourd , and said , " Governor Marvin ought to be pulling in any minute , now . " I was happy to hear it , because I 'd never seen a Governor , and wondered how tall he was and whether he had a silk hat on , but the employee blew the whole thing up a minute later , by saying , " He 'll likely need his wheels oiled , and if he ai n't got a hot box , I miss my guess . Further , we 'd better make ready to scrape the cattle bones off his cowcatcher . " I realized perfectly well I had n't been around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool me into believing that anybody would deliberately squirt oil on a Governor , and I did n't think he wore a cowcatcher , either . But when I mentioned it to Lauriette , she only gave me a withering look and said , " Are n't you a funny child ? " The route led us through scrub pines and oaks and palmetto ,  |p195as  wild a land as you 'd hope to see , and somebody pointed out three rattlesnakes sunning themselves in a gully . We had two regular stops before Gainesville  --  one at Sumner and another at Venables , but as it turned out , we stopped several times . Lauriette said people generally resented progress , no matter what kind , and it was so in this case . The backwoodsmen claimed the turpentine operations opened up by the road ruined their hog business , and they were hopping mad . So we were chugging along through the scrub , five miles out of Sumner , when all of a sudden there came a grinding crash , the seats flipped forward , the wheels slid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a-hissing . I heard the sound of somebody cussing up ahead  --  the engineer , or fireman  --  and we stuck our heads out of the window . Directly in our path , a big pile of charred ties had been stacked up on the rails  --  crisscrossed one over the other to a height of six feet or more . We could n't got through it without runninga chance of busting our headlight . Well , the engineer and firemen climbed down , along with most of the passengers . Two or three men wearing linen coats threw them off , and we started laying aside the ties . From over to one side under the trees , though , somebody yelled , " Enjoying yourselves , boys ? Hot , ai n't it ? It do n't do to tromple things up so a man cai n't raise his hogs . It 's mean . " " Why do n't you swill peddlers crawl out of that skunk cabbageand show yourselves like men ? " the engineer roared . He was about six feet four and must have weighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat . " You 're going to get in trouble for this sort of thing  --  you wait and see . " A perfect riot of laughter went up under the trees , and after that a rifle shot cracked out , clear and sharp . The bullet struck the engine , pinged off the iron , and went singing like a bee into the bushes . We scrambled back aboard the train , and as it moved forward , nudging the remainder of the ties slowly out of the way , the engineerlet them have one last blast , with just his nose showing above the window sill of the cab : " I know you  --  you damnedp197trouble-making Turners , and do n't think the Sheriff wo n't hear about this . " All he drew forth was another rifle shot , fired up in the air , I reckoned , and some more yells of laughter . If you 'd asked me , we came out second best , but this was n't all . By no means . Twenty miles farther on , at a place where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten or eleven times on his whistle , and we stuck our heads out again . It was women this time , about eight of them , all wearing sunbonnets . One was driving a mule hitched to a cart that had stopped just across the tracks . They stood in the way of the train , and declined to move . Down we climbed again , the engineer swabbing his neck with a bandana and looking played out . He did n't mind fighting men , I judged , but this was one too many . " Well , Mrs. Perkins , " he said to the ringleader , a sharpfeaturedold battle-axe clutching a hoe , as if she intended to use it . " What is it ? Same old thing ? " " Eight outright broken , nigh onto a dozen cracked , and the remainder likely scrambled in their shells . " " I informed the company ; I told you that last time . In addition , I advised you to pack them in sawdust . And if my memory serves me right , I suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he do n't throttle down for the crossing . " " Mules do n't grow on trees , John Kelly , " she said , and raised a kind of grumbly laugh of agreement from her sisterhood . " Well , they 've been having some mighty smart success with grafting , Ma'am , " said one of our passengers , a waggish little fellow with very deep-set eyes . " It may be they 'll have a tree producing by this time next year . " She said , " Fresh ! " and twitched her hoe . " Now Partheney Perkins , " said the engineer , " you 've halted my train here for the umpteenth time , and I 'll thank you to get off the tracks . " " There ai n't a single one of us fixing to budge till you 've didp198something about my eggs  --  we 've took an oath on it , and do n't mean to break it . " " Well , what in thunderation do you think I can do ? I 'm not in the egg business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passenger , looking very seriousand concerned , " I think she 's requesting you to lay some more . Over there near that hummock is a good place for a nest . Under the conditions , it would n't be any hardship for I and the other passengers to go back to the coach and wait . Cackle when you 've finished . " " You 'd better get that whipper-snapper out of my way , " said Mrs. Perkins , " else I 'll part his hair with this sod-buster . We 're bent on action , and it 'll take more'n bandies from an end man in a minstrel show to stop us . " " Yes , yes , " said Mr. Kelly , " he was only being facetious . Now these folks want to get on up to Gainesville , so I 'm afraid  --  " " We 're afraid you 'll have to grade up the crossing to smooth out the bumps or they 'll be here till Doomsday . " Mr. Kelly sighed ; then swiped off his neck again , and after that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went to work on the road . In about an hour , they had the dirt pushed up level with the rails , so there would n't be any bumps , but he said : " It 'll wash down again with the first rain . You know that well enough , Partheny . It 's nothing but work wasted . " " To say nothing of eggs wasted . " Mr. Kelly made some kind of remark that indicated he was near about through with the railroad business , and we resumed on . Half a mile up the line we hit a cow . It was purely an accident , in no way the engineer 's fault . We were smoking around a bend , with our view cut off , and the bony animal jumped out of the bushes in our path . It was dead by the time we stopped , and when we climbed out , two raggedy boys were there , staring at the cow , shy but ruffled . " Paw 'll take it to court , " said one of them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder if we ever fi'ourld get to Gainesville , because I figured the engineer was about to walk off the job into the scrub and let the whole thing slide . He 'd had enough . " Oh , he 'll sue , all right . He 's got thirteen suits pending at the moment , including around nine for cows that were snake-bit . " One of the boys whispered in the other 's ear ; then he picked up a rock , sent it sizzling by the engineer 's head , and they dove into the bushes like deer . The engineer made no answer but only wrote down about the cow in a notebook , and we started up once more . This time we made it without further interruptions and had good luck in addition , for we got right onto a stagecoach headed for Tampa . It was full , but the people were nice and pleasant , and the trip was interesting . The roads were so rough one lady got seasick , but they took her behind a tree , where she unloaded her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her some seasick remedy and she picked up . We had an entertainment all the way because of the driver 's " gopher grabbing . " None of the passengers had ever seen anything like it . Without slowing down , he 'd leap from the seat like an acrobat , snatch up a gopher ( which were all over everywhere , and not prairie gophers at all , but ordinary land turtles ) then toss it up onto the baggage rack overhead . These animals were worth twenty-five cents a piece ; they were fat and tasty , so people said , and darkies were crazy about them . It had got to be a regular fad in the cities . The driver told us he usually made more from gopher-grabbing than he did off his salary , and better , it kept him exercised and healthy . He looked fine , but wore down a little toward the end of the trip , which took two days and a night . More particular , he was limping and said he 'd wrenched his right knee , which was the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a section of his spine , but nothing serious . People complained that the Gainesville-Tampa stage was slow , but it was a wizard compared to the freight-express operatingp200from Tampa to Barstow , as we afterward learned . For this , they used lumbering broad-wheeled tarpaulin-covered wagons drawn by three and four yoke of oxen , that were driven by hearty war veterans which used black-snake whips so accurate they could pick flies off the lead yoke . The express took two full days to travel the forty-two miles . We got to Tampa just in time for it to cease existing . On the day the stage rolled in , there was n't any such city  --  a very curious situation , as I 'll explain by and by.  |p201Key  West Aug. 28 , 1869Dear Ladies : WE ARE ARRIVED at our destination , the target of our dreams and aspirations . In this line ( as one looks about ) it may fall a few inches short of Elysium , as I do not believe that ever in the course of my eventful medical career have I beheld a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tumultuous , sweltering , wind-blown and yet exotic and many-faceted isle . Physically , it is less than imposing , being four miles long and two miles wide , being , indeed , often referred to even by its own residents as " The Rock . " I am further informed that Ponce de Leon , in his voyages of 1513 , spied this out-flung bracelet of coral sands , or " Keys , " and named them " Los Martires " ( the Martyrs ) , out of melancholia produced by a pervading sense of loneliness and foreboding . But more of these descriptive pearls anon . In this my second epistletory report to you ( on behalf of Colonel Burnie ) I must first tell you , regretfully , that your nephew has not to date been located . To resume where I left off in my inaugural message , the Colonelwent ashore to institute a search , and he told me , later in New Orleans , that both banks of the river were combed back to ap202distance of one hundred miles . Nothing of value was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised when it was learned that a series of petty thefts had plagued the countryside during the week past . This was unfortunately resolved with the apprehensionof a carpet-bagger who ( as it were ) was hauled up on the carpet of justice , then put in the bag ( or gaol ) for some months to come . A second , excellent lead fizzled when Colonel Burnie investigateda constable 's report of a slingshot raid on a hothouse . You may well imagine the high zest , the certainty of reconciliation , with which the Colonel rushed to the hoosegow in question . Fully prepared to embrace our missing David , his spirit was deflated to find that the culprit was a half-wit child who had escaped from a neighboring orphanage . Other hopes were dashed . A farmer with an account of systematicallyvanishing chickens finally ( and courageously , in view of his wild accusations against neighbors ) laid the blame squarely at the door of a weasel . A desecrated schoolhouse proved to be the work of its principal , whose nervous breakdown ( his ninth ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ailment is occupational and not , at this stage , certifiable . The discovery of two squalling cats hanging over a clotheslinewith their tails tied together was not given much importance ; it is a favorite amusement with every boy in the town . In short , nothing anywhere had been seen of a lovable towheadedvagrant youth , with an expression of suppressed mischief . In spite of these setbacks , we are in uniform agreement that the boy will , in fact , turn up . It is more than possible that he has struck inland , where the citizenry , removed from the educative river traffic , are more vulnerable to those nocturnal forays which lie so close to the wanderer 's heart . Together with my daughter Millie ( who remains fragile ) and the negro quack , Zebediah , I continued on my way to New Orleans , the only notable part of the journey being a serious case of larceny , involving our companion of color , who was separatedp203from a pouch containing the upper left incisor of a pregnant female lynx , a severed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bull 's horn , a peacock feather , a white button with four holes , a dried mullen top , seven orange pips , and a section of vertebra from a deceased albino rabbit . As our friend claimed that these curiosities , in the aggregate , rendered him immune from misfortune , I registered a spirited protest with the Captain , getting nowhere . ( I must in fairness confess to a certain skepticism myself , since the victim 's recent life , in transit , has been little more than a fabric of disaster , but he hotly demurred . ) Upon my pressing the case , with suggestions of litigation , the Captain grudgingly consented to appraise the inventory , at the going market rates , in company with his officers . Their price ( arrived at late in the evening ) of thirteen cents struck me as parsimonious , but nothing could be done . There the matter rests . I greatly fear that deck passage must be undertaken withfull acceptance of the hazards involved . We debarked at New Orleans and repaired to the hotel designatedby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the servants of hotel guests . Our week of waiting for Colonel Burnie was pleasant though dull for a physician who has , I believe , displayed unusually quick mobility for a professional man . Hence you may not view it as strange when , to while away the time ( and to strike a blow against infection ) , I slipped briefly back into harness . To be specific , noting that a good segment of the New Orleanspopulation sported an unwholesome , sepia-colored , liverish complexion , and finding that our hotel had a tap running freely with really excellent water ( that is , discovering that all the ingredientof my most famous specific were available ) I took steps to sacrifice my time to the public weal . The spot I chose in which to 4ke  --  Ey9i i- hang out my shingle was at the corner of Bourbon and Charles streets , where the above mentioned jaundiced condition seemed more acute than elsewhere . I commenced . p  --  bet les- treatments atp204about five in the afternoon , when the sufferers had arisen from a heavy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the evening , thus being in a maximum state of receptivity . Well , with the limited aid of my daughter , whose excess of femininity will only just permit her to wham out a hearty trombone ( and no more ) , I made a good start toward putting this deterioratedcity back on its feet . Three men emerged from a saloon were dosed with Liquid Vermifuge and restored to the gutter a surprising percentage of those poisons which had brought them to their low estate . A gaudily-dressed woman carrying a parasol , swallowed , reeled , spat out a stream like a fire-hose , then emitted a hideous string of crisp , sailorly oaths , and ankled off down the street with greatly improved celerity . Thus , in a word , my practice was booming with its usual satisfying effects when I was rudely interrupted by the arrival of two constables and a representative of the local medical group . This last was a man with one foot in the grave , as I saw at a glance , and the constablesoozed jaundice at every pore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my credentials . Always genial , I told them I had never carried a sheepskin , as I 'd never had occasion to skin a sheep , but they disregarded the jest . Upshot of the affair  --  an indignity virtually unparalleled in my experience  --  was that my daughter and I were confined to our hotel room , like common criminals , until the arrival of Colonel Burnie , who straightened out the matter with a sprinkling of judiciously placed bribes . If I have a moral to this story , it is this : The corruption and sharp practice of New Orleans are beyond the beliefs of honorable men , and will doubtless retard the city 's growth . Indeed , it would not surprise the undersigned if the metropolis is eventually abandoned , as being too much of a handfulfor any practical use . Now , with the arrival of your brother , alone , we mournfully prepared for the last leg of our journey to Key West , which was accomplished via the thousand-ton steamer Galveston , having had a passage cancelled on the Matagorda  --  both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monthly betweenp205Texas ports and Key West , Havana , and the North . The Galveston , on its trip up , was carrying a cargo of Texas ponies for the Florida ranges . Our run was comfortable and without incident . Loaded for the journey down with a variety of staples having a connection with the sponge and cigar industries in Key West , besides a quantity of dress goods , millinery , pottery and kitchenware , we arrived after a smooth passage and lodged in a hostelry of lacy frame construction , run by a Cuban who promptly attempted to enlist us in a political club dedicated to the liberation of his native land . Even more urgent , he pressed us for a " donationto the cause . " I was glad to be able to respond promptly , and I did . I promised him that , as soon as we had become settled , I would prepare a batch of my greatly lauded Essence of Spooju ( a specific for everything ) which he could ship to the beleaguered rebels with my blessing . Your brother 's suggestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished to strike a real blow for Cuba , was ignored by the undersigned with that detached hauteur of which I have become a master during long years of a peculiarly difficult pioneering practice . Colonel Burnie has an eccentric sense of humor . Cubans have flocked into Key West in vast numbers this year , we are told . Taking their place beside such American manufacturersas William H. Wall ( who founded the cigar business here in 1831 ) , they are establishing factories that should bring a high measure of prosperity to this southernmost little-known part of our republic . Perhaps the most prominent of this group is Vincente Marlines Thor , who is in process of moving his El Principe de Gales plant here from seething and uncertain Havana . As to the revolution , it is everywhere in the air of Key West , which in truth is as much Cuban as American in tone . Many political clubs are already in existence , and several news journals are printed in Spanish . Unquestionably , the largest sums to this worthy movement are being donated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been afflicted by the fervor . I understand that the local Collector of Customs may be removed from office because he has contributed $100 . There isp206talk of filibustering expeditions , to originate here , and it is knownthat three ships  --  Dauntless , Monarch and Three Friends  --  havecome in and out of our harbor under cover of night , bound on God knows what furtive missions . While resting here , and waiting for Colonel Burnie to formulateour plans for the new life to come , I have possessed myself of all available historical documents concerning this strange region , and have studied them thoroughly , an enterprise in which I have been joined by my daughter , Millicent , against that joyous day ( which will arrive , as stated ) when the prodigal child returnsfor a resumption of his tutelage . May I say , aside , ladies , that any close inspection of history can only fill the reader with dolor over the ' incomparable follies of the human race . As to Key West , it is a sad commentary , to begin with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventurer whose principal motive was to find a basin of wash-water whereby he could restore the vigor of his youth . ( In modesty , I must add that this discovery was not to be made for another 350 years , when a humble physician , whose name is not unfamiliar to you , would produce his now famous Swamp Elixir , with feats of rejuvenation scientifically described in nearly every magistrate 's records of the Mississippi valley . ) The local scholars inform me , over the tiny cups of penny Cuban coffee  --  imbibed in the coffee houses as the principal social function of the area  --  that the first evidences of habitation hereabouts date from around 1700 , when the Caloosa Indians ( now disappeared ) were driven southward from the mainland by numerically superior tribes from the north . The English helped complete their annihilation after Florida came into English hands , in 1763 . Most were killed ; some fled to Havana , where the sturdy , fighting blood now mingles with that of the Cubans . I am certain that no part of our young nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this single Key . Ponce de Leon 's voyage claimed Florida for Spain , naming it for the Feast of Flowers , the Spanish phrase for Easter ; then the Treaty ofp207Paris , in 1763 , ceded it to England in exchange for Havana , which , to mix a metaphor , must certainly rank as one of the poorest samples of horse-trading in the annals of Spanish real estate . " Cayo Hueso "  --  Isle of Bones  --  arises from the assaults on the Caloosas , for the coral was apparently strewn with the skeletonsof those luckless red men . William P. Whitehead , an early settler here , writes in 1829 : " It is probable that , from the time of the first visit of Ponce de Leon until the cession of the Floridas to the United States , the islands or keys . . . were only resorted to by the aborigines of the country , the piratical crews with which the neighboring seas were infested , and fishermen . . . . The oldest settler in this part of the country , one whose residence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1775 , used to say , that in his early years ( around the commencement of the eighteenth century ) the Indians inhabiting the islands along the coast and those on the mainland were of different tribes , and as the islanders frequently visited the mainland for the purpose of hunting , a feud arose between the two tribes , and those from the mainland having made an irruption into the islands , their inhabitants were driven from island to island until they reached Key West . Here , as they could flee no farther , they were compelled to risk a final battle , which resulted in the almost entire extermination of the islanders . " This sanguinary battle strewed the island with bones , as it is probable the conquerors tarried not to commit the bodies of the dead to the ground , hence the name of the island , Cayo Hueso , which the English , with the same facility which enabled them to transform the name of the wine Xeres Saco into Sherry Sack , ' corrupted into Key West . " And an archeologist who lately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupation are found on Key West as wellas on some of the neighboring keys  --  stone walls , remains ofearthworks and the like , with indications that the island was wellknown to the pirates who frequented these waters during thep208Eighteenth Century and had not wholly disappeared when Florida passed into possession of the United States . " Well , to sum up , as these excursions into the past may distract your interest from the personal account of your family and friends , our British cousins ( twice removed  --  by force ) ceded Florida back to the Spanish in 1783 , and shortly thereafter Cayo Hueso was presented out of hand to one Juan Pallo Salas , a young officer , by Don Juan de Estrada , the Governor of Florida . It is presumed that the handsome gratuity was in return for military services rendered , no doubt having been suitably bloodthirsty and cruel , in line with the Spanish custom of the period . Salas , an enterprising fellow , sorely in need of cash , sold his Key twice simultaneously , once to a John Simonton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a Mr. Strong , who wisely and quickly resold to a Mr. John Geddes . There followed a lively lawsuit , which was resolved when the over-zealous Salas gave Geddes a schooner and four acres of East Florida land ( neither , by coincidence , owned by anybody else at the moment ) to pacify the Simonton interests . Spain sold Florida lock , stock and mangrove to the United States in 1815 , and in 1822 Commodore David Porter arrived with a naval squadron to rid the adjacent seas of pirates , who were believed slightly to outnumber the fish in these waters . Porter 's accomplishments , which doubtless are known to two maiden ladies of culture , were in the finest tradition of American energy and patriotism . After bottling the pirates up at the Isle of Pines ( near Cuba ) he attacked them with damaging results , then hounded them to their end in Porto Rico . We pause now for one of those typically depressing footnotes to American history . Spain , which had villainously protected the pirates in their profitablework , lodged a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our State Department , and Porter , who had made the mistake of pressing a war to its victoriousconclusion , was court-martialed and suspended for six months . As our leading commodore hero ( and by far our ablest sailor )  |p209he  was obliged to seek employment with the Mexican Navy . Later , having given that dubious body its sea-legs , he transferred to the Turkish Navy . No doubt his name will some day regain the luster which was stripped from it by our ever-timorous , weakkneed , altogether mealy-mouthed and all-around embarrassing and incompetent Department of State . In another dispatch , I shall mention the mixture of population which comprise our chosen abode . Indeed , Colonel Burnie has requested me to communicate our day-to-day adventures , with sidelights on their historical background , as a means of keeping a running journal on this emigration of note . Our arrival here has occasioned no little interest . While it may be over-fulsome to describe us , currently , as distinguished residents , there are yet points of identity which set us apart from the commonalty of Key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Confederate officer here with eleven high decorations for bravery and twenty-two officialreprimands . My daughter Millicent is beyond question the only female trombonist on the island with qualifications approachingthe virtuoso level . The quack , Zebediah , is the Key 's acknowledgedexpert on Southern Kentucky medico-superstition ( all of it ludicrous ) and the undersigned will strike , when the time is ripe , with a series of those miracle cures which have made my name a householdeath word from Minneapolis to Grand Isle ( below New Orleans ) . All that is needed is an epidemic of some mild sort  --  cholera , yellow fever , bubonic plague  --  and my position will be secured . If it is n't , we can always move north a Key or two  --  out of range  --  they string out toward Florida 's **28;2471;TOOLONG a bejeweled arc of 150 miles . In that last regard , Colonel Burnie informs me , in strict private , that he holds a treasure map , gained from the Mexican War , which has as its locale a Key called Matecumbe , in approximately the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall eventually settle , and live from the fruits of buried gold . The prospect is entrancing . On that note , I close , with every expression of sympathy andp210regard . Let us trust that when next I write , our party shall have been reinforced , so to speak , with the arrival of your no doubt itinerant , but highly esteemed , nephew . Obediently , Dr. Ewing T. Snodgrass ( Resident Physician , Casa Lopez , Key West , Florida ) P.S. I should add that Colonel Burnie has just read the above composition and expressed himself as satisfied- with the general quality of my reporting ; saying , in fact ( and I repeat this in no spirit of braggadocio ) , " If the present tone of candor expands , this material may take its place beside the papers of Villon , De Quincy , Casanova and other leading rascals of literature . " E.T.S. ( D.C. , etc. )  |p211OUR  STAGE pulled into Tampa ( with a record catch of gophers ) soon after the city had gone out of business , same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was this : After the war , a whole bunch of wandering , rampaging , freed or long-ago runaway negroes came swarming in , and began to parade their new " equality . " This was n't the general behavior of all darkies , you understand , but a lot of them did cause trouble . As one visiting writer said , they " swaggered through the streets , often pushing white men and women from the sidewalks . They refused work but they needed money for whiskey . They got it by breaking into stores and homes , often in broad daylight . " And the Tampa Peninsular said , " Our families can not even go to church without leaving someone at home lest on our return we find our places robbed . " Well , the mess had to be cleaned up , of course , so a city governmentgot going again , having been allowed to die out during the war . And what happened ? Why , what usually does , according to Lauriette . The officials disremembered they 'd been elected by the people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the universe . They put the darky trouble down all right , by electing a sheriff and holding courts , but then they went crazy on the subject of taxes . I once heard my Uncle Jim say that taxes had caused half of the world 's woes since time began . He said people generally for/got they had the power to tax or untax themselves , by turning up at elections , but mostly nobody bothered to fight . " They just settle dully into the notion that their government is something apart from themselves , higher and bigger , and full of punishments and threats , rather than a poor charity body they can yank up whenever they choose . " So Uncle Jim put it . In this case , on top of everything else , the officials decided to whack out a crusher of a real estate tax . For once , the people got up on their hind legs , as they 're forced to do everywhere , I reckon , and voted those officials out of business . Instead , they elected a slate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , and put things in the record : "  --  as the City of Tampa has forfeited its charter , all property of this city shall be taken over by the county clerk . " Well , did n't those tax-crazy officials feel like fools ? They slunk around town , or , rather , that part of Florida , hardly looking anybody in the eye , even their old friends of the happy , pre-tax days , when they all lived together in Tampa . Not only had they taxed themselves out of a situation but they 'd served their city so well that it disappeared , like Pompeii in the history books . Uncle Jim said later it represented a low-water mark for government officials , which was already so low they had it staked out somewhere three or four foot below the mud level . Even so , we were n't inconvenienced any . There was n't any Tampa , but the houses still stood where the city used to be , and the streets had n't been took up . Things were just the same , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by . One of the odd things about the Tampa Peninsular , as we found out when Lauriette read some back copies , was that the advertising was mostly for Georgia lotteries . One , in 1860 , for example , had been " an attractive sweep , " with a capital prize of $60,000 , in the interests of the Monticello Academy . There was n't any question that Tampa had been , and maybe still was , a rackety place . A story in the Peninsular said : " To say that our city was infested with gamblers , No. 1 black/legs , burglars , thieves , robbers and cutthroats of every shade and high and low degree is but speaking the simple truth . One morninga man , a noted villain , was found swinging to a pine tree . A few were whipped . Others were warned and got their orders to leave . The effect was electrical . Robberies ceased . Gamblers fled . " Anyhow , we rode on in , and after some inquiries put up at the residence of a Mrs. Hawkins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a Mr. Samuel Craft ran a Private School for Boys , nearby . But on the way , right in the center of town at the corner of Washington and Franklin streets , we ran into an odd commotion . A man dressed like a politician , in a frock coat and high hat , was lying there drunk , and a number of people were helping him out by pouring molasses and corn over him . I do n't believe I ever saw anything quite so peculiar . Well , once they 'd got him covered  --  and they did a bang-up good job , too , ladling that stuff out freely in a period of hard times and high prices  --  the pigs waltzed in and added their bit . For a minute , I thought they might eat him alive , for these were half-wild swamp hogs that had n't been penned up often . Rooting and squealing and shoving and squirming to get at that fodder , they tore all his clothes off , leaving him lying there naked and filthy , still passed out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this went farther than a low practical joke . We came to find out that the man , a Mr. Bagley , was a black Republican , born in Georgia , who 'd turned coat after the war and got appointed county judge . But his actions were so offensive he made enemies of everybody , and whenever they complained , he charged them with contempt . In the end , he got himself inpeached by the State Legislature , but before it happened , a prominent citizen walked into his court and fired off a blast at him with a shotgun . Somebody remarked that this was about the last word in contempt , and it might have earned the shooter a citation later at the Pearly Gates , exceptp214that a court clerk struck the barrel upwards at the last minute . Bagley did n't wait to issue any papers ; he snatched up his hat and rattled out of there . One of his main weaknesses was drinking , though , and he always went the whole way and got drunk , commonly picking out a prominent place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any trouble keeping his name before the public that way , and they always gave him a hand , to be sure he was noticed , by pouring on molasses and such . We hung around awhile , Lauriette not bothering to cover her eyes , the way the other ladies did when his clothes shredded off , but staring along , perfectly brazen , and when the crowd trickled away , leaving him exactly as he was , we checked into Mrs. Hawkins ' . It was a highly respectable establishment , not much given to nonsense , and I had the notion that if we 'd got out of line , the proprietor might have poured molasses and corn over us ; she was that straight-laced . But we were lucky to lodge there ; it was n't usually a boarding house , so we tried to enjoy it . The same Captain McKay whose boats we could n't get on had several ships going on the Havana cattle run just now , and we booked passage to Key West via the Southern Star for the following week . Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very lively on the ship and on the stagecoach , not to mention the Florida Railroad , when we were on the floor more than we were on the seats , because of all those sudden stops . Also , and I dislike to say it , we were kind of fed up with gophering . It made things jerkier than necessary , even on a stagecoach . Daytimes we walked about what used to be Tampa . There was n't as much of it as in former years , Mrs. Hawkins said . The city itself had been losing population since about 1860 , the cause being the ending of the railroad at Cedar Key , along with epidemicsof malaria and dengue , or breakbone , fever , and sometimes the dreaded yellow fever , too . During these sieges , the people fled out of Tampa into the woods or to nearby communities , and some never returned . The town had a population ofp215885 white folks in 1860 , but ten years later , there were a hundred less than that . When the war started , Union sympathizers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Key or Key West , and a lot of men that joined the Confederate Army never came back . And then , after the war ended , the rampaging negroes caused a lot of families to move where the trouble was controlled . This Tampa never treated darkies bad ; it just did n't like being run over roughshod . We saw an example of how they naturally felt , as we walked about , from a tombstone that was put up under what Lauriette called " delicate conditions . " A very old prominent citizen named William Ashley died , and shortly after , a youngish colored woman who 'd been his servant died , too . But she was somewhat more than his servant , as they said , so that the executor of Ashley 's estate , with everybody 's hearty approval , buried the master and the darky in a common grave . Then they had the tombstone maker inscribe on the stone : " Here lie William Ashley and Nancy Ashley , master and servant ; faithful to each other in that relation in life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be wise  --  in the grave all human distinctions of race or color mingle together in one commondust . " Somebody said they planned to keep that tombstone in good repair to kingdom come , for both the man and the woman were respected , and treated so . It 'll be standing a hundred years from now , very likely . Though Tampa itself was dwindling in population , while HillsboroughCounty increased , the times could have been worse . A number of stores were doing fairly good business , we noticed , including the drug store of Dr. Franklin Branch , which was the only shop that stayed open during the war . Practically nobody had either " hard money " or Yankee greenbacksbut dealt with the stores , and each other , by barter , the main goods for exchange being cotton , hides , beeswax , honey , tallow , sugar cane , molasses , corn , tobacco and rice ( and lately , gophers ) . Things had trickled down thin in 1867 , when the schoonerp216James E. Price , carrying supplies for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called it a " great calamity " and said that " many families are out of food . We hope our merchants will remedy the situation by chartering a schooner and dispatchingher as soon as possible or else much suffering will inevitably result . " The crisis slid past , and nobody starved . Uncle Jim once said he never heard of anybody starving to death in this country , so he failed to understand why people worried so much . He himself did n't bother , but I doubt if anything short of the sky falling would have worried him ; he was n't made that way . And right there 's where his statement went wrong . Some people are born to worry ; they ca n't help it . If there was n't anything else handy , they would worry because they 'd run out of reasons . Now I see I 've dawdled again , and must get on with our story . Things began to happen pretty fast , as you 'll learn very soon . It was two days before we were to take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late in the nice soft twilight of a miserable hot day , were walking home to Mrs. Hawkins ' . We had been to see the Hooker mansion , where an Englishman who 'd come to Tampa to organize a music academy and run the town band wrote a ballad called " When You and I Were Young , Maggie . " It had caught on , do n't ask me why , because it was about as gloomy a piece of merchandise as you could hope to hear , and people were singing it , mooning about the past , and so on . It was ridiculous . We heard a girl of no more than sixteen sing it at a church recital , with the tears running down her face , and if she 'd been much younger , as she was braying for in the song , they 'd a had to put a nipple in her mouth and change her diapers . No , that song may be all right for some , and worth all the ruckus they made , but I 'd like to bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much boo-hooing , and no more . Anyhow , as we approached home , a man stepped out of thep217shadows , tipped his hat , and handed us a note . Then he scuttled away without opening his mouth ; neither did I get a good look at him . We went inside , turned up our lamp , and read it . " Oh , my , " cried Lauriette , looking pale and sitting down suddenly . " Well , what 's it say ? You need n't hog it yourself , you know , " and I snatched it out of her hand , but after I read it , I did n't feel quite so perky . Confound it , there was n't any way to get rid of them . " My darling sister Laury " ( it went , with that kind of family sarcasm I knew so cussed well by now ) : " Did you really think you could manage it ? Wherever you are , my emissaries have found you . The most ignorant and brutish of our local Ku Klux @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luckily inexhaustible funds . You may be uplifted to know that within twenty-four hours after your companion broke my leg ( the crowbar was found , with some of my flesh attached ) I had begun the hunt which will see Burnie 's nephew in a very early grave and fetch you back to Belle Mead . You will live here year by year , rotting and withering ; as the head of the family , I tell you so . " I feel that life cheated me , and I ca n't allow it to play favorites with the ones who bore , reared , and shaped me . Of that , I assure you who never bothered to conceal your distaste for the despised epileptic . There  --  the word is out for all to see . We never had the courage to put a name to it , did we ? Our splendid father , whose pride was worth more than a possible cure for his son , preferred to shut the unfortunate away and run no chance of embarrassment . And do you know , my cold-hearted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have been indiscretions of my male parent that gave me this unfashionable affliction . It sounds harsh , does it not ? " No matter . My men have instructions to track you down , erase my attacker by the most painful means they can devise , and drag you home . They have no orders about your treatment en route . Perhaps in their coarse way they may take a fancy to you.  |p218For  those who like full-blown girls with your peculiar sort of colorless hair , you may not be unattractive . Or so I have been told . " Enjoy yourself , my dear . For when the walls of our beloved mausoleum close in upon you , you shall resign from the world for good . " As to your companion , it will be my lasting regret that I shall miss watching his punishment . Perhaps when my leg is healed ( and I am informed that I shall always walk with a limp ) I can settle the rest of the account  --  with his uncle . I hope so . For now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are under scrutiny by the best , and worst , of human bloodhounds ; your avenues of escapeare cut off . The knowledge of this , when I receive it by return mail , will ease my convalescence . " Your ever-vigilant , black-sheep brother , Rex " " P.S. The antedeluvian darky , Uncle ' Ned , has been rewarded for his loose tongue and meddlesome ways . His funeral was conducted , with appropriate ceremony for such a quaint and protractedfixture of the neighborhood , only the day before yester-day . " The letter disturbed me for several reasons ; it was n't entirely one-sided . And Lauriette went to the window and stood looking out for a long time . " The odd thing is , " she said , " I never thought of him as a personbefore . He was always something ugly and hateful . It 's true  --  we shut him away . " Then she turned around with the old look of decision . " However , the time is long past when anything can be done for that fellow . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full-fledged scoundrel , and we 'll fight him right down to the end . " " We ! " I said . " How can a wea  --  " I almost said " weak , " but the word refused to budge . " How can a girl , no matter how bull/headed , and a boy of fourteen hope to beat that bunch of pole-cats ? " " Well , we 've beaten them so far  --  to be truthful , I 've enjoyed it  --  and we 'll go right ahead . I 'm sure you wo n't be crushed to know that I never met a male yet I could n't out-guess . " " It may be irregular to suggest it , " I said , " but why do n't we ankle out of here to the police ? Tomorrow , in broad daylight . It 's what they get paid for , you know . If you feel so all-fired eager to lambaste people , maybe you can get on some police force your-self  --  later . " " What police ? Tampa 's out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd forgot it . " Then how about the county sheriff ? It might give him something to do . You take usually , they only sit around playing pinochle , or collecting up donations , or thrashing darkies . They get bored . " " See here , my charming young smarty ; are you anxious to be mutilated and killed by a gang of common Ku Kluxers ? " " Not even by somebody socially prominent . Neither am I convinced that you can whip the United States Navy , along with Jeb Stuart 's cavalry , the Texas Rangers and the Canadian Mounted Police . You 're tough and you 're mean , but you 're not that good . " She gave me a slap that made my ears ring , then burst into tears . Maybe some people can tell what a woman 's apt to do next , but I 'm not one of them . " Now what was that for ? I was trying to pay you a compliment . I meant it . Pound for pound , I think you 're more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in the Army , but  --  " By George , she slapped me again . With the other hand this time . She could change off as easy as eating . It gave me a fresh outlook on her , and determined me to stay back out of firing range . " It 's what I get for trying to take you to your uncle , for living in barns , sleeping in haystacks , eating filthy food bought in hor/rible little country stores , and traveling in cheap public conveyanceslike a peasant . I should have known . " Well , there was something in that , and I felt sorry , and said so ; said , " I was only funning , Lauriette , maybe because I 'm scared . You have been good , and I thank you . " I tried to smooth down her hair , but it was up a little above me , and awkward , so she put her arms around me and gave me a tight hug . I did n't mind it . She was too soft in places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she smelled good , and while I could n't stand females , I disliked to hurt her feelings by breaking away , so I let her hang on for a minute . She was n't being entirely honest , of course , because one of her reasons for leaving was to escape Belle Mead , but the girl had courage , and I 'd come to like her better . " All right , " she said , pushing me away and taking out a handkerchief . " That 's enough nonsense for now . We 've got to move fast tomorrow , so let 's go to bed . " She blew out the lamp and went behind her screen . " No matter what  --  " Just as she said it , there came a tinkle of glass , and a rock thumped down on the floor . She gave a cry , and I scrambled after it on hands and knees . We struck a sulphur match , then unwound the paper . All it said was , " Pleasant dreams little lady we 'll tuck you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been watching from under the shade all the time . " That 's enough ! " said Lauriette , standing in the dark . As usual , she had n't bothered to put on a stitch while we were striking the match . She had as much modesty as a monkey in a zoo . " We 'll see about this tomorrow . I 've got a few ideas on the subject , so lock the door and window , and let 's get some sleep . " " Excuse me , " I said , " but part of the window glass is knocked out , so why  --  " " I said lock them . And now , good night . " She was up bright and early , with a familiar tilt to her chin , and rousted me out as cool as you please.  | " I 've thought it over . We 'll tell the whole story to Mrs. Hawkins . She seems both intelligent and sympathetic . " I did n't bother to argue , but for my taste this Mrs. Hawkins looked about as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had all the earmarks of a typical schoolteacher , the sort that might split hairs over whether Cape Horn was at the top of Africa or South America . I 'd run across her kind before . But to do the old girl credit , she listened without interrupting once , and when we finished she sent a girl to fetch her friend , Reverend Muckleroy . " Henry will advise us , " she said . " He may give the appearance of the mild , befuddled man of God , but he 's as hard as iron , underneath . " Well , that was recommendation enough for me . If this sharpfeaturedold war horse considered him tough , he probably ate a boiled grizzly for breakfast and got his exercise pulling up oak trees by the roots . But when he arrived , he struck the most laughable picture of toughness I ever saw . He was partially bald , with a pince-nez on , had watery blue eyes , a stringy neck , a dreamy , far-away expressionwith a half smile to it , very rumpled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lauriette seemed impatient , almost angry . " Henry , " said Mrs. Hawkins , " this lovely young girl , Miss Lauriette Farrow , of Belle Mead Plantation , at Vicksburg , and the boy , David Burnie , of Grassy , in Kentucky , are being pursued by the Ku Klux Klan , which intends to do them a mischief . They ca n't leave Tampa on James McKay 's ship , for these dreadful men will apprehend them . But they must escape , and get to Key West . What do you suggest ? " " What 's that , my dear ? " said Reverend Muckleroy , rousing himself with a start . Well , you may not believe it , but instead of cracking him over the head with a ruler , Mrs. Hawkins repeated all that over , together with most of what Lauriette had told her . During the lastp222part , Reverend Muckleroy appeared to have drifted off to sleep again . " Now , " said Mrs. Hawkins , " tell us what to do . Do n't pretend to be wool-gathering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , they must engage Seminoles to take them south through the Everglades and the land of Grassy Waters . There is no other transportation in that region . They 'll want mosquito lotion , of course  --  the rainy season 's coming on  --  and I need hardly say that the Indians expect to be paid . Do you have money , Miss Farrow ? " he asked , looking at Lauriette with about the directest gaze you ever saw . We could n't help it ; we both burst out laughing , in pure relief . " I have plenty of money , Reverend . How shall I make arrange-ments ? " He looked surprised , hurt , even . " Arrangements ? Why , I 'll make all the arrangements , of course . You are n't to worry about it any further . " He hesitated . " There is one thing  --  it involves a certain amount of risk . Our Seminole " ( he pronounced it Semin-olay ) " brothers have concluded a peace , but they are not , ah , over-cordial . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not emphasize that too strongly . " " Could it be worse than having the boy killed and myself taken prisoner to be done with as they like ? " " No , ah , well , you see  --  I thought of that . Yes , it went into my considerations before I spoke . " He got up and fumbled around for his hat , that he 'd been sitting on , and said , " And now I must take myself off . In carrying out the Lord 's work , there 's a great deal to be done , a very great deal indeed . " He put the hat on , a mighty sorry-looking sight , which did n't seem to bother him , then headed for the cloak closet . But when he got inside , a number of things fell down with a noisy clatter , and he came back out again , puzzled . He said , " Dear me , " and took a fresh start toward the door , and this time he made it . He appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that that doddering , mixed-up old laundry bag had been a frontier scout , an Indian fighter , a chaplain inp223the Confederate Army ( decorated over and over ) and that , in spite of all the Seminoles he had killed in his youth , he remained a good friend of several clans . They respected him , and believed what he said . In the next two days , Lauriette herself was not wholly idle . The first thing she did , which surprised me , was to prance right down to the post office ( at noon , so as to be safe ) and mail her brother'sletter to a judge in Vicksburg . He was a man the family had been friendly with before they withdrew from society , and he had influence . She put in a long letter of explanation , and blew the whole works sky-high , or aimed to . Believe me , she told the entire story : epilepsy , leprosy , the substitution of brothers , Ku Klux Klan , the beating of Zeb and me , Uncle Ned  --  everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mead was straightened out . She went so far as to admit it might be better if her uncle took over . Her brothers could get proper treatment , and the people could quit living lies . Well , the next thing she did , on advice of Reverend Muckleroy ( via Mrs. Hawkins ) , was to change her reservation at the steamshipcompany . Instead of having passage now to Key West , we were headed toward New Orleans . It seemed a smart dodge but not the sort of thing a preacher might dream up . He was as tricky as a fox . Three more days ran by without another note or any further word from the Reverend , and then , one evening , we got word to make ready . Mrs. Hawkins knocked on our door , and said , " I have instructions from Henry . He says it 's important that you carry them out explicitly . " Then she sat down on the edge of the bed , looking faint , and added , " Oh , dear , I hope we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl to be thrown among red savages on a long , wild trip . It frightens me . " She was a good soul , but she should have saved her pity for the Seminoles . I 'd traveled a considerable while with this young and beautiful girl , and knew her habits . The next morning , we were told to pack a few things and leavep224them in the house while we took our mid-day walk . And when we came back , they were gone . This addled-looking preacher intended to shake us out of Tampa without any chance of being followed , and he came within an ace of doing it . The day after that , when we were about to venture into town , Mrs. Hawkins came to our room for the last directions . " Gather up your small toilet articles , and any other little personal belongings . You are not to carry anything that might indicateyou are leaving . This is your last walk . Go slowly and aimlesslyto the bandstand . You will see Henry there . Do not speak to him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave us each a hug , sniffled a little , and dabbed at her nose with a cambric handkerchief . When we left , she whispered from behind the door , " Go as if it were another morning walk . Henry feels that they are n't watching these daytime outings by now , but you are n't to take chances . Now , then , you 're gone . God bless you . . . write me some day and tell me you passed safely through this frightful ordeal . "  |p225W  WALKED ON down the street , with Lauriette holding her head high and defiant , as though she could whip the Seminoles with one hand and the Ku Klux Klan with the other . We ambled about town , taking care to stay in the busy parts , and finally wound up at the bandstand . Reverend Muckleroy , somewhat more rumpled than usual , was standing there eating goober peas out of a sack . He had a dimmish , far-away look to his eyes . We kept on walking around the park area , circling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly . Lauriette , of course , had to demonstrate that nobody could tell her entirely what to do , so every time we passed him , she " harrumphed , " in a coughing sort of way . Nobody else was in sight , anywhere . On our third trip around , Reverend Muckleroy said , without turning toward us : " Very good . Now continue your stroll down to the Bay . Directly in front of the U.S. Mail Line Pier , you will encounter an Indian with cropped ears . He is my friend , and your friend . Do exactly what he says . He will guide you south through the Big Cypress Swamp and to the land of Grassy Waters . After that , he will make arrangements . I wish you good luck , my children . " I felt a sort of lump in my throat for this preacher ; he was the first one of his kind I 'd ever liked , and even Lauriette , who thought that the whole human race was born to serve her , whispered , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved , but continued to munch on goober peas , as vague and bewildered a specimen as possible , and said , " It 's part of the Lord 's work . Moreover , you 'll be expected to pay . But Crop-eared Charlie is an honest friend of his white brothers . All will go well . You have my constant prayers . " So we were off . At the steamboat docks , a squat , darkish man of middle age , dressed in a cloth Indian costume of bright colors in a zigzagging pattern , stepped out from behind a crate and said " Come  --  please not to look behind . " We followed after him down the piers and along a shell beach to a cove where a cluster of mangroves hid a long dugout canoe  --  a pirogue , hollowed by burning and scraping out of cypress wood . As we learned more of Florida , in the days and weeks and months to come , we found out about these things . Cypress is a kind of evergreen , without much foliage except air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wholly separate , gaining their fodder from the atmosphere . The trees grow standing in water , and never rot , even if they 're cut . You can take a cypress log and stick it in the water , fresh or salt , and it will do nothing but gather barnacles or slime for the next hundred years . So you see , it makes a very good kind of wood for some boats . Crop-eared Charlie had this canoe there , with five other Indians , a perfectly silent and fat and shiny group , as much black as red , in gaudy clothes and no more smile to them than there is to a ham , waiting . There was one more , a fellow that checked in five minutes after us , to see we were n't followed . He was wrong , but it did n't look that way at the time . Charlie spoke English , or thought he did . He was carrying a big pack , aside from our clothes , that he said Reverend Muckleroyhad put together , and turned it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I do recall two large pieces of oil cloth ( which came in handy soon enough on that choppy Bay ) ; rubber hats ; two mosquito nets ; soap in a copper box ; rubber surgical plaster ; two big hunks of chewing tobacco ( which we thought very queer ) ; castor oil , which caused Lauriette to sniff in disgust ; ap228medicine case with cholera mixture , quinine pills , carbolized sinew for sewing wounds , and colorynth pills ; a pocket surgical case and thermometer ; a small bag with scissors , needles , thread and buttons ; a pocket compass in case we got separated from the guides , I reckon ; a small whiskey flask ; veils for our hats ; two lead pencils ; a small fishing bag containing one heavy trolling line , one light trolling line , sinkers , hooks , one large spoon , one small spoon , and six flies . Besides this , there was a pouch with a watch in a waterproof casing ; some cookery including knives , forks , and spoons ( because the Seminoles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; coffee ; sarsaparilla in tablet form ( if things got dull and we needed a toot ) ; some condensed cola-nut preparation , which a number of South Americans employed to hoist up their spirits ; chewing gum with cola-nut ; and an 1840 map of East Florida ( the whole Peninsula part ) which had been done by two army officers on orders from the U.S. Senate . I noticed it had a dotted trail eastwardfrom near a place on the Gulf named Sanybel across the Pay-Hai-O-Kee , or Everglades , to north of Fort Dallas , on the Mi-am-i , or Big Ocean Water . It said : " Passage for Small Boats as Reported by the Indians . " Well , it seemed like an odd assortment , but it came in handy , or part of it did . When the last man had pulled in , and grunted something to Charlie , he said , " You get in now  --  not look back . Is better than feel goodbye . " You take that all around , and it was about the best advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said no more goodbyes than an Indian does . It saves wear and tear on the nerves . Now I have n't an exact idea what our route was in heading out of Tampa , but I know that we carried the canoe several times , and several times camped on the banks of dark , spooky-looking rivers , a-splash with large fish and draped over with Spanish moss from the oaks on both sides . But I 'll try to trace it as near as I can . One of the worst features of the ordeal , from start to finish , was Lauriette 's high-handedp229manner toward the Indians . You might have thought she had bought them outright , and I told her so , the second or third time we pulled into shore for a rest . " See here , " I said , drawing her aside , " you 'd better ease up on this Cleopatra and the slaves business . We are n't at Belle Mead , you know . " " Oh , pooh , I 'm paying for this expedition , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Why , they have n't addressed a word to you so far . They have n't even looked at you . " " That 's what I mean . Except for that fellow with the chewed-up ears , they do n't act like servants . They need to be put in their place . " " Well , they are n't servants , " I said hotly . " They 're guides , and you 'd better get that through your pretty skull . What 's more , Miss Smarty , you 're walking on thin ice . These Seminoles may have quit fighting ten years ago , but they never signed a peace treaty , so watch out . " Well , sir , on one of the early stops , two guides had a confab to one side , then made a lot of jabber with Charlie , who came over sort of apologetic and said , " Mistippee wish part of pay now , say white man break promises all times . " " How much ? " asked Lauriette with a contemptuous look . " Muck-el-roy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunerd now . " Lauriette shrugged , then dug down into her bank , which caused the trouble-makers to rumble , or what passed for laughing , then one of them tried to dig his hand down , too . She gave him a very good sound whack on the cheek , and the others sitting on the ground practically rolled over on their heads . But Charlie looked unhappy about it . He smoothed things over , and we pushed on . To go back , we shot out of our Tampa cove and struck out on a downward , or southerly , slant across the Bay , past the mouth of the Manatee River , then along the coast in shelter behind one slender , white key after another . On the first hitch , a stiffish gale blew , and the Bay was rough ,  |p230as  it generally is , they said . Spray was flying around some , and Charlie covered us up with the oilskins and rubber hats . When the wind lay from the right quarter , they rigged a legof-muttonsail , putting a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sliding off , and we zoomed along . Later , we learned that , using sails and paddling when becalmed , these Seminoleshad been known to venture as far as Havana , from places like Cape Sable and the mouth of the Shark River , below the Ten Thousand Islands . Our guides paid no notice to the weather , but paddled on while one bailed in the stern with a cocoanut shell . We made good time ; it was a fast boat , and the high , curved prow of these pirogues threw the worst spray water aside , leavingus tolerably dry . Indians always make rough-water boats like that , while white people go right ahead turning out flat-bottom skiffs that get you soaked in the mildest breeze . I never understoodit , and never will . Down the coast during open stretches between keys when the Gulf rolled , we laid up , or carried the canoe if the distance was short to protected water . The first night , we pulled in behind something called ( on the map ) Long Island , and made camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to really examine these fellows . They were sturdy and strong , though running a little to fat , and , as Lauriettesaid , " impassive . " That is , they seldom changed expression , and they never used gestures . The truth is that they hardly spoke at all , something not confined only to our bunch , but was true of the whole tribe . These men had on costumes that would have blinded a weakeyedperson in strong sunlight . The main part was a knee-length tunic of loose woven cloth , for coolness , that had bright patches of color sewed on just everywhere . There were bands that went around in stripes , braids , strips tacked on here and there , and what was called geometric designs sprucing up the lower part . It was gaudy . At the middle , they were tucked in by a beaded belt or cloth sash . Underneath , they wore beaded buckskin trousers and mocca/sins . But this was n't all . Generally , they had two or three bandanasaround the neck , and a cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plumes of feathers sticking out in a graceful curve to one side ; not straight up or falling forward , the way you see them in pictures of the Western Indians . Altogether , you might call these Seminoles handsomely dressed ; I had to give them that much . But when we studied the women folk , a while later , the men looked downright drab by comparison . There was another side to this foppery , though . Besides being absolutely blank unfriendly , they smelled like billygoats . It was n't for lack of washing , either , for commonly they peeled off and bathed in the river or Gulf after a day 's run . They used a mosquito shooer of rancid fat  --  rubbed it all over  --  and I have to admit it made sense . That first night , Lauriette and I rubbed on the mosquito stuff Reverend Muckleroy gave us , besides tucking in beneath our nets , and the word went out like a flash . The mosquitoes relayed it right along : a bunch of fools had arrived with some very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It was awesome . A mosquito would sniff , take a few practice loops , get up a full head of steam , then tilt over like a pelican after a fish and come sailing right through the net . I never saw anything like it in the mosquito line . Lauriette was boiling mad ; she called Reverend Muckleroy a halfwit and said he 'd put in the wrong bottle by mistake . She said this lotion was mosquito-nip , and could attract customers from as far as ten miles away . " Why not try the Indians ' remedy ? " I said . " They are n't troubledwith mosquitoes . I have n't seen a mosquito near them . You take the average mosquito , and he 'd pack up his family and move to Cuba before he 'd be inconvenienced by their stuff very long . " " Not in a million years . I 'd rather be chewed to pieces than lower myself to the same class . What 's more , you are n't to use it , either , not if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards left . "  |p232She  was unusually small-minded that way . Now I 'd once owned a goat , before it ate an umbrella handle and died , and it got mighty ripe now and then , so I was used to the air being a little blue . History does n't tell anything to do about a Seminole smell ; it would have seemed to me politer to ignore it . It is n't genteel to go around sniffing at people and hollering " Pew ! " But that 's what she did . I might say that Charlie once told me , when she was off in the woods , that the Seminoles did n't care for her smell , either ; but that was all right because she figured hers was correct and theirs wrong . It was one of her typical jackass viewpoints . Anyhow , we made camp that first night behind Long Island  --  and even Lauriette had to confess that these fellows knew their business . They collected up some dry seasoned wood  --  windfalls or driftwood ( good salt-soaked driftwood is the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a circle , like wagon spokes , so : QbThat way , when the ends burned down , all you had to do was shove the logs in farther . It saved chopping so much wood . But first , they 'd laid a ring of coral chunks around the outside , to keep off the wind , and they had an iron grill to put over the logs , along with an old dented-up pot to place on top . Lauriette was afraid we might starve to death , but the food turned out fine . One of the men shot an egret , a beautiful bird with feathers that were considered more valuable later on , and another paddled the canoe into the bay , hoisted sail and trolled for thirty minutes , using a wire hook covered with white heron feathers . When he came back he had a dozen mackerel and speckled trout , and one sheephead , a big fellow with broad blackand-whitestripes , that he caught on the bottom using fish-belly bait . They cut up the egret and the fish , including the entrails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other things from pouches they carried , and made a chowder . It was delicious . Theyp233had one crude hand-carved wooden spoon amongst them , and passed it around , which seemed perfectly workable and polite to me , but no , Lauriette had to lay her ears back and balk . She made an elaborate show of hauling out Reverend Muckleroy 's kit , extracting a spoon , and wiping it clean on her handkerchief . In some ways , she could be as offensive as Uncle Jim in one of his ornery moods . I ought to state here that these Indians never were hostile or rude , after that first experience with Lauriette . They just were n't interested ; they ignored us . It was only a few years previous that they 'd retreated South  --  many branches of them  --  into the Evergladeson the east and Big Cypress Swamp on the west , and knocked off fighting . But they resented the way they 'd been handled , and had no regard for the whites . It was all right with me . All I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any complimentson my hair , but I preferred it to lie where it was rather than dangle from somebody 's belt . It was more comfortable that way , and easier to comb . Once we 'd eaten , they washed out their pot with sand , then threw up an overnight chickee , or roof on stilts . They made the thatch from palmetto , and hoisted a pole floor up a couple of feet off the ground . This was to keep clear of snakes , and the open sides  --  like permanent Seminole chickees  --  were to prevent the house from blowing away during hurricanes . They had lots of those storms down here . Lauriette raised a yowl about bedding down on the same platformwith Indians , but nobody paid any attention except Charlie . Very meeky and mild , he said she might prefer sleeping outside with rattlesnakes crawling over her . He could fix it if she insisted , he said , and told her they had a fine remedy for snake-bite which usually worked in as many as three cases out of four . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she got peeved all over again when two Indians picked up their traps and went to sleep in the boat , after she 'd sprayed herself with perfume . They could n't stand it , they said ; it made them sick . I told her it served her right , and I had a notion to join them , but she said , " Oh , shut up ! " in such a brisk tone that I thought it wiser not to pursue it.  |p234We  did our communications with the guides by way of CropearedCharlie . For some reason , he liked white people , and as a matter of fact , that 's how he lost his ears . It was shortly before the end of the Second Seminole War , during what came to be known as the Colee Massacre , in the New River section of South Florida . Charlie , who was a young boy then , liked the Colee familyand heard his elders planning to destroy not only the Colees but the whole settlement there . Well , very plucky , he passed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even so , most of them were saved because of the boy , and afterwards the Indians found out who upset their surprise . They held a tribal council ( as Seminoles do about everything ) and took his case under advisement . As it worked out , he got off practically scot-free on account of his youth and previous good record . The Seminoles always were a fair-minded people , and conduct better courts than the white men ; I 've heard a number of people say so since . So they cut off his ears and banished him for life to an Evergladesisland so scraggly that nobody else wanted it . But he had a girl that liked him , and by and by she talked the chiefs into letting him come back into the tribe again . Being a young man of good sense , he was n't mad at anybody , so he went right ahead associating with whites . In addition , his ears , though missing ( probably used in a stew , or given to some deserving child for a plaything ) never bothered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not having a backboard to bounce off , he simply swiveled his body at an angle , to let the sound get a straight shot at him . Charlie became well known around the settlements , particularlylater on the East Coast , and I reckon he 'd hit it off especially well with Reverend Muckleroy . Once you got used to his looks , and he was a shocker at first sight , he was as enjoyable as a personwith all their parts intact . Something else you might say for him , I suppose , was that he 'd been converted to a religious Christian , and carried a stick which he notched every day , to observe Sunday . Well , on the sixth or seventh evening , when we pulled pastp235Charlotte Harbor ( on my 1840 map ) and onto the beautiful islandcalled Sanybel-cluttered up with the handsomest kind of sea shells  --  I realized that something was up . Mistippee , who was boss of the guides ( after Charlie ) , collected the others together and did a lot of talking , for a Seminole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result . One thing they 'd jawed out was our route to the Shark River and Cape Sable ( from which we 'd sail over to the Keys ) . Naturally , we 'd agreed to stay clear of trading posts and Forts . Two or three now wished to travel up the Calusahatchee River and into Lake Okeechobee ; after that , they knew the hidden waterwaysdown through the Everglades and across the Grassy Waters . Mistippee preferred to strike south from Sanybel into the Big Cypress Swamp . It would be shorter that way , and a couple of our fellows had been here before , during the wars ; so they knew how to navigate , in a general sort of way . The argument arose because of the difference in Seminoles . All of them were Creeks , of course , driven out of Georgia and Alabama at different times in the old days , and afterward mixed with runaway negroes plus a few renegade Spanish . ( King Phillip , for instance , who 'd been their head chief , was the son of an authentic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribes remained in two factions in Florida . One branch , that liked to hunt and fish ( and fight ) for a living , took up residence in Big Cypress , which was about as easy to find your way around in as the South Pole ; the other went to live in the main Everglades , south and east of Lake Okeechobee , meaning Broad Water  --  the giant fresh-water lake in the center of south Florida that flows steadily over thousands of square miles of grassy flat lands to the sea . Now , the funny thing was that the Big Cypress bunch , called Mikasukis , spoke a different dialect than those in the Everglades , who were known as Muskogees , or Cow Indians , because they liked to live off cattle and crop-raising . The two could scarcely understand each other 's speech . Our argument arose because this bunch was Muskogees , ex/cept for the one named Mistippee , and most had a healthy respect for the Indians of Big Cypress . The Mikasukis were fierce , and no mistake . They 'd never wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bowlegs was raising cain , and had jumped a party of would-be Government surveyors and shot them full of holes . Of course , the surveyors had destroyed all the Indians ' gardens first , purely out of meanness . They trampled down row after row of corn , beans , pumpkins and bananas , after takingwhat they wanted for themselves . But it was bad judgment , because they 'd penetrated Billy Bowlegs ' domain , built on high ground , or hammocks , here and there in Big Cypress , and were out of their element . So when the Indiansvoted to strike back , and did , the Government decided it was a poor idea to attempt a survey of the swamps after all , and called Billy Bowlegs a menace . Naturally , nobody considered the Indians ' side of it  --  a season 's crops ruined for nothing  --  but only belly-ached about the shooting . Anyhow , to get back on the track , we tried to make up our minds which way to go . We had to solve it right now , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gulf ; no more key-chains to shelter behind . Charlie himself was wishy-washy , mainly because he figured everybody would behave and be nice , no matter where we were . That 's the way he was himself , so he always looked for others to be like that , too . It seemed an odd stand for a man without any ears , particularly since the white people he 'd warned tattled on him to the Indians and the Indians carved him up to chip in their brotherly bit . He 'd got it from everybody , you see , but he still believed in them all , as well as any strangers that came along . It 's a pity there are n't more like him . We hashed it over , and Lauriette settled , with Mistippee , on Big Cypress . His reasons were simple : he did n't care to do any more paddling than necessary . As to Lauriette , she wanted to get the trip over on account of her delicate nose , and the mosquitoes . Full of impudence , she asked Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as they had those opinions of their own about perfume . So that was settled . The other thing they brought up was that we were being followed . On our fourth night 's encampment , beside a creek on the mainland , two Indians crept out of the scrub and talked with Charlie and Mistippee , and the next day we left a man behind . For this service , they laid a demand of ten dollars extra from Lauriette , for the visitors to canoe him , and she coughed up without , any comment for once . Well , they did n't tell us why then , because Charlie disliked to scare us , but now , with our missing guide returned , we heard the whole story . It was two black-bearded white men and a couple of Indian paddlers , in a much lighter outrigger dugout . They were coming on fast , and looked as though they meant business . " Bad Indians , most , " Charlie said . " Mikasukis , not caring damn if white people live or die . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very unpleasant surprise . I thought we 'd shook them off . We explained the situation to Charlie , stressing how dangerous it was , and he said the men were likely very good fellows , and maybe missionaries . " Missionaries your grandmother , " said Lauriette . " They 're murderers . They want to kill this boy and capture me . Now what do you propose to do ? " One thing positive ; she always hit right to the point . There was never any beating about the bush with her . Charlie seemed uneasy . Being sure we 'd got away unseen , he was now upset at the thought of violence . But he 'd promised to deliver us whole , so he held a conference with Mistippee . When he came back , looking sorrowful , he said : " Mistippee kill men five dolla a head . He say he no budge down on price . " " That 's ten dollars for the two of them , " said Lauriette , musing . " What about the Indians ? " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her coldness . She could talk about this with no more concern than if they werep238fixing to squash cockroaches . So , I said to myself , they 're all the same in that family ; I 'll just keep a little closer eye on you , Miss Know-it-all . " Once white mens killed , Se-min-olees no care any more . All happy . Very safe . " " Now wait a minute , " I said . " Why do n't we just run into Big Cypress and lose them ? What 's the use of an execution ? I know they 're villains , but I was brought up with some idea of fair play , and this shooting from ambush , is n't it . . . . No matter how other people were brought up , " I added , giving her a pointed look . " Fiddlesticks . Let 's get rid of them . Quite obviously my darling brother Rex has hired the best men he can find  --  as he said , he 's got unlimited funds  --  and those Indians are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 'll do it my way . " " Wash me out of it , " I said in a voice loud enough for all to hear . " I 'd like it on the record : I 'm not a cold-blooded murderer , and I want it remembered later . " She never batted an eyelash , being deep in thought . " No , " she said , with a brief shake of her head , " I guess it wo n't work . You could n't trust them that far . " " What wo n't work ? " " To offer to pay them double their salary to go back and kill Rex . It 's a good idea , an inspired idea , but we simply could n't depend on it . " Well , that was enough for me . I went ahead and turned in for the night . When a person comes to the place where she 'll consider killing her own brother , I 'm through . They could solve it any way they pleased . As for me , I resolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had . But I never got an opportunity . Nobody told me what they finally decided , and I did n't ask . We pushed off early the next morning and paddled up the Calusahatchee ( which means " river of the Caloosas , " a tribe of giant men who 'd been here before the Seminoles ) . It was one of those regular coppery-dark Florida rivers you see everywhere you go , deep and winding , shell orp239mud bottom , depending on how close to the sea , and surprisingly sweet to the taste , considering all the vegetation rotting in them . The day was hot , and on one bank where the sun shone alligatorsbasked , motionless till they heard us , after which they slid off with a grunt or a hiss . Charlie said they were n't dangerous unlessfood was scarce , but you must never get between a female alligator and her eggs . By good luck , they only got hungry once or twice a week ; then they ate a duck or some fish . It 's odd , but some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Uncle Jim once said it was because they do n't move around and burn up anything . Then he went on to tell about a chap named Buddha who had the peculiarity of sitting on the floor and staring at his navel . The fixture seemed to interest him . Well , this Buddha , who was probably feeble-minded and could n't help it , got to the point where he moved so little he was eating a grain of corn a day . Nothing else  --  no soup , no dessert . I spoke up and said it was about the dullest program I ever heard , and he 'd ought to got out more and seen some people , but Uncle Jim said I 'd missed the whole point . He declined to go into it further , and appeared a little sore . Anyhow , the female alligator will charge you immediately if you cut off her eggs . Charlie said there were crocodiles down on the under-coast , at the edge of the salt water , which would attack anybody any time . He knew a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a creek bank . I never really believed him till later ; our schoolbooks said the crocodiles lived in Africa . We made a portage in mid-afternoon and transferred to another , smaller river ; then on the third day we struck Big Cypress Swamp itself . The whole look of the countryside changed . Now , instead of traveling along rivers , with an occasional carry across dry land of palmetto , cabbage palm ( which has a bud you can boil and eat like cabbage ) , mangrove , scrub oak and slash pine , we were always in swamp except when we landed on a hummock , or high island . These curious knolls , sometimes several miles around , were spelled " hammock " and meant " garden place " long ago inp240an Indian tongue . When we stepped onto the first one , to rest , it was different than any land I 'd ever seen  --  what was called " fully tropical " by Lauriette . Nobody lived here , but had shoved farther south into the swamp . The soil was rich and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some said they were seeded long ago by birds from the West Indies . We could see the remainders of Seminole chickees , also gardens where they 'd grown such things as corn , pumpkins , sweet potatoes , beans and bananas , but this was n't their main diet , as we found out soon enough . Nearly everywhere around these hammocks stood cypress trees , stiff and gaunt like gray dead people , with creepers trailing from their arms , their lower trunks and roots in water that flowed quietly southward . Now in September the water was three to four feet high , covering the sharp saw grass most places , but as endless and mixed-up as the Sahara Desert . It was no wonder white troops never made any headway with the Seminoles down in these gloomy swamps . It was awesome . Sometimes you 'd glide along a water-way where you had depth and room ; next minute , the marshy , grassy bottom rose up to hem you in all around . Unless you knew your business and found the channels , you had little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see any signs of life , except for birds and fish and alligators and occasional snakes that slithered out of the way pretty fast . Wading birds  --  wood ibis , blue and white herons , egrets , spoonbills , anhingas  --  were everywhere one day and nowherethe next , depending on the wind  --  and circling birds like hawks and gulls and bald eagles and turkey buzzards could generallybe seen soaring against the low , puffed-up , stormy looking clouds that rode the horizon hereabouts . Now and then , a pink flight of flamingoes flapped along , in a slow , clumsy formation , and if they flew close you could see how spindly frail they were . The color of some was practically red ; they were flashy . Taken by and large , though , I never saw a place so dismal quiet and unpersonal . A broody , prehistorical hush lay over itp241and gave me the jimjams . It was as if humans did n't count in these parts ; the swamp did n't care whether you lived or died . It made no difference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very long to them , only enough to pick out your eyes and other juicy parts , leaving the rest to the alligators and the carrion game or fish . By nightfall , we reached a big hammock where two Seminole clans called the Otters and the Frogs lived together . It was confusing . Even though , since then , I studied it out with a travelingEnglish schoolmaster at our Key , who 'd lived among the Mikasukis , I have n't rightly got it straight yet . Maybe no white person has , because of the peculiarities in Indian tongues , which run more vexatious than comes out in books about Indians . These Otters where we landed never married up with the Frogs , who they considered different some way . Mostly , the Big Cypress Seminoles were organized into clans , each one taking a totem for its name , on the order of Otter , Frog , Panther , Wildcat , Tiger , and Snake . ( This last bunch was mixed heavy with negroes , it was said . ) But they boiled it down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That is , they also had a loyalty to what the schoolteacher called a " sib , " which was a kin that descended from the mother 's side , rather than the father 's , as we do . The Otters and Frogs lived together in every way except marriage and had several hammocks nearby where they raised crops and hunted . Well , the first thing I noticed , when we pulled up our dugout and walked in , was that nobody paid us any attention . The Indian women sitting at work on the ground never lifted their eyes in our direction ; not one of them . Several men lying on the platformof a chickee talked to Mistippee but treated Charlie like a traveling hawker . It was embarrassing . Still , they permitted us lodging , and that was better than nothing . But was n't Lauriette sore ! She was used to a hullabaloo being raised wherever she went ( being honestly handsome ) so when even the women ignored her , she got her dander up . Moreover ,  |p242she  was having some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cold , wet canoe . I did n't understand it very well , but she was suffering pain . Well , when she finally swallowed her pride enough to tell Charlie , he said he 'd speak to an Otter doctor . Just before sundown , a medium-old man carrying a deerskin bag and a bamboo tube with feathers on one end came over , not very eager , and addressed Lauriette in a crackle of words that made no sense at all . But Charlie translated and said : " Doctor say he know troubles , can fix . " " How ? By mumbling chants and jumping up and down ? " asked Lauriette , as ungracious as always . Here she was , getting free medical advice , a house call to boot , and she had to quiz the man like an amateur . " Doctor say take off clothes , spread bodies down over log , facing east , he fix . " Charlie said the doctor must first blow his breath  --  his " ammunition "  --  on the unhealthy part through his medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acini and cakani  --  cedar leaf and sassafras . " He will not ! I 'd rather suffer all the way to Key West . Tell him to go blow on somebody else . " Charlie shrugged , then explained the situation to the doctor , who shook his pipe a few times , looking angry , and left . He did n't like the way the case had gone at all . You take the most of his patients , they were probably decent and obliging . If the doctor said strip off and lie face-down on a log , they did it , and likely thanked him for it . But before Lauriette crawled up on the chickee platform they 'd assigned us , Charlie said , very timid and shy , " Muck-el-roy give tobacco ? " " You saw it as plainly as we did . Unless you 're blind . " " Not for smokes , not chew . " " What , then ? " Lauriette asked , her face slightly pink . Charlie untied one of our pouches and took out a long tobacco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and handed it to her.  |p243Beet  red , she snatched it out of his hand and disappeared into the bushes . She was one too many for me , but her temper improveda hundred per cent in the next few hours ; there was n't any doubt about that . One way or another , there 's a lot of relief to be got out of tobacco , and do n't let people tell you different . The Otters ( like other Seminole clans we met ) had one large chickee for cooking , and the women gathered there to prepare the clans ' meals on a grill over one of those wagon-spoke fires . They had two main things to eat , a kind of porridge made out of grits , called sof kee , and hunks of fried fresh-water fish that Charlie said were bass , blue gills , catfish and blackfish ( or mudfish ) . When the food was ready , it was carried from one family chickee to another . The pots they had were all iron or stone ; at one time they 'd used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , somebody said , and a lot of people died . That 's what they thought it was , anyway . Well , this was a good dinner , and even Lauriette tucked in and ate like a gormandizer . You could carry on all you pleased about savages , these Seminoles ate very well . They cultivated a plant called coontie , or arrowroot , and made starch and flour from it , and produced their own grits by dropping shelled corn into the hollowed-out end of a log then grinding it with a wooden pestle . On other hammocks , the Otters hunted possums , turkeys , rabbits , tiny deer no bigger than goats , coons , and sometimes bears in the late autumn , when they were sluggish from storing up fat for the winter . Also , these Indians caught a good number of turtles and prepared them in various ways . The meat was tasty , though hard , on the order of veal cutlet . Their gardens overflowed with vegetables and fruit in this soil that was thin but very rich . Besides the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sugar cane , melons , and , of course , cabbage palms ; and they 'd planted a number of fruit trees on the order of guava and several kinds of citrus . Some of the families were bee-keepers , too , but most seemed mortal swollen aboutp244the neck and hands . I do n't know why , but Indians and bees do n't mix ; it may have something to do with the way each other smells . In that line , I should tell the most popular crop they had was pigs , or hogs . Cattle ranged on some hammocks , but not in the same numbers as hogs . I never saw another sight like it . Hogs overran the place , in and out of everything . They were as cool as you please about strolling into your chickee and gobbling up whatever lay about , and if they did n't eat your shoes , you were lucky . The reason was , Seminoles made pets out of hogs , as whites do dogs , and allowed them to sleep in their beds . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall short of tidy , and not many make an effort to spruce up and reform about the house . It was annoysome . You 'd be about to drop off to sleep when there 'd come a grunt and burrowing and some Otter 's pet would be climbing up to join in . It almost drove Lauriette wild ; she said her interest in pigs was limited to the roasted variety , with an apple in its mouth . She said she 'd never before appreciated the ceremonial hogbutcheringat Belle Mead , but if she ever went back , God forbid , she 'd enjoy each execution with relish . She kept a heavy stick in bed , to discourage pig sociability , and she kicked hogs now and then in the village , too . It attracted her mean looks , as it naturally would . I asked her how she 'd like it if visiting Seminoles kicked her dog , but she said she had never cared for all " the ridiculous pomp and circumstance " about hunting back home , so they were welcome to go up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give them a note , what she called a " laissez passer . " This girl was a tough nut . Mostly , Otter hogs were n't as fragrant as the kind white folk keep . They fed largely on pine mast , back in the pine woods , rather than on swill , and the mud they wallowed in was maybe a little cleaner , being shell and sand and marl , which is a kind of crumbly clay . The pigs got moved around some , from hammockto hammock , along with the Seminoles themselves . Whenp245the soil played out in a place , the Indians gave it a rest , ambling on till it recovered . They were smart about farming , Charlie said . For instance , they grew corn on one patch for two years only ; then they laid off that crop for several seasons . We stayed on this first big hammock two days , or until Lauriette could sit ; then we continued our journey , heading southwest to trick our pursuers , who were now a day and a half behind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzled how they could still be following , because we had taken to little known water-ways , where trailing was next to impossible . Well , after lunch of the first day out from the Otters , we shuffledourselves around to even up on the paddling . I was placed near the stern , before a young fellow who 'd never given us a glance since we started . I believe he was the surliest fellow I ever met . We ignored him . He wore one of those knee-length tunics , with patches and stripes and the like , and when he climbed in , I noticed that some of the patches were missing . It was odd , because Seminoles keep their clothes in good order . Somehow , I could n't push it out of my mind . As we skimmed along , with birds circling overhead , saw grass all around except in narrow channels , hammocks like oases in the desert showing off in the distance , and rolled-up clouds on the horizon , I found myself glancing backward out of the corner of my eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian any attention . And then , betweenpaddle dips , he quickly tore off a piece of red patch and dropped it over the side . So that was it . He 'd been dropping them all along . Even a dunce could follow markers like that , for the red cloth would catch onto saw grass and stay visible all along the way . Trying to think what to do , I became so fidgety I could hardly sit still . But I had to wait all through the afternoon and until we stopped for the night ; I had n't the least idea how many might be in with him . First chance I got , ashore on a deserted hammock , I drew Charlie aside and told him what I 'd seen . In his usual saphead way , he thought the man might be playing a game with fish .
