No civil rights group puzzles the U.S. press more than S.N.C.C. ( Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee ) , the young militants who go by the acronym " Snick . " While some commentators applaud Snick 's success in helping Southern Negroes on a grass-roots level , others fret that Snick is being infiltrated by extremists and Communists . In this month 's Commentary , Novelist Robert Penn Warren digs deeper into Snick than anyone to date . In probing interviews , Warren draws out two leading Snickers ( as they are called by Southern cops ) , who give some surprising-and reassuring-reasons for belonging to Snick . <P> Subjugating Others . Harlem-born Bob Moses , 30 , is probably the most battle-scarred of all Snickers . In his efforts to register Negro voters in Mississippi , he has been beaten , burned , stabbed and shot at ; he is now so hardened to it all that he can take a snooze in a car that is being chased by rednecks . Who is Moses ' revolutionary mentor ? Marx ? Mao Tse-tung ? No , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never loses sight of individual values . " It 's important to recognize in the struggle certain humanitarian values , " Moses told Warren , " to recognize that you have to struggle for people , and at the same time-if it 's possible-you try to eke out some corner of love or some glimpse of happiness within . And that 's what I think more than anything else conquers the bitterness . <P> " The dichotomy , " continues Moses , who earned an M.A. in philosophy at Harvard , " is whether you can cease to be a victim any more and also not be what Camus calls an executioner . The ideal lies between these two extremes - victim and executioner . For when people rise up and change their status , usually somewhere along the line they become executioners , and they get involved in subjugating other people . The problem is whether you can move Negro people from the place where they are now the victims of this kind of hatred to a place where they do n't in turn perpetuate this hatred . In the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to share the land , and the less overlay of bitterness , the more possible it will be to work out a reconciliation . " <P> Discarding Dogma . Stokely Carmichael , 23 , born in Trinidad but raised in Harlem , used to be a doctrinaire socialist . During National Student Association conferences , he remembers from his high school days , " I took the floor and said just any ridiculous thing . Here were students from all over the country , and they never would have attacked me no matter what I said , because I was a Negro . The whole thing has shifted so much , if you 're a Negro and among a white group , you 're good , you 're great , you're-but I am sure you know Negroes are bastards too . " <P> When Carmichael read of the 1960 sit-ins that created Snick , he dismissed them : " Niggers are just like monkeys - one do , all do . I was distressed . You know , you do n't want a revolution ; you want to be intelligent . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which cured him of his economic dogmatism . Class warfare , he decided , did not sufficiently explain the sit-ins . " I realized that a lot of kids were n't talking about what I thought they would be talking about . They said , simply , ' We have the right to human dignity . ' "
