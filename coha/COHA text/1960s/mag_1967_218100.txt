Along with other consumer items , the U.S. public is now paying more for magazines . Last month Reader 's Digest and Look raised their newsstand price from 350 to 500 . TIME increased from 40 to 50 . Last year the Saturday Evening Post and the Saturday Review jumped from 25 to 35 . Newsweek and U.S. News &; World Report rose from 35 to 40 , Cosmopolitan and Redbook from 35 to 50 . Holiday spurted from 60 to 75 , Town &; Country from 75 to $1.00 . <P> The increases were substantial , explain the publishers , because costs-especially wages and printing-plant expenses-have risen sharply . To date , there has been no audible squawk from readers , and newsstand sales of most magazines have not suffered . To be sure , newsstand sales generally account for only a small percentage of overall sales , most of which are by subscription . But then , it is likely that subscription rates will also rise soon .                   @ @
