It is the South , a land of snakes and swamps and sassy catfish ; a land clogged with faded ' advertisements for ' snuff and fertilizer , and highway signs proclaiming that " The End Is Near ? Prepare To Meet Thy ' God ! " It is a land , too , of unparalleled boom , whose crackling fire of prosperity is refueled by the scorching backlash of each departing rocket , of this space age . In future years , after the almost frantic effort to reach the moon has been throttled ' down to a commonplace judgment of either spectacular success or supreme folly , this section of the country will likely be remembered as having ' stood in bold relief on the economic flatness of the 1960s . This area , originally called the missile crescent but now more properly the space crescent , arches from Brevard County ( site of Cape Kennedy ) in Florida , up to northern Alabama , and then down to New Orleans and west to Houston . Today , along certain points of that arc , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  changes laid out on that foundation of half fantasy from which the drive into space is unable to divorce itself . The crescent ' stations of cyclonic activity set up by the National Aeronautics and Space Adaninistration ( NASA ) ' are , in. addition to ' Cape Kennedy , the George C. Marshall Space Flight : Center in Huntsville , Ala. ; the mammoth Michaud Operations : rocket manufacturing plant in NeW Orleans ; the 128,000-acre Mississippi Test ' Operations site ( about 35 miles north of Michoud ) and the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston . The impact of NASA 's work in the crescent area ranges from staggering to lightly discernible , but in every case ' the changes it effects must be reckoned with not only in terms of economics but socially and politically as Well . The two latter contexts will be examined in future article 's , but it is necessary first to look at . ? the crescent in terms of money , , since that is the corporate society 's natural ' starting place . From profit everything else springs : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force ; ' not because of any urgent desire to correct injustice , but because the government now demands of its ' contractors that they present an image , no matter how shallow , of social awareness ( except for the ' FBI , NASA itself is probably the whitest , most blue-eyed , crew-cut , Protegtarit agency in government ) . A Congressman votes for passage of " an obviously outlandish space approPria-ton , not because he looks forWard 211 to the clay when his grandchildren can go to summer camp on Mars , but because the president of a corporation doing business with NASA is his good friend and chief campaign benefactor . in the simplest terms , NASA is charged with managing the most ambitious purchase order ever drawn up by the government of the United States It calls for a trip to the moon and return within this decade . The cost of the order varies according to the official giving the estimate , but almost everyone concerned agrees that $20 billion would not be far off . To speculate on how many slums could be eradicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be futile ; generally , the Congressman who is ready to ax space funds is equally opposed to government appropriations for pressing social needs . Space spending occupies an almost hallowed position in government fiscal policy . It has been allowed to go its own way , hooking the economy to a point where any withdrawal would be painful , especially in the Southern crescent . Those who do question the wisdom of spending so much on so many vague concepts of progress are quickly put down . Such was the case , last June when the Senate agreed to reconsider its approval , given only a few days earlier , of a $5.2 billion appropriation for the space program . The action was inspired by Senator Wayne Morse ( D , Ore ) , who voiced dismay at the lack of debate on the appropriation which he described as " far exceeding the negative connotation of a boondoggle . " But less than twerity4our hours later , the money bill was through the Senate with every penny intact Only two Senators ; Paul H. Douglas ( D. , Ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , joined Morse in opposition . It was with well-based confidence , then , that J. H. Reed , of NASA 's Management Office in Huntsville , could predict at a session of the Canaveral Space Congress this year that the space program , is likely to involve massive annual outlays " for as long into the future as men can imagine . " With the great majority of the space dollars going to private contractors ( 90 per cent in the case of the budget for the Manned Spacecraft-Center in Houston ) , the eco2 I 2 nomic impact has become something other than " healthy . " It has begun to give form to a monster of manipulation . Seldom before has so much subcontracting and joint-venture bidding been conducted under the mantle of free enterprise . The space program is ceding to private industry ' a degree of power that in no way meshes with the economic workings of a democracy . Some NASA officials express concern over this development , but most are blind to all but their dedication  --  it borders on nobility  --  to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to do are too big for any one company to handle . For example , when the agency called for bids on construction of a building in which to assemble the massive , 365-foothigh Saturn V moon rocket , the ' specifications were enough to awe the most daring of entrepreneurs . The building , to be constructed on the government 's recently acquired 88,000 acres of mostly swampland ( average cost of dredging and filling , $7,000 per acre ) on Merritt Island , adjacent to the Cape Kennedy complex , will rise 524 feet and cover more than 7 acres . It will be large enough to hold the Pentagon-and another building half its size . On January 7 of this year , NASA announced that the winning bids for joint construction of the vertical assembly buildiiag had been submitted by the Perini Corp. , Morrison-Knudsen Co. , Inc. , and Paul Hardeman Construction Co. , Inc . The contract is for $63.3 million , the largest amount for any single piece of aerospace construction in this country . " Joint venture bidding is not new , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manned Spacecraft Center , said . " That , along with prime contracting and subcontracting , is done quite often . " But how often does the commitment run to more than $60 million ? ' Such a sum implies , in addition to a pooling of resources and construction know-how , a consolidation ? of corporate power to protect the deep involvement . Cartels have sprung from smaller acorns of harmony . Dave W. Lang , procurement officer at the Manned Spacecraft Center , views it all in a shining light of All-American team spirit . " To achieve our goals within this decade , " he has said , " we must call on a variety of talent and industrial strength from all parts of the country . Through an integrated system , we arrive at a product that insures the success of the program . . . each region has its share of the program because each part of the country has some talent it can contribute to the overall effort . " Nowhere is the " call " he speaks of more ' clearly heard than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant motion . executives of space-related industries rushing from conference to conference and filling the magnolia-scented air with the impersonal drone of the credit-card sophisticate ; thousands of pretty secretaries placing hurried long-distance telephone calls and reserving rent-a-cars for their bosses ( it sometimes seems that space people cover more miles with Hertz and Avis than they do with successful rocket flights ) ; high-rise apartment and office buildings going up as quickly as the soil can be , tested and turned ; everyone making lots of money except the poor Southern farmer who has lived in the area all his life and does n't quite know what all the fuss is about . The impact is most striking in Florida 's Brevard County . There the most rapid population growth of any county in the nation is now , being recorded . To the communities of Cocoa , Cocoa Beach and Cape ' Canaveral , where not too many years ago a roadside fruit stand was a substantial enterprise , have come such industrial giants as Chrysler , Boeing , Douglas Aircraft , General Electric , Ford , RCA and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flanked by scores of luxurious motels have moved in , making this area the somewhat garish nerve center of the new economic vitality . In fact , the economy of Brevard County began to change when the housewife stopped squeezing oranges for juice . The world-famous Indian River citrus is grown there , and as juice in cans and cartons gained popularity , innovations in marketing and shipping the fancy fruit had to be made . After much consolidation , six major packing houses were left , each employing between 100 and 150 persons for eight months of the year The combined payroll for the eight-month year ranged from $600,000 , to $1,500,000 . That was the chief October 12 , 1964 industry in the county . But now the aerospace industry payroll is $130 million a year . And it is still rising . " It should reach $200 million a year by 1970 , " said Mayo Hill , executive secretary of the Cocoa Chamber of Commerce and a former citrus grower . In Brevard , as elsewhere along the crescent , the ominous signs of swelling , uncontrolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The role of Pan American Airways at the Cape Kennedy complex is a case in point . Eleven years ago , Pan American contracted with the Air Force to serve as housekeeper of the Atlantic Missile Range , its duties including such chores as delivering food to the mess halls and maintaining security ( a visitor to Cape Kennedy has to pass the scrutiny of guards employed not by the government but by Pan American ) . In the beginning , this division of the corporation had about fifty employees . As missile activity accelerated , Pan American 's responsibilities increased , with the emphasis moving gradually but unmistakably from service to science . The employees , now number 7,000 , with a payroll of $144 million , most of which is dumped in Brevard . County . The division still keeps the floors swept all right , but it also has taken on technological planning in such fields as instrumentation of sophisticated space vehicles . " I want to make it clear on the point of who runs the range " the Atlantic Missile Rangel , a Pan American spokesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Air Force men assign Our tasks , review and approve our plans , and in general look over our shoulder to assure quality of performance , that costs are reasonable , and that the mission is accomplished in the most effective and economical manner . Responsibility for making the final decisions , he emphasized , rests with the Air Force . It is understandable that the spokesman should stress the " management " aspect of the space program , for that is the key to the economic juggernaut now sweeping through the crescent . The stark fact is , however , that Pan American and Boeing ? and Chrysler and all the others are taking the ball away from the government . In aerospace work , the climate for proliferation of self-interests is even more favorable than it is in the defense industry . Pan American , for example , is pushing what it ' calls the " state of the art " in a galaxy of space-related fields . Lockheed ' Missiles and Space Co. looks beyond the moon landing and reveals that its scientists , after three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bubble-shaped car for travel on the moon . And Westinghouse Electric Corp . is completing ' work on a nuclear power plant that can be transported in the nose of a Saturn V rocket and used to provide electricity at a lunar base . These concepts of future space hardware are being drawn up with the idea that Someone is going to buy  --  someone being , of course , the federal government . In that way , the space program rolls merrily along , propelled by the companies themselves ; it is not allowed to slow down , even at the crossroads where science turns into science fiction . NASA 's control has become so slack that m at least one case the agency 's suggestions for change in design of a spacecraft were resisted by the contractor respOnsible f  --  l. the technology of that particular program . Involved was the trbubleplagued Ranger spacecraft , and a good measure of the blame for its many launch failures before it finally got off last August can be traced to the contractual relationship between NASA and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cal Tech receives an annual fee of $1 million , making it , in effect , a prime aerospace contractor Still , the laboratory was in such firm control of the Ranger program that it could virtually ignore NASA 's suggestions on design ( See " Pentagon and Campus : The Sullen Marriage " by Wesley Marx , The Nation , May 18 , 1964 . ) Alas , arrogance , like almost everything else in the space program , does not come cheap , in this case , it cost the taxpayers $250 million . It is little wonder , then , that with a shopping budget that permits millions in waste , NASA is regarded in the Southern crescent as the greatest thing to come along since horn-My ' grits . The people there are happily awash in an atmosphere of tingling anticipation  --  as if sooner or later a man from Washington 213 were going to knock on every door of every house in every community and say : " Here 's 150 million bucks . We want to rent your son 's space helmet . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston , the word spread quickly that it was to be a rocket launch facility . The structure grew taller and excitement mounted . Already grOwing at such a rate that it may well be the largest city in the world by the year 2000 , according to the Lloyds of London survey , Houston was to eaiyand its space program participation even to include launchings ! More industry rushing in ; more money spilling into the streets ; the eyes of the world glued on the gantry-spiked prairie ! Finally , workmen plunked a tank down on top of the structure , and the awful truth struck home . In this space-oriented age of exotic design , a common old water tower was a crushing anticlimax . But ' disillusion with NASA is the rarest exception in the Southern crescent . The much more typical situation is that of a man named Milton K. ' Cummings and the coin-2i4 than a dozen years ago , Brown Engineering 's entire work force totaled fifteen . It was strictly a local business , characterized by the sloth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , when Cummings stepped in as president , the company was about to go bankrtipt . He quickly brought in fresh talent , ' diversified operations and went calling on officials at the nearby George C. Marshall Space Flight Center , Today , Brown . Engineering is ? among NASA 's top dozen contractors . It employS 3,400 in five major operating divisions ; its research laboratories are spread out over an 80-acre site in outlying Huntsville , and ? there are branch units at each of the stations of space activity along the crescent . Cummings developed the largest and most diversified space-work machine shop in the South . " We do all of ' the work , from the drawing board to the finished product . " Many of the products the company supplies , such . as Cable masts for the base of a rocket 's tail , are being built for the first time " Our original budget was high because aerospace industries started with nothing , " Cummings said " Everything had to be built . " So , in the beginning , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last year , Brown Engineering 's overall sales reached $33,122,824 , Soniething else that Cummings did was , hire Joseph C. Moquin as executive vice president in charge of - technical management . Moquin was chief management engineer at Redstone Arsenal , of which the Flight Center is a part . Herein lies another reason why NASA is losing control to priyate industry : for , all of the money it , spends , the agency 's salary . scale is law ( Dr. , Wernher von Braun receives less than $25 , 000 a year ) and more and more , of its , top talent is joining space-re7. lated industries . The presence of the Space Flight Center has wrought - great economic changes in . Huntsville and all of Madison County . Between twenty and ? wenty-five spaCe-related industrial plants are there now , and another 100 firms , with an interest in the space program , ? ave representatives in the area . One of the ? indpstries with a large ? local payroll is called SPaco , ' Inc . It is a grand space-age name  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old Huntsville firm . Before rockets were invented , it made awnings , and the letters in its name , stand for Southern Protective Awning Co , Now it has almost 500 employees , turns out components for missiles and enjoys annual gross sales in the millions of dollars Such are the good fortunes of being in the right place at the right time and having a name so deserving ' of a role in this drama of the new South  --  a ' South where help-wanted newspaper advertisements ' for bean pickers have been replaced by ones for teleinetry data processing programers ; a South where books on applied mathematics outsell Douglas Freeman 's three-volume set of Lee 's Lieutenants . The first Wave ' of the space program 's billions of dollars washed up on Huntsville and the statistics of the growth that followed are overwhelming . Population is up from 16,000 just ten . years ago to more than , 110,000 today ( the number of The NA ? IOrl pupils in the Huntsville schools now exceeds the city 's total population in 1950 ) ; construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of amount for an Alabama city in one , year ; retail sales soared to $60 million in the first cinarter of 1964 , up almost 20 per cent from the same period last year and making Huntsville the second fastest-growing metropolitan market in the nation ; annual sale of kilowatt hours of electricity has more than tripled in eight years ; 1,000 new telephones were installed during January of this year alone . Old-time residents of Huntsville say now that maybe Henry Ford was right . They are harking back more , than forty years to the time when the car maker from Detroit stood looking at the pleasant , rolling hills of northern Alabama and predicted that one day there would be a city stretching from Huntsville to , Muscle Shoals . Developers took him at his word ; they bought up land and even laid out street boundaries in the cotton fields . But nothing happened and people said old Henry was wrong ? Huntsville would never ainount to anything more than being the birthplace of Tallulah Bankhead . TVA came in , though , ' bringing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap power and new hope for pr asperity ' . Finally , in April ; 1950 , Wernher van Braun and his group of Gernian scientists moved from FOrt Bliss , , Tex. , to Redstone Arsenal ; and from that day forward , Henry Ford 's , city began to rise and for ' the first time in the history of this country , native-born Sotithern- ers began migrating back to the South to work for the government . " Over the years we have talked about the opportunities that would come when we ' developed our waterways and expanded from a primarily agricultural economy to a diversified eeonomy , " Milton Cummings said . " Now that era of opportunity is here  --  right here in our southland . " The ' diversification , however , is less thari ' sweeping . Huritsville 's economy has indeed spread from cotton fintres to rocket construction , but there , except for a mushrooining of related services , it more or less stops This worries some Who still have , reservations about the durability Of the space program . Tu dispel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , recruited from retirement into " advisory " capacities with aerospace firms , are appearing at service club luncheons in towns along the crescent and assuring the jittery that " the program is here to stay " NonSpaCe-related industries are reluctant to move into the area , however , because of the high wage platform , and at present there are only about 5,000 jobs on the Huntsville labor market in which the federal government is not involved , directly or indirectly . Finther , the boom means little to the unskilled native son . There is no place in ' space for his pick-andshovel talents . During the past several years , less than 100 unskilled persons have been hired , at Redstone Arsenal , and yet they keep coming ? more than 100 a day  --  to the employment office , far work that is n't there . Huntsville tries , to diversify the boom thiaugh its , industrial expansion connOtee. , Handsome bro-chures have ; hehn Pi-Anted ( " . . . a pleasant , sunnynplacet rte , liVe " ) and expensive colar , advertisements placed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) , but so far the bail Aids attracted only more highly , teelyliCal , , iiidustries eager to share banana of the space billionS . The it wiThpast an industrial employinent it gain of perhaps 2,000 jabs phis year ; almost all of them will be in skilled missile work . Should the space program collapse tomorrow , much of Hunts-ville would collapse with it , and all of the expansion would shrivel up . Elsewhere on the crescent , Houston and New Orleans are less dependent on the space program as a foundation for their economies . Nevertheless , the impact is significant . In Houston , for instance , eighty aerospace firms have established new branches or enlarged existing operations as a result of the decision to locate the $147 million ? the original estimated cost was less than half that much ? Manned Spacecraft Center there . In New Orleans , the Michoud Operations facility increased the , number of retail establishments by 300 and retail sales by $33 million . " The Houston business community has been disappointed by the impact , " the Manned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't understand that it was n't going to be a flashy thing , with lots of manufacturing . That was the single big misunderstanding between HOuston and NASA , I believe . " The ' Center , a complex of seventeen handsomely furnished buildings spread out over as many acres , is to be concerned only with the development and manning of the spacecraft . No actual construction work will be undertaken there , and there will be , therefore , no massive stimulation of the economy . Federal funds for the Center amounted in 1963 to $1 3 billion , of which only $11 million was spent on contracts in the Houston area . Construction of the buildings will soon be completed and employnient is expected ' to level off next year , after peaking at around 5,000 . After that , the scientists and the glib young administrators and the astronauts and the smile-a-second secretaries will have everything pretty much to themselves in the thickly carpeted , air-conditioned Center ( NASA , which likes to cite the climate as one of the major reasons for concentrating its activity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every nook and cranny of its installations . ) To an anti-space observer , the Center , rising on the brownish-yellow expanse of parched , deeply rutted prairie , must loom as the ultimate ' in wasteful spectaculars And invariably the question comes to mind : Why go to the moon ? There are dozens of official stock answers to that question , many of them invoking the name of Columbus ( " Columbus took a chance and look what came out of that " ) Paul E. Purser , special assistant to the director of the Manned Spacecraft Center , preferred to use the Cru- ' sades for a parallel . " The ideal we are striving for , " he said , " is a concept of living . The moon is only ' the material symbol of this concept , as the city of Jerusalem was only thesymbolic goal , of the Crusaders . " He went on to warn that the whole project involves a challenge to " our democratic way of life by the controlled society , where the state is supreme . " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Anastas Mikoyan replacing J. Edgar Hoover in the , event that we do n't reach the moon first . NASA is forced to take that vision seriously because it answers the question , not why man should go to the moon , but why it is necessary to use a crash program to get him there . The whole space endeavor is riddled with " shoot-and-bope " failures , all because of the great rush . But failure begets additional research and additional research begets additional contracts to private industry which , in many cases , was responsible for the failure inthe first place . And all of this flurry produces " spin-off " projects  --  those delicious bits of profitable progress ? with which corporate power cements its every gained inch in the drift toward reliance on aerospace for a major support of the nation 's economy . As aerospace continues to be our fastest growing industry , the Southern crescent continues to emerge as the throbbing heart of this new , slide-rule-devised design for living . From Texas to the east coast of Florida , and from New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frantically to keep the heart on a rapid beat . Even now , if the , heart should ' fail , there would be . a ' gasping for breath in Kalamazoo as well as in Cocoa . Our economic ' commitment ' to space has gone that far .
