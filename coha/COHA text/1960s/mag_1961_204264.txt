The voice , like wind through sugar cane , first rustled into U.S. living rooms last year singing " Now it 's a Pepsi . . . for those who think young . " Joanie Sommers , owner of the voice , has come a long way since those anonymous days , has already earned her first quarter-million dollars ( and her first ulcer ) at the age of 20 . Says she : " I 'm a worrywart . I 'm tired and I ponder about being tired . " <P> At the age of ten , Joanie Drost ( her real name ) won a prize on a Buffalo TV show singing Your Cheating Heart , largely because ( she says ) her numerous relatives bought piles of postcards and stuffed the ballot box by mail . Four years later her family emigrated to California . She recalls : " It was a miracle . We did n't have a flat until we were sitting in a gas station in California . We had $1.62 left . " <P> Joanie 's early career is like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sang-with the jukebox in the tavern where her mother worked , with the Venice ( Calif . ) High School dance band , with a harmony group for the Elks Club . Finally came the Big Audition-with Tommy Oliver 's band at the Deauville country club in Santa Monica , and the Big Click . A demonstration disk played for Warner Bros. record company resulted in her first album , Positively the Most , a title artfully designed to rhyme with Drost . But Joanie had already decided the Drost was dross as far as names went , tried out Joan St. Clair , Joanie Post , and finally decided-for no particular reason-on Joanie Sommers . Says she : " I ca n't think of myself as anybody else now , even if I try . " <P> The album and Joanie 's haunted-hoarse voice , became pets of disk jockeys everywhere . A refreshing change from the smoldering young sirens whose singing style tries to suggest that they are capable of unseemly passion , Joanie sounds throaty but relaxed , is admired both by rock ' n ' rollers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as by those who pant for Ella and Frankie . Mort Sahl heard the records , took a look at gamin-faced Joanie , signed her up to accompany him on a 35-city concert tour . Suddenly everybody wants Joanie . She has just made a movie with Mickey Rooney ( Columbia 's Everything 's Ducky ) , is eagerly sought for TV specials , has nightclub engagements booked solidly for the next six months . <P> Next week Joanie Sommers opens at Las Vegas ' super-caravansary , the Sahara , with Donald O'Connor and a $15,000 wardrobe-a handy index to the high cost of converting a cute girl who sings nicely into a major attraction . Two years ago , she played her first club date in a $2.98 ready-to-wear.
