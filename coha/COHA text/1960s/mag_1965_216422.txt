Happily schussing through snow these days are a lot of skiers who have never seen the stuff falling out of the sky . It is all because of man-made snow , which is drifting down on mountain slopes far south of the Mason-Dixon line-in Tennessee and New Mexico , in North Carolina and most lately in Missouri . Deep in the Ozarks , a resort called ( with some fanfare ) TanTarA has a ski lodge , complete with a 1,700-ft . T-bar and four rope tows , only 175 miles from St. Louis and 160 miles from Kansas City . <P> Strapped Skis . Skiing , in short , is getting to be a southern sport . From balmy Los Angeles it is only 90 miles to Big Bear Lake , where Snow Summit will have more than 20,000 people schussing and slaloming next weekend . Some citizens of Phoenix , Albuquerque , and points in between will strap skis on top of their station wagons , in apparent defiance of the dry , hot desert air , and head for Ski Cloud Croft or Sierra Blanca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Residents of Atlanta can set out for Cataloochee 's five ski slopes at Waynesville , N.C. , only four hours away . Ski-minded residents of Alabama and Mississippi no longer have to read about the glamorous life and peculiar excitement of skiing . Just a few miles across their northern border is the Gatlinburg Ski Resort in Tennessee , where snow machines produce a reliable twelve inches for two months of the winter season . <P> <P> Citizens of Washington , D.C. , who have long insisted that their summer climate is the world 's hottest and their ter rain the flattest , are turning into skiers-three new ski shops have opened in downtown Washington this year . Within 80 miles of the city are : Shawneeland near Winchester , Va. , which had 78 skiing days even in a winter when the natural snowfall was only half an inch ; Skyline Ski Area at Washington , Va. , which has three slopes , a T-bar lift and two rope tows ; Oregon Ridge at Cockeysville , Md. , with four tows and a 1,900-ft. double-track slope ; Strudel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a T-bar lift . The more avid drive four hours to the Homestead Ski Area at Hot Springs , Va. , or Deep Creek Ski Area near Oakland , Md . <P> Chiefly responsible for providing these new horizons for Southerners is the Larchmont Engineering Co. of Lexing ton , Mass. , which has perfected a snowmaking machine that combines water and compressed air in a jet to make a giant atomizer . When the resultant droplets hit the air ( provided the temperature is below 30 ) , they freeze into tiny granules that make a dense powder snow . With enough piping , twelve nozzles and suitable terrain , the snowmaker can produce an 8-in. - deep ski slope 250 ft. by 1,000 ft. overnight . If greater acreage is needed , just add more pipes and more nozzles . Biggest so far is a total of 85 acres , turned out to cover slopes and trails at the Telemark Ski Area in Cable , Wis.
