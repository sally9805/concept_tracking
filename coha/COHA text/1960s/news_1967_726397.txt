The effort , by indistrialists , lawyers , professors , insurance brokers and other long-time residents of the overwhelmingly white suburbs from Evanston to Lake Bluff , turned up 38 open listings among the 2,000 homes for sale in the area . The listings were turned over today to 30 Negro families who have been searching in vain for months for homes in these suburbs . Most live in Chicago 's South Side Negro ghetto and commute daily to jobs north of Chicago : Saturday 's effort was made specifically for five of the . families willing to pay $20,000 to $40,000 .
