TRACK &; FIELD <P> Into the shotput circle at California 's Occidental College strode Dallas Crutcher Long III , known to his friends as the Prince of Whales . Hefting a 16-lb. iron ball in one hammy hand , he crouched low , tucked the ball behind his right ear , and began to inch back his left foot like a second-story man feeling his way down a ladder in the dark . Suddenly , he dipped and flung himself bodily across the ring . A grunt , a gasp-the shot soared through the air and thudded into the turf 66 ft. 3 in. away . For the second time in twenty days-and the third time this spring-Dallas Long had smashed the world record in the shotput . <P> Strongest Ever . At 23 , Long is no longer the fuzzy-cheeked , 255-lb. prodigy who stunned track experts by tying Parry O'Brien 's world mark in 1959 when he was only a freshman in college . Married and a father now , he has put on 10 lbs. , and his graduate studies in dentistry keep him busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last season , and his haphazard practice sessions this year are limited to two nights a week . " It 's always in the dark , " says Long . " I used to climb the playground fence at the grammar school down the block , but the night watchman did n't like that much . So now I use a piece of sidewalk in the park . " <P> Out of shape or not , Long is still the strongest shotputter who ever lived . In four years at the University of Southern California , he topped 60 ft. an astonishing 69 times , won three straight N.C.A.A. championships , and capped his senior season with a record toss of 65 ft. 10 in . Nobody has approached that mark since-except Long himself . Last April he got off a put of 65 ft. 11 in . And one day last month , he showed up at the West Coast Relays in Fresno , limping on a bandaged left foot . " I was working out with pulley weights , " he explained . " They were n't heavy enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . The darned steel cable snapped when the weights were all the way up . They came crashing down on my foot-and drove it into the floor like it was a nail . " Whereupon Long warmed up by hurling the shot 65 ft. 3 in. on his first try , then uncorked a toss of 66 ft. 7 in. - a full in. over his own listed world record . But it went for naught : Fresno officials had unaccountably neglected to put a steel ring around the shotput circle as international rules require . <P> Prospect of Gold . The bait that lured Long back into competition this season , of course , is the prospect of a gold medal at the 1964 Olympics . He will not lack for competition in Tokyo . Randy Matson , a 19-year-old Texas A. &; M. freshman , already has a 64 ft. 10 in. throw to his credit this spring . But by the time the Olympics roll around , Long may be hurling that 16-lb. ball all the way into orbit . " I 've always felt that somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And the way I 'm going , I ought to do it this year . "
