AIR CRAS HE S : GROWI NG PERIL IN THE SKIES : TilE END OF FLI hortly after 10 o'clock on the cold , bright 1 3 morning of March I , 1962 , A merican Airlines ' Flight I ? a 707 jet bound for Los Angeles trundled slowly away from its gate at New York 's Idlewild Airport . As it taxied into position For a takeoff run , gusts of wind slapped down the runways and rippled flags on the terminal building . The weather was perfect , a welcome change after three days of rain . On board that jet were eight crew members and 87 passengers . Among them : an oil millionaire , a university president , a retired scientist who had helped develop the atomic bomb , a Brooklyn postman and a 61 - year- old grandmother who owned a bar and grill in Johnstown , New York . Below . in the luggage compartment , were 15 abstractionist paintings by the late Arshile Gorky and 48 pouches of U.S. mail . No children were aboard ; no pets . At 10:06:52 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a football field  --  began its thundering journey down Runway 31-Left . Its new fan-jet engines whined piercingly . Seconds later , in accordance with noise-abatement regulations , Flight I began the first of several climbing turns designed to carry it away from the heavily populated Howard Beach section of Queens . The message from tower departure control crackled over the radio : " Continue left turn to heading 140 . Report leaving 2,000 feel . " In the cockpit Second Officer Robert J. Pecor , 32 , flicked on his mike . " Continue to 140 . Report leaving two . American One . " Suddenly the jet 's nose lurched hard to the left . The plane banked sharply , to 50 , 60 , 90 degrees , then rolled all the way over onto its back . Slowly , it started to fall , gathering speed as it plummeted straight down . Eight seconds later , it smashed bullet-hard into the shallow flats of Jamaica Bay . It exploded violently , sending columns of spray 200 feet into the air . Sixteen miles away , at Fordham University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crust of the earth , The time was 10:08:49 . Even as rescue workers sped to the scene , the Civil Aeronautics Board had begun its investigation . Last week , ten months later , the Board announced its findings . The probable cause of the crash  --  a rudder-control malfunction sparked AN by a tiny pencil-length wire ' , is of an inch thick . On the surface , announcement that a culprit had been found was not surprising . The technical detectives of the CAB 's Bureau of Safety , doggedly following clues in much the same way as a homicide squad pursues a clever killer , have found answers to 94 percent of all commercial air disasters in the past 23 years . But this time they almost did n't make it . The search begun that morning in March was to be one of the most expensive , exhaustive and frustrating in history . It was barnacled with an ugly cluster of obstacles . Not the least of these was a feud between the two government agencies involved . The man who led the investigation is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Epps . Chief of the CAB 's northeastern region , he is an inquisitive fellow who wears clip-on bow ties , chews the frames of his glasses and punctuates conversations by gesturing with his right hand  --  and asking , " You follow me ? " Everyone agrees that he is able  --  and tenacious . He entered the case early . Minutes after the disaster , an emergency telephone linking his office with Idlewild tower control rang . Van Epps heard tower chief Bill Parenteau 's urgent voice : " A jet has crashed in Jamaica Bay . Location is not certain . We are checking . " Immediately Van Epps dispatched men to the tower to pick up details , then sent others to grab a passenger list from the airline . Meanwhile , investigators Ralph Stokes and Hyman Modelevsky aped to the scene , bouncing down a rutted dirt road that stopped at water 's edge . Two hundred yards from shore they saw the remains of Flight I. Overhead a squad of seagulls screeched and whirled , keeping a disrespectful watch over the dead . Disintegration was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sun like Christmas tinsel . To the right , jutting above the water , was something that looked like a wheel well . Quickly , the investigators set up an emergency telephone , reaching Van Epps just in time to report that fire , stoked by thousands of gallons of kerosene fuel , was sweeping across the water . At Randalls Island five police helicopters were already in the air . Originally their mission had been cheery : to help welcome Astronaut John Glenn to New York . Immediately four of them peeled off and sped to the crash scene . Downtown , at Police Headquarters , chief inspector Francis Robb had already deployed 3,400 men for Glenn 's parade route . Now he ordered 56 members of a tactical " commando " unit to the site and supplemented them with 100 uniformed detectives who had been attending police academy courses on narcotics . Then he called for help from Queens and Brooklyn precincts . At 10:15 the Fire Department recorded the first of three alarms . In all , 19 companies would respond , their men struggling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bay across the marshes . By I I A.M. the site was swarming with 600 rescue workers . One of the first firemen on the scene was Mike Mallazzo , 33 , a thin , hard-eyed former telephone-company lineman . His job was to help remove the shattered bodies . Carefully , almost reverently , he and other rescue workers placed what they could find on stretchers , covered them with pink and gray blankets and carried them to a sand pit . Nearby , a priest knelt to administer the church 's last rites . The tide was coming in fast . Soon water swirled into the pit . They picked up the stretchers again and splashed ashore . As rescue operations wore on , Van Epps began the job that was to take so long : finding out why it all happened . As a first step , he chose members of eight separate investigating groups . Usually , in seeking the cause of a major accident , only four or five groups are employed . But this was the first 707 to crash on a scheduled domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight groups , " Van Epps explained , " because we had to cover all the bases . We could n't assume anything here . " Each group was assigned to a specific area ; each was headed by a CAB specialist , and each included representatives from such " interested parties " as The Boeing Company , American Airlines , the pilots ' union , the flight engineers ' association , and the Federal Aviation Agency . By 10:40 specialists to head up five of the groups , recruited from CAB headquarters in Washington , were speeding north . But even as they approached , new complications flared . Part of the job of the structures group is to document the exact position of each piece of wreckage . It is vital that nothing be moved until the CAB has noted its position . Yet now the police reported that human rertiains lay intertwined with the wreckage . Van Epps made the only decision possible . Removal of the dead came first . The structures group would have to make do as best it could . Struggling far past dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rescue workers found 60 bodies the first day . They also found a black leather grip containing 545,400 . Nearby was a gold clip with a 510,000 bill inside . Both belonged to W. Alton Jones , a onetime $45-per-month janitor who 'd risen to the chairmanship of the Cities Service Company . That morning he had been on his way to join his friend , former President Eisenhower , on a fishing trip . Now , as the bodies arrived at New York City 's morgue , Dr. Milton Helpern , the chief medical examiner , made a quick decision : He would not allow relatives to make visual identification . " It would have been inhumane , " he said later . The first body identified was that of Adm . Richard L. Conolly , 69 , wartime Navy hero and president of Long Island University . With 16 other passengers , he had planned to fly on United Airlines that morning and had switched to American only when United canceled its flight . The other bodies were not so readily recognizable . Helpem and his men examined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to victims ' homes and lift fingerprints off desk pads , venetian blinds and tubes of shaving cream to match what they had found in the wreckage . By Sunday evening , March 4 , 81 bodies had been recovered and 58 identified , Next morning skin divers pried into the cockpit area and found four more . It was Friday , March 9 , before the last of the bodies were removed . In any normal investigation the human-factors group conducts autopsies on the crew , looks for telltale signs of heart attacks , bullet wounds , carbon monoxide poisoning . There had been rumors that American I 's pilot , Capt . James T. Heist , a bushy-browed grandfather at 56 , had been suffering from a heart condition . Now group members pored anxiously over the crew 's medical records . They could find no clues . At the site , a 35-ton barge derrick was still trying to hoist out wreckage . On March 2 it snatched up an 8-by-10-foot section of the rudder : two days later it brought up the cockpit section . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sped them in guarded trucks to a vacant Swiss Air Lines hangar at Idlewiid . Inside , group members divided the wreckage into four areas : power plants , systems , structures and human factors . Watching it come in , struc tures-group chairman Coe Anderson , 35 , a stocky , balding former Navy pilot , felt dejected . His job now was to determine the exact position of each control surface and see whether something could have gone wrong with one of them in flight . Sometimes , at this point , a mock-up is made . Pieces of wreckage are stretched like broken eggshells over a wooden skeleton . But Anderson saw at a glance that a mock-up would be useless here . The magnesium and aluminum parts had burned fiercely and either disintegrated or fused . Besides , he had all he could do to decide which dents in the wreckage had been made by impact and which by firemen 's axes . In a homicide case any man brought to trial is presumed innocent until proven guilty . In an accident investigation , everything is suspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this crash several theories were proffered , several questions asked . Was there , for example , something fundamentally wrong with the 707 ? Like other high-performance jets , its shapely , swept-wing design gave it a tendency to yaw , or slip sideways . Could a yaw have turned into a roll ? Could the complex rudder boost system  --  similar to an automobile 's power steering  --  have gone haywire ? Did an aileron jam ? Was there fire prior to impact ? Frustrating ; Search for Cluesi Van Epps could only be sure that several things did not cause the crash . Among them : bad runways , bad weather and faulty air traffic control . " It was bad then , " recalls Dick Baker , the tall , crew-cut chairman of the operations group : " We did n't even know what we were looking for . " Slowly bits of information trickled in . The jet had emerged from Boeing 's assembly line three years earlier ; since then it had flown more than 8,000 hours . In January it had been flown to Boeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work required on all Astrojets . On February 9 the plane reentered service . On February 28 it flew from Tulsa to New York . Looking for clues , Baker checked with the last 12 pilots to fly the plane before Heist . None reported any abnormalities . He checked the jet 's takeoff path , walking down the runway searching for telltale nicks . He found nothing . Next he checked American 's maintenance records , discovered that early on March 1 two small mechanical " fixes " had been made . Both were routine . Meanwhile investigator Harold ( Porky ) Huyler was turning up some new and puzzling information . Reviewing the log book all flight crews keep , he found this notation for January 23 : " Rudder and elevator are too sensitive , " On January 28 : " Rudder kicks when boost is turned on ; nose goes to left . " That was all . But it was enough to make Baker feel his group was making progress . Then , a curious telephone call alerted him to a new possibility . The caller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesse Charles Wagner 11 . On the morning of March 1 , Wagner said , he 'd been listening to his ham radio at home , when he 'd heard someone shout that his cockpit was on fire and his plane out of control . Could that have been Captain Heist ? Although the theory sounded improbable , it had to be checked out . But when Baker asked for more details , the boy 's parents said that Jesse was studying for exams and did n't have time to talk . Angered , Bakerasked for FBI assistance . A special agent called on the Wagners . They agreed to cooperate . Several days later investigator Ivan Stracener sat in the lobby of a Philadelphia motel questioning the boy . Wagner seemed sincere enough , but there were too many holes in his story . Stracener told Van Epps about his doubts . The two of them decided to call on outside help . A few days later William Kiser of the Federal Communications Commission visited Wagner . With him was Capt . Howard Laughrey , an American Airlines pilot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the boy could n't have received a transmission from the jet . But this decision was n't reached officially until March 26 . And , until then , nobody could rule out the possibility . On March 9. skin divers found the flight recorder  --  a yellow , basketball-shaped device required on all jets  --  in nine feet of water . It appeared to be intact . Inside , technicians hoped , lay answers to questions about the jet 's speed , altitude . heading and G-forces . Carefully they opened it and extracted the holder . Their optimism fizzled ; it was crushed . That afternoon Van Epps sent the holder with a guard to the Bureau of Standards in Washington . There experts removed its thin aluminum tape . It was torn and crumpled and pocked with two large holes . Anxiously they concentrated on straightening what little they had , annealing the tape at 650 degrees just to smooth the bumps . Gradually they deciphered some secrets : airspeed. 220 knots ; altitude , 1,860 feet . Now they could be sure the jet had n't stalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a squiggle , then a return to normal flight , then everything went haywire at once . There the " readout " got fuzzy . " Try again , " Van Epps implored . On March 20 in New York , CAB member G. Joseph Minetti opened a public hearing into the crash . For four days witnesses described the condition of the airplane and its crew . The hearing brought out no new clues and only one intriguing piece of information : a tower controller 's statement that American l had waited 104 seconds after receiving takeoff clearance before beginning its roll . Could Captain Heist have spotted something wrong and tried to correct it in that time ? " We ca n't work with suppositions , " Van Epps explained . " We can only deal in facts that reduce the zone of uncertainty . " For systems-group chairman Wesley Cowan the zone of uncertainty was large indeed . There are more than five miles of wire and cabling on a 707 . The electrical , hydraulic and pneumatic equipment aboard a jet are complex . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men are born worriers . Cowan is one of them . A stubby , bespectacled , very earnest fellow , he likes accident investigation work ( " It pulls at every talent I 've got " ) , and he is an expert at his specialty . But he frets anyway . In the beginning he could n't be sure that fire had n't broken out prior to impact . It would have started in an area known as Lower 41 , the center of a jet 's electrical system , located beneath and to the rear of the captain 's seat . Chunks of metal from Lower 41 were found on top of other cockpit wreckage . They were charred . As Cowan worried about Lower 41 , the answer to the whole puzzle lay unnoticed on the hangar floor  --  hidden inside a device called a servo . On a jet , a servo 's main function is to move the control surfaces electronically when the autopilot is turned on . Each 707 has three servo units : one each for its ailerons , elevators and rudder . Salvage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far back as March 2 . But because its heavy black housing seemed undamaged , it had n't yet been examined . Nearly everything else had been checked . Painstakingly , Cowan and his group pried into what they considered suspect areas  --  they even spent a week tearing down radios to see if a fire could have started there . The Servo Looked Suspicious By March 26 they had turned up not a single clue . Now they gathered up the twisted hydraulic , electrical and autopilot components and flew with them to American Airlines ' maintenance base at Tulsa The schedule called for re-examination to see if anything had been overlooked . On March 29 Cowan put the three servos through standard 20-minute circuit tests . The elevator and aileron servos were OK . Then came the rudder unit . Suddenly he stopped . It did n't look quite right . Normally eight tiny wires lead from the rate generator to the yaw damper , a sensitive device that smooths abrupt rudder movements . Two of these eight wires were cut ; a third hung loosely by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ominous : three tiny puncture marks in the wires ' protective sleeving . What had caused them ? Now Jim Brough , an Australian aviation expert assigned by his government to follow the search , spotted something else . There  --  on the servo motor housing opposite the puncture marks  --  were several deep scratches . For the first time since March I Cowan felt he was onto something , Deliberately , he asked to see eight other servo units on American 's stock shelf . Six bore similar cuts and scratches ; one still carried the manufacturer 's seal . It had come from the Eclipse-Pioneer Division of the Bendix Corporation in Teterboro , New Jersey . Cowan called Washington immediately . " I was startled " he recalls . " We 'd been looking for something for so long and finding absolute zero . Then , all of a sudden , there it was . " By themselves the cut wires meant nothing . But open wires can reclose in the wrong way . If the wire ends had crossed , shooting 18 volts across a circuit designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicked  --  violently  --  and thrown the jet into an uncontrollable roll . The more Cowan theorized , the more this made sense . Now he remembered that the autopilot and yaw damper disconnect buttons just above the hand grips on the pilots ' control wheels had been found depressed . Both pilots had jammed their thumbs against the buttons as the jet screamed down . " They were analyzing it for us , " Cowan remarked , later . " We just did n't realize it for a while . " On April 4 at the Bendix plant in Teterboro Cowan confronted service manager Harold Peck with the damaged servo . Peck was skeptical . That servo , he pointed out , had been sent to Boeing in July , 1959 . Boeing had placed a hydraulic actuator , a fluid-boosting device with several valves , next to the servo . One of the valves could have stuck . Would this , then , have been Bendix 's responsibility ? Peck thought not . Besides , he ventured , who could he sure the puncture marks did n't stem from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line , Cowan and his group watched three craftsmen assemble servo units . On one man 's workbench lay a pair of tweezers . He had n't used them . Cowan asked why not . The man replied that he used them only now and then  --  when he wanted to reach between the sleeving and the motor housing and pull out a cord to wrap around the wires . " Show me how you do that , " Cowan asked . The man took the tweezers , reached down and squeezed . Cowan examined the sleeving . He saw no marks . Yet the tweezers still worried him . Photographs were taken . The spaces between the tweezer points precisely matched the spaces between the marks on the original wires . Soon afterward factory inspectors examined other servo units at the plant . Six of them had punctured sleeving , damaged wires and scratches on the housing . Pay dirt . But Cowan 's problems , far from being solved , were just beginning . When its investigators find something significant , the CAB must alert the Federal Aviation Agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on the information it gets from the CAB . But that is the extent of the FAA 's legal role . It is not allowed to muscle in on investigations or suggest probable causes of accidents . On April 5 the CAB relayed Cowan 's findings to the FAA . Next day , FAA 's George Prill sent wires to all airlines operating 707 's , suggesting that neither yaw damper nor autopilot be used below 5,000 feet . Hc added that , until flight tests could be held , the companies themselves should examine their autopilot systems , paying particular attention to the rudder servos . On April 14 the flight tests began at Idlewild . Their announced purpose was to review the noise-abatement turns and also to see whether a serious autopilot malfunction could be controlled by the crew . One top CAB official was invited to come along . He refused . " FAA was using a Boeing 720 , " he explained ; " the controls are fairly similar , but let 's he honest ; it 's just not the same airplane that American flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to like apples . " FAA 's tests also ignored other important details . For one thing , the agency tried to simulate the gross weight of Flight 1 simply by reducing their own jet 's engine thrust . Aerodynamically that 's impossible . Secondly , as the tests continued , the FAA simulated an autopilot malfunction by having their pilot shove his foot down hard on the rudder pedal . Predictably , the jet yawed and started to roll , but by this time the pilot had released the pedal and begun corrective action , Van Epps pointed out that iithe tests were to help the investigation at all , they had to duplicate the exact conditions existing on March 1 . This meant that  --  in order to take into account the element of surprise  --  the autopilot malfunction had to be triggered electronically . Van Epps even offered to pilot the jet himself during such a test . His offer was declined . " The net result , " he recalls , " was that I had to decide that we could n't accept the FAA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " These objections did n't seem to worry the FAA . At week 's end it concluded that " asymmetric forces generated by a runaway stabilizer , loss of two engines , seizure of the yaw damper , a jammed aileron or a split spoiler condition " could have been overcome by the crew . Furthermore , said its administrator , N. E. Halaby , the noise-abatement turn prescribed at Idlewild had nothing to do with the accident . In other words , according to the FAA. the severed wires Cowan had found in the servo unit were meaningless . The CAB was stunned . On April 17 CAB chairman Alan Boyd wrote Halaby , strongly recommending that FAA require an immediate and detailed examination of all rudder servos . Even as the letter left Boyd 's desk , a Boeing representative in Ireland was wiring back results of a check he 'd made on three Irish Airlines jets . No wires were cut , but there were scratches on several of the servos . In New York , meanwhile , a member of Cowan 's systems group was spot-checking jets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of them had servos with scratches and punctures . The IAA 's Recommendations Nevertheless , on April 20 the FAA recommended that the 5,000-foot altitude restriction it had placed on use of the yaw damper and autopilot now be lifted . " The hazards of the damaged wires mentioned in the April-sixth telegrams , " an agency spokesman explained , " were not as great as had been considered possible before the flight tests . . . . We determined that broken wires would not cause any appreciable control malfunction and that crossed wires could n't cause anything worse than an autopilot hard-over signal . Our tests showed this was controllable . " The FAA recommended : " While inspection of the servos is desirable , an electrical check is acceptable for units already installed in aircraft . " On May 11 Halaby answered Boyd 's letter . He declined to require a check on the servos . Meanwhile , Cowan continued his probe . On April 16 he went to Seattle , primarily to see how the entire autopilot system  --  with the hydraulic actuator that Boeing had added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to sec if a valve could have stuck -- thereby causing a hard-left rudder . When he returned on the 21st he was convinced that the suspect valve could have swallowed hunks of metal and still functioned properly . He was even more convinced that the tiny wires could have triggered the disaster . Slowly , the zone of his uncertainty was narrowing . But he still had to prove his theory . If Cowan was running into trouble , Coe Anderson of the structures group was equally beset . Because of the jet 's disintegration he had been forced to settle for a semimock-up . And in May , Swiss Air Lines decided to reclaim its hangar . Laboriously technicians crated the wreckage and sent it to Mitchel Field on Long Island . It remained there several weeks ; then  --  incredibly  --  it had to be moved again , this time to a vacant lot in Oceanside , Long Island . Meanwhile a new road block was springing up  --  one that would set the investigation back for several weeks . On June 4 , at a meeting in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his agency was set to alert the airlines about the dangers that might occur if a tiny bolt in the rudder boost package fell Free . On 707 's the bolt is installed upside down . A nut with a cotter pin through it secures it in place . If the bolt fell free , it could allow hydraulic fluid to gush into a valve , thus forcing the rudder hard over . At that point a jet could start a fatal roll . The theory sounded good , but there were several things wrong with it . Van Epps insisted that it was ridiculous to blame a bolt without having any hard evidence . And the bolt itself was still missing . Boeing said it had already alerted the airlines to the situation and on four occasions suggested inspection . The CAB and Boeing both asked Prill to reconsider . But he was adamant . On June 12 he issued what is known in aviation as an alert bulletin . It is usually sent through channels . Instead , Prill held a press conference , The CAB was not invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's disclaimer that the bolt theory was a " possibility , repeat , possibility " ; despite his admission that CAB was still in charge of the investigation , newsmen bit hard on what he had to say , splashed the " probable cause " on page 1 . Van Epps felt the bolt could not have caused the disaster for several reasons . Had it slipped out , it would have flipped the jet over onto its back quickly . Witnesses reported that the fatal roll was gradual . Second , tests proved there was still pressure on the rudder hydraulic-boost gauge at impact . If the bolt had fallen out , fluid would have rushed against the rudder boost ; the pressure would have dropped . Third , if the bolt had dropped out , where had it gone ? The reason it was installed upside down was because there was no space in the hydraulic feed line . There was hardly enough room for it to slip away . Yet the onus was still on the CAB to find the bolt . No one knew how much time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That FAA announcement , " growled Van Epps in a classic understatement , " irritated some of our people . " The search began anew on June 13 while most of the wreckage was still at Mitchel . Investigators examined and shook every single piece of metal . They X-rayed fused and melted chunks , finding nothing even resembling the bolt . So they turned to Army mine detectors , covering more than 50,000 square feet of sand near the crash site . They found the equivalent of two garbage cans full of metal . But they did n't find the bolt . Late in June Van Epps sent a barge to the impact hole . Its crew labored there until July 10 . Three weeks later Van Epps substituted a dredge designed to suck up tiny pieces of debris from deep in the silt . It did n't work too well . The crew spent half their time pulling up raw seaweed . Next came a derrick . It scooped up half a cubic yard of silt at a time , dumped it on a screen where eight men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrels full of metal and two decomposed feet . But no bolt . By early September two more zones of uncertainty had been reduced . The structures group could say that it had found no evidence of a jammed aileron or a stuck spoiler  --  a control device on a 707 's upper wing which is often used to facilitate turns and landings . Furthermore , the bolt theory had been pretty well discredited . On September 5 Van Epps flew to Seattle to check the results of some flight tests Boeing had made and , importantly , to see if Boeing followed his theory concerning the severed wires . In the conference room at Seattle Van Epps listened patiently as company test pilots described " some of the wild things " Boeing had done with a 707 to help the investigation . During one flight test , a pilot triggered the autopilot and yaw-damper malfunction electronically . The plane banked all the way over to 56 degrees , but the crew was able to recover after four seconds with no difficulty . Boeing now felt any alert flight crew could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then Van Epps added the rub . " In your tests , " he said , " the plane was subjected to a one-G loading . Let 's suppose you pushed the nose up enough to increase those G-forces to 1.4 ? the same as they were on American I. Would that have made any difference ? " " Alt , " said one pilot , " your recovery capability would be much less . Unless the crew recognized what was happening , they could be in trouble . " Gradually , as they talked , they could imagine what probably had happened to Captain Heist that dreadful morning . The wires had crossed . The yaw damper had kicked the rudder ; because the plane was in a climbing bank , Heist had temporarily lost all visual reference to the ground ; it was impossible for him to sense the sudden yaw . By the time he knew something was wrong , it was much too late to do anything . Now all that remained was detail . By October 1 Van Epps finished his written report . In Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , last week , it entered the public record . What did it all prove ? Already the search has resulted in several tiny improvements which can make flying safer for the average traveler . Today at ldlewild , for example , jet pilots do n't begin that first turn until they 've reached 1,000 feet . New rules governing engagement of the yaw damper and autopilot have been issued , and the procedures governing installation of the tiny wires have been altered to prohibit use of the tweezers . The bolts that caused so much commotion have been checked , and all the servo units have been studiously examined . The investigation may have been helpful , too , insofar as it shed piercing light on what the Seattle Times called the disturbing specter of " one government agency . . . attempting to usurp the authority of another and undermining public confidence in air transportation while doing so . " Roundly criticized from all quarters , the FAA soon retreated back into its own bailiwick . As the search ended , Van Epps took a vacation in the Berkshires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his thoughts . " This was one of the toughest cases I 've ever seen ; for a long while just could n't believe it  --  a tiny , insignificant wire like that smashing such a great big airplane . Who 'd have thought it could happen that way ? " In its own sad , irreversible fashion , " he adds solemnly , " every disaster contributes to our knowledge ; every disaster teaches us something . You follow me ? "
