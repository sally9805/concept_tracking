At quarter past noon every working day , half a dozen agents from London 's three big bullion dealers meet in the teak-paneled board room of Sharps , Pixley &; Co. , for a gentlemanly haggle that sets the price of silver in Britain-and much of the rest of the world . Last week every one of the agents was saying the same : " I 'm a buyer-not a seller . " With that , the price of silver hit a 42-year record of $1.14 per oz. in London , also advanced to $1.13 in New York City , which is the world 's other major market . <P> Behind silver 's spectacular rise lay two major causes . Demand for silver now exceeds new supply largely because of the rapid expansion of industrial uses for the metal in electronics , aerospace and photography ( for film emulsions ) . Last year the free world consumed 351 million oz. , but new production was only 211 million oz . On top of this , the U.S. Government last fall stopped its longtime practice of selling silver from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the U.S. had set the price at 91 to support silver , but the heavy demand of recent years had turned the floor into a ceiling , and so the U.S. scrapped it . <P> Where prices go next depends largely upon Mexico , which last year produced one-fifth of the free world 's new supply of silver and is also a big hoarder of the metal . Last week the Mexicans , acting to hold the price at $1.13 , were cautiously selling from their reserves . They were fearful that if the price went much higher , Red China might start dumping its reputedly large hoard and thereby crack the market .
