Housed in a compact building near Boulogne , France , a row of 10-ft. - high steel cylinders feeds high-voltage electricity into cables that cross under the English Channel to link the power networks of two nations . The same sort of tubes will soon be at work in New Zealand and Japan , and the U.S. Department of the Interior hopes to hook them to a pair of 750,000-volt lines more than 800 miles long that will carry surplus hydroelectric power from the Pacific Northwest to consumers in California and Arizona . <P> For all their size , the power-pushing cylinders are first cousins of the fragile vacuum tubes that glow in TV and hi-fi sets . But for all their futuristic appearance , they are a long reach into the past . They deal in electricity that always flows in the same direction-the same direct current that Thomas Alva Edison used in 1882 when he built his first primitive power system in downtown New York . <P> Slim Cables . Alternating current , which changes direction some 60 times per second , is far more versatile because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cheap transformers . Modern generating plants produce AC at comparatively low voltage , and for long-distance transmission , transformers step it up to several hundred thousand volts so that it will pass through cables of reasonable size without too much loss. * When it reaches its destination , transformers reduce the voltage for use in homes and industries . <P> Despite DC 's virtual disappearance from general use , engineers have lived with the nagging knowledge that oneway current is better for the longer hauls . DC transmission lines carry more power and are cheaper to build . Their smooth stream of electricity is easier to control and to blend with current from other sources in a network . Trouble is , DC can not be handled by transformers ; what was needed to fit it for the big-time was a practical method of manufacturing it from high-voltage AC current at the generator end of the line , and of converting it back to AC at the customers ' end . <P> Steady Flow . This is the job that has been taken over by the big steel cylinders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Dr. Uno Lamm of Sweden 's ASEA company , they are filled with hot mercury vapor and act like instantaneous switches . High-voltage AC from step-up transformers runs into them , and whenever the current changes its direction , it is switched to the opposite pole of a DC transmission line . A bank of valves switching in unison produces a steady flow of current . <P> At the far end of the transmission line , the same valves are used in a different hookup . The current flowing through their mercury vapor is stopped and started by a control-voltage applied to a grid . This second switching produces alternating current that can be fed into transformers and reduced to the low voltages needed by the customers . <P> <P> * When the voltage ( electric pressure ) of a transmission system is increased , its amperage ( current ) is reduced proportionately and there is less energy loss in the line .
