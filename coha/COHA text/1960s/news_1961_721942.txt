txt Senator Barry Goldwater said today that he would like to see the welfare program of Newburgh , N. Y. , adopted by every city in the country . The Arizona Republican endorsed Newburgh 's stringent thirteen-point welfare code after having met with Newburgh City Manager Joseph . Mitchell . Mr. Mitchell , meanwhile , was informed that the New York Social Welfare Board had asked Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz to take legal action to block the code and that the Solicitor General had been assigned to investigate . He said he welcomed the investigation . " I have no qualms about the Attorney General coming in , " he said . " We have not violated any laws . " Senator Goldwater , leader of the Republican party 's conservative wing , said that there was nothing political about Mr. Mitchell 's plan . He described his meeting with the city manager as " one American 's admiration for another to protect my taxes . " The Senator declared , " I do n't like to see my taxes paid for children born out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional chiselers walking up and down the streets who do n't work and have no intention of working . " I would like to see every city in the country adopt the plan . " Mr. Goldwater 's comment that the Newburgh plan was nonpolitical was apparently a reference to Governor Rockefeller of New York , who is mentioned as a possible opponent of Mr. Goldwater for the Presidential nomination in 1964 . Mr. Rockefeller is opposed to Mr. Mitchell 's welfare code , fearing it might be a violation of Federal-state laws that would deprive New York of $200,000,000 in annual Federal welfare benefits . Mr. Goldwater said he had endorsed Mr. Mitchell 's plan before Governor Rockefeller had taken his position . Mr. Mitchell 's meeting with the Senator was the high point of his dawn-to-dusk schedule to build support for the Newburgh welfare plan . The 39-year-old city official predicted that Mr. Lefkowitz investigation would lead to an injunction designed to prevent Newburgh from carrying out the welfare program . Earlier he said that New York State and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state and the N. A. A. C. P. were trying to discredit the welfare plan both " racially and statistically . " The N. A. A. C. P. contends that the welfare plan is aimed at discriminating against Negroes . Nearly half of the city 's 900 to 1,400 persons on the welfare rolls are Negroes , Mr. Mitchell said . Mr. Mitchell 's plan also won the endorsement today of Senator John G. Tower , the first Republican elected from Texas since Reconstruction days . The city manager said he had come to Washington on " official " business at the invitation of Senators Tower and Goldwater . Meanwhile Representative Samuel S. Stratton , Democrat of upstate New York , accused Governor Rockefeller of " running out " on the Newburgh controversy by going on a trip to Venezuela . Mr. Stratton said Governor Rockefeller had made his position on how to handle welfare cases clear months ago by stating that we was " all for a strong liberal position  --  no residency laws or anything else . " He said Mr. Rockefeller 's statement came at Binghamton , N. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge when he came to it " on whether Newburgh was doing anything illegal on welfare laws . Before leaving for home , Mr. Mitchell said Senators Jacob K. Tavits and Kenneth B. Keating , both Republicans , were " sympathetic " with Newburgh 's problems . However , he said , , they stopped short of endorsing , the welfare plan . Both Senators said they , wanted to make sure that New ! York was not deprived of any Federal welfare funds because of the Newburgh program . Senator Goldwater said that he had no reservations about any aspect of the thirteen-point iwelfare code . i He also said that his endorsemerit of the Newburgh program ! had " nothing- to do with the Rockefeller-Goldwater " political competition . At least one New York State ! Democrat , Sears Hunter , Democratic chairman of Orange County , said Mr. Goldwater 's approval of the welfare code was a move to undermine Govlernor Rockefeller 's chances for the Republican Presidential nomination in 1964 . He said he believed the move had been " or'ganized in Washington and de- , signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
