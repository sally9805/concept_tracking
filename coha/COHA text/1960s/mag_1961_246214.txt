When the F.L.N. called for a general strike to protest talk of partitioning Algeria , even the French expected the worst . Jacques Coup de Frjac , France 's chief press officer in Algeria , bluntly acknowledged that " support for the rebellion can not grow any more-it is total , " adding that Moslems would " gladly " follow the strike order " ioo% . " Last week Algeria 's Moslems proved that he was right . <P> On the day of the strike . Algeria lay eerie and still , chilling Europeans into renewed awareness of their dependence on the Moslems who served them as cooks and maids , clerks and mechanics . The French had warned that they would fire on demonstrators , but in seaboard villages flanking Algiers , the Moslems demonstrated anyway , sometimes led by uniformed jellagha . In Constantine , thousands of Moslems flung themselves against massed French troops . By strike 's end , there were 14 French casualties , 88 Moslem dead . <P> As if proof were needed , the strike was convincing testimony that it was time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the Evian talks were broken off . De Gaulle has given up talk of a French-run plebiscite , which was at best a wistful hope that pro-French Moslems might vote for some alternative to the F.L.N. He has become convinced , as Coup de Frejac had blurted , that support for the F.L.N. is total , and that the F.L.N. will rule the new Algeria . The only question is : On what terms ?
