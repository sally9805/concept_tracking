Carney Love was 42 , a slight and pretty woman , with two grown children and a record of generally good health ; it was nothing more than bleeding gums from a recent tooth extraction that led her doctor , John Wolf of Redding , Calif. , to give her the potent antibiotic Chloromycetin . She got the drug again six weeks later for bronchitis-eight prescriptions in all , counting renewals . <P> Now Mrs. Love 's face is beet-red and scarred with acne , and she has to shave daily . She has muscles like a male athlete 's . Doctors warn that because Mrs. Love has a tendency to bleed heavily , she can not risk a cut or undergo ordinary surgery . A fortnight ago . a jury awarded her $334,046 in damages from Dr. Wolf and Parke . Davis &; Co. , the drug 's manufacturers . Her case , the first of its type to go to a jury , dramatized what are laconically called the " side effects " of many valuable drugs , and the problems of balancing a drug 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she took Chloromycetin late in 1958 , Mrs. Love felt weak and went to another doctor , who diagnosed aplastic anemia , in which the bone marrow fails to make enough blood cells . Her husband sold his business , the Beer Barrel Tavern outside Redding , to pay for her care , including 60 transfusions . At Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital Center , the transfusions and vigorous treatment with cortisone and testosterone kept Mrs. Love among the 25% of patients who get aplastic anemia and survive , but the hormones produced their own side effects . Though Chloromycetin causes these severe reactions in only one of an estimated 10,000 patients , Mrs. Love 's attorney charged that Dr. Wolf had been negligent in prescribing it for such minor ailments . Dr. Wolf replied that many physicians were using it at the time for a wide range of infections , and he had not been sufficiently warned about its dangers . <P> Pros over Cons .

It attacked many bacteria against which penicillin was useless , notably the typhoid bacillus ; equally important , it was the first effective drug against psittacosis ( caused by an unusually large virus ) and against such diseases as typhus , scrub typhus and spotted fever ( caused by related microbes called rickettsiae ) . Not until 1952 , when hundreds of thousands of patients had had the drug-often for viral respiratory infections against which neither it nor any other antibiotic is effective-did evidence arise that it had caused a dozen or more cases , several fatal , of aplastic anemia . <P> The FDA got the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts to study Chloromycetin.
