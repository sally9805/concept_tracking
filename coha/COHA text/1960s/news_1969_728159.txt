txt The United States Senate is a body of men who ponder long and hard about possible conflicts of interest on the part of judges , as they should , but entrust their tax reform program to a member who regularly makes far more money on tax-free oil royalties than he gets in salary  --  and five times as much on oil royalties altogether . - Since 1964 , Senator Russell Long of Louisiana has enjoyed a total tax-free income of over $300,000 by virtue of a depletion allowance for the oil industry . Now as chairman of the Finance Committee , he is in charge of a tax bill which , among other changes , contemplates the reduction of that allowance by 71/2 per cent . When oil industry witnesses argue that a reduction would be " a breach of faith by Congress , " the Senator solemnly agrees . He has no qualms about conflict of interest , thanks to a novel theory : " If you have financial interests completely parallel to your state , then you have no problem . " By this reasoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while deriving their principal income from the automobile industry , or Pennsylvania Senators from coal or steel , or Floridians from grapefruit , respectively to represent those interests in Con- - gress rather than the people of their states , with all their varied and conflicting needs . Rejecting this theory entirely , onemay nevertheless appreciate the difficulty of putting some check on con- . flict of interest , even in so extreme a form as Senator Long 's . If he can proclaim his personal stake in the oil industry and still serve as a committee chairman in charge of taxing it , then financial disclosure , even if it is made much more stringent than present regulations demand , hardly answers the problem . But clearly it is prerequisite to more basic reforms . Unlike judges , members of Congress should  --  and as a general proposition , must  --  vote on all issues before them . As the late Senator Robert Kerr of Oklahoma ( who himself had major economic interests in fields in which he - avidly legislated ) observed , " If everyone abstained on the grounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quorum in the United States Senate on any subject . " But there is good reason why a member should not be allowed to serve on committees which are overwhelmingly concerned with matters bearing directly on his main source of income . Yet there is no restraint on such needless conflict . Senator Eastland of Mississippi , who has received more than $100,000 a year for three consecutive years in agricultural subsidies , sits on the Agriculture Committee and regularly votes for such subsidies . Representative Brown of Ohio , holding the majority stock in a broadcasting station , had no qualms- about opposing educational radio and television from his vantage place on the House subcommittee which processes all broadcasting legislation : And these cases , like Senator Long 's , are typical rather than unique . Senator Cook of Kentucky has pointed the way to a substantially more ethical Congress- Revealing his interest in the Bank of Louisville , he asked , upon entering the Senate , that he not be appointed to the Banking and Currency Committee . If other members were required to make such declaration and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical way , if not to make the atmosphere over Capitol Hill completely pure , at least to improve it substantially .
