When neighborhoods go down , even the best schools usually follow . Such might have been the future for Kansas City 's venerable Central High School . Founded in 1887 , it was long the city 's top all-white school , usually sent half its graduates to college , boasted among its alumni Actor William Powell , Singer Gladys Swarthout , and even baseball 's redoubtable Casey Stengel . But after World War II , Central 's once prosperous white neighborhood rapidly turned black . When Central integrated in 1955 , racial tension reached such a pitch that police cars haunted the premises . One sergeant predicted " a lot worse situation here than they had in Little Rock . " <P> <P> The prediction was wrong . One of the reasons is a cadre of dedicated white teachers whose careers go back to the 1920s-old hands such as Biology Teacher Rebekah Leibengood , English Teacher Virginia Oldham and Coach Harry Slaymaker . Instead of deserting , they stayed on to join several gifted Negro teachers in saving Central . Explains veteran Guidance Counselor Hortense Schaller : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not willing to accept the idea that because a child comes from a less favorable environment he ca n't make it . We have not given in one iota . " <P> Racists &; Razors . The decision to maintain standards has been a long uphill fight . Soon after integration , white and Negro students began living by gangland rule . Bullies of both races extorted nickels and dimes from younger students ; when arguments started , the races closed ranks . To prevent gang fights , teachers patrolled the lavatories , frisked pupils for razors , switchblades , and beer can openers with honed edges . Though officials hushed up the mess for three years , the lid blew off in 1958 , when young Negro toughs beat up two white teachers . White students fled the school , and few dreamed that it would ever be good again . Said one teacher as he quit combustible Central : " They do n't pay me enough for that . " <P> As Central moved to its present ratio of 90% Negro , tension lessened . " You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says able Principal James Boyd , who took over in 1959 . " When you have a definite majority , it reduces friction . " But that only half explains the story . Even in the majority , Central 's Negro students were often dispirited youngsters with little academic ambition . Central had to make them want to learn , and it did .
