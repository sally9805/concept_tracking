Massachusetts ' top Republicans , for a change , approach the November elections as odds-on favorites . Governor John Volpe , 57 , now in his second term in office , has been one of the state 's most effective and most popular chief executives . By any realistic standard , he is considered all but unbeatable for reelection . And Attorney General Edward Brooke , 46 , a Negro , seems likely to win the U.S. Senate seat of Republican Brahmin Leverett Saltonstall , 74 , who is retiring next January after 22 years in office . <P> Brooke , one of the most successful vote getters in Massachusetts history , will be opposed by Endicott ( " Chub " ) Peabody , 46 , an unimpressive if well-meaning former Governor who was ignominiously defeated for nomination by his own Lieutenant Governor in the 1964 primary . This year Peabody won the Democratic nomination after a bruising battle with Boston 's two-term mayor , John Collins , 47 , an icy pragmatist whose political strength is based largely in the city , where he has mounted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a polio victim who is usually confined to a wheelchair , relied extensively on well-delivered television oratory and made an attempt to attract white-backlash votes by pointedly rejecting " civil disobedience as a means of attaining democratic objectives . " Chub Peabody tirelessly stumped the state , chopping away at Collins ' " public-be-damned " redevelopment program and recounting his own liberal record as Governor . Responding sympathetically to Peabody 's image of ingenuous honesty , the voters gave him 321,035 votes to 265,213 for Collins . A third candidate , Boston Brahmin Thomas Boylston Adams , mounted an antiwar campaign , but got only 51,483 votes . <P> <P> Volpe 's opponent in November will be Edward J. McCormack , 43 , nephew of U.S. House Speaker John McCormack , who is widely known in the state - partly because he was an able attorney general ( 1958-63 ) , but mostly because of his bitter , unsuccessful struggle with Teddy Kennedy for the senatorial nomination in 1962 . In the primary , McCormack easily defeated Kenny O'Donnell , 42 , one of John Kennedy 's top White House political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was little known to rank-and-file voters . It will be a different story when McCormack takes on Volpe.
