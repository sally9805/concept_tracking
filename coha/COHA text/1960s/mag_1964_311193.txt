No one has heard much about movies like Breath-Death , Cosmic Ray , and Stone Sonata , but now the Ford Foundation has begun pouring tuns of gold on the happy heads of the people who made them . The foundation has decided to encourage the art of film as practiced by lone stylists whose pictures are usually brief , almost always 16-mm. , and sometimes comprehensible only to themselves . <P> Accordingly , Ford sought a list of 177 candidates , invited them to send sample films , then picked twelve winners . Most got $10,000 . The total grant was $118,500 . <P> Presumably , the foundation screened all the pictures they prized , but viewed collectively , the winning films are a varietal riot . Some are mad , some methodical . Some are suitable for the living room and others for a smoker at the Elks . This one is conventional . That one is wildly experimental . This honest . That phony . How one panel of judges could have agreed on the twelve grantees defeats the unfoundationed imagination . <P> Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tireless man with scissors . He cuts pictures out of magazines-all kinds of magazines-and stirs them into film clips in a kind of stiff puppet action that writes a curious chapter in the manual of animation . In Skulduggery , Harry Truman comes popping out of the mouth of a sumptuous girl ; then a hammer comes out of her nose and knocks Harry back between her chops . Breath-Death shows Harpo Marx playing his harp on the edge of a smoking battlefield . Khrushchev appears , sneezes , and Hitler pops up and says Gesundheit . A Merlin-like figure suddenly gets stuck in the back of the neck with a flying table fork . A nude appears , with two small skulls where her breasts should be . Another girl lies in bed caressing a TV set on the pillow beside her . Reading downbed from the TV set is a spread-out man 's shirt and a pair of trousers . Kind of anemic , this lover , but what a fat head . <P> In all , Vanderbeek showed Ford three of his five-to-ten-minute " Visible Fill'ms " - each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give away would instantly grasp . In A La Mode , for example , a girl carries her breasts on a tray with miscellaneous fruits . An automobile drives up hill and down dale across a pair of giant breasts . A woman 's face comes off , revealing an opera . house inside her head . A bird comes out of a pore in her back . <P> Vanderbeek , a New Yorker now heading upstate , is about to move his wife and two children into a house he is making out of old water tanks . " I think the film 's only hope is experimental cinema , " he says . " The whole commercial cinema of neoreality is fundamentally pornographic and does not contribute to one 's soul . It is not sensitive . The cinema needs people of private vision . We are living in an avalanche of entertainment fallout , and how does one survive when bombarded by clumsy ideas ? The film should be in the hands of poets rather than just slick , literate stylists . "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
