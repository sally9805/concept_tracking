For a while he had one pledged delegate , 666 short of the total he would need to win the Republican presidential nomination . Then he released the one he had . His national campaign staff numbers seven . After Robert Kennedy 's murder , he was assigned a few Secret Service guards , which prompted a Congressman 's quip : " It 's the biggest crowd he 's had this campaign . " Not even his wife accompanies him on his campaign . Yet he persists . He is Harold Stassen , who quadrennially offers up his obsession on the public altar-where it is scorned . <P> Once Stassen was the boy wonder-a county attorney at 23 , Governor of Minnesota at 31 , Republican Convention keynoter ( in 1940 ) at 33 , as well as floor manager for Wendell Willkie . His own cause peaked in 1948 when he scored impressive victories in the Wisconsin and Nebraska presidential primaries , only to be overwhelmed in Oregon by New York 's Tom Dewey . Since then , his course has been downhill . Now 61 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His current slogan is STASSEN ' 68-WHY NOT ? A better question is : Why ? <P> Implacable as a Tank . " I 've always believed in issues rather than partisanship , " he says . But the issues he espoused-a blend of mild liberalisms-have long since been appropriated by candidates who sometimes win . " It 's been a lifetime commitment to do everything I could to secure peace , " he says , emphasizing his role as a U.S. delegate to the 1945 San Francisco conference that forged the United Nations , and as Ike 's Mutual Security Administrator and chief disarmament adviser . Even as he recalls such distinguished assignments , he unconsciously reminds his audiences that his day is past . <P> Yet Stassen , according to friends , is as implacable " as a medium tank . " Ponderous and humorless , he travels the country by airliner and rented cars to confront an electorate that does not care . To him , running for President seems to be somewhere between a hobby and a quirk . " He has this blind spot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows more than anybody . " <P> In deceptively reasonable tones , Stassen retorts : " I realize the small power I have within the G.O.P. , but I have confidence I can win in November . " He is used to derision , he says . " I steel myself . I 've been in the center and out , and back . This is part of my life . " It is an utterly quixotic part , at best , and scarcely rational , but he is determined to play it to its lonely end .
