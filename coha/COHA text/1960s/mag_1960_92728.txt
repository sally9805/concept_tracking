We have one loss , but they have two . " The speaker was Fullback Jim Taylor of the Green Bay Packers and he referred to the Baltimore Colts . The Packers , leaders of the Western Division with a 4 and 1 record , were in Baltimore to play the Colts Sunday , and the Colts , as every Baltimorean knew , were off to a slow 4 and 2 start in quest of their third straight league title . The thick , gloomy sky covering the city the day before the game seemed symbolic . " Sunday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those days for the Colts . Otherwise , they are through as champions . " // The Colts were grimly incommunicado on Saturday , holding morning practice in secrecy . The Packers flew in after noon and were chipper as breakfast hostesses as they chattered their way through drills in Memorial Stadium . Coach Vince Lombardi , who had patched up the Packers and inspired them into a surprising 7 and 5 record last year ( they had been a horrible 1-10-1 in pre-Lombardi 1958 ) , arrived smiling . Rosy-cheeked Dominic ( " Call me Ole " ) Olejniczak , a realtor who serves as payless Packer president , beamed becomingly at anyone who would look back at him , though he privately admitted to butterflies . The players were confident : one of the Colt losses was a 35-21 defeat administered by the Packers at Green Bay in early October . True , the Packers were outgained ( 245 yards to 435 ) , but they had played alertly and aggressively , intercepting four passes by Johnny Unitas and grabbing two Colt fumbles. // This last Sunday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the law of irony ) caught Green Bay . This second game was almost an exact reverse of the first . This time the Packers outgained the Colts ( 426 yards to 404 ) , but the Colts intercepted four passes by Bart Starr and grabbed two Packer fumbles to win 38-24. // In retrospect , one could see that the Packer pattern of defeat was set shortly after the Colts kicked off . With Halfback Paul Hornung sweeping right end and Taylor and End Gary Knafelc receiving , the Packers moved to the Colt 15 . There , however , on third down and with eight yards to go , Colt Halfback Milt Davis intercepted a pass meant for Knafelc . Davis caught the ball on the two and ran it out to the 10  --  far enough out so that Johnny Unitas felt free to pass . To the screams of the usual full crowd of 58,000 , Unitas began throwing to the outside of the oncoming Packer line , first to End Ray Berry on the left , then to Halfback Lenny Moore , flanked to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their experienced defensive right halfback , had to leave the game ( he returned only briefly in the second half ) . Whittenton had slipped on the stadium turf and pulled a muscle in Saturday 's practice , and now he had aggravated his injury to the point where it caused him pain . " He Just could n't run , " Lombardi said afterward . " From the way things looked , maybe we should have kept him in . " In Whittenton 's place , Lombardi used two rookies , first Willie Wood , then Dick Pesonen . Neither was ready for the assignment of handling Berry and Halfback Alex Hawkins . Before the game was over , Unitas had thrown four touchdown passes in their direction . " To put a rookie in , and to put him in against Berry and Unitas , and in Baltimore , too , well , that 's too much pressure , " Lombardi said . " Of course , " he added quickly , " that 's to take nothing away from Berry and Unitas. " // In any event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Colts had the ball , second and one on the Packer 45 . Unitas set about immediately to exploit his good fortune . He fell back behind a bushel of blockers , faked to Berry breaking inside ( " to draw the halfback in , " Unitas explained later ) , paused , then hit Berry , who had cut back to the sideline , on the 10 . Completely alone , he caught the ball and scored . // The Colts suddenly struck again . Steve Myhra kicked off to the Packers . Halfback Tom Moore , the Packers ' first draft choice for 1960 , took the ball in the end zone and headed out . But at the 20 he was met so hard that the ball squirted from his hands . It landed on the 24 , where Myhra , of all people , pounced on it . // The Packers dug in . They slammed into Unitas . Then the Colts lost 15 for holding . All of a sudden , the Packers had the Colts back on the 50 , third and 36 yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all afternoon , called a pass play known as " the flea flicker . " // Unitas handed off to Fullback Billy Pricer on what looked like a draw . Pricer ran toward the line , then lateraled back to Unitas . Meanwhile , Hawkins , who had faked the defensive man out of position by pretending he was going to block for the run that Pricer never made , sprinted down the left sideline . " I went down until I did n't think Johnny could throw that far , " Hawkins said . " I slowed down , then I went running after it again , like an outfielder misjudging a fly ball . " Hawkins lunged for the ball , caught it and fell forward on the one . Two plays later he scored on a pass from Unitas. // The Colts kept up the tempo . Ordell Braase and Johnny Sample raced into the Packer backfield to block a field-goal attempt by Hornung . The Colts took over on their own 30 and moved to the 21 where Unitas passed to Berry in the end zone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career . // Green Bay got a touchdown when Starr passed twice to End Max McGee , and Taylor tore through the line from the four . // The Packers continued to fight back in the third period . Bill Forester intercepted on the Colt 40 . " Unitas said he just did n't see the linebacker , " Coach Weeb Ewbank said . Taylor , carrying and receiving , brought the ball to the 14 , where Hornung ran around left end for the score . // The Colts were forced to kick from their 27 . Wood took the ball on his own 27 and slithered and dodged his way to the Colt 30 as the crowd groaned . But there was a flag on the play . The Packers were penalized for a personal foul and put back on their own 13 . Sample intercepted . The Colts lost the ball on a fumble , but then got it right back when the Packers fumbled . The Colts stalled and settled for a field goal , making the score 24-14. // Still Green Bay came back in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the middle . Taylor carried to the two , and Hornung dove in for the touchdown . Five minutes later , Hornung , the league 's leading scorer , made it 24  --  all with a goal from the 21 . The Packers , who had been down 21-0 in the second quarter , now had it tied . But the Colts had Unitas and Berry and Moore , and the Packers were without Whittenton. // With the crowd urging him on ( " C'm on , Johnny , get us one ! Just one ! " ) , Unitas began throwing low line drives to Berry and Moore . From the Packer 16 , Unitas hit Berry on the sideline at the eight . For one frozen moment Berry appeared to stand still as Pesonen dove at him , but at the last instant Berry twisted away and ran down the line for the tie-breaking touchdown . That play was the game . " He would n't have done that on Whittenton , " Ewbank said later , breaking into a smile . // Behind 31-24 , only two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Halfback Bob Boyd , who had n't been doing too well until then , intercepted and ran the ball to the Packer 14 . The crowd screamed its approval , and so did Colt Backfield Coach Charlie Winner , on the phone up in the press box . " That , " said Winner , " makes up for the boners he made . " // On the first play Hawkins took a handoff and ran straight through the Packers . The kick was good , and the Colts led 38-24 with only 1:54 left . // Superfluously , the Colts intercepted again . This time it was Davis who took the ball on the Colt 28 . There was not time left to score again . The crowd , like a college cheering section , counted the closing seconds  --  " Five ! Four ! Three ! Two ! One ! "  --  as kids ran out on the field to hail their heroes . // The most mistakes // In his office Ewbank sipped a Royal Crown Cola as he accepted congratulations . " They had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hawkins made a fine catch . " He exulted over the flea flicker . " I had that in high school , " he said . " It is n't worth a damn when it does n't work ! // " Both teams played a fine ball game , " Ewbank went on . " They 're tough  --  we could n't contain them up there . But the team that makes the most mistakes loses . " Did this win , asked a reporter , mean that the Colts would win another championship ? Ewbank frowned . " If I knew that , " he said , " it would save me a hell of a lot of gray hairs . All I 'm thinking about is the Bears . " The Colts play the Bears Sunday in Chicago , and outside in the dressing room , where the players were slapping one another on the back , someone had chalked on the blackboard , FIVE TO GO  --  BEARS NEXT . It seems like a good bet .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
