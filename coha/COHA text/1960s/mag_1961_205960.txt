The notion that much of the Bible is myth has long been held by some Protestant theologians , including the U.S. 's Paul Tillich and Germany 's Rudolf Bultmann . <P> But this has rarely been stated flatly by a bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church . For so saying , San Francisco 's Bishop James A. Pike has been accused of heresy by some of his fellow Episcopalians . While Pike , an ex-lawyer and a convert from Roman Catholicism , has a well-demonstrated talent for starting controversy and making news , the issues at stake are real and deep . <P> Allergic Reaction . Pike first stated his views in the Christian Century , was attacked by 15 Episcopal ministers in Georgia and critics elsewhere , then turned on his critics in a pastoral letter . Pike placed heavy emphasis on the freedom of the Anglican Communion . " We , unlike most principal Christian traditions , are not bound to a particular set of concepts or form of words . . . It is true that we have a rather skimpy set of propositions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Articles of Religion ; but they are not a Confession of Faith ; they represent the allergic reaction of our Church to ' papists ' on the one hand and ' puritans ' on the other at a singular point in our history . . . Actually we take seriously the views of theologians and synods of all centuries - and precisely because we ' sit loose ' to all of them . " <P> The Gospel , said Bishop Pike , is largely communicated by means of myth-not in the sense of an untrue fable ( " A good myth is true " ) , but in the sense of a form used to express complicated and difficult truth , such as the Garden of Eden . Writes Pike : " I do not know a single member of the Anglican Communion-Bishop , presbyter , deacon or layman-who believes this story literally . " <P> Another myth , set forth in the creed , is the idea that Christ " ascended into Heaven . " Pike asks " Where ? We no longer believe in a three-level universe : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And as for ' sitteth on the right hand of the Father , ' I simply remind you that in certain Oriental areas of the Church the phrase is ' on the left hand of the Father , ' since in their cultures the latter is the place of honor . " <P> Package v. Product . The virgin birth is a myth , Pike feels , designed to communicate the simultaneous humanity and divinity of Christ ; so is the thorny theological concept of the Trinity . " The packaging is not to be confused with the product . . . For example , 4th century church leaders , imbued with a dated Greek philosophy , tried to organize God 's revelation of himself into categories which thoughtful people of that time could grasp . They did a good job . They gathered up God 's true revelation of Himself as Creator ( we might say ' Evolver ' ) , Redeemer ( we might say ' Healer ' ) , and Sanctifier ( we might say ' Community-Builder ' ) into ' hypostases ' or ' personae ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these terms for a long time .
