People who listen to contemporary classical music do n't expect to like everything , or even to understand it . They often merely endure it , and remind themselves that Wagner and Beethoven were considered far out in their day too . Just how much a listener will unquestioningly endure was acknowledged last week by the British Broadcasting Corporation . On its highbrow Third Program , it recently broadcast a musical " composition " ' consisting of twelve minutes of random noise - and received no complaints . <P> Called Mobile for Tape and Percussion , the thing was identified to the audience as the work of one Piotr Zak , a young avant-garde Pole considered " one of the most controversial figures in contemporary music . " Zak 's " work " was a dreadful cacophony punctuated by rattles , bangs and random blows on a xylophone . Next morning the music critics passed learned if mystified judgment . Wrote the London Times : " It was certainly difficult to grasp more than the music 's broad outlines , partly because of the high proportion of unpitched sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Daily Telegraph : " Wholly unrewarding . " <P> Last week the BBC admitted the program was a deceit . Composer Zak turned out to be the head of the BBC 's chamber music department , Hans Keller , and accomplice Pianist Susan Bradshaw . They got the idea , they said , as they " were listening to the faintly melodious sounds produced by the moving of chairs . " Said Miss Bradshaw : " We dragged together all the instruments we could find and went around the studio banging them . ' ' She was pleased with the results . " It was a serious hoax , " she said . " That fake music can be indistinguishable from the genuine is a reflection on certain trends in present-day composition . "
