When Guillermo Arbona picked up his M.D. diploma from St. Louis University and returned to his native Puerto Rico in 1934 , the island 's death rate was 19.3 per 1,000 , as against 11 per 1,000 in the continental U.S. Malaria and tuberculosis were rampant , along with the so-called tropical diseases caused by intestinal parasites . The island 's annual health budget came to only $1.3 million-a mere 80 per capita . <P> Today , as Secretary of Health for up-by-the-bootstraps Puerto Rico , Dr. Arbona could proudly report that his island 's death rate has been cut to 7.2 per 1,000 , while the U.S. is only down to 9.4 per 1,000 . Malaria has been completely wiped out . Tuberculosis has been cut to 5% of its former incidence , and intestinal parasitic disease to 10% . The health budget is up to $70 million , or 21% of total Commonwealth spending ( only education takes more , with 31% ) . And much of the credit for improving the island 's health goes to Dr. Arbona himself . <P> Born in the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixation that besets so many Latin American physicians . He resented the fact that in 1934 San Juan had 35% of the island 's doctors while most of the communities had none . Working his way up through the Commonwealth 's health department , Dr. Arbona spent years organizing Puerto Rico 's scattered towns and villages into five medical regions , each with a modern medical center of its own . <P> He moved medical , nursing and welfare personnel out into the countryside so that the poorest sugar-cane workers ' children would get the same medical and dental examinations as city youngsters . Now there are clinics for pregnant women and for well babies-along with proper care for the sick . Where TB patients once languished for lack of treatment in a sanatorium , health workers now give out supplies of isoniazid to be taken at home , and then they check to make sure the pills are really taken . <P> While he was inaugurating these improvements , Dr. Arbona relied heavily on the help of public-health experts from the mainland ; now that Puerto Rico has become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand to give advice to other Latin American countries . <P> For his accomplishments , Dr. Arbona received one of three annual Bronfman Foundation awards ( $5,000 each ) of the American Public Health Association last week . The other winners : Dr. Alexander Langmuir , 55 , chief of the U.S. Public Health Service 's Communicable Disease Center in Atlanta ( the famed " disease detectives " ) , and Dr. George James , 50 , who is now taking the deanship of Manhattan 's developing Mount Sinai School of Medicine , after three years as New York City 's commissioner of health .
