 | Bing and I One night , not long ago , Gary Crosby and his wife , Barbara , invited my husband , Bing , and me to dinner . When we arrived , their son , Steve , aged seven , rushed to m eet us at the door . " Hi , Grandpa Bing , " he shouted . Then , with a second look at me , he added , " And Grandma Kathryn . " It was at that point that I realized ? perhaps more than ever before ? how fortunate I really am . At the age of twenty-eight , and after barely five years of mariage , I am the natural mother of three children , I have four handsome stepsons and seven grandhildren , not to mention several assorted nieces and nephews on my side of the family . And may I tell you that when this rollicking group gets together at our house for a Sunday afternoon picnic in the back yard , a few three-yearolds may go home with black eyes ! But is n't that true of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being married to Bing Crosby is the same as being married to Mr. Joe Anybody . However , although there are considerable differences such as my premature grandmotherhood there are many similarities , too . Because of the special nature of Bing 's career , many the things that happen to us might take place in unusual or exotic settings ; but , like every other family , we experience worry , hapiness , pain , frustration , warmth , anxiety and mutual love . Do you remember the time one your youngsters might have taken a header and frightened you of a year 's growth ? Well , the Crosbys go through experiences that , too . Last spring , for example , one of our dearest friends , Rosemary Clooney , had been working very hard doing television shows and recordings , and I invited her to spend a long and restful weekend with Bing and me at our house in Las Cruces , near the southern tip of the Baja peninsula in Mexico . Rosie and I flew down in our private plane . Our two older children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already there with their father . Bing and the two youngsters met us at the landing strip in our tiny Renault car , which has wicker seats , no doors and no top . The two miles between the air strip and our house are extremely circuitous and bumpy , and the rule is that the two children always sit in the back seat , tightly encased in safety belts . However , since Rosemary and I could n't both sit in the one bucket seat in the front , we climbed in the back with Mary Frances , and Harry sat proudly in the front seat next to Bing ( who was driving ) , holding onto the small chromium bar on the dashboard . Suddenly , but as if in slow motion , Harry fell out of the car . Right after that , I felt a slight bump . I was positive we had run over him . We sat still for what seemed like an hour but it could only have been a second or two . Bing and I leaped from the car to the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank God , Harry started bellowing like a bull . His little face was a mass of dirt and sand and blood and I could see his arm was split to the bone . Since I am studying to be a nurse , my training told me that I should keep him level and move him as little as possible . As Bing and I bent over him , he said , " I 'm sorry , Mommy and Daddy , I wo n't fall out again . " I came as close to fainting then as I ever have . We had to pick him up and get him into the car , and then we continued to the house . I got as much sand out of Harry 's mouth and left eye as I could . Then we wrapped him in a blanket and took him to the plane , where our pilot flew us all to the Social Security Hospital at La Paz , about a five-minute flight from Las Cruces . I held Harry , and Bing paced outside as X-rays were taken , establishing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no crack in the skull . The marvelous doctor sutured the wounds in his forehead , cheek and forearm . Bing and I spent the night in Harry 's room , where he slept under sedation . Rosemary was holding the fort at home , comforting a very disturbed Mary Frances . The following morning , Harry was allowed to go home . Bing sent a ship-to-shore message from a boat in the harbor to our pediatrician , Dr. John Ragan , in Los Angeles . ( Later Dr. Ragan told me that he thought Bing was an excellent ship-to-shore radio operator but not such a hot diagnostician . Bing had told him he thought Harry 's skull was fractured because the area around his eye was so swollen . ) We then left immediately on the four-and-a-half-hour flight to Los Angeles . Dr. Ragan met us at the airport and we went directly to Children 's Hospital . Harry remained there for four days . Today , six months later , Harry is fine although there is still some sand under the left eye , buried in the skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black eye . ( Which is n't at all unlikely with his sister around ! ) When I think of the whole nightmare , I recall that poor Rosemary Clooney 's " long and restful weekend " lasted a total of fifteen grief-torn hours . As this experience indicates , the life which Bing and I live does encompass the usual happening within the unusual . For the most part , the unusual has to do with geography . When Bing travels , he can not go to a hotel and simply ask the clerk for rooms for us and the children any more than the late Clark Gable could , or Cary Grant or John Wayne . He would be mobbed , and so would I and the children . For Bing and me , that is 87  | a wonderful expression of affection , but it 's just not terribly restful and would defeat the purpose of a vacation . So we have houses in our favorite retreats . The ranch at Rising River , California , is a rambling , one-story home furnished in a rustic style , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaid shirts and where we hunt and fish in the great trout stream which runs across the property . My sister , Frances Ruth , and her husband , Leonard Meyer , manage the ranch , where we have black Angus and Santa Gertrudis cattle and raise fine quarter horses . The house at Palm Springs , California , is also a low , one-story house with five incomparable golf courses nearby , which add that smooth sweetness to Bing 's disposition . When we are there , he plays every day . ( I play , too , but atrociously . I much prefer gallerying the experts . ) We very rarely have help there and I do all the cooking and what little cleaning is necessary . The house at Las Cruces , Mexico , is the most remote and restful of all except when Harry takes a dive out of a car . It can only be ched by private plane which is down on a small air strip about two miles from our home . ere we have no telephone and any messages must be flown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of adobe and red tile . Our at . True Love , is anchored in the Gulf of California , and here we fish for the big ones , like sailfish and black and silver marlin . ( We always keep a camera handy , leaving no fish stories to chance . When caught my very first marlin , a 62-pounder , Bing took a picture of me standing proudly alongside my catch . ) Of course , the home in which we do most of our daily living is the one in Los Angeles . This is an English manor-type house with towering oak , elm and jacaranda trees and beautiful foliage surrounding it . Bing 's mother , Mrs. Catherine Crosby , or " Mrs. Senior , " as she is now called , lives here with us , as does a fairly large staff , a necessity because we can- ' not maintain such a large home ( which houses my office as well as Bing 's ) without sufficient help and let 's face it as a housekeeper , I 'm a divine actress . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a very special person . Each one has duties in the house , but also pursues other endeavors . For example , the house manageress , Bernice Milovie , is a registered nurse . She at tidies every day , working toward her master 's degree in education . ( We often study together , since I expect to become an R.N. next December . ) Bridgette Brennan , Irish as her name , who is baby Nathaniel 's nurse , is a golf champion from her native County Tipperary in Ireland . As Bridgette might say it , " ' t is a grand sight indeed to see her and Bing on the lawn practicing their chip shots together . " Seventeen-year-old Marielle du Janchay , who has just recently joined us from France to be Harry 's and Mary Frances ' nurse , will soon go to school to learn to speak English . I want to groom her to be a model for my favorite dress designer , Jean Louis . Leo Lynn , who has been Bing 's man for more than 25 years , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he is n't accompanying Bing to Europe or elsewhere ; and last summer , his two daughters came to spend two months with Bing and me . Louis Serpe , " Mrs. Senior 's " chauffeur , loves to spend his leisure time acting as a sort of camp counselor and social director for the children . ( What a change this kind of living is for a little girl from West Columbia , Texas , accustomed to a cleaning lady once a week in her tiny apart-ment ! ) There are other unusual aspects of our life . One is the children 's relationship with their famous celebrity father . Not that they know he is a celebrity . When they hear one of his records , they say , " That 's Daddy ! " But I 'm sure they think all daddies sing and make records . When we travel , we never know what to expect . One day in a tiny village in Italy we came across a restaurant called II Ristorante Bing Crosby ! On two other occasions our Palm Springs house was used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visiting there . When my father ran for the Senate seat in Texas vacated by Lyndon Johnson ( which , needless to say , Dad did n't gain ) , Bing stopped off in Fort Worth , Texas , to campaign for him . These are some of the differences in our life . But I believe the similarities to the average American life are much more numerous . For instance , I seem to provide my husband with a good many laughs , either at me or with me . The first really hysterical moment in our marriage came not twelve hours after our wedding . After the ceremony , we had flown to Palm Springs . As a brand-new bride , I had insisted that no one be there to help us . I had planned our first dinner together . I decided to create a Jello mold to end all Jello molds . Into the black cherry base I threw walnuts , grapes , marsh-C  | mallows , bananas , apples and anything else I could find . It was truly beautiful . I showed it to Bing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upended it , tapped the bottom under warm water to get it out of the mold and onto the platter in one piece ? and watched in horror as it slipped out of the mold and straight down the garbage disposal . We dined that night in Bing 's favorite restaurant . Does n't this place me squarely in the classic , traditional bride 's predicament when she ruins her first meal for her husband ? Another area which I share with most American mothers is the problem of our youngsters ' education and the conflict that sometimes arises between a doting father and a dedicated educator . As a student nurse , I 'm quite used to being corrected and told what to do and what not to do . But there are not many people who can do this with Bing . I know . I 've tried it and it does n't work very often . Just recently , however , Harry and Mary Frances entered the Buckley School in Los Angeles . Harry is in kindergarten and Mary Frances attends the nursery school . Bing decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and told me to inform the school that the children would not be there during that time . In response to my telephone call , Ring received a letter . It said , in effect , " Dear Mr. Crosby : I 'm sorry , but you can not take the children out 9 ( 1 of school at this time . We do not consider it wise to interrupt their progress in the middle of a school semester . We will appreciate co-operation in this matter . " It was signed by the principal of school . Bing took off for Rising River accompanied only by his youngest son , Nathaniel , who is still three years away from Miss Buckley 's control . I have spoken of laughter in our marriage . I might add that in all good marriages , there are also arguments . I would distrust a marriage that did n't have a row every now and again . Let me tell you of one of our better efforts along this line . Bing and I were to leave for Santa Barbara one afternoon at 4:00 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Queen of Angels Hospital , where I am studying , but I had packed and promised to be home on time to leave at 4 o'clock . After the lecture , I stopped to talk to some of my classmates about it .  | I forgot the time . I arrived home . breathless , at five minutes after four . Bing had already left for Santa Barbara ! I wept with frustration and fury , both at myself for being late and at Bing for not waiting for me . When he finally called me that evening , I took an offensive stand . deciding that would be the best defense . Bing must have come to the same conclusion . That telephone wire hummed for some time . Bing told me I was thoughtless . I retorted that he was irresponsible . It ended with a goodnight kiss through the phone and protestations of lasting affection , and Bing had Leo Lynn drive me there the following morning . But while it lasted , it was a good , satisfactory fight . Having Bing to fight with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the furthest thing from my mind when I was placed under contract to Paramount Studios in 1952 . I was 18 years old at the time . I had won a number of beauty contests in my native state of Texas . ( One labeled all 101 pounds of me Miss Fat Stock of Houston , 1950 . ) A talent scout named Art Rush had seen me and had brought me to Hollywood . Being under contract was exciting enough for my young life . I was attending classes at UCLA , working toward my bachelor 's degree in fine arts , while at the studio I was being pumped full of knowledge in such skills as drama , singing and dancing . At the end of a day , I would go home and simply collapse with fatigue . But one morning on the Paramount lot , my life became even more ex- continued WI page 132  | citing . I was escorting some friends visiting from Texas when Bing Crosby rode by on a bicycle . He called out , " Hi , Tex . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invited all of us to have tea with him . I thought he was very nice and so polite . So did my friends . But for the time being , that was that . Some time later , after I had screamed mightily in one film , and had been nearly murdered in another , Paramount failed to pick up my option . I was , in show business parlance , " at liberty . " By now , I had had dinner a few times with Bing , but then he had left the city and I had n't heard from him in some time . I was miserable , but luckily , Columbia Pictures tested me and they placed me under contract . Now my career was booming , my studies were coming along well , I had very little time for dating and not much inclination to date , anyway . The men I met just were n't like Bing Crosby . To me he was suave , fascinating and terribly kind . He seemed to enjoy being with me for what I like to think was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film contract , I decided to go back to the University of Texas to finish school and receive my degree there . My mother , who was a schoolteacher , attended classes with me , and I did get the degree . It was a very proud moment when I handed that sheepskin to my father , who was also a teacher in the small town of West Columbia , Texas , where I was born and reared . Dad always insisted that no matter what happened , I should finish my education . I returned to Hollywood and rented a small apartment ( incidentally my first , since I had always lived in Los Angeles with my Southern aunt and uncle , Mary and Guilbert Banks ) and resumed acting at Columbia . Then one night , right out of the blue , Bing called to invite me to attend the Academy Award ceremonies . He had been nominated as best actor for his work in Country Girl . Needless to say , I accepted . I was in a dither for days about what to wear . The studio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hayworth for a film , but I decided I was n't the type . I finally bought the perfect dress , a simple , off-white lace gown . Walking down the aisle that night to the seats reserved for Bing as a nominee , we were the cynosure of all eyes . The next morning , although Bing lost out to Marlon Brando , our pictures were in all the newspapers . I believe the press devoted more space to speculating about whether or not we would get married than they did when we did get married . On October 24 , 1957 , I became Mrs. Bing Crosby in St. Anne 's Church in Las Vegas , Nevada . The immediate events leading up to the ceremony were nothing short of chaotic . First of all , Bing 's proposal was a bit unorthodox . We had n't seen each other for several months . I was on tour for a motion picture , and Bing had also been away 132 on a film location . One Sunday morning , I was dressing in my apartment to go to church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Bing . He said , " Kathryn , what I have to say to you will take only about a minute . " I said , " Good , that 's about all I have because I 'm on my way to church . " Bing said , " Let 's get married ! " That was , for me , the historic moment . A few days later , we were in Las Vegas for the ceremony . Just before the ceremony , reporters got wind of the impending wedding because , naturally , we had had to apply for a marriage license . I applied under my real name , Olive Kathryn Grandstaff . Bing applied under his real name , Harry Lillis Crosby , but no one was really fooled . Since we wanted to have a lovely , reverent and quiet service , Bing told reporters we would be married somewhere near the ranch he then owned in Elko , Nevada . Instead , Aunt Mary and I arrived in Las Vegas and stayed at a hotel , where we registered under the names of Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came downstairs dressed in my first Jean Louis suit , wearing a single strand of pearls and a mink stole borrowed from Aunt Mary . Leo Lynn , Bing 's man , met us in the lobby . " Happy is the bride when the sun shines , " he boomed . I looked desperately around for a doorway in which to duck , but there was no doorway and it was all too late anyway . The press was waiting . Notwithstanding , the ceremony was quiet and lovely , although I confess I do n't think I would have noticed had they released a rocket in the church . With marriage , Bing and I settled down to a life which , bcause of its specialized situations , could hardly be called routine . First , there were the comments about the difference in our ages , a circumstance to which Bing and I have never given much thought at all . In any good marriage , in which both partners truly love each other , what possible difference does it make what age each is ? Secondly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons , Gary , Philip , Dennis and Lindsay , by his marriage to Dixie Lee Crosby , who died several years ago , did not know exactly how to consider me . The boys , all in their twenties , revere the memory of their mother . I certainly was n't their mother , yet I was their father 's wife . But , as in all close family relationships , we resolved the awkward period by making a real effort to get to know one another . I started a series of Sunday afternoon get-togethers where Philip 's wife , - Sandra , Dennis ' wife , Pat , Lindsay 's wife , Barbara , and Gary 's wife , also Barbara , would all make their culinary favorites , bring them to the house , and we would picnic in the yard . Then the boys and their wives would have us over to their houses for spaghetti dinners and the like . We talk babies , and Sandra even had me with her when godson number 1 , Brian Patrick , was born . Godson number 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't allow stray midwives , mothers-in-law or not , in the delivery room . THE old saw about not really knowing someone until you live with was as applicable in my marriage as it is in anyone else 's . I had to get to know Bing , too , as well as the rest of the family . I had to accustom myself to his peripatetic habits , his likes and dislikes in food , fashions and other fundamentals . For one thing , I discovered that , although Bing has always had reputation for favoring wildly-colored , plaid jackets and one purple sock and one red ( worn simultaneously ) this is not basically true . Although Bing is usually casual in his dress , he gets more than mildly disturbed who his sartorial composition is not perfet . I once saw him in an absolute agony because he could not find a white tie to wear with his full dress suit to a formal party . He had to wear a black tie and dinner jacket and he spent the evening being self-conscious and miserable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This fits in with his similar passion for being on time . As a result , I 've given him seven different kinds of clocks for birthdays and anniversaries . All my other gifts to Bing , too , are tailored to his particular likes and dis likes . Once for Christmas , I gave him a rubber fishing raft . He had been complaining that the regular rowboats made too much noise and frightened away the fish . Perhaps my most unusual gift to Bing is a complete journal , accompanied by thousands of pictures , of every trip we have taken . When we went to Rome for the 1960 Olympic Games and then on to Vienna and Paris , I kept a diary of everything we saw and did and , when we got home , I found I had written 140 pages ! Then , in the autumn of 1961 , we went with Bob and Dolores Hope to London , where Bing and Bob made The Road to Hong Kong . I was expecting Nathaniel then and had plenty of time to recount in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hopes , such as total inability of our jointly-shared very British butler to accustom himself to our very American informal ways . I wrote pages about how the butler became outraged when our brilliant photographer friend , Phil Stern , superimposed caricatures of Bing 's and Bob 's heads atop the bodies of two unknown . gentlemen in a seventeenth-centuy  | painting in the manor house in which we were staying . Among the more amazing things I have discovered about my husband is that he has a real flair for interior decorating , even though he goes about it in an unorthodox , **28;311;TOOLONG way . It all began when Bing announced one night that the living room in our Los Angeles home seemed very dark to him . I was delighted when he said that , because I had been going quietly blind trying to read in there . We decided to have the room painted and chose an off-white color with a faint shade of green which we copied from the petal of a flower in one of our treasured Vlaminck paintings . That Christmas , Bing presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided that the draperies looked a bit shabby next to the opulence of the breakfront . Together we chose a creamy-white quilted fabric for the new draperies . In Bing 's methodical step-by-step fashion , we then acquired two eighteenth-century Adams chairs , four Louis XV chairs with the original tapestry still intact , new front hall draperies ( chosen exclusively by Bing ) , two Hepplewhite commodes and two paintings by Riche . In this way , we gradually transformed our home into a replica of the English manor houses Bing so admires . IN THE same way that he has collected good furniture , so has Bing also collected good friends over the years . Phil Harris and his wife , Alice Faye ; Bing 's top writer , Bill Morrow , and his wife , Mary ; actor William Gargan and his wife , Mary ; John Scott Trotter , music conductor and antique dealer ; and industrialist Leonard Firestone and his wife , Polly , might make up our guest list for one of our small dinner parties . But the best times of all for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children are at home together . In the evening , after the kids are in bed , Bing and I sit together in the den . We read ( Bing voraciously reads everything from William Faulkner to the popular and esoteric magazines ) or we watch television . Bing 's favorite program , not too surprisingly , is Ben Casey , which is done by his own company , Bing Crosby Productions . He does occasionally grumble about the show because , he says , " it comes on too late . " We like to be in bed by ten . During our daytime hours , we react with parental pride when our threeyear-old daughter , Mary Frances , becomes the first child of her age to earn her Red Cross swimming certificate . Bing looks ecstatic when he has finally taught four-year-old Harry how to pound a nail in a board without taking off a finger . I glow with a special warmth when I hear Bing in the nursery singing one-year-old Nathaniel to sleep . It is during these moments that I often think of a book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Me Lucky , and I say to myself , again and again , " Call me Mrs. Lucky . "
