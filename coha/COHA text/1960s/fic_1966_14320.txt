( A white wall upstage running the width of the stage . A door in the wall stage left . A large bookcase stands from floor to ceiling stage right up against the wall . There are no books in it and it looks as though it 's in the process of being built . Sawdust , nails , pieces of wood , saws , etc. , are scattered around the floor . TOM stands on a stool in front of the bookcase with a hammer in his hand and nails in his mouth . He wears no shirt and is sweating a great deal . ED stands in the doorway with the door half open , talking to TOM , whose back is to the audience . The lights come up fast to bright blue . ) ED The leaves change color now so it looks even more protected than it really is . Vacant is better . No , protected . Something like that . Come up anyway if you get a chance . ( ED shuts the door behind him and exits , the lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls off the bookcase onto the floor , TOM looks at the shelf for a while , then climbs down off the stool , picks up the shelf , and climbs back up ; he replaces the shelf in its former position , the lights change back to blue , the door opens , and ED re-enters carrying some lumber , sets the lumber on the floor downstage center . ) TOM ( With his back to ED ) This is a rented cabin or something ? p. 3 ED No . TOM You bought it ? ED No . It was given to me , donated to me . It 's mine to use . One full room . I have to fix it , though . It needs patching , plumbing , electricity , etcetera . TOM That 's nice of them . ( He hammers a nail into one of the shelves . ) ED ( Yelling to be heard over the hammering ) Nice of who ? ( TOM stops hammering . ) TOM What ? Oh  --  nice of whoever gave it to you . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not so nice ! I mean they did n't even give it that much thought one way or the other ! They were n't really trying to be nice at all . Like I said , it was more in the spirit of a donation ! ( ED sits on the lumber with his back to the audience . ) TOM ( Looking at the bookcase ; he stops hammering . ) That 's even nice , though . They did n't have to be necessarily aware of the niceness of what they were doing . In fact if they had been it would have made it anything but nice . It would have gone into the realm of charity . I mean the spirit of charity . But they gave it out of no particular spirit at all . It was devoid of any spirit whatsoever , which makes it beautiful and free from emotional claptrap . ( TOM hammers loudly for a while as ED looks up at him. ) p. 4 ED ( Yelling ) Anyway it 's a full room if you want to come up ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and come when you can ! ( TOM stops hammering . ) TOM ( Still staring at the bookcase ) You 're going to walk out on me . Is that it ? Right in the middle of a job . ED Look , I got the structure built for you . You can put in the shelves yourself . TOM Thanks , friend . ED I have to finish the cabin before it snows . ( ED stands as though to leave . ) TOM ( Without turning ) And it does snow up there ! Boy , oh boy , the way it can snow when it wants to . A little tiny , eety , beety , teeny , weeny cabin like yours in the midst of a raging blizzard . In the midst of hail and snow and sleet . Calling out for some insulation . Calling for someone to warm its little hearth and seal up its cracking paint . Run to its side before it 's too late ! Run to its aid and attention ! ( A shelf falls off the bookcase onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stare at the shelf ; DONNA enters carrying two cans of white paint and two brushes , she kicks the door shut and smiles at TOM and ED. ) p. 5 DONNA Hello there and I got some paint . Is n't that fine ? So we 'll paint it all up between the three of us . ( She sets the cans downstage left on top of each other and sits on them with her back to the audience , TOM climbs down off the stool , picks up the shelf , climbs back up , and replaces the shelf . ) TOM ED was just thinking about us going to his cabin in the woods . ( ED sits back down on the lumber . ) DONNA Seems to me as though that 's a bad idea offhand . Bad for several reasons . Bad because we 're meeting people , bad because we 're building shelves , and bad because we have to paint them . Of course it 's good for Ed , however . It could be good for us too if we did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an idea that we had tossed haphazardly into the air without considering all the strikes against us or pondering it for long periods of time . DONNA Well . ( She stands and slaps her thigh , she crosses to the bookcase . ) How 's it coming ? ED Tom thinks it could be finished in short order . Seeing as how the frame is all finished , the rest should be easy . DONNA Good boy ! ( She slaps TOM on the butt. ) p. 6 ED The thing is I ca n't wait around for the grand finale . I have to leave . DONNA Oh , it wo n't be anything to see , Ed . It 's just a functional piece of basic furniture for around the house . For everyday use , so to speak . TOM Everyday , Everyday nothing . Once ! It will be put to use once in its lifetime and that 'll be the end . You never read the books to begin with . The ones you did read you read halfway . The rest you bought for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space . Fourteen hundred thousand books to put in a bookcase once and never touch them again till the day you die . DONNA I read like a fool , Tom . You know that and yet you 'd like Ed to believe otherwise . In fact you 'd like him to believe the exact opposite which is a lie . I could even prove it if it came to a matter of my having to defend my knowledge of books . Would you like me to prove it ? ED No . TOM I do n't really care actually . It just seems that books read once are better off in the trash can than they are sitting around on dusty shelves . That 's a personal point of view . ED Not really . At times I 've found myself very briefly getting very attached to books . Very emotionally attached . Like you would with a pet dog . It becomes something that 's very hard to give up . You ca n't just throw it in the garbage with any kind of ease . p. 7 TOM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The response of the book stays with you wherever you go , whatever you do . In sickness and in health and through the long sad wintertime . ( He starts hammering ; DONNA yells . ) DONNA We 're not going on no vacation until this gets done ! Until it 's nailed , sanded and painted , and stacked with books on every shelf ! Then it 's waxed , polished , and smells like the great outdoors ! After that then we go ! Not before or in the middle ! ( TOM stops hammering , the lights change to blue . ) TOM It 's an impossibility . We 'll be here forever . The winter will pass without a vacation , without a change of scenery . There 'll be no free moments to wander around through yellow fields or climb purple trees . The task will last forever .

It 's such a long ways up . It 's like climbing three or four mountains in succession . It 's also very much like rowing a rowboat in a rowboat race or running many miles over rough terrain in the freezing coldness . My goodness . Dearie. p. 8 TOM I 'm not on display , you know . DONNA ( Still sitting ) Hi , Mom . I see you brought up some of the books for me . Thanks . MOM Yes . A few . They made it very much tougher on me . They must weigh a great deal nowadays . They 've changed weight since I was a schoolgirl in my schooling days . TOM I 'm not up here for my health , you know . I have a job to do . DONNA It 's worth it though , Mom . When they 're all stacked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight to see . MOM Oh indeed . Libraries fascinate me to death . Like ancient tapestry or Chinese urns or butterfly collections that I 've seen in the past . Many times . Goodness yes . TOM This is not a show ! I happen not to be a professional carpenter or an expert nailing person . There 's no reason to watch me work . ED It 's not you in particular . It 's what you 're making . TOM But I 'm making it ! You 're watching me make it ! MOM Should we leave here ? DONNA No , no , no . TOM It 's turned into some kind of funny picnic or something which I do n't like . I prefer to do it alone if I have to . p. 9 ED We wo n't pay attention . We 'll talk to each other . DONNA Right . ( DONNA crosses over to ED and MOM and sits on the floor ; they gather around in a circle and talk , ignoring TOM . ) Ed suggested we go up to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right . MOM Oh that 'd be very fine . I 'd like it . I certainly would . ( TOM turns back to the bookcase and starts hammering loudly again ; the other three yell at each other . ) DONNA Such peace in the mountains ! MOM Yes ! And birds ! ED Singing all the time ! DONNA Such fun ! MOM Lovely ! Lovely ! ( TOM throws down the hammer and goes out the door , slamming it behind him ; the three stare at the door , then DONNA stands and picks up the hammer , she climbs slowly up on the stool with her back to the audience ; ED and MOM watch her . ) DONNA The time I spent deciding which books to choose and how and why . All that time perusing tiny bookstore shelves and never a thought as to where they 'd wind up . Never one little thought about how to store books , how to keep them . p. 10 ED I know . DONNA And it could be so lovely , too . So very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and groups together . Without concern for what they 're about or what they mean to me and who wrote them when . Just in terms of size and shape and color . MOM Yes , dear . DONNA But I 'm at a loss . I 'm really not ready to hammer and nail just yet . I ca n't bring myself around to it . I 'd like it all done . I 'd like to see it all finished and done and through with . ( ED stands . ) ED I was going to  --  ( DONNA turns abruptly on the stool toward ED . ) DONNA Sit down ! ED I started  --  DONNA Sit back down ! ( ED sits on the lumber again . ) Do you have to feel guilty about something you have nothing to do with ! MOM That 's true . DONNA Do you ! I did n't ask you to apologize to me for not having finished my bookcase . Did I ! No I did n't . As a matter of fact I was talking to myself rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversing actually . Of course there was no way of your knowing that . p. 11 ED I was just saying  --  DONNA You were just going to say that you felt bad inside your heart because you did n't finish my bookcase when you were supposed to . That instead of finishing you pawned the job off on my husband and went off on a nifty little vacation in the woods somewhere . And finally that you allowed my poor old mother to haul books up eight flights of stairs in the midst of her old age . ED I  --  ( The lights change to white ; the door opens slowly and POP enters with his arms full of books , he crosses slowly down left and stacks the books in a pile , then sits on them with his back to the audience as the others watch . ) MOM There he is . I love him . DONNA But you do n't need to . ( She turns slowly upstage again , facing the bookcase . ) It 's quite all right with me . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the future as a future reference . Next time we 'll know what to do . We 'll have gathered together our joint experience and be able to use it as a kind of guidepost or maybe even a kind of guiding light . POP Boy , oh boy . Lots of stairs . I 'll say that . DONNA ( Without turning around ) Lots of books , Pop . I 'm glad to see you helping , even though it must be painful . p. 12 POP There 's many more . Never seen so many . Tons and tons down there . All piled up . MOM ( Still sitting stage right ) Poor baby . ( ED stands again . ) ED I should go down maybe . ( DONNA turns on the stool . ) DONNA No ! Sit down there and stay sitting ! ( ED sits back down . ) The books will make their way up gradually . Ever so slowly . They 'll come up an arm load at a time . Carried by friends or relatives or people who might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like to help . MOM Yes , dear . DONNA That 's fine . That 's really all right but I 've just decided against it , Ed . I 've decided you might just gum up the works . And we ca n't have that . Not at this stage of the game . POP It 's like climbing hills . DONNA Not that we have to be overly careful . But selectivity has its good points now and then . POP There 's nothing like a climb now and then . DONNA After a while , in fact , you forget the whole business . The preparation , the blueprint , the ideas , the measurements . We just pass through the room and take the whole shmear for granted . p. 13 MOM Yes . ED I know , but I made it to order . It 's precisely done . Just nail up the shelves and it could be considered a finished piece of work . Not even painted it would serve its purpose . POP What I was thinking was about a pulley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many books as that . MOM Yes , dear . DONNA You mean out the window ? Very good , Pop ! Hang some pulleys out the window . ( ED stands . ) Where are you going now ? ED My cabin . MOM Oh . DONNA That 's right . A one-room place , right ? In the woods somewhere ? ED Yes . DONNA How did you come by such a nice little place as that ? ED It was given  --  donated , rather . MOM Oh yes . DONNA It could be fixed into a year-round home , I imagine . ED That 's what I 'm working on . DONNA With heat and gas and electric lights all around . Like a Christmas house . p. 14 ED Christmas ? POP In the snow . DONNA Comfortable and homey , I imagine . Somehow I see it lost in the woods and nobody even living there . ED Really ? DONNA Yes . And somehow it maintains itself all year round . Somehow it adapts itself to every change in the weather and turns on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again in the morning . It even flushes its own toilet and builds its own fires and makes its little bed . There 's no footprints around it at all . Just buried one quarter of the way in snow , and smoke coming out its chimney . Just sitting there in a small clearing about half a mile from a frozen lake . A Christmas house . ED There 's no lake at all and I have n't even built the chimney yet . POP Oh too bad . DONNA But you 're going to ? ED I might . DONNA Well how will you stay there all year round if you do n't have a chimney ? ED Who says I 'm staying ? DONNA You did . You told me that . ED I might . p. 15 DONNA You will . I can tell you will . You wo n't ever come back once you get all moved in . ED You make it sound very definite . Like I have no choice . DONNA I 'm sorry . ED It 's a place for retirement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resting and walking and not doing much else . DONNA Well that 's fine then . You should have no trouble . This then is your very last job on earth , I take it . And to think you 're leaving it unfinished . That gets to me a little when I think of it . An unfinished piece of work . ED For Christ 's sake , I finished the frame . ( The lights change to blue ; the door opens and TOM enters , his arms full of books , he kicks the door shut , he stands holding the books and looking around at all the people . ) TOM You still here ? ED I guess . POP Tommy boy . TOM Are you finishing up , my dear ? DONNA Yes , I thought I would . ( She turns toward the bookcase and starts hammering loudly on the shelves ; the rest yell their lines. ) p. 16 ED I really have to leave ! I 'm sorry ! TOM Well go then ! Go ! It 's under control ! It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it organized ! MOM A Christmas house ! ED But I 'd like to help some more ! TOM No need ! We have enough hands as it is ! You 're only in the way ! ( DONNA stops hammering but does not turn around , TOM still holds the books . ) ED I 'm really sorry . Well all right . So long then . ( ED slowly crosses to the door and exits as the others watch him . ) ' Bye . ( He waves to them , then closes the door behind him . ) DONNA ( Still facing the bookcase ) Pop used to talk about a house like that when I was a girl and he was a father . How come you stopped thinking of that house , Pop ? ( TOM crosses slowly to extreme stage right and sets the books in a pile , then sits on them with his back to the audience . ) POP Whereabouts ? MOM Oh dear . DONNA How could it happen like that ? I mean so easily . Without any regrets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 17 MOM Yes , dear . POP They 're all heavy . DONNA Not minding at all one way or the other . Letting things slip away from you as though it did n't matter . As though it were all a joke and talking about a Christmas house does n't really mean there will ever be one . I can see that ! TOM Donna ! ( She turns slowly around on the stool and faces TOM . ) DONNA Yes , dear ? TOM Shall we paint or not ? DONNA Not just yet , I do n't think . I do n't care that much one way or the other . TOM We ca n't leave them plain . ( He crosses to the cans of paint and opens them . ) DONNA We could . Of course we could . If worse came to worse we could sit on the books all year round and forget about the shelves . Like a bunch of hens . How about it ? They might even hatch . MOM Yes , dear . ( TOM kneels facing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) TOM We ca n't leave it plain no matter how you look at it . We bought the paint already . p. 18 DONNA That does n't matter now . The color 's unimportant . ( She gets down off the stool and crosses to the pile of books that TOM brought in , she picks a few of the books up ; she turns as though to go back to the bookcase , TOM stands with the paintbrush in his hand . ) TOM Just leave the books where they are . ( DONNA stops and faces TOM , her arms full of books . ) DONNA Look . I do n't give a damn any more about how it looks . TOM That 's just too bad . We started it and now we 'll finish . DONNA We started nothing . You never even wanted a bookcase at all . In the beginning . TOM But now it 's there and it has to be finished . DONNA Has to be nothing . We leave it as it is . ( She approaches the bookcase . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , MOM and POP remain indifferent throughout all this . ) DONNA Is it that important to you really ? I mean in your heart of hearts ? TOM Most important . It 's become essential . It 's become over-powering to me . Coloring every moment of my waking hours . I wake up thinking of this bookcase and I sleep dreaming of it . I walk around with the smell of it in my nose and I can see it in the future . I have a picture in my head of what it might become and I plan to fulfill that picture if it 's the last thing I do . p. 19 DONNA Swell ! ( She drops the books abruptly on the floor , TOM swings the paintbrush through the air so that paint streaks down the front of Donna . ) Shithead ! ( They stare at each other but do not move , MOM and POP simultaneously pull a book out from each of their respective piles and start reading them with their backs still to the audience . ) TOM I could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the planning stage . But now it 's too late . Now it 's definitely too late . DONNA You 've become very definite very fast . ( She moves slowly toward the second paintbrush as TOM stalks her , holding the brush in front of him like a weapon . ) TOM I find it helps . I 'm not so wishy-washy and I can make fast decisions on a moment 's notice . DONNA Right on top , as they say . TOM Exactly . DONNA Must be nice . TOM It is . I feel at home in any situation . I baffle everyone around me and I 'm known for my wit . DONNA A joy to be with . TOM Of course . ( DONNA grabs the other brush and dips it in the paint , TOM makes a lunge toward her but backs away , they hold the brushes in front of them and crouch for attack. ) p. 20 DONNA People must flock to your side . You must have what they call " magnetism , " a pulling sensation . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . TOM Very close to it . ( They rush at each other and slap the brushes across each other 's face  --  this should happen almost as though they were making a mockery of the fight , like two old gentlemen slapping each other with gloves  --  they back away and resume the crouch more typical of a street fight with knives . MOM and POP gradually turn toward the audience while sitting on their stacks of books , they become very engrossed in their reading , POP turns toward stage left and MOM toward stage right . ) DONNA How could it lie dormant for so many years ? Just under the surface and itching to pop out . TOM I had no chance . No field to practice in . I 'd throw rocks now and then but there was always something left over . Some extra zest . DONNA All the windows you broke in preparation . All the dirt clods you threw . And the people chasing you across acres of vacant lots , firing shotguns and swearing your name . TOM My name was death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town . Even enemies of myself . p. 21 DONNA But now ! ( They charge and slap each other again with the brushes , then back away . ) TOM Yes ! And my health has changed for the better . Even my eyes sparkle and my ears are clear . My whole body pulses with new life . DONNA The trouble is the longevity . Its lasting power . It seems like a stage to me . Just a frame of mind . Temporarily manic is the way I 'd put it . TOM But that 's so wrong . So easily overlooking what 's right in front of you . You ca n't see the way my veins stand out ? The way my temples throb ? ( They charge and slap each other , this time more deliberately and enjoying it less , they back away . ) DONNA You 'll fall back into it again . Wait and see . You 'll sleep for days , afraid to get up . You 'll wet your bed . TOM I 'll jump out of bed ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me when I 'm at my best . DONNA You 'll tremble under stacks of blankets , afraid to show your face . How will you account for the lies you 've told ? TOM Nothing false about it . I 've gone through that stage . That pubic stage . ( By this time MOM and POP are directly facing the audience and remain that way to the end of the play , deeply absorbed in reading. ) p. 22 DONNA Prone on your back forever and ever . You 'll cry to be read to . You 'll want a bedtime story twenty-four hours a day . And no lights . I 'll have to read to you with a flashlight tucked under my arm . The room will be dark and you 'll whimper until you fall asleep . TOM It could never happen now ! ( They charge and viciously paint each other with the brushes , then back away ; they are both covered with white paint by now . ) DONNA All you 'll have is a tiny little glimmer of your present excitement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever , trying to get it back . The bed will be your house and home and your head will be glued to the pillow . Your arms will be stuck to the sheet and your legs will be paralyzed from the hip down . You ca n't turn your head because you drool from the mouth and pus will run out your nose . Your eyes fill up with water and pour over onto your cheeks and each ear hums from hearing nothing . You lie in pools of urine and feces for days on end until the bed and you become one thing . One whole thing and there 's no way of telling where the bed stops and you begin . You smell the same , you look the same , you act the same , you are the same . ( The lights change to white ; the door opens and ED enters with his arms full of books , he kicks the door shut , DONNA and TOM drop the brushes on the floor and look at ED , MOM and POP keep reading. ) p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Decided to bring up a load . DONNA AND TOM Good . ED Where should I set them ? DONNA AND TOM Oh , anywhere is all right . ( Ed crosses and piles the books down center , then turns and looks at the bookcase . ) ED How 's it coming ? DONNA AND TOM Not bad . ED There 's not as many down there as you had me believe . I mean by the way you were talking anybody would think you were flooded with books . But there 's just a few . A couple more trips and you 'll have it done . DONNA AND TOM We decided to stay . ED What ? No , I mean a couple more trips up the stairs and you 'd have it all finished . The books . DONNA AND TOM We 're staying up here . ED Well I ca n't bring them all . One trip is all I have time for . It wo n't take very long and you forget the climb after a while . You were probably counting the flights as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you stop counting , it 'll go much faster . I can assure you of that . I personally find work to be easier if I distract myself rather than pour my full concentration into it . That way you forget about your body and therefore you 're not conscious of being fatigued or exhausted . In fact I usually finish up a day 's work fully refreshed . I know that seems odd to most people but it 's true . Work tends to boost my energy rather than diminish it . p. 24 DONNA AND TOM That does seem strange . ED The trouble is I do n't have enough time . I would n't mind bringing the rest up for you but I really have to go . DONNA AND TOM That 's quite all right . ( They both turn upstage and stare at the bookcase with their backs to ED . ) ED It 's just too bad all the way around . We should all take some time off . You know ? Why do n't we do that ? We could all go up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'd be just in time for the first snow . And we could make some kind of special dinner . You know , a turkey dinner with cranberry sauce . Then we could build a fire and sit around drinking hot chocolate . Then we could  --  MOM AND POP ( Reading from the books ) And the snow started early and came so soft that nobody even noticed . The only way they could really tell was the way the trees slowly changed from green to white . ED We could do that . It would just be a visit . I 'm all moved in so I do n't need any help . MOM AND POP It fell for hours and hours , then days and days , and it looked like it would n't stop . In fact everyone decided that it would n't stop and it kept going on . Falling down and down . p. 25 ED There 's really enough room even though it 's small . MOM AND POP But the funny thing was that there was n't any wind and there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the color it was to white . But it got thicker and thicker so the people went outside but it did n't get any better . It got thicker and thicker and covered all their trees . ED I really ca n't hang around . I have to get back to my house now . MOM AND POP It got so bad that they had to climb a hill and watch from the top while their houses disappeared . It happened very slow but they never sat down and their legs got very strong . ED I 'll even buy the food and cook it all myself . MOM AND POP It happened very slow and they stood very still until the smoke went away from their little chimney tops . Then the trees disappeared while they all just looked and did n't say a word but stood in a line looking straight ahead . The blanket moved up and the valley disappeared but the people did n't cry and it kept coming down and it kept piling up and they all just stared and did n't say a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone but ED says the next lines simultaneously in perfect synchronization . MOM and POP still reading and facing front , DONNA and TOM still facing the bookcase , and ED somewhere in the middle. ) p. 26 ALL BUT ED The place was in white as far as they could see and not a sound or a wind or a hint of cold or hot . Not a taste in their mouth or a sting in their nose . And they moved very slow away from the place . And they moved and they moved and they did n't say a thing . Did n't laugh , did n't cry , did n't moan , did n't sigh , did n't even cough as the snow came down . ED It 's just too bad ! ALL BUT ED And once they turned they did n't turn around and once they walked they did n't even stop and they met more people as they went along , all new people as they went along , and the ground was white for as far as they could see and the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the crowd was thick and the air was thin but there was n't any cold and there was n't any hot and they could n't even stop . ( ED joins in at this point as they all say the lines in perfect unison ; they do n't wait for ED , he simply joins them . ) ALL So they just moved on and on and on and as the story goes they never did stop , they never did drop , they never lagged behind or even speeded up . They never got tired and they never got strong and they did n't feel a thing . And nobody knows how they ever got lost , how they ever got away . To this very same day nobody knows how they ever got away . ( The lights change to blue , all the shelves fall off the bookcase onto the floor , none of the actors move ; the blue light dims out very slowly to the end of the play , MOM and POP stand slowly as the other actors start to hum " White Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the floor and carrying it off-stage through the door . MOM and POP read alternately from the book , staying on either side of the stage ; the other three clean the entire stage , starting with the debris , then the books , then dismounting the entire set and taking it off so that the stage is completely bare by the end of the play ; they hum the tune more loudly as they continue , likewise MOM and POP read more loudly. ) p. 27 POP The original plan unfortunately has n't changed , despite publicity to the contrary . The radial city exists much the same as it always has in the past . In fact it never really occurred out of a preconception on the part of individual architects or city planners . MOM It occurred more out of a state of frenzy and a complete lack of consideration for the future function of a place to live and/or work . The present condition is only the outcome of that lack of consideration . POP Consequently the city as it exists today affords certain people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of living than it does certain other people . This situation occurs in terms of center points similar to the hub of a wheel . The center of a city always offers people more diversions , more necessities , and more of everything they need to stay alive . MOM Therefore the center is densely populated and has a greater coagulation of excitement in the air . The farther one gets from this center point the less one is aware of the excitement . As one moves toward the country and more rural areas the excitement has all but disappeared . POP The problem seems to be one of accommodating people with the pleasures and necessities of the city and at the same time offering them plenty of open green space  --  since city parks are nothing more than tiny breathing places or overly synthetic versions of the real thing and they also make it tremendously difficult to forget the city ( if that be their function ) for the simple fact that they were conceived in the midst of horrendous skyscrapers . p. 28 MOM Skyscrapers , too , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the need for space than with any consideration for the human being . Hence when the day 's work is done , there is a terrible conglomerate of people pushing their way out of the base of each building and rushing to more rural developments . POP The obvious alternative to this radial concept seems to be what might be called the " linear city " or the " universal city . " As an example the city would stretch in a line from the tip of Maine to the tip of Florida and be no wider than a mile . The city would stop immediately at its mile width , at which point the country would commence . This would allow any citizen with the ability to use his or her legs to walk from the midst of the city into the midst of the country . MOM Unexcelled transportation systems would be put into use for the traversing of the city 's length . An underground system traveling at the speed of two hundred miles an hour . An overhead system traveling at the rate of four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much like conveyor belts , would stretch from Florida to Maine and be in perpetual motion twenty-four hours a day , seven days a week . One belt moving at the rate of four miles per hour , the other at eight miles per hour .
