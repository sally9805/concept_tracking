In colonial days , Brazilians consid ered it an act of patriotism to refuse to pay taxes to their Portuguese masters . Such patriotism dies hard . Last year , in fact , after 143 years of independence , more than half of Brazil 's 200,000 self-employed doctors , lawyers , small busi nessmen and farmers still refused to file tax returns , and the government figures that 95% of those who did file cheated . Indeed , had it not been for the compulsory withholding taxes taken out of wage earners ' paychecks , the gov ernment might well have used up its entire income tax receipts just to pay the salaries of its tax collectors . But then until last year , tax evasion was not even a crime . <P> Exterior Signs . It is now . Aware that unbalanced government budgets were a key factor in Brazil 's rampaging inflation , President Humberto Castello Branco and his revolutionary military regime rammed through a tough universal income-tax law that set realistic tax rates* streamlined the archaic collection system , made tax dodgers liable to two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orlando Travancas , 47 , a reform-bent tax official who has weeded out dishonest inspectors , set up a school to train new ones , and installed ten computers to keep track of returns . <P> Under the new law , Travancas ' men also have the right to search for " exterior signs " of wealth-which might indicate , for example , that the owner of a $75,000 Copacabana Beach apartment really earned more than the $2,000 he declared on his tax form . At present , revenue agents are combing through membership lists in yacht and race-track clubs , checking the resources of Brazilian tourists abroad . Hostesses who once boasted about their cuisine now beg society columnists not to mention the delicacies served at their dinners . <P> Rumbled Warning . The first real test of the new system came last month , the deadline for filing 1965 tax returns . The results were almost unbelievable . Not only were internal revenue offices jammed with unprecedented numbers of Brazilians , but most of them actually seemed to be paying up . After a preliminary check , Travancas triumphantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that 500,000 new taxpayers had been added to the rolls . Furthermore , he rumbled , " I know very well who has lied on his income tax statement . " <P> All of which led Brazilians to call their new tax boss " Travancas the Terrible . " " I am not terrible , " he protests . " I just want to enforce the law . " To most of his countrymen , that is terrible enough . <P> <P> - From 12% of taxable income above $1,740 to 50% above $25,300 per year .
