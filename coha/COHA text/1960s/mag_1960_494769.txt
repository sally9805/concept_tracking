DECEMBER 19 , 1960 abandoned his questionable tactics of maneuver , of in ? direction . Instead of negotiating , at a time when he has the power to do so , he follows a tortuous path full of ambushes and uncertainties . Since November 4 , however , he has at last emerged from his state of immobilization ; he has taken the offensive against all opposition ; he has staked his life ; he has hurled defiance . Above all , he is the first French Chief of State since 1830 , the date of the Algerian conquest , who has referred to an Algerian Republic as an entity separate from France , thus severing the umbilical cord which , in the eyes of the men who on May 13 , 1958 , swept him , de Gaulle , to power , united the two countries . I am compelled to recognize that this French General is fighting against the Army ; that this man of the Right nonetheless is holding out in opposi ? tion to the colonialist beliefs of the French reactionaries and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a fact that General de Gaulle has already conceded ? albeit only in principle ? almost all the objectives of the Algerian nationalists . The military aims of the latter have been in part achieved . And this is why , at thistime , I can not see that any interest would be served in having France condemned by the UN . During the discussion to which I alluded at the beginning of this article , an Englishman asked me if I did n't feel that it was precisely the threat of the CM ? nese and the Russians ( who are offering to aid the Algerians ) which finally made de Gaulle decide to act . Very possibly . Similarly , the action of the opposition in France , and the agitation provoked by the friends of Jean-Paul Sartre , could very well have influenced him . Similar pressures may also have been brought to bear since by the United States , through public opinion , or through diplomatic channels , within NATO , for exam ? ple . However , this should in no way be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectiveness whatsoever . I am not hostile to pressure of this sort , I am simply skeptical as to the effects of UN condemna ? tion . And above all , I believe that the UN would lead itself into an impasse and not advance the solution of the Algerian problem by a single step , while at the same time provoking in France a reaction which could only be chauvinistic . Early last year , it became apparent that the economic revival following the steel strike would not be so vig ? orous as had been anticipated . It did not take the expectation of an actual drop in activity to start a stream of professional and amateur economists beating the drums for growth . Among the more competent and respected statements on this question were two pub ? lished in The New Republic ? the first ( July 25 ) by James Tobin of Yale , who is Director of the Cowles Foundation for Research in Economics and is listed as one of the President-elect 's advisers ; the second by Senator Paul H. Douglas and Howard Shuman ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the first place , that both the Tobin and Douglas-Shuman articles use the data on our Gross National Product ( total spending on goods and services ) in a manner which must cause apprehension among the skillful , conscientious civil servants who compile these statistics . Both attribute to these figures only an " ap ? proximate reliability . " Nevertheless , they contrast growth rates over periods of years of 2.4 percent per year with 3.2 percent and refer to growth of .7 percent per year per capita . The Gross National Product accounts do give us an indispensible framework for analysis of economic de ? velopments . However , the development and mainten ? ance of these data require making use of source ma ? terials of dubious accuracy . The struggle to improve the GNP accounts makes it necessary to revise back data periodically . Calculated growth trends might appear quite different if , for example , the statistical under ? pinning for current estimates of spending on consumer services and on construction that is put in place was strengthened . How we account for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of numerous gov ? ernment employees , also , could change the " history of growth " appreciably . An even greater problem is presented by the need to adjust current dollar figures for the changes in the price level . For example , price indexes , ordinarily , make no THE NEW REPUBLIC allowance for the introduction of new and better prod ? ucts . As a result , the " deflated " or " constant dollar " data on GNP tend to understate the true growth in the economy . When Mr. Tobin says that " the prices of goods and services needed for government activity . . . rose relative to the prices of consumption goods and services , " he calls attention inadvertently to one aspect of this problem of adjusting for price changes . Much of the government " product " goes into GNP in terms of the wages and salaries paid to government employees . There is no allowance here for a rise in productivity , al ? though in many instances such increases unquestion ? ably do occur . The accuracy of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are made to push these series back into history . The official series on GNP starts in 1929 . Over the past 31 years vast improvements have been made in the development of source materials . Prior to the Great Depression there was much less interest in the collection of data . Forty years ago there were no figures on national employment which compare reasonably with those we have today . Fifty years ago there were no income tax statistics , which now provide " benchmarks . " And so when W. W. Rostow , in his Stages of Economic Growth , analyzes the constant dollar growth rate for a number of differ ? ent nations for periods as early as the middle of the 18th Century , credulity is stretched beyond the break ? ing point for many economists . Yet for all one might say about the questionable nature of the data used in calculating growth trends , the tables for 1897 and the intervening years have been given wide distribution and are in common use . Most writers on growth have concentrated on the selection of a rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Historical ? ly this appears to be something over 3 percent . In recent years it has been less . Rockefeller , Kennedy and Tobin have suggested a 5 percent growth rate as the target for the future . Even 6 percent has been spoken of . We are told that the Russian growth rate has been 7 per ? cent , though it is easier , of course , for the Russians to achieve a high rate of economic growth because of the low base from which they are progressing and because the Soviet leaders have the power to restrain consump ? tion by fiat . It should be remembered also , that if sta ? tistics are to be used as weapons in the Cold War they can be custom-built to serve this end . Senator Douglas and Mr. Shuman " think it safer to shoot initially for a slightly lower figure than 5 per ? cent . . . The brilliant Otto Eckstein has concluded that with proper governmental policies we can raise . . . an ? nual growth rate to 4.5 percent a year . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and without any change in our basic institutions . " They point out that a 4.5 percent growth rate would give us a GNP in 1975 of $975 billion , as contrasted with $715 billion if the rate were only 2.5 percent . This compares with a current level of $505 billion . Are figures of this sort meaningful ? Do they tell us anything more than that we can expect total produc ? tion to be much higher fifteen years hence than it is now , and that the faster the economy grows the more rapidly the base for future expansion widens ? Does our vision of the future come into clearer focus when current production figures are projected through the use of the compound interest table in " 1959 dol ? lars " ? We will not have 1959 dollars in 1975 . Prices on identical items will have changed and the largest share of the nation 's product will not be identical . There is another approach to the adequacy of the current level of production which does not depend upon the calculated growth rate . Both Tobin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and productive facilities . The writers of both articles realize that com ? pletely full employment is not a reasonable goal and they do not advocate that an attempt be made to achieve it . However , unemployment , defined as the number of persons without jobs who are actively seek ? ing work , has been running at a rate of 5 to 6 percent in recent months ? well above the 3 percent figure that both Douglas and Tobin appear to consider optimum . Both authors are aware , too , that most of the nation 's basic industries which operated near practical capacity in several earlier postwar years now possess ample facilities to expand output . Even without the growth-rate legerdemain , therefore , it may be agreed that na ? tional output could be increased substantially ' from recent levels . The question is , should public policy be directed toward this end , and , if so , in what manner ? Different Roads to Growth Many conservatives still assert that any deliberate at ? tempt to raise the level of economic activity will be self-defeating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relapse . In other words , they believe the cure is worse than the disease and might even increase its virulence . One might dis ? agree with this " value judgment " but one can not dis ? prove it . Such views are of the same cloth as Eckstein 's assertion that " proper governmental policies can raise this annual growth rate to 4.5 percent a year . . . with ? out any appreciable increase in price or wage levels . " Other conservatives agree that public policy should be directed toward increasing the growth rate , but their specific recommendations are quite different from those of Tobin and Douglas . Some would drastically revise the method of taking depreciation , reduce the high bracket income tax rates or restrict union activi ? ties . These and similar proposals are constantly being , offered as means by which the US growth rate could be stepped up to compare more favorably with that of Russia . The point I wish to make is that acceptance of the idea that the rate of growth has slowed does not take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both Tobin and Douglas advocate that additional re ? sources be devoted to public needs . Tobin lists " edu ? cation , basic and applied research , urban redevelop ? ment , resource conservation and development , trans ? portation and other facilities . " Douglas emphasizes de ? fense and education . Now , Senator Douglas was a professor before he entered the Senate , and twelve years in that body have convinced him ( if he needed convincing after serving in the Chicago City Council ) that broad legislative pro ? grams can not be presented to the two houses of Con ? congress and swallowed whole . He knows that , in normal times , each new spending proposal will be considered separately . Tobin , on the other hand , suggests that " we resolve to increase to 25 percent the government share of total output . " One might ask , " Why not 20 percent or 3o percent ? " But that is not the real point . Do we really want our political leaders to select a cer ? tain percentage of GNP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this total among the various programs ? Or do we desire that each proj ? ect and program be weighed on its merits ? Mr. Tobin does not discuss defense which accounts for about half of the current federal budget . It is a curious omission in view of the present concern over the state of this nation 's military preparedness . Defense expenditures , including foreign aid , have held at the $45 billion rate for the past three fiscal years . The budget for fiscal 1961 presented last January called for a continuance at this rate . The Administration has steadfastly resisted all attempts to increase this dollar ceiling . Recently , it has been indicated by the Secretary of Defense and by the President himself that the situa ? tion is being re-examined . Senator Symington 's com ? mittee has re-examined it and made a report to the President-elect . Various programs for more aircraft and missiles , more research , faster modernization of the ground forces , more extensive anti-submarine facilities and civil defense could require expenditures which would total tens of billions of dollars annually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " fat " total defense outlays will rise substantially in the months and years ahead . On the other hand , it is conceivable that the hopes of all mankind for disarmament will be realized in the near future . In that case , the defense budget might be reduced by tens of billions . Let us say no more on the matter of defense except to suggest that the reader keep in mind the possibility that changes in this sector could completely upset any long-run plans for government expenditures and revenues , surpluses or deficits . Encouraging Private Investment Tobin also wants to increase private investment . He suggests that we " resolve " to increase this segment of spending to 18 percent of GNP . He proposes to do this by lowering interest rates and making credit " readily available , " by easing further the provisions in the Reve ? nue Code under which individuals may average their incomes over a period of time for tax purposes , and by providing tax rebates for corporations whose outlays for capital goods exceed a " specified minimum which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of the net income before tax . " How does Tobin know that this program would stimulate investment sufficiently to bring it up from 15 to 18 percent of GNP ? If his program were pre ? sented on an " other things equal " basis one might merely draw back in admiration at his ability to eval ? uate the impact of such changes with precision . How ? ever , one 's imagination is strained by the third element in his plan . Tobin wishes to restrict consumption by increasing income taxes , social security taxes and prop ? erty taxes , and by limiting " to a reasonable proportion of sales " the deductibility of advertising and promo ? tional expenses . He would increase taxes not merely to cover higher government spending but to create a sur ? plus , and so release resources for private investment . One might think from Tobin 's analysis that private investment has not been substantial in recent years . Actually , total private fixed investment has averaged close to 15 percent of GNP in the past 15 years as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year of the 1920 's . This year , 1960 , capital outlays will be substantially above last year and will approximate the postwar average . The upswing in capital investment since the 1958 recession low has been impressive , but it has not been so vigorous as the 1954-57 rise , largely because the level of demand for final products and the profit poten ? tial for new investments does not suggest to business managements that additional investments are desirable at the present time . As noted earlier , capacity is com ? fortably adequate in virtually all lines , and during 1960 demand has fallen short of expectations . Some observ ? ers suggest that we have entered a period of " over-saving " now that the most urgent needs of consumers have been satisfied . Under these conditions , can it be possible that the meager carrots that Tobin offers the potential investor would induce much additional investment , particularly when he couples this with a proposal to restrict con ? sumption by raising consumer taxes ? The Douglas Shuman view , that " increased investment can best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mand , " seems more reasonable . Profit margins are high when facilities are operating near capacity . Under such circumstances investment plans tend to be revised upward even in the face of higher interest rates . The Government Surplus Let us consider now the governmental surplus that Tobin wishes to engineer by raising taxes more than expenditures . This nation has had a run of cash sur ? pluses at various times in the past , for example , in the 1920 's and in the early years of the Truman Adminis ? tration . But these surpluses were not the result of higher tax rates , which were , in fact , reduced during these periods . Rather , economic growth created higher incomes and produced enough revenue to create a surplus . Is Tobin 's program for tax increases large enough to produce a surplus politically feasible ? Mr. Tobin believes that a budget surplus will clear the way for increased private investment . His approach to the matter is puzzling . A surplus in and of itself simply means that government receipts have exceeded expenditures over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retire debt . But it obtains this cash from the public . Therefore , the net result of a surplus used to retire debt is to remove government securities from the hands of the public . This destruction of liquid as ? sets , of course , tends to restrict private spending . Mr. Tobin says " the surplus must , to be sure , be coupled with measures to stimulate investment , so that the national resolution to save actually leads to capital formation and is not wasted in unemployment and un ? requited loss of consumption . " This is an odd way to put it . Really , the cause and effect runs the other way . High level spending and investing in the private sector produces the surplus . There will be no surplus unless private capital formation occurs in large volume and unemployment is at relatively low levels . Referring to his general program for easy money , higher taxes and higher expenditures , Mr. Tobin states , " The policies outlined above must be combined in the right proportions , so that aggregate demand is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not higher . There are several mixtures which can do the job ; of them we must choose the one that gives the desired composition of aggregate demand . " In another place he says , " Let people earn the incomes associated with a 2.5 percent rise in output per capita , and .. . keep their consumption from rising faster than i per ? cent ... . " Presumably , he knows of " several mixtures " to do this as well . As an economist who has spent 15 years in the vine yard , I am awestruck by Mr. Tobin 's confidence . He knows how to determine monetary policy , tax rates and government spending programs so as to keep the unemployment rate at 3 percent , to provide a 2.5 per ? cent rise in output per capita and to permit consump ? tion to rise by z percent per year ! If only he had given one of these " mixtures , " I for one would give up house and home to follow in his footsteps . I. would like only to suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four and one-half million business firms , thousands of private financial institutions and 5o million households . These entities have an annoying habit of raising or lowering their spending sights in the short-run . This is one rea ? son why it is difficult to " plan " deficits or surpluses in particular years . Between fiscal 1959 and fiscal 196o , for example , the United States Treasury went from a $13 billion deficit to a $1 billion surplus , almost entirely because of an increase in revenues attributable to a rise in pri ? vate spending . Advance estimates of the amount of surplus or deficit often have been billions of dollars off the mark in the postwar years . If the economy continued to operate at a high level without recessions or periods of " surplus capacity , " the present tax rate structure could be counted upon to produce a surplus . There would be no need for higher rates as Mr. Tobin proposes . The nature of tax systems in general and the progressive income tax in particular means that tax collections tend to rise much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A final word . Both Tobin and Douglas argue for a faster rate of economic growth and for an increase in government expenditures . These are separate problems . If there is an excessive volume of unused resources , most economists would agree that steps should be taken to eliminate this waste through the use of monetary and fiscal policy . Increasing the government share of GNP is another matter . Tobin writes that , " The overriding issue of political economy in the 1960 's is how to allocate the national output . " It is difficult to see how this can be the case when a substantial volume of resources remains idle . Moreover , it can not be assumed that the product to be obtained from unemployed resources should necessar ? ily be directed to the public sector . A higher level of private expenditures always can be promoted through easier monetary policy and tax reductions . Fortunately or unfortunately , the process of allo ? cating the national output will continue to be deter ? mined by the " uncoordinated decisions and habits of millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it or not . Though I should add that this criticism does not apply to what Senator Douglas and Mr. Shuman have written .
