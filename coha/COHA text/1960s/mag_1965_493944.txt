More Lost Indians A Trip to the Sioux Country by James Ridgeway Pine Ridge , South Dakota Pine Ridge Reservation is a 5,000-square-mile expanse of rolling prairie and badlands along the bottom tier of South Dakota where the Oglala Sioux were finally penned up after battling the US cavalry across the plains . It is one of the biggest reservations in the country . Ten thousand Sioux live spread out along the creek bottoms , or in one of the half-dozen little settlements . The largest of these is the village of Pine Ridge , which has a population of 2,000 . Most of the people still live in one- or two-room shacks , or if they are lucky in one of the frame houses built by public housing . This is the seat of the superintendent of the Bureau of Indian Affairs , which runs a large school . Up on the hill , the Public Health Service maintains a free hospital . There are no regular restaurants or motels at Pine Ridge , but you can get a meal at the Red Wing Cafe . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Break Tepee ' ' or the " Sioux Anthem . " The older Indians , who mostly dress as cowboys , creak into town in their beaten up cars in the early morning , and hang around the Indian Bureau or the headquarters of the Oglala Sioux tribe where Enos Poorbear , the president , has his office . Sometimes a tribal council is in session which provides entertainment , but more likely they will wander into the tribal court , where minor crimes are tried . Major crimes are tried in federal court . The day I stumbled into this narrow courtroom ( it smells heavily of lavatory disinfectant and the windows are obscured by barbed wire ) , Judge Wop Ladeau , a short , white-haired man who appeared to be missing most of his teeth , was sprawled out across the top of his bench . His mouth was wide open and he listened in fascination as Betty Fire Thunder described how Ella Thunder Bull created disorder at the Allen school where Betty had peacefully been popping popcorn one night prior to a dance . Ella suddenly burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Betty of making faces at her , and then yelled , " I am going to knock the shit out of you . " But Ella got sidetracked and tried to beat up Agnes Bad Wound instead , and the worst that happened was that the women were made to dance with people they did not like . The court spent the better part of the afternoon pondering this matter and was in recess when I left . Numerous defense attorneys were wandering around the place , although as it turned out anyone could be a defense attorney and it was a good way to pick up $8 , the fee for taking a case . The main idea was to trick the prosecuting attorney , a harried looking woman , by getting rid of her material witnesses . Both the court and the tribal council are conducted in English and Lakota , the native tongue . The Indians have a certain fondness for the late President Kennedy and his brother , Robert . They have letters of the former which they would like to sell , the price being right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bungled management is laid before the latter , he will clean everything up . ( They apparently are referring to his role as Attorney General . ) The Oglala Sioux are regarded as the great masters of passive resistance . They pay no attention to foolish ideas corning from outside . A local school teacher took charge of the local civil defense effort and tried to get the Indians to build bomb shelters ; they paid little heed . In a fury , he put around the story that while one in every 17 Americans was a Communist , the rate at the reservation was considerably higher . His efforts ended in failure . The government still views the Indians on reservations as wards who one day will improve themselves enough to manage their own affairs . This is - goal which amuses the older Sioux , since to them the government people are servants ; the goods and services dispensed are part of the price paid for land taken away in the wars of the last century . They act like exiled European aristocrats , in this case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black Hills ? the prized possession that was granted them in 7868 in return for a promise to live on reservations and stop molesting white settlers . Then gold was discovered in the hills , and they were taken away in 1877 . A claim for their return was begun with Charles Evans Hughes in the 1920 's and endures still in the Indian Claims Commission where after perhaps another five years of argument it may be decided . At best , each member of the different Sioux tribes could hope for not much more than a few thousand dollars , and even that is an uncertain prospect . Since the turn of the century , the government sought first to drive the younger and talented Indians off the reservations , and then , more recently , to lure themaway , in the hope of intermingling them with white people and thereby getting rid of this unpleasant problem altogether . A residue , however , remained , and it has now sprouted into a sort of inexperienced , and uneducated middle class that is trying to govern a population of old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are decided in the elected tribal council . They teeter constantly on the brink of despair , represented by the whisky bottle ; what energy and hope for the future they may have is generated largely through Richard Schifter , the tribe 's Washington lawyer , who helped them get through a public housing project , and more recently brought in half a million dollars of poverty funds Going Away to School The Bureau of Indian Affairs pursues a policy of improving education and at the same time developing the economic base of the reservations . While the Bureau maintains elementary day schools in various settlements scattered around the reservation that are accessible to most of the students , it runs only one high school at Pine Ridge . The school bus only goes out nine miles from town , and therefore a good many of the thousand or so students board . The school is modern and the dormitories look pleasant enough , ? a lot pleasanter than the little shacks out on the prairie ; nonetheless , the Bureau school is a hangover from a policy pursued at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to deal with the Indians would be to take the children away , put them in boarding schools , and civilize them that way . This did not stop Indians from being Indians , but it did contribute to the breakdown of the Indian family . One teacher told me the main difference in dealing with Indian children was the family 's absolute dread of education . They knew it was meant to break up the family . Large numbers of children now drop out of eighth grade rather than go away to high school . Children at Pine Ridge are above the national level in achievement at the fourth-grade level , hold their own up to the eighth grade , and then abruptly slide downhill . This is the time when they must go on to high school , and when the bleakness of their chance in life dawns on them . There is no school board , so that the parents have little reason to take an interest in education . An increasing number of youngsters are finishing high school , however , and are going on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relocation program , and last year it assisted 215 people to get out to West Coast cities , usually Los Angeles or Oakland , finding them lodging , getting them into job training , and practically guaranteeing them jobs . Most of the trainees are between 18 and 25 . Still the ties to the reservations are strong and about 40 percent come back . The reservation school system may have improved some in recent years , but teachers complain that their graduates can not express themselves very well . Last year 17- and 18-year-olds were put to reading The New York Times , but it was over their heads , and the project was dropped . The Indian Bureau 's economic development policies at Pine Ridge are fairly recent and as of now have not produced much new enterprise . About half the work force is unemployed . Families are large . The mean annual family income is below $000 . In the lean months of February and March , one-third of the reservation population is on welfare . Much of the reservation is rangeland . Indians always have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have ranched off and on , and by the end of the last war a large cattle association flourished . Then the members got greedy and broke up the common cattle herd for individual gain . The enterprise floundered . About half the rangeland now is rented to white ranchers . Small portions of farmlands are mostly leased out . Periodically there is talk of starting ranching again in a big way but the cost ; are high and the profits slender . The Sioux also have worked in the past as migrant laborers , but machinery has cut back this employment . A fish-hook factory came on the reservation in 1960 , and while the labor turnover was heavy during the first two years , workers have now settled down and have proved to be adept . But at peak periods it employs only 240 people . One out of every four tourists who come through South Dakota is supposed to tow trailer behind his car , and the Indian Bureau has been working to build campsites to attract them . There are no restaurants or motels on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economic development office at Pine Ridge , has a master plan for capturing a big share of the tourist business that is bringing South Dakota $170 million a year and by 1970 is expected to produce revenues of $700 million . Nye hit on the idea of building a replica of old Fort Phil Kearney , which in 1866 was put up on the Bozeman Trail in what is now Wyoming . The great Sioux chief , Red Cloud , burned it two years later . Nye has the plans for the fort , and when the replica is finished , the old cavalry headquarters will be a restaurant ; the guests can stay in the officers ' and enlisted men 's quarters which will be a motel . The old trading center will become a museum and an arts and crafts center . And the supply sheds will house a factory where the arts and crafts can be made . Each summer Sioux pageant will be put on to entertain the guests . This project , Nye estimates , might cost half a million dollars . It might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more plausible scheme involves making use of the large clay deposits on the reservation . Clay can be used to make pipes that can be used in diversion projects under way along the Missouri River . Richard Schifter in Washington is talking with businessmen about setting up an operation under the new Economic Development Administration , which makes cheap loans . A major difficulty at Pine Ridge is to keep what little money there now is on the reservation from flowing off . The tribe insists on prohibition on the reservation , thereby guaranteeing profits for saloon keepers at nearby White Clay , Nebraska . When lease money is paid , the Nebraska state highway patrol has been known suddenly to appear and throw up roadblocks outside the reservation , iust across state lines . Indians arrested and fined on drunk charges help to swell the community coffers , so the story goes . The tribe now is building a supermarket complex , but many Bureau employees like to shop in Nebraska where there is no sales tax , and where they can get away from Pine Ridge for . few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside the reservation . The tribe at present is suing a store owner in White Clay for unusual lending practices . He gave an Indian credit on purchases , but first made him sign a blank check on a bank where he did not have an account . The store owner then would exact small payments when he could , or in lieu of that let his debtor work it off . At last , the Indian insisted he had paid off the debt . But the store owner said no . He filled in the check , and put it through the bank . The check bounced . The sheriff was called in , and brought a criminal charge against the Indian , threatening to throw him in jail . The Lost Communities Out on the prairie there are a handful of little settlements , each one dominated by an elementary school with an adjacent row of neat frame houses where the teachers live . There is apt to be a general store run by a white . The rest of the buildings are one- or two-room log houses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned and stripped of spare parts . Some people still live in tents . Beyond these settlements , along the creek beds and down the gullies are the lost communities : Blackeyes , Red Shirt Table , Lower Medicine Root Community and Potato Creek . Here the people often are old and sickly . At Potato Creek , cluster of seven or eight shacks on a creek bottom 55 miles north and east of Pine Ridge , I met d man and his wife who were living with three children , and - until recently the woman 's diabetic mother , in d log shack about 20 feet long by 12 feet wide . The husband had once made a living on a sheep farm in Nebraska , but then he got tuberculosis . The family came back to the free hospital on the reservation . None of them works . The main electric lines run close by , but the woman said they could not pay the bills and thus did n't have electricity . Fortunately , there was a spring nearby so they did not have to drink water from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hospital at various times , being sent home with instructions on what to eat . The family lives off surplus commodities , which made the old woman constantly sick . She finally had a stroke and now was back in the hospital . For a while the man and his wife talked about the good days in Nebraska , and then the woman launched into description of what went on at the Native American Church , a rather larger shack on nearby hill . People came from miles around Saturday and stqed all night reading the Bible , beating drums and shaking gourds , and chewing peyote . The peyote itself was no good unless you had faith . If you had faith it could work incredible miracles . One time there was an old woman with sores all over her face ; they washed her face with a peyote solution and the sores disappeared . Another time a child had been born blind . Its eyelids were gray and all stuck together . The mother prayed hard , and then put . a peyote mixture into an eyedropper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and miraculously the eyes opened and the child could see . People had come from Washington and so impressed that they were going back to make peyote was used all over the country . No Power or Water Practically none of the houses on the reservation has electricity . Half of the houses are without wells nearby ; poverty program workers are discovering people hauling water 15 miles . Indoor plumbing or telephone service is rare . The Public Health Service , which runs the hospital and is in charge of a sanitation program , lumbers along under the Indian Sanitation Act which is meant to provide free water works to Indian communities . But each project for each tiny settlement must go through Congress , which means it takes three years to get approval , and no appropriations have been forthcoming recently , so the program is now at a standstill . There is . great deal of illness at Pine Ridge , and according to the sanitation experts , the quickest way to cut down on the disease rate is to get a toilet and a sink indoors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , and infectious diseases among small children are a major problem . The incidence of tuberculosis is 17 times that for the rest of the country . The life expectancy for a person at Pine Ridge is 3t3 years , compared with 62 years nationally , Because of the lack of bathing , the children commonly have bad sores on their faces . Part of this may also be due to poor nutrition . Many live on surplus commodities which are low in proteins . ( For instance , only enough dried milk is allotted per person to make four quarts of milk per month . ) Sometimes the free commodities are not eaten . A Vista worker said she was baby-sitting one night for a white family outside of Kyle , one of the small communities , when an Indian woman came to the door . She wanted to sell some commodities to get money For gas to take child to Pine Ridge , to the hospital . She apparently made a practice of this . The birthrate is one-third higher than for the rest of the nation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital at Pine Ridge , explained that if a married woman asks about birth control , she will be told , and if she wants one , will be given an intra-uterine device . The PHS does not inform people about birth control on its own . The intra-uterine device is prescribed only where the woman has had one child . As a general practice , Dr. Ogden was Teary of dealing with unmarried women ( the illegitimate birthrate is high ) , but he said each case would have to be decided on its own merits . Although the hospital has what looks to be a fairly new operating room and there is a surgeon on the staff , Dr. Ogden said the room had not been used since March because of the shortage of nurses . There were 16 positions , and he had only nine nurses on duty . People are flown to Omaha when an operation is necessary . The hospital maintains two station wagons which in the past were used as ambulances , but Dr. Ogden claims he does not have the drivers , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ruse for getting a free lift into Pine Ridge , that he is unsympathetic to their demands it be resumed . Leo Vocu , an assistant director of the local poverty program , bitterly assails the PHS on this account . He says a middle-aged man died recently of dehydration and diarrhea because the hospital refused to heed a public health nurse 's pleas to bring him in . When they did finally go out , Vocu says , it was too late ; he died on the way to the hospital . The policy of developing the economic potential of Indian reservations began with Secretary Stewart Udall . It has run for only five years , and the results are bound to be slow in coming . Steering the course is tricky business since what Udall wants to do is curiously contradictory . The talented young people whom the Bureau tries to educate and then help make go of it in the outside world are the very ones needed most at home to bring off economic development . The solution to the Indian problem still is dimly seen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will intermingle with everyone else . But the city planners are trying to figure out how to get people out of the cramped city and back into the countryside . If the Administration does not pull hard to redevelop these rural areas , it will end up merely fanning the flames in the cities .
