Flinty old John Diefenbaker , 71 , likes to parry any suggestion that he should step down as leader of Canada 's Progressive Conservative Party with a Churchillian thrust : " I 'm not going till the pub closes . " Last week , as the party gathered in Ottawa 's Chateau Laurier for its regular convention , Tory dissidents were trying their best to close the pub . <P> The oust-Diefenbaker movement centered around Dalton Camp , 46 , the party 's national chairman . An articulate Toronto advertising man , Camp blames the party 's two straight losses in national elections on Diefenbaker 's failure to appeal to the urban areas , to the Catholic French of Quebec , and to Canada 's youth . For the past two months , Camp has been openly demanding that the party call a " leadership " convention to oust the old prairie lawyer . <P> Fighting back , Diefenbaker and his forces decided to quash the rebellion by voting Camp out of office at this year 's party conference . The Diefenbaker candidate for Camp 's job was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiery oratory , which once had propelled the party to the greatest election margin in Canadian history , this time failed to rally the delegates to his cause . As the Toronto Globe and Mail put it , " The audience did n't just sit on their hands ; they checked them at the door . " <P> At the showdown , Camp comfortably retained his position with 564 votes v. 502 for Diefenbaker 's man . Next day , the delegates were even more explicit about how they felt about Diefenbaker . By a 2-to-l margin , they endorsed Camp 's proposal for a conference some time before 1968 to reconsider the party 's leadership . The timing for the conference was meant to avoid an embarrassing power struggle during Canada 's centennial celebrations next year . Diefenbaker was so outraged by the vote that he refused to make his scheduled speech at the conference 's closing dinner . As a result , the dinner itself was canceled , leaving the Chateau Laurier with 65 roasted turkeys and no one to eat them . <P> Was this the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . For one thing , the divided Tories had no one better-including Camp-to thrust onto the hustings if a new election were suddenly called . Aware of this , Diefenbaker was hardly inclined to quit . " Fight on , my men , " he urged his supporters , recalling a medieval English ballad . " I am wounded , but I am not slain . I 'll lay me down and rest a while , and then I 'll rise and fight again . "
