Byrd Man <P> Sir : <P> I have just completed reading the Aug. 17 issue of TIME containing the cover story on Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia . I congratulate you on an excellent story on the character , dedication , and principles of a man whom the nation will always remember as a truly great American . <P> I have had occasions to visit with Senator Byrd in his Washington office and have attended his annual August picnics . I can attest to the fact that if there is one man who is responsible for keeping our country from going completely socialistic since the Roosevelt era , that man would be the gentleman from Virginia . <P> <P> DONALD BALDWIN Alexandria , Va . <P> <P> Sir : <P> All his political life Senator Harry Byrd has been guided by a few simple and unchanging maxims about business and government .

Byrd : Is the axiom that the laws ought to " be enforced by the white people of this country " one of the lessons this man of reminiscences is to teach to " that attractive young fellow in the White House " ? <P> A teacher of such doctrine should be viewed with something less than absolute trust . <P> <P> ANTHONY G.

Brainerd Holmes , his team , and the progress of the United States in their efforts to reach the moon Aug. 10 . Your article shows , in a concise and easy to understand way , the problems that must be solved before the big day arrives . <P> <P> S. BRUUN-MEYER Johannesburg <P> Sir : <P> Your story on the fabulous moondoggle is possibly one of the most painful expositions of screeching insanity ever seen in print . At a time when our crushing load of taxation is stifling our industry , blocking our social progress and bringing joy to our enemies , an endless torrent of taxpayers ' dollars is being recklessly poured into an open-end inverted rathole.                   @ @
