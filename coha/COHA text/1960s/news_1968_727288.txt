txt It is the normal  --  though not unbroken  --  American political custom that the man nominated by his party for the Presidency picks his own running mate , after which the choice is dutifully ratified by the convention . . The selection of the Vice-Presidential candidate is traditionally based on the supposed need to " balance " the ticket . in as many ways as possible and all at the same time  --  the most desirable nominee usually being one who represents a different ideological wing of the party , comes from a different part of the country , emphasizes different interests and , most important , appeals to a different segment of the voting public . All this is acceptable within limits and has something to justify it in the context of the American political system , in which each of the two major parties has to embrace a wide spectrum of the body politic to remain viable . But what is not acceptable is the use of the VicePresidential nomination as nothing more than a political handle with which the prospective Presidential nominee hopes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either in the convention hall or in the subsequent election : What is not acceptable is the conception of the Vice-Presidency itself as merely a minor adjunct of the Presidential office , in which the American people have peripheral concern because it is a post of no intrinsic power . Historic experience and an increasing sophistication of the electorate lead to a rejection of this concept of the Vice-Presidency and to a growing popular insistence on two major considerations : ( 1 ) that the VicePresidential candidate be qualified to serve as President in case of a contingency that already has arisen no less than four times in this century ; and ( 2 ) that he be philosophically close enough to the head of the ticket so that the voter  --  who can not separate his Presidential and Vice-Presidential ballot  --  will not be trapped into a vote for two political leaders representing antipathetic trends of thought or totally divergent approaches to basic questions of national policy . It is incumbent on every candidate for the Presidential nomination , Republican or Democrat , to keep these considerations in mind as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in the Republican case will be reached tonight . Not one of these men can afford  --  in the hope of achieving an immediate advantage against the others at the convention or subsequently in the election  --  to show such contempt for the American voter that he would sell out his own principles for a running mate whose philosophy basically collides with his own or for one whose capacity to be President he seriously doubts . To select such a Vice-Presidential candidate , or even to try to make a deal with one , would be not only fraudulent but also self-defeating . The G.O.P. today has a fair chance of winning the election in November . The G.O.P. tomorrow will have undermined that chance if its Presidential nominee , no matter who he is , ties into the ticket as Vice President a man at the opposite pole of the party , one whose accession to the Presidency would represent the antithesis of all that his elected predecessor has stood for .                  @ @ @
