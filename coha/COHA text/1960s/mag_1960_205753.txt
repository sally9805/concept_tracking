When 150 virologists and public-health experts met in Philadelphia last week to swap shoptalk on the eastern equine encephalitis that flared in southern New Jersey last fall ( TIME , Oct. 5 ) , the conference chairman himself was the rarest of medical phenomena : a survivor of the deadly disease who had escaped brain damage . <P> Almost casually , in highly technical discussions held by the University of Pennsylvania 's School of Veterinary Medicine , it was disclosed that Chairman Richard E. Shope , 58 , virologist of the Rockefeller Institute , had become infected and the subject of a scientific first . Dr. Shope , working in Ocean County where encephalitis was raging , pitched energetically into the disease-detective work , collecting mosquitoes suspected of transmitting the virus . Inevitably , he was bitten . For a while he felt no ill effects . But during a mid-October train ride , Dr. Shope began to suffer chills ; his muscles ached and his joints hurt . Next day he asked Dr. Delphine Clarke , a fellow worker at the institute , to draw blood for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 104 , and for a week he endured spells of alternating chills . But the agonizing doubt was continuous . For if the virus attacked the brain , he would have only a one-in-three chance of surviving , and a one-in-30 chance of escaping without paralysis and with his mind unimpaired . Dr. Clarke reported proudly but sadly that she had isolated the virus from Dr. Shope 's blood . It was the first time scientists had been able to find it in the blood of a living human victim ( usually they get it only after death , from brain and other nerve tissues ) . After ten days Dr. Shope inexplicably felt better , and has remained well . <P> How fortunate he was is shown by the fate of 33 New Jersey victims : 21 died , eleven had brain damage , only one recovered fully . Once infection sets in , no treatment has any effect on the progress of EEE - or , as the experts called it more often last week , EVE , short for eastern viral encephalomyelitis . The disease is even deadlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these species by vaccination . So far , no vaccine has been approved for general use in man . Best current bet for control of EVE : identify the mosquito carriers , such as Dr. Shope was collecting , and exterminate them .
