New York is a city of wonders where a Y. A. Tittle appears just as a Charlie Conerly is beginning to campaign for Medicare , where an Earl Morrall falls gift-wrapped from the skies when Tittle departs , where a Tucker Frederickson blossoms as Alex Webster and Frank Gifford wilt and where a Pete Gogolak sends his calling card even as the team is perishing for a soccer-style Hungarian place-kicker from Buffalo . Despite the current blessings New York remains an incomplete team , as any realist can tell , but it does not pay to be overly realistic about the Giants . They have a couple of x factors going for them which defy ordinary analysis . One is that uncanny knack of picking up vital players . The other is a carryover of pride and poise from the days when the Giants were always contenders  --  the winning habit that sometimes makes a team better than it really is . Consigned to oblivion last year , the Giants got so much value from Quarterback Morrall and Halfback Frederickson that they tied Dallas for second place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the offense not all that strong  --  and still the Giants were second . // Now the Giants have Gogolak 's accurate instep and some first-class rookie linemen . They still have vulnerable points , but in the vulnerable East and with these x factors they must be accorded a certain respect . A good share of it is due Morrall , the indispensable man , who provides 11 years of experience . Morrall is a reasonably accurate drop-back passer , short and long , who can run in emergency situations . After a year 's study he knows the Giant system , and he has taken charge of the offense . Behind Morrall is scrambling , young Gary Wood . // Frederickson is No. 1 among the herd of young running backs who have been named the Baby Bulls . He was eighth in rushing last season and a candidate for Rookie of the Year honors , caught 24 passes and pleased New York with his good looks and manners . Frederickson 's young comrades in the Giant backfield are Chuck Mercein , Ernie Koy and Steve Thurlow . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially in following their blockers  --  and they are not quite quick enough to turn the corner like a Jimmy Brown , but they will do . // The Giant receivers are not especially distinguished , but they do the job in a workmanlike way . There is a faceless guy named Joe Morrison at flanker who never gets into the Jantzen ads , but it is surprising how often he has the ball in his hands when it is third and nine . Aaron Thomas at tight end catches his share , too , without fanfare . The glamour boy of the receiving corps used to be Del Shofner , in the days when he was catching Y.A . ' s bombs . Injuries and illness took him out of the news , but now he is said to be back in good form and ready to haul in the long ones . Homer Jones is the new speed boy who gets loose for long yardage every now and then . // Coach Allie Sherman is no more eager than the next coach to use rookies in his starting lineup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice . The most promising one is Francis Peay of Missouri , 250 pounds , the Giants ' No. 1 draft choice and , some say , the top offensive lineman in college last year . He starts at right tackle . At the other tackle is Don Davis of San Diego State , an even bigger rookie ( 285 pounds ) . Veterans Bookie Bolin , Greg Larson and Pete Case fill out the interior line , which will need some settling down to become reliable . // The Giant offense will not overwhelm anyone , but if history is a guide the team will score just enough points to win some close games that could go either way . Gogolak , who kicked 28 field goals for Buffalo last year while New York was racking up a grand total of four , is a timely addition . // On defense the Giants have not come close to reduplicating the shrewd , stingy platoon of the Sam Huff era . The line has been a worry ever since Sherman traded Dick Modzelewski and Rosey Grier , and while Huff was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did nothing for the Giant linebacking . End Andy Robustelli 's retirement to coach the Brooklyn Dodgers has removed another of the old dependables . End Jim Katcavage is the last of that gang still operating in the line . Trades brought in Jim Prestel at tackle and Maury Youmans at end , but Youmans ' bad knee has put him out . The other tackle position is the object of a three-way fight . // At linebacker the Giants are counting on Jim Carroll , Jerry Hillebrand , Bill Swain and Larry Vargo , all of whom can be very good on occasion . Carroll is young and a fine prospect . Olen Underwood , once in the running , was dropped . The secondary is a none-too-impressive combination of youth and experience . Henry Carr , Spider Lockhart and Phil Harris have two seasons of experience among the three of them , while Dick Lynch has played eight years and Jim Patton 11 . The 32-year-old Patton is the dean of pro defensive backs and , as such , is about due for retirement . Carr , an Olympic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ football . // As the only club besides the 49ers with an AFL rival next door , the Giants have an extra-special motivation to play winning football . The Jets have been hugely successful in Shea Stadium , and though Yankee Stadium is a near sellout for the Giants on a season-ticket basis , Giant management obviously can not afford to risk diluting the loyalty of its regulars through any letdown . // Put the Giants down for third , but be prepared to duck those xs.
