" Righteous living " was Edward Charles Ford 's stock answer when people asked him the secret of his success . That , perhaps , plus a whistling fastball , a jug-handle curve , a slider , a change-up and a " sinker " that just may have been a spitter , as scores of frustrated batters complained . <P> Wet or dry , in 18 years with the New York Yankees , " Whitey " Ford ensured himself a place among the pitchers in baseball 's Hall of Fame . He won 236 games and lost only 106 for a percentage of .690-the highest of any 200-game winner since 1900 . In 1956 and 1958 , he posted the lowest earned-run average in the American League ; in 1961 and 1963 , he led the league in victories . Lefthander Ford also rewrote the World Series record book-winning a total of ten games , striking out 94 batters , and hurling 331 consecutive scoreless innings to erase the old mark of 291 set by a onetime Boston Red Sox southpaw named Babe Ruth . <P> The son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out as a first baseman at the Manhattan High School of Aviation Trades , switched to pitching on the advice of a Yankee scout and signed with the Yanks for a $7,000 bonus in 1946 . Farmed out to the minors , he posted a 51-20 record over 3-seasons , was called up by the Yankees in mid-1950 , and promptly rattled off nine victories in a row . Professionally , Ford was the archetypical Yankee-cool , precise and confident of always winning the big game . Personally , he was a pleasure to be around ; sportswriters delighted in his availability , affability and wit . His teammates called him " the chairman of the board . " <P> Not at 38 . All that came to an end last week . " Pitching , " Whitey always said , " is not a natural act , " and over the years he was plagued by a succession of ailments common to his trade . A sore arm kept him out of action for much of 1957 and 1960 ; in 1964 and again last year , he underwent surgery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , a sharp pain in his left elbow forced Ford to quit the mound after pitching only one inning against the Detroit Tigers . Doctors traced the trouble to an inch-long bone spur in Whitey 's elbow , advised him that an operation would be necessary to clear it up . Nothing doing , said Ford . " I wo n't have another operation . If I were 33 or 34 years old , I would . But not now , not at 38 . " He chose to retire instead . <P> Whitey 's retirement will be comfortable enough . Over those 18 years , he has earned an estimated $600,000 in salary-plus $80,000 in World Series bonuses . On the side , Whitey owns an insurance agency , a couple of office buildings , a garden-apartment complex and a piece of a bank in New Hyde Park , N.Y . " I 've accomplished everything I wanted to , " he said with obvious satisfaction last week . " I came here wearing $50 suits and I 'm leaving wearing $200 suits . " Then , grinning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
