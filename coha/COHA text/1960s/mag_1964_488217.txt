It used to take years of achievement to become known to the public . Today a private person who has done something noteworthy ; or at least newsworthy , can become a public person in a few weeks . IVIass Anne W. Simon is the author of Stepchild in the Family ( Odyssey Press ) . Under the name of Anne W. Langman she has written TV criticism for The Nation . exposure , gift of the electronic era , makes it possible . The requirements are an accomplishment , a reason to talk about it , and a public relations man who knows his ' way around the studio circuit ; the result , instant fame . Going public has hazards for the Private person and for the people whose attention he now courts on the air . Only those who work the miracle know what the hazardsare , and they are not likely to tell . The business of the p.r . men , the communicators , is illusion , and they want to keep it intact , the tricks of the trade bidden from view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scrutinizing television and radio for the magazine columns I wrote , it was only in my own recent personal brush with Mass exposure that lost my innocence . It was a book I wrote , published , this spring , that put me on the electronic merry-go-round . Its subject is stepchildren and stepparents , and that ; in the jargon , is a hot one for mass exposure . My publisher says that he does not know what sells books , but he encourages authors who . have the credentials to try mass exposure and see what happens . As a result , I ranged the field , from the Today show at 7 A.M. to Contact Wins at . midnight , from a two-hour stint on Boston radio to two minutes on New York 's WABC . I was interviewed by newsman Mike Wallace and showman Mike Douglas , by Haywood Vincent and Vincent Tracy , by the ladies of Girl Talk , a minister , a disk jockey=all in all , I appeared on more than twenty television and radio programs within a month . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the publisher 's p.r . man said . With this carrot he tempts authors like me , relatively unknown private people , into going public , so that the personality cult May embrace them and the books may sell . No matter how shy , truculent , or inarticulate they may have been , many are hooked by the habit I could see that it has its undoubted pleasures , but at the end of four weeks , I fled to privacy . Admittedly , I learned a few things about speaking up , looking up , hamming it up . I can now project my personality and I no longer forget to mention the title of my bOok in the heat of discussion  --  which wins me an approving smile from my p.r . , guardian , keeping score in the control room . In less lucid moments , I even pine to start all over again . Knowing what I know now I could , I muse , be a coast-tocoast sensation . But now I also know too much about the hazards ? to me as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ego The hazards of guestmanship on the interview , the panel . the unrehearsed , informal , network chat became quickly apparent . The producer of the first TV show I did ( " Top exposure , prime time . . . " the p.r . man exulted ) briefed me . I should start by talking about my personal life , my marriage , my family , " Everybody likes to talk about themselves , " he said , smothering my objections , " and that 's what 's 220 interesting . " 1 argned the logic with him . I was there because of the book I wrote , and although I am , as its jacket states , both stepchild and stepmother , that is irrelevant to the book . In fact , the book 's validity rests precisely on its being an objective report , based on several years ' research . The stepchild subject is full of interest ; my Own experiences are neither particularly , interesting no illuminating . Last but not least is my innate distaste for talking about private affairs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage a chance remark on the air might do to any one of the assorted members of my family . The logic did n't change his expectations . Personal revelations axe the pattern followed by almost every communicator in my roster . These convictions seem to me not unusually quixotic , but to hold to the , m I had ' to be uncompromising , even monosyllabic . It was a TV star , immersing me in a mist of hair spray ( " to brighten you up a bit , dear " ) who turned my resolve to , iron . When she said that we would chat about me and my life " and all the problems you must have , " my response was a plain no . She summoned her producer to deal with this bizarre refusal . He talked to me in whispers in a corner of the stip:lip , for mine was a heresy better unadyertised . " You must talk about yourself . That 's what the show 's about . " " No , " I said , the spray still stinging my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The book , " I murmured , " maybe something in the book . Have you read it ? " " We had somebody read it , of course . What 's in it ? " It was two minutes to air time , and the show , we knew , must go on . It did . No personal questions . If there had been , I would have carried out my last-ditch threat of silence on the air which , it appeared , would have been a worse disaster than for the star and nie to talk about what I was there to talk about . My only regret in ' this victory was the sorrow I inflicted on the hardworking p.r . man , who is convinced that the maverick in the flock reflects on the competence of the shepherd , and that I had dope damage mot only ' to my own image but to his . In penance , I compromised on lesser matters . I have a low voice , and speak slowly , especially when I am trying to make sense . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a female interrogator told me during the commercial . Since there were only sixty seconds and no instructor handy , I made a Major effort to speak up , speak fast and in short sentences so that she could conveniently interrupt me when the going got dull . I was complimented all around . Np One seemed to notice that what I had said , while concentrating on delivery , made very little sense at all . Required words were even more ' distracting . It is my habit to Say point of view rather than viewpoint , art i'diosyncracy which I had hardly ever noticed until I was a guest on Viewpoint . This radio interview asks guests to include " My viewpoint is . . in their opening remarks . Luckily , the show is taped ; it took me four tries before I ? got the " view " before the " point , " by which time I could hardly summon a point or a view . EVen more disastrous is the salutation " Good Liv- ? ingr with which interviewer and interviewee must ppen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The specter of saying " Good Living ! " instead of hello , goodby , or any other common , greeting or farewell , froze my thought processes to a standstill . By the ? second week , I ' began to change my ways . The facile tongue and well-delivered phrase came more easily , fan mail increased ; I wondered when I would be tapped by David , Susskind . Tipsy with my new ability to please the communicators , I ' breezily called them by their first names when they called me by mine . Only two chose to let the audience know that we had just met , using Mr. and Mrs : as we exchanged ideas . Perhaps by chance , both interviews were unusually cogent . A novice no longer , I found it mildly funny to be told by a top entertainer , busy rehearsing a couple of song-and-dance acts , that I was Ins " intellectual segment " for the day ; tomorrow 's , be added reassuringly , was Malcolm X. Funny , too , the jovial disk jockey turned talk purveyor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoes shined and eating a sandwich hunch , the cover of my book propped up against the coffee container . " Covers are all ' I need , " he said , " I give the books away . " Just as well , perhaps . An interview- The NATION er on a coast-to-coast TV show who had actually read the hook greeted me , tears in her eyes , with " It 's all so meaningful that I 'm scared to death . " I could only answer that that made two of us , and silently congratulate myself on achieving the retort courteous twenty seconds before viewing millions would gaze upon us , one weeping , one wanting to weep . No one of these small conventions of mass exposure was important by itself . Added together , they were a considerable hazard . Changing my voice and manners and defending my principles required concentrated effort ; what I said had to take second place . In my innocent days , I had thought that ideas were the ' primary consideration on interviews . I discovered before long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve came first , That was the hazard to me in going public Another thing about which I , did not know was the hazard to the public . What is said on the air has status with the audience just because it is on the air . They listen with more faith than cynis cism . With this in mind , I was shocked ' to find myself suddenly qualified as advice giver , marriage counselor and how-to-do-it packager , although I am no one of these and the book I wrote has no such pretensions . " You 're the Dr. Speck of stepchildren , " a commentator said , intending flattery , and spent the remaining minutes of pre-air time October 12 , 1964 asking how he could get out of paying his first wife so much alimony , so as to be a better stepfather to the children of his present wife . I soon decided that everybody in mass communications was a step person . If it was not an interviewer asking how to deal with his recalcitrant stepchild , the producer was having stepmother trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left his post during the commercial break to ask if he should marry a woman whose children made him sick ? " literally , sick " he said , retreating then to the safety of his glass enclosure . I thought the jinx was broken when I went through an entire program without encountering stepchild or stepparent . But the new rule held , after all . at the close , a burly camera man descended from his hooded perch and shook my hand warmly . " Tell me , " he said , " how can I be a good stepfather when those kids ? . . . " I fled . I answered most communicators ' queries with an explanation . Mine is a journalist 's book , containing information collected about ' step relations from experts in appropri  --  te fields . I- , do perhaps know more about the whole of the subject than anyone else , because nobody has ever done this particular research ' before . But in self-protection as much as modesty , I insist that I know less about ' any one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law for the step family than the lawyers , less about its emotions than the psychiatrists . I can ' describe the step relation in its many aspects , but I can not tell anyone what to do about it . I even nurture a hope that the book might stir people to decide what ought to be done and how to do it for themselves . But the communicators were not about to be reformed by me , no matter how strongly I protested the dangers of giving or taking unqualified advice . Their off-the-air quest for advice set the tone for on-the-air questioning . Specifics of how-to-do-it were what they asked for . This , they said , is what the people want . Being asked for advice is heady wine . How long even the most humble can resist its intoxication is an open question . For me , the temptation to edge in on Dr. ? pock 's territory was strong The questions , particularly in audience-participation shows , were often poignant and compelling . If I succumbed , the pressure snowballed . Worse still , interviewers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to individual problem 's , often answered their own questions , and those from the audience , too . Whether they ' knew it or not , these show-biz personalities , blithely advising unseen millions on the complex and delicate step relation , were the only ones who could force me into advice giving . They did it more than once . I was astounded by the cruelty of the ubiquitous self-importance I witnessed A stepmother-songstress regaled me and the TV audience with ' tales of her misbehaving stepchild , whose name she revealed in pretty confusion ; " I did n't mean to tell which one of the children it is in case they 're listening in , " she smiled , and proceeded to explain how patiently she handled the troublemaker . " I 'm a good stepmother , do n't you think so ? " she asked me . A hoofer on the show came to the rescue . " How could you be , " he said , " you 're never home . " I do n't know if the how-to-do-it hunger will ever abate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if mass communication requires giving advice without authority , and if it must follow the personality cult regardless of its hazards , I prefer the safety of being a private person . Going public , in the words of one of its masters , kids me not . 221
