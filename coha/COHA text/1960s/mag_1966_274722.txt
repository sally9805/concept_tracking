Almost daily , the President hopped into his tan station wagon and drove around the 400-acre L.B.J. Ranch to gaze at his menagerie of wild deer , turkeys , antelope and buffalo . In his paneled office , Lady Bird put up a 6-ft. - high balsam tree , speckled with colored lights and topped with a golden-haired angel in a blue brocade dress . The menu for Christmas dinner called for turkey , corn-bread dressing , string beans with almonds , sweet potatoes with marshmallow topping , rolls , cranberry salad , ambrosia and angel-food cake . The family celebrated Lady Bird 's 54th birthday on Dec. 22 .

At midweek L.B.J. had to handle a highly touchy situation : nine Democratic Governors arrived to tell him what was wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

The President reacted by issuing a quiet invitation that brought to the ranch a delegation of nine Democratic Governors , led by Iowa 's Harold Hughes .

He threw a big barbecue luncheon on the lawn . He set up a full-scale press conference and , with typical attention to statistics , reeled off a count of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he became President-400 personal talks , 200 phone calls .
