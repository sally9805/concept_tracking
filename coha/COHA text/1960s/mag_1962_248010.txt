Every town in the U.S. is famous for something-just go there and ask . Mountain View , Ark. ( pop . 983 ) , makes its proudest claim as the birthplace of three businesslike brothers who have long since fled Mountain View . Luther and Howard Powell are minor captains of industry , having hewed their way directly to vice-presidencies of International Harvester and the Illinois Central Railroad . Richard took a more circuitous route , first becoming a song-and-dance man , then a movie idol , next a bullet-voiced private eye , before settling down as one of the major-and sharpest-businessmen in U.S. television . <P> Few who remember the frail , baby-faced crooner who used to prance through swarms of spangled chorines in pursuit of Ruby Keeler would have spotted Dick Powell as executive timber . But some 25 years later , as the grey-templed president of Four Star Television , Dick Powell has made himself a millionaire many times over . The current Dick Powell Show ( NBC ) , a loosely strung " anthology series " with room for a wide variety of stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won steadily good reviews and the sort of ratings that turn admen respectful . Producer Powell has scored triumphs of surprise casting : Mickey Rooney in a superb portrayal of a lonely seaman in Somebody 's Waiting , Milton Berle as a blackjack dealer in Doyle Against the House , Jack Carson as a beatnik in Who Killed Julie Greer ? Under the subtle direction of Ralph Nelson , Four Star 's Three Soldiers ( about mercenaries ) was one of the outstanding dramatic productions of the autumn , recalling the somewhat golden days of TV 's great dramatic shows . <P> Inverse Ratio . Formed ten years ago , Four Star is actually run by three stars ( Powell , David Niven and Charles Boyer ) and ex-Adman Tom McDermott . " We are one of the three largest producers of network television programming in the industry , " says Powell . " I wo n't be satisfied until we 're the biggest-and we will be . " Starting out with the old Four Star Playhouse and later booming with the five-year run of Dick Powell 's Zane Grey Theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many as 13 series running at one time . <P> Powell works so hard at the business that his success as a moneymaker has had an unhappy and inverse ratio to his success as a husband . His second wife , Joan Blondell , complained in divorcing him that he always had two big-deal telephones going at once . June Allyson , his third , filed for divorce earlier this year ( after 16 years of marriage ) with the complaint that she had become an office widow . When the Powells went cruising to Santa Catalina Island on their 56-ft. motor sailer , Dick would answer the week 's mail by Dictaphone on the way out and do little but read scripts on the way back . Betweentimes , he was busy with a variety of sidelines that included directing motion pictures ( his best so far is 20th Century-Fox 's The Enemy Below ) and campaigning for Richard Nixon . Actress Allyson reconsidered , however , before the divorce became final and Powell has resumed residence in their Beverly Hills home . <P> At 57 , Dick Powell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devote himself to being a TV executive . Says he : " It 's the vanity of the old ham . I look at myself in a TV Guide picture and say , ' Oh , those hog jowls . ' I 'm tired of trying to hold my stomach in. "
