Under Ted Baker , its penurious founder , National Airlines shielded the windows of its Miami headquarters from the sun with brown wrapping paper . When Lewis Maytag Jr. , heir to a washing machine fortune , bought Baker out 15 months ago , the first thing he did was to invest in vertical blinds . <P> The change was an augury ; National has been looking better ever since-and so have its books . For the year just ended , the earnings of the eighth largest U.S. domestic airline climbed to an estimated $6,500,000 from $4,300,000 last year . Only two years ago the line was deeply mired in losses . <P> " Bud " Maytag picked just the right time to take over . In 1961 the Civil Aeronautics Board awarded National the lucrative Southern transcontinental " rocket run " linking the aerospace centers of Cape Canaveral , Houston and the West Coast . Sensing a good opportunity , Maytag , who was then running the Rocky Mountains ' local Frontier Airlines , bought Baker 's 250,000 shares for $6,400,000 with family help . <P> Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 years than any other major U.S. airline president . Grandson of the Maytag who started the washing machine empire , he is the first to admit : " I am not a self-made man . " <P> After attending Colorado College , he set up his own flying school in Colorado Springs , later bought control of Frontier . Maytag put money-losing Frontier into the black during his four years there , but ran into CAB opposition to his plan to discontinue service to half of the points served by Frontier . He concedes that his initial naivete about the airlines business cost him endless head aches . He sold Frontier to go National . <P> Maytag brought along his four-man executive team from Frontier to help run National , set out to shine up the line 's somewhat tarnished reputation . National executives , who had grown gun-shy under terrible-tempered Ted Baker , found themselves with freely delegated authority . Maytag modernized National 's fleet ( now nine DC-8s , 17 Electras ) , eased the debt burden by arranging new financing , and prettied up the stewardesses with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily the most outspoken chief executive in the airlines industry . He is against airline mergers because he feels that they weaken competition , ardently protests the Government 's tight regulation . " About the only thing left under the airlines ' control , " he says , " is schedules . " He is equally critical of his fellow airline presidents for not opposing Government intrusion and union demands more vigorously . " The heads of many airlines are living in the past , " he says . " The airline industry is now a sophisticated business , but too many of the guys running airlines are the same ones who started the open-cockpit mail runs . " He calmly took on Pan American President Juan Trippe , forcing him to return 390,000 shares that Pan Am had acquired in a swap during a 1958 merger maneuver that came to naught .
