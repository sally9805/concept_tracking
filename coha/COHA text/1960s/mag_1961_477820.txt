AS President Kennedy 's program unfolded after January 20 , the financial storm flags that had gone up during and after the campaign came down abruptly . The outflow of gold , which had been nourished by campaign talk about easy money and big budgets , came to a halt . This was the financial world 's way of saying that it regarded the program as moderate and not very different from what the Republican program would have been . It looked as if both parties had something to cheer about : the Democrats had their man , the Republicans had their program . But it would scarcely be fair to the President 's advisers , whose views arc well known , to assume that a few months in office have fundamentally changed their minds . Their problem is that the gold flow is not just a barometer . It is a positive check . The United States can not afford a program that would undermine confidence in the dollar . It puts the Administration 's economists in the position of Oscar Wilde 's French-speaking Englishman , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could say . If and when the gold situation permits , their economic pronouncements will probably recover the familiar ring . This ring has been made familiar by the writings of J. K. Galbraith , Seymour Harris , Arthur Schlesinger , Jr. , Alvin Hansen , and others . It rejects our ancient American folklore that politicians spend too much . In its place it puts the intriguing notion that they spend too little . Public needs are underfinanced while private tastes are overindulged ? that is the proposition . The two parts of the proposition seem neatly to complement each other ? too much of one , therefore too little of the other . In fact they do n't . It is one thing to be irritated by certain manifestations of our contemporary civilization ? the gadgets , the chrome , the tailfins , and the activities that go with them . It is quite another ? and something of a non sequitur ? to conclude from this that the only alternative to foolish private spending is public spending . Better private spending is just as much of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of " public vs. private " is to confuse the issue . More than that , it is to confuse means and ends . The choice between public and private money is primarily a choice of means . The sensible approach for those who are dissatisfied with some of the ends to which private money is being spent , is to specify first what other ends are important and why . Having determined the ends , the next step is to look to the means . That is the order in which I propose to proceed here . What Is Wrong with Private Spending ? One may share the irritation of the new social critics as they look upon some of the fluff and the floss on our standard of living . My personal feelings can be characterized by noting that I have a 1951 car and no TV . The critics may want to bear in mind , however , that not all the money in this country is spent by people for whom life begins at $25,000 . The median family income is $5,600 . Would these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much less than that ? When Galbraith inveighs eloquently against switchblades , narcotics , and other phases of juvenile delinquency , he deserves the support of all right-thinking representatives of what he calls the " conventional wisdom . " But are the sources of these aberrations more intimately tied to affluence or to poverty ? The exponents of the new social criticism may also want to remember the outcome of that " noble experiment , " Prohibition . It should have taught us that it is futile to become our brother 's dietitian . I hope that it has also imbued us with wholesome doubt about the moral right of some members of the community to regulate the lives of the rest . Irritation with the poor judgment of other people who fail to appreciate one 's own more advanced tastes is not new . It was a familiar situation during the 1920s . The critics then quoted T. S. Eliot 's The Waste Land , and some went off to Paris in search of greener cultural pastures . The feeling behind the new social criticism is not dissimilar . Hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cultural direction . One might expect the critics of contemporary materialism to plead for more intensive preoccupation with things of the mind , Some fits and starts in that direction there have been , to be sure . But they have not been in the main stream of the movement . The principal alternative to private materialism that has been offered to us has been public materialism . Signs of Quality Obviously , the quality of our culture could be greatly improved by public expenditures for education and support of the arts . The sales of good paperbacks and T.Ps are encouraging signs . But if contemporary materialism is to be leavened by such pursuits . it will be principally because large numbers of individuals make private decisions to that end . Social criticism is constructive if it helps precipitate these decisions . It obstructs a desirable evolution if it suggests that public creature comforts are the only alternative to private . But while emphasis on nonmaterial ends seems sadly lacking in the new social criticism , the critics are right in pointing out that new material needs also have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? even though they mislabel them as public needs . In the good old days , when this was still a nation of farmers , most people had no serious retirement worries , there was no industrial unemployment problem , good jobs could be had without a college degree , most diseases were still incurable ? in short , social security , education , and health care found primitive and natural solutions within the family and among the resources of the neighborhood . Today , these solutions are neither adequate nor usually even possible . Meanwhile mounting wealth and advancing technology have brought within reach the means of meeting these needs . We can afford to live better in every way ? more creature comforts , more leisure , more attention to matters of the mind and the spirit . At the same time we can take better care of retirement , of unemployment . of illness , of education , of the possibilities opened by research , than ever before . There are indeed new needs . The citizen-taxpayer has his choice of meeting them , as well asall his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can buy the goods or services he wants privately , for cash or credit . Or he can buy them from the government , for taxes . The nation as a whole pays taxes to buy public services as it pays grocery bills to buy groceries . The tax burden may be heavier for some individuals than for others . But the nation as a whole has no more reason to complain about the " burden " of taxes than about the " burden " of grocery bills ? and no more reason to hope for relief . Of the two stores , the private store today still is much the bigger . The public store is smaller , but it is growing faster . Each store has some exclusive items . The private store sells most of the necessities and all of the luxuries of life , and in most of these has no competition from the government side . The public store has some specialties of its own : defense , public order and justice , and numerous local services that the private organization has not found profitable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both stores : provision for old age , health services , education , housing , development of natural resources . The New Needs The bulk of the new needs are in this competitive area . The fashionable notion is to claim them all for the public store and to label them public needs . The statistics say otherwise . They say in fact two things : First , the supply of this group of goods and services has expanded very rapidly in recent years ; and second , they are being offered , in varying degrees , both by the private and the public suppliers . Let its run down the list . Provision for old age is predominantly private . The average American family , realizing that while old age may be a burden , it is the only known way to achieve a long life , takes care of the matter in three ways : ( 1 ) by private individual savings ? home ownership , savings deposits , securities : ( 2 ) by private collective savings ? life insurance , corporate pension funds ; and ( 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report that the two collective forms are advancing faster than the individual . The increases far exceed the rise in the Gross National Product of almost 80 per cent ( in current prices ) over the past ten years ; they do not indicate either that these needs are neglected or that they are necessarily public in character . Education : the bulk of it is public ; but a good part . particularly of higher education , is private . Total expenditures for all education have advanced in the last ten years from $9.3 billion to $24.6 billion ( $19.3 billion of it public ) . Education 's share in the national income has advanced from 3.8 per cent to 5.8 per cent . The silly story that we spend more on advertising than on education is a canard , though with its gross of over $10 billion , advertising does take a lot of money . Health expenditures are still mainly private . At considerable expense , it is now possible to live longer and be sick less frequently or pt least less dangerously . In the past . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health care for the indigent has always been provided by public action or private philanthropy . Since the war , the proliferation of health insurance has given some form of collective but private insurance to three-quarters of our 182 million people . This has greatly reduced pressure for a national health service along British lines . For the aging , whose health-care needs stand in inverse proportion to their capacity to pay or insure , public insurance has finally been initiated and needs to be expanded . The total annual expenditure on health is estimated at over $25 billion , a little more than on education . Of this , about $6 billion is public . So much for the allegation that the " new needs " are all public needs . Now for some further statistics on the public store , which is said to have been neglected . Some of them could make an investor in private growth stocks envious . Research expenditures ( mainly for defense and atomic energy ) have gone from about $1 billion to over $8 billion in the last ten years . Federal grants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion during the same period . Social-security benefits rose from $1 billion to over $10 billion . All in all , public cash outlays ( federal and state ) advanced from $61 billion to $134 billion over ten years , 57 per cent faster than the GNP . For those who feel about public spending the way Mark Twain felt about whiskey , these figures may still look slim . ( Mark Twain thought that while too much of anything was bad , too much whiskey was barely enough . ) To others , the data may suggest that the advocates of more public spending have already had their way . Could their present discontent be the result of a not keeping their statistics up-to-date ? In one of his recent pamphlets , Arthur M. of the many neglects he observes ( including defense ) could be mended by raising public expenditures by $10 to $12 billion . That is well below the increase in public cash outlays that actually did take place in one single fiscal year , from $118.2 billion in 1958 to $132.7 billion in 1959 . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than $31 billion , though the advance slowed down in 1960 . More facts and less indignation might help to attain better perspective . Some parts of federal , state , and local budgets have expanded less rapidly than those cited ? in many cases fortunately . The massive buildup in defense expenditures from the late ' forties to the ' fifties has squeezed other programs . Unfortunately. , on the other hand , some programs that both political parties have favored ? including aid to education , to depressed areas , for urban renewal ? have been delayed unduly by the vicissitudes of politics . But the figures as a whole lend little support to the thesis that politicians do n't spend enough , and that the government store is not expanding fast enough . The Citizen in the Stores The two stores ? private and public ? work very hard these days to capture the business of the citizen-taxpayer . Here is what he hears as he walks into the private store : " The principal advantage of this store , " the private businessman says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want . If I do n't have it I 'll order it . You , the consumer , are the boss here . To be sure , I 'm not in business for charity but for profit . But my profit comes from giving you what you want . And with competition as fierce as it is , you can be sure the profit wo n't be excessive . " If the proprietor has been to Harvard Business School , he will perhaps remember to add something about the invisible hand which in a free economy causes the self-seeking of competitors to work for the common good . He will also , even with . out benefit of business school , remember to drop a word about the danger of letting the public store across the street get too big . It might As the citizen turns this sales tall over in his mind , several points occu to him . Without denying the brow validity of the argument , he wil note that quite often he has beet induced to buy things he did no really need , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zip peal and built-in obsolescence pro moted by expensive advertising don ' seem to him to fit in with the notiot that the consumer is king . Looking at the brand names and patents am trademarks , he wonders whethe most products are produced am priced competitively instead o under monopoly conditions . The in visible hand at times seems to be in visible mainly because it is so dee ' in his pocket . Bothered by these doubts , the of izen walks across the street and en tens the public store . " Let me explain to you . " says thi politician who runs it ? with the aic of a horde of hard-working bureau crats doing the chores . " The princi pies on which this store is run an known as the political procefis , ant if you happen to be familiar witl private merchandising they ma ' seem unusual , but I assure you the work . First of all , almost everything in this store is free . We simply as secs our customers a lump sum in th , form of taxes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's abil ity to pay , rather than on what h ? gets from the store . We have a shoe of hands from the customers once year , and the majority decides wha merchandise the store is to have it stock . The majority , incidentally also decides how much everybody including particularly the minority is to be assessed for taxes . " You will observe , " the politiciat continues , " that this store is not rut for profit . It is like a co-operative run for the welfare of the member I myself , to he sure , am not in poll tics for charity , but for re-election But that means that I must be it terested in your needs , or you wont ' not vote for me , Moreover , there an some useful things that only I ea ch : ) , with the help of the politica process , and in which you and ever citizen have an interest . For instance everybody ought to go to school . can make them go . Everybody ougf to have old-age insurance . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the service , I can help even up a little the inequalities of life . " By the way , " the politician concludes , " if there is any special little thing you want , I may be able to get it for you , and of course it wo n't cost you a nickel . " The citizen has some fault to find with the political process too . He notes that there is not even a theoretical claim to the benefits of an invisible hand . Majority rule may produce benefits for the majority , but how about the other 49 per cent ? Nor is there the discipline of competition , or the need for profits , to test economy of operation , There is no way , in the public store , of adjusting individual costs and benefits . And the promise to get him some small favor , while tempting . worries him , because he wonders what the politician may have promised to others . The political process , he is led to suspect , may be ? little haphazard . He asks himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously , it is not the majority that really makes a decision , but a small pressure group that is getting away with something . He will remember that ? after payments for major national security and public debt interest ? the largest single expenditure in the federal budget is for agriculture , anti the next for veterans . He may also recall that one of the first budgetary actions of the new Administration was to increase funds for agriculture by $3 billion . The Expanding Belt Next , the citizen might consider the paralyzing " balance-of-forces " effect that often blocks a desirable reshuffling of expenditures . The allocation of public funds reflects the bargaining power of their sponsors , inside or outside the government . A classical example was the division of funds that prevailed in the Defense Department during the late ' forties . Army , Navy , and Air Force were to share in total resources in a way that would maximize military potential . By some strange coincidence , maximum potential was always achieved by giving each service the same amount of money . It took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consequence of the balance-of-forces effect ? If the proponents of one kind of expenditure want to get more money for their projects , they must concede an increase also to the advocates of others . More education means more highways , instead of less ; more air power means more ground forces . To increase a budget in one direction only is as difficult as letting out one 's belt only on one side . The expansion tends to go all around . ' What this comes down to is that politicians are not very good at setting priorities . Increases in good expenditures are burdened with a political surcharge of less good ones . The last-ditch survival power of federal programs is a specially illuminating instance of the balance of forces . If a monument were built in Washington in memory of each major federal program that has been discontinued , the appearance of the city would not he greatly altered . In contrast , when the Edsel does n't sell , production stops . But the government is still reclaiming land to raise more farm surpluses and training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive . Old federal programs never die , they do n't even fade away ? they just go on . The citizen will remember also the ancient and honorable practice of logrolling . The unhappy fate of the Area Development bill illustrates it admirably . As originally proposed , the bill sought to aid a limited number of industrial areas where new jobs were badly needed . It got nowhere in the Congress . Only when it was extended to a large number of areas with less urgent or quite different problems , were enough legislators brought aboard to pass it . Because of the heavy political surcharge with which it had become loaded , President Eisenhower vetoed the bill . A bill was finally enacted early this year , long after aid should have been brought to the areas that needed it . Finally , the citizen might discover in some dark corner of his mind a nagging thought : Any particular government program may be a blessing , but could their cumulative effect be a threat to freedom ? He has heard businessmen say this so often that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather resents businessmen acting the dog in the manger , trying to stop useful things from being done unless they can do them . He is irritated when he hears a man talk about freedom who obviously is thinking about profit . And yet ? is there any conclusive re-buttal ? The Citizen 's Failures The citizen would be quite wrong , however , if he blamed the politician for the defects of the political process . The fault lies with the process , or better with the way in which the process , the politician , and the citizen interact . The citizen therefore would do well to examine some of his own reactions and attitudes . First , when he thinks about taxes , he tends to think of them as a burden instead of as a price he pays for a service . As a body , the nation 's taxpayers are like a group of neighbors who decide to establish a fire department . Because none is quite sure how much good it will do him , and because each hopes to benefit from the contribution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the end they are likely to wind up with a bucket brigade . But when it comes to accepting benefits , the citizen-taxpayers act like a group of men who sit down at a restaurant table knowing that they will split the check evenly . In this situation everybody orders generously ; it adds little to one 's own share of the bill , and for the extravagance of his friends he will have to pay anyhow . What happens at the restaurant table explains ? though it does not excuse ? what happens at the public trough . Finally , in his reaction to public or free services , the citizen takes a great deal for granted , and seldom thinks of the cost . Public beaches mistreated , unmetered parking space permanently occupied , veterans ' adjustment benefits continued without need ? as well as abuses of unemployment compensation and public assistance ? are some examples . This applies also , of course , to privately affcred benefits , under health insurance , for instance . The kindly nurse in the hospital ? " Why do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ou anything , it 's all paid for by Blue Cross " ? makes the point . By removing the link between costs and benefits , the political process also reduces the citizen 's interest in earning money . The citizen works to live . If some of his liviug comes to him without working , he would be less than rational if he did not respond with a demand for shorter hours . If these public benefits increase his tax burden so that his over-all standard of living remains unchanged . the higher taxes will reduce his work incentive . Why work hard , if much of it is for the govern-ment ? The Political Dollar at a Discount These various defects of the political process acid up to an obvious conclusion : the dollar spent by even the most honest and scrupulous of politicians is not always a full-bodied dollar . It often is subject to a discount . It buys less than it should because of the attrition it suffers as it goes through the process , and its may be worth only 90 cents or 80 cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many cases , may also be worth less than 100 per cent . But here each man can form his own judgment , can pick and choose or refuse altogether . In the political process , all he can do is say Yes or No once a year in November . The discount on the public dollar may be compensated by the other advantages of government ? its ability to compel , to subsidize , to do things on a big scale and at a low interest cost . - Whether that is the case needs to be studied in each instance . Where these advantages do not apply , the private market will give better servile than the political process . For many services , there is at least some leeway for choice between the private and public store -- health and retirement , housing , research , higher education , natural-resource development . Defense , on the other hand , as well as public administration , public works of all kinds , and the great bulk of education ? while perhaps made rather expensive by the political process ? leave no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered is no plea to spend more or less on any particular function . It is a plea for doing whatever we do in the most effective way .
