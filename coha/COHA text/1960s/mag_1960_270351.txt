( See Cover ) <P> Along the steaming , mud-covered delta of Africa 's Niger River , bare-chested men labored amid crocodiles and screaming parrots this week to push shafts of steel deep into the earth . On the choppy waters of the Persian Gulf , others perched on a crablike platform and sent a snag-toothed bit boring into the ocean bed . Around the world , hundreds of men labored just as sweatily in 35 other countries - from the pampas of Argentina to the back hills of New Zealand - to probe the earth in an eager quest for the substance that makes the world 's wheels go round : oil . <P> The men on the Niger , the men in New Zealand 's back hills are all employees of a single company , Royal Dutch/Shell , the world 's second biggest oil company - after Standard Oil ( New Jersey ) - and by far the most international in scope , organization and spirit .

Oil is not only powering the unprecedented industrial growth of the West ; it is also putting many an underdeveloped country on wheels for the first time .

Once abundant in comparatively few areas of the world ( e.g. , the Middle East , Venezuela , Texas ) , oil has been discovered in so many places ( e.g. , Libya , the Sahara , Europe ) that there are few the geologist will flatly mark " no . " The Group , after 22 years of searching , has even turned up oil right in its own backyard - two miles from its offices in The Hague , and virtually in the garden of one of its directors . <P> The scramble for new oil has attracted a swarm of scrappy independent wildcatters - to the great concern of the industry 's giants . The independents are drilling all over the world , cutting prices , moving into long-established markets - thanks to a tanker surplus that provides them with dirt-cheap transport .
