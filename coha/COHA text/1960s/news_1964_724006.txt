Mr. Salinger 's victory was a hard blow to Gov . Edmund G. Brown and other party notables backing Mr , Cranston against a pro-Salinger faction led by State Assembly Speaker Jesse M. Unruh , the party " strong man , " who was a Kennedy Ad- , ministration liaison man in , California . Starting late in a " battle of endorsements " with the 49-yearold Cranston , Mr. Salinger won testimonials from Mrs. John F. Kennedy , Mrs. Peter Lawford , the President 's sister , and Mrs. Lucretia Engle , the incumbent 's wife . Governor Brown 's prestige also was on the line to a degree in another contest : a choice between his 160-member national convention delegation pledged to President Johnson , and a rival slate , also pledged to the President , mounted by Los Angeles Mayor Samuel Yorty primarily to rack up an anti-Brown protest vote , The Democratic nominee will have a built-in edge in the November contest of some 4 million registered partisans compared with only about 3 million Republicans .

The Senatorial contest developed late last year after Senator Engle 's first operation in August raised doubts about his ability to run , despite his protestations that he could . Up to then he had been considered virtually certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to oppose him . In January , continued uncertainty about his condition impelled Democratic organization leaders to declare the primary contest open to all comers . In February , the party 's massmembership organization , the California Democratic Council , regretfully demurred at hacking Senator Engle and endorsed Controller Cranston . Governor Brown and an array of other party notables aligned with Mr. Cranston , in the name of party harmony , put pressure on Attorney General Stanley Mosk to drop out of the race . But on March 19 , on the basis of legal advice from Mr. Mosk , Mr. Salinger unexpectedly resigned his White House job and flew to California to file Senatorial nomination papers right on the deadline . More than a week of intensive legal challenges ensued before the State Supreme Court held , inferentially , that Mr. Salinger , as a registered Democrat , was eligible to compete in the primary and that he met the Fedleral Senatorial qualifications of nine years ' United States eitilzenship , 32 years minimum age , and residence in the state at election time .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
