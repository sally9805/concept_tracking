A gun is an interesting weapon ; it can be hired , of course , and naturally does n't care who hires it . Something much the same can be said of the gunman , too .... GUN FOR HIRE By MACK REYNOLDS Illustrated by van Dongen Joe Prantera called softly , " Al . " The pleasurable , comfortable , warm feeling began spreading over him , the way it always did . The older man stopped and squinted , but not suspiciously , even now . The evening was dark , it was unlikely that the other even saw the circle of steel that was the mouth of the shotgun barrel , now resting on the car 's window ledge . " Who 's it ? " he growled . Joe Prantera said softly , " Big Louis sent me , Al . " And he pressed the trigger . And at that moment , the universe caved inward upon Joseph Marie Prantera . There was nausea and nausea upon nausea . There was a falling through all space and through all time . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was pain , horror and tumultuous fear . And he came out of it as quickly and completely as he 'd gone in . He was in , he thought , a hospital and his first reaction was to think , This here California . Everything different . Then his second thought was Something went wrong . Big Louis , he ai n't going to like this . Illustration He brought his thinking to the present . So far as he could remember , he had n't completely pulled the trigger . That at least meant that whatever the rap was it would n't be too tough . With luck , the syndicate would get him off with a couple of years at Quentin . A door slid open in the wall in a way that Joe had never seen a door operate before . This here California . The clothes on the newcomer were wrong , too . For the first time , Joe Prantera began to sense an alienness  --  a something that was awfully wrong . The other spoke precisely and slowly , the way a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writes fluently but has little occasion to practice vocally . " You have recovered ? " Joe Prantera looked at the other expressionlessly . Maybe the old duck was one of these foreign doctors , like . The newcomer said , " You have undoubtedly been through a most harrowing experience . If you have any untoward symptoms , possibly I could be of assistance . " Joe could n't figure out how he stood . For one thing , there should have been some kind of police guard . The other said , " Perhaps a bit of stimulant ? " Joe said flatly , " I wanta lawyer . " The newcomer frowned at him . " A lawyer ? " " I 'm not sayin ' nothin ' . Not until I get a mouthpiece . " The newcomer started off on another tack . " My name is Lawrence Reston-Farrell . If I am not mistaken , you are Joseph Salviati-Prantera . " Salviati happened to be Joe 's mother 's maiden name . But it was unlikely this character could have known that . Joe had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childbirth . His father had n't brought him to the States until the age of five and by that time he had a stepmother . " I wanta mouthpiece , " Joe said flatly , " or let me outta here . " Lawrence Reston-Farrell said , " You are not being constrained . There are clothes for you in the closet there . " Joe gingerly tried swinging his feet to the floor and sitting up , while the other stood watching him , strangely . He came to his feet . With the exception of a faint nausea , which brought back memories of that extreme condition he 'd suffered during ... during what ? He had n't the vaguest idea of what had happened . He was dressed in a hospital-type nightgown . He looked down at it and snorted and made his way over to the closet . It opened on his approach , the door sliding back into the wall in much the same manner as the room 's door had opened for Reston-Farrell . Joe Prantera scowled and said , " These ai n't my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You think I 'd be seen dead wearing this stuff ? What is this , some religious crackpot hospital ? " Reston-Farrell said , " I am afraid , Mr. Salviati-Prantera , that these are the only garments available . I suggest you look out the window there . " Joe gave him a long , chill look and then stepped to the window . He could n't figure the other . Unless he was a fruitcake . Maybe he was in some kind of pressure cooker and this was one of the fruitcakes . He looked out , however , not on the lawns and walks of a sanitarium but upon a wide boulevard of what was obviously a populous city . And for a moment again , Joe Prantera felt the depths of nausea . This was not his world . He stared for a long , long moment . The cars did n't even have wheels , he noted dully . He turned slowly and faced the older man . Reston-Farrell said compassionately , " Try this , it 's excellent cognac . " Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's it all about ? " The other put down the unaccepted glass . " We were afraid first realization would be a shock to you , " he said . " My colleague is in the adjoining room . We will be glad to explain to you if you will join us there . " " I wanta get out of here , " Joe said . " Where would you go ? " The fear of police , of Al Rossi 's vengeance , of the measures that might be taken by Big Louis on his failure , were now far away . Reston-Farrell had approached the door by which he had entered and it reopened for him . He went through it without looking back . There was nothing else to do . Joe dressed , then followed him . * * * * * In the adjoining room was a circular table that would have accommodated a dozen persons . Two were seated there now , papers , books and soiled coffee cups before them . There had evidently been a long wait . Reston-Farrell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drawn of face and with a chainsmoker 's nervousness . The other was heavier and more at ease . They were both , Joe estimated , somewhere in their middle fifties . They both looked like docs . He wondered , all over again , if this was some kind of pressure cooker . But that did n't explain the view from the window . Reston-Farrell said , " May I present my colleague , Citizen Warren Brett-James ? Warren , this is our guest from ... from yesteryear , Mr. Joseph Salviati-Prantera . " Brett-James nodded to him , friendly , so far as Joe could see . He said gently , " I think it would be Mr. Joseph Prantera , would n't it ? The maternal linage was almost universally ignored . " His voice too gave the impression he was speaking a language not usually on his tongue . Joe took an empty chair , hardly bothering to note its alien qualities . His body seemed to fit into the piece of furniture , as though it had been molded to his order . Joe said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink , Doc . " Reston-Farrell said , " Of course , " and then something else Joe did n't get . Whatever the something else was , a slot opened in the middle of the table and a glass , so clear of texture as to be all but invisible , was elevated . It contained possibly three ounces of golden fluid . Joe did n't allow himself to think of its means of delivery . He took up the drink and bolted it . He put the glass down and said carefully , " What 's it all about , huh ? " Warren Brett-James said soothingly , " Prepare yourself for somewhat of a shock , Mr. Prantera . You are no longer in Los Angeles  --  " " Ya think I 'm stupid ? I can see that . " " I was about to say , Los Angeles of 1960 . Mr. Prantera , we welcome you to Nuevo Los Angeles . " " Ta where ? " " To Nuevo Los Angeles and to the year  --  " Brett-James looked at his companion . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2133 , " Reston-Farrell said . " 2133 A.D. they would say . " Joe Prantera looked from one of them to the other , scowling . " What are you guys talking about ? " Warren Brett-James said softly , " Mr. Prantera , you are no longer in the year 1960 , you are now in the year 2133 . " He said , uncomprehendingly , " You mean I been , like , unconscious for  --  " He let the sentence fall away as he realized the impossibility . Brett-James said gently , " Hardly for one hundred and seventy years , Mr. Prantera . " Reston-Farrell said , " I am afraid we are confusing you . Briefly , we have transported you , I suppose one might say , from your own era to ours . " Joe Prantera had never been exposed to the concept of time travel . He had simply never associated with anyone who had ever even remotely considered such an idea . Now he said , " You mean , like , I been asleep all that time ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Suffice to say , you are now one hundred and seventy-three years after the last memory you have . " Joe Prantera 's mind suddenly reverted to those last memories and his eyes narrowed dangerously . He felt suddenly at bay . He said , " Maybe you guys better let me in on what 's this all about . " Reston-Farrell said , " Mr. Prantera , we have brought you from your era to perform a task for us . " Joe stared at him , and then at the other . He could n't believe he was getting through to them . Or , at least , that they were to him . Finally he said , " If I get this , you want me to do a job for you . " " That is correct . " Joe said , " You guys know the kind of jobs I do ? " " That is correct . " " Like hell you do . You think I 'm stupid ? I never even seen you before . " Joe Prantera came abruptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " For the second time , Reston-Farrell said , " Where would you go , Mr. Prantera ? " Joe glared at him . Then sat down again , as abruptly as he 'd arisen . * * * * * " Let 's start all over again . I got this straight , you brought me , some screwy way , all the way ... here . O.K. , I 'll buy that . I seen what it looks like out that window  --  " The real comprehension was seeping through to him even as he talked . " Everybody I know , Jessie , Tony , the Kid , Big Louis , everybody , they 're dead . Even Big Louis . " " Yes , " Brett-James said , his voice soft . " They are all dead , Mr. Prantera . Their children are all dead , and their grandchildren . " The two men of the future said nothing more for long minutes while Joe Prantera 's mind whirled its confusion . Finally he said , " What 's this bit about you wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is why we brought you here , Mr. Prantera . You were ... you are , a professional assassin . " " Hey , wait a minute , now . " Reston-Farrell went on , ignoring the interruption . " There is small point in denying your calling . Pray remember that at the point when we ... transported you , you were about to dispose of a contemporary named Alphonso Annunziata-Rossi . A citizen , I might say , whose demise would probably have caused small dismay to society . " They had him pegged all right . Joe said , " But why me ? Why do n't you get some heavy from now ? Somebody knows the ropes these days . " Brett-James said , " Mr. Prantera , there are no professional assassins in this age , nor have there been for over a century and a half . " " Well , then do it yourself . " Joe Prantera 's irritation over this whole complicated mess was growing . And already he was beginning to long for the things he knew  --  for Jessie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the lasagne down at Papa Giovanni 's . Right now he could have welcomed a calling down at the hands of Big Louis . Reston-Farrell had come to his feet and walked to one of the large room 's windows . He looked out , as though unseeing . Then , his back turned , he said , " We have tried , but it is simply not in us , Mr. Prantera . " " You mean you 're yella ? " " No , if by that you mean afraid . It is simply not within us to take the life of a fellow creature  --  not to speak of a fellow man . " Joe snapped : " Everything you guys say sounds crazy . Let 's start all over again . " Brett-James said , " Let me do it , Lawrence . " He turned his eyes to Joe . " Mr. Prantera , in your own era , did you ever consider the future ? " Joe looked at him blankly . " In your day you were confronted with national and international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as nations were a century or a millennium ago . " " Sure , O.K. , so we had problems . I know whatcha mean  --  like wars , and depressions and dictators and like that . " " Yes , like that , " Brett-James nodded . The heavy-set man paused a moment . " Yes , like that , " he repeated . " That we confront you now indicates that the problems of your day were solved . Had n't they been , the world most surely would have destroyed itself . Wars ? Our pedagogues are hard put to convince their students that such ever existed . More than a century and a half ago our society eliminated the reasons for international conflict . For that matter , " he added musingly , " we eliminated most international boundaries . Depressions ? Shortly after your own period , man awoke to the fact that he had achieved to the point where it was possible to produce an abundance for all with a minimum of toil . Overnight , for all practical purposes , the whole world was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by revolutionary changes in almost every field , certainly in every science . Dictators ? Your ancestors found , Mr. Prantera , that it is difficult for a man to be free so long as others are still enslaved . Today the democratic ethic has reached a pinnacle never dreamed of in your own era . " " O.K. , O.K. , " Joe Prantera growled . " So everybody 's got it made . What I wanta know is what 's all this about me giving it ta somebody ? If everything 's so great , how come you want me to knock this guy off ? " Reston-Farrell bent forward and thumped his right index finger twice on the table . " The bacterium of hate  --  a new strain  --  has found the human race unprotected from its disease . We had thought our vaccines immunized us . " " What 's that suppose to mean ? " Brett-James took up the ball again . " Mr. Prantera , have you ever heard of Ghengis Khan , of Tamerlane , Alexander , Caesar ? " Joe Prantera scowled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Napoleon , Hitler , Stalin ? " " Sure I heard of Hitler and Stalin , " Joe growled . " I ai n't stupid . " The other nodded . " Such men are unique . They have a drive ... a drive to power which exceeds by far the ambitions of the average man . They are genii in their way , Mr. Prantera , genii of evil . Such a genius of evil has appeared on the current scene . " " Now we 're getting somewheres , " Joe snorted . " So you got a guy what 's a little ambitious , like , eh ? And you guys ai n't got the guts to give it to him . O.K. What 's in it for me ? " The two of them frowned , exchanged glances . Reston-Farrell said , " You know , that is one aspect we had not considered . " Brett-James said to Joe Prantera , " Had we not , ah , taken you at the time we did , do you realize what would have happened ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let old Al Rossi have it right in the guts , five times . Then I woulda took the plane back to Chi . " Brett-James was shaking his head . " No . You see , by coincidence , a police squad car was coming down the street just at that moment to arrest Mr. Rossi . You would have been apprehended . As I understand Californian law of the period , your life would have been forfeit , Mr. Prantera . " Joe winced . It did n't occur to him to doubt their word . Reston-Farrell said , " As to reward , Mr. Prantera , we have already told you there is ultra-abundance in this age . Once this task has been performed , we will sponsor your entry into present day society . Competent psychiatric therapy will soon remove your present  --  " " Waita minute , now . You figure on gettin ' me candled by some head shrinker , eh ? No thanks , Buster . I 'm going back to my own  --  " Brett-James was shaking his head again . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time travel works but in one direction , with the flow of the time stream . There can be no return to your own era . " Joe Prantera had been rocking with the mental blows he had been assimilating , but this was the final haymaker . He was stuck in this squaresville of a world . * * * * * Joe Prantera on a job was thorough . Careful , painstaking , competent . He spent the first three days of his life in the year 2133 getting the feel of things . Brett-James and Reston-Farrell had been appointed to work with him . Joe did n't meet any of the others who belonged to the group which had taken the measures to bring him from the past . He did n't want to meet them . The fewer persons involved , the better . He stayed in the apartment of Reston-Farrell . Joe had been right , Reston-Farrell was a medical doctor . Brett-James evidently had something to do with the process that had enabled them to bring Joe from the past . Joe did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care . Joe was a realist . He was here . The thing was to adapt . There did n't seem to be any hurry . Once the deal was made , they left it up to him to make the decisions . They drove him around the town , when he wished to check the traffic arteries . They flew him about the whole vicinity . From the air , Southern California looked much the same as it had in his own time . Oceans , mountains , and to a lesser extent , deserts , are fairly permanent even against man 's corroding efforts . It was while he was flying with Brett-James on the second day that Joe said , " How about Mexico ? Could I make the get to Mexico ? " The physicist looked at him questioningly . " Get ? " he said . Joe Prantera said impatiently , " The getaway . After I give it to this Howard Temple-Tracy guy , I got ta go on the run , do n't I ? " " I see . " Brett-James cleared his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Prantera . All North America has been united into one unit . Today , there are only eight nations in the world . " " Where 's the nearest ? " " South America . " " That 's a helluva long way to go on a get . " " We had n't thought of the matter being handled in that manner . " Joe eyed him in scorn . " Oh , you did n't , huh ? What happens after I give it to this guy ? I just sit around and wait for the cops to put the arm on me ? " Brett-James grimaced in amusement . " Mr. Prantera , this will probably be difficult for you to comprehend , but there are no police in this era . " Joe gaped at him . " No police ! What happens if you got ta throw some guy in stir ? " " If I understand your idiom correctly , you mean prison . There are no prisons in this era , Mr. Prantera . " Joe stared . " No cops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from just going into some bank , like , and collecting up all the bread ? " Brett-James cleared his throat . " Mr. Prantera , there are no banks . " " No banks ! You got ta have banks ! " " And no money to put in them . We found it a rather antiquated method of distribution well over a century ago . " Joe had given up . Now he merely stared . Brett-James said reasonably , " We found we were devoting as much time to financial matters in all their endless ramifications  --  including bank robberies  --  as we were to productive efforts . So we turned to more efficient methods of distribution . " * * * * * On the fourth day , Joe said , " O.K. , let 's get down to facts . Summa the things you guys say do n't stick together so good . Now , first place , where 's this guy Temple-Tracy you want knocked off ? " Reston-Farrell and Brett-James were both present . The three of them sat in the living room of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be the prevailing beverage of the day . For Joe 's taste it was insipid stuff . Happily , rye was available to those who wanted it . Reston-Farrell said , " You mean , where does he reside ? Why , here in this city . " " Well , that 's handy , eh ? " Joe scratched himself thoughtfully . " You got somebody can finger him for me ? " " Finger him ? " " Look , before I can give it to this guy I got ta know some place where he 'll be at some time . Get it ? Like Al Rossi . My finger , he works in Rossi 's house , see ? He lets me know every Wednesday night , eight o'clock , Al leaves the house all by hisself . O.K. , so I can make plans , like , to give it to him . " Joe Prantera wound it up reasonably . " You got ta have a finger . " Brett-James said , " Why not just go to Temple-Tracy 's apartment and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , eh ? You think I 'm stupid ? How do I know how many witnesses hangin ' around ? How do I know if the guy 's carryin ' heat ? " " Heat ? " " A gun , a gun . Ya think I 'm stupid ? I come to give it to him and he gives it to me instead . " Dr. Reston-Farrell said , " Howard Temple-Tracy lives alone . He customarily receives visitors every afternoon , largely potential followers . He is attempting to recruit members to an organization he is forming . It would be quite simple for you to enter his establishment and dispose of him . I assure you , he does not possess weapons . " Joe was indignant . " Just like that , eh ? " he said sarcastically . " Then what happens ? How do I get out of the building ? Where 's my get car parked ? Where do I hide out ? Where do I dump the heat ? " " Dump the heat ? " " Get rid of the gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on me ? I 'd wind up in the gas chamber so quick  --  " " See here , Mr. Prantera , " Brett-James said softly . " We no longer have capital punishment , you must realize . " " O.K. I still do n't wanta get caught . What is the rap these days , huh ? " Joe scowled . " You said they did n't have no jails any more . " " This is difficult for you to understand , I imagine , " Reston-Farrell told him , " but , you see , we no longer punish people in this era . " That took a long , unbelieving moment to sink in . " You mean , like , no matter what they do ? That 's crazy . Everybody 'd be running around giving it to everybody else . " " The motivation for crime has been removed , Mr. Prantera , " Reston-Farrell attempted to explain . " A person who commits a violence against another is obviously in need of medical care . And , consequently , receives it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car or something , they just take me to a doctor ? " Joe Prantera was unbelieving . " Why would anybody wish to steal a car ? " Reston-Farrell said easily . " But if I give it to somebody ? " " You will be turned over to a medical institution . Citizen Howard Temple-Tracy is the last man you will ever kill , Mr. Prantera . " A chillness was in the belly of Joe Prantera . He said very slowly , very dangerously , " You guys figure on me getting caught , do n't you ? " " Yes , " Brett-James said evenly . " Well then , figure something else . You think I 'm stupid ? " " Mr. Prantera , " Dr. Reston-Farrell said , " there has been as much progress in the field of psychiatry in the past two centuries as there has in any other . Your treatment would be brief and painless , believe me . " Joe said coldly , " And what happens to you guys ? How do you know I wo n't rat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after you have accomplished your mission , we plan to turn ourselves over to the nearest institution to have determined whether or not we also need therapy . " " Now I 'm beginning to wonder about you guys , " Joe said . " Look , all over again , what'd'ya wanta give it to this guy for ? " The doctor said , " We explained the other day , Mr. Prantera . Citizen Howard Temple-Tracy is a dangerous , atavistic , evil genius . We are afraid for our institutions if his plans are allowed to mature . " " Well if you got things so good , everybody 's got it made , like , who 'd listen to him ? " The doctor nodded at the validity of the question . " Mr. Prantera , Homo sapiens is a unique animal . Physically he matures at approximately the age of thirteen . However , mental maturity and adjustment is often not fully realized until thirty or even more . Indeed , it is sometimes never achieved . Before such maturity is reached , our youth are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the supposed glory of the military , all seem romantic to the immature . They rebel at the orderliness of present society . They seek entertainment in excitement . Citizen Temple-Tracy is aware of this and finds his recruits among the young . " " O.K. , so this guy is dangerous . You want him knocked off before he screws everything up . But the way things are , there 's no way of making a get . So you 'll have to get some other patsy . Not me . " " I am afraid you have no alternative , " Brett-James said gently . " Without us , what will you do ? Mr. Prantera , you do not even speak the language . " " What'd'ya mean ? I do n't understand summa the big words you eggheads use , but I get by O.K. " Brett-James said , " Amer-English is no longer the language spoken by the man in the street , Mr. Prantera . Only students of such subjects any longer speak such tongues as Amer-English , French , Russian or the many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a means of communication . " " You mean there 's no place in the whole world where they talk American ? " Joe demanded , aghast . * * * * * Dr. Reston-Farrell controlled the car . Joe Prantera sat in the seat next to him and Warren Brett-James sat in the back . Joe had , tucked in his belt , a .45 caliber automatic , once displayed in a museum . It had been more easily procured than the ammunition to fit it , but that problem too had been solved . The others were nervous , obviously repelled by the very conception of what they had planned . Inwardly , Joe was amused . Now that they had got in the clutch , the others were on the verge of chickening out . He knew it would n't have taken much for them to cancel the project . It was n't any answer though . If they allowed him to call it off today , they 'd talk themselves into it again before the week was through . Besides , already Joe was beginning to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on occasions like this . He said , " You 're sure this guy talks American , eh ? " Warren Brett-James said , " Quite sure . He is a student of history . " " And he wo n't think it 's funny I talk American to him , eh ? " " He 'll undoubtedly be intrigued . " They pulled up before a large apartment building that overlooked the area once known as Wilmington . Joe was coolly efficient now . He pulled out the automatic , held it down below his knees and threw a shell into the barrel . He eased the hammer down , thumbed on the safety , stuck the weapon back in his belt and beneath the jacketlike garment he wore . He said , " O.K. See you guys later . " He left them and entered the building . An elevator  --  he still was n't used to their speed in this era  --  whooshed him to the penthouse duplex occupied by Citizen Howard Temple-Tracy . There were two persons in the reception room but they left on Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than glancingly . He spotted the screen immediately and went over and stood before it . The screen lit and revealed a heavy-set , dour of countenance man seated at a desk . He looked into Joe Prantera 's face , scowled and said something . Joe said , " Joseph Salviati-Prantera to interview Citizen Howard Temple-Tracy . " The other 's shaggy eyebrows rose . " Indeed , " he said . " In Amer-English ? " Joe nodded . " Enter , " the other said . A door had slid open on the other side of the room . Joe walked through it and into what was obviously an office . Citizen Temple-Tracy sat at a desk . There was only one other chair in the room . Joe Prantera ignored it and remained standing . Citizen Temple-Tracy said , " What can I do for you ? " Joe looked at him for a long , long moment . Then he reached down to his belt and brought forth the .45 automatic . He moistened his lips . Joe said softly , " You know what this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's a handgun , circa , I would say , about 1925 Old Calendar . What in the world are you doing with it ? " Joe said , very slowly , " Chief , in the line you 're in these days you needa heavy around with wunna these . Otherwise , Chief , you 're gunna wind up in some gutter with a lotta holes in you . What I 'm doin ' , I 'm askin ' for a job . You need a good man knows how to handle wunna these , Chief . " Citizen Howard Temple-Tracy eyed him appraisingly . " Perhaps , " he said , " you are right at that . In the near future , I may well need an assistant knowledgeable in the field of violence . Tell me more about yourself . You surprise me considerably . " " Sure , Chief . It 's kinda a long story , though . First off , I better tell you you got some bad enemies , Chief . Two guys special , named Brett-James and Doc Reston-Farrell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hafta do for you , Chief , is to give it to those two . " THE END
