txt Letters to the Editor pg . 346 Letters to the Editor Language TO THE EinToR : I WONDER if the Book Review realizes that it has just published one of the truly great masterpieces of fine writing . This is Mr. Eric Partridge 's " Degraded Language " in the Sept. 18 edition . ? Fine writing " ? as you of course know ? is what they used to teach at young ladies ' nol.shing schools at the turn of the century . It is writing for writing's-sake ; writing in a convoluted cascade of recherch ? words in order to create an " effect " on ( and envy in the heart of ) the beholder ; it is to pour forth sonorous syllables in complex , intricate and majestic sentences ( like this one ) . It is to create a thing of beauty for the admiration of oneself and the astonishment and frustration of the others . . . . FRANCIS A. E. SPITZER . New York City . To THE EDITOR : The article entitled " Degraded Language , " by Eric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edits or teaches language . His challenge to slovenly speech and writing is one of the few I have read in an era dominated by the permissive school which would allow a language to deteriorate for the convenience of those who will not or can not learn to speak and write it . Applied to all the amenities , this principle , or lack of it , would have us slopping at the trough of mediocrity , and , as Mr. Partridge suggests , finding a common level in the dregs of the swill . . . . IL T. ROWE . Ridgewood , N. J. TO THE EDITOR : ' T is pity that Eric Partridge is annoyed , but ' t is shameful that in expressing an attitude compounded perhaps of equal parts of dismay , anger and hostility toward some excesses of modem linguistic thought , he preaches , pontificates ? and makes manifest his own language class snobbery . One infers that Mr. Partridge , while hurling maledictions at pedants , has turned into one himself . What is most unfortunate about this type of article is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language , many of whom share Partridge 's apparent love for language that delights the intellect and excites the imagination . We all aim at precision and clarity of thought , but language is not as precise as many writers would have us believe and most certainly does not exist merely for those who wish it to be an instrument for " . . . exhilaration and enchantment , sweet reasonableness , beauty . . . " Shades of Pope , Swift and bawdy Will Shakespeare ! We also use language to curse our enemies , engage in commerce and maintain property rights ( and civil rights ) . We change our world through language , manipulate reality with it , and leap up toward our ideals . If we crash ingloriously to the ground , it is often because ( among other factors ) our world is a harsh one . Mr. Partridge seems to desire a world where men soulfully look at one another and say " Adieu " upon parting rather than " So long , Buddy . " Language can give us entry into a world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where one can not merely get drunk on words and ideas with kindred spirits , but also send rockets to the moon and blast mountains aside . Mr. Partridge says that the rules of grammar were not " evolved as an instrument of torture , nor yet to clog the advance of learning and thinking , much less to make things difficult for the dull . " Still , year after year , students get so confused with learning the nomenclature and definitions of grammar that they often feel like butterflies caught in a sandblast . The assertion that ritual teaching of grammar teaches one to write  --  and to write well ? is a religious assertion not backed up by linguistic investigation . This is not to say " Do not teach grammar . " Rather teach it as part of an organic study and criticism of language . ? ? ? RICHARD SAFRAN . Brooklyn , N. Y. To THE EDITOR : Why are the custodians of language purity so careful to keep their standards secret , their strictures subjective ? Why do they imagine they can impose their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety of speech , struggling though individuals to make language adequate to thought and feeling ? Is it because they sense their own superfluity , and can not bear to have it exposed , and so must resort to authority and affirm their superiority ? Or is it because they lack the generosity of spirit to recognize that many men and women , some of them illiterate , know better than they do how to use language effectively and artistically , and these must be scorned lest they expose the emptiness or puristic pronouncements ? KARL V. TEETER . Cambridge , Mass . Mr. Partridge replies : To anyone knowing my work , Mr. Teeter 's letter must have been hilariously fumy and gloriously irrelevant . To apply such terms as " armchairs , " " secret standards , " " pedantic principles , " to one who went out to earn his living at 16 , who has served nine years in the Armed Forces ( only one as an officer ) in wartime , who has either written about or recorded slang and ( Continued on Pace 62 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cliche and vogue and " officialese " in a number of books extending well over 30 years , and who is hardly a conventionalist , will strike many as perhaps a little wide of the mark . And why has Mr. Teeter written his entertaining attack in the very English he pretends to scorn , not in the language he implies he admires ? Hudson Valley To THE EDITOR : ANY author , I suppose , welcomes a review of his work in The Times and I am no exception even though your reviewer ? in this case a good journalist , Warren Weaver ? took me to task for an alleged outlook which my book , " Rockefeller 's Follies , " does not in my judgment reflect . More to the point , however , is a serious error of fact in the final paragraph of Mr. Weaver 's review . Here is the paragraph : " A former newspaper reporter and public relations consultant , Rodgers reports that Representative Richard L. Ottinger , a Westchester Democrat , first interested him in writing about the ' Hudson Valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his research until the focus of the book shifted . Certainly Ottinger and other Democrats will not be displeased with the result " Mr. Ottinger did no such thing . Either Mr. Weaver was misinformed or he somehow misconstrued what I said to him in a telephone conversation . It was I who , among others , nourished Mr. Ottinger 's interest in the plight of the Hudson Valley and in related conservation issues . My intense interest in this subject dates back 20 years and Dick Ottinger sensed the political value of the issues about two years ago . I have a good regard for Congressman ( ) Binger , but only my publisher ( Stein &; Day ) and I had anything to do with the decision-making involving " Rockefeller 's Follies . " .. . WILLIAM RODGERS . Briarcliff Manor , N. Y. S. Y. Agnon To THE EDITOR : I ENJOYED reading James Feron 's interview with Hebrew writer S. Y. Agnon ( Sept. 18 ) and was particularly impressed with the way in which Feron captured the rhythm of his speech so exactly . It really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . New York City . Mr. Feron comments : Agnon is a marvelous old man . I used a tape recorder for the first time ever and although it took six hours to translate his archaic Hebrew , it was worth it . Later he asked Moshe Brilliant , The Times stringer in Jerusalem who did the translation , how ft was that I never took any notes . He thought the tape recorder was a camera . When a friend took the interview over to show to him , he exclaimed : " Yes , that 's exactly what I told him . And he never took any notes . " Makes a man feel sort of sneaky . Firearms TO TILE EDITOR : VOUR anonymous reviewer 's y flailing attack on my book , " The Right to Bear Arms , " ( Aug. 21 ) exhibits the same " slap-dash reasoning " for which he criticizes me ? unjustifiably , in my opinion . For example , he regards as a " dubious proposition " the contentions in the book that the easy availability of firearms in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and indeed , accounts for violent criminals . " Yet your reviewer does not have the honesty to say that these contentions as quoted in the book represent the opinions of such distinguished authorities as J. Edgar Hoover and former Federal Bureau of Prisons Director James V. Bennett However , call this , if you will , a mere difference of opinion . But when your reviewer chooses to allude to " errors " in the book , it would seem incumbent upon him at least to cite some instances . In not doing so . he takes a position embarrassingly close to that of the National Rifle cite any . He also reveals a similar bias in referring , with obvious disparagement , to my attack on the National Rifle Association . However , like the N.R.A. , he does not choose to rebut my carefully documented attack ... CARL BAKAL . New York City . Black Power To TILE EDITOR : FOR the record , the slogan " Black Power " was not initiated or coined in June , 1966 ( Robert Bone 's otherwise fine review of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July , 1962 , in the installment that appeared that month in Ebony of Lerone Bennett Jr . ' s " Before the Mayflower . " The expression was used in the chapter title " Black Power in Dixie , " dealing with the First Reconstruction , and persuasively making the point that the trouble in 1868-76 was not too much Black Power , but too little . I can not document a link between Mr. Bennett 's initiation of the phrase and its adoption by the young activists of today , but it is just and proper to suppose that Mr. Bennett deserves the credit HOwARD N. MEYER . Rockville Centre , N.Y .
