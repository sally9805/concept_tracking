 | The Boy Who Lost His Arm and Got It Back OUTSIDE the walls of Boston 's famed Massachusetts General Hospital last May 23 , the day was calm and mild . Inside , it was anything but . By two in the afternoon the emergency ward was booking a dozen patients an hour . Many were serious cases . There was a pneumonia victim and there were  | heart attacks . There was an aneurysm ? a dangerously dilated artery . Everett Knowles III , a 12-year-old boy , came in at 2:40 . His case was more than just serious . It was to make medical history . Less than an hour later the boy lay on an operating table while a dozen specialists , nurses , and attendants prepared for extraordinary surgery . The boy 's arm had been cut off ? completely ? just below the shoulder joint . They were going to sew it back on . This was an unprecedented operation . Why did the doctors decide to try it ? How did they go about it ? What prospects are there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers are dramatic . The story of this historic operation is one of courage , skill , teamwork ? and luck . There are no villains . There are many heroes . Each forged a link in as miraculous a chain of events as has ever shaped a man 's ? or a boy 's ? fate . The story begins in Somerville , a drab industrial suburb of Boston . Somerville is a hilly place , crowded with the shops and factories where many of her 95,000 inhabitants work . Its side streets intersect major routes into downtown Boston . Its steep hills are sliced by the freight lines of the Boston and Maine Railroad . When school lets out at two , many Somerville kids make for the tracks on their way home . They run down the grassy slopes and jump down the six-foot embankment . The more daring dash across the tracks when they see a train coming and grab rides on passing boxcars . The police shoo the kids away . They come back . Everett Knowles was no exception . A bright , freckle-faced Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . What he did n't know was that the overpass abutments hug the tracks tightly . A rider who hopped the outside of . a freight would be wiped off as the train went under a bridge . This is what happened . But exactly how Everett 's arm was cut off no one knows . From the " avulsed " ( torn ) look , doctors think the arm was sheared off by the abutment . Had it been run over by one of the train 's wheels it would probably have been crushed beyond repair . Everett 's own memory washed blank . He recalls only picking himself up and starting @# to climb the slope . Moments later , he came out on Medford Street , at the foot of a hill . The time was close to 2:30 . AT THE top of the Medford Street hill is the Handy Card and Paper Company . Norman Woodside , the 42-year-old curly-haired , pipe-smoking foreman of the plant , picks up the story from there : " It was a funny thing , but we had run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us from the press room were helping the shipping boys load a truck . That 's why the doors were open . " The kid came walkin ' up the street . I heard him sobbin ' ? not cryin ' out or anything ? so I asked him what happened . He said a car hit him . I guess he was afraid to say he 'd been hoppin ' freights . . " He had his hand turned upside down , so I figured he had a broken arm . He was wearing a sports jacket and a long-sleeved shirt ? regular school clothes ? and he was pretty dusty . I asked him where he was goin ' and he said home . ' So I called to one of the fellas to grab him . " " I ran down to the office to call the ambulance , " Woodside went on . " I passed  | Alice on the way and told her there was a boy upstairs with a badly broken arm . " " Alice " is Mrs. Alice Chmielewski , a clerk in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . alert-looking woman who has always been squeamish about the sight of blood . ( Some of the press-room boys tease her by dipping their hands in red ink . ) The first thing she thought was that the boy was her own son . She an up . Everett was lying on the loading platform . " You could n't recognize the color of his shirt , " Mrs. Chmielewski said , " it was so covered with blood . His stomach , too , where he 'd been holding his arm with his left hand . That hand was all crushed and bloody . " Mrs. Chmielewski grabbed what clean rags she could find , knelt down by the boy . and put his head in her lap . She turned his head away from the strangely twisted arm so he could n't see it . When he asked about it , she said it was all right . First she thought she would apply a tourniquet . Then she found the gap within the sleeve . She was horrified . The boy 's arm was n't broken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only thing she could think of . It turned out to be the perfect thing . She pressed rags to the wound to try to stop the bleeding . Had she applied a tourniquet to the shoulder , almost certainly vital tissue would have been destroyed . The operation would not have been possible . Meanwhile Woodside had dialed the directly emergency number that rings in Police Headquarters as well as in the Fire-Ambulance Station . Car Three of the Somerville police was says cruising nearby . Sgt. Donald MacElree and Patrolman William Heafey arrived within a minute . The time was 2:32 . Three minutes later the ambulance ? actually a retired police paddy wagon ? pulled up , its siren moaning . It was manned by Firemen Edward Cutting and Robert Loan of Engine Three . Mrs. Chmielewski , whoj had been talking to the boy all the while ( " I felt if I kept talking to him , he would n't die " ) , rode to the hospital with them . The odd-looking ambulance drew up to the emergency-ward entrance at 2:39 . The emergency ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police y the hoq arrn thou Dr. L sistant 1 day . a ? and studee.0 shift of police he had had the forethought to phone the hospital . He did n't know then that the arm had been amputated . He said he thought it was a compound fracture . Dr. L. Henry Edmunds Jr . was the assistant resident in surgery in charge that day , and thus in command of the medical and surgical residents and the one " H.M.S. IV " ? a fourth-year Harvard Medical School student ? who make up the 12-hour day shift of doctors . THE wheeled bed carrying Everett Knowles across the corridor into the ward did n't stop at the desk for paperwork . It rolled down the red-tiled hallway and directly into an emergency operating room . A half-dozen staff people were already gathered there . " There was nothing unusual about this , " says Ferdinand Strauss , a tall , spectacled , quiet-voiced man who is the administrator of the emergency ward . " It 's routine whenever we get advance warning that a serious case is coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Edmunds , nor Dr. S. Bert Litwin , his assistant , remembers . exactly when they realized that they were faced with a complete amputation and not a compound fracture . Incredibly , the sleeve still enclosed the severed limb . What the doctors do recall , when a nurse cut away the sleeve , was their reaction . The moment they saw the naked limb they were seized ? simultaneously ? with the wild @#  | @# surmise that the arm could be re-attached . " You 'd have thought the same thing if you had been there , " Dr. Edmunds said . " It looked so perfectly good ? so alive . The only thing wrong was that it had been cut off . " The young doctors knew they had a rare situation . Here was a 12-year-old boy in good health and reasonably calm . He had been brought to the hospital within minutes of the accident . His right arm was off , and they could see a portion of bone sticking out . The fingers of his other hand were crushed , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to happen , this was almost an ideal set of circumstances . But they would need expert help . They began by calling Dr. John B. Herrmann , Edmunds ' immediate superior . He in turn called his next-in-command , Dr. Ronald A. Malt , the quick-thinking young surgeon who was to be the crucial decisionmaker that historic afternoon . In the meantime there was no waiting around . The boy was given a general examination . A blood sample was taken and typed . The boy was prepared-for a transfusion . He had lost about two pints of blood . With a severed artery the situation could have been much worse , but again fate was kind . The brachial artery , pumping blood . that soil . irs with a1 ' % ould like a t " perform ceih simultaneouml be prepared foal decision veal from the heart , had sealed itself off . Two forces were at work here : evolution and youth . Iri the course of man 's development the complex networks of muscles and nerves have built up defenses against injury . Muscles-in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nerves , also in the artery wall , trigger spasms to reinforce the effect . Both of these responses are strongest in young people . " And all this while , " remarks Strauss , " the boy remained fully conscious . He was completely coherent and understanding . You might almost say he was at ease . " Nevertheless at 3:02 the entries in the emergency ward 's logbook changed from blue ink ( not serious ) to red ( critical ) . The boy had been put on the Danger List . Dr. Malt arrived now , and Dr. John Head , assistant staff surgeon . Word had begun to spread throughout the hospital . Before the day was over , everyone from busboys in the basement cafeteria to orderlies on the isolation floor at the top of the White Building would wonder , worry , and pray that the operation would be a success . But would there be an operation ? At five minutes past three no one could say . " The first consideration was that the boy survive and become a useful member of society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put @#  | back an arm and the boy died as a result , or if , later , the arm had to be amputated , no good purpose would be served . " The critical first step was to see if the eins and arteries in the severed arm were open and undamaged . If they were blocked n ? severely injured , there could be no hope of re-establishing circulation . " So , " continued Dr. Malt , " we alerted the operating floor to the unusual circumstance that somebody would be coming upstairs with an amputated arm . We said we would like a full operating room set up to perform certain tests . " Simultaneously the same room was to be prepared for a full-scale operation , if the decision was to go ahead . DR . HERRMANN carried the arm to the elevator and rode the two flights up to the operating floor in the White Building . The arm , wrapped in cloths and shrouded by a sheet , lay in a basin filled with crushed ice . ( The chilling was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malt said later that if chilling had been maintained , it might theoretically have been possible to delay surgery as much as 24 hours . Without this " hypothermia , " serious muscle deterioration would have set in within four hours , followed by rigor mortis . ) When Dr. Herrmann reached Operating Room 5 he found Mrs. Judith Moberly waiting for him . The pretty 24-year-old scrub nurse had been setting up instruments for another operation when the call came from the emergency ward . After Dr. Herrmann had scrubbed up and donned a surgical gown , the two care- fully removed the arm from its wrappings . It was cold and blue-looking . First they bathed it . Then Mrs. Moberly prepared the solution Dr. Herrmann wanted to flush through the artery . In a metal pitcher she mixed saline solution with heparin ? to prevent blood from clotting ? and several antibiotics . Then , very gently , Dr. Herrmann syringed this into the artery . They hoped the solution would flow down the main artery through its branches in the lower arm and return through the venous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were elated . Next came X-rays . A technician stood by ready to take the pictures as soon as a second solution of radio-opaque dye was injected in the arm . This would make the blood vessels show up as dark lines . Down on the first floor the doctors and nurses were readying Everett to leave the emergency ward . His father had arrived and given the ether permit needed in surgery on children . Mrs. Chmielewski , waiting in the lobby , looked down at her blood-stained dress . She wondered how she would get home . She saw one of the firemen-ambulance drivers and asked for a lift . Now Everett was brought up to a small anesthesia room across the hall from O.R . 5 . There Dr. Joan Flacke with the consultation of Dr. David Seigne , Dr. George Battit , and Dr. Henrik Bendixen prepared the boy for anesthesia . The group of specialists mobilized in Everett 's behalf was growing . It would continue to grow . Dr. Bradford Cannon , specialist in plastic surgery , would be called . 75  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service , and Lucian Leape Jr. , an assistant resident surgeon . Other doctors , alerted by the hospital 's speed-of-light grapevine , would offer their services . Some would take an active part in the operation itself . Others would watch from the glassed-in gallery above the operating room , keeping in tou.ch via the intercom . At five minutes past four Dr. Malt decided to try to re-implant the arm . He told Dr. Flacke to begin anesthesia . He went over the X-rays with Dr. Herrmann . The veins and arteries appeared open and clear down to the fingertips . Then he phoned Dr. Robert S. Shaw , a specialist in bloodvessel surgery . He would add one more to the group waiting in Operating Room 5 . Operating Room 5 is a general-surgery room , roughly 20 feet square . It has greentiled walls and a powerful overhead light . Several movable lights and intravenous poles stand on the floor . Built into the walls of the room are linen cupboards , shelves , X-ray screens , and a nest of outlets for AC and DC , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one wall lead into an instrument-sterilizing autoclave , and to a scrub room shared with Operating Room 6 . It was there , many hours later , that the surgery on Everett 's left hand was done . A door on an adjacent wall opens into the corridor across from the anesthesia prep room where Dr. Flacke was working . A few  | moments after Dr. Malt 's decision , Everett was wheeled across this hallway , swathed i- surgical wrappings from head to toe . The operation was about to begin . NOW the room was alive with people : masked , capped , gloved , and gowned ; me in pale blue , some in green . On their feet they wore conductive shoes ? grounded w a strip across the bottom to prevent a static charge from triggering an explosive reaction with the anesthetic gases . Dr. Malt took his position toward the head of the operating table with Dr. Shaw by his side . Across stood Dr. Herrmann . Dr. Flacke and her associates sat forward of the table . For the next eight hours they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They would check his blood pressure , pulse rate , temperature , and depth of anesthesia . They would watch the slow inflation and collapse of the black rebreathing bag that showed his respiration rate . Regularly they would check the gauges and filters on the anesthesia equipment . Regularly , too , they would call out reports to the surgeons concentrating in another world a few feet away . Angled off the foot of the operating table were Nurse Moberly and her instrument tables . One was a six-foot curving surface of glittering steel tools set out on blue sterile drapings . These were the general surgical instruments . Next to this table was a smaller one filled with special orthopedic equipment ? mallets , hacksaws , drills , and hammers ? a complete , but sterile , workshop . There was also a complete set of vascular and skin-grafting instruments . Mrs. Moberly 's job is to hand over scalpels , hemostats , sutures , forceps , clamps ? whatever is requested by a surgeon . She had never gotten a chance to leave O.R . 5 after Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " somehow they knew I would need orthopedic equipment ? and it appeared . " The operating table and the circle of doctors and nurses around it constitute the " sterile " part of the room . Everything and everyone outside this circle is " dirty " ? not germfree . Here is where the orderlies and attendants work . They pick up soiled equipment . They put the blood-soaked sponges on racks , so they can be speedily counted . They alter lights , check equipment , bring in more supplies . They can in fact do almost anything except touch the people or objects in the inner circle . They are the prop men and stagehands who never get to appear on stage . THE first crucial step in the operation to re-implant Everett Knowles ' arm was to sew the veins and artery back together to restore circulation . The veins are the brachial veins , a group that encircle the artery . Dr. Shaw supervised this part of the operation . It is a job that takes enormous patience and skill . One problem is the size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small vessels and the stresses and strains put upon them , many fine sutures must be taken . Another problem is elasticity . While blood-vessel walls will stretch a little , doctors prefer to link the ends of severed veins with a tubular insert if a large gap exists . The insert can be a graft of tissue from another part of the body , or a dacron sheath . Doctors generally prefer grafts . " A piece of meat is better than a piece of cloth , " Dr. Shaw comments .  | In the Knowles case the doctors did n't have to resort to a graft because of a complication in the injury itself . They had had to remove an inch of bone that was too shattered to repair . While this means that the arm will always lack an inch in length , it gave them a chance to remove any doubtful-looking tissue at the severed points and have enough left to link good tissue with good tissue . Dr. Shaw rejoined two of the brachial veins with 20 to 30 dacron sutures taken around the circumferences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The delicate job took time . The artery and veins were only about one-sixth of an inch thick . It was now six o'clock , two hours since the operation had begun . Clamps were pinching back the blood supply in Everett 's body above the severed area . Tension showed in the surgeons ' brows , damp with the sweat of work and worry . Finally the moment had come . No one of the 20-odd people in O.R . 5 or the gallery above spoke ? or even breathed ? as Dr. Malt gave the order to unclamp the vessels . Almost immediately , the arm , still blue-white and cold ? a corpse-like extremity ? began to warm and turn pink , suffused by the fresh blood pumped in from the boy 's heart . The doctors felt for ? and found ? a pulse beating . The doctors glanced up from the table and exchanged looks of thanks . Beneath his mask Dr. Shaw smiled . The first phase of the operation was a success . NEXT came the work on the bone , the humerus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shoulder joint . One surgeon described the bone ends as looking as if the arm had been laid on a bar and whacked with a sledge into splintery fragments . These fragments had been removed , along with bits of lifeless skin and muscle . Now infinite pain would have to be taken in setting the bone for fear of rupturing the rejoined blood vessels . Dr. Malt decided that a clover-shaped length of steel tubing would be the best means of nailing the bone together . This odd-shaped " Kiintscher " nail would provide a three-point contact to prevent the bone from rotating and give it the stability it needed . At the same time , it would not impair the blood supply . The exact length needed ? 63i inches @# ? had been measured , and Dr. Leape sawed off a length of rod with a sterile hacksaw . The rod was held in a vise placed on the corner of an instrument table and anchored there by a nurse . Dr. Malt now drove the nail through the marrow cavity of the stump bone , using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arm in place , orthopedic surgeon Mitchell forced the severed arm on to the free end of the nail . Using his hands alone , he applied pressure from the elbow area . The time was now 9:00 . The bone surgery had taken almost three hours . There was still the mangled left hand to worry about . But first another vital lifeline had to be considered : the nerves . Would the chief surgeons around the table attempt the tricky business of nerve grafts now ? The procedure was time-consuming . Three main bundles of them in the arm had to be reconnected . There are myriad fine fibers in these , covered by protective sheaths , that trail down to the fingertips in one direction , track back to the brain or spinal cord in the other . How could the surgeons tell how much damage had been done ? If the boy had been thrown from a train he might well have sustained some nerve injury back toward the spinal cord . Then no amount of stitching at the point where the nerves were broken would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Dr. Malt . The boy had been under anesthesia for more than five hours . He had received six pints of blood , four more in addition to the emergency-room transfusions . Malt shook his head . It would be better to postpone the nerve grafts . Instead they would join the outer sheaths of the nerves with heavy dacron sutures . They would then be easy to identify at a later operation . NOW the basic surgery of reconnection was finished . But there was still work to be done . One task was to remove fatally damaged areas of tissue . Usually this " debriding " is done at the outset , and indeed some lifeless tissue had already been cleared away . But the unique quality of the arm operation determined a different logic : The major debriding would have to wait until they had restored circulation . Then the surgeons could see which tissue would have an adequate blood supply .  | After this there was the task of rejoining the soft tissue across the break , the con. - plex layers of muscle and tendon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - fully sutured the layers . But some skin w. missing , and more was irreparable . Tv. areas ? one behind the armpit , one over the . shoulder in back ? had to be left raw . Again the decision was to wait , in this . case for only a few days . Then if infection had been avoided and healing begun , tin - would graft skin from other parts of the . boy 's body to cover the exposed place ' The surgeons placed sterile dressings over the sites , and under the supervision of D : Mitchell a large plaster cast called .. " spica " was fitted to the boy . Dr. Malt now felt that O.R . 5 had outlived its usefulness and might even be a source of infection were they to continue there with the second operation on Everett 's hand . So , still in deep sleep , the boy was wheeled from O.R . 5 into the corridor and down the hall to O.R . 6 . The mangled fingers and thumb of Everett 's left hand were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ split-thickness grafts ? sections of skin that include most but not all the layers of tissue . Grafts were taken from Everett 's right foot . When these grafts had been completed by Dr. Leape the second operation was over . The total time for surgery had been eight hours . The boy had been anesthetized for 8'z hours . He was moved now to one of the narrow railed beds used in the recovery room . There a staff of nurses in surgical gowns tend post-operative patients , watching the " vital signs " of blood pressure , pulse , and respiration . Shelves along the walls of the room are lined with plugs or attachments for whatever solutions or equipment a surgeon may order for his patient . Soft music plays in the room all day long . ( One doctor calls it the " tranquilizer waltz . " ) Everett stayed in the recovery room over 24 hours . Head Nurse Polly Jacques ' report by this time sounded familiar : The boy was conscious soon after the operation . He was calm and cooperative . EVERETT 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was a measure to protect him . The rooms there are screened to keep out flies . Inside each room there is a foot-pedal sink and laun- dry-disposal unit . Outside , there is a row plaques stating the precautions visitors were to take . Everett 's visitors got the works Anyone seeing him had to wash up first . then wear a surgical gown and mask . Five days after the operation Everett was taken down to the operating door : again . The cast was removed . Happily , the wound looked the way ' the doctors hoped it would . The raw areas were ready to receive skin grafts . The boy was readied h , surgery again and anesthetized . Again splitthickness grafts were used , this time take : . from the right thigh . In a few days they were checked and found to be growing . On June 13 ? exactly three weeks to the day Everett came into the hospital ? he was discharged . But the story was n't over . 1 The boy now had an arm firmly rejoined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it . It lay in a cast . Every day the muscles of r his fingers had to be exercised . Daily he had to come to the physiotherapy department of the hospital se that his forearm muscles could be stimulated electrically . They could not be allowed to grow slack . On Sept. 11 , the doctors went ahead with the crucial nerve surgery . In a 6 1/2-hour operation they rejoined the media , radial , and ulnar nerves which had bed loosely sutured originally , plus one mon the musculocutanecus . Much scar tissue had to be removed . In two of the nerve the shearing off was so extensive that tissue grafts from the boy 's upper arm and lei hip had to be taken to fill the gaps . Now the doctors face a long waiting period ? at least six months ? before the . know if they have succeeded . Nerves grow ' ' that slowly . The doctors have no idea how mud nerve regeneration there may be . So they are cautious ? but optimistic . The boy is young . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are better than those of adults . The doctors feel that Everett will be able to use his arm " enough to gain his livelihood . " The arm may lack some fine sensitivity but it will be a useful one . One that can pick up objects , grasp things . So while no one is jubilant , there is guarded hope . The surgeons do not congratulate themselves on a breakthrough . They merely combined a number of complex and radical steps in one long operation . : ' 192 All the techniques had been tried separatr:i. on other occasions . But they have learned much from this experience and expect to learn more . The : . are grateful for the competence and quick thinking that characterized every role in the story . They are grateful to the emergency-ward staff . To the ambulance drivers . To the police . To Norman Woodside . And to Mrs. Chmielewski . So is Everett . @#
