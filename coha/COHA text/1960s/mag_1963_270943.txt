After their coup , South Viet Nam 's rebels announced that President Ngo Dinh Diem and his brother , Ngo Dinh Nhu , were killed in an armored car when Nhu scuffled with an army captain over a gun . Hardly anyone believed that story . According to a likelier version , the brothers were taken to Joint General Staff Headquarters ; Diem refused to announce his resignation and Nhu started cursing-whereupon one of the generals pulled his gun and shot them . In any case , the new government to this day terms their deaths " accidental suicide . " <P> Since then , the Saigon press corps has been given glimpses of photographs purporting to show the brothers in death , by a mysterious , elusive little man who offered to sell copies to the highest bidder , but then invariably disappeared . Last week United Press International finally acquired two such pictures from an unidentified source . In the photographs the brothers hardly look like suicide victims , accidental or otherwise . Both are still wearing the Roman Catholic priests ' robes in which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces are bloodied and bruised , Nhu 's hands tied behind his back ( see cut ) . <P> Still a mystery is the whereabouts of the bodies . Fortnight ago , a picture peddler appeared again , this time exhibiting photographs of two coffins , marked Ngo Dinh Diem and Ngo Dinh Nhu , on trestles , with an unidentified army officer standing near by . Other prints showed the coffins , decorated with flowers and candles , beside two freshly dug graves , and a European priest in the foreground along with a Vietnamese man and woman said to be Diem relatives . The site was said to be a cemetery within the compound of Joint General Staff Headquarters .
