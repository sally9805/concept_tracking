txt The year 1970 is shaping up as another difficult one for the United States economy . Fiscal and monetary restraints this year have had a slower and less pronounced effect on the economy than expected . The cost of living still gallops ahead at a 5 percent annual rate . The 1970 sequel to 1969 calls for continued tight reins on monetary policy , another year of slow growth in real terms , probably some rise in unemployment , and more profit squeeze . Until there are clearer signs that inflation , as well as inflationary expectations , are decreasing , the government has little choice . Yet , slowly rising unemployment may force it to think about ways to reflate the economy without promoting inflation . One way : Wage-price controls which , until now , the Nixon administration has said " no " to . 0 ? London bullion-dealers think a floor and a ceiling now have been established for gold on the free market . Recently the price has fallen sharply to $36 an ounce . A large amount of hoarded gold is believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as $2 billion worth . But the prospect of a drop to a price below the $35 official market price is discounted . It is felt that if this did happen , governments would step in to bolster their reserves by buying cheap in the free market , forcing the price up again .. Meanwhile , the United States and South Africa probably will come to an agreement on official sales of newly mined gold , probably reducing the amount available for the free gold market . At the same time industrial and artistic demand for gold is increasing . Both these trends would tend to move the free price up again . And if " the will to hoard " were to increase at the tame time , because of renewed distrust of paper money , then the free price might go to record heights . However , there is no sign at present of any great " will to hoard . " And while there is n't , the price of gold on the free market is thought unlikely to break through the $40 mark . Some dealers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established . e Next month 's White House Conference on Food , Nutrition , and Health may have broad impact on the food industry and consumers . Subjects up for discussion at the three-day meeting range from improving food distribution in low-income areas to new ground rules on food additives . Early soundings suggest the conference will back : ? A reevaluation of food additives to determine efficacy and safety . ? Stricter labeling requirements so that all food products will list a breakdown of ingredients . ? Expanded government programs to help ghetto consumers improve their meals . ? Clearer standards of identity for new types of foods that simulate staples . The housing dip is no short-term affair . Economic pressures on Washington suggest things will get worse before they get better . Figures on October housing starts , released this month , were the lowest this year ? an annual rate of only 1.34 million and a hefty drop from September 's 1.57 million rate . Chief cause is no secret : tight money policies that still are being pursued in the effort to squeeze out inflation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Nixon gets down to the brass tacks of his budget for next year , it is becoming plain that keeping restrictive policies in place on the fiscal ( taxing and spending ) side is going to be a tough trick . In fact , unless Congress extends the income-tax surcharge at least until June 30 , Budget Director Robert P. Mayo warns that about two-thirds of this year 's budget surplus may go down the drain , too . Trends .. . Congress is likely to ignore crucial sections of President Nixon 's foreign-trade program . Even so , the message is a blow to protectionism . It calls for repeal of the American selling price ( ASP ) System of setting tariffs on a few imports . This is done on the basis of the market price of the corresponding U.S.-made product , not the lower price of the import . Mr. Nixon notes that to European nations ASP is more important symbolically than economically . True . It is also an important symbol of White House trade policy . And free trade has won out , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least for now .
