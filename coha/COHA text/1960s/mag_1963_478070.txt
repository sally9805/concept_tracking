adays the " right people " have to be the bright people in order to get in . . . and the " Character " or " Values " they aim at are changing ? or should be . IN STUDY hall one day at the staid girls ' school in New York which I attended for eight long winters , a certain Cynthia took a scented sheet of notepaper from her desk and began with frequent , audible sighs to compose a letter . After a while she got up and left the room , leaving the letter on her desk . Inscribed to a certain Harold at Saint Paul 's School , it read , " It is after midnight and I 'm writing this under a blanket with a flashlight so that Mother wo n't know ... " Of the twenty or so girls in the room ? we all read the letter ? I was the only one who was puzzled by Cynthia 's approach . The others were trying to figure out just who Harold was and how Cynthia had bagged him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classmates and at the same time trying to understand them , The outlook I was intent on understanding was that of the prep-school girl , that is , the girl of upper-class or upper-middle-class background who attends a private ( or " independent " ) school . In many ways she does not differ from girls of similar background who attend public schools in rich suburban neighborhoods ; like them , for instance , she dresses with more restraint than many teen-agers , remaining faithful to her now famous caste mark , the circular gold pin , and to the single strand of pearls , graduated so that the small beads at the back of the neck are no bigger than tomato seeds . The prep-school girl is a rare bird , however : in 1960 there were perhaps about 12,000 of them ( around 120,000 boys and girls , not counting those in the parochial system , wereattending independent schools out of a total school population of forty-three million ) . More important , the prep-school girl 's parents are extremely ambitious for her . She must be " accomplished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sail a boat , play tennis , bridge , the piano , run a fleeting according to parliamentary law , and speak French . At the same time she must be accepted by a well-known college . All this involves ? unless she is athletic and agile-mindecla great deal of hard work . Moreover , as an apprentice for upper- and upper-middle-class life she must acquire what the upper class , in the British tradition , calls " Character " and the upper-middle class calls " Values . " They amount to the same thing . To guarantee the fulfillment of their ambitions , the parents rely on thirty or so highly regarded independent day and boarding schools for girls which are located , with Few exceptions , in the Eastern and Middle Atlantic States . Developed over the last 150 years , these schools differed from one another from the start . Abbot Academy and Emma Willard School , the two oldest ( founded in 1829 and 1814 respectively ) , encouraged their pupils to be intellectually minded and prepared them , if they had to earn their living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( known as Farmington , 1843 ) provided a good education , but of the " finishing-school " variety ? the incurious were prodded into curiosity only for the length of time they spent at the school , The early schools , however , were all founded before the women 's colleges developed . Formal study came to an end with the " season of improvement , " as Emma Willard , the first woman among American educators , called the adolescent years of a girl 's life . With the growth of the women 's colleges later in the nineteenth century , new schools were founded , like Shipley and Brearley , with a college-preparatory purpose ; 74 GUIDE TO GIRLS ' SCHOOLS education acquired between fourteen and seventeen became a springboard to higher study . Marty schools , of course , such as Farmington , continued until about twenty years ago to provide a " finishing " education ; only the exceptional student went to college from these establishments . Other schools , such as Saint Catherine 's in Richmond and the Spence School in New York provided both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World War II almost every reputable girls ' school has instituted an exclusively college-preparatory program . Despite their present strongly academic emphasis , many girls ' schools are still social forcing-houses in the sense that the " right people " attend them . The difference is that now only the bright " right people " are accepted . The various schools do , of course , serve different clienteles . For the past seventy years or so Foxcroft , Farmington , Saint Timothy 's , Shipley , Chapin , Winsor , Madeira , and Ethel Walker have served what is thought of as " society . " This means that over the years they have always had a sizable contingent of girls from the Social Register 's winnowing of Boston , New York , and Philadelphia . The tastes and manners of these girls usually set the tone of the schools . Parents from , say , Grosse Pointe , Lake Forest , Houston , and Pebble Beach who want their daughters to grow up in the national league send them to these schools , hoping that they will make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education . Often several years ' finishing of this sort becomes a tradition in a family or among a certain group in a community . Thus a number of Richmond families have been sending their children to Saint Timothy 's in Maryland for three generations . Sometimes , too , parents consider that they are " broadening " their daughter 's outlook by sending her away to one of these schools . A Boston mother told a former principal of Shipley ( which is outside Philadelphia ) that she was so glad her daughter had been accepted because it would be good for her to " get away from the East coast . " Some of the other schools which have been connected with " society , " but not quite so long and not so markedly , are Milton Academy , Chatham Hall , Garrison Forest , the Masters School , and Katharine Branson ( the last in California ; the rest are in the East ) . in practice , most cities of any size boast girls ' schools which serve the upper middle class of the area , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend Katherine Delmar Burke ; in Chicago , the Girls ' Latin School associated with the Boys ' Latin ; in Cleveland , Hathaway Brown , one of the best schools in the country . In the suburbs parents who do not want to send their daughters away to boarding school often have a country-day school at hand ; such schools are sometimes coeducational , like the North Shore Country Day School in Winnetka , Illinois . The New York girls ' schools are particularly hard to categorize , except for the fact that the background of their students tends to he more cosmopolitan and varied than that of suburban country-day or boarding schools . Brearley is one of the finest schools in the country , serving students not as members of a social class but as individuals . Chapin has remained truest to the Social Register , but it is excellent academically and in time it will probably begin to attract a more varied clientele . Spence is a typical middle-of-the-road school , providing a sound education without coming out strongly in favor of either the individual or the creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools ? Abbot Academy in Andover , Massachusetts ; the Emma Willard School in Troy , New York ; the Beard School in Orange , New Jersey ; Saint Catherine 's in Richmond , Virginia ; and the Foxcroft School in Middleburg , Virginia ? a choice not as arbitrary as it appears , for taken together , these five provide a fair idea of the various ways the prep-school girl spends her " season of improvement . " TO THE MANOR BRED N O SCHOOL could be more of a world unto itself than Foxcroft , and yet no school tries more explicitly to impress upon its students that behavior at Foxcroft is a preparation and a sign of what they should expect of themselves after leaving school . The school is set in mellow country outside Middleburg . Along with the well-heeled , horsy set of the neighborhood , Fox-croft believes that it enjoys the pleasures of rural life while staying in touch with the world ? by watching President Kennedy 's helicopter pass overhead from time to lime . Like most girls ' schools , Foxcroft is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founders , that person , Charlotte Haxall Noland , is still alive . Although " Miss Charlotte " is no longer active in the daily administration of the school , her presence is in the air . She is a handsome , piercing , white-haired woman . Queen Elizabeth II asked particularly to meet her when she visited this country . Her secretary says of her that she has a " hickory quality , " but Miss Charlotte has a capacity for fun as well : middle-aged alumnae , settled and bejeweled , reminisce , as if these were the most treasured anecdotes of their youth , about the time Miss Charlotte hung a tree with marshmallows in the woods , or about her yearly nocturnal Coon Hunt . , . . In 1914 Miss Charlotte founded Foxcroft on the property where her family had lived for six generations ; she managed to graft the school onto their traditions ? traditions which valued rigorous good health , fox-hunting , paternalistic benevolence toward those ( especially Negroes ) less privileged than oneself , mild Christianity with a strong ethical bent , wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeed from the start , for it was precisely this set of virtues which , at the turn of the century , the socially well-established and the millionaires striving for a firm footing in " society " wanted to make their own . Today the school has seven applicants for every girl it takes ( there are only 125 in the school ; 41 daughters of alumnae ) , handsome brick buildings constructed with the funds of Carnegies , Dillons , and others of that ilk , and a sound , four-year , college-preparatory program . Whereas in 1935 only seven girls from a class of twenty-six went to college , nowadays some three-fourths of the graduating class , which numbers thirty-odd , enter college each year . But it is Character above all which Foxcroft sets out to develop , and this is at least as easy to develop outside the classroom as within it . To " take " at all well , Character must be presented as a passport to a community so appealing that only the born malingerer can hold out . At Fox-croft tire incentive is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride with the Middleburg Hunt ? in the company of old gentlemen in baggy tweeds and rubicund matrons riding side-saddle in the best English blue-serge habits . Another inducement to the development of Character is the unique Foxcroft Corps , instituted during World War II . ' The entire school drills twice a week under the instruction of an Army officer , carrying dummy rifles and tricked out in uniforms adapted from those of Colonel Mosby 's raiders , who , during the Civil War , were quartered in the eighteenth-century Brick Housewhich is now the hub of the school . It 's no use laughing ; ( he Corps " works " in the sense that most of ( he girls are loyal to it . Schools , like other small communities , tend to be strongly attached to whatever is uniquely their own . The girls are not asked , however , to accept whatever physical and moral virtues may be derived from drilling as rewards sufficient in themselves : at Commencement the entire Marine Drum and Bugle Corps come down from Washington to lead the Corps in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day dreamers . The arrival of the mail is the day 's most important event for most students . They have far fewer opportunities for contact with the opposite sex than most girls their age , seeing them only in vacation and during the summer , But despite the drab atmosphere ? no lipstick , tan corduroy skirts , green blazers ? I noticed that one girl had a spit curl trained across her cheek with a long strip of Scotch tape ; another wore a Cleopatra double-snake-head bracelet high on her arm under the sleeve of her gym blouse . " These girls need discipline , " one member of the faculty commented , According to the prevailing attitude , the students are good-hearted girls , but not yet ready to make competent decisions ; this approach may be inescapable at Foxcroft and other schools catering to the alternately coddled and neglected daughters of the very rich and prominent . Sometimes as many as half the school have divorced parents ; there is a good deal of emotional repair work to he done , but I wondered whether fox-hunting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best of remedies . INTO HER MOTHER 'S SHOES I N appearance the Beard School and Saint Catherine 's have much in common . At both the main buildings are brick , a simplified scholastic Georgian , painted white at Beard and left red at Saint Catherine 's . There are playing fields for hockey and lacrosse , grounds planted with cherry trees and magnolias , and , when I visited the schools , tulips in bloom . The nearby streets are lined with trees at least thirty years tall , immaculate , wcedIess lawns , and houses which run the gamut from the comfortable , porch-encumbered 1910 style to the Hansel and Gretel Tudor of the ' twenties . It is the life behind these apparently lifeless facades which determines the real similarities as well as the differences between the schools , and , incidentally , between the surrounding towns : 76 GUIDE TO GIRLS ' SCHOOLS Orange , New jersey , and Richmond , Virginia . At Saint Catherine 's more than half of the day students in every senior class have attended the school for thirteen years ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both take day as well as boarding students and provide departments for the elementary grades ) . At Beard in 1961-62 , only one senior had been there all the way through , As such things go , the population of Richmond is stable , whereas that of Orange is relatively mobile . There are , of course , families who have " always lived " in Orange , but the community is interlarded with those of men , who , on their way " up " in some large corporation or industry , are sent to New York for a few years . Orange is the territory Philip Roth writes of ; Richmond in 1961 is still not far removed from the city Ellen Glasgow knew . This difference is reflected in the varying ambitions a girl 's parents have for her in the two communities . In both places they want her to get into college . Parents in Orange , however , are considerably more determined to have their daughter finish college than they are in Richmond . " You have to have something to fall back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beard told me . At Saint Catherine 's on the other hand , although virtually every graduate enters college , a high proportion leave to marry before finishing . Only the exceptional girl thinks of a career . " Most of us have a picture , " one Saint Catherine 's girl told me ; " we want to get married and live in a white house in the suburbs . " Her parents subscribe to what one teacher at the school ruefully termed , the " Ladies ' Home journal point of view , " which might not be too unfairly described as a belief that they represent the American way of life at its best ? substantial , hard-working , civic , Protestant , more tasteful all the time , and whenever possible monogamous . At Foxcroft one senses that a girl is half-afraid as well as half-seduced by the sophisticated world she stands on the brink of ; she is not quite sure she will be able or will want to fit herself to the pre-established pattern which her family and school adhere to . The Beard or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ready to step into her mother 's shoes . Stepping into one 's mother 's shoes tends to encourage the conviction that one has a monopoly on righteousness at a very young age . An insidious taste for the ironic has made me a frequent victim of this conviction ( nothing threatens the Ladies ' flow Journal point of view as much as irony ) . " I hope that we agree onends , even if we ca n't agree on means , " a classmate once said to me . I think I had been flippant about the cumbersome , serious-minded organization of a charity drive . just the other day , a spiritual sister of this former fellow student said to me , " I 'm glad to see that our goals are the same . " I 'm not sure whether we had been talking about child care or cooking , But , despite the sense of righteousness it affords , stepping into one 's mother 's shoes too young can he accompanied by deep uncertainties which become evident once a girl is married . The role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Will she be equal to a game which is played without a break ? " I 'm having one of my mother 's friends to tea today , " a young woman remarked to me , " and I do n't know which way to slice the lemon ? in quarters or slices . " At both Beard and Saint Catherine 's Values must be inculcated without the help of the manor-house myth which Foxcroft uses to build Character . Beard relies on the game-like pressure to participate , strong in all good schools ; Values are accepted without question as the rules of the game . As a church school , operating under the auspices of the Episcopal Diocese of Virginia , Saint Catherine 's can present Values in a specifically religious setting . A Bible course , chapel attendance , and the planning and conduct of services are compulsory . Fund-raising and other charity work is organized by a students ' group , the Saint Catherine 's League . The ideals are spiritual ; the worthy endeavors of the school do not suffer from the taint of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the aura of noblesse oblige , heavy in the air at Foxcroft , is noticeably absent at Saint Catherine 's . Nevertheless , the headmistress admits that her girls are " enthusiastic managers . " j'HARD ON A GIRL " B EH/ND every seventeen-year-old " enthusiastic manager " stand two forty-year-old " enthusiastic managers , " her parents , pillars of their community and country club . A school may want to think in terms of the service it does a girl , but it is her parents who constitute its clientele . Since an independent school depends on private funds and private patronage , it will quite literally go out of business if it does not provide what its clientele is looking for . A school can , of course , do something to educate its clientele , but only if its administration is brave and confident and its clientele receptive . Almost without exception , girls ' independent schools have followed rather than led those they serve , taken few risks , and as a consequence developed a defensive attitude . Currently they are edgy about one issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " educationally deprived " ; in plain talk , this means Negro students , of whom there are very few in these schools ? none at Foxcroft , Beard , or Saint Catherine 's for instance . " People will accept things for their sons which they wo n't accept for their daughters , " one headmistress commented bluntly , but it is not only fear of their clientele 's reaction to Negro students which holds the school back . Private schooling for girls is expensive ; the basic fee for board and tuition at Saint Catherine 's is $2,000 ; at Foxcroft , $3,000 ; at Garrison Forest , $2,800 ; at Saint Timothy 's , $3,000 ; at Shipley , $2,750 . And there are plenty of extras after that . Sheer cost restricts girls ' independent schools to a narrower range of students than boys ' preparatory schools , which are far better endowed and consequently have much lower tuitions . Small endowments also mean that girls ' schools have little scholarship money to offer students from low socio-economic backgrounds . In addition , there is the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent school can be hard for students whose earlier education has been inadequate . For any one of these reasons headmistresses tend to talk themselves into sitting tight and doing nothing . Frequently this tendency is reinforced by an unconscious premise , which they share with their clientele , that , while there is nothing quite so fine as Values , they must n't go so far as to imply a need for change . The worst rationalization of all , and a frequent one , is the argument that being a Ione Negro in a school or one of very few would be " hard on a girl . " A lot of things are hard , including the denial of the particular education you are seeking . Moreover , schools like Dalton , Westover , Brearlev , Emma Willard , and Abbot ? where the administration has taken a stand and Negro students have been accepted ? prove that a good start can be made . Abbot Academy 's service to the " educationally cleprhed " is particularly unusual for a girls ' school . About three years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive letters from African leaders , pleading with her to take as many girls as she could . The school has accepted qualified Negroes for some time ( and , incidentally , never found the experience " hard " on them ) . With Africans , however , as some of the boys ' schools have discovered , differences of background and preparation can be formidable . Nevertheless , a girl recommended by the Kenyan 78 GUIDE TO GIRLS ' SCHOOLS leader , Tom Mboya , sounded promising , and the students were asked for their opinion . Their answer was to raise the money needed for the girl 's passage and for her tuition at the school . In the art studio I saw one of her paintings ? a bright , abstract scene of an African village , the rounded huts painted in shades of pink , red , and blue ? hanging beside the introspective , realistic , teen-age self-portraits of her American classmates . Nevertheless , even when their outlook is liberal , independent schools take only the gifted Negro , the gifted Jew , and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " failure " with a student from a minority group and , in consequence , accept only the " sure bet , " which usually means a very special person indeed . A girl from Nairobi is at Abbot today partly because the school , still attached to the ideals of an earlier New England , remembers Harriet Beecher Stowe , a fast friend ( she organized a fair to raise funds for a new building ) while she lived in Andover at the time Uncle Tom 's Cabin was appearing in serial form . " If I 'd gone to high school at home , " said one student from a nearby Massachusetts town , " I could have taken calculus , but I 've gotten something else here , more of an education . " Along with Brearley , Shipley , and Emma Willard , Abbot is probably one of the liveliest girls ' schools in the country . Here a girl is not afraid to let her intelligence show ; she is full of views on every subject from Castro to Kennedy and has hale use for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have blond hair and wear Lanz dresses and talk about boys and diets . " Whereas the Beard and Saint Catherine 's girl seems almost too poised and , in a strange , probably superficial way , too mature for her years , Abbot girls have a kind of eagerness , a hint of being willing to put themselves out on a limb which contrasts pleasantly with the rather controlled manner of their contemporaries . Abbot is vehemently in favor of college preparation . In order to stay ahead in the race for college admission , the school takes fewer and fewer students of average ability . " We turn away girls with an IQ of 110 all the time , " the academic dean commented . The pressure is intense ; one girl confided that sometimes " you feel like a machine . " Abbot sends more girls to four-year colleges than the average girls ' school , and far fewer of its graduates drop out , but the academic pressure its students experience is by no means unique . The same pressure can be found at any good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bition as much as anything which forces a school to put pressure on students . " We all come from families who are interested in education , " one girl at Abbot said . Interested for a variety of reasons , as we have seen in relation to Beard and Saint Catherine 's , but in general because they feel that an education has become the essential passport to opportunity , social as well as professional . These arc the people who forced one New York City school to send out an extra report card early in the year so that they could keep up with their daughter 's progress ; who are " pathetically grateful " for word of how she is doing ; who think that if they send her to a good secondary school she will automatically be accepted by a " name " college ; who say , as one headmistress put it , " that you 're ' discouraging ' if you point out that a certain college they 've set their hearts on is too hard for their daughter . " " Sometimes the pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " one Abbot girl said . " In the old days , " one experienced teacher told me , " you used to feel that for a day or a week at a time you had caught the imagination of the class ; now they just want to know the right answer for the test . " EXPOSED TO A LOT I N THE past , it was the gifted who were often short-changed by the independent schools ; perhaps it 's inevitable that they should now be treated like racehorses for a few years at least , and that average students should be somewhat cheated . Today girls of middling ability often can not get into a good school , or , once in , are made to feel second-rate . " I guess I 'll have to be an interior decorator like my mother , " one young lady told me , as if this were the worst of all possible fates . " I do n't think I 'd be much good at anything else . " The middling people can not be neglected much longer ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the financial resources to provide a varied program , catering to a wide gamut of interests and abilities . Harriet Beecher Stowe 's educator algebraic formulas , and obscure points of American history ? the fragmentary ammunition of testtaking ? she may not see the woods for the trees . Emma Willard is one of the few girls ' schools to insist that its students not lose sight of the overall pattern of what they are studying . To make this possible the school has devised an experimental solution to the problem of a girl 's specific educational needs . Emma Hart Willard was no feminist , at least not in a derogatory sense , yet so advanced were her ideas on education that her school was renowned not only in this country but in Europe . Ti. first opened in Middlebury , Vermont , in 1814 and moved to Troy , New York , in 1819 , where its academic Gothic buildings today sit stark and formal on a lawn-covered hill on the outskirts of the city . For nineteen years , Miss Anne Wellington and Miss Clemewell Lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their place has been taken by William M. Dietel , a former Amherst professor ) , worked to bring their great predecessor 's ideals up to date with the institution of the " Emma Willard Plan . " The plan involves a degree of correlation between fields which is rare at the high-school level ; history , literature , music , and art , although taught in separate courses , are not permitted to remain in compartments , airtight from one another in a girl 's mind . Unlike most schools , Emma Willard has made no changes in its curriculum as a result of college pressures . Every student must take courses in the history of art and of music . ( At the school I attended , history of art was studied almost exclusively by those not intending to go to a four-year college . One teacher taught courses in mythology and remedial reading ? to roughly the same people . ) In the same way she must take a year of Latin , presented , however , not as a mere stepping-stone to Caesar but as an introduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may take specific courses in physics , chemistry , or botany , she must take two general science courses , one emphasizing the biological and the other the physical sciences . " The main point at this age , " said one member of the Emma Willard faculty , speaking of the high-school years , " is to arouse enthusiasm . We expose them to a lot and out of that many find a continuing interest . " This " continuing interest " should he the 1961 prep-school girl 's substitute for " accomplishments . " Her talents are needed ; she need not go as far as Jacqueline Kennedy ( a Farmington graduate ) , but she should not sit fallow forever in the " white house in the suburbs . " Miss Wellington and Miss Lay understood that the liberal-arts background which is the springboard to such an interest should come early in her life ; she is ready for it in the " season of improvement . " The secret is to present material in sufficient depth and in sufficiently sharp focus to arouse more than passing enthusiasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps to reveal the connection between culture ( what one learns in a classroom ) and Values or Character ( what one learns in morning chapel or in an after-dinner chat with the headmistress ) . It may seem self-evident that there are Values in , say , Dostocvsky , but , as Martin Mayer pointed out in The Schools , this is not clear in the average American school , any more than it is in middle-and upper-class communities in this country . In such circles a Value is something which , crudely , can be reduced to an ethical precept or formula for living . One has to go to college before anyone suggests that a Greek statue embodies , albeit not in didactic form , an attitude toward life . At Emma Willard , this point is made , however ; the result is that the activities of the school seem far more coherent than at any other I visited , Emma Willard harnesses a girl 's newly articulate sense of individuality and makes it the impetus of education . Many other girls ' schools would do well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepare girls , explicitly or implicitly , for the dubious future of membership in a social class . They are reluctant , however , for like the communities they serve , they fear that in the process something of what they care for will be lost . No doubt it may ; fox-hunting is getting more expensive all the time . But the things they most care for ? the ideals which they sum up as Character and Values ? are internal , intangible . It is pessimistic indeed to believe that these standards and qualities of character can develop only within the setting of a specific class . At Abbot some years ago the original school building was moved from its first location to its present one . The story goes that when the building was moved , someone forgot to remove a reproduction of the Portland Vase from one of the classrooms . Alarms and accusations ensued , but the vase was intact when the move was over . If they are to continue to make a place for themselves in this country , girls ' schools must soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to appreciate a fine Greek vase can travel and adjust to changing times and circumstances at least as well as the vase itself .
