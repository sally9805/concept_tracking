Against the hills of Bolton Landing overlooking New York State 's Lake George , he appeared a great bear of a man , wrestling his huge sculptures about the landscape to make his own private outdoor museum . In his workshop studio , he preferred the garb of a professional welder , though he could also work with tools as delicate as the dentist 's drill . At night , he would turn gourmet , top off the evening with cigars , some Mozart , and occasionally dipping into James Joyce . Possessed by work and his own projects , he would grumble : " It always astounds me that I can make something that somebody does n't understand . " <P> Recognition came late for Sculptor David Smith , and neither his manner , often truculent , nor his medium - gigantic welded iron and steel objects - did much to hasten his fame . Awarded a $1,000 prize at the 1961 Carnegie International , he refused the money , suggested that it be used by the museum to buy some art . " Sculpture has been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> " Before it was cast , the man who paid for it had certain reservations and designations . " Smith preferred to work directly with raw iron and steel , kept his prices high , and if there were no buyers , well , there was always more room in the fields . <P> One He Never Saw .

Ironically , it is the one he never saw . In May 1965 , while returning home from visiting an artist friend in Bennington , Vt. , he drove off the road and was killed . But though his death at the age of 59 robbed him of accolades abroad , he had by his independence set the life style for a generation of admiring young artists , earned from critics a reputation as the most powerful new force in sculpture to emerge on the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calder early became a world figure by giving movement to sculpture with his mobiles , and Jacques Lipchitz developed his own tragic vision in the New World while still using traditional casting techniques , David Smith seemed to gain strength from wrestling directly with the raw materials of the steel age . His own work , Smith insisted , should be viewed both with the eye of a poet and of a workman , and he was proud that he had mastered his craft . A dropout from Ohio University after his freshman year , Smith studied art under John Sloan in New York , but he had also been a riveter in Studebaker 's South Bend plant , assembled locomotives and M7 tanks during World War II .
