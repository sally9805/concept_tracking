When he filled out the application forms for U.S. citizenship in 1963 , Canadian-born Clive M. Boutilier , 32 , reported that he had once been arrested for a homosexual act , but the charges were dismissed . Pressed for more details , the Manhattan building-maintenance man , who had been living in the U.S. for eight years , revealed his assorted relations with both sexes since the age of 14 . As a result , Boutilier was ordered deported . Reason : the 1952 Immigration Act bars any alien with a " psychopathic personality . " <P> Using psychiatrists ' statements that he has no such thing , Boutilier took his case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit . Last week that court , in a 2-1 decision , rejected Boutilier 's appeal on the ground that " psychopathic personality " legally means what Congress was too circumspect to say , " No homosexuals allowed . " <P> Judge Irving R. Kaufman traced the euphemism to the Public Health Service , which devised it as an admittedly " vague and indefinite " rubric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex perverts . " However medically imprecise , said Kaufman , the phrase became " a legal term of art " that clearly barred Boutilier as " a homosexual long before leaving Canada , " and authorized his deportation even if he had lived " a life of impeccable morality " in the U.S. Ruled Kaufman : " It is not our function to sit in judgment on Congress ' wisdom in enacting the law . " In dissent , Judge Leonard P. Moore called " psychopathic personality " an unconstitutionally vague term that immigration officials blindly applied to Boutilier without even giving him a medical examination . <P> Kaufman 's opinion is in direct conflict with two decisions by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco , which has ruled that section of the immigration law " void for vagueness " in its application to homosexuals . Since the Supreme Court generally agrees to referee circuit conflicts , it may now take its own reading of the elusive euphemism .                @ @ @ @ @
