txt On a hot , dry morning last summer , a tank truck drove up to the Indian Bend Irrigation Canal in the desert near here and , while a small group of men looked on , began dumping into the water 4,500 gallons of a slimy goo with a consistency much like mayonnaise . As curious as this operation seemed , it had a simple explanation . The men were irrigation engineers from the U.S Bureau of Reclamation and the mud-like material was a new chemical which the engineers hope will prove helpful in preserving water supplies by sealing the leaky bottoms of canals , ponds and reservoirs , thus reducing seepage . If current experiments by the Government agency turn out successfully , the new chemical stands to win wide usage , especially here in the West where writer shortscrg vomptImpa arr. particularly severe . In such arid lands as Mexico . Syria and Pakistan , the chemical could be of far-reaching economic significance . The compound is known as SS-13 . It is made by the Brown Mud Co. of Torrance , Calif . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the next two years , officials already are enthusiastic . A. B. West , acting director of the bureau 's Southwestern office , says he believes SS-13 has " definite promise " of substantially reducing water losses . Seepage Reduction The bureau estimates that up to 50% , of water diverted to irrigate crops is absorbed by the earthen sides and bottoms of canals and reservoirs before it ever reaches farmers ' fields . In the case of the Indian Bend Canal , a two-mile stretch used in the experiments with SS-13 , it was losing 950,000 gallons of water a day before the chemical was added some three months ago . Now , after three months of testing , Government engineers report seepage losses have been cut to 380,000 gallons a day . The 570,000 gallons saved is enough to irrigate five acres of alfalfa . Farmers and irrigation officials long have been anxious to solve the seepage problem , but combating it has proven an expensive undertaking up to now . Lining a canal , for instance , with concrete  --  the usual method  --  costs $3 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in SS-13 , including the outlay for the chemical , is 15 cents a square yard . It has not been determined how often , if ever , the chemical has to be re-applied . SS-13 was developed three years ago by George Brown and Harlan Glen , two chemists who formed the Brown Mud Co. in 1948 . SS-13 is described by its inventors as " a mixture of resinous polymers and heavy atoms in a carrier of common diesel fuel . " They decline to give further details of the formula . How It Works They do say , however , that SS-13 does its job by increasing the attraction of soil particles for water , thereby enlarging the droplets of water that surround each particle . The space between soil particles consequently is reduced and water has a more difficult time seeping through because . ironically , of the water droplets blocking the way . Water treated with SS-13 can be drunk without danger , according to Bureau of Reclamation scientists . And a study by Dr. William Thompson , Arizona 's chief veterinarian , indicates that cows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal quality , with no ill effects . SS-13 will get a big sales push if Reclamation Bureau aproves it . Aside from the psychological boost of such an endorsement , most irrigation districts count on the bureau to lend them money for canal construction and improvement . Bureau engineers must approve all phases of a project before the district can collect . Nevertheless , the Brown Mud Co. already claims a long list of customers . A road-building concern , Haumount Construction Co. of Phoenix , pours SS-13 into every pond it digs to store water for wetting clown roads during construction . A farmer in California 's Sacramento Valley uses SS-13 to prevent the water in his private reservoir from seeping through the ground and flooding lower adjacent farm land . And Dean Anderson , owner of an artificial water-skiing lake near San Bernardino , Calif. , reports he was losing 1,000 gallons of water a minute until he added the chemical last spring . SS-13 has reduced his losses by 80% , he estimates .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
