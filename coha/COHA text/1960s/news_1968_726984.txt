txt Is Congress getting ready to pass the tax bill after all ? Signs were increasing this week that resistance to the President 's proposal for a 10 percent income-tax surcharge may be melting . Congress may be forced to vote the election-year tax hike it intensely dislikes . Certainly a sizable escalation of the Vietnam war effort would give it no choice . As the debate raged in the administration over whether to escalate , Secretary of the Treasury Henry H. Fowler for the first time clearly labeled the tax proposal a Vietnam war tax  --  a tag the administration has not used until now to avoid making a vote on the tax a referendum on the war . " We can not mistake the connection between the tax-increase proposals and the costs of our efforts in Vietnam , " he told the Senate Finance Committee . " It is not the rise in regular budget outlays that requires a tax increase but the cost of Vietnam . " Sen. George A , Smathers ( D ) of Florida promptly applauded billing the tax hike as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress // measure . It would make it easier for Congress to go along , he said . Senator Smathers and Sen. Clinton P. Anderson ( D ) of New Mexico suggested the Senate bypass the obstinate House Ways and Means Committee and attach an income-tax hike onto a bill already passed by the House extending $4.2 billion worth of excise taxes . Such a move would anger the ways and means chairman , Wilbur D. Mills ( D ) of Arkansas , who zealously guards his committee 's right to initiate tax legislation . But he also would be on the spot if the Senate expresssed the opinion that a tax hike is necessary to prevent economic chaos . There already are signs , in fact , that Mr. Mills is bending . He appeared to acknowledge in a speech that sharply higher war spending , inflation , or the run on gold , could force Congress to vote taxes even without winning the substantial cuts in nondefense spending he has insisted on . Issues outlined The pressures Congress is facing  --  pressures which could be eased by a tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it that the military has asked for some 200,000 more ' men . Budget Director Charles J. Zwick says an increase of 100,000 to 200,000 men would cost an extra $2 billion to $4 billion . Even without such extra spending , the fiscal 1969 budget calls for $26 billion in Vietnam spending and a budget deficit that would run $21 billion , in the absence of a tax rise . The proposed tax hike would bring in about $16 billion during the rest of this fiscal year and next , substantially paring the deficit . ? Gold drain . Speculation is rampant in Europe that the United States will be forced to raise the price of gold . Even a pledge by the central banks that supply gold to the London pool to maintain the price at $35 an ounce has not stopped speculators from cashing in their dollars . Europe concerned One of the factors feeding speculation is the concern in Europe that the United States will not take the hard steps necessary to correct the balance-of-payments deficit and dampen inflation  --  particularly ' - a tax hike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jr. , briefed Senate . Republicans on the gold crisis , Sen. Everett McKinley Dirksen ( R ) of Illinois commented : " You could n't have heard what we heard without concluding we 're in a real bad fix . " In New York an advisory committee to the Treasury , including such luminaries as Chase Manhattan Bank president David Rockefeller and former Secretary of the Treasury C. Douglas Dillon , issued a statement saying failure to act on taxes would " endanger worldwide confidence in the dollar and invite a repetition of flareups in'the gold markets . " ? Inflation . During the last half of 1967 the general price level rose at an annual rate of 3.8 percent , and the President 's advisers see nearly that steep a climb for 1968 . Dispute over just how serious inflation is at the moment , however , has been one of the factors militating against a tax hike . " You get six economists agreeing and six economists disagreeing , " comments Senator Smathers . If the Senate seriously takes up a move to bypass Mr. Mills 's committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the excise renewal probably would not get to the President for signature by April 1  --  the date these taxes expire . But Mr. Fowler does not appear too concerned about that prospect . He wants the tax bill passed ? by whatever means Congress chooses ? and appears willing to accept any brief loss in excise revenues .
