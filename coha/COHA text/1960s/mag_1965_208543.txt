In the fantasies of science fiction , contraterrene , or CT , is something that strikes fear into the hearts of earthlings . CT is antimatter , which forms the substance of mysterious antiworlds where everything is the mirror image of its counterpart on earth . On some as yet undiscovered planet there might be antipeople who put freeze in their anti-cars , eat pasto for an anti-appetizer , take a dote to counteract antipoison or a biotic against anti-disease or a histamine for an anticold , who join the Defamation League and who put macassars on their anti-sofas . But antimatter is no joke . What is really fearful about it all is that contact of matter with its antimatter counterpart produces an explosive reaction that annihilates both . <P> Serious scientists have speculated a good deal about antimatter . They have already proved the existence of **27;14977;TOOLONG , anti-neutrons , positrons ( anti-electrons ) - but are there also complex forms of antimatter ? physicists have seriously doubted it . They did not have proof that particles of antimatter could be bound into anything as large as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together earthly atoms . <P> 33 Billion Volts . Last week a team of Columbia University researchers dispelled the doubts . In the Physical Review Letters , the Columbia scientists reported that they have produced the first complex nucleus of antimatter ever observed-the anti-deuteron . It is the antimatter counterpart to the nucleus of deuterium ( heavy hydrogen ) , consists of an antiproton and antineutron bound by a strong nuclear force , and has a negative charge . Such an achievement , the Columbia researchers conclude , provides strong evidence to support theories about the existence of an antiworld of stars , planets , and possibly even antipeople . <P> To detect the existence of the anti-deuteron , Dr. Leon M. Lederman and his group worked with a device called a mass spectrometer at Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island . Using Brookhaven 's 33 billion electron volt synchrotron , they bombarded a target of beryllium with a beam of high-energy protons . This resulted in a debris of . particles that sped through the 300-ft. magnetic field of the spectrometer , where they could be sorted and analyzed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positively charged particles , the apparatus made careful readings of the flight path , momentum and velocity of these particles . Computers showed where there was a mass peak of deuterons . Then , by reversing the field , the scientists ran the same tests to detect negatively charged particles . Since antiparticles behave the same way as their ordinary counterparts , the scientists concluded that they had found the anti-deuterons when the spectrometer showed a peak of activity where the deuteron had appeared earlier .
