CHARLOTTE BRONTE : THE EVOLUTION OF GENIUS by Winifred Gerin. 617 pages . Oxford . $8 . <P> <P> Art is often the artist 's escape . Such was the case of Charlotte Bronte , the most prolific of the Bront sisters , who flowered briefly in England during the 1840s with strange , powerful novels and poetry . Charlotte was shy and ugly , proud and ambitious . Her three novels , Jane Eyre , Shirley and Villette , are all switches on the old Cinderella theme : the rejected girl is not only poor but plain ; her Byronic hero must see not only through the rags but also through the flesh itself to her spiritual beauty . <P> That Charlotte tried to escape in her writing is well documented in this painstaking biography . British Scholar Winifred Gerin has already written biographies of Anne Bront and ne'er-do-well brother Branwell . A decade ago , she moved to the Bronts ' native vil lage of Haworth , the better to hear the moaning of the Yorkshire moors that the girls loved . She has read 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources of Charlotte 's erudition and deciphered trunkfuls of childish scrawl to interpret her juvenilia .

Brother Branwell , whom she envisaged as a writer of genius , was hopelessly addicted to drugs and alcohol . But Emily and Anne were busily writing poems and novels . Charlotte not only joined them but also took over as their agent ; within two years , she had engineered the publication of a joint collection of poems and three novels : Wuthering Heights , by Ellis Bell ( Emily ) , Agnes Grey , by Acton Bell ( Anne ) and Jane Eyre , by Currer Bell ( Charlotte ) . The poems and the first two novels flopped ; Jane Eyre was an immediate bestseller . <P> Later Balm . Reviewers were ecstatic .
