Since its debut during the newspaper strike of 1963 , The New York Review of Books has depended chiefly on two artists-David Levine and J. J. <P> Grandville-to illustrate its long-winding reviews and political commentaries . Both often seem more trenchant than the text they accompany , and for Levine this has led to many an outside commission , including covers for TIME , Newsweek and New York . But his col league Grandville is a special case . He has been dead for over a hundred years . And besides , he was a Frenchman . <P> Grandville 's caricatures , nonetheless , seem as pointed and contemporary as Levine 's at their best . For a review about the cult of beauty in art , Grandville contributed a cartoon of a male au dience-literally all eyes-ogling a beauteous young thing in the front row of the grand tier . A review on Polish philosophy featured a huge bellows all but blowing people off the street with an endless stream of wind . For two books about Republicanism , there was a stout , complacent elephant in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Motel Incident produced a long-beaked crane in judicial robes that was as bitterly mocking an image as any that Hersey could hope to evoke . <P> How did the Review come upon this incisive but altogether forgotten Frenchman ? Pretty much by happenstance , says Editor Barbara Epstein . Painter Leonid Berman , an old friend who has a cherished collection of Grandville 's il lustrated books ( all now collector 's items ) , proposed Grandville . Delighted with Grandville 's rangy repertoire , Editor Epstein has published his drawings in nearly every issue since . <P> Lexicon of Symbols . Grandville was born Jean Ignace Isidore Gerard in Nancy in 1803 , the son of a miniaturist and the grandson of a famed <P> French comedian . He inherited both these artistic strains ; when father painted portraits , son slyly drew caricatures of his unsuspecting sitters . Off to Paris at 20 , Gerard , who by now had adopted the name of Grandville , was soon invited to contribute to a new satirical magazine . By the time his book Metamorphoses of the Day was published in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " brightened many a little room in the Pays Latin , " and his studio had become a gathering place where Dumas , Balzac and Daumier gathered to talk and drink , while Grandville idly sketched caricatures as the conversation went on . <P> With success , Grandville 's pen grew ever more pointed . Relying on a lexicon of readily recognizable symbols ( scissors for censorship , sugarloaves for graft , a pear for King Louis Philippe 's heavy-jowled face ) , he fought for a variety of political causes , including a free press . In addition he illustrated La Fontaine 's Fables , Gulliver 's Travels and Robinson Crusoe , all the time building a memorable cast of hybrid creatures , half human , half animal . <P> Unattached Eyeballs . Grandville 's favorite creatures were frogs , which he used to symbolize children , clowns , or murder victims , and he kept a pet frog on his drawing table . Insects , too , fascinated him . With his thin spidery line , he created a whole metaphorical insectarium-emperor moths confer with dung beetles , frivolous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play to snails and turtles .
