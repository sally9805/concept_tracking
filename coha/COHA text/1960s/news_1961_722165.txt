txt The Pentagon has revived plans to cut the size of the Army National Guard and Army Reserve . At one time these plans called for eliminating eight of the twenty-seven National Guard divisions and ten Army Reserve divisions . The extent of the reductions now being considered has not been finally decided . But it has been made known that the Pentagon has all but abandoned ( plans to place increased reliance ! upon the reserve forces for emergency use . The change in the attitude toward the use of reserves in emergency mobilization has been prompted by experience with the current build-up , Pentagon sources said . Final judgments have - not been made , it was said . The recommendations of Maj. ? Gen. James A. Van Fleet , special consultant on reserve training , are being eagerly awaited . But the first indications are that reserves can not be counted upon for possible combat use as speedily as had been hoped . It was recalled that President Dwight D. , Eisenhower - sought for many years to reduc'e the Size of the National - Guard and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserve forces , President Eisenhower said in his final budget message last January : " The excess strengths which have beewprovided by the Congress above my recommendations in the last several years are unnecessarily costing the American people over $80,000 , - 000 annually and have been too long based on other than strictly military needs . " In recent years , Congress has insisted upon providing money to maintain the Army National Guard at 400,000 officers and men and the Army Reserve at 300,000 officers and men , with specific provisions in the legis-1 lation that these strengths must be maintained . Thus , the Presi-I dent has not had the alternative of refusing to spend the money , an alternative that he is given in the case of some weapons appropriations . President Eisenhower sought to cut the Army National Guard to . 360,000 men , and the Army Reserve to , 270,000 . When President Kennedy came into office , his Administration at first subscribed to the cuts .

Any effort to reduce the National Guard is bound to mean political trouble , officials recognized . This reserve force is regarded as one of the most politically protected organizations in the country . National Guard units are under the executive authority of the Governors while in reserve status . The law provides that " no unit of the National Guard * * * shall be withdrawn from any community or area * ? * until the Governor * " shall have been consulted and shall have consented . " Secretary of Defense Robert S. is understood to have won sympathy at first from National Guard leaders for a plan to reduce the total size of the National Guard but- to provide it with better equipment and mobilization plans . Subsequently , it is believed , political opposition grew and the plan for curtailment was abandoned . The Administration then adopted a scheme that would have placed greater reliance upon the reserves . According to this scheme , a force of 89,000 National Guardsmen , with two combat divisions and support units , would have been readied for combat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight more divisions would have been kept in such a state of training that they could be deployed in eight weeks . Experience in the recent callup has indicated that these plans may not be realistic , Pentagon sources said . General Van Fleet , who is studying the reserve mobilization , particularly with respect to training . will have an important voice in the final determination . of policy , it was said . At the same time , officials stressed that recent complaints about the efficiency of the mobilization were not a factor in the change in attitude . The Pentagon regards the complaints as normal . It regards the intrusion of various political aspects , such as the prominence of members of Congress in relay-1 ing these complaints , as secondary to the specific question of military efficiency . In this connection , high officers regarded as significant the Pentagon decision to add two divisions to the Regular Army , for a total of sixteen . The two additional Regular Army divisions will more than make up for the possible losses in military strength in depth that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the situation in the Army , Air Force officials were pleased with the performance of reserve air units in the mobilization . Some Air Force officials are thinking that a cutback in the size of the Regular Air Force may ultimately be possible , if the reserve units continue to respond as efficiently as they have in the current crisis .
