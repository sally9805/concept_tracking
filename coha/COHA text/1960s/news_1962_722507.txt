txt In the last five of his eight years as auditor of the Northwest National Bank of Chicago at 3985 Milwaukee ay. , Glenn W. Glaser devised some inusual methods of determining whose hand was in the till . For instance , he thought it would be clever to slip into a teller 's cage and slyly place an extra $10 bill in the cash drawer . If the teller was honest , at the end of the day he would report he had $10 more than he could account for . Trap Does n't Rork But , this did n't trap anyone in any dishonest acts , so Glaser , who is 52 and lives at 104 Lee st. , Prospect Heights , had to think of something else . So he reversed the procedure . Instead of slipping $10 into the till , he 'd slip $10 out . It worked . Several tellers were dismissed because of shortages in their cash accounts . The only trouble was ( hat the money involved in the shortages found its way into Glaser 's pocket  --  to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said yesterday in federal District court . Firings Under a Cloud " He got away with $8,000 while all these tellers were being dismissed , with their futures under a cloud , " Smith told Judge James B. Parsons . Altho Glaser allegedly took $8,000 , he was indicted by the federal grand jury last week for embezzlement of $330.87 . Smith said that the government has documentary evidence to prove embezzlement of this amount . However , he said , Glaser told Federal Bureau of Investigation agents , when first questioned , that he had taken $3,500 . Later he raised this figure to $5,000 , and the FBI agents discovered another $3,000 discrepancy that Glaser had not told them about . Bond Is Raised Smith recited the story when he appeared before Judge Parsons to oppose reduction of the $1,000 bond for Glaser on the indictment . Informed of the amount actually involved in the embezzlement case rather than the amount stated in the indictment , Judge Parsons raised Glaser 's bond to $5,000 , then released him tin his own recognizance.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
