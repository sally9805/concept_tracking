Crisis . Urgent . Desperate . <P> THESE terms dominated the conversation of ten big-city mayors after they met with Richard Nixon last week . The urban condition is all that they say it is , and their conference with the President left them little hope for dramatic new federal action very soon . <P> Nixon will not be easily budged from the premise that expensive , far-reaching social welfare efforts are futile if the war continues indefinitely or if the economy goes sour . Nor is Congress in the mood for grandiose programs right now . Viet Nam and inflation , together with crime and unrest , remain the President 's first orders of business . As he told a G.O.P. women 's conference : " I ask the women in this audience to hold me and all of my Cabinet colleagues responsible on those three great issues . I will make this promise : next year I will be able to report that we have made real progress toward bringing peace in the world , re-establishing law and order at home , and also in stopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal . We are not overpromising . " <P> Helping Nonsupporiers . This tone of quiet confidence has been a constant in Nixon 's makeup lately . His Gallup and Harris readings indicate that he is more popular now than last November , despite the war , despite campus turmoil , despite spurting prices . Even Rex Tugwell , a charter member of the New Deal , conjectured last week that if the election were held today , Nixon would get 10,000,000 more votes than he did in the fall . <P> Operating from this strength , Nixon has begun , however cautiously , to risk offending some of those who elected him . Negroes are still suspicious , but many Southern whites who voted Republican in November are unhappy about the Administration 's school-integration policy . Last week Nixon went against the advice of some senior aides in recommending repeal of the 7% business-investment tax credit as part of his tax package ( see BUSINESS ) . Repeal of the credit is primarily an anti-inflationary measure , but the predominantly Republican business community will pay the bill . The President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halving the surcharge , which weighs most heavily on those of modest means , shrinking loopholes used mainly by the affluent-also tend to benefit Nixon 's nonsupporters more than those who elected him . <P> Congress , led by House Ways and Means Chairman Wilbur Mills , is likely to demand far more extensive tax reforms than those that the Administration is proposing . Whatever the outcome , both parties will doubtless take credit for redressing longstanding inequities . A President dealing with a Congress controlled by the opposition can hardly hope for much more . Last week , however , the Administration won a minor but perhaps trend-setting victory when enough Democrats deserted their party leadership to vote with the Republicans on an education assistance measure .
