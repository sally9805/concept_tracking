But General Motors President John F. Gordon grumbled last week that " amateur engineers " are trying to impose federal regulation of safety design that is just about as realistic . <P> " To begin with , " said Gordon , addressing a meeting of the National Safety Congress in Chicago , " it is completely unrealistic even to talk about a foolproof and crashproof car . An automobile must still be something that people will want to buy and use . Safety , in any environment from a bathtub to a bomb shelter , is a relative term , not an absolute . In the case of the automobile , we can only design into it the greatest degree of safety that is consistent with other essential functional characteristics . Beyond that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " radical and ill-conceived " safety ideas include the thought that " we abandon hope of teaching drivers to avoid traffic accidents and concentrate on designing cars that will make collisions harmless . " This , he said , " is a little like suggesting that we neglect good health habits in favor of reliance on miracle drugs-and on some method of compelling people to take them . "
