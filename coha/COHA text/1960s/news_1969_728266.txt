txt State Attorney General Arthur J. Sills said tonight that he would decide whether to invoke a state law under which Mayor Hugh S. Addonizio could be removed from office for his ' refusal to answer questions of a Federal grand jury on the ground that his answers might incriminate him . The law provides also for the ouster of a public official who refuses to waive immunity . Mayor Addonizio has refused to waive immunity before the Federal grand jury that is investigating alleged corruption in the municipal government here . Mr. Sills discussed such a possible course of action a few hours after Mayor Addonizio had told Federal Judge Robert Shaw in open court here that he knew Anthony ( Tony Boy ) Boiardo , a reputed Mafioso , and that he believed that such a statement might tend to incriminate him . Explanation to Court The 55-year-old Mayor of New Jersey 's largest city had let the remark escape while exIplaining to the court why he had invoked the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination lin refusing to answer a grand jury question . Boiardo , listed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mafia " family " of Gerardo ( Jerry ) Catena , is a salesman for the Valentine Electric Company , which has received city contracts . Mr. Sills , in an interview , cautioned against speculating whether he would actually initiate action under the law that holds that any public officer refusing to testify before a grand jury on grounds of selfincrimination " shall be removed " from office . The law provides that any citizen may file a complaint seeking removal of a public official in such circumstances . The State Attorney General // he would discuss the matter with United States Attorney Frederick B. Lacey , who is directing the grand jury investigation , and with Essex County Prosecutor Joseph P. Lordi , 1 who turned over to Mr. Lacey today all the information gathered in the last 18 months by an Essex County grand jury . Mr. Sills said he would do nothing that might jeopardize the continuing Federal investigation . Mr. Sills said also there was some question about the constitutionality of the removal law , known as the Faulkner Act . Under this act , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to testify before grand juries .. Since all nine members of the Newark City Council have also been subpoenaed as witnesses in the Federal investigation , state officials expressed the opinion that it was unlikely that the Newark City Council would take such action . The United States Supreme Court in 1967 reversed the conviction of several Camden policemen who asserted that the state 's removal law had coerced them , with the threat of loss of their jobs , into incriminating themselves . Although reversing the convictions , the Supreme Court did not strike down the law itself . Consequently , some legal sources contend that the act 's removal powers remain effective . Mayor Addonizio 's appearance before Judge Shaw for the second time in two days was on the question whether his fear of self-incrimination if he answered the grand jury 's questions was valid or fanciful . Judge Shaw said that Mr. Addonizio and his lawyer , Bernard Hellring , had failed so far to convince him that the Mayor would be incriminating himself by answering the questions already asked by the grand jury . Unless there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness could not invoke the Fifth Amendment against answering , the judge contended . " We do n't have guilt by association in the United States , " Judge Shaw declared . Mr. Hellring had argued that rulings of the United States Supreme Court gave a witness the , right to decide whether his answer to a question would incriminate him . Judge Shaw and Mr. Hellring expounded differing interpretations of Supreme Court precedents . Two more witnesses balked today at answering questions in the grand jury room . They were Municipal Court Judge James Del Mauro and Joseph Biancone , an executive in the Valentine Electric Company , both of whom invoked the privilege against self-incrimination . Judge Del Mauro , who had announced on Dec. 1 that he was resigning his $20,000 post as of Jan. 1 , invoked the Fifth ' Amendment when he was in- , formed that the grand jury was investigating his income tax returns from 1966 through 1968.1 Mr. Biancone invoked the Fifth Amendment 11 times in refusing to answer questions , ' some of which sought to learn what if any connections he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application to direct both witnesses to answer . In another development , the city 's Corporation Counsel , Philip E. Gordon , who had testified briefly yesterday behind closed doors , resigned his $23 , - 000 post today . Mayor Addonizio announced he had accepted Mr. Gordon 's resignation , which , he said , had been given orally . The Mayor said he was awaiting a formal letter from Mr. Gordon . Meanwhile , he refused to say more . Mr. Gordon could not be reached for comment . A spokesman for Mr. Addonizio , in disclosing Mr , Gordon 's resignation , said : " The , Mayor can foresee no circum stances under which Mr. Gor don , will be in his office tomorrow . " Mr. Gordon , who was appointed Newark 's . Corporation Counsel by the Mayor in April 1968 , had previously been a Councilman representing the East Ward . He is 51 years old . Lordi Aids Inquiry Mr. Lordi and Mr. Lacy announced , at a joint news conference , that the Essex County grand jury that had been investigating alleged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would become inactive while the Federal panel made use of its material . As part of the coordinated effort  --  which Mr. Lacey hailed as the first in the nation to his knowledge of such co- ' operation between local and Federal agencies  --  two of Mr. Lordi 's best aides , Assistant Prosecutors Michael F. Riccardelli and Donald W. Merkel-I bach , will be given leaves of ' absence to work for the De- , partment of Justice on assign- ' , ment with Mr. Lacey . The arrangements for the turning over of the Essex grand jury 's investigation to the Department of Justice were made at meetings in Washing1ton last week among Assistant Attorney General Will R. Wilson , Attorney General John A. Mitchell , Mr. Lacey , and Mr. Lordi 's chief aides . Mr. Lacey said he expected " very dramatic results " from the merged effort in the near future . Mayor Addonizio and several other Newark officials were among the 280 witnesses who have been questioned by the Essex grand jury . Mr. Lacey said the 5,165 pages of testimony and voluminous documents would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result in savings of money and manpower that could be used to press further the drive against organized crime and corruption . The investigations by the Essex grand jury resulted so far in one indictment , that of Dominick A. Spina , Newark Director of Police , on charges of willful failure to enforce anti-gambling laws . Mr. Spina was acquitted of that charge on Nov. 7 , 1968 , in a verdict directed by Superior Court Judge Samuel A. Lamer . Today 's hearing before Judge Shaw was on an application by Assistant United States Attorney Herbert J. Stern that Mr. Addonizio be directed to answer the questions . Judge Shaw had studied overnight the contents of two sheets of paper on which Mayor Addonizio had written his reasons why he believed he might incriminate himself by answering each of eight questions selected from the many at which he had , balked yesterday . Handing the papers back to Mr. Hellring , Judge Shaw said that he was not impressed by the answers , but that he would permit Mr. Addonizio to state his reasons in open court if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer to a specific question were not in itself incriminating it might become " a link in a chain of evidence " that might subsequently be developed and which could incriminate the witness . The judge did not accept that argument , and Mr. Addonizio said : " Your honor , I 'd like to be sworn in . " With Mr. Addonizio in the witness chair , the court stenographer read back the question : " Do you know a man personally , known as Anthony Boiardo , also as Tony Boy Boiardo ? " " I do know him and my anIswer may tend to incriminate me , " was the reply that evoked surprise among some spectators . " Well , I guess that disposes of that one , " remarked the robed judge drily , indicating that Mr. Addonizio had answered the question he had contended he should not be compelled to answer . The Mayor left the stand abruptly without attempting to give his reasons for not waiting to answer the other questions . " If I were to rule now , " declared the judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) go back to the grand room and answer the question . But I will proceed with deliberate caution . If there has been a crime and there is a conviction , I do n't want it reversed because of a claim that the defendant 's constitutional privilege has been violated . " Judge Shaw said it was his " inclination to order disclosure on matters of official conduct , particularly where a public official is involved . " Judge Shaw ordered Mr. Addonizio to return to court on the day the grand jury resumed its questioning of witnesses . He said he would study the transcript of the questioning of all witnesses to date to get a fuller understanding of the nature and trend of the investigation . He will make his ruling then . Mr. Stern , who said he expected the next session of the grand jury to be on Tuesday , said the Federal investigation of municipal conduct here involved possible violations of the Hobbs Act and the Travel Act , Federal statutes involving extortion and bribery in cases where interstate travel or companies doing interstate business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T. Cahill , speaking at a $25-a-plate victory breakfast in Pennsauken , told 400 people today that his campaign statements on organized crime had been too mild .
