Which actor had the piano player 's role in Casablanca ? <P> If Dooley Wilson is your answer , you are In at Harvard , at least with the undergraduates . Humphrey Bogart is their newest major . At the Brattle Theater last week , after 15,000 viewers had seen 47 showings of 14 Bogey movies , the tenth Humphrey Bogart Festival ended . Harvard 's Bogey men knew their subject so well that they could tell within weeks when any picture of their hero had been taken . The yardstick is his receding hairline . <P> Essence of Cool . Bogart 's side-o-mouth repartee has become the canon vernacular of Harvard Yard , and anyone who does n't dig it is digging his social grave . Harvard boys , ordering another round of drinks , rasp : " Play it again , Sam . " Raising their glasses , they say : " Here 's looking at ya , kid ! " And when they 're getting ready to blow the joint , they ask : " Ya ready , Slim ? " When they want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have to show you no stinking badge . " That line is so popular that one group pledged to write it into examination essays , and professors were soon reading about the " stinking badge " in papers on the French Revolution . <P> When Bogart lights a cigarette on the screen , girls respond with big , sexy sighs .

" There 's something just so heroic about going to see something anti-intellectual the night before an exam , " she explains . " Like imitating Bogart 's I-don't-give-a-damn attitude . " <P> Very few Harvard boys or Radcliffe girls have pictures of Bogart in their rooms because that sort of thing is looked down upon as " too Big Tenish . " They will never forgive John Huston for making Bogey a boozy simpleton in The African Queen . They do n't like The Caine Mutiny either : " Queeg is not good Bogey . " Key Largo is very good Bogey .
