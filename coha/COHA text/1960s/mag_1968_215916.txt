For one of the three men who fought for life last week with transplanted hearts , the battle was brief . <P> Louis Block , 58 , a retired fireman , had suffered a succession of heart attacks while he ran a radio-TV business in The Bronx . His heart grew bigger but weaker , causing a corresponding lung deterioration . Block was referred to Brooklyn 's Maimonides Medical Center , where Surgeon Adrian Kantrowitz had already attempted the transplant of a baby 's heart ( TIME , Dec. 15 ) . <P> The Kantrowitz team was prepared for delay in finding a donor with Block 's blood type , AB , Rh positive . This is found in only about 5% of Americans . By extraordinary chance , the first potential donor reported to Maimonides was AB positive . She was Helen Krouch , 29 , a New Jersey office worker who had seemed in perfect health when she told her parents : " If I could save someone 's life with my heart , I would do it . If I knew I were going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Instead , she collapsed in a parking lot from the pressure of a tumor upon her brain stem and lapsed into a fatal coma . But her father remembered , and her doctor called Maimonides , where she died . <P> Helen Krouch weighed a scant 100 Ibs. , and her heart was proportionately small . Louis Block weighed 170 . Besides the difficulty of tailoring the transplant to fit , Surgeon Kantrowitz saw another problem : the donor heart almost certainly could not pump enough blood at first , although it might later increase its capacity . He decided to transplant the heart but to assist it for a while with a helium balloon pump inserted through a thigh artery and placed in Block 's aorta . This device ( TIME , Aug. 25 ) has worked well for five patients in shock and near death after heart attacks . <P> The operation took more than eight hours-longest of the five heart transplants so far performed . When it was over , the exhausted Kantrowitz said realistically : " I do n't think any heart transplant can be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours later , Block died .
