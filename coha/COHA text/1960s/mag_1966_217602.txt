When the two artists arrived at West Berlin 's Borsig machine-tool factory to use the company 's huge cutting and welding facilities , they were met with scorn . " We start work at 6:45 a.m. , " the factory hands pointedly declared , fully expecting them to saunter in each day at noon . But German Sculptress Brigitte Meier-Denninghoff and her husband , Martin Matschinsky , are made of sterner stuff . Up each day at 5 o'clock , they continued working long after everyone else had gone home . Six months later , the commission-a 16-ft. stainless-steel sculpture-was completed . The workers gave the artists their highest accolade , offered to take them on as professional welders . <P> Basic Grammar . Today the sculpture they welded at the Borsig factory stands outside West Berlin 's Free University , a soaring monument to the country 's postwar technological strides . Similar commissions by the pair , along with a large exhibition currently traveling throughout West Germany , reveal a technical facility in touch with the times . Most of the acclaim goes to Brigitte Meier-Denninghoff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her collaborator husband does not mind his relative oblivion . A former actor , he figures that she was already well on her way before they became a team in 1955 . " We 'd like to change the use of my maiden name , " Brigitte confesses , " but it 's probably too late for that . " <P> Brigitte had struggled long to reach the top , in her early student days was even expelled from a Munich art school for lack of talent . Fortunately , British Sculptor Henry Moore saw at least a spark , in 1947 admitted her to his studio for study . " I executed a madonna in stone for him , and every minute was wonderful , " she recalls . After learning sculpture 's basic grammar from Moore , Brigitte was ready to leave traditional materials behind , sought out the Russian-born constructivist Antoine Pevsner in Paris , put in another year of apprenticeship with him . <P> Oblique Allusions . Independent and stubborn , Brigitte was soon steering her own course , combining something of the totemic power of Moore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received Paris ' coveted Prix Bour-delle from a jury that included Giacometti , Arp , Lipchitz and Moore , went on to represent Germany at the 1962 Venice Biennale . <P> Today she and her husband have a well-equipped machine shop of their own in Paris where they arc-weld great quantities of stainless steel and brass tubing into abstract sculptures that exude a confidence in the mechanical world and at the same time , from certain oblique angles , suddenly open up all manner of allusions to nature . With success , their concepts and commissions have grown steadily bigger . " Using our welding technique , " says Brigitte , " there is no limit . " For Germany 's Tubingen University , they are now putting the finishing touches on a 49-ft. - long commission , their largest to date . Says Martin : " We want people to be able to enjoy our sculpture-not with their eyes alone , but to be able to walk through them , and feel an enveloping physical experience .
