txt on education What 's ahead ... One of American higher education 's most changeless contours is about to change . Traditionally one liberal arts curriculum has been " right " for all students . Such old standards as freshman English , history of Western civilization , introduction to some science , art appreciation , and physical education were staples for all . First the younger professors challenged this , then students themselves did . Now even administrators question it . Change now hangs heavy in the air . Almost every college has a faculty committee grappling with curriculum reform . Probably none will have the same curriculum 10 years from now that it has today . Traditional curriculums will probably give way to a ' - wider mix of courses open to any student . And exams will displace some courses ? just to make sure students do n't graduate minus a broad base in the liberal arts . " What grade did you get in your English essay ? " asked Tommy Tomorrow . " I flunked , " said Freddie Future . " The computer told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers grade essay exams may someday dawn . Researchers at the University of Connecticut are hard at work on it . And the College Examination Board is pitching in with money . So far the Connecticut , team has turned a computer loose only on English essays  --  to grade writing quality . But they hope next to move into subject matter analysis  --  grading history essays , for instance . Despite the sturdy skepticism the idea promptly evokes , the Connecticut researchers think it can be done . . They have already graded a batch of 274 high school English essays . Four high school teachers graded them first . Then the computer graded them and gave out about the same results . Trends . American students more and more are taking a hand in campus decisionmaking . Up to now they have been rung in mostly , if at all , on matters of student life ? dormitory regulations , meals , clothes , rules , and the like , But they are suddenly having a say in such once forbidden decision realms as admissions and curriculum . Students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They rarely cast decisive votes , but they can speak out . Pomona College in California has long had joint faculty-student public events and admission committees . Students not only sit on them , but offer opinions which are listened to . This fall for the first time at Pomona , student representatives will sit on the curriculum committee . Yale is even granting students a voice in faculty tenure . These are heady new heights . And yet the students are reaching them . How and why .. . Nearly every state this fall and winter is caught ' up in various attitudes of reorganization , restudy , and reshuffile . This year 's bounty of new federal education legislation is to blame . The states must add to their staffs or shift them around to study and ponder proposals and otherwise get set to administer the bonanza . Some states are launching into sweeping statewide surveys at the same time . Texas , for instance , is charting a three-year , to to-bottom study of its public school system . Every state mounts such surveys now and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it every 10 years or 30 years . Others do it in chunks and pieces  --  higher education this year , secondary education next , and vocational education the year after that . The round of rhythmic change this year has the added syncopation of federal aid  --  fortissimo . As the new school year opened in Moscow , former Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev 's educational reform had its knuckles rapped . Ministers of education of national republics and provincial secretaries said curt things about poor student performance . Mr. Khrushchev 's educational reform of 1958 provided , that in the last three years in high school , Soviet students must spend one-third of their time at manual labor . His critics say this has eroded scholastic standards . Already the hours devoted to manual training have been pared from 12 to four . Mr. Khrushchev 's critics continue to favor so-called polytechnical education . But they do n't like having high school students actually work in factories or farms at the expense of their studies .               @ @ @ @ @ @
