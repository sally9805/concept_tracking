txt After months of secret correspondence , of polite hopes from both British and Rhodesian governments for an honorable settlement , and wildly optimistic rumors that a d ? tente was close , Britain has decided to put an end to a diplomatic guessing game . It now has doused all hopes for an immediate settlement in Rhodesia and banished possibility of one in the near future . At present there is no basis for a settle . ment , said Commonwealth Secretary George Thomson in a speech to Parliament in which he enumerated for the first time specific areas of disagreement between the two governments . Not slamming future door The statement stung Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith into accusing Britain of a breach of faith by announcing publicly points of difference regarded as confidential . In an exclusive interview , Mr. Thomson was asked if there were any flickers of hope for a settlement . Also what course Britain would now take in its discussions with Rhodesia . He replied : " I think it will be very difficult to overcome our differences . But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility of reaching a settlement . " Failing a reasonable prospect of such a settlement we are not interested in negotiating for negotiation 's sake , " he said . Two key changes sought Though Mr. Thomson has no intentions of slamming the door on a possible settlement he clearly is not very sanguine about reaching an acceptable rapprochement . His recent speech to Parliament explains why . It cited some of the changes Mr. Smith apparently wants in the " Tiger " constitution . ( Prime Minister Harold Wilson and Mr. Smith hammered out a compromise constitution on board the British cruiser Tiger in December , 1966 . Mr. Smith later rejected it . ) The main changes according to Mr. Thomson " are fundamentally incompatible with the essential principles agreed by both sides of the House . " One of the stipulations is that all African members of the Rhodesian Senate should // Keystone Thomson takes firm stand British Commonwealth Secretary George Thomson has doused all hope of a rapid settlement of the Rhodesian problem  --  and offended Rhodesian leader Ian Smith . *Rhodesian hopes dim for immediate accord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities . The objection to this proposal is that it would prevent African-elected representatives blocking attempts to weaken present antidiscrimination laws . Another change that Mr. Smith seeks is the abolition of the cross-voting embodied in Rhodesia 's 1961 Constitution . He would also like the number of B roll African seats to be less than was stipulated in the Tiger constitution . " These proposals , " Mr. Thomson declares , " would derogate from the third principle which calls for an immediate improvement in the political status of the African  --  and would also substantially delay progress toward majority rule . " Mr. Thompson recently visited Africa for " very frank discussions " with eight heads of Commonwealth governments . He also met , for the first time , the Governor of Rhodesia , Sir Humphrey Gibbs . Extra burden noted Seated in his vast , high-ceilinged Whitehall office , Mr. Thomson was asked what the impact would be on Britain 's relations with Africa , and on Africa itself , if Britain did not use force against Rhodesia and if sanctions did not bring the Smith government down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think , be wrong , " Mr. Thomson replied , " to predict the situation you have hypothesized . Force apart , we shall do our best , to see that this is not the out .... come . " Whatever happens in Rhodesia we will stand by our ptinciples , and it is this basic moral position that is of importance to having good relations with African countries . " Mr. Thomson refused to accept the belief that sanctions were not working or that they severely restricted the British economy . " Of course , sanctions impose some extra burden on the British economy , and this is particularly regrettable at the present time , but let us see things in proportion . " Our loss of trade with Rhodesia was only 0.6 of 1 percent of our total export trade , and indeed , about half of this loss was made up of increased exports to Malawi and Zambia . " To Mr. Thomson the idea that economic factors would force Britain to give up sanctions and reach a settlement with the Rhodesian Government on its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rhodesians realize this the better , " he said .
