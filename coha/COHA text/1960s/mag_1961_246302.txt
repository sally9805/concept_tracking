Architect Frank Lloyd Wright has been dead for two years , but monuments to his originality are still going up . Now another of his last major buildings-the Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation*at Wauwatosa ( outside Milwaukee ) - is all but finished , and sightseers as well as worshipers are crowding to see it . <P> To help him design his first and only Byzantine church , Wright got advice from his Greek Orthodox wife and pondered such examples as Istanbul 's Santa Sophia , with its 107-ft. - diameter dome set high on pendentives . But he decided that " it is never necessary to cling slavishly to tradition . " He used an equilateral Greek cross as a ground plan , with three arms containing seats and the fourth the altar . Over this , rather than the usual square design , he superimposed a circle to form the outer wall ; surmounting the wall came a dome 106 ft. in diameter . The stained-glass windows , still to be donated , will be fitted in just beneath the dome , to filter sunlight . Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the lower level . Since Wright 's concrete is painted egg-yellow , it is sometimes hard to tell where sun begins and building ends . The dome is gold inside , royal blue outside . <P> Like God . Greek Orthodox church authorities wondered whether tradition did not demand greater fidelity to existing Byzantine structures . Even Pastor Emmanuel N. Vergis was at first hesitant . His main problem was how to communicate with Wright : " How do you speak to a divinity ? I mean , I do that when I pray , but what about on earth ? That 's the way I felt about him . " Wright did not help matters with his opinion of Milwaukee itself : " It 's hardly worth blowing up . " <P> Once he had learned to distinguish between Wright and God , Pastor Vergis found the architect reassuring and even reverent . " Mr. Wright used to say , ' We 'll all be right here , in the palm of His hand , ' " recalled the pastor , cupping his hands as Wright had . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his cupped hands . Wright ringed the rim with a wide balcony to bring more worshipers closer to the altar . <P> Like an Oyster . The church cost $1,250.000 ( Wright 's fee : $137,500 ) . As with another latter-day Wright design , Manhattan 's Guggenheim Museum , criticisms are harsh . To some observers it suggests a stadium , to others a brooding oyster or a flying saucer . " I ca n't decide whether it looks like it just got here or like it 's just about to leave , " muttered one viewer . Another critic grumbles that it is " too small for a bullfight , too large for a cockfight . " <P> " It is warm and serene , " said Father Vergis , and many fellow citizens are sure it will make Milwaukee famous . <P> <P> *Wright designed at least four other sectarian churches in recent years : the Unitarian Meeting House at Madison , Wis. , a Congregational church at Redding , Calif. , Beth Sholom Synagogue at Elkins Park , Pa. , and a Christian Science church for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
