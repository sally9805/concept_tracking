txt If the current business expansion continues through next month , it will enter the record books as the longest boom In American history . Even the more pessimistic forecasters are convinced that the expansion will indeed set a record . The longest expansion until now has been the 80-month business boom that went on during most of World War II , ending in February 1945 . The current expansion , which began in February 1961 , is now entering its 80th month . Altogether , there have been 26 previous U.S. business expansions , according to records kept back to 1854 by the nonprofit National Bureau of Economic Research . The average length : A mere 30 months . The full dimensions of the current expansion can be gauged by reviewing some of the changes that have taken place in the U.S. economy since 1961 . The magnitude of these changes is impressive , as the following review shows . GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT : At more than $775 billion annually , the nation 's output of goods and services has risen some $255 billion since 1961 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations as the United Kingdom , West Germany and France . The table below translates America 's multibillion-dollar economic growth into percentage terms and also shows how rapidly the major components of the GNP total have risen during the great boom . Within the fast-expanding government category , the sharpest rise since 1961 hs. , - 07. - curred in Federal nonmilitary expenditures , which have soared 77% in the period . Federal outlays for defense have climbed 52% , and overall Federal expenditures are up 56% since 1961 . Spending by state and local governments has risen 70% ? much faster than total Federal outlays . Inflation ; of course , accounts for part of the GNP rise since 1961 . If " growth " stemming simply from higher prices is discounted , the " real " GNP increase since 1961 works out to 34% , rather than 49% . The consumer-spending category is by far the largest of the various GNP components . This spending breaks down three ways  --  for durable goods such as appliances and autos , for nondurables such as food and clothing and for services such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the three subcategories have fared since 1961 . Although spending for durables has risen fastest , the consumer still spends a good deal less for such products than for nondurables or services . Currently , consumers devote about 44% of their budgets to nondurables , 41% , to services and only 15% to durable goods . Overall , the statistical breakdown for consumer spending indicates that the economy has not become as " service oriented " as is often suggested . In 1961 , consumers spent about 40% of their budgets on services . The 47% rise in business spending , of course , has brought a big increase in the capacity of the country 's factories . U.S. plant capacity has grown by about a third since 1961 . This admittedly is less than the dollar rise in business spending , but the capacity rise is based on physical volume of goods and therefore is n't " inflated " by rising prices . As a result of the 33% capacity increase , U.S. manufacturers are able to produce a far greater volume of goods now than in 1961 without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , U S. factories are using about 85% of their capacity , on average , well below the 90% - plus operating rates at which severe strains traditionally begin to show up . At operating rates above 90% , overtime costs rise sharply , and many producers are forced to use inefficient facilities that would otherwise stand idle or be scrapped . PERSONAL INCOME : The rapidly rising earnings of most Americans have supplied much of the fuel for the economy 's long climb since 1961 . The personal income of Americans now exceeds $631 billion annually , some $215 billion more than the 1961 Lncome total . The rise reflects a variety of factors , not Just the steadily climbing wages and salaries of all sorts of workers . The table below lists the key income sources of Americans and shows how rapidly each category has risen since 1961 . As in the case of service spending noted above , the income record since 1961 holds some surprises . Landlords ' income from rent has risen only half as fast as overall income , a fact that should surprise many tenants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed much faster than income from wage and salary payments , a fact that may give some second thoughts to people who worry that labor is getting far more than its share of the income pie ; fringe benefits paid to workers , however , have risen much faster than wages and salaries . At present , dividend and interest payments make up about 11% of total personal income . This compares with only 9% in 1961 . Wage and salary payments make up 67% of the total , about equal to 1961 . The overall rise in consumer income is considerable even if rising prices and an increasing population are taken into account . After-tax per-capita income in the second quarter reached a record annual rate of $2,388 in terms of 1958 dollars . This was 25% higher than the comparable 1961 per-capita figure . In the view of many economists , this income measurement comes as close as anything to a " standard-ofliving " index for the U.S. Accompanying the big rise in consumer income has been a big rise in consumer savings . These savings have recently been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up 70% from the 1961 level ( a sharper rise than the 65% increase in consumer credit outstanding over the same period ) . Time deposits in commercial banks have attracted the largest share of these savings . The rise in consumer income reflects a massive improvement in the U.S. employment picture during the economic expansion . Many more jobs exist , workers toil longer hours and pay levels are considerably higher . Today , there are more than 76 million civilian jobs in the U.S. , up from less than 66 million in 1961 . The increase exceeds the population of New York , the nation 's largest city . The rise in jobs not only has opened up work for the country 's increasing population  --  there are 15 million more Americans now than in 1961  --  but has given work to millions who could n't get jobs early in the decade . Unemployment in the nation is below the 3 million mark ; in 1961 , it was close to 5 million . Employes generally work a longer week now than in 1961 . In manufacturing , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour longer than the 1961 workweek . In the construction trade , the average workweek has recently exceeded 38 hours , up from less than 37 in 1961 . An exception : Retailing , where the average has dropped from more than 38 hours in 1961 to less than 36 recently . Factors in the retailing trend , say analysts , include the increasing use of part-time employes and selfservice in stores . Most employes , moreover , are receiving much more pay per hour . The average hourly pay level in manufacturing is about $2.80 , up from $2.32 in 1961 . In construction , the average is nearly $4 10 an hour , some 90 cents higher than in 1961 In retailing , the average pay level is about $2 , up from $1.68 at the start of the expansion CORPORATE PROFITS : The climb of corporate profits during the long boom has been even more spectacular than the rise of consumer income . The before-tax earnings of U.S. companies currently total nearly $80 billion a year , up from $50 billion in 1961 . Within the broad corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different types of industries . The table below shows the overall profits rise , plus the gains for particular groups . In 1961 , the profits of durable-goods makers totaled some $500 million less than those of nondurable-goods producers . Currently , however , durables firms are earning some $3.3 billion a year more than nondurables companies . The big boom in auto-buying in recent years is a major factor in the profit rise for durables . It should be noted , however , that the durables group traditionally fares extra well in expansion periods and extra badly in recessions . The other categories listed above generally react less dramatically to changes in the overall course of business . A footnote to the profits story : Since 1961 , the after-tax earnings of corporations have climbed 71% , a considerably faster rise than the 57% gain in before-tax income . This , of course , reflects the 1964 income tax cut . To be sure , the economic record of the U.S. since 1961 is not without blemishes . Lagging Home Starts New-home starts last year totaled less than 1.2 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million units and far below the 1963 level of 1.6 million . In recent weeks , housing has shown some signs of a pickup , but the industry 's record still stands in bleak contrast to the general economic boom since 1961 . In part , the housing industry 's trouble reflects overbuilding at least of middle and upper-income housing in the earlier post-World War II years . The mortgage funds for home building have been relatively scarce at times during the boom . Ironically , if other segments of the economy had n't been so strong in recent years , there doubtless would have been more money available for home building , and the industry almost certainly would have fared better . The U.S. gold supply also has declined during the long expansion . The Government 's coffers now hold some $13 billion of gold , down from more than $17 billion at the beginning of the expansion . Technically , this drop has occurred because the U.S. has been spending more dollars abroad than it has been taking in from foreigners . Foreign governments , in turn , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Treasury 's offering price of $35 per ounce , a price that many foreign officials apparently feel is a bargain . But the deeper cause of the gold drain involves the growth rate of the U.S. economy . If the economy had n't grown so fast in recent years , there probably would have been less price inflation , and the U.S. trade surplus  --  the excess of exports over imports  --  would no doubt have held up better , thereby curbing the outflow of dollars and gold . The U.S. trade surplus actually has declined about 5% since 1961 . Without a trade surplus to bring some dollars into the country , the flow of U.S. funds abroad to support foreign-aid projects , troops overseas and other foreign programs would reach intolerable proportions , most economists believe . Perhaps the most lamentable blemish in the boom is the high unemployment rate for teenage Negroes-25r ; in 1961 and 25% in boom-time 1967 Another dismal statistic : Some 7.8 million Americans are on relief at present , about 600,000 more than in 1961.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
