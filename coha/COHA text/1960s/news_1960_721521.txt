txt CAVANAGH LIFTS ONSIDE ? 4 BAN FORMOSTFIREMEN Those Getting Up to $8,000 Affected  --  Police Head Bars Any Changes By RALPH KATZ Fire Commissioner Edward F. Cavanagh Jr. , in a temporary modification of policy , yesterday authorized all firemen earning less than *8,000 a year to hold outside jobs . In effect , the change involved only the 4,000 firemen who have been appointed since October , 1956 . The 5,000 men who had joined the force earlier Were eligible for outside jobs under a ruling made in October , 1959 . Of the 5,000 , between 2,500 and 3,000 are said to have outside work now . The new relaxation of the rule against such jobs also permits 400 of the 1,427 lieutenants to accept casual employment . The lieutenants are those earning the minimum for their rank . When they receive their first year 's increase they will no longer be allowed to do outside work . Pay Differential Urged Police Commissioner Stephen P , Kennedy said , in commenting on the new Fire Department rule : " The rules of the Police Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the Fire Department allows outside employment , there should be a differential in pay for policemen . " Fairness is more important than tradition coupling the two Idepartments . Any other course would be sheer irresponsibility . Other cities have a pay differential between policemen and firemen because of the nature and demands of police work . " Mr. Cavanagh said his decision came after " many months of very careful study of the outside-job problems and after several conferences with Mayor Wagner . " He warned , however , that any impairment of efficiency of the department arising from outside casual employment would mean immediate and strict enforcement of the ban . Action Follows ** Meeting The announcement followed a three-hour meeting in Mr. Cavanagh 's office at the Municipal Building with representatives of the Uniformed Firemen 's Association and the Uniformed Fire Officers ' Association . Gerald P. Ryan , president of the firemen 's association , said his four-man committee would recommend acceptance of the change by the line organization 's executive board . " We still feel , " he added , " that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned . " He asserted that " to ' a degree " the plan was a victory for the firemen . John J. Corcoran , president // of the fire officers ' association , objected to limiting outside jobs to those earning up to $8,000 . Lieutenants , after they receive a $200-a-year pay increase on Jan. 1 , will earn a maximum of $8,313 a yeal .. 1 Mr. Cavanagh said he beI lieved the officers ' association ! would have been agreeable to the arrangement if it permitted 1 ioutside work to all Fire Deparment members below the rank of captain . That would make all lieutenants eligible . The Commissioner explained that he was sympathetic to fire men supplementing their income , by earning a " few dollars " on the outside because he recogI nized that under present economic conditions some were heavily burdened . He said that the temporary change of rules was not . the best solution to firemen 's problems , and that he hoped salaries would be raised so firemen would not need outside work . He declared that " firemen should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commissioner ' Cavanagh said he did not think " the principle of outside work ' should affect them . " Both firemen and fire officers had been banned from outside work when Mr. Cavanagh took office in 1954 . He lifted the ban in 1955 and reapplied it in 1959 to all officers and " to firemen who entered the ' department after October , 1956 . Mr. Cavanagh said seventeen new officers , including three assistant chiefs , would be appointed , if the Board of Estimate approved , to check on the efficiency of the force under ' the new arrangement . He said the department would take new action if studies showed that outside jobs impaired efficiency of the men . The suspension of the rule prohibits firemen from employment as salesmen for fire-alarm , fire-extinguishing or fire-protection equipment or services intended to correct or eliminate law violation under the enforcement of the Fire ' Department . It also forbids soliciting funds for commercial or professional fund-raising drives , where connection with the Fire Department would enhance a fireman 's value as a solicitor . And it bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would bring discredit to the department or a conflict of interests .
