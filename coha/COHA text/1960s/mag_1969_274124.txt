Most well-scrubbed Americans would be horrified at the idea of having mites crawling around on their faces . Yet almost half the U.S. population may play host to microscopic parasites , which reside in the facial hair of jet-setters and slum dwellers alike . This is the finding of Manhattan Ophthalmologist Jerry Jacobson . He and Australia 's Dr. Frank English reported at a New York Hospital conference that among recent adult patients , 40% had mites clinging to the roots of their eyelashes . <P> The facial mite , Demodex folliculorum , has been recognized since 1841 , but many doctors have been unaware of its existence , or have forgotten about it . Demodex rarely causes discomfort . It might have remained virtually unnoticed if Oklahoma Ophthalmologist Tullos O. Coston had not described its habitat and habits two years ago . <P> Only in Darkness . Following Coston 's procedure , Jacobson plucked several eyelashes from each adult patient . The microscope showed that of 300 patients , 120 had at least one Demodex clinging to their eyelashes , and some had dozens . The mite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 55 were infected ) and shun children . <P> Because the mite abhors light , it remains burrowed beneath the surface of the skin during daytime , venturing forth only in the darkness . Thus , it can not be detected even by careful scrutiny in front of a mirror . During its two-week life span , Demodex grows up , breeds and dies in the oily pores on the eyelid and elsewhere on man 's face without attracting attention . It makes its presence known only when something upsets the ecological balance of the face , encouraging the mites to overpopulate . Then they cause swelling in an eyelash pore , or spread bacterial infections into adjacent follicles during their nocturnal prowling . <P> The problems caused by the mites - matted eyelashes and itching lids-are best treated , Jacobson says , by careful washings with mild soap . Because Demodex feeds on the oily secretions of the hair follicle , women who avoid soaping their faces and use only cleansing creams ( which do not remove facial oils ) are natural targets for the tiny parasite . Regular washing reduces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive away all the mites . Until such a remedy is found , Ophthalmologist Coston says , " man must remain the dish of his uninvited guest .
