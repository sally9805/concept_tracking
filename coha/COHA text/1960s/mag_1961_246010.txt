From the far-flung corners of the Moslem world , pilgrims last week converged on Mecca , city of the Prophet 's birth , where they would make the ritual seven circuits around the shrouded monument and enter to kiss the Black Stone handed down by the Angel Gabriel to Abraham . If they took time to notice , they might have detected a change in the air . Along the six-lane highway that leads inland to Mecca from the Red Sea port of Jiddah , pilgrims were ministered to by mobile hospitals , reservoirs of ice water , and troops of Moslem Boy Scouts . In the capital of Riyadh , lights burned late in the massive ministries along the main , four-lane boulevard , and a Saudi businessman rejoiced : " Now you get decisions even without going personally to the top . " Said another : " Formerly when King Saud built a new palace , that was news . Now it 's news when he inaugurates a new factory for making bottled gas , as he did recently in Riyadh . " Inside the seven-mile-long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saud was embarking on a program of economic expansion and modest social reform . <P> Austerity Behind . By Saud 's decision , Saudi Arabia is leaving behind a two-year stretch of austerity that a man of his royal tastes found painful-even though the program was useful and was ably run by Saud 's younger brother , Crown Prince Feisal , 56 , the hawk-nosed heir to the throne . Taking over virtually all powers in 1958 , Feisal proceeded to turn in surplus budgets and stabilize the faltering rial at five to the dollar . He clipped the King 's and the princes ' spending money until they howled . He also patched up Saud 's feud with Nasser , who was understandably annoyed at reports that Saud had spent $5,000,000 trying to have him assassinated . But Feisal had his shortcomings . Says a Saudi merchant : " He would not delegate authority . Feisal had great , almost puritanical integrity , but he was not a man of decision . His desk piled high . Prices dropped but business died . " <P> Last December , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarrels , Saud accepted Feisal 's resignation as Premier and took the job himself . To get the economy moving , Saud turned to another brother , Prince Talal , 30 , who as Finance Minister runs the country with the help of its most powerful commoner , Abdullah Tariki , 42 , Minister of Petroleum , Mines and Education . <P> Moving Faster . Construction projects that halted two years ago will get going again , though the budget is to remain in balance . Talal and Tariki are busy on a $45 million-a-year program , drawn up by the World Bank , of small basic-development projects . Says Tariki , a University of Texas-trained geologist : " We need water , roads , education and , if possible , diversification of our economy . We have a planning board now , and things move much faster . " Talal and Tariki talk about a petrochemical industry to make use of the 200 million cubic feet of gas that go to waste daily in the oilfields .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
