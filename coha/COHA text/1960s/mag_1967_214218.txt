Back in the early 1930s , at about the time that Lockheed Aircraft Corp . was trying to pull itself out of bankruptcy , a 21 - year- old coal miner 's son named Daniel Jeremiah Haughton got his degree in accounting from the University of Alabama and headed for California . <P> After trying his hand at a number of jobs , he finally hired on with Lockheed in 1939 as a $275-a-month production specialist . Lockheed has since come to soar , and so has Dan Haughton . He became Lockheed 's executive vice president in 1956 , rose to president in 1961 , last week was named to succeed Courtlandt S. Gross as chairman of the board . <P> Haughton , 55 , is a hard-driving executive who rises at 4 o'clock every morning , works from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. , often comes into the office on Saturday . His successor as president is another nose-to-the-grindstone ex-accountant , Executive Vice President A. Carl Kotchian , 52 , a North Dakota-born finance specialist who has followed Haughton up the corporate ladder . In fact , Lockheed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with Haughton ( pronounced Hawton ) serving virtually as Court Gross 's alter ego , and Kotchian acting as Haughton 's . Not surprisingly , Haughton says that the new shifts portend " no great changes " in the company 's course . <P> Few are needed . Under Gross , who became chairman on the death of his brother Robert in 1961 , Lockheed has overcome its troubles of the 1950s , when it was beset by costly flops on a couple of aircraft ( Saturn and Constitution ) and crashes on others , notably the Electra . As the Defense Department 's biggest single contractor five years running , Lockheed has seen its profits increase to more than $51 million ( on sales of over $2 billion ) last year v. $37,200,000 in 1962 . Though disappointed over losing the SST competition to Boeing , the company expects continuing defense demands , diversification into such areas as oceanography , will keep it healthy . <P> In stepping aside , the patrician Gross , 62 , has moved from California to Philadelphia , where many of his relatives and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lockheed director , promises to remain a " working member " of the new Haughton-Kotchian team .
