txt on education What 's ahead ... A classroom turnabout  --  having students grade teachers ? is cutting a swath through American higher education . It 's nothing new . The grades-for-teachers idea is old hat in many institutions . In others it is still a surprising idea . But it is spreading fast . In a few colleges and universities in the years ahead , a teacher 's job may even depend on what his students think of him . Teacher grading takes many shapes . Several big schools  --  Oregon State , North Carolina , Minnesota , Michigan , Michigan State , Georgia Tech , Missouri , UCLA , Yale , Harvard  --  all have it in one form or another . More than a dozen other major schools are now experimenting with the idea or mulling its possibilities . It does n't swallow easily . Many teachers do n't take kindly to being graded by their students . But it is catching on anyhow . A scheme is afoot in West Germany to spread higher education to students who ca n't , but would if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of all German children are worthy of going on to higher educations . But only about 20 percent do . Those who do n't come mostly from farm-and working-class families traditionally against higher education , who want their children to start working instead . Dr. Paul Mikat , minister of culture of North Rhine-Westphalia , West Germany 's heaviest populated state , has opened special " day schools " aimed at changing this . Under his plan , gifted children from low-income homes go to school mornings and do homework afternoons under teacher supervision . When they graduate they are ready to go to college . So far , no other state has followed Dr. Mikat 's lead . But they are watching . Trends .. A worldwide drive to " get it right " is sweeping children 's textbooks . Often , texts that tell youngsters about people and customs in other lands swamp in a sea of distortions . The United States in some places is still pictured as overrun by cowboys and Indians . Several Scandinavian nations took the lead in hauling textbooks back on a truthful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their history and geography texts and correct errors . Many nations , following the Scandinavian suit , are now importing teams of experts to pore over their textbooks and suggest revisions . One ? educational foundation in Asia even goes in now for printing " before " and " after " pictures . One side of a page depicts how something used to be in Timbuktu . The other side shows how it now is . " Share-the-chair " programs are building up big followings in American universities . Single colleges often ca n't afford specialists in far-out subjects . A Panhandle Normal , for instance , may not be able to carry a course in Arabic , Mandarin Chinese , or Urdu all alone . But in consort with several neighboring colleges it might . Rice , Texas Southern , the Universities of Saint Thomas and Houston  --  all in Houston ? have set up a joint African studies program .

Birmingham , England , has nearly every modern educational problem rolled into one . Its teachers may soon strike . It suffers from a teacher shortage and may have to put its students on half days . Finaily , it has a color crisis . Its schoolmasters are demanding a nationwide royal commission on education . They say a truly independent inquiry into the state of British education is desperately needed . The government has already spurned the commission idea . But the issue will be raised again in the House of Commons . If the government still balks , Birmingham schoolmasters will strike . Birmingham 's teacher shortage is also under fire . One idea now afloat is to put pupils on half days and teachers on full time , while a longer-range solution is pursued . And in some Birmingham schools , colored students are outnumbering whites . In one , mothers of a now white minority are demanding the right to take their children out of classes , that would leave a segregated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
