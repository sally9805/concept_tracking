Christian Renewal <P> Sir : It is too late now , I know , but as a belated nomination for Man of the Year I suggest your own writer of the cover story on Christian renewal Dec. 25 . At least pat him on the back for me . He really caught the spirit of the thing-let 's hope that the rest of us can do the same . <P> ( MRS . ) KAY PRITSCHER Lexington , Ohio <P> Sir : If church renewal ever gets off the ground ( or if it ever gets down to earth ) , we can thank you for the significant contribution TIME has made . <P> RICHARD W. PETTIT Bay Methodist Church Bay Village , Ohio <P> Sir : Again you are one up on all those religious " trade publications . " You miss the obvious conclusion , however . God himself is producing this age referred to as " secular . " <P> ( THE REV . ) ANDREW G. KUNZ Trinity Episcopal Parish St. Louis <P> Sir : As a born and raised Roman Catholic , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature and keen pioneering spirit , worthy of the great thinkers and reformers . <P> MARIAN NOWAK Greenwich , Conn . <P> Sir : Once again TIME has produced a Christmas cover story that cries out for expressed appreciation . I am sure that the writer was imbued with the Christmas spirit . He did not run amuck into the obscure with unaided sincerity . I am sure that he found an ironic delight in spelling the name of that fine gentleman Dr. Schillebeeckx . <P> HAYDN L. GILMORE Chaplain Captain , U.S.A.F. Lowry AFB , Colo . <P> Sir : Reformation ? Can it be ? If thinkers like Bishops Robinson and Pike prevail , perhaps the church will again deserve my consideration . <P> ( MRS . ) ROBERTA STEWART Ames , Iowa <P> Sir : I read your discerning article in Madras , India , on a hot Christmas Day . It was most pertinent there , where Christian churches are so often decadent and often less relevant to the world than Communism is . But can the Christian church really give up supernaturalism , adhering only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universe to scientists ? I doubt it . <P> WILLARD JOHNSON Boston <P> Sir : The final reformation will come only when man sheds his supernaturalistic escapist fantasies and relates his perspective to reality and the natural world about him . <P> DAVID PERSUITTE Sundance , Wyo . <P> Sir : As an ordained Methodist minister and a graduate student of ecumenics , I can only marvel at the relevancy , scope , and balance of your article on Christian renewal . And as a former journalist , I can see both its journalistic and theological angles . The writer failed us in neither . <P> ( THE REV . ) LLOYD R. APPLEGATE West Warwick , R.I. <P> Sir : The church has always proved most relevant to the world when she did n't give a whoop whether she was temporally relevant or not . All these efforts to accommodate the church to time , and ignore eternity , lose both time and eternity . <P> BISHOP NOLAN B. HARMON Dictionary of World Methodism Atlanta <P> Sir : While Bishop John Robinson , Dr. Paul Tillich , Albert van den @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fellow heretics are spending eternity in the punishment they so richly deserve , the God of the Bible and his virgin-born son , Jesus Christ , will continue to be , as will the Holy Spirit and the church , the Body of Christ . <P> HOWARD WESLEY KIEFER Grace Bible Church Sheffield , Mass.
