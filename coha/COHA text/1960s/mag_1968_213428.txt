In an age of increasing affluence , the rich not only get richer but become more jaded in the process . And yet the high life somehow must go on . The challenge is to create an event so special , so sumptuous , so unequaled that it can not be missed . Everybody must talk about it for months , charter yachts , planes and limousines , book hairdressers , order new ball gowns , do and dare anything just to be there . No matter how boring it is once they get there , just having their names on the guest list automatically makes them Beautiful People . <P> All summer long , the word has been out : the target for September is Portugal , the occasion the twin parties to be given by Franco-American Oil Millionaire Pierre Schlumberger and Bolivian Tin King Antenor Patio . The Schlumbergers began getting ready for their bash four years ago , when they bought the 20-room 16th century Quinta do Vinagre ( Vinegar Villa ) at Colares , a coastal resort an hour 's drive west of Lisbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grounds into an illuminated Eden , complete with a chandeliered pavilion for dancing . Rumor had it that it was all costing $3,500,000 . Nonsense , snorted Schlumberger ; the sum was only in six figures . And if 1,200 seemed a large guest list , Mme. Schlumberger could only protest that she originally intended having 800 for the housewarming . But , she added , " people from all over the world begged on their knees to come . " Naturally , she could not refuse . <P> Candles and Cake . Neither , it seems , could anyone who got an invitation . Of notable names , there was no end : Umberto , ex-King of Italy ; Juscelino Kubitschek , ex-President of Brazil ; Stavros Niarchos , ex-husband of Charlotte Ford Niarchos . For titles , there were the Maharanee of Baroda , the Duke and Duchess of Bedford , Princess Ira von Furstenberg and Vicomtesse Jacqueline de Ribes . Salvador Dali materialized , so to speak . So did Hollywood Director Vincente Minnelli , Sonja Henie , Zsa Zsa Gabor , Audrey Hepburn , Franoise Sagan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the mounted Guarda Nacional Republicana were on hand at the Quinta do Vinagre : inside , 200 blue-liveried servants passed around flutes of champagne and a midnight snack of lobster salad . All night , the local Portuguese crowded to get a closer look at Gina Lollobrigida in a plunging pink ballgown , the Begum Aga Khan 's colossal diamond necklace and Sukarno 's ex-wife Ratna Sari Dewi in a tight red gown . Someone remembered that it was Henry Ford II 's 51st birthday , and everyone sang " Happy Birthday , dear Henry , " while he blew out the candles . It was 7 a.m. before Princess Irene of The Netherlands and Spain 's Prince Carlos de Bourbon accepted a cup of coffee and called it a night . <P> Embrace and Exclaim . Two nights later , it was Patio 's turn . At his 240-acre Quinta Patio , five miles away in Alcoitao , he had four bands , instead of the Schlumbergers ' two . The moon was bright , the night clear and cool , as Patio had hoped . And all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gowns , to embrace and exclaim . No one could bear to miss a moment . As Iran 's ex-Queen Soraya explained : " I 'm very pained over what happened in Iran . But an earthquake can happen anywhere . That 's no reason for me not to go to a ball . "
