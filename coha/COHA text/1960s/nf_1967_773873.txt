txt THE MUSIC OF THE JEWS the laments for the dead which were a customary feature of the mourning rites of the time . Undoubtedly the laments were originally confined to funeral obsequies , being sung , groaned , and wailed over the corpse , special bands of wailing women being appointed for the purpose . But the prophets exalted the form into a lament over the unhappy lot of the people , particularly at the time of the deportations to Babylon . The prophets greatly favoured them as a form of expression ; many of the qinot melodies have been handed down from generation to generation even to the present day . The Lamentations of Jeremiah are well known , but laments are to be found in the writings of other prophets too , though they are not always designated as such in the text . They vary greatly in their content , but in the majority of cases they express a tenderly lyrical mood . Instrumental music is frequently drawn upon to provide similes . For instance , Isaiah 16 , 11 : wherefore my bowels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ; or Jeremiah 48 , 36 : Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes ( ka-chalilim ) and mine heart shall sound like pipes ( ka-chalilim ) for the men of Kir-heres . ' Here , too , we may cite the later passage from Job 30 , 31 : My cythara ( kinnor ) is turned to a song of lamentation , And the shawm ( ugav ) to notes of mourning . ' Again , in Lamentations 5 , 14-15 , we read : The elders have vanished from the gate , The young men from their stringed playing ( mi-neginatam ) The joy of our heart is ceased , Our shawm ( mecholenu ) is turned to mourning . ' We learn of music-making in the secular life of the people mainly from indirect references , as , for instance , later , from the passage in Job 21 , 12 : They take up the tambourine ( tof ) and cythara ( kinnor ) ; they rejoice to the sound of the shawm ( ugav ) . There is frequent reference to instrumental playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amos 8 , 3 : And the songs of the palace shall be wailings in that day , ' ) and also among the people . Amos laments : They that pluck the harp ( ha-poretim al-pi ha-navel ) , like David have they invented themselves instruments of music 6o THE TWO KINGDOMS ( 6 , 5 ) . Note that here ha-poretim , from parat , means to produce single notes , to pluck , used in a rather contemptuous sense . It is noteworthy that the instrument mentioned is the nevel , the more primitive type of harp , as also previously in Amos 5 , 23 . Jeremiah remarks ( 31 , 4 ) : Thou ( Israel ) shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets ( tuppayich ) And shalt be drawn forth with the merry shawms ( bi-mechol mesachagim ) . In describing the forthcoming return from Babylonian exile he says ( 31 , 13 ) : Then shall the virgin rejoice in the playing of the flute ' ( be-machol ) As we have said before , there is no unanimity among the authorities as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 , 11 ) laments the decay and disappearance of the sound of thy ( Israel 's ) harps ' ( nevalecha ) . In Isaiah 23 , vs. 15 , 16 , we are even told of a Song of the Harlot ' : after the end of seventy years shall Tyre go forth as with the Song of the Harlot ' : Take the cythara ( kinnor ) Go about the city ; Thou forgotten harlot ! Make sweeter melody , Sing more , That man may remember thee . ' This short song or snatch of song must have been popular at this time , if Isaiah did not deliberately compose it to use in this context , where the wantonness of the king of Tyre is compared with the wantonness of a harlot . In any case , we can be quite sure that song was a feature of popular festivities and an accompaniment of wine-drinking . Isaiah says in chapter 5 , 1 : Now will I sing to my beloved , My friend , a song concerning his vineyard . ' And then ( chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up early in the morning , 6i THE MUSIC OF THE JEWS That they may follow after strong drink ; That sit on till late at night ; The wine heats them . And the cythara ( kinnor ) , the harp ( nevel ) , the tambourine ( t o f ) , the flute ( chalil ) and wine Are in their revels . ' Again : In that day sing ye unto her , A vineyard of red wine ' ( 27 , 2 ) . The mirth of tabrets ( tuppim ) ceases , The noise of them that rejoice endeth , The joy of the cythara ( kinnor ) ceaseth ; They shall not drink wine with a song , Their strong drink shall be bitter ' ( 24 , 8-9 ) . Continually stimulated by the example of king David , religious compositions also flourished . In the service of worship and during religious ( Yahve ) festivals psalms played a very important part . We devote all chapter six to discussion of the psalms , so will not enlarge on the matter here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence mentions any instrument we have not met with before . But one change has to be noted . A number of passages in which qeren is used indicate that it did not now refer to a wind instrument as in earlier passages , ' but was simply an expression symbolising power2 ; it also referred to temple ceremonies . CHAPTER V THE BABYLONIAN EXILE and THE RESTORATION OF THE TEMPLE ( 586-332 B.C. ) S the deportations to Babylon affected chiefly the upper strata of the Judaeans , it was natural that even in that distant land they were not assimilated in cultural , and still less in religious , respects . Truly , their forefathers had originally dwelt in the basin of the Euphrates ; but centuries had passed since then , they had adopted and absorbed some elements of the Egyptian and rather more of the Canaanite cultures ; but above all else , they had carried through a national , cultural and religious development specific to themselves . Consequently , during their sojourn in Babylon they felt spiritually in a strange land , ' and they struggled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revival and further development . Apart from the verbal expression of the religious service , the foreign influence affected their speech much more than the content of their lives , and this must also have applied in the sphere of music . But the references in Daniel 3 , especially verses 5 , 7 , 10 , and 15 , reveal the pressure of the Babylonian influence : That at what time ye hear the sound of the horn ( garna ) ' , flute ( mashroqita ) , cythara ( qatros ) , harp ( sabbekha ) , psaltery ( psanterin ) , bagpipe ( sumponya ) 2 and all kinds of music ( ve-khol THE MUSIC OF THE JEWS zene zemara ) ye fall down and worship the golden image . . . It is striking that nearly every one of these names is to be found only in this chapter , and nowhere else in the Scriptures . The brief period of the Babylonian exile , down to the first restoration of the Temple at Jerusalem , about 536 B.C. , gave the Judaeans time in which to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , forgetting all their former backsliding and disunity , to recognise that heritage as a national treasure which it was a sacred obligation to preserve . They unhesitatingly accepted all the ancient prescriptions as obligatory upon them , and all their knowledge of the past ordinances , legends , and stories was preserved in the faith that some day they would be handed down to coming generations in their ancestral homeland . They looked forward full of hope to the future in their own national land . The country of Judah itself was devastated ; inhabited only by a sparse and poverty-stricken population , it was in spiritual and economic chaos . The Israelite culture was moribund . In the north of Judah the Samaritans , only half Hebrew , predominated . About 539 B.C. Babylon was conquered by King Cyrus of Persia , and , acting in accordance with his conceptions of tolerance for the subdued peoples , and for political considerations , he set the Jews free to return to Judaea and to rebuild their temple . Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jerusalem , and had put them in the house of his gods ' ( Ezra 1 , 7 ) . Led by Zerubbabel , grandson of king Jehoiakim , who had died in Babylon , and by the priest Jeshua hen Jozadak , grandson of the Jerusalem priest Seriah , who had been executed by Nebuchadnezzar , some 50,000 Jews wandered hack to their homeland . And among them were two hundred singing men and singing women ' ( meshorerim u-meshorerot ) ( Ezra 2 , 65 , ; see also Nehemiah 7 , 67 ) . Thus they returned home with music , with song and with the playing of instruments . For we read : THE BABYLONIAN E X I L E Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem , in the second month , began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , and Jeshua the son of Jozadak , 4nd the remnant of their brethren the priests and Levites , and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem , and appointed the Levites , from twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house of the Lord . Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren , Kadmiel and his sons , the sons of Judah , together , to set forward the workmen in the house of God : the sons of Henadad , with their sons and their brethren the Levites . And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the Lord , they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets ( chatzotzerot ) and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals ( metziltayim ) to praise the Lord , after the ordinance of David king of Israel . And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the Lord , because he is good , for his mercy endureth for ever toward Israel . And all the people shouted with a great shout , when they praised the Lord , because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid . But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers , who were ancient men , that had seen the first house , when the foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a loud voice ; and many shouted aloud for joy , so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people ; for the people shouted with a loud shout , and the noise was heard afar off ' ( Ezra 3 , 8-13 ) . This yearning for a house of the Lord ' and the urge to restore it so soon after their return to Judah were very natural , for in religious respects the Jews had felt constrained in the strange land ' of Babylon . When the temple was destroyed and the people were deported they were no longer able to observe the temple ordinances , nor could they offer up sacrifices , whether in exile or in Judah . In Babylon the one substitute for the temple worship was the religious assembly which each apparently autonomous local community organised . Now they had returned to their native land , and once more they could have their true temple , in full accordance with tradition . From all the narratives // of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temple ordinances , as they had been handed down by oral and written tradition , were accepted as decisive and binding . However , owing to the intrigues of the Samaritans and of the alien tribes dwelling in the land ? in which connection the political unrest and the Persian wars must also have had considerable influence ? the work of building the temple was not completed at this time . The task was not taken up again until sixteen years later , in the reign of king Darius , and was completed in 516 B.C. And then the Children of Israel , the priests , and the Levites , and the rest of the children of the captivity , kept the dedication of this house of God with joy . . . . And they set the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their courses , for the service of God , which is at Jerusalem ; as it is written in the book of Moses ' ( Ezra 6 , 16 and 18 ) . This second temple ' was not on such a magnificent scale as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we learn from the contemporary prophets Haggai and Zechariah , it stimulated the Judaeans to fresh spiritual and intellectual development . So Jerusalem again became a vital centre of religious life , and ? seventy years after the destruction of the first temple ' ? seemed to have regained its former place as the home of the Israelite Cult . But , despite this religious restoration , the Jews were unable to accomplish either a religious renaissance , or even moderate political independence for their country . The local indigenous life had been overborne by too many foreign elements . Thus their hopes of revival were disappointed , until Ezra son of Seraiah , a priest and learned in the writings ' ( ha-kohen ha-so f er ) , organised a second return and restoration . He obtained plenipotentiary powers from king Artaxerxes I , Longimanus , and entered Jerusalem in the year 457 B.C. , bringing with him of the Children of Israel , and of the priests , and the Levites , and the singers , and the porters , and the servants ' ( Ezra 7 , 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He rallied the national aspirations and endeavours around himself , and set to work at once to reform and renew the religious life of the people , which , as is always the case at such times , was hardly separable from their public and private life . To assist him , king Artaxerxes himself appointed his own cupbearer , Nehemiah son of Hachaliah , as governor , with full // powers , in 444 B.C. The twelve years Nehemiah spent in Jerusalem as governor were very fruitful for Jewish spiritual , political and social revival . His first step was to set about the rebuilding of the city wall , in order to separate and secure the people and their cult from the outer world . He tells us that during the rebuilding of the wall , for the builders , every one had his sword girded by his side , and so builded . And he that sounded the shofar was by me ' ( Nehemiah 4 , 12 ) . When the wall and the city gate were completed , he appointed porters and singers and the Levites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ezra he set about complete restoration . They dedicated the wall with great pomp , once more , it appears , in the desire to follow the example of king David and king Solomon . And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places , to bring them to Jerusalem , to keep the dedication with gladness , both with thanksgiving , and with singing , with cymbals ( metziltayim ) , harps ( nevalim ) and cytharas ( kinnorot ) ( ibid. , 12 , 27 ) . And Nehemiah brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall , and appointed two great choruses of thanksgiving and festivity , one on the right hand upon the wall towards the dung-gate . And after them went Hoshaiah , and half of the princes of Judah . And of the priests ' sons with trumpets ( chatzotzerot ) Zechariah . . . And his brethren . . . with the musical instruments of David ( bi-khele shir David ) the man of God , and Ezra the scribe before them .. . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , and I ( Nehemiah ) after them , and the half of the people upon the wall , over the tower of the furnace as far as the broad wall .... So the two choruses of thanksgiving stood still in the House of God , and I , and half of the rulers with me ; and the priests . . . with the trumpets ( chatzotzerot ) . . . And the singers sang , with Jezrahiah , their overseer ... and both the singers and the doorkeepers kept the ward of their God . . . according to the commandment of David , and of Solomon his son ' ( Nehemiah 12 , vs. 31-2 , 35-6 , 38 , 40-42 , 45 ) . The worship of God was reinstituted in the Temple , and music and song were again cultivated . As Nehemiah says : And Mattaniah the son of Micha , the son of Zabdi , the son of Asaph , was the principal to begin the thanksgiving in prayer ; and Bakbukiah the second thereafter of his brethren , and Abda // the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son of Jeduthun . ' We are not in a position to determine whether these genealogies , tracing the line back to the two singers , Asaph and Jeduthun , of David 's time , are imaginary or real , though it must be pointed out that only three generations are mentioned in each instance , to cover some five hundred years . But in any case they indicate an hereditary interest in a musical profession . This passage also justifies the deduction that at this period the service of prayers provided for a soloist ( precentor ) , i.e. , Mattaniah , and a choir . Altogether there were two hundred and eighty-four Levites in the holy city , and we are told that their overseer was Uzzi , the son of Bani , the son of Hashabiah , the son of Mattaniah , the son of Micha , of the sons of Asaph , the singers in the service of the house of God . For it was the king 's commandment concerning them , and the singers were obliged by covenant : the day 's honorarium for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Mattaniah , he and his brethren , were for the giving of devotions . . . And the chiefs of the Levites . . . with their brethren over against them , to praise and give thanks according to the commandment of David . . . ' ( ibid. , 12 , 8 , 24 ) . Social reforms and reforms in religious practices were carried through at the same time . The Torah , or Teaching ( i.e. , the Pentateuch ) , was recognised as binding more perhaps than ever before in Israelite history . In the temple service great trouble was taken to follow David 's and Solomon 's ordinances as faithfully as possible . The prophets yielded place to the scribes ( so f Brim ) . The scribes , of whom Ezra was the first to be called by that name as well as priest ( ha-kohen ) conducted the religious assemblies , called by the Greek word synagogues , ' at which the Torah was taught and expounded . The reading and singing of psalms also formed an essential part of the devotions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Babylon , where the synagogues ' had been a substitute for divine service in the temple , and it was Ezra who developed it on a larger scale . We know that at a later period in Jewish history these synagogues took over the observance of the temple sacred service and its service of sacrifice . Apart from this revived national , spiritual , and religious centre in Jerusalem , a temple also existed for those whom Judah rejected // and regarded as unclean . The Samaritan leader Sanballat erected a temple on Mount Gerizim , in which the priests , Levites , and scribes expelled from the Jewish community at Jerusalem conducted the service . Their cult consisted of a mingling of ancient Israelite and later Judaic elements . However , by this time there were Jewish colonies outside Palestine : in Babylon , Syria , Iran , Asia Minor , and Egypt , in each of which Jews were developing their own communities . For all these communities the restored Jerusalem was the model and symbol ; it was the object of all their aspirations , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially those in Babylon and later that at Alexandria , had a reciprocal influence on the Judaean homeland , for a number of them were at times very strong not only economically but culturally . After the exile to Babylon a part of Jewry was always broken into geographically sundered groups , with their spiritual centre in Judah , but living scattered among alien peoples , in the Diaspora . Outside influence on the Israelites ' musical culture had probably been quite strong in the past ; but , as is always the case , such influence was exerted even more strongly on the Diaspora . Yet , as time passed , the communities scattered in the Diaspora saw more and more clearly that it was their task to maintain the tradition , and so they increasingly became the conservators of the ancient music of their ancestral homeland . 6g CHAPTER VI THE PSALMS we have remarked in previous chapters , there was a great S development of religious poetry in ancient Israel . Of course , many of the songs we have discussed were not included in the collection known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same category , of songs of praise and devotion to God . Many passages in the Book of Psalms are to be found elsewhere in the Scriptures , in Chronicles , for instance . This is because the recording , or perhaps the collection of the psalms into a single book , occurred at a comparatively late period , when the texts were already well known orally , and so it was easy to insert passages from them in other writings.2 We can do no more than make some attempt to determine the original source of such a passage by studying its character or its allusions , such as point to definite historical events . For instance , the Psalms of the King , ' i.e. , those which praise God as king , could hardly have been composed before the times of the Israelite kings , for previously the entire conception of kingship had been alien to Israelite thought . Thus , the phrase He ( Yahve ) is become king ' would signify that the people of Israel had once more placed themselves under Yahve , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God ( the most High Lord ) . The oldest of the psalm poems date back to the earliest days of the Children of Israel , and had their beginnings at the time of the first religious lyrics . We know that the Israelites must have been influenced by the hymn and psalm poetry of the Babylonians T H E PSALMS and Egyptians when they dwelt among these peoples.1 Also , in recent years a great deal of information on the religious poetry of the Canaanites has come to light , and there is little doubt that it exerted a profound influence on Israelite poetry and music . The psalms waxed and waned in popularity among the Children of Israel in accordance with their attitude to their religion at any moment ; when alien , non-Israelite religious practices had less hold upon them , then their own Israelite psalms were more in favour as an essential part of the temple service and of religious worship generally . This is shown , for example , by the fact that the composition and dissemination of psalms were most marked in the days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly the Israelites were influenced by the poetry of non-Israelite peoples , in their psalms they achieved such a high development of poetic language and imagination that a new kind of poem was bound to result . They themselves realised that their psalms contained much that was new , otherwise they would not so often have described them as new . For instance , Psalm 40 , 4 , says : He hath put a new song in my mouth , A song of praise unto our God . ' Similarly Psalm 96 , 1 ( also 98 , 1 ) : 0 sing unto the Lord a new song , Sing unto the Lord , all the earth . ' It is impossible to determine exactly when each psalm or group of psalms was created , or who was its author , but we can be sure that the form dates back to the earliest days of Israelite lyrical poetry . And we do know that the first kings of Israel did much to foster the art , irrespective of whether they themselves wrote and sang psalms , or whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if we accepted the opinion that the Book of Psalms as we know it to-day includes none by king David himself , we can still take it for granted that he had a THE MUSIC OF THE JEWS considerable influence on the psalmists of his time . As the Israelite Cult took stronger hold of the nation and as the prophets grew in influence there was increasing resort to the writing and singing of psalms , and the art came to its finest flower contemporaneously with the great age of prophecy , from the eighth to the fifth centuries B.C. It can hardly be said that there was any development or change in the character of the psalms after the states of Judah and Israel were overthrown and the people were carried off into exile ; but this may be due to a spiritual attitude which we find expressed in Psalm 137 , verse 4 : How shall we sing the Lord 's song in a strange land ? ' In their exile , all the past achievements of Jewish national and religious life came to be regarded as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one rallying-point in defence of national solidarity . In exile the Jewish community , holding itself apart from the alien environment , lived in the strength of the past days of glory , defending the ancient traditions . On the return from exile they rallied still more strongly around their traditions , and probably only a few psalms and hymns were written in the ensuing period . Psalms were generally appreciated and sung or recited in public after 500 B.C. , but their poetic quality was already declining . The writing of psalms probably came to an end in the days of the Maccabees , in the middle of the second century B.C. The Book of Psalms contains 150 songs . ' The Septuagint2 includes a 151st psalm , which has the duel between David and Goliath as its subject ; but it is regarded as apocryphal . The book as we know it to-day consists of various groups of psalms brought together to make the one collection . Thus , there are the psalms of Korah , the psalms of Asaph , and the psalms of David , differentiated from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are isolated psalms ascribed to Solomon , and others which have no ascription at all . The psalms of Korah and Asaph , and THE PSALMS certain of those of David were probably appointed for the temple service and sung or otherwise rendered during the service . On the other hand , the psalms of David include a number of poems that could not have been written for religious use . Most of these have a superscription which includes a brief biographical note indicating when and where David composed them . ( Psalms 51 , 52 , 54 , 56 , 57 , 59 , 63 . ) Apparently the circumstances in which they were composed and first publicly presented were not connected with religious practice . Professor N. H. Tur-Sinai ( formerly Torczvner ) of Jerusalem , has recently put forward the theory that the psalms are songs which the writer of the story of David interspersed with his narrative of historic events , in order to illustrate them , just as later the Latin historians of Roman times inserted speeches into their histories . ' We have no certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superscription : shir ha-maalot or shir la-maalot , as the meaning of the word maalot is unknown The Talmudic commentaries assume that it means pilgrimages , signifying that the psalms bearing this superscription are among those that may have been sung on the occasion of the three festivals of Passover , Pentecost , and Tabernacles during the pilgrim 's journey to Jerusalem , or on similar occasions . Authorities divide the entire collection of psalms into five books . Gunkel , in his Einleitung in die Psalmen , ' distinguishes the following types : hymns , songs of Yahve 's ascent of the throne , people 's songs of lamentation , psalms of the king , individual songs of lamentation , individual songs of thanks , and various smaller classes ( expressions of victory , of malediction , the pilgrimage songs , the songs of victory , the songs of thanks of Israel , legends , and the Torah ) . Like most classifications , the foregoing is only approximately correct , as it is rare for any one poem to fall exclusively into one class . On studying the psalms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we must turn first and foremost to the psalms of David . The majority of these ( 53-62 , 68 , 69 ) have superscriptions containing terms which , it is generally accepted , indicate the manner in which they are to be rendered . UnfortuTILE MUSIC OF THE JEWS nately , we do not know exactly what these terms signify , especially those which are assumed to point to the musical interpretation . ( We give a list of these terms in the Appendix . ) Even the Septuagint fails to provide any satisfactory information on the subject . Consequently , authorities have hazarded various opinions as to their application to the musical aspect or interpretation of the psalms in which they are used . Some would confine certain of them , e.g. , at ha-gittit ( A. V. upon Gittith , ' Psalms 8 , 81 , 84 ) ; at mut ( A. V. Psalm 9 , upon Muth ' ) ; at alamot ( Psalm 46 , ' upon Alainoth ' ) ; at yonat elem rechoqim ( like doves the distant trees , ' Psalm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. V. Al-Taschith , Psalms 57 , 58 , 59 , 75 ) ; at shushan edut ( Psalm 60 ) ; al shoshannim ( Psalm 69 ) ; el shoshannim edut ( Psalm 80 ) to the place where the melodies came into being , others to the melody to which the given psalm was to be sung ; while there are yet other explanations . Many of the obscurities are perhaps to be ascribed to errors in transcription , which now can not be cleared up . So no light can be thrown on this group of problems . In the work already mentioned ' Tur-Sinai has recently propounded new explanations of a number of these terms . Thus he suggests that the word shoshan is the cyperus papyrus on which the scribes indited the poems ( cf. Accadian shishnu , shishanu , and Syrian shishna ) . The expressions anot , shir , hazkir , lammed , etc. , are to be understood only by reference to the history in which the particular psalm was inserted : i.e. , the song which David ordered to be sung , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ el hanchilot , at hashminit , at hagittit , at alamot , etc. , are simply abbreviations for : David ordered the songs to be sung on Nehilot ' ; or : David ordered the maidens ( alamot ) to sing this and that . ' ( One may recall David 's words in his lamentation over Saul : II Samuel 1 , 24 Daughters of Israel , weep over Saul . ) Shire Hama'alot are songs to accompany the lifting of the Ark of the Covenant , sung by David and Solomon when the Ark was kept in Jerusalem . Other poets later wrote further poems on the same subject ( see Psalm 132 ) , including poets of the generation which returned THE PSALMS from the exile to Babylon , especially when they began to rebuild the Temple . Tur-Sinai comments that the Psalms can only be understood by having regard to the situation to which their authors or modifiers fitted them . Certain internal allusions can reveal what was the purpose for which the particular psalm was written ( they have very differing functions ) and where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was said when questioning an oracle : I incline mine ear to the verdict , Unveil my questions upon the harp ( kinnor ) . ' But the most usual subject is the expression of homage , and gratitude to and yearning for the Eternal , ' to God : My soul longeth , yea , even fainteth for the courts of the Lord ; My heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God . ' ( Psalm 84 , 2 . ) Blessed are they that dwell in thy house ; They will be always praising thee . ' ( Psalm 84 , 4 . ) Praise waiteth for thee , 0 God , in Zion . ' ( Psalm 65 , 1. ) 0 come , let us sing unto the Lord ; Let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation ; Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving , And make a joyful noise unto him with psalms . ' ( Psalm 95 , 1-2 . ) I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while I have my being . ' ( Psalm 104 , 33 . ) Sing unto him ( shiru lo ) Make music unto him ( zammeru lo ) . ' ( Psalm 105 , 2 . ) While I live I will praise the Lord ; // I will make music unto my God while I have any being . ' ( Psalm 146 , 2 . ) We can turn now to discussion of the manner in which the psalms were rendered , at least , in so far as we find indications in various passages of the psalms themselves . So far as we can tell froln such passages , they were sometimes spoken , said ' ; sometimes they were cantillated , in a rising and falling tone ; and sometimes they were sung . There could not have been a very great difference between these various techniques , and the difference depended not so much on the text itself as on the occasion ( holy days , days of mourning , days of festivity , and so on ) ; and on the place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rendering of a Levite must have been very different from that of a layman . Despite the great length of time which has elapsed since the heyday of Jewish psalm-writing , their melodic settings have to some extent survived to our times ; many of them were even taken over by the early Christian church together with the words , and were perpetuated in Roman Catholic ritual . We shall deal with this question in chapter nine , when discussing the neginot , or synagogal tropes , and the teamim , the accent marks found in the Jewish scriptures . Much of what we have said in previous chapters about Jewish music is applicable to the problem of performance of the psalms , and in fact much is applicable exclusively to them . Moreover , the Biblical texts can themselves help to fill out our knowledge of the circumstances and background in which psalms were rendered . I have seen the procession for thee , 0 God , The procession into the sanctuary for my God , my King . The singers went before , The string-players ( nogenim ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( be-tokh alamot to f e f ot ) .

' ( Psalm 43 , 4 . ) I will also praise thee with the harp ( nevel ) Because thou preservest , my God , To play on the cythara ( kinnor ) . ' ( Psalm 71 , 22 . ) The psalms , whether sung , said , or chanted , could be rendered by various combinations of voices .

Psalm-singing was the frequent accompaniment of processions on special occasions , as we see for instance in Psalm 68 already quoted , and in Nehemiah 12 , 27-28 and 31 : And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places , to bring them to Jerusalem , to keep the dedication with gladness , both with thanksgiving , and with song , cymbals ( metziltayim ) , harps ( nevalim ) and cytharas ( kinnorot ) . And the singers gathered together . . . and ( I ) appointed two great companies of them that give thanks , whereof one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate . . . According to II Chronicles 20 , 19 , it was usually The Levites of the sons of Kohath , and of the sons of Korah , ' who praised the God of Israel with a loud voice on high .

On the other hand , in Chronicles and elsewhere there is frequent mention of the singers Asaph , IIeman , Ethan and Jeduthun , the descendants of the three Levitical families of Gershom , Kahat , and Merari . In The Old Testament , its Origin and Tradition , ' Sir William Smith concludes that after ' The singers , the children of Asaph , a hundred twenty and eight ' ( or alternatively an hundred forty and eight ) ( Ezra 2 , 41 , and Nehemiah 7 , 44 ) had returned from exile they were the only singers in the Temple , while in Chronicles the sons of Korali arc referred to as doorkeepers , so that in the days of Nehemiah they were not yet , and in the time of the Chronicles , no longer singers in the Temple . Gunkel challenges this view , being rather of the opinion that , conformably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 31 ; and II Chronicles 20 , 19 , the Korahites have to be reckoned among the Levites . Instrumental music was prominent in the temple service generally , but especially in the rendering of the psalms . This is evident from the following passages ( although the exact meaning of certain phrases can not now be established , we give the translations of these ) : Praise the Lord with cythara ( kinnor ) Make him music on the ten-stringed harp ( benevel asor ) . Sing unto him a new song ( shir chaclash ) ; Play finely with jubilant sound ( hetivu nagen bi-teru'ah ) . ' ( Psalm 33 , 2-3 . ) ... I sing , play up ( ashira va-azammerah ) .

We get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : By the rivers of Babylon , we sojourned , Ah , we wept , When we thought of Zion .

" How shall we sing the Lord 's song In a strange land ? ' Even to-day there are many , chiefly orthodox and conservative Jewish communities which , influenced by this psalm , will not allow any musical instrument to be played in synagogues outside Palestine , except perhaps at weddings , although all the psalms are included in the present-day synagogue service and many of them contain references to instrumental playing . In conclusion , we may repeat that all we have said about Jewish music in scriptural times essentially applies to the Psalms also ; even the instruments mentioned are the same . But as it is accepted by all authorities to-day that the Book of Psalms contains poems from various periods of Israelite history , that is quite natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 332 B.C. to 73 C.E. ) THE detailed consideration we have given to the music of the Children of Israel has enabled us to make a very wide survey of the origin and development of their cultural life in the sphere of music , in so far as it is at all possible to reconstruct that life . In the course of our survey we have seen that during the first thousand years of Israelite history in their own country the Cult peculiar to them became the chief centre of musical activity . Accepting the assumption that the Jewish scriptures came into being and were recorded either before or during the Babylonian exile , we can make two alternative deductions in regard to the music of pre-exile times . Either the tradition as thus recorded faithfully communicated the nature of the music in those bygone days , in which case we still have the actual details of that music ; or , on the other hand , the details have , truly , been passed down to us , but modified by the forms of expression current at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept that the scriptural records of Israelite music for any period before the Babylonian exile were not entirely true to the past , but were affected by contemporary musical custom . On the other hand , if the books of the Pentateuch did in fact come into being before the rest of the scriptures , as the great majority of biblical authorities consider , they contain the oldest records of Israelite music . In any case , so far as the majority of the other books now included in the biblical canon ? covering chiefly the histories and the books of the prophets ? are concerned , we appear to be justified in accepting as a fact that they were committed to writing not later than in Ezra 's day ; and that this was one of the tasks assigned to the soferim , or scribes , by the Keneset ha-Gedolah , or Great Assembly , which is said to have been founded by Ezra after the return from Babylon . They were taken down wholly or TILE MUSIC OF THE JEWS partly from oral tradition , which perhaps was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justifies the assumption that details of music given in these writings cover the period down to the times of Ezra . So far as the Books of Ezra and Nehemiah are concerned , these are purely historical records , compiled from accounts supplied either by Ezra and Nehemiah themselves , or by circles in close touch with them . So here we find ourselves on contemporary ground , and we need no longer consider the possibility of great deviations from the actual state of affairs , so long as we accept the reliability of the historians themselves . This is one reason why we shall not consider the next cultural period ( which in any case really consists of more than one period ) in such great detail as those preceding it ; for we no longer need to consider various possible hypotheses , nor do we have to supply so many conjectural details . We must add that most of the available sources for details of the next period of Jewish culture are in Greek , and that references to music are extremely scanty . Down to the last third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its forms , usages , and practices were being developed and extended ; it was in process of creation by the Children of Israel themselves . But with Ezra came a fundamental change in the direction of organisation of the state , and this entailed a momentous cultural change . Under Ezra and Nehemiah the people of Judah cut themselves off from the outer world in both racial and cultural regards ; and they became the chief exponents of the Israelite cultural and religious heritage . On the other hand , on the periphery , so to speak , there were now Jewish centres in the Diaspora , primarily in Babylon and Egypt , and at various times these centres came to have great importance . Some indication of their importance can be gained from the fact that the rabbis of the Babylonian community produced their own version of the Talmud , much fuller than that of the Jerusalem community , and that the Alexandrine Jews were responsible for the Septuagint translation of the Jewish scriptures . Because of this development of centres in the Diaspora we shall speak in future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who followed the Israelite religion , of which the spirit and the culture is called Judaism . By the time Ezra completed his reforming // activities this people had reached a point in cultural development in which it regarded the written and oral tradition as unimpugnable , and this was bound to arrest that development to some extent . True , later generations of Jews produced a mass of writings , but with small exceptions these were essentially in the nature of commentaries , based on the Scriptural canon . Development in the Israelite Cult , with its attendant musical practice , was dictated by the constitution of their religion . Constitutionally this was founded on the Covenant ' which , according to tradition , the Children of Israel had concluded with their one God . Strictly speaking , the problem of belief in this God was not discussed in the Jewish scriptures ; so far as we know they contain no special word or verbal formula for this conception ? for I believe in , ' for instance . In the course of time this Covenant ' acquired all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was the prophets who first laid emphasis on the spiritual content of the Covenant , ' and in doing so gave the Israelite religion a spiritual basis . On the other hand , even in the days of the prophets music , as a phenomenon attendant on all religious activities and institutions , and on the rite itself , provided no special impulse towards the representation of beauty in the Greek sense or towards the development of a spiritual content for itself , but continued simply to be part of the Cult . Consequently , only when there was a far-reaching and fundamental formulation of the Cult , such as occurred in king David 's time , could music acquire new or deeper significance . In such circumstances the final formulation of the manner in which the psalms , for instance , were to be rendered must have opened up new possibilities in musical practice , in this case chiefly in vocal regards . We can be sure that the psalms played a very important part in the vocal aspect , i.e. , the singing , of the Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 332 B.C. , the Jewish people were subjected to quite new outside influences , and had to struggle to maintain their traditions , while all their national character , their viability and powers of resistance were put to the proof . Previously the Israelites had come into effective cultural contact only with oriental peoples , chiefly the Babylonians , Assyrians , Egyptians , Canaanites , and surrounding tribes . During the evolutionary period of their history they acquired // a great deal from these oriental peoples , while rejecting and prohibiting much more out of a spirit of opposition . As they , like the other oriental peoples to some extent , were in an evolutionary and formative phase , they were able to take over alien elements more easily . In this phase , too , they could easily refashion and spiritually subdue what they took over , if it was in accordance with their own characteristics . Thus they were able to assimilate a great deal especially from Babylonian and Canaanite cultures . By the fourth century B.C. the Jewish nation had acquired a distinctive taste for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultural life . But now non-oriental peoples , first the Greeks and then the Romans , each of whom had achieved their own distinctive development and represented quite a different world , acquired a dominating role in the life of the people of Judah . The music of the Greeks and the Romans must have had only trifling influence on that of the Jews . There is nothing to show how far that influence extended or what modifications it effected . On the other hand , there are a number of sources depicting the Jewish struggle to maintain their national religion and its observances . Since we must accept that during both the Hellenic and the Roman cultural period music was of importance only in association with the Cult , we must conclude that neither the Greek nor the Roman Cult could have influenced it essentially , since the Jews were successful in maintaining their national characteristics , doing so with determination and even by resort to arms . Beyond doubt , during these periods there was a greater cleavage between the music of the Cult and secular music than ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hellenists , as they were called , those who advocated the Hellenising of Judah , gradually took over a certain amount of Greek culture . As the Judaeans came into contact with Greek , and later with Roman , culture through gymnasia , ' theatres , and other activities , they must have absorbed some of the alien song , and possibly instrumental music . But as they very zealously defended their Jewish religion and the temple music from foreign influences , it must have diverged even more from the tastes and perceptions of foreign contemporaries . In consequence the temple music must have sounded antiquated , obsolete ; yet the keepers of the temple tradition insisted that it could not be changed by one jot or // tittle . We know that such an attitude could not be maintained in its entirety . But we note as a characteristic feature of the Greek and Roman epochs that the temple music grew still more antiquated and that there was an even greater cleavage and alienation between it and profane music . How far Jewish secular music was influenced by Greek music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representation of beauty , we have no means of telling . We must assume that it had some influence , for at one time the Judaeans shared very actively in the life and the customs of the Greeks , and later of the Romans . And , of course , these secular acquisitions must ultimately have had influence on Jewish religious music . Of one thing we can be certain , the devout Judaeans took nothing consciously from the Greeks and Romans , least of all in the sphere of religious music . On the contrary , they fought , even with weapons , against everything they regarded as alien and not inherent in the tradition , and continued to do so even after they had lost all autonomy in their own country . When Alexander of Macedon conquered the Persian Empire in 332 B.C. , Judah also fell under his rule . The oriental influence was rapidly replaced by the Greek . The international Aramaic language , which the Jews also used in everyday life , was gradually replaced by Greek . Judah was united politically with Syria to form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direction of the country 's cultural development . The Jewish community in Alexandria , the city founded by Alexander , grew to great importance . It was the first Jewish community to come into contact with Greek culture , and for a time it was the intermediary between Jews and Greeks . It was responsible for the translation of most of the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek ( especially the Septuagint ) , with the object of disseminating them among non-Hebrew-speaking Jews , and also among the Greeks . In Judah itself the Hellenist Jews who attempted to introduce Greek culture into the country were vigorously opposed by the so-called Chasidim . ' ' The Chasidim , ' or devout , ' called upon Jews to be true to Judaism , and struggled desperately against the THE MUSIC OF THE JEWS Hellenistic trends ; but from the days of the Hasmoneans ( Maccabees ) onward they had to fight simultaneously not only against the Hellenists but also against the foreign domination of the state . They achieved serious results only in the sphere where the influence of the Hellenists and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worship . Yet even in these times the service in the Temple at Jerusalem was conducted with great pomp . Jeshua ben Eliezer ben Sira ( Jesus , son of Sirach ) has left us an impressive description of the service as it was conducted in the Greek period . In Ecclesiasticus ' he describes the priest Simon in the following words : He stretched out his hands to the sacrificial cup , and poured of the blood of the grape ; he poured out at the foot of the altar a sweet-smelling savour unto the most high king of all . Then shouted the sons of Aaron , the priests , and sounded the trumpets of chased work ; they made a great noise to be heard , for a remembrance before the most High . Then all the people together hasted and fell down to the earth upon their faces , to worship their Lord God Almighty , the Holy one of Israel . The singers also sang praises with their voices , with great variety of sounds was there made sweet melody . ' ( Ecclesiasticus 50 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesser details which show that in liturgical respects and in the rendering of the songs of praise ' ( the psalms ) much that dated from former times had been preserved in its integrity . In any case all these details reveal that the Holy Scriptures provided the prototype , and we find no essential modifications of biblical usages . Thus , in the description of the festival of victory after Judith had killed Holofernes , we read : Then Judith began to sing this thanksgiving in all // Israel , and all the people sang after her this song of praise . And Judith said : Begin unto my God with timbrels , Sing unto my Lord with cymbals . Tune unto him a new psalm ; Exalt him and call upon his name . ' ( Judith 16 , 1-2 . ) During the rule of the Seleucids open conflict developed between the Chasidim , who guarded the tradition , and the Hellenists . This dissension culminated in the desecration of the Temple by image worship , when Antiochus Epiphanes attempted to force the Judaeans to follow the Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originally to secure the restoration of the Jewish religious service , but it was so successful that the Judaeans were able to throw off the foreign yoke and achieve independence . Naturally , with independence came the restoration of the Jewish religion and all its former practices . I Maccabees 4 , 54-55 , relates that the Temple at Jerusalem was newly consecrated with songs , and cytharas and harps , and cymbals . And all the people fell on their faces , worshipping and praising toward heaven him who had given them good success . ' This festival is again mentioned in II Maccabees 10 , 7 . During the Maccabean wars there were frequent opportunities to purify the ritual from the use of idols and image worship . ( I Maccabees 13 ; 47 , 51 . ) In the descriptions of such ceremonies we are struck by the part played by the songs of praise , ' i.e. , the psalms , as well as various instruments , harps , and cytharas , and stringed instruments , and cymbals . The Third Book of the Maccabees , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but simply as a collection of untrustworthy legends , mentions a round dance of the liberated Jews , who employed the time during the festival in joyful thanksgiving and psalms . ' In the sphere of non-religious music the Greeks must certainly have had a strong influence . Above all , the Jews would have adopted a good deal of Greek secular song . The Greek philosophers and poets must have effected a steady and increasing modification of the Judaeans ' outlook on such questions . The spirit of the Greeks , whether it spread from Hellenic Egypt or // from other parts of the Greek world , left its traces everywhere . The Second Book of Maccabees provides sufficient details to show how even influential Jews ( or perhaps especially these ) yielded to the Hellenic pressure . One can imagine what strength the assimilation trends acquired with the course of time , when one reads that even the priests had no courage to serve any more at the altar , but despising the Temple , and neglecting the sacri ( ices , hastened to be partakers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game of discus called them forth , not setting by the honours of their fathers , but liking the glory of the Grecians best of all . " ( II Maccabees 4 , 14-15 . ) Undoubtedly the assimilation process operated very powerfully in the sphere of secular music , especially as the Jews had not previously developed and cultivated the art of music to any great extent outside their religion . In the days of the Maccabees , after the achievement of political and cultural autonomy , the music of the temple service was cultivated still further ( i.e. , from the middle of the second down to perhaps the middle of the first century , B.c . ) . But as the Roman influence increased the Jewish national traditions tended to decline . And there was a corresponding decline in certain features of the temple cult , especially its characteristic splendour . When the Jews suffered national catastrophe and the destruction of the Temple , in 70 C.E. , little of the musical tradition was left for the jealous and faithful guardians of the national traditions and the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national existence these musical traditions had suffered seriously and the heritage had been impoverished . They confined themselves to the task of saving and preserving the spiritual heritage and a few musical usages for the next and for the corning generations , for those who ever since , down to the present day , have had to forgo all the splendours of the Jerusalem temple service in the manner of king David and king Solomon . After that August of 70 C.E. , or , in the Jewish calendar , Ab 10 ( or Ab 9 ) , 3830 , when the service of sacrifice came to an end in the Temple at Jerusalem , all musical contributions to Jewish religious ritual also came to an end for many centuries . That date is an outstanding landmark in the history of Jewish music , which inevitably suffered the decline and decay experienced by Jewish national life as a whole . // THE SYNAGOGAL SERVICE AND JEWISH MUSIC FROM THE FIRST TO THE TWENTIETH CENTURY C.E. CHAPTER VIII THE JEWS IN PALESTINE AND BABYLON ( 73-1099 C.E. ) WITH this latest destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jews were denied all possibility of organising themselves on a political basis . This time the consequences were more serious than those that followed the deportation to Babylon in the sixth century B.C. Their first task was to recover from this disaster and to rebuild their own existence . But it was not long before they realised that they could still concentrate their forces in the sphere of their religion and the teaching of the Law . Great changes occurred in their religious life . The service of sacrifice , which had always been the central feature of the temple worship , was replaced by prayers and devotions . So long as the service of sacrifice and the Cult were still observed in the Temple at Jerusalem , prayers and devotions had been only attendant phenomena , performed mainly through the intermediary of the Levites . The devotions and prayers which , as we saw in chapter five , had been observed in the earlier synagogues ? where they had been subsidiary to the study of the Torah ? were now incorporated in the sacred service which took the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service and prayers was drawn up , mainly under the guidance of Gamaliel II in the Academy at Jabneh . In the second century C.E. , the Jewish sacred writings also were given their final form , in twenty-four books , as we have them to-day . At first the Romans tolerated this continuation of Jewish religious life in a changed form , in its new and healthy development . But when they decided to rebuild Jerusalem as a Roman city and planned to erect a temple in honour of the Capitoline Jupiter in the place where the Jewish Temple had stood , in 132 C.E. the Jews revolted in one final struggle for freedom . The movement was led by Bar Kochba , who was influenced by Rabbi // Akiba . It met with success at first , but was swiftly suppressed . Henceforth , the Jews were forbidden to practise their religious ordinances and , under the Emperor Hadrian , 135-138 C.E. , were punished with death if they defied the ban . About this same time the Pauline-Christians , followers of the Apostle Paul , and the Judaeo-Christians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke away more and more from the main body of Jews . But as both these groups had sprung directly from the Jews and at first had only gradually become estranged from their origins , both groups took almost all the Jewish ritual and other usages into the service of their own religion . In this way the early Christians also took over the musical aspect of the Jewish religious service , out of which they later developed their own liturgical music , which continued to be based on the Jewish manner of vocal performance . The realisation of this connection has led of recent years to the investigation of early Christian music , such as the Gregorian plainsong , and its comparison with the surviving Jewish traditional religious melodies ( above all , the so-called tropes ' ) and to tracing their affinity . These researches , in which the Jewish musicologist Idelsohn was especially active , have furthered the endeavour to establish the many old , traditional Jewish melodies , and especially to determine the manner in which the scriptures were rendered in the ancient Jewish religious service . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After Hadrian there were great fluctuations in the Romans ' toleration of Jewish religious life . The Jewish law was expounded from Galilee , and during this period the oral teaching on the law , // and the prescriptions , halakhoth , as established by generations of Soferim and Tannaim ( scribes and teachers ) , were assembled , ordered , and committed to writing , under the supervision of Rabbi Jehuda ha-Nassi ( about the end of the second century c.E . ) . The resulting collection , called the Mishnah , provides some details of the sacred service of the time ; and from that service all present-day Jewish religious services have developed . This collection of rabbinical writings also contains some details of Jewish music . Though the various references consist more of opinions and interpretations relating to Biblical times and to the days of the first and second temples than of descriptions of contemporary musical life , a certain amount also applies to the time in which the Talmud and these various writings came into being , or when they were first committed to writing . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , concerned with the early centuries of the Common Era , although there is some reference to the period immediately preceding . The most important of these references is to the musical instrument called the magrephah , ' which is usually taken to be a pipe organ , and which is not met with previously . The Mishnah , which was completed at the beginning of the third century c.E. , describes the magrephah as a very complex musical instrument , and one which could be heard over a great distance ( e.g. , Mishnah Tamid 5 , 6 ; B. Arakhin lob ) . But in the Mishnah Tamid 3 , 8 , and the Jerusalem Talmud , Sukkah 5 , 1 , we find it stated that this latter quality applied not only to the magrephah ; for the singing , the sound of the shofar , the chalil , and the tziltzal were all so loud that from Jerusalem they could be heard in Jericho . The magrephah , which was said to be capable of producing a thousand different tones , does not appear to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated that the Temple had no such provision . Besides the magrephah , we find mention of various musical instruments which we have already met with in earlier times . The chalil is referred to as an instrument indispensable in funeral rites , and even a poor man would hire at least two chalil players for the funeral of his wife . ( Ketubot 4 , 4 . ) THE MUSIC OF THE JEWS After the destruction of the Temple the rabbis laid it down that to emphasise the national mourning for the loss of state independence and even more of the right freely to celebrate their own temple service , music was to be banned in the synagogue service , and even outside it . This interdiction had important consequences , especially for instrumental music . Even in earlier times secular music had frequently suffered condemnation , and now this was even more the case . As the result , during this period music , which formerly had been a highly important clement in the religious service , was dropped from it altogether . Only much later was an exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , when studying the Scriptures and the Mishnah it was customary to cantillate the passages read for this facilitated memorisation of the text . ' Meanwhile , the Cantor was becoming an increasingly important person in the synagogue . Gradually the position was reached in which he had to provide the main part of the musical element in the sacred service , for which in the days of the Temple a large musical staff had been available . Now his services alone had to suffice , and he took over more and more of the functions of the former priests . The Babylonian Talmud gives a description of the qualities demanded of a cantor . He had to be an educated man , modest , acceptable to the people , skilled in chanting , with a pleasant voice , versed in the Scriptures , the Mishnah , the Talmud , etc.2 The Talmud and the rabbinical writings contain many passages discussing musical practice in the temple service . The opinions expressed differ as to whether instrumental or vocal music played the predominant part , but the view that the instruments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevail.3 Sukkah 51a , b gives us an impressive picture : Men of piety and good deeds used to dance before them with lighted torches in their hands , and sing songs and praises . And Levites without number with harps , lyres , cymbals , and trumpets and other musical instruments were there upon the fifteen steps THE J E W S I N P A L E S T I N E A N D B A B Y L O N leading down from the Court of the Israelites to the Court of the Women , corresponding to the fifteen songs of Ascents ( A.V. " degrees " ) in the Psalms . It was upon these steps that the Levites stood with their instruments of music and sang their songs . ' ' This description refers , of course , to the former musical practice in the Temple , which no longer existed at the time the passage was committed to writing . Each synagogue , ' in Hebrew called Bet Keneset ' or House of Assembly , managed its own affairs , in which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the synagogue . ' Beside him there was the Chazzan , ' who had the task of ensuring order during divine service and taking the rolls of the Torah from their chest to read them to the congregation . In addition there was a Cantor , ' the plenipotentiary of the Community ' ( sheliach tzibbur ) , who was the precentor of the synagogue . Later on the term chazzan ' came to be used for the precentor , and to-day chazzan ' and cantor ' are used indifferently . The Shammash ' ( beadle ) was the servant of the synagogue , roughly corresponding to the verger of the Christian church . While the cantor was reading or singing the prayers and the psalms he stood at the bar where the rolls of the Torah are kept , usually turning his face towards Jerusalem . After the destruction of the second temple and the final suspension of the service of sacrifice a new synagogue service had to be drawn up , based on the previous practices . For this purpose the practices of the communities in the Diaspora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had always had to worship without regard to the Services of the temple and the sacrifice , were drawn upon , as well as certain traditional rites , prayers , and psalms which could be taken from the forbidden services . Moreover , new religious poems were written and added to the service . These new forms of service were centred in the synagogue , which had survived , especially since Ezra 's time , chiefly as a kind of school for instruction in the Torah , as a centre for public reading of the Torah , and for devotions . One new factor in regard to the synagogue service was of importance : unlike the temple service , which could be celebrated only at Jerusalem , it could THE MUSIC OF THE JEWS be practised wherever there was a Jewish community . Now the rendering of the psalms ( which , as we know from the continuity of tradition , were chiefly sung ) and the reading of the Torah ( which also had a specific musical rendering which we shall discuss in the next chapter ) became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief vehicle for preserving the traditional Jewish religious melodies for future generations . At some time after the talmudic period , probably in the fifth century , a new artistic movement appeared . A number of poytanim or paytanim , ' chazzanim by profession , composed poetical pieces which were introduced into the traditional services of special Sabbaths and other outstanding days in the calendar , and particularly of the high holy days . These pieces , the piyyutim , were remarkable for their intense religious fervour and rich , often extremely difficult , language , spiced with recondite literary allusions in the taste of the time . Many piyyutim are still used in the synagogue services to-day . Some of these are sung , and it is likely that special melodies went with the various poems from the outset , though many piyyutim are not sufficiently rhythmical for this purpose . The most important paytanim were Yose ben Yose , Hannai , and Eleazar ha-Kalir . We know nothing of their date or circumstances of life , but it is agreed to-day that they all worked in Palestine before 800 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piyyut flourished again in Italy and Germany , to some extent also in France ( where Rashi was no mean paytan ) and Spain . In the latter country , outstanding poetry in this genre was composed by Isaac Ibn Gayyat ( 1038-89 ) and Solomon Ibn Gabirol ( 1020-57 ) . The latter , however , is much more remembered for his poems in Arabic metre and manner and pure Biblical language . This latter genre was introduced to Spain by Dunash ben Labrat ( about 1000 c.E. ) , who may actually have been its inventor , and within a short time it displaced the piyyut altogether , even in the synagogue . A late representative of the paytanim was Israel Najara ( 1542-1619 ) in Palestine and Syria , who wrote poems ' of deep religious fervour to worldly , often non-Jewish , melodies . THE J E W S I N P A L E S T I N E AND B A B Y L O N His song Yah Ribbon is still sung during Sabbath meals . It is written in Aramaic , and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement initiated by Isaac Luria ( 1534-72 ) . This intense emotional tendency produced a revival of Jewish song , the last echoes of which can be discerned in the chasidic nigunim of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries . At the beginning of the fourth century Constantine the Great elevated Christianity to the status of a state religion , with the result that the Christian church was able to assert its viewpoint in every sphere , including that of culture , with all the resources of state power , and could suppress all opposition by resort to force . As the Jews were dependent on their rulers and governors in the matter of religious practice , and those rulers were now rarely able to oppose the demands of the church , they were allowed no freedom of worship . Meanwhile , the Jewish community in Babylon was under Persian rule , and enjoyed extensive autonomy in many respects , so that it now acquired especial importance , producing a version of the Talmud much fuller than that of Jerusalem . However , the Christian Church dominated Palestine for only some three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the country remained in the hands of the Mohammedans until 1099 , when the Crusaders took the city . During this period all Persia , Syria , Palestine , Egypt , and the Byzantine provinces of Africa , all the lands in which there were considerable Jewish communities , were united under the rule of the Caliphate . This comparatively peaceful era was very favourable to the development of industries , art , and science ; and the Arab culture greatly influenced the Jews . Indeed , Jews gradually adopted Arabic , employing it in their literature instead of the Aramaic which had been the everyday language . With the slow dissolution of the Caliphate of Bagdad the Jewish community in Babylon also declined in power . Towards the end of this period , as the oriental period of Jewish history ' was drawing to its close , important Jewish communities were already emerging in Western Europe , first in Spain and then in France and Germany . These centres took over the task of carrying on the spiritual and cultural heritage of their forefathers . // Mediwval Judaeo-Arabic literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely due to the influence of Arabic philosophers and writers . In these treatises the Jewish scholars not only sought to throw new light on the old temple music by fresh exegesis , but , in harmony with contemporary thought , in their philosophical writings they inquired into music 's various psychic , as well as aesthetic and ethical effects . As we know , these discussions did not stimulate fresh musical creation at the time . None the less , they did influence musical practice , though perhaps only later , centuries after , could it have any effect . The renowned Jewish scholar Saadiah ben Joseph ha-Pitomi , known as Saadiah Gaon , who was born in Dilaz , Fayyum , Lower Egypt , in 892 , and died at Sura , Mesopotamia , in 942 , wrote in 933 his Book of Beliefs and Opinions . ' ' In its tenth chapter he investigated the influence of music on the human soul . Saadiah , who is recognised as one of the leading Judaeo-Arabic writers , may have been influenced in his thinking by the Arabic philosopher Al-Kindi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued in later Judaeo-Arabic writings.2 For instance , Se f er ha-Emunot , the Hebrew translation of Saadiah 's work , written by Berakyah ha-Nakdan in the last quarter of the twelfth century ; and Yuhanan ibn al-Bitriq 's ' Kitab al-Siyasah . ' There is a document dating from the twelfth century which is interesting because of its references to contemporary Jewish musical practices . This is the polemical If ham al-Yahud , written by Samuel ben Yehuda ibn Abun , of Fez , a convert to Islam , who had the pen-name of Samau'al ibn Yahya al-Maghribi . He wrote that Islam had placed the Jews under the rule of the Persians , and that the Persians had frequently forbidden the Jews to practise their forms of devotion . But when the Jews saw that the Persians were in earnest in regard to the interdiction of their worship , they drew up prayers into which they intercalated parts of the customary prayers , and called them al-hizana ( chazzanut ) . THE JEWS I N PALESTINE AND B A B Y L O N They composed many tunes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer-times , to sing and read them . The difference between the hizana and the enjoined prayer ( salat ) is that the enjoined prayer is rendered without a tune ; it is read by the synagogue reader alone and no one accompanies him ; but during the hizana many accompany him with shouting and singing , and help him in the tune . ' ' This relation , which has more than a touch of malice in it and at times is self-contradictory , none the less clearly shows that at this time singing was an essential part of the service . Much earlier St. Hieronymus ( circa 330-420 ) , who knew the Jewish service of Palestine , relates that in their worship the Jews have a solemn singing of psalms , namely , the group of the Songs of Praise ' ( Hallel ? Psalms 113-118 ) . Singing was a prominent feature of other ceremonies of a religious nature , as we learn from Nathan ha-Babli , a Babylonian Jewish savant who went to live in Africa about 950 C.E. On his arrival he reported to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including the ceremony of institution ' into the office of Exilarch . The Exilarch , or , in Aramaic , Resh Galuta , was the head of the community in the Diaspora . He relates that in this ceremony a choir , of noble youngsters , endowed with musical voices , ' took their places , the chazzan ( cantor ) of the synagogue struck up the devotional hymn , and the choir of youngsters joined in , accompanying him . . . . The chazzan , dressed in his prayer vestments , with his face turned to the podium , said special forms of prayer appointed for the initiation of the Exilarch , and the choir of youngsters joined in with a loud Amen . . . . When the Exilarch left the synagogue the people went before and behind him , extolling him in songs of praise , conducting him to his house . ' Without going into the question further , we can accept that throughout the period immediately following the destruction of the Temple there was a continuous tradition of vocal music as a prominent feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the traditional tunes for the Psalms and prayers and reading of the Torah were passed down from generation to THE MUSIC OF THE JEWS generation of worshippers in the synagogues and religious students in Chedarim and Yeshivot . But the ban on instrumental music meant that the then existing musical tradition was lost for the Jews . The vocal tradition alone remained . It represented the only form of musical expression in the service , and we can assume that it gained in importance and was further developed . loo CHAPTER IX THE BIBLICAL ACCENTS ( The Teamim Accents and Neginot Tropes ) THE text of the Jewish Scriptures is annotated with signs known as the biblical accents . In Hebrew they are called teamim . These signs indicate the accent of the words , the manner of rendering the word or phrase , and the tune to which the passage in question is to be cantillated . We must explain that from very early times it has been the tradition not simply to read the Jewish Scriptures , but to render them with high , pausing , vibrating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say when this manner of reading the Scriptures first came into use . The tunes or melodic phrases which these teamim designate are customarily called neginot ( = melodies ) or tropes ' ( from the Greek tropos , a turn , or figure ) . It is generally accepted by authorities that the original and primary function of the biblical accents consisted in ordering single words or phrases in the scriptural passage according to their grammatical and syntactic homogeneity . It is also thought that they may have indicated the manner of interpretation of the text ( hermeneutics ) . At some stage in Jewish musical development these accents came to be used as expression marks in the musical sense , as well as for the functions just mentioned ; but there is no means of telling whether this was prior to , simultaneously with , or later than their original and primary functions . The use of the Greek term , trope , for the neginot might indicate that the accents denoted the musical and declamatory rendering . But the term could also have been adopted from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one authority suggests.2 Nor do we know exactly when the biblical accents the THE MUSIC OF THE JEWS teamim , were first brought into use , though it is believed to have been during the period 500-800 C.E.I The first known system of Hebrew musical accentuation is developed in Asher 's Diqduqe ha- l'camirn.2 Before the days of modern research the introduction of teamim was ascribed to Ezra and his contemporaries . The stimulus to the use of biblical accents , as well as the actual signs and their signification came from the philologists of the Mediterranean culture . But the signs had to be adapted to the special requirements of Hebrew , and so were altered or reformed . To-day it is no longer considered that they were of Jewish origin ; but what they indicate , namely , the manner of rendering and the tune to be used , was almost exclusively specific to the Torah , and so is peculiar to the Jews . The biblical accents have been classified in three systems : 1 . The Tiberian system , in which the signs used are dots , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes below the consonants . 2 . The Babylonian system , in which the signs consist mainly of Hebrew letters , set above the consonants . 3 . The Palestinian system , in which the sign is usually a dot set by the upper or lower part of a consonant . THE BIBLICAL ACCENTS In addition there are two kinds of accents , one for the Books of Psalms , Proverbs , and Job , and the other for all the other books . Accentuation marks were also often employed in nonbiblical Jewish writings . From earliest days there were separating accents , indicating a break , or caesura in the passage , and conjunctive accents , binding two words or a group of words together . All these characteristic features make for easier understanding and greater clarification of the text . Many of the accents are interdependent : certain accents can follow only certain other accents ; and so accents often logically interlock in entire groups . All the accents have names , some of them have several , and the majority of these names are Aramaic in origin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syntactic , and hermeneutic functions , the accents determine the nature of the musical rendering . So they have always been of supreme importance in the preservation of the Jewish musical manner of execution . Without discussing their other functions , we must explain that they indicate how the recitative or melody to which the words are set is to be rendered . Each accent has its traditional musical rendering , without precisely establishing the melody in its rhythm or its tonal intervals . Like the mediæval neumes , the accents indicate musical motifs or phrases ; but , unlike the neumes , they do not represent the melody in any way graphically . As they provide no graphic aid to the rendering , the executant has always had to learn by heart the traditional neginot , or tropes . But as the melodic line is not precisely fixed , the executant has always been free to introduce variations and to adapt the rendering to the musical language of his particular environment . We know that the custom of reading the Torah to neginot melodies is very ancient , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded in former times , for many centuries of foreign influence have left their mark on all these melodies . Johann Reuchlin , the German fifteenth-century humanist , published a tablature , De Accentibus , ' at Hanau in 1518 , which contained the first musical notation of the biblical accents . It includes a transcription of the melody in the tenor , as was customary at the time . It is here reproduced ( notation runs from right to left ) and is followed by a transcription into modern notation . 103 To-day we customarily distinguish two separate groups of neginot ? the oriental and the European . The neginot sung by the oriental Jews have always retained more peculiarities of the // oriental peoples , above all , of the Arabs ; whereas the neginot of the European Jews have been modified in many respects in accordance with European musical tastes . We are unable to say which of these two groups is the more ancient , and which has departed less from the originals . But the neginot are properly the oldest existing melodies and groups of motifs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of teamim . Undoubtedly the neginot , which perhaps convey to us some idea of what the temple music sounded like , originally differed very little from the music of their environment . And although in the course of the centuries they have necessarily undergone many changes ? adaptations to the new times and the temporary environmental conditions , adaptations to foreign tonal systems , embellishment or simplification ? they have always reflected Jewish experience first and foremost , and above all have conveyed the musical expression peculiar to the Jews , simply because of the fact that they are used only in association with the Hebrew text . The constant Jewish conservatism in regard to the liturgy hindered development of the neginot and ensured that the rendering of the Torah should always appear traditional , and archaic , even when it revealed traces of assimilation influences . The majority of the neginot are restricted to a narrow tonal range and consist of short phrases , frequently reminiscent of the pentatonic scales of the ancient Chinese , Irish , Scottish , and other peoples . It will be remembered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pentatonic whole-tone scale . Recognising that the biblical accents are of exceptional significance to Jewish music , both in the past and in the future , the Jewish musicologist , Idelsohn , studied the various melodies of the accents as they have survived till modem times , and compared them , drawing on the main Jewish centres of Europe , Asia Minor , and Egypt for his material . The comparative tables reproduced on the two following pages are taken from his Thesaurus of HebrewOriental Melodies , ' vol. 2 , pp. 44-45 . They clearly show the affinity of the accents and neginot used in the various centres , and that in each case the pentatonic character of the tunes is either partly or wholly retained . These tables justify two deductions : first , that the majority of the accents known to us to-day from various Jewish centres are // musically related to one another , and so they must stem from a single prototype . Secondly , that their present-day differences can be ascribed to the variations in development arising from differingg environments . Robert Lachmann ( on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in all Oriental-Sephardic communities , the cantillation of the Jews in Djerba resembles the Arab music in its tone relation and in its melody , and he has no doubt that it assimilated traces of Andalusian music of Tunisian stamp . Assuming such a tendency , or impossibility to resist a certain amount of assimilation of the music and musical expression of the environment , the resemblance of the musical patterns of different and distant Jewish communities in their accent motifs , as , for instance , demonstrated by Idelsohn ( here on p.1Q6-107 ) , are the more striking . It must also be accepted that in their musical aspect the biblical accents originally differed little or not at all from the music of the surrounding world ; yet , as they developed in conjunction with the Hebrew texts , they gradually acquired a characteristically Jewish expression . As the Jews always strove to retain the original , the traditional nature and form , the neginot melodies also retained their Jewish musical characteristics . It is noteworthy that the music of the surrounding world had a more circumscribed influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melos of Jewish folksong , and even on the religious songs . One has only to listen to the reading of the Torah ( the leinen , ' as Ashkenazi Jews call it ) in the synagogal service to have this impression confirmed ; the leinen ' unquestionably consists of musical phrases derived from the distant past . An example is given on page 109 . In modern times various transcriptions have been made of the neginot into modern notation . But in all such cases we have to remember that present-day notation is concerned only with the music and its performance , without being able to lay down precisely the interpretation , and often not even the exact rhythm . But that is precisely what the neginot achieve . So it is true that we can get some idea of them through their transcription into modern notation , but the only way to learn thoroughly the neginot in use to-day is to listen to the skilled interpreters . A great deal of research has been done on the Biblical accents of recent years , the best known being that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years to collecting examples and investigating and elucidating the entire subject . Another name that should be mentioned in this connection is Salomon Rosowsky , In his publication The Cantillation of the Bible ( The Five Books of Moses ) ' 1 analyses the Lithuanian type of cantillation , which he considers as the principal type of the Ashkenazic cantillation , also outside of Lithuania . His finding that this type of cantillation can easily be written down in the modern system of twelve semi-tones within an octave , whereas the cantillation of Oriental Jews requires special adjustment in our musical notation , in regard to intervals and pitches which often differ from those of Western scales , is significant . He also believes that the law of assimilation of the Jewish cantillation has been recognised and formulated.2 As a large number of neginot have been notated of recent years , we give only a few examples . There are innumerable variations . Comparative studies with Gregorian Chant , as made by Idelsohn , and by Eric Werner , have revealed many interesting facts . As in the musical example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the musical motifs can be recognised as very simi lar or , at least , related to each other . It must be pointed out , however , that even where the Gregorian Chant might in musical respects appear similar to a Jewish melody or cantillation , the effect varies according to the different tradition and interpreta tion . Comparative research is thus of great value for musicolo gists ; but for the creation of true Jewish music only those neginot can be used which are preserved by Jewish tradition . The great value of the neginot as material for musical motifs and musical elaboration has been fully realised by modern Jewish composers , and they frequently draw upon them for both religious and secular compositions . // DURING THE DISPERSAL IN EUROPE ( Twelfth to eighteenth centuries ) BETWEEN the twelfth and eighteenth centuries the Jews living in Europe experienced many vicissitudes . They knew periods of peace and happiness , but far more often they had to suffer persecution . Yet during these many years they absorbed first the highly developed Arab , and then European culture , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution in their manner of expression , for they adapted all their receptive and expressive powers in literature and music to the tradition of the European countries in which they resided . This adaptation could be only partially successful , for their own specific culture and sensibilities were still too highly charged to allow them to take over essentially alien forms of expression without modification . On the other hand , this different , European form of culture provided fresh stimuhis to their oriental imagination . With the aid of these stimuli , in time they developed a new form of expression which was similar to that of Europe . On the other hand , during these six centuries European music was slowly evolving , and so the Jews in Europe had comparatively little difficulty in acclimatising themselves to the musical atmosphere . As one would expect , it was the neginot that suffered least adaptation , and so it was in this sphere that the original Jewish style was most retained . Whenever the Jews were allowed to live in peaceable , satisfactory relations with their milieu , in Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or anywhere else , they opened their eyes and ears to the arts and science of the land of their sojourn . Even Jewish conservative circles were not proof against the influence of non-Jewish culture , in so far as it affected them through their fellow Jews who concerned themselves with that culture . It must have left even stronger traces and influenced their cultural development in every respect when they were compulsorily converted to Christianity , for this necessarily involved contact with the Christian religion and its religious ceremonial , ill THE MUSIC OF THE JEWS and their acceptance as a rule of the speech and non-religious culture of their environment . In fact , all the Jewish melodies that have survived reveal the influence of alien musical tastes , and , of course , especially those of the peoples among whom they have lived . All musical taste , Jewish or non-Jewish , is continually subjected to the modifications resulting from musical developments . There is a class of Spanish song which is still sung to-day by the descendants of the Jews who were expelled from Spain at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only preserved by them . Yet even these songs are sung in different versions in the various centres of these Sefardic ' or Spanish Jews , and this applies to songs which they adapted from their Spanish environment . How much more must this have applied to the truly Jewish songs , songs which they themselves composed and sang in a manner of expression in genuine conformity with the times . Even the Jewish songs were always modified by the taste of the age , though as a rule the adaptation was too slow . On the other hand , it seems that Jewish music developed simultaneously with that of the environment , keeping pace with the general evolution of the tonal structure ; in Germanic and Slavonic countries especially the Jews gradually modified their songs as they , like their milieu , carried through the development from the old tonal systems to the modem major and minor modes , from homophony to polyphony , and so on to the modern chord and harmonic system . A significant and typical phenomenon of these times was that of the Christian crypto-Jews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renounce their Jewish faith . These compulsorily converted Jews continued to observe Jewish religious practices in secret and took the first opportunity to renew their open confession of Jewry , and they must have brought alien elements into the secret Jewish religious assemblies and even the synagogue service . As their Jewish service was mercilessly suppressed by the Christians , they tried to avoid offending their persecutors by employing well-known non-Jewish tunes , so that at least their singing would not betray them . It is impossible to estimate the extent to which these often popular and banal tunes were introduced into and preserved in the Jewish sacred service . But in this and other ways , from the eleventh century onward // Jewry was continually absorbing new , European musical elements , faithfully preserving them , and through habituation coming at last to regard them as its own . This , of course , is not a unique phenomenon ; it is found wherever cultural peoples come into contact with one another . In those difficult times the synagogue service must have been extremely simple . The singing of psalms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all religious and other communal occasions . They occupied much of the time ; in the Orient it is recorded that their rendering lasted more than an hour ( this was circa 1200 ) . Prayers for special occasions , or relating to the unhappy contemporary national history , were the most important innovations in the liturgy . These prayers and lamentations , usually written in poetic form , and frequently sung , varied from one Jewish community to another , since they were usually related to the experience of the community . We do not know the origin of the new tunes to which they were set ; we have to assume that , in so far as new prayers were not sung to old tunes , but to new ones specially composed , these new tunes were borrowed from the non-Jewish environment or at least were strongly influenced by it . In the course of time these circumstances brought about great variations in the rites of the various communities , especially as they each had their own traditions and had little contact with one another , and also as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head who decided the choice of tunes for the services . Two main groups are to be distinguished in the Jewish rite : the Oriental and Spanish , called Sefardic , and the Palestinian and Germanic , called Ashkenazi . The territorial area of the first group covered Spain and the Islamic countries , that of the second covered the other Christian countries , especially those with Teutonic and later with Slavonic populations . Despite the comparative simplicity of the synagogue service singing played an increasingly important part in it . The precentor 's task was by his emotional singing to maintain the community in piety and devotion , or to stimulate these feelings . Often he exploited his customary liberty in order to give public performances of his own skill , to demonstrate his vocal power or his gift for composition . That such performances were not always // called for we can tell from the frequent complaints about such practices . But even the various religious trends and groups that sprang up among the Jews , such as the German mystics of the thirteenth century , the Cabbalistic movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the eighteenth and nineteenth century , etc. , did a great deal to further Jewish religious song by their intensive practice of hymn- and psalm-singing . Judah the Pious , in the thirteenth century , recommended the use of pleasing and well-sounding tunes in prayers , tunes that contributed to the conceutratiou and exaltation of devotion , tunes that moved the heart to tears or to outbursts of joy . Imanuel Romi , who lived about 1300 c.i. , thus extolled his own gift of song : When I say the great Kedushah , a Yotzer , or the Kerobah , then the hardest will be melted ; when I pray on Yom Kippur ( the Day of Atonement ) or read the Megillah during Purim , execute an En Kamochah for the pilgrimage festival , or a psalm , then the mighty tremble at my voice ; and when I bring the laments to the ear , then not one eye is left without tears . ' ' The tunes to which the various prayers were to be sung were handed down at first in script , but later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be specific in regard to any individual tune , we know that they originated from various sources , for the comparative method of research has revealed traces of the folk song and minnelieder of many lands . Christian church music also appears to have been drawn upon . The synagogue precentors , the cantors , ' made use of any tune that suited them , without reference to its source and character . Complaints were openly made that profane tunes were being used in the Jewish sacred service , just as we find complaints in ecclesiastical writers in regard to Christian church music . But , generally speaking , the tunes adopted were either used in conjunction with new prayers , or certain of their motifs were employed in the creation of new tunes . Each community had a permanent repertoire of old and new tunes , clearly distinguished from that of every other community . Of course , the recommendation of Rabbi DURING THE D I S P E R S A L I N E U R O P E Jacob Levi Molln ( called Maharil ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its customary tunes and not drop them in favour of new ones was often followed ; but as such calls were frequent , obviously they must have been ignored frequently . Apparently in Germany and Portugal the Jews were strict in regard to this question , but in Poland the cantors gave free reign to their imagination , and were allowed to improvise . Not seldom the cantor developed his vocal performance greatly to the detriment of the prayers , for , especially if he was untrained , he sang without regard to the meaning of the words , only in order to demonstrate his vocal technique . In 1587 , the Hebrew poet , composer , and singer , Israel Moses Najara ( sometimes called Nagara , or Nadjara ) , I published in Safed his Zemiroth Yisrael ' ( Songs of Israel ) which is considered the first such publication in the Orient . Later , in Venice , the edition was enlarged ( 1599-1600 ) . His religious poetry is still in use , e.g. Yah ribbon olam ' ( God of the World ) , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invented melodies or adapted tunes of Arab , Greek , Turkish , or Spanish origin , adjusting them to fit the Hebrew text and the traditional style of Jewish singing . With few exceptions , singing in the synagogue was originally confined to soloists . As time passed the custom grew of reinforcing the cantor with other singers , usually not more than two , one with a high , the other with a low voice ; these two partly accompanied the cantor and partly sang the responses . So far as we know , the first synagogue singing which made use of a number of voices , singing with some pretensions to artistry , was in Italy . We do not know how far this artistic manner of singing spread , but in any case the innovation , which clearly was a pure imitation of contemporary non-Jewish music , met with energetic opposition . We possess a collection of works written for such part-singing , composed by Salomone Rossi , called Ii Ebreo , ' who was born in Mantua about 1570 and died in 1628 . He published music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translation of the Hebrew title of the book reads : Solomon 's Songs , Psalms , THE MUSIC OF THE JEWS Hymns , and Temple-songs , composed in accordance with the rules of music for three , four , five , six , seven , and eight voices by Salomon Mehaadumin , a citizen of Mantua . ' The work was printed by Pietro and Lorenzo Bragadini in the Printing Office of Giovanni Caliumi , in Venice , in 1623 ( 1620 ? ) and bore the following dedication : To the noble , magnanimous , Moses Sullam of Mantua , who conjoins erudition with greatness : Since that day when the Lord granted me the favour of opening my ear to music , the first and noblest of the arts , and permitted me to understand and to learn it , I have made a firm resolution and have been fortunate in devoting the firstborn of my songs to the glory of the Lord , to praise him with hymns of joy and thanks and to do him honour for the many gifts which he has bestowed upon me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sing new songs which have been written in accordance with the rules of the art , in conformity with the spirit with which he inspired me ; songs suited to the days of festival and joy . I have subjected a large number of the Psalms of David to the laws of music , in order to make them more attractive . After I had finished my work I was of the opinion that it would be well to make a selection and to publish these , not to my own glory , but to the glory of the Lord , who of His grace gave me this life and whom I shall always praise . . . The introduction was written by Juda Leone da Modena , the chief rabbi of the Republic of Venice , at whose suggestion the work was published . It reads : Judah Aryeh ( Leone ) da Modena , son of Isaac , to all whose ears can understand the truth : One knows the words of the poet : " The Lip of Truth shall be established for ever . " Music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the land of the Hebrews . " The savants have flourished like grass and have disseminated knowledge , and have been admired by all other nations , for they have mounted up like eagles into immeasurable // heights with wings . From the Hebrews is the music of other nations borrowed . Who could forget King David , who , as it is written , instructed the sons of Asaph , Heman , and Jeduthun in music ? He made them understand singing and the playing of instruments during the periods of the first and second Temple . But our exile , our dispersion over the earth , our troubles and persecutions have made them forget knowledge and lose understanding of art . The wrath of God descended upon the people and he cast them into a pit void of all knowledge . We had to borrow our wisdom from other nations , until now Salomon alone is excellent in this science and wiser than any man of our own people , through which he was taken into the service of the Dukes of Mantua . Nay , his musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciation , as they were liked by non-Jews . The Lord opened the eyes of the blind . Despite the opposition of his brethren , he sought to perfect the work . His power is unto his God . IIe added every day to the psalms , hymns , and Temple-songs till he brought them together in one volume . Now the people sang his compositions ; they were pleased by their excellence and their ears were delighted by them . The leaders of the community , headed by the most reverend and virtuous Moses Sullam ( whom may God guard ) , urged the author and persuaded him to publish his compositions . I , too , who am proud to be reckoned among his admirers , brought all my influence to bear to persuade him to occasion this publication . Finally , he submitted to our requests and gave his collection to be printed . He commissioned me to supervise the printing of the book , to see it through the press and to eliminate errors . . . . The reader will see that the author preferred the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our Hebrew custom , rather than change the musical notation . He did not consider it necessary to print the vowel signs , since our singers know the text by heart and read correctly without them , which does them great honour . ' THE MUSIC OF THE JEWS Ye are blessed , my brethren , because we have begun the publication of the work of the outstanding musician who composed songs in his sanctuaries on holy-days . Teach them to your children , that they may be instructed in music , as was the custom among the Levites . I am convinced that from the moment of its appearance this work will spread the taste for good music in Israel , to praise the Lord . Among us people were to be found ? of this there is no doubt those who infallibly resist all progress and who will also resist these songs which are beyond their understanding . I therefore consider it advisable to refer to the answer to a question put to me when I was still Rabbi at Ferrara ; all the great scholars of Venice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Talmud which can be cited against the introduction of choir-singing into our Temples ; and that was sufficient to close the malevolent mouths of the opponents . Despite all they can say , I put all my trust in the honour and nurture of song and music in our synagogues , to extend these things and to make use of them , until the wrath of God is turned away from us and He builds His Temple again in Zion , and commands the Levites to perform their music , and all singing will be happy and joyful again , not as it is to-day , when we sing with heavy hearts and in anguish of spirit for the pain of our dispersion . ' In this introduction wre have a clear picture of the status and conditions of the contemporary synagogal vocal music . It is obvious that in Italy there was a group of Jews who either as composers or as musically trained amateurs knew the welldeveloped art of Italian music and desired to raise synagogue music to the same level . But there were two conflicting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the developed style of contemporary secular madrigals ( Rossi was a composer D U R I N G THE D I S P E R S A L 1N E U R O P E of madrigals ) and an opposition group which resisted such an alien modification of synagogal singing . Moreover , it appears that Rossi did not make use of any traditional melodies in his compositions , but composed quite freely ; though , as his religious songs were clearly differentiated from his madrigals , this may not be so . In any case it is clear that his synagogal compositions made no appeal to the simple , musically uneducated Jews , and did not achieve great popularity . A new edition of Rossi 's works was edited by Samuel Naumbourg , senior cantor of Paris ( who is also known for his own synagogal compositions ) , together with Vincent d'Indy.1 We shall understand why Rossi 's synagogal works were not generally taken up , and met with no response among the main body of Jews , if we consider the following facts .
