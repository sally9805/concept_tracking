To the swank Lodge at Smugglers ' Notch in Stowe , Vermont , bent on a little weekend schussing , went Freshman Senator Teddy Kennedy , Wife Joan , Attorney General Robert Kennedy , and others near and dear . It was all sparkling fun , until Teddy , in presumably unphotogenic aprs-ski togs , was confronted outside the Smugglers ' Den lounge by Roving Photographer Philip N. Lawson of the Vermont Sunday News . Elections over , the Senator declined to have his picture taken with a roving beauty queen , but Lawson clicked anyway . Bugged by the shutter . Teddy reddened , and the incident swiftly snowballed . Sunday News Publisher William Loeb , a New England Republican long immunized to the Kennedy magic , citing Lawson 's confiscated film and torn camera case , said Teddy should apologize . The Senator , down in Washington presumably busy doing More for Massachusetts , said nothing . <P> Awaiting the outcome of tests for an acute intestinal infection , Protestant Evangelist Billy Graham , 44 , lay bed-bound in Catholic territory-St . Francis Hospital in Honolulu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendance made no attempt to reverse the Diet of Worms . Far from it . Said Sister Maureen , administrative chief of St. Francis : " I think , in the light of the ecumenical movement , that it 's rather nice to have him here . " <P> Obviously built for a wide-awake wardrobe was perpetual Cinema Starlet Jill St. John , 22 , back to the grind in a Paramount peepshow called Who 's Been Sleeping in My Bed ? Whoever it was , it did n't seem to be her husband , hot rodding Five-and-Dime Heir Lance Reventlow , 27 . All Jill wants from Lance these days is separate maintenance . <P> Accompanying each new copy of Columbia University 's scholarly biannual Journal of International Affairs is this terse note from the editors : " We regret that the announced article on ' People to People Diplomacy ' by Sargent Shriver was never received . " <P> " More than Bobo ! " cheered Mrs. Cecil Blaffer Hudson , 43 , and that was what she got-$6.5 million , beating Bobo Rockefeller 's 1954 divorce settlement by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already an heiress to the Humble Oil fortune amassed by her father , Robert Lee Blaffer-but it made the finish of her 17-year marriage to Edward Joseph Hudson , 56 ( Hudson Oil and Gas ) , quite a bit brighter . " I 'm so happy I could sing , " said the ex-Mrs . Hudson as she considered a future sweetened by an estimated $5,000.000 in cash , $1,000,000 in paintings and sculpture , a $500,000 Texas estate , and custody of two children . <P> A sick thing happened on the way to the courtroom , but triple-sick Comedian Lenny Bruce , 37 , was n't laughing . Like he missed the trial . While a Chicago jury was convicting him for an " obscene " nightclub performance , Bruce was being arrested in Los Angeles , charged with possession of narcotics , and released on bail . Still pending : an earlier narcotics rap and three misdemeanors , two for obscenity and one for slugging a TV newsman.                    @
