Making railroads pay has long been one of the toughest challenges a U.S. businessman can face . Last week two executives who have been uncommonly successful in meeting that challenge moved on to new and bigger jobs . Louis W. Menk , 47 , will leave the $100,000-a-year presidency and board chairman ship of the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway Co. to take over as president and chief executive of the Chicago , Burlington &; Quincy Railroad Co. , succeeding Harry C. Murphy , who is retiring at 73 . Jack E. Gilliland , 56 , who has been a vice president of the Frisco since 1958 , will move up to become its president and chairman . <P> Menk got into railroading as a telegraph messenger when he was 19 , be came president of the Frisco in 1962 . By cutting back passenger service and automating freight yards , he raised earnings to an eight-year high of $7,123,356 last year - a performance that won him the attention of Burlington directors . In moving to the larger Burlington ( 8,546 miles of track v. the Frisco 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road 's freight and passenger revenues rose last year , income fell $1,012,306 to $20.3 million , is down another $6,011,000 so far this year . Menk is expected to shake the Burlington up , plans to make heavy use of computers to analyze operations . <P> Those operations may soon become considerably more complex : the Interstate Commerce Commission is now studying a proposed , long-pending merger that , if it approves , would stitch together the Burlington , the Great Northern and the Northern Pacific into the nation 's longest railroad . <P> Gilliland made his own contribution to the Frisco 's good profit picture in the late 1950s , when he coordinated the road 's industry-leading development of two-and three-decker automobile carriers . Last year the Frisco hauled 250,000 cars and trucks on tracks that run through nine states ( but come no closer to San Francisco than Floydada , Texas ) . <P> Like Menk , Gilliland looks to computers as a vital tool for further streamlining operations . The management itself is already streamlined . Frisco executives are young ( average age : 45 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fe when he was only 14 and , despite five years of night school , never earned a college degree . These days most future Frisco executives come to the railroad straight out of college .
