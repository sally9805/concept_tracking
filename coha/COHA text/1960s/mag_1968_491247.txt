Cor a while there were all those towns like Bridge-I ? port . There were so many of them , and they were so alike , that he has forgotten the names of some of them . There was the one in Pennsylvania , and he does n't remember which one it was , but he remembers the cards that stood in front of the sugar bowls on the tables : " You work nights , " he said once , " so what do you do all afternoon in those towns ? You can sit in your hotel room and read Tins WEEK IN SIOUX FALLS . Maybe there 's an annual meeting of the tulip growers . You stand in the lobby and read the list of the churches . You sit in the park , and the pensioners tell you how had the country is today . You walk down the main street and look at the shoes in the window of Thom McAn 's . You go into Woolworth 's , and the girl asks you if you 're an actor . She says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish work , the only place open is the cafeteria with the white-tile walls . " They are the jesters of our time , these nightclub comedians , and although no one bands them like migratory birds . there are something like 2,000 of them traveling this country . Jeremy Vernon is one of them , and he was working the weekend  --  two shows on Friday night and three on Saturday and two on Sunday  --  at a place called Carl Hoppl 's in Baldwin , Long Island . On Monday he would be opening for two weeks  --  two shows a night , seven nights a week  --  with Peggy Lee at the Latin Casino in Cherry Hill , N.J. , and now he was standing just inside the red-plush drapes of one doorway in the main room at Hoppl 's and scanning the crowd . " Do you see what I mean ? " he was saying . " Just look around . " The room holds 560 on two levels , and it was almost filled . There was the blue-gray haze of cigarette smoke and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in front of the five-piece band Dick Roman was singing Night and Day . Around three sides of the stage there were the faces , tilted upward and sallow in the light , and farther back the heads turned away , and in the rear of the room there was the low hum of conversation . " Down there , " he was saying , " there 's a 65 ' Sweet Sixteen ' party , and over there you 've got about thirty middle-aged women , On this side you 've got a hundred firemen , and over there another ' Sweet Sixteen . ' Then upstairs you 've got the Shriners . It 's murder . " He is 33 years old now , and he has been doing this for a dozen years . First it was the amateur nights in Brooklyn . Then it was the small summer hotels in the Catskills and then the cheap joints in the Bronx and Brooklyn and the strip houses in Connecticut and upstate New York . Then it was all those Bridgeport towns and then gradually the better spots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may gross $40,000 . Out of this , though , must comethe 10 percent for his agent , and then his travel expenses and the hotel rooms and the meals and the car rentals . Then there are the fees for the writers and the musical arrangements and the cost of the pictures the agent sends out , and at the end of the year he may end up with $15,000 before Uncle Sam . On the stage Dick Roman was taking a second bow . At the microphone Herb Creager , who leads the band and plays piano and M.C. 's , was leading the applause . .. , and was n't he wonderful ? " Creager was saying . " Dick Roman . . . Just wonderful ! .. And now , the comedy star of our show , who justrecently played the Copacabana , and has appeared at many of the best clubs everywhere . ? Let 's give a real warm welcome to . Jemmy Vernon ! " " Thank you ! Thank your he was saying- and meaning it . because Dick Roman had turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and I hope you mean it . I say that . because in our country today  --  and you 've probably noticed this the same as I have  --  it 's hard to tell what people really mean . I was just out on the West Coast . and I wa$ observing some of those hippies . You know the ones I mean  --  the peaceniks . They walk along . carrying signs reading BAN THE BOMB ! , Sine THE , i1 ; ! lid you ever notice . though , the clothes they 're weat  --  ing ? . That 's light . Army jackets , Navy ixints , ? . and German helmets ! " While 1w had been in San Eianciseo he had gone to one of those peace rallies 1i1 set ' it stitlictlitng would conic out of it for him , and now he could detect just enough of the signs of approval the small laughs and , up close where he could see thrin , the nodding of heads . f " It 's true . " he said . " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was driving through Times Square , and the light turned red . so I stopped . The next thing I knew . the sign said . wALK , So I got out of my car and I started to walk . . . . That 's right .. . . You know , you just ca n't obey some of t h. signs . Did you ever drive over the George hington Bridge ? Well there 's a sign there : . ays. so help me : IN CASE OF ENEMY ATTACK  --  DRIVE OFF THE BRIDGE ! . Well . lotsa luck ! . Sir ? " Just when he was starting to get them moving . he had heard the heckler in the back among the firemen . Everybody gets them , and everybody has the standard put-downs . " I 'm sorry , sir , " he was saying now , and some of the heads in front were turning around . " I 'm sorry , but I work alone . " It is a stock line , and it drew only the few light laughs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine and go right into his impressions of foreign-airlines pilots , with the band backing him . and the whole thing so strong it will roll over just about anybody or anything . " We get to travel a lot in this business . " he said . " Not long ago I was in Europe . entertaining the troops , and .. . " Then he heard him again , bolder this time , the way they always are if you give them that second swing at you . and he could just make him out , a face back in the semidarkness with the firemen . " Look , sir , " he said , and then he gave it just the right pause . " Do I conic where you work  --  and throw wood on the fire ? " It got them . the firemen and all of them . It was the best laugh he had drawn , and now he had them , because a heckler can do that for you , first arouse sympathy for you and then , when you bury him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own stuff is dying , you 're actually hoping for a heckler , anybody , to try you and get you out of it . and now everything was working , and when Herb Creager bowed him off , the hand was strong and sustained . " About seventy-five , " he was saying , after he had conic off , because he rates the response to every performance against 100 . " With these mixed groups you do n't really know who you 're talking to . Its like trying to get the United Nations to agree . You know ? " A half hour later he was upstairs , and again he was standing just inside one of the doorways and looking at the crowd . There must have been about 300 of them , Shriners wearing fezzes and smoking cigars , and out for a big night with their wives . Dick Roman was doing his medley of girl songs . and at the back of the room , on the top of one of the unoccupied tables , somebody 's wife  --  a plump woman in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while somebody else 's wife lighted her act with a candle from one of the tables . Creager gave him the same intro he had downstairs , and the band gave him the same bring-on . As he walked up to the mike , though , there was no applause at all . " Thank you , " he said , but smiling . " Thank you for the big hand . " It was n't really a dying line , because he was n't dead yet , and he does n't go for dying lines anyway . Some of them use them : " Am I keeping you people up ? " .. " I do n't have to do this , but I 'm too nervous to steal . " You can win sympathy with dying lines , but sometimes the audience does n't really know you 're dying , and besides , it is n't sympathy you want . So he led off with the British wedding-night story that a friend told him one day , while they were walking in Central Park and comparing p ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the the English woman with her dog on the and he had ti ? " Save it ! " lie was , 1 , i ! , MIT t he laughter and the applause . " Save It toi later , because I have a weak ending . " Then , with them readied fire it now , he did what he wanted to do . Ile did that foreign-airlines routine that first occurred to him three years ago while he was flying around Europe , playing those Army installations and sitting in those planes and listening to the pilots delivering their spiels in three or four languages . The routine built to a Russian pilot calling off the passenger list of 50 Russian composers in 40 seconds . He has been doing that hit since he was in junior high school , imitating Danny Kaye , who had originally done it in Lady in the Dark , but it is still a minor tour de force . " I do n't know , " he said , when he came off . " Maybe about eighty . It 's tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be so tough that , like all men at some time , he will ask himself why . It is a question he hears from people who seem to understand why a singer sings , but who can not seem to understand why all he wants to do is to make others laugh . " I want acceptance , " he said once . " Does n't everyone ? In this world it 's hard enough to get a few people to really accept you , but when I 'm out there and it 's going right , I have the feeling that I 've got hundreds accepting me at one time . I need it , maybe more than others , because , growing up , I could n't find it . " He was born in Berlin . His mother was English and Jewish and his father a German . Lutheran , and they were divorced when he was a Year and a half old . His mother moved with him to Merano , in the Italian Tyrol , where , for the next three years , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One night , in the middle of the night , his mother awakened him . " Come , " she said . " We are going to America . " His mother dressed him , and they got into a car . He remembers that it was raining , because he remembers the beams from the headlights shining on the wet paving stones . When daylight came , they were on a train , and when they arrived in Genoa , and he looked up at the ship , it was the largest structure he had ever seen . He was seasick all the way across the Atlantic . " New York , " he said . " You can imagine how it was after Merano . I spoke funny . I had funny clothes . I wore short pants , and I had this little cap with earflaps . " For a while I was in a day camp , and on Saturdays they 'd take us up to Tibbetts Brook Park , in Yonkers . I could never catch on to sports , though , and when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for football , but I 'd be there , and somebody would holler . ' Pile on ! ' They 'd all jump on me , and I 'd be on the bottom of the pile . I could n't see , I could n't move , I could n't breathe , and I was terrified . At night I 'd lie in bed and I 'd think : Why do they always pick on me ? Maybe there 's something wrong with me . " On Saturday night at Hoppl 's he did the 10-o'clock show in the downstairs room , and at midnight he was upstairs with the Italian American War Veterans . Then at 1:15 Herb Creager was bringing him on downstairs again . This time there were only about 150 left in the room , but some of them were holdovers from the first show , so he took the mike off its stand , and walking with it , he did what the singers call strolling and the comedians call corny . " Now there 's an interesting foursome over here , " he was saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two fellas take out two girls , and if they 're uncooperative they force'em . " ... " You 're married twenty-six years ? You do have a sense of humor . " " Are you in show business try - Then how come you 've got your foot 1,1. stage ? " ... " So , we 'll have a community ' ' ins . You know , follow the bouncing ball , and you ould you like to be the bouncing ball ? " ? Io n't think I can sing ? Do you know I recoi-ued for I ) ecca ? That 's Sylvia Decca , and she lives in the Bronx and has a tape recorder . . . . " He kepi it up for 27 minutes , and when he came off and walked out between t he tables they were still applauding . He was perspiring a little , and he shook his head . " Sure they liked it , " he said , " but you hate to do it . You do n't get the satisfaction you get from doing your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wit , but when you work out a routine and develop it and perfect it , you 're dealing with humor . We all have to do this now and then , but it 's reaching . " A man 's reach is as long as a man 's life , and it started for him when he was still small and everybody listened to the same comedians on the radio . He would walk around that apartment on West . C3rd Street , mimicking Fred Allen and Henry Morgan , and his mother and her family and her friends thought it was amazing . Then in school the teachers were natural material . " I did imitations of all of them , and the other kids laughed , and it started to get me that acceptance . Then I got to doing Danny Kaye impressions that I took from records . and taking routines I heard the comedians do on the radio . The other kids would say . ' Hey . do So-and-so . ' In high school I used to campaign for the kids running for office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they wanted to advertise a school picnic or a boat ride , I 'd go on for that . " Then I went into the Army , where everybody is leading the same life , so you 've got the greatest audiences in the world . In fact , in the Army the reaction was so tremendous that I thought that when I got out . I 'd be a star in a year . " On Sunday night , when he got to Hoppl 's , the headwaiter was looking for him . The headwaiter took him down between the tables and introduced him to a stocky , dark-haired man . " You 're the comedian ? " the man said . " I 'll tell you what . We 're airline mechanics here . You know ? I mean maybe you could do something . maybe funny , about it ? " " Any special airline ? " he said . " No. " the man said . " All of them . " " Sure , " he said , " I think I can do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for specials . One of them will come over and say . " Listen , there 's a guy named Charley at our table who just divorced his wife and married this young chick . You can do something funny with that . " So you say . " Like what ? " And they say , " Look , you 're the comedian . " Now he was into his airlines routine , just as if it were new material that he had come up with for the occasion , and they were liking it . The Japanese pilot was explaining to the passengers that they would be flying over Honolulu , but that the people in Honolulu did n't know it  --  it was a surprise  --  when the argument started at one of the tables right at his feet . " That 's what you think ! " the middle-aged brunette in the blue dress was saying across the table . " I do n't think it , " the middle-aged brunette in the black dress was saying back . " I know it . " " Ssh ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry , " he said , " but I 'm talking as quietly as I can . " There was a man now , standing at . the table . He had the woman in the black dress by an arm , and she was getting up . " Well , good night ! " said the one in the blue dress . " Drop dead ! " said the one in the black dress , and then the man led her away . He left it alone , because it he tried to use it . the woman still at the table , or her husband , could still be trouble . Instead , he signaled to Herb Creager , and the band started the Russian music , and he did the 50 composers and got off . At 11:05 he got his musical arrangements hack and his check from Creager . At 1:30 the next afternoon he was driving south on the New Jersey Turnpike for the two weeks with Peggy Lee at the Latin Casino in Cherry Hill . " So when I got out of the Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star in a year , I saw a classified ad in Show Business . A guy who gave himself the label ' Broadway Talent Scout ' said he was looking for singers , comedians and dancers for TV and top nightclubs . He had a little office in the old Roseland building with no window and , you know , the walls covered with yellowing photos of acts stuck with adhesive tape and thumbtacks and saying things like , ' Thanks for giving me my start . Tarza and her snake . ' There was this guy wearing a brown flannel shirt and a broad red tie , and he said to me , ' Yeah . we 'll get you some shows , but we 'll have to try you out . We got this talent contest on tonight . ' " He sent me to one of those joints in Brooklyn where you have to take three subways and then walk ten blocks . You had to be there at eighto'clock , and the show did n't go on until ten . and there were nineteen other acts waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were actually amateur contests. and everybody brought his claque  --  relatives and friends and neighbors , " He did Danny Kaye . and then stuck out his- jaw like Barry Fitzgerald and , with a heavy brogue , did the : " Ah , well now . . . . " He did Jerry Lewis screaming , " Hey , Dean ! " He did Bette Davis knocking the movies : " Everybody and everything in Hollywood is typed . When I made the picture , The Letter , even the letter was typed . " The show went on for more than two hours , and when it was over . they paraded the contestants across the stage , and the M.C. held a white envelope over their heads , and what was left of the crowd applauded . There was five dollars in the first-prize envelope . three dollars in the second and two dollars in the third . " The last three people would win , " he said . " because by the end of the show they were the only ones anybody remembered . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and won nothing . but the next joint put me on third from the end and won third prize . Then they moved me to next to last and I won second . I worked about seven places in Brooklyn and Queens . but I never won because all these places were owned by Italians . and they always saved for last an Italian guy , who wore a tux from his wedding jobs and sang Sorrento . " Then there were the two summers as a social director in the Catskills at the white-clapboarded hotels with 100 guests or less , and that first summer he worked three of them and still did n't last through August . In one of them the owner had two sons , about eight and nine years old . who used to walk around tossing lighted matches and chanting . " Our father owns the hotel . Our father oats the hotel . " " Until one day , " he said . " they burned up Mean I grabbed one of the kids and I said . ' I ni gon na break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . ' So he ran down to where his mother was working on the books in the kitchen . and the next morning she gave me my two weeith , not ice . " Then there was the place ! , l hey gave ! dm. for sleeping gnat-leis. the 111 ; 1 .. ? , ? ti ull ? 1 , .. stage in the barn they called the Were paying him a week , which I v cut I ? ? $15 , and after breakfast he 'd conduct calisthenics and then start the games . In the afternoons he 'd give swimming lessons and ilwn mambo lessons . " You never had ? I name . Everybody called you ' M.C. ' You I.:11 , ' 11ey , M.C. , where 's the croquet set ? ' , ? ' 11 1 . C .. what do we do now ? ' " Then at tu , , h I there were always the shows . They had three high-school kids with complexion problems in the band , and he 'd line up contestants for What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conduct You Bet ' our Life . " At one place . " he said , " they told me they 'd see how I did the first night , so I did Johnny Ray singing Cry , and when I did the line : ' So Lear your clothes off and go on and cry , ' 1 tore off my shirt . Everybody was impressed that I ripped up a good shirt . but this was an act I could do only once . " But you learn , " he said . " in this business you learn that the little agents knock you to the big agents because they want to keep you small so they can hang on to you . You learn to live with some of those owners too . Four or five years ago I played a place down near here in New Jersey . It was like a bowling alley with plastic palms , and the first night there were about eight people there . It was n't even an audience . and when I came off , the owner called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was some owner . " When he could n't get me canceled. he decided to give me some advice . He said , ' If you want to be successful you got to have a routine that 's your own original . ' Then he named a comic who had been a big hit there . and he said . ' This guy does a bit about an Italian immigrant in a phone booth . ' I said , ' But that 's Danny Thomas 's . ' He named another guy . and he said , ' He 's got a bit about moving to the suburbs . ' I said , ' But that 's Alan King 's . ' He had a third guy , and I forget what the routine was , but it was Joey Bishop 's . " Some guys , " he said , " can actually do material that was stolen from a comedian sitting right in the room . When you work Boston , the local comedians sit there with paper and pencil and take your stuff down . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Latin Casino in Cherry Hill is what they call a theater restaurant , with its big stage and tables , on levels rising toward the back , set up to seat 2.200 . It was 3:30 when he got there , and he could hear Peggy Lee rehearsing . He had worked the Copacabana with her five months before , so , when she finished her number , he walked out onstage and they shook hands , and then he said hello to Lou Levy , her pianist and conductor , and met Joe Frasetto , the house band leader , and Jack Curtis , the M.C. When Peggy Eee was through , he gave his own music to Joe Frasetto. and then they went over it together with the band . After that he checked into a motel-hotel , showered and shaved and got into his tux . " I think a tux hangs you up , " he said . " Too formal . In a place like this , though , on opening night , and with Peggy Lee , you wear a tux . It goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always that nervousness . The room is strange  --  the lights and the acoustics and the size and setup of it  --  and you never know who might be there . One night , while he was working at Bon Soir , down in Greenwich Village . one of Jack Paar 's writers caught him , and that 's how he got on TV with Jack Paar . Then , on opening night , you 're worried because the newspaper critics are going to be there . You want to do your best stuff for them , but at the same time you have to hit with the audience so the owners will like you . " And besides all that , " he was saying now , oi wonder if your material will go over in this I You km/W what t ! Icy say in this business . It ICI matter what you 've done before ; you 're only as gcniiI as your last , show . " Just before he was to go on , Jack Curtis , the M.C. , came down and knocked : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Thanks . ' ' In front of the mirror he checked his tie and his hair , and lie walked out . He followed Jack Curtis around behind the curtain . Onstage Joe Frasetto was briefing the band , and then Jack Curtis was at the offstage mike , and then the band was in a piece from Fiddler on the Roof . " This is a tough spot , " he was saying . " You 're going on cold , because they 're sitting and watching the band play listening music . " . and now , " Jack Curtis was saying , " how ' about a nice greeting for a great young comic and a great guy ... Jeremy Vernon ! " " Thank you ! Thank you ! " lie said , and , looking out with the spot on him , he could see that the whole front of the house was filled , so there must have been at least 500 of them there . " I want to say that I 'm very glad to be here in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your life in your hands to get here . I 'm sure you 've driven over that George Washington Bridge . There 's a sign there . . . " He gave them the rest of the road-signs routine , started to bring them around with a bit he does about TV commercials , and then went into the airlines routine with the German pilot . " Achtung ! Achtung ! Aehtung ! ? he was saying . " Attention all prisoners ! . . Ach , excuse me , I mean passengers . . . . You will march to your seats , and you will be seated ! . . . We will show you a motion picture , and you will enjoy it ! The name from this picture is The Longest Day . with a surprise ending . We are showing the film backwards , and the Allies , they are retreating into the ocean .... " " This is your pilot speaking , " he was saying , doing the Israeli , " and did I ever lie to you ? Welcome aboard Flight 498. marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be coming down the aisle with a nice bowl hot chicken soup , a glass seltzer and some costume jewelry ... . " " That 's good ! " a blonde at one of the front tables was calling up to him now . " Very good ! " " This is your pilot , " he was saying with the Russian accent . " My name I am not allowed to disclose . Welcome aboard Defection Flight 402 ... Our destination -- I am not able to disclose that either . When lie closed , reciting the passenger list of the 51.1 Russian composers , the applause was good . As he walked off , Jack Curtis , coming on , gave him the smile and the nod , and he went back for a bow , coming off again into the darkness of the wings with Peggy Lee 's musicians moving on and Peggy Lee waiting there with her wardrobe mistress and her hairdresser . " I do n't know , " he said . " Maybe seventyfive-eighty . You see , a lot of them were still eating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they would all be complimentary , except one . There is almost always that one critic who , maybe because he 's afraid he ca n't keep the franchise unless he puts in the rap , finds some one thing he does n't like , but the musicians and the help would know the truth . The musicians and the maitre d ' and the waitresses would really know the audiences , and when , after a couple of days , they would nod and smile and even stop to talk , he would know he was all right . Then , at the end of the first week , one of the owners would come back to the dressing room to pay him and tell him that everybody liked him , but after the second week he 'd be gone again . " It 's a good living , " he said once . " The hours are good , and the pay is good , but 1 see myself moving toward my forties , and I do n't know . I have no home life . Every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away for a month and when I come back she 's engaged . I 'd like to get married , and I like children , but the life 's not ideal for that . " A comic is a strange guy , " he said . " He believes in his own greatness . so he 's vain , but at the same time he 's also insecure . There are people in this industry who tell me I 'm star material , so I believe them . If it 's true , I 'd like to be a comedy actor , like Danny Kaye or Berle or Skelton . Maybe tomorrow ' , maybe the next day , I do n't know . " 1:1
