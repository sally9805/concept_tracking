In practice , the world 's finest golfer looked unbeatable . Tanned and trim , Arnold Palmer ( TIME Cover , May 2 ) , spent hours perfecting his power off the tee , sent shots that seemed to soar forever in the rarefied , mile-high air of the Cherry Hills Country Club outside of Denver . On the greens , the 30-year-old Palmer had the same gentle touch that had brought him from behind in April to win the prestigious Masters , give him a big lead as the year 's top money winner . Ready to turn Cherry Hills into a pitch-and-putt course , Palmer was a confident 4-1 favorite when the field of 150 amateurs and pros teed off last week in the 60th U.S. Open , the biggest tournament in golf . <P> On the very first hole , Arnold Palmer splashed into the water , and the 1960 Open was suddenly turned from a one-man romp into the most dramatic in history . With his pre-tournament perfection gone , Palmer labored like a Sunday duffer . His drives wandered about the fairways , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talents for " scrambling " kept him in the tournament at all . After the first 36 ( of 72 ) holes , Palmer 's one-over-par 143 tied him for a sorry 15th behind the surprise leader , Mike Souchak . <P> Birdie-Birdie . A burly muscle-boy , Souchak not only was driving the ball out of sight , as expected , but his erratic putter was so steady that his two-round total of 135 was the lowest in Open history . Full of his customary good cheer , Souchak seemed about to disprove the old golfing axiom that relaxed guys finish last . But in the third round , Souchak began to suffer . Startled by the sudden sound of a spectator 's camera , he drove out-of-bounds on the 18th , and smiled no more . Still , going into the final round , he had what seemed a safe , two-stroke lead on the field . Taut with frustration , Arnold Palmer was still floundering back in 15th place , a full seven strokes behind Souchak . <P> Then Palmer began one of golf 's great rounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the green 346 yds. away . He putted for a birdie . On the second , he pulled off another astonishing shot : a 30-ft. chip into the cup for a birdie . " I really felt then I was on my way . " he said later . On the third , his second shot stopped a yard from the pin to set up another birdie . On the fourth , he canned a twisting 20-ft. putt-for his fourth straight birdie . He parred the fifth , then sank a 25-ft. putt on the sixth and a 6-footer on the seventh for birdies , finished the first nine in five under par . Around the course the word passed with electric swiftness : " Palmer made the turn in 30 . " <P> The next nine holes were decisive . Hitting with full power , Palmer reached the green on the 563-yd. eleventh hole in two shots , holed out in two putts for another birdie to go four under par for the tournament . With Souchak fading fast , the Open turned into a frantic , four-way fight between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jack Nicklaus. 20 , the husky U.S. Amateur champion , and a fagged-out Ben Hogan , 47 , gallantly trying for his fifth victory in the event .
