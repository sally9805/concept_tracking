<P> Like the events it describes in minute detail , William Manchester 's The Death of a President has become a source of endless contention . Phase one of the controversy , the author 's public clash with the Kennedy family , has given way to dispute over Manchester 's accuracy on several substantive points . Last week Manchester 's forthcoming $10 , 710-page work came under serious challenge from a $1 , 128-page paperback titled The Truth about the Assassination . <P> Truth was written by Charles Roberts , an able newsman who has been Newsweek 's White House correspondent since 1954 . Roberts was in Dallas the day of the murder and became one of the two newsmen ( the other : U.P.I. 's Merriman Smith ) to fly back to Washington on the plane carrying the dead President and his successor . And , unlike Manchester , who was originally commissioned by the Kennedy family , Roberts has written his account " without authorization from anyone , not as a Kennedy man or as a Johnson man , but as a reporter who covered both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roberts and Manchester chiefly differ in describing the interplay between Lyndon Johnson and Kennedy 's bereaved intimates during the hours immediately after the murder . The overwhelming impression created by Death 's prepublication publicity is that Manchester condemns Johnson for needless cruelty . In the Look serialization , Manchester writes that " aspects of Johnson 's behavior in a very understandable state of shock may have proven exacerbating . " To this , Roberts replies that Johnson 's assumption of power was " careful , correct , considerate and compassionate . " <P> A major point of friction was the logistical and procedural snarl of returning to Washington . Manchester implies that it would have been much easier on Mrs. Kennedy if Johnson had left the presidential plane to her and the coffin and used the similar vice-presidential jet himself . Says Manchester of the two Boeing 707s : " Each carried the same equipment , both were guarded . " On the contrary , says Roberts , U.S.A.F. 26000 , the presidential craft , " then contained far more and better communications equipment-transmitting , receiving , coding and decoding-than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then there was the question of when to depart . Johnson wanted to be sworn in officially before takeoff . Kennedy aides wanted to leave Love Field as soon as the coffin and Mrs. Kennedy arrived . Manchester , relying on interviews conducted later , reports a tense scene between Johnson and Kenneth O'Donnell , J.F.K. 's appointments secretary , in which O'Donnell " over and over " insisted : " We 've got to go , we 've got to get out of here , we ca n't wait . " But Roberts says he could detect no " atmosphere of crackling tension . " Further , he quotes O'Donnell as saying later : " I realized it was an inevitable delay . So I do n't believe I commented on it . I just listened to him . "
