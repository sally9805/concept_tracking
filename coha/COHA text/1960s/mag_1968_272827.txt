Like many another radio-station operator , John M. Norris , of Red Lion , Pa. , stopped by the Federal Communications Commission headquarters when he was in Washington recently . What made his visit notable was that Norris , who also happens to be a Bible Presbyte rian minister , brought along six asso ciates . All seven of them planted themselves outside the door of FCC Chairman Rosel Hyde , bowed their heads and began a pray-in , asking the Great Commissioner up yonder to force a decision on a TV franchise application that the FCC has been sitting on . <P> The Rev. Mr. Norris has been waiting for action on his TV application because the FCC is trying to deal with charges that a Norris-owned radio station violated the so-called " fairness doctrine . " Norris ' complaint is that his case has been pending since 1965-though that is not very long in terms of the FCC 's decision-making process . After all , the agency has yet to settle a dispute over a certain frequency allotment claimed by Manhattan radio station WABC and Albuquerque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And when the House Commerce Committee recently requested a one-year moratorium on any FCC rules on pay TV , the commission did not mind very much-since the FCC had already managed to avoid settling the issue for 13 years . <P> Thus it is unsurprising that the poky ways of the FCC tend to bring out not only the prayers but the Don Rickles in most people . Michigan 's Democratic Congressman John Dingell said last week that the FCC people " are in such a horrible quagmire of past failures that they ca n't face any of the problems before them . " Newton Minow , the FCC 's critical and scholarly ex-chairman , recalls that it was all " a quixotic world of undefined terms , private pressures and tools unsuited to the work . " Some of the incumbent commissioners throw up their hands . The youngest of them , Nicholas Johnson , 33 , says : " We have n't the slightest idea of what 's going out over the air waves . " <P> Equal Time . The latest hassle concerns the commission 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station that puts one political candidate on the air ( except in a news show ) must give comparable exposure to his opponents . In the most publicized of what will undoubtedly be many legal tests during the current campaign , Senator Eugene McCarthy claimed equal time after Lyndon Johnson 's December " Conversation with the President , " which ran on all three networks . The FCC denied the request , declaring that the President was not an avowed candidate at the time . McCarthy then took his case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and lost . <P> Another provision of the fairness rule - obligating stations to offer reply time to victims of " personal attack " - is now also being challenged in the courts by the networks on the ground that the procedure inhibits free speech . Last week , in a typical retreat , the FCC asked that the decision be held off while it considered modification of the rule . Just as typically , the House Investigations Subcommittee plans to move in with two days of hearings on the whole subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
