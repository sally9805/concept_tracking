In Capitol Hill action last week : <P> &gt;The House , by a lopsided vote of 319 to 79 , passed and sent to the Senate an education bill to provide $1.5 billion in aid to colleges over the next five years . The money ( $900 million in grants , $600 million in loans ) would be used for construction of classroom buildings , libraries , laboratories , etc . President Kennedy had wanted much more . Though he had all but given up on his request for $2.3 billion for secondary school construction and teachers ' salaries , after last year 's battle over whether parochial schools could be included , he vainly hoped for $750 million to raise teaching standards , $600 million for medical education , $50 million for a campaign to educate illiterates . One other Kennedy proposal still has a slight chance : the Senate version of the bill includes $892 million for 212,500 college scholarships . If the provision survives Senate vote , it will have to face House resistance again in a Senate-House conference committee . <P> &gt;The Senate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as director of the Central Intelligence Agency . McCone , a wealthy Californian with oil and shipping interests , was Under Secretary of the Air Force in the Truman Administration , chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission under President Eisenhower . Though he won unanimous confirmation for those earlier posts , he ran into opposition this time on varied grounds . Maine 's Republican Senator Margaret Chase Smith argued that McCone has never done intelligence work . South Dakota 's Republican Senator Francis Case worried about McCone 's business interests : " Will his instincts be free from his background ? " Pennsylvania 's Democratic Senator Joseph Clark and Minnesota 's Democratic Senator Eugene McCarthy insisted that McCone was temperamentally unsuited for the job . Ruffled senatorial sensibility accounted for still another " no ' ' vote : Arkansas ' Democratic Senator J. William Fulbright said that no one had consulted his Foreign Relations Committee about the appointment . <P> &gt;Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield 's bill to make a sixth-grade education the only required proof of a voter 's literacy , now backed by Minority Leader Everett Dirksen as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bill hoped to avoid sending their measure to the Judiciary Committee , which , under Mississippi 's Senator James Eastland , has been a graveyard for civil rights legislation . They hoped instead to have it referred to Mansfield 's Senate Rules Committee . But Vice President Lyndon Johnson , advised by the Senate parliamentarian , ruled that it had to go to Judiciary . The setback will be only temporary , Mansfield promised . If the Judiciary Committee does not act within 90 days , he will attach his proposal as an amendment to unrelated legislation .
