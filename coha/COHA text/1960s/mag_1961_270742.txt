The best college football player in the U.S. this season is a gangling , astigmatic , pigeon-toed son of a shoemaker who sleeps on the floor , runs in the street , dances The Twist , and quotes Sociologist David Riesman . On or off the field , Michigan State Junior George Saimes is something of an iconoclast : a B-plus student who shuns " snap " courses , scoffs at fraternities ( " They only do what society tells them to " ) , and rouses himself to fever pitch with a kind of self-hypnosis . " Every time they send me in , " says Fullback Saimes , 20 , " I tell myself that the next play is going to be the last of my career , and I ought to do the very best I can . " <P> Largely because log-legged George Saimes has been doing his very best all season long , unbeaten Michigan State is the nation 's top-ranked team . Against powerful Michigan , Saimes played on both defense and offense , spent more time on the field than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brilliant , 17-yd. run . In the locker room just before the Notre Dame game , Saimes lost his contact lenses . But his sight was keen enough to throw six key blocks in the last half and to find holes so effectively that he scored two touchdowns in a frenzied third quarter that buried Irish hopes ( 17-7 ) . Last week against Indiana , Saimes , though nursing a painfully bruised right leg , bulled his way for one touchdown , intercepted a pass , and stormed up from the secondary to slam down Hoosier ball carriers as the Spartans won easily 35-0 . <P> Underfed Boy . At a rock-hard 187 Ibs. , Saimes looks like an underfed boy alongside such hulking Big Ten fullbacks as his own Spartan rival , Ron Hatcher ( 220 Ibs. ) , and Ohio State 's Bob Ferguson ( 225 lbs . ) . Coach Duffy Daugherty insists that Saimes is the finest fullback he has ever coached at Michigan State . " I 've said it before , and I 'll say it again , " says Daugherty . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tackle-and I know he would if I asked him to . " <P> On offense , Fullback Saimes is a scuttling , crablike runner , deceptively fast and agile . " He runs like Groucho Marx walks . " says Michigan Line Coach Bob Hollaway . " Thump , thump , thump . " Says <P> Daugherty : " George runs with his legs wide apart , almost at a gallop . That 's what makes him so hard to bring down . If you get only one leg and the other 's still moving , he jerks it away and he 's gone . " A bone-rattling blocker , Saimes enjoys banging shoulder pads with defensive ends who outweigh him by 25 lbs . or more . " I like to go at an end straight up , " he says , " as though I were carrying the ball . When I hit him , I try to play my helmet right under his chin as hard as I can . That shocks him .
