Franklin , or Teddy ? <P> Sir : TIME 'S coverage of the Dominican situation May 7 was most illuminating , especially the special section on the long history of fear and hate on the entire island of Hispaniola . It is common knowledge that a Dominican rebellion was bound to come . In fact , most political scientists predicted this long before the assassination of Trujillo . Therefore , the necessity for immediate troop movements by President Johnson did not come as a great surprise to Latin diplomats . The protection of our nationals and the prevention of a Communist take-over surely provided enough justification . <P> CHARLES FREEMAN New York City <P> Sir : General Wessin y Wessin is not preventing another Cuba . He is creating the conditions for it by preventing the return of the democratically elected President , whom he illegally deposed , and the re-establishment of the constitution , which he abolished . And we are helping him with it ! First by recognizing the illegal junta of D. R. Cabral ( which , incidentally , President Kennedy refused to do ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be " impartial " but are in practice helping to prevent the return of Juan Bosch . <P> ANDREW DIENES Pasadena , Calif . <P> <P> Sir : Sending U.S. Marines to the Dominican Republic is about as tactful as sending the Selma police force to handle a disturbance in Harlem . <P> MARVIN ROSEN New York City <P> Sir : Bully for Lyndon ! He 's growing more like Teddy and less like Franklin every day . Y'all charge now . . . Medford , Mass . <P> WILLIAM PURVES Tufts University <P> Sir : Believing that TIME shows as much courage and foresight in being consistently anti-Communist as in being consistently pro-integration , I applaud much of your realism in the Wessin y Wessin cover story . But I do feel that the inconsistencies in our foreign policy , which did so much to force us into the necessary but tragic intervention , are an essential part of the story . Bosch 's downfall certainly stemmed from his incompetence , his failure to fulfill campaign promises , and his softness toward Communists ; yet had we intervened then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , no one could accuse us of intervening on the side of a military clique without popular support . If last week 's revolt began , as the President says , as " an action dedicated to social justice , " why did no word of encouragement come from Washington in the period before the Communists began to infiltrate the rebel ranks ? If our foreign policy continues to be mainly " anti " in underdeveloped countries that require drastic social and land reforms , the Communists will always side with the " pros " and , in the end , leave us with no ally but naked force . <P> SELDEN RODMAN-Oakland , N.J. <P> <P> Sir : As an ex-Peace Corps volunteer in the Dominican Republic , I took rather perverse satisfaction in discovering that even TIME ( which was , and is , my symbol of accuracy ) occasionally blunders . If that 's not former Dictator Trujillo in your *picture captioned " Bosch in Puerto Rico , " I 'll gladly pay double for next week 's edition . <P> <P> DWIGHT TUINSTRA <P> St. Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
