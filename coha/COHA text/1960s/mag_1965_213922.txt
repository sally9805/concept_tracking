WESTERN EUROPE <P> The price of prosperity has come high in Europe , where wages and prices have vied in outracing each other . Unlike the U.S. , which is worried about how to keep its economy advancing , Europe has had to worry about how to stop its boom from moving too fast . The Continent was actually relieved by predictions that most economies will slow down in 1965 , but it has not relaxed its vigilance against inflation . To prevent further rises in wages and prices , West Germany 's Bundesbank last week raised its discount rate from 3% to 3% , serving notice that prospering West Germany feels that it is time for some restraint . <P> Porridge to Pickles . Since such an increase normally attracts foreign speculators , the West German Parliament is expected to pass a 25% capital-gains tax to discourage all non-German bondholders . The reason , says Bundesbank President Karl Blessing , is that the rate rise is meant solely as a warning to West German industry . The nation 's most distinguished economists warned this month that price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise about 10% every year . Overall prices jumped 2.9% in a year , but the average concealed some rough rises : a 6.7% hike in rents , an increase in the price of butter from 90 to $1 per lb. , in pork from 95 to $1.20 per lb . <P> All of Western Europe seems to share the problem . French labor and business are chafing under a strict economic-stabilization program designed to lower the growth rate from 7.5% to 4.5%-and prices and wages with it . By imposing a merciless credit hold-down , Italy braked industrial growth from 5% to 1.5% last year . Along with the other problems of its economy . Britain is alarmed by its quickened wage-price spiral . The cost of living has jumped 4.6% in the sharpest twelvemonth rise in a decade , and British housewives this month found that prices had risen for some 3,200 different grocery items , from porridge to pickles . <P> Communist &; Catholic . Wages in Europe are outpacing both productivity and living costs . Since 1958 , they have risen 67% in Germany , 56% in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Despite this , labor leaders use constantly increasing prices to demand even higher wages . In Italy , 7,000,000 workers will be looking for more in contract negotiations this year , and Communist Labor Leader Agostino Novella last week refused government pleas for a wage truce . In France , Communist and Catholic workers alike are scheduled to strike this week . <P> Even royalty has been affected by the wage-price spiral . Though Belgium 's King Baudouin and Queen Fabiola cut back their palace staff from 302 to 188 , wages have risen so much that the King has been spending almost all his income on upkeep . At his request . Parliament last week voted him a $160,000 raise in salary to $1,000,000 a year . To make sure that he will not be caught in such straits again , Parliament also decreed that Baudouin 's wages , like those of every Belgian union man , will henceforth include an automatic cost-of-living increase .
