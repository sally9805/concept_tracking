He Was a Man of Principle by Impertinax Headline , New York Times , September 10 , 1962 : GENERAL WALKER SEIZES CAPITAL ; TANKS CIRCLE THE WHITE . HOUSE ; NEW JUNTA PROMISES ELECTIONS From a " Letter from Washington , " The New Yorker , September 22 , 1962 . Even in this blase capital , there were some eyebrows raised by the whirligig of events that have made Major General Edwin A. Walker the provisional President of the United States until ? or so his aides inform us ? new elections are held in 18 months . That the army had become increasingly involved in the perturbations of politics had been known . Still , the ease with which General Walker seized the livers of state was entirely unexpected . Congress had adjourned only several days earlier . Few of the legislators were around town on the otherwise calm Sunday when a fleet of Sherman tanks surrounded the White House , while other military units took over the city 's television and radio stations . The President was at church ( some of the General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and by the time he had left his pew this crisp , if woodenly-phrased , announcement could be heard on the air : " Attention ! Citizens of the United States ! In order to restore- republican government to our beloved country , a group of patriotic soldiers has assumed the grave burdens of state . We appeal for calm . We pledge to reassert the noble principles enshrined in our Constitution , with justice under God . The hour of liberty has struck ! " In the ensuing confusion , the President and his family drove to the White House but were barred from entering the grounds by troops with fixed bayonets . He , his wife and children sought asylum in the Mexican Embassy . Members of his cabinet took flight , many heading for the Dominican Republic , where the newly-elected government said it would welcome democratic exiles . There was remarkably little bloodshed . Now attention centers on General Walker 's skill as IMPERTINAX is the pseudonym of two Washington newspapermen who found the following sheaf of clippings in the foyer of a Latin American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cabinet carpenter . But despite a buzz of rumors around the General 's temporary headquarters in a chic row house in Georgetown , as of this writing no hard news has emerged . From the Washington Daily News , Sept. 24 , 1962 : JUNTA NAMES CABINET J. EDGAR TO STAY ON Washington , UPI ? Provisional President Walker told his news conference today that his new regime would be both bipartisan and moderate while taking " the red out of the red , white and blue . " The General , wearing civilian clothes , lashed out at his foes , served stern warning that the " age of sloth and socialism is over . " He opened his press conference with this announcement : " I am happy to report , ladies and gentlemen , that Mr. J. Edgar Hoover has agreed to stay on in his post as Director of the FBI . " Other appointments announced were : Secretary of State : General Douglas MacArthur ; Secretary of Treasury : Senator Harry F. Byrd ( D , Va . ) ; Secretary of Defense : Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas oilman H. L. Hunt ; Attorney General : Investigator Roy M. Cohn ; Labor : Ex-Teamster chief David Beck ; Health , Education and Welfare : Senator Barry M. Goldwater ( R , Ariz . ) ; Commerce : Industrialist Sewell Avery . BULLETIN White House Press Secretary Ralph de Toledano announced that General Robert Wood will replace the late Sewell Avery as Secretary of Commerce . He also listed these new members of the Old Frontier team : Robert Welch , head of the John Birch Society , will become chairman of SACB ( Subversive Activities Control Board ) , while T. Coleman Andrews has agreed to return to his former post of Commissioner of Internal Revenue . De Toledano said that PFC G. David Schine ( USA-ret. ) has assumed duties as Secretary of the Army . Capt . Eddie Rickenbacker will serve as Air Secretary . James 0 . Eastland has resigned from the Senate to head up the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department . Former Gov . J. Bracken Lee of Utah will be Ambassador to the United Nations . Appearing with de Toledano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duties once held by Harvard Historian Arthur M. Schlesinger , Jr . Buckley said no final decision has been made on appointing Commentator Fulton Lewis , Jr . as director of the United States Information Service . Column by Walter Lippmann , in the Washington Post , September 30 , 1962 : There will be grave misgivings about the first moves the provisional : , government has taken in foreign afaf fairs . I venture to say that General Walker has acted rashly in violating one of the cardinal rules of diplomacy . This is that a great power must act like a great power . It must face reality . In withdrawing diplomatic recognition from all but six countries ( Spain , Portugal , South Africa , Formosa , Nicaragua and Paraguay ) , the new government has allowed its emotions to master its common sense . It is also disquieting that General Walker has allowed the Daughters of the American Revolution to take possession of the United Nations building in New York as a new headquarters . For while it is of course true that the DAR 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a diminished UN of seven nations , it would not be right to think that the DAR can meet happily in their new surroundings . Additionally , in yielding to the demand that each of the 5o states in this country be allowed to handle its own foreign affairs , the General has been stampeded into an imprudent decision . A period of confusion is bound to follow . Column by David Lawrence , in the Washington Star , October / , 1962 : The extremists of the ultra-Liberal camp can be counted on to make their usual shrill protests about the impressive monetary reform launched by General Walker . Fortunately for the republic they no longer enjoy the commanding position they once had in our press and universities . It is refreshing to see the motto of fiscal responsibility posted on the banners of state . We are now back on the gold standard , and President Walker has shown himself an adroit politician by coupling this basic reform with two symbolic gestures . All Franklin Roosevelt dimes are to be recalled , thus at last eliminating the indignity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the general downgrading of Thomas Jefferson , the President is said to be considering the same remedy for nickels . In my opinion , this is necessary . Now the country can look forward to the new gold-backed dollars which Mr. Harold Gray is designing . Surely Mr. Gray will blend the soundness of his style with the soundness of the currency and produce a de-sign of which Daddy Warbucks and the rest of us will approve . Column by Drew Pearson in the Washington Post , October 6 , 1962 : It may be denied but General Walker is having trouble with his own anti-party group on the hard , hard , hard , hard Right . They are bluntly critical of his decision to pack the Supreme Court and say the High Bench should be liquidated completely . Behind closed doors at the White House , this angry discussion took place between Walker , SACB Czar Robert Welch , USIA Boss Fulton Lewis , Jr. , and HEW Secretary Goldwater . Walker : Bob , we 've gone far enough . Orval Faubus will do a great job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chief Justice . Welch : Let 's not be sentimental . Ed , you know damn well what happens . Those fellows take the oath and then try to please that law school crowd . Lewis : Junk it altogether , Ed . We 've got state courts to do the job . Goldwater : Fulton , let 's be realistic on this one . Do we want to look like extremists ? Remember , in 1892 , the Court threw out the Federal Income Tax . I say let 's build on the past and not destroy it . NOTE : The key man in the court move is George Sokolsky , the columnist , who is trying to win agreement backstage on a reformed court in which all opinions would have to be approved by three-fourths of the state legislatures . From Time , November 1 , 1962 : USA , Inc . In Washington , they already call it The Day of Decrees . It began at 2:05 p.m. on a sun-spangled patch of White House lawn . Suddenly , a plume of clouds towered up into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forming a familiar symbol . Gasped one TV newsman , as cameras dollied into position , " God , look at it ! It 's a dollar sign ! " Brisk , blunt Maj. Gen. Edwin A. ( for Americanism ) Walker strode to the makeshift podium , arm-in-arm with Old Friend and SACB head Robert Welch . As Walker , 52 , intoned the Pledge of Allegiance , keenearred onlookers caught a hint of what was to come : .. one nation , incorporated , under God , with liberty and justice for all . " With military punctillio , Walker droned through the sheaf of decrees , smiling only once as Social Security Director Vivien Kellems lost control of an outsize , feather-garnished hat . When observers totted up the decrees , their final balance was this : ? The US is henceforth a limited stock corporation in which voting rights will be weighted by ownership . ? Government assets ( post office , parks , CIA , etc. ) are to be auctioned off under direction of a capital issues committee . ? Voting stock will be restricted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the PreS'ident will be named by a national Board of Directors of USA , Inc . As Walker finished , the clouds scudded away and the sun gleamed through . Was this a portent ? Washington was not : A picnic followed on the lawn ( menu : baked clams , corn , American cheese and root beer ) , with Walker sharing the head table with novelist Ayn Rand ( Fountainhead , Atlas Shrugged ) . So ended the Day of Decrees . From the Wall Street Journal , November 17 , 1962 : REDS ARE REPORTED BUYING US STOCK Moscow ? Sources close to the Kremlin indicated today that Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev is studying a plan whereby the Russian state could acquire shares in USA , Inc . It would take an estimated $314 billion to win majority control . Under the incorporation laws decreed by President Walker it would be legal for purchases to be made through a United States citizen eligible to vote . Moscow is swarming with speculators anxious to bring the bear into the bull market . Informants say Khrushchev is especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Inc. ( formerly the Defense Department ) and Intelligence , Ltd. ( formerly the CIA ) . Rumors buoyed up prices in both companies . From the New Yorlc Daily News , December 24 , 1962 : KAYO BY MR . K ! KHRUSH MAKES IT , DUE HERE MONDAY Washington , Dec. z4 ? At 4:16 a.m. this morning , Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev achieved the needed margin to give him majority control of USA , Inc . President Walker urged the country to be calm , adding : " I know I will be under tremendous pressure from the radicals to intervene ? the same crowd that always tries to get us in the Red . But I do not intend to dishonor the principles of private property and republican government . " Chairman of the Board Khrushchev has assured me that he will also respect the rights of property that he has legally acquired . I am sure he will do that . " Whatever happens , we can derive comfort from the fact that America was not destroyed by the enemies within .
