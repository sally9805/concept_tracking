The bacteria known as Staphyiococcus aureus are dreaded by doctors as a cause of dangerous and persistent infections in many parts of the body . Ironically , the kinds of " staph " commonly found in hospitals are the worst of all , because they have developed resistance to most of the antibiotics around them . They are spread , usually from wounds or boils , not only on patients ' linen , but also on nurses ' hands and surgeons ' breath , and even through air ducts . Newborn babies , with practically no resistance , are especially susceptible . Some hospital nurseries have been decimated by staph epidemics . <P> Doctors have tried everything they could think of to check staph , and now it appears that a good way to do it is to fight staph with staph . There are as many varieties of staph as there are breeds of dogs , and some are harmless while others are vicious . Researchers in Manhattan and Cincinnati got the idea that if they could " infect " newborn babies with a harmless strain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> In last week 's A.M.A. Journal , Pediatricians Irwin J. Light and James M. Sutherland reported how well the technique worked . They grew a gentle strain of staph , dubbed 502A , in soy broth , and swabbed a minute amount of the germ-laden fluid into the nostrils and on the unhealed navels of one-hour-old babies in Cincinnati General Hospital . The 502A " took " ; air sampling and other tests showed that dangerous strains of staph soon disappeared from the nurseries . But the harmful strains reappeared after swabbing was stopped . Medical men call the staph v. staph process " bacterial interference , " and are not quite sure how it happens . Some suspect that interference may occur be cause one strain of staph utilizes some substance that the other strain needs in order to live , or that one strain produces something that kills the other . <P> The method is not recommended for routine , continuous use because some babies develop a rash from 502A . But it can be instituted whenever a virulent strain of " hospital staph " is detected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has halted such invasions .
