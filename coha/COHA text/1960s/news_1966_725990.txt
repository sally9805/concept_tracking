txt The Johnson Administration is considering asking Congress next year for an increase in mail rates . In an interview today , Postmaster General Lawrence F. O'Brien said a I decision had not yet been reached on whether to reel ommend an increase . However , many officials believe that the urgency of the problems faced by the postal service will overcome the natural political reluctance of the Administration to propose a rise in mail rates . A postal service that is burdened with old and inadequate facilities , a shortage of modern , mail-handling machinery , a change in transportation patterns and manpower problems is now confronted with an extraordinary increase in mail volume . This year that volume will reach an estimated total IV .80 billion pieces , an increase over last year of 6 per cent . ? Tie department 's budget was based on an expected increase of 3 per cent . While the rates remain unchanged , the increase in post office business will produce a corresponding increase in the deficit . This is inevitable because Congress has decreed that certain groups ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  shall enjoy preferential rates as a public service , and that second , third and fourth-class mail need not pay its way . The estimated deficit for the // fiscal year ending next June 30 is $1,208,000,000 . Of this , $614-million represents the loss on public service mail and other services such as special delivery and rural routes , and $594-million represents the losses on commercial second , third and fourth-class mail . Faded with a choice between increasing rates and underwriting mounting deficits through appropriations , Congress , many officiela believe , will acquiesce in a rate increase . Officials note that a one-cent increase in the first-class letter rate would bring in $500-million , and a modest rise in second , third and fourth-class rates would produce $150-mi1-lion more . Together they would eliminate the present deficit on commercial mail , which accounts for 80 to 85 per cent of total mail . Mr. O'Brien shied away today from any discussion of the sensitive question of rate increases . However , he referred to a speech he gave in Louisville on Sept 29 to the National Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the time must come when the scope and quality of service , and not extraneous factors , will ultimately determine our operating revenue . " Optimistic Mood Despite his manifold problems , the sandy-haired politician , who has served both President Kennedy and President Johnson as persuader extraordinary on Capitol Hill , was In an optimi.stio mood today . He had just received a progress report on the $100-million Mechanization program that he launched last January , soon after becoming Postmaster General . He hopes to have the program completely installed by November , 1968 . By far the biggest and most revolutionary item in this program will be a data processing system that will cost $33.5-million when completed . The system will have two centers ? at St. Louis and Paramus , N. J. ? that will link together the 75 largest post offices . Into those centers will go a constant flow of information relayed by regional offices from local postmasters on upcoming heavy mailing by commercial concerns . From the centers will go instructions on total volume expected , manpower needed , work schedules and routing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that yesterday the Paramus center got its last piece of equipment and would be operational the first of the new year . To begin with , the center will serve a complex embracing part of New England and upstate New York . Equipment is already installed and operational in Rochester , Syracuse , Albany and Springfield . In four more cities in the complex ? New Haven , Portland , Buffalo and the Bronx  --  work is 70 per cent completed . From his report , Mr. O'Brien also learned that deliveries would begin next June on 52 letter sorters for 30 cities and that installation would be cornpleted in June , 1968 . Between February and July next year . 80 facing and canceling machines will be delivered to 79 cities . On schedule also is the manufacture of 28 semi-automatic parcel sorting machines for nine large cities . Central to Mr. O'Brien 's confidence that the postal problem is surmountable is his abiding faith in the zip code when wedded to presorting by bulk mailers  --  a marriage that will take place by post office order on Jan. 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before delivery to the post office will be required of the second class and third class bulk mailers who supply 40 per cent of the mail and get a special bulk rate . The order is expected to affect 280,000 mailers . About 4,000 of these , mostly small firms , have asked for and been granted an extension of three to six months because of the expense involved in adding zip code numbers to address plates . When this mandatory zipcoding is in full effect , between 60 and 70 per cent of all mail will carry zip code numbers , as against about 53 per cent now . But Mr. O'Brien has probems that mechanization and zip coding can not solve . Sorting Centers Sought One of these is antiquated post offices in large cities . A prime example is the Chicago Post Office , which nearly broke down in late September and early October under an unexpected deluge of third class advertising mail . The nine-story building was erected more than 30 years ago . It was designed for a postal system based on the railroad &; It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail was to be taken to the top of the building and progressively sorted on the way down to the waiting railway cars . Today , the building is more bottleneck than funnel because of traffic conditions and lack of platform space for trucks . What the postal service believes it now needs to expedite mail is large sorting centers in the suburbs of principal cities . This takes money . Another problem arises from the cancellation of train service all over the country . There used to be 10,000 railway mail cars in which presorting of mail was done . Today , there are only 800 to 900 railway mail cars in service . Much of the sorting that used to be done in such cars must be done now at central distributing points that are already overburdened . Yet the law still gives preference to the railroads , which get 55 per cent of the $630-million spent for transportation . Furthermore , the post office of the department is for payroll . All , problemi of costs and service are exacerbated by the peculiar status of the post office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an industry . A few figures reveal how big the industry is . The department had 681,608 workers as of Nov. 18-476,886 regulars , 94,447 carrier substitutes and 110,275 temporary substitutes . The last two categories , for the most part , work part time pr only during heavy flows . On the basis of one employe for every 40 hours worked , there are 574,165 employes in the department . Only American Telephone and Telegraph Company and General Motors have more . In the current fiscal year , this industry will take in $5.018-billion in revenue and spend $6.249-billion . In income , it ranks ahead of United States Steel , Du Pont de Nemours &; Co. and International Business Machines . But these are the conditions wider which this industry op-erates : CIt can not control its sources of supply ; the mailing public does that . qIt has no control over its revenue . The revenue goes into the United States Treasury , and the post office must go to the Bureau of the Budget with its appropriation request , where it is generally cut , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Int can not control the prices lit charges for its service . They are set by Congress , elIt can not set its pay scales ; they , too , are set by Congress . ( In has only very limited control over 95 per cent of its costs because of laws passed by Congress . In his Louisville speech , Mr. O'Brien referred to the industry where there is " a complete separation between income gained from our activities and the funds we use to pay for our costs . " A ' Long Look ' Proposed ? The time has come , he said , to " accord our funding process a long and intensive look " - and decide whether this is " the best way to run a postal industry . " A quick look at the composition of the deficit for this fiscal year discloses why the post office does not , and can not , operate on its income and why some officials believe it should have at least some of the autonomy needed to operate on a business basis and improve its service . Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show a loss of $400-million . Of this , nearly half is public . service costs , stemming from reduced rates for such publications as the National Geographic ( counted as an educational magazine ) , the American Legion Magazine , fraternal magazines and the like . About $226-million represents the loss on regular newspapers and magazines , which pay about 30 per cent of the cost of , handling . Particularly costly to the department is the carrying of county newspapers . For transportation within a county , the minimum charze is of a cent a paper of 1% cents a pound . With employe costs at 7 cents a minute , the carrier would have to deliver a paper every second to recover costs . On third class mail ( mostly direct mail advertising ) the loss is expected to be $397-raillion , of which $95-million is attributable to public service and $302-million to strictly commercial mailing . On fourth class mail ( parcel post , books and records ) the total loss is expected to be $175-million , of which $68-mi1-lion is the result largely of preferential rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and record clubs . Among the " educational material " enjoying a fourth class rate of 10 cents a pound are records by the Beatles and copies of the book " Fanny Hill . " Only first class mail . ( personal and business ) is expected to show a profit  --  a modest $48-million . It must let contracts through competi , tive bidding , and many of the , contracts are won by small operators whose service is criticized as of low quality . Consequently , few established common carriers bid for such routes . The post ? office , in the opinion of many officials , should have authority to negotiate contracts with such carriers . This lack of flexibility in arranging transportation , they contend , impairs service . Then there is the problem of manpower , which mechanization can mitigate but not solve entirely . At the heart of this problem is the pay scale for clerks and letter carriers . After a 20 per cent increase lover the last four years , their beginning pay is now $5,331 , and their maximum after 21 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the service attractive in the rural areas and many small towns , it is not enough to attract young men and women in large cities , especially where there is a dwindling supply of unskilled labor . In the District of Columbia , for example , the transit company advertises for bus drivers at a starting salary of $6,600 . This problem may be alleviated by pay increases next year . The two principal postal unions  --  the clerks and letter carriers  --  want a straight raise and upgrading of positions that could mean a 15 to 20 per cent increase if Congress approves .
