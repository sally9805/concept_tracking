The Nutty Professor is half a funny movie . As long as Jerry Lewis is minding his myopic business as Professor Kelp , an earnest idiot of a chemistry teacher , the laughs bubble up like soda dumped into acid . But Lewis never knows when to stop fiddling with the formula , and suddenly the comedy blows up in his face . <P> Professor is a manic switcheroo on the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde theme . Kelp , with his chipmunk teeth , soup-bowl haircut , horn-rimmed half glasses and Neanderthal lope , is fed up with himself . One night in his laboratory he stirs up and quaffs a concoction that will make him strong , handsome and irresistible to women-for what woman could resist a sun-lamp tan , a Shinola coiffure , a high-roll shirt collar , and an electric blue suit with black lapels ? Thus decked out , God 's gift to coeds invades the Purple Pit ( a Paramount updating of the old campus hangout ) to dazzle the denizens . He bullies some fullbacks , sings some songs in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buddy Love . All this is too much for Student Stella Stevens , and off they go to a parking spot in Beverly Hills . But Lewis begins to feel the effects of his potion wearing off , and . . . <P> Lewis as Kelp is a nimble simpleton . In Professor 's nuttiest sight gag , somebody tosses him a pair of bar bells so ponderous that his arms get stretched to floor-length ; that night in bed , when his sock-clad feet poke out of the bottom of the covers , a pair of hands reaches out alongside to give them a sleepy scratch . But Lewis as the alter-ego maniac Buddy Love is a maudlin letdown . Starlet Stevens best sums up the trouble : " Just being one person is more than enough for any human being to handle .
