txt The Midwest farm country fanning out from this geographical center of the United States is fat . It is rich in crops . Farm prices and income have climbed as surpluses of wheat and feed grains disappear . 1 " We 've had the two best years since the 1940 's " is heard from Indiana to Colorado and from Kansas to the Dakotas . Yet there is a feeling that something is lacking , that all is not quite right in the world despite more money , more comforts on the farm and the prospect for at least another year of relative prosperity . Freshmen Battling Trend signs are scattered a full month before the Congressional elections , unlike 1964 , when President Johnson swept the Midwest . A few rural counties showed a distinct return to normal Republicanism . Freshman Democrats are still battling to repeat in marginal districts . It scares the Democrats andi heartens the Republicans as the political campaigns in the Mid-I west race toward the November ! elections and farmers prepare I for the fall corn harvest . State ' Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost some " from 1964 but they1 //  - -   - -  quickly add " he 's not running . " Nevertheless , party leaders have been crossing and recrossing the Midwest to woo the farm vote and save a dozen freshman House members whom Mr. Johnson wants returned to Washington . They also hope to pick up at least a Senate seat , Nebraska , and retain the party 's hold on statehouses in Iowa , Nebraska and Minnesota . Farmers look on themselves as having lost their political power . But with all the attenj tion they are getting this year , they believe they can swing som- ! of the close elections . 11711ation as a general term , mer .. ning the cost-price squeeze , has emerged as apparently uppermost in farmers ' minds , but the Vietnam conflict is not far behind and reveals a split farm personality . " We want to back our President , " Edward L. Narjes , 36-year-old wheat and cattle farmer of Cheyenne County , Neb. , said the other day . " But if you 're going to do a job , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that more " hawks " than " doves " are flying in the Midwest , a region with a tradition for militancy in the midst of conservatism . " I guess it is n't Johnson 's fault , " an Indiana corn-hog producer commented . " But by golly I ca n't figure out . how we got there Vietnam or how we car . ' get nut . But when we're. told ' we can get out by October , let 's make it this year ! " A country newspaper editor in Kansas ticked off the names of some farm boys who had been drafted . Their fathers are angry although the boys have not fussed too much . But those fathers are thinking how college students are deferred and askIng . " Are n't our boys being educated on the farm to be farmers ? " At Latimer , in the rich corn country of north central Iowa , 22-year-old Tom Johnson , who expects be called soon , said , " There's. very little sympathy around here for Vietnam " but as far as the draft was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do about it . " He helps his father , Bob , with a purebred Shorthorn cattle farm . Farm talk , however , seems to turn on prices and costs and interest rates and Government actions . The springtime furor in the farm belt when President Johnson and Secretary of Agriculture Orville L. Freeman appeared to blame climbing farm prices for inflation and the cost of food in the cities has stilled in the barnyards . But a Wisconsin county agent with 35 years ' experience among farmers commented : " Farmers will tell Orville he is a great Secretary of Agriculture but they have n't quite forgiven what he said . " Farm bankers reported " money always is available to good operators " but interest rates could move up . One county banker said " it 's 61/2 per cent straight " on real estate loans , used by farmers to enlarge farms , a continuing trend . The Administration 's increase in wheat acreage for the 1967 crop and the prospect of an increase in acreage later this year for corn and other feed grains and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his Nebraska neighbors expressed concern that perhaps the Administration 's intention was to put pressure on the market to hold down wheat prices , which have been running above Federal price support levels . Yet , they said . " We ca n't afford to get too high on prices or we cut our foreign markets . " This is a feeling generally shared by Midwest farmers , who now see foreign exports for dollars climbing and want to keep it that way . Prices bring up production costs . Bruce Russell of the National Farmers Company of Omaha , which manages more than 2,600 farms for owners in the Midwest , said " the squeeze still is on . " Fertilizer , the magic ingredient that has helped explode production on fewer acres , is the only item that has remained about the same in the last five years , he said . Tractor Price Rises A tractor that sold for $6,000 five years ago is up to about $9,000 . A two-row corn picker that cost $2,500 five years ago is $3,500 now . A wheat combine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although the machinery now is more elaborate and has air-conditioned cabs . In many areas heated arguments are going on over taxes . Property taxes have climbed and set off political repercussions . Nebraska has two referendums on the ballot this year , one to repeal a state in come tax that the one-house Legislature voted a year ago and another , initiated by the State Farm Bureau , to kill the state property tax . The income tax would be the first time Nebraska had one . This fight will figure in Democratic Gov . Frank B. Morrison 's battle to unseat Republican Senator Carl T. Curtis and Democratic Lieut . Gov . Philip Sorensen 's race against a Republican newcomer . Norbert Tiemann , for Governor . These are seats President Johnson would like to win . Kenneth Gridley of Montgomery County , Iowa , said that , between interest and taxes , " it 's $30 an acre before we put the crop in . " And " if you build a building . " he complained , " the assessor is out there before you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lit a group at an auction barn , , broke into a discussion with this : " Before you tell me how much steaks cost back East and how consumers have more votes than we do , let me tell you about some basic costs . Calf Costs Cited " I buy a 400-pound calf at 30 cents a pound and ' that 's low . I got some at 34 cents . So I pay $120 for the calf . I 've got to pay interest , for the corn , protein , hay , veterinarian and shipping , That all adds up to about $250 . If I sell him at 1,000 to 1,100 pounds at say 25 cents a pound I get back $250 . If the market is good at 28 cents I get $280 . How 's that for a return on my farm investment of about $40,000 ? " At Winterset , Iowa , Willis Fletcher , who operates 1,000 acres of corn , soybeans , hay , cattle and sheep , said : " Livestock prices are holding up pretty good but I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conserving on every corner I can . I 've lost a lot of confidence in the whole structure of things . I 've been a confirmed Democrat but lately I 've had a scared feeling and started thinking . This is a concern with the whole world situation and has nothing to do with personal gain . " In Lincoln County . Kan .. another Democrat , a wheat and cattle farmer , John Becker , had a brighter view . " Farmers are used to a tight squeeze , " he said . " In the end , farmers still count the money in their pocket . " In the Midwest , both Republican and Democratic officeseekers are counting on that .
