THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment H me 881 , which the Marines arduously captured last May , is now so effectively surrounded by enemy forces that the only way onto it or off it is by air . Helicopter rescue operations draw fire from below . Not all the men who need more than routine medical care can be airlifted to where care is available . Because evacuation of the wounded is so hazardous , the Marines who arc holding Hill 881 know that to he wounded may cost thjm their lives . Ordinarily , our military forces are not supposed to fly the American flag over such a territory-except in combination with the flag of the Republic of South Vietnam , but , we heard on radio station WNEV1/4. - the other day , the American flag is flying alone over Hill 881 . The newscaster quoted Marines there as saying , " We paid for this hill with our blood . We 're going to fly our own flag . " He said the flag they were flying had become tattered .

Like its precursor that withstood the British bombardment of Fort McHenry , in Maryland , in 1814 , its broad stripes and bright stars stream raggedly in the perilous night . Later in the broadcast , an unidentified major in the battalion that is holding the hill made a diffident appeal  --  if such it might be called  --  to the American public via the news media . " Maybe somebody will send one , " he said to newsmen . " Well , Major , " the newscaster appended , in what sounded like a heartfelt ad lib , " I suspect that right at this moment someone  --  perhaps many som eon es  --  is busy filling that order . " As has been happening often lately - nes re when we listen to the news , we found ourself reaching over to snap off die radio .

On the other hand , wc expect we 'd now have a hard time explaining to the major why we were n't among the package-senders . Like the new radicals , he has tried to appropriate the flag 's complex and powerful symbolism  --  to make of it , as philosophers say , " sufficient motive " for a particular course of action . We do n't like the idea of having to choose between two loaded versions of the flag . We do n't believe that the flag should be degraded to express antagonism to the government 's behaviol Nor should that behavior he enveloped in it , so that substantive opposition seems an affront to the flag itself .

Since such territories have not tended to remain securely and permanently either in the enemy 's hands or in our own , one must actually decide how many lives it is worth to gain ephemeral control over them . Strategic consequence , in the purely military sense , is only one factor in that decision , which must also take into account innumerable " psychological " ( or propaganda ) effects here at home , in Saigon , in Hanoi , and in friendly and hostile capitals throughout the world . To inject protection of the flag of the United States into these considerations at once complicates and simplifies Mattcrs horrendously .

" The major 's men may be wounded and without hope of evacuation , but you appear to indicate they 'll have plenty of reason to hold on to the hill , " we said . " Yeah , I guess our listeners could hear the music in the background , " the WNEW man said . We asked what mu- , sic he had in mind . " You know , " he said " The music . " After we hung up , we realized , with sudden sadness , what imaginary tulle they must have heard , and what splendid sight they must have conjured up . The rockets ' red glare .

" We got to a couple of the lectures , which Dr. Lettvin , who is six feet tall and weighs two hundred and seventy pounds , conducted in a well-tailored dinner jacket , and after the series had ended , we approached him early one morning at the Museum for a peripheral chat . He was wearing a pea-green sports shin with its sleeves rolled up to the el bows , and no tie ; his hair was long and wavy ; his expression was benign ; and he was accompanied by an attractive lady in a miniskirt , who turned out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly popular lectures before , " he said , over coffee thoughtfully provided by the Museum .

The nature of the color scene is a very old story , which scientists have always studied . Unlike form , the spectrum can be measured so accurately that it 's a delight . The trouble about discussing color with the layman is that you tend to take it for granted that your audience understands things you have taken for granted since you learned about them , a couple of years ago . I detected a good many glazed expressions on the faces of my listeners during the first lecture , but I think things went better during the others . " Dr. Lettvin smiled and went on , " I 'm probably the only professional dilettante in my field who has merely an M.D. degree .

I wanted to he a poet , but my mother wanted her son to he a doctor . " Next came an interneship at the Harvard Nerve Center of Boston City Hospital , and then thirty months in the Army , where Dr. Lettvin ended up as head of the neuropsy-chiatry service at the 237th General Hospi-tal during the Battle of the Bulge . In 1948 , he became senior psychia-trist at Manteno State Hospital , in Illi-nois .

I had a locksmith friend make me some master keys , and I 'd walk through with a bunch of thirty or forty of them and hand them to people , so they could escape . Let me give you a case in point . I once leafed through the folder of a man who had been there seven years . He 'd been arrested for drunkenness in a park and committed to Manteno as an alcoholic . Alcoholics were generally given clerical work and released after a month , but he 'd been labelled schiz-ophrenic . No doctor had examined him for years .

There is no room for the scholar . The children have been driven to ask what the purposes of education are . Most of them do n't want to have anything to do with it . The situation has been made critical by the abominable treatment of the Negro . I have advanced at M.I.T. the notion of mutual aid , rather than competition , among students .

So I 'm staying with the kids , instead of concentrating on research , and I 'm devoting a lot of time to supporting Senator McCarthy , in order to defeat the present tyranny that we 're under . " We asked Dr. L. where he was staying , and he said the Museum had put him and his wife up at the Hotel Stanhope . " My husband thinks that it 's too posh and that the money could he better spent another way , " Mrs. Lettvin said . " I 'm sure lie 's right , but I must say I 've enjoyed it .

" Bennett Shoqv THE other day , we spent a happy and instructive morning in the gallery of the Berg Collection , at the Public Library , inspecting an " Arnold Bennett : The Centenary of His Birth " display of some three hundred exhibits , arranged in forty-two glass cases and accompanied by a hundred and fifty-seven captions ( many of them small essays ) written by the late John D.

" A July , 1895 , Yellow Book , opened to Bennett 's first serious piece of fiction , a short story called " A Letter Home .

The Berg Collection , we were told , has the biggest Bennett holdings anywhere , including four hundred and fifty individual manuscripts and typescripts and as many letters , to and from Bennett , and the public seems to have been enjoying the show . The Long-Winded Lady OUR friend the long-winded lady has written to us as follows : " The ailanthus , New York City 's hack-yard tree , has been appearing around Broadway lately . ' Appearing ' is the exact word , because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beyond the vacancy left by the old brownstone houses that are coming down one two three four five these days . From the north and from the south and froin the east , Office Space is advancing on Broadway , and the small side streets west of Sixth Avenue are going fast . Behind the old houses , only shreds remain of the original hack yards or gardens , but when the houses come down the ailanthus appears  --  the tenacious ailanthus , growing up , well nourished , in its scrap of earth . The first of the Broadway ailanthuses I saw appeared on Forty-ninth Street , beyond the empty hole left by the brownstone where the gypsies used to he . The gypsies had had the first floor of the house , and they had taken over the front steps as well . The old house had n't been changed much , and nine worn steps with iron treads led up to the entrance . Somebody had made the ascent narrower and easier with low iron railings , and on summer nights the gypsies congregated there , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railings while the small gypsy children swung and tumbled about on the railings . When I looked across the street one day , after the wreckers had been at work on that block for quite a while , and saw the ailanthus  --  two ailanthuses , in fact -- I was startled , and I stood and looked at them , and said to them , silently , ' Were you there all the time ? ' That first day , the two ailanthus trees were green under a blue November sky . It was sixty-five degrees that afternoon , unseasonable weather , but the ailanthuses accepted the warm sunshine serenely , and made shadows of themselves against the high , blank wall beyond them . The Forty-ninth Street ailanthus trees are skeletons now  --  thin skeletons , meticulously defined by the blank wall , which juts out from the hack of one of the Sixth Avenue buildings . The trees will soon be gone , and so will the blank wall , because that area between Forty-ninth and Fiftieth is being flattened to make way for the latest Rockefeller office building , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Building , according to the Times . On these Broadway side streets , where the architecture is so mixed and often so unfortunate , the brownstones , the handsomest houses of them all , come down the most quickly . One minute the brownstone is standing , deserted , stripped , and empty , and the next minute its roof is gone and its front is gone and its insides are showing , daylight streaming like cold water over curved staircases and papered walls and small interiors  --  doors and ceilings and corners that remain secret even with everybody hooking at them . Then , when it is all over and the house is gone and the thick white dust has settled , there is the ailanthus , speaking of survival , and of ordinary things . These days in New York , when Order and Chaos shadow each other so closely that it is hard to tell the difference between them , the ailanthus stands up like a sign of reality , .

There used to he hundreds of restaurants , of every nationality and of varying degrees of charm and atmosphere and price . What all those restaurants had in common was that each place was owned by the man who stood behind the bar , or by the man who stood behind the cash register , or by the man who came forward to meet you when you walked in . We ordinary New Yorkers were ldngs and lords in all those places , even where the owner pretended to be surly , even where he really was surly . We could pick and choose and find our favorites , and so enjoy one of the normal ways of making ourselves at home in the city .

New York does nothing for those of us ' Who are inclined to love her except implant in our hearts a homesickness that babes us until we go away from her , and then we realize why we are restless . At home or away , we are homesick for New York not because New York used to be better and not because she used to be worse but because the city holds us and we do n't know why .

Other cities are mysterious . Amsterdam and London and Hong Kong are mysterious . Rome and Berlin are mysterious . New York is not mysterious . New York is a mystery . What is this place where Chaos stretches and sits down and makes himself at home ? We live here , and we become part of the mystery . With Chaos , we make ourselves at home . We find our way about , and establish a daily life for ourselves . But more and more the architecture of this city has nothing to do with our daily lives .

The newly depressed areas of our city are very rich . " At this moment , I am sitting at a table in the English Grill and I am looking out into Rockefeller Plaza . The Promenade Cafe is bright and cheerful , with the vaguely institutional air common to restaurants run by remote control  --  restaurants where the host is not the owner . It is a henign institutionalism , not had at all once you get used to it . Sitting here by the big glass wall , I am a part of the crowd outside in the Plaza . The Plaza is spectacular , with its stone terraces anti stone steps , and with the long and lingering vistas of stone and light and shadow that occur between and through the surrounding towers of Rockefeller Center .

And the ailanthus is wild . It grows like a weed . There are no weeds in Rockefeller Plaza . The Plaza is monumentally correct in every detail , and its key monument , the massive john D. Rockefeller , jr. , memorial stone , has not a scratch on it , not even a smudge . The memorial stone is a huge , severely cut wedge of polished dark-green marble , and it is set into the top of the steps at the eastern end of the skating rink . The side of the stone facing the rink bears a has-relief in bronze of Mr. Rockefeller 's head , and , underneath : JOHN D.

' To anyone approaching the stone from Fifth Avenue , the engraved words stare out with the dark and awful command of a prophecy . Here are Mr. Rockefeller 's words : I BELIEVE I believe in the supreme worth of the individual and in his right to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . I believe that every right implies a responsibility ; every opportunity , an obligation ; every possession , a duty . I believe that the law was made for man and not man for the law ; that government is the servant of the people and not their master . I believe in the dignity of labor , whether with head or hand ; that the world owes no man a living but that it owes every man an opportunity to make a living . I believe that thrift is essential to well ordered living and that economy is a prime requisite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business or personal affairs . I believe that truth and justice are fundamental to an enduring social order . I believe in the sacredness of a promise , that a man 's word should be as good as his bond ; that character  --  not wealth or power or position  --  is of supreme worth . I believe that the rendering of useful service is the common duta of mankind and that only in the purifying lire of sacrifice is the dross of selfishness consumed and the greatness of the human soul set free . I believe in an all-wise and all-loving God , named by whatever name , and that the individual 's highest fulfillment , greatest happiness , and widest usefulness are to be found in living in harmony with His will . I believe that love is the greatest thing in the world ; that it alone can overcome hate ; that right can and will triumph over might . - JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER . JR .
