txt TheUnited States Chamber of Commerce called on employers today to furnish post-retirement health insurance care for all employes to ward off " a ! compulsory system financed by ! higher Social Security taxes . " The chamber said it was adopting this new policy because the issue , of providing medical care for the aged ; through Social Security was sure ? to come up again in Congress next year . " Successful private plans will provide the chamber with the evidence it needs to combat the compulsory approach , " the chamber said . The organization noted that it had helped to defeat such a Social Security health plan in Congress this year . The organization , publishing its views in its weekly newsletter , " Washington Report , " said post-retirement health care should be provided for employes already retired and also for present employes against the time they retired . It is better to have contented former employes working as " ambassadors of goodwill " for a company , the chamber said , than to have them " disgruntled and bitter " because some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this reason , the eco- nomic Ivell-being of your re : , tired worker should be of concern to you , " the chamber said. !

" Mr. Cruikshank said the chamber 's advice appeared to be directed at employers who have refused to establish private health insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to do for political reasons what they would not do for humanitarian reasons , " he declared . The best private old-age health insurance plans , he said , cover only employes with long and continuous service , do not cover widows after the deaths of retired employes , put a ceiling ? on total benefits and cut off workers who become unemployed . Mr. Cruikshank said the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations was not opposed to private health plans , and in fact ' had helped negotiate most of them with employers . But he said the federation believed that such programs would not solve the old-age health problem so fully or cheaply as a plan favors a plan financed by higher taxes on employers and employes under the Social Security system .
