txt Crown Princess Beatrix was married today to Claus von Amsberg , but the traditional glitter of a royal wedding was marred by smoke bombs hurled by youths protesting the wedding . The 28-year-old heir presumptive to the throne and the 39-year-old German commoner , who became a Prince of the Netherlands , never showed , in four hours before the public , that they knew of the band of youths harrying the wedding . The youngsters , estimated by the police at 1,000 , tossed seven or more homemade ' smoke bombs and made halfhearted attempts to push into the route of the royal procession . There were almost 8,000 soldiers and policemen on guard . One smoke bomb went off as the golden coach carrying the bridal couple approached West Church and a second as they left it .
