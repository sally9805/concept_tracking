txt American economic news is so good that it has got government economists frightened . The gross national product made the largest quarterly advance in history in the first quarter . " Unwelcome ! " says Arthur M. Okun , chairman of the President 's Council of Economic Advisers . ? Real output grew at a phenomenal annual rate of 6 percent . " Unsustainable ! " he declares . Annual growth rate of consumer consumption is at a " fabulous " 9 percent . " The most worrisome development of all , " he cries . With a rising crescendo of alarm , government economists have been warning that the present growth rate should be braked by a tax increase . They ca n't seem to catch the public 's ear . Credit more costly To put teeth in Mr. Okun 's warning , the Federal Reserve Board raised the discount rate ( the cost at which member banks borrow money ) to 51 , percent . It was the second increase in little more than a month . The ultimate effect is to make credit cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like a man who vainly tells other passengers that the car is going too fast , a note of desperation is coming into Mr. Okun 's warnings . Once again he has delivered what in effect is a cry for help , in a formal speech before the National Press Club . His predecessor , Gardner Ackley , began giving the same warning 15 months ago in August , 1967 , when the first plea went to Congress for higher taxes to curb demand and avoid inflation . Congress has n't acted . Inflation is n't around the corner ; it 's here ? now , Mr. Okun said this past week . Prices are bounding up at a 4 percent annual rate . Inflation has brought private interest rates to 6 percent ( a dangerous level for home construction ) , and because of higher costs , " our net exports have nose-dived , " Mr. Okun said . Mr. Okun , a 39-year-old economic " whiz kid " who graduated from Columbia at the head of his class and is top administration economist , has a note of frustration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , rarely in history , it seems in Washington , has the American public been so confused and divided -- over Vietnam , over race relations , over economics . What Mr. Okun is trying to tell the nation , apparently without much success , is that inflation as a danger is on a par with the other two . Mr. Okun tries to keep an I-told-you-so note out of his voice in pointing out that the present dangerous situation ? was forecast by the Council of Economic Advisers last August . Ruefully he congratulates his experts for what , he says , may have been // *Too much good news ' alarms economist // " a lucky guess , " but he adds , " The nation was unlucky that we were right and that our advice for higher taxes was not heeded promptly . " Young Mr. Okun is in no.position to challenge veteran chairman Wilbur D. Mills of the House Ways and Means Committee for sitting on Mr. Johnson 's proposed 10 percent surtax . But he leaves little doubt that in. his own view if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for it . Straitjacket ' opposed The tax surcharge wo n't end inflation , he acknowledges , but the nation has got to begin practicing self-restraint somewhere . The problem is starkly simple , he says : " When the nation tries to spend more than it can readily produce , the excess spills over into inflation . " Too many dollars are chasing too few goods . Answering questions , Mr. Okun said he " has n't spent 10 minutes " in thinking about wage-price controls ; he repudiates them as a " straitjacket . " The negative income tax ? ? " an important idea that this society has to take very seriously even with a smile if Milton Friedman conservative economist of the University of Chicago is for it . " The administration budget is already " stringent , " he told a questioner ; nevertheless this is no time for " a stalemate " with Congress ; the White House is ready to compromise ; " the next move is up to the House of Representatives . " Foot on accelerator In his text Mr. Okun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation in bad times but not today . " Too much good news is bad news , " he said . He used words like " buoyant , " " sensational , " " fabulous , " " shattering , " and " whopping . " His metaphor was a car going 70 miles an hour and the driver pressing the accelerator . " It 's not an investment boom , or a defense boom , or a housing boom , or a consumer boom , " he said , " but it adds up to an overall boom . Or if it is not a boom , it is surely the most vigorous and the most dangerous nonboom that this economy has ever experienced . " Mr. Okun looks young and troubled as he stands before a microphone and he speaks hurriedly and defensively as perspiration gathers on his forehead . He is trying to tell the nation something . Is any- , body listening ?
