One day last February , trim , 29-year-old Geraldyn Cobb packed a single suitcase , said goodbye to her fellow workers at Aero Design and Engineering Co. in Bethany , Okla. , and left for a supposed week 's vacation with her parents in Ponca City , 90 miles away , Jerrie Cobb never reached home . <P> Last week Jerrie 's strange disappearance was explained in Stockholm by Dr. W. Randolph Lovelace II , chairman of the Special Committee on the Life Sciences for Project Mercury , the U.S. astronaut program . Jerrie Cobb had spent her " vacation " in Albuquerque , N. Mex. undergoing a brutal battery of 75 separate physical and psychological tests . She was jabbed with an electric needle , rocked back and forth on a tilting table to test her circulation . Her sense of balance was measured by squirting cold water into her ear canals to induce dizziness . Psychologists peppered her with 195 questions ( sample : " Do you wish you were dead and away from it all ? " ) , evaluated her ability to adjust to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of humor . The result , according to Dr. Lovelace : she had qualified to " live , observe and do optimal work in the environment of space , and return safely to earth . " Jerrie Cobb had become the first U.S. lady astronaut . <P> Planks on the Pedals . A slender ( 5 ft. 7 in. , 121 lbs. ) blonde , Jerrie demonstrated a point that many scientists have long believed : that women may be better equipped than men for existing in space . Reported Project Mercury 's Lovelace : women have lower body mass , need significantly less oxygen and less food , hence may be able to go up in lighter capsules , or exist longer than men on the same supplies . Since women 's reproductive organs are internally located , they should be able to tolerate higher radiation levels . <P> The first astronautrix ( measurements : 36-27-34 ) eats hamburgers for breakfast , is an old hand at airplanes , with more air time-over 7,500 hrs. - than any of the male astronauts . The daughter of a then Air Corps captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she was just twelve years old . " Dad fastened 12 in. planks on the pedals so I could reach , " she explains . <P> Now advertising and sales-promotion manager for Aero Design , Bachelor Girl Cobb flew a twin-engined Aero Commander in 1957 to 30,361 ft. , a world altitude record for a plane of its class , last year piloted another Commander over an official 2,000-kilometer course at an average speed of 226,148 m.p.h. for another class record . " She 's calm as hell in a plane , " says an Oklahoma pilot . " There 's no fumbling with the radio dials for new frequencies , no fluttering of charts . She 's the best organized girl pilot I 've ever seen-and the most feminine . "
