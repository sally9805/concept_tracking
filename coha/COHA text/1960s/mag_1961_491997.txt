The place where Archie Adirin fell into the Arctic Ocean has an improbable name  --  Liz C. As usual , the water was about thirty-three degrees above zero . So was the air . Archie took a fifteen-foot , unplanned dive from the bow ramp of the Peyaka , a onetime tank lighter converted to a power barge , and for a few seconds the whole affair was mildly funny . The Peyaka was anchored , and a convenient ladder was only a few feet from where Adirin came up , spitting salt water . But the humor vanished . Skipper John Covey was the first to realize that Adirin already was so shocked he could not pull his own weight out of the water . Covey quickly lowered a pole , then ran aft with the man in the water clinging to the pole 's end . When he reached a spot where the Peyaka 's outer deck is only a couple of feet above the water , other crewmen grabbed Adirin 's shoulders and hauled him aboard . He trembled with shock for an hour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he had stayed in the icy water another five minutes , almost certainly he would have died . Although Adirin still views arctic water with cautious respect , his experience reallywas not exceptional in the Arctic Resupply Mission for Distant Early Warning Stations in Alaska . This mouth-filling title describes an annual attempt by a few bearded civilians to outrace winter , outwit polar ice and float awkward ships where really there is n't enough water to keep ships afloat . If they succeed , everybody gets home , a profit is realized , and men in some of the most isolated spots on earth get enough supplies to make their winter fairly comfortable . If they fail , the winter on the DEW Line can be long and miserable , profits can vanish , and shipscan end as derelicts crushed in the ice , their crews requiring rescue by helicopter or dog teams from the frozen sea . In this annual cliffhanger of the Far North , Archie Adirin and about thirty men like him were actors last year . The stars were John L. ( Jack ) Bullock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done , and Ronald Riley , a sometime Oregon logger , who did it . Delivery of supplies for the DEW Line has been a major problem ever since these multiple radars were established in the 1950 's to warn the North ( Continued on Page 78 ) Contirtuedfrono Page 76 ) in the room , and Fred Durkin is sitting on it , or he was when I left , and Orrie ( " tither was sitting on a pile of paper . One of the men has a lump on the side of his head where I hit him with my gun , but he 's not hurt much . I gave the superintendent another twenty dollars . That 's the situation , " Paul Hannah had started to rise , but hands on his shoulders had stopped him  --  Stebbins on the left and Leach on the right .

" As you see , gentlemen , 1 was faced with a dilemma , since he was both a counterfeiter and a murderer . Preferring not to choose , I asked you both to come and I leave the question of priority to you . Since Mr. Cramer has him under arrest ? " The movement that interrupted him was by Paul Hannah , but it was n't much of a movement , Apparently his idea was to lunge at Wolfe , but Stebbins and Leach had him pinned . They glared at each other , and Hannah glared at Wolfe , and Hattie Annis ' voice came from the couch . " You see , Falstaff ? Did n't I tell you ? " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later Wolfe and I were in the office disagreeing about something when the doorbell rang . It was Hattie . I escorted her in , and she sat in the red leather chair , opened her handbag and took out a little package wrapped in brown paper . Wolfe made a face . I thought , Good grief she 's found another one . But she reached into the bag again and came out with an envelope that recognized . " This check you sent me , " she said . " You say in your letter it 's for my share of the reward , a hundred dollars . So you kept-your share ? " " Yes , " Wolfe lied . " Did you get yours , Buster ? " " Yes , " I lied . " Then that 's all right . But what about this bill ? Five thousand dollars as a fee for services and six hundred and twenty-one dollars and sixty-five cents for expenses . What did I tell you that day , Buster ? Did n't I say I could pay forty-two thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here it is . " She tossed the package onto Wolfe 's desk . " A man at the bank helped me pick those bonds , and he says there 's none better . These arc transferred to you . This is the first time 1 ever let any of them go , and I hope it 's the last : but it was worth it . That was a day , the best day I 've had since my father died . I did n't like it when I saw in the paper that Hannah had confessed , but that was n't your fault , I 've got no use for anybody that confesses anything to the cops . That Paul Hannah was no good . He even told them how he stole the car and tried to kill me with it because he thought 1 had the package and knew who put it in my parlor , and he saw Tammy across the // street and knew she saw him ; and when he went back to the house , she was at the phone dialing a number , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got near her and she stood up he stabbed her , and then he carried her into the parlor and left her there with her skirt up to her waist . He was no good . I 'll have to be more careful about people that want a room . " Wolfe was frlawning . Finally he said , " 1 ca n't accept those bonds , mad  --  Miss Annis . Not all of them . I prefer to evaluate my services myself . I did so and sent you a bill . " She nodded . " I tore it up . The day I told Buster that , that settled it . I hired you and I said what I could pay . Now you say you wo n't accept it . That 's no way to do . " Wolfe looked at me . I grinned . He pushed his chair back and arose . " I have a matter to attend to , " he said . " I 'll leave you with Mr. Goodwin . You understand each other . " He marched out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around , and she told me twice not to call her Hattie . American continent of aerial attack . The stations spread from the low arctic coast of Alaska to Greenland at intervals of about 100 miles , with small relay points between ; and every plank , electronic device , gallon of fuel and can opener must be brought to them . Planes , tractor trains and ships were used in building the DEW Line , the work proceeding in winter at sixty below , and in summer among swarms of mosquitoes . In winter the shallow , frozen sea pushes 100-foot ridges of pressure ice against the shore ; in summer the swampy tundra is impassable . Makeshift airfields permit delivery of fresh food and mail most of the year , but the small planes able to use them can not carry significant weights of steel or oil . Tractor trains inching over the frozen tundra are slow and expensive . Thus , for resupply , the Air Force personnel , Canadians and United States civilians who occupy the five-to-fifty-man posts must depend on sealifts in summer . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of getting dry cargo and fuel to places where , for the most part , no ships had been before . They delivered . but at tremendous expense . In the summer of 1957 , for example , a task force of the Military Sea Transportation Service , supplying stations from the Chukchi Sea to Tuktoyaktuk , Northwest Territories , mustered forty-six vessels  --  seven tankers as well as cargo carriers , a command ship , four icebreakers and three salvage vessels . Eleven hundred soldiers went along as stevedores . In one spot underwater demolition teams used twelve tons of explosives trying to break up ice packed against the shore . But they were repelled at ten different landing sites and had to leave their cargo for winter tractor trains . Nevertheless , the fleet went all the way to Tuktoyaktuk and back with only minor damage . Its people were rightfully proud  --  until a bumptious man with some towboats spoke out . The man was Jack Bullock , a large , blue-eyed ex-soldier , ex-miner and exmail-boat hand who in 1957 had made some deliveries along the Bering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of tugs , barges and about thirty-five men he would do everything the huge MSTS expedition had done between Cape Lisburne and Beaufort Lagoon , some 700 miles across the top of Alaska . He would do it  --  on a no-delivery , no-pay basis  --  without frogmen , tankers , helicopters or furor , between the departure of shore ice in early summer and the bleak autumn day when the ice returned . There were people , private and official , who decided Jack Bullock must be out of his mind , and some still think so . But he got some capital to bolster his small tug fleet , operating out of Kotzebue , and formed Alaska Barge and Transport , Inc . This company won a contract from the Army Transportation Corps and the Alaska joint military command . The unofficial attitude was , let these wild men try it ; we always can bail them out by whistling up the Navy  --  whose fleet was kept on stand-by , just in case . So with pick-up crews and leased equipment , Bullock went to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry cargo usually is loaded at Seattle , while bulk petroleum is transshipped at Dutch Harbor in the Aleutians . Bullock 's principal equipment is the nameless , 299-foot Barge 539 , with room for 8375 long tons of cargo and 3,075,000 gallons of bulk fuel . This vessel carries its own cranes and houses its crew during unloading in a big house trailer parked on the stern . A 4000-horsepower tug , the Winquatt , tows this monster . The power barge Peyaka churns along as lighter , thirty-two-ton freighter and towboat . Some smaller barges and floating oil tanks and a little single-engined tug  --  fine for pushing ice cakes  --  complete the fleet . A second large tug sometimes goes on independent missions . Last August , in the uncertain dusk of a Point Barrow evening , Bullock 's fleet lay a quarter mile off the black sand beach , nothing to the north of it except hummocks of floe ice , poised a mile or two off shore . Beyond the anchored Barge 539 nothing moved except individual ice cakes marching slowly toward the east , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , and a few misguided ducks , flying low over the sea . On the beach a fringe of phalaropes palpitated over a floating fuel hose leading from the barge to a pipeline on shore . The Peyaka slowly pushed toward shore a small barge loaded with boxes , steel and lumber . But in the last few minutes the wind shifted . Now the Peyaka 's way was barred by a 100-foot belt of ice jammed against the beach . Into this the barge crunched , then stopped . The Peyaka 's five big propellers dug deeper , but the ice only shifted slightly . The impasse was resolved by the Polar Bear , a bruised thirty-foot tug with an Eskimo skipper , Richard Curtis . Curtis moved in between the barge bow and the shore , nosed against the nearest ice cake and opened his throttle . The Polar Bear shoved , climbed the nearest cake with its bow , teetered and fell off backward , leaving a line of rust and a splatter of diesel fuel . Once more Curtis attacked , and once more the Polar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ice moved , cake grinding against cake , and the Polar Bear widened a little slice of open water . The fourth and fifth tries opened the lead more , and the Peyaka shoved its barge into the hole until it grounded on the beach . From the shore a bulldozer piled sand to create a temporary ramp from beach to barge deck ; and from the deck , three unlikely vehicles rolled down . One was a curious truck-monster which operates on soft rubber balloons in place of wheels a rolligon See LOOK , MOM  --  NO WHEELS ! June 6 , 19551 ? the others were wide-track variations of Caterpillar trucks . Fiercely bearded drivers with eyes red-rimmed from sleeplessness  --  tug crewmen now working for overtime pay  --  stepped down into the bitter wind to shake hands with a parka-shrouded beachmaster . This was Ron Riley , the onetime Oregon logger , steamship agent and cranberry-bog owner . With Bullock tied down in Washington State by other business , this year 's arctic resupply was Riley 's baby . Charles ( Chuck ) Daley , in charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Eskimo and an Alaska state legislator , climbed up to start the engine of a cherry-picker crane . Riley said , " All right , let 's go . " A mile away the domes of a DEW Line control station stood out above the tundra . A lone checker looked at his watch as the first cargo moved , then stared at the sea ice , now moving a little closer . Almost half the arctic resupply had been completed in the west , but another 400 miles of deliveries lay ahead to the east . The fleet , which had left Seattle June thirtieth , was five days behind schedule by August seventeenth . Cargo at Point Barrow moved twenty-four hours a day , with sleep postponed until the fleet could go to sea again . Riley brought in extra Eskimo crews to make up lost time . Breakdowns and cargo confusion frustrated his efforts . A section of a prefabricated building had to be carried back to an isolated base to the west because it had been overlooked . A weary crane operator banged a slingload into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice , blown away by one wind , was blown back by the next , again blocking the beach . A whiplash man who maintains good humor even without sleep , Riley ordered the Peyaka to the east . If it could deliver oil , lumber , steel ancra portable building to a small station called POW A , while the rest of the fleet continued to unload , he might save a day . So John Covey , a three-season arctic veteran at twenty-nine maneuvered the Peyaka away from the fleet , towing a sixty-foot floating oil tank . It came ( Continued on Page 80 ) ( Continued from Page 78 ) obediently for a few yards , then headed off to the left , almost as if independently steered , until it was stopped by the tow cable , now at a sharp angle off the Peyaka 's stern . The oil barge then reversed itself , heading to the right until once again the tortured cable snubbed it . Covey uttered definite words about keelless barges . " That thing , " he said , " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had was knocked cockeyed a week ago : ' The Peyaka turned northeast from Point Barrow . Here the North American continent ends in a whimper of sand , its only feature a wooden tepee to guide navigators . Drifting ice cakes were all around before the Peyaka reached the point . Masses of cakes were ahead , no visible water path between them , as the vessel came abreast of the Plover Islands , a series of sandspits extending eastward . A channel lies inside these islands , but its exits average only three feet deep at normal water . The Arctic Ocean has no appreciable tides , but an offshore wind can reduce the water level two or three feet in as many hours ; an onshore blow can create a tangle of ice and a three-foot water rise . Eskimo skin boats and deep wooden skiffs chugged through the channel , propelled by outboard motors . One carried twenty-five caribou carcasses as well as two cheerful Eskimos . The meat was worth fifty cents a pound at Barrow . But the channel was not for Covey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening the Peyaka moved at five knots , then at two as ice moved closer . The leads were becoming narrower , and wisps of fog were thickening . The depth finder showed fifteen feet of water under the hull , then half that as the ship passed over a bottom ridge . The Peyaka turned east and met a solid bank of fog . Out of it an iceberg half the size of a tennis court slid , crashing against the ship 's side . As it passed the stern , the vagrant barge on the towline suddenly decided to reverse its angle . Covey said , " She wants one ! " First mate Wally Proux cut the throttles . The towline slackened , but nothing could stop the barge charging down in the fog . Its bow struck the berg full on , then drunkenly slipped to one side . Covey signaled to keep the power off . " That 's enough , " he said . " If we 're going to hit them , I want to see them first . " Proux and Adirin went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their gloves and shoes broke frost on the ladders . Mercury in a bridge thermometer stood at twenty-eight degrees . Proux said , " What 's your plan , John ? " Covey shrugged . " We 'll wait . Nothing else we can do . " In the cabins , exhausted crewmen slept while the Arctic Resupply Mission lost another eight hours . The date was August twentieth . In the early morning a sea gull walked across newly frozen ice around the ship to investigate garbage thrown overboard . But the fog had lifted . The Peyaka moved , starring new ice ahead and shoving an occasional old cake aside . The uncertain leads grew narrower . The oil barge climbed another ice cake , snapping a stanchion . Swearing , Proux rigged the tow bridle on the other end , and Covey eased the Peyaka ahead . The leads vanished , and a single width of open water between the ice and the islands shrank . Bracing himself against another fall from the bow , Adirin took soundings with a long pole ? " Ten feet " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In the pilothouse Proux said , " She 's diggin ' mud , John . " Covey eased the throttles and watched astern as a brown stain welled up from the bottom past the ice cakes . The fog was back now , but as a low cloud above the water . Covey reported by radio to Point Barrow , and Riley 's tense voice presently answered , " We 'll take a look and maybe we can find you a lead . " Half an hour later the hum of a small airplane 's engines was overhead . The men on the ship could not see the plane , nor did the pilot dare to come down through the overcast . Instead , the plane ranged east . In another hour Riley was on the radio again . " Nothing , " he said . " I could n't see a lead anywhere . You might as well go back , John . " The Peyaka slowly clawed its way around and headed back . Presently it passed the garbage thrown out in the morning . The sea gull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big Barge 539 late in the day , Covey went to confer with barge-master Harry Holmes . A barge crewman voiced his personal opinion . " Last night , " he said , " some ice stove in the stem of the Polar Bear . They got it fixed , but that Wagner a tracked vehicle blowed a transmission . Nobody can fix that . You ask me , 1 do n't think we 're goin ' to make Barter Island ; and if we do get there , we ai n't goin ' to get out again . " Nobody offered any bets . Arctic Resupply now was another day late . POW A is one of the least of the DEW Line installations  --  a big antenna , relay equipment in a single building , a double line of wanigans ( shacks on sleds ) straggling toward the beach . Between the station and the shore is a quarter mile of marsh , crossed by a pipeline and a tractor road . From the air , ponds and rivulets in the tundra appear weirdly geometric around the 900-foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was glad to see a plane and visitors . " This does n't look like much , " he said , " but this station was n't intended to be manned . The idea was that the generators would run by themselves ; and every month in winter , somebody would be flown in to inspect them . But it did n't work out that way . The machinery ran all right . but the man Flown in would find all the building doors frozen shut , snow drifted in . When it was fifty or sixty below , one or two men were n't enough to dig them out . So now we have five or six here all winter . But the housing 's sorry . We 're waiting for steel to frame a new building so we all can be under one roof  --  that is , if the sealift gets here . I 'm beginning to wonder whether it will . " So were other people . At Barrow , Riley slept poorly , his dreams a confusion of broken-down gear , ice floes and key dates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly could finish unloading was ( Continued on Page 82 ) // ( Continued from Page 80 ) receding hourly toward the last date he could get his equipment west from Beaufort Lagoon to Barrow , before the ice surely would close tight against the peninsula for the winter . He also carried two other worrisome dates in his mind  --  the fleet must be west of Point Barrow by October first and out of the Bering Sea by October fifteenth , The penalty would be cancellation of marine insurance . Almost daily Riley and Don Esmay , contract pilot , took the little airplane off Barrow 's steel-mat airfield . Nothing was reassuring . Bullock 's big tug Mohawk had towed a floating dry dock all the way east to the Mackenzie River in Canada . On August twenty-first , on her way back , the Mohawk radioed that she was stuck in the ice , forty miles offshore and 100 miles east of Barrow . Days later the United States Coast Guard icebreaker Barron Island located the Mohawk , her propeller bent like a pretzel , and took her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his fleet  --  until the wind changed . Stepping out of a Barrow camp but one morning , he finally felt ? a chill breeze on his southerly cheek . An hour later the Peyaka , with her stubborn barge , was again forging around Point Barrow at a desperate seven knots . This time a narrow channel opened just off the Plover Islands , and the Peyaka sneaked through . Fifty miles southeast , at POW A , her crew snaked the end of a floating fuel hose ashore and started pumping . And Tegtmeier got his steel . Meanwhile , the Winquatt , the Polar Bear and their barges also slipped around Point Barrow : to wait for the Peyaka off POW A. But that bedeviled vessel now was against the shore with packed ice between her and open water . She finally got out with the help of the Polar Bear  --  but Arctic Resupply had lost the five hours she took to go 500 yards . Seldom is there justice . M. S. Condon and his twenty men at POW I , a large station , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They could have passed the winter comfortably even if new warehouse materials had not arrived . But Riley 's fleet had no trouble . They had less luck , however , on the Kogru River . This is the site of another relay station , POW B , and the schedule allowed one day for unloading . In the Polar Bear Riley carefully sounded a lagoon , finding just enough water for Barge 539 and for a lighter to be brought up against the shore . Confidently crews moved a single rolligon off the lighter  --  just as an offshore wind sprang up . Three hours later tugs were shoving barges out of the lagoon as fast as they could . The water level had gone down a foot and still was dropping . Riley directed the fleet to an open beach five miles away . The rolligon ashore attempted the same trip overland , but bogged down in a swamp . Five days later unloading was completed . Nothing had been lost except more time . From well out in the Arctic Ocean , the Burton Island reported by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous bergs clear out of the water . New ice was forming , and every sign indicated an early freeze-up . The date was September second . Riley still had six deliveries to make . At POW II , shore ice slowed lighterage and knocked another skeg out of line . At POW C , Barge 530 went aground when water ran out ahead of another south wind . The Polar Bear got her off after forty-eight hours . The schedule had called for six hours . At POW D a pressure ridge of ice twenty feet high on the barren shore slowed deliveries from an expected seven hours to twenty . Crewmen were staggering from fatigue when they finally put to sen again . Even the totals in their overtime ledgers  --  an ordinary seaman may make more than $2000 a month during this phase of the operation  --  seemed unimportant now . What did sound important was a radio message from the Burton Island , Paraphrased , it said , " Conditions are worsening fast . All shipping east of Point Barrow should prepare to get out now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it kept going . Barter island was ahead  --  a five-day unloading job , with luck . Riley sounded a lagoon which offered the only protection . Now and then he glanced at a Navy LST , which had tried to unload some eight years ago . It was now well up on shore , battered by winters of pressure ice . The lagoon was enclosed by a scimitar of sand , with 130 feet between the point and the shore and a minimum depth of thirteen feet inside , with moorage for Barge .539 just off the point . Happily Riley directed anchoring on September eleventh . The 539 crew ran out a quarter mile of floating hose to a pipeline ashore . and others shoved a lighter against the beach . They were ready to unload . But there was a little wind out of the north . Two days later the lighter was still against the shore , held there by four straining tractors . The fuel hose now was twice as long , having been paid out to reduce the probability of snapping . Even so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel through the four-inch line : pressure of a screaming forty-knot north wind and the seas was too great on the hose 's exterior . Riley shut down the pumps , and delivery of 271,000 gallons of oil was delayed for a while . So was everything else . The wind shifted to the east , howling at forty-five knots across the curve of the scimitar . Ice gathered against the sand and was pushed up on it by other ice . Seas broke over ice and froze as they cascaded down . Then the wind shifted to the west and blew at thirty knots . When it finally died , crewmen needed no urging to go to work again . They were reeling now , eyes puffed , hands cracked . One man fell and was sent home by plane with a badly sprained hip . Others went to sleep standing up . Galleys on the tugs kept food and coffee hot twenty-four hours a day . Riley again measured the lagoon . The entrance was now thirty feet wide , and he could find no more than thirteen feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had filled it in . There was another message from the Burton Island : " Get out  --  now . " New ice was nearly a foot thick alongside the barges in the cold dawn . The date was September eighteenth . Riley sent the Peyaka and a barge fifty miles farther cast to Beaufort Lagoon . " It was part of the job , " he said later , " that we 'd come to do . " Lumber and steel , oil in barrels and oil in the pipeline went ashore , along with stoves and trucks  --  all the things which could not be handled easily by air . But by air Riley was scouting  --  first to the cast where the Peyaka had run head on into another forty-five-knot storm and was unable to make progress with its tow . Riley sent the Winqualt to take over the tow  --  another nine-hour delay . By radio the Burton Island sent its monotonous instruction : " Get out , immediately , The ice . . , . " There was n't much point in reading the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definite , message . The Burton Island said , " We can not be responsible nor help you if you do not leave immediately . " Forty-eight hours later the Peyaka and the Win quart returned from Beaufort . Nobody wasted much time . Winqualt skipper Glen Gordon hooked low cables to Barge 539 , another cable from that to a smaller barge and the Polar Bear alongside it , a third from the Polar Bear back to another barge and the Peyaka . Thus the three propellers of the Winquatt , the five slower ones of the Peyaka and the thrashing little screw of the Polar Bear all contributed to maximum speed for the whole fleet . Nobody could go very fast , but nobody was left behind . Riley took the right-hand seat of the airplane as Esmay headed once more out over the ice . Straight north there was the suggestion of a lead  --  a spot where new ice was six inches thick , but bigger cakes were reasonably far apart . Into this barrier Riley sent his fleet crashing for twenty miles . Home was south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they stuck there , they would n't get home . The fleet moved at eight knots , Riley at 150 miles an hour  --  and he finally located open water , or nearly that , for most of the necessary 400 miles west . But the lead aimed straight for the land , ffifty miles east of Barrow . At POW I , Esmay landed at ten P.M. in a pea-soup fog . The wind was from the north . When the fleet came within easy radio distance , one of the tugs sent a plaintive message : " How does it look up ahead ? " Riley is proud of his truthfulness , but men on the boats were dead tired , suffering reactions from a month of overwork , Riley 's answer said , " it looks good . " His conscience quivered . Half a dozen miles west , ice was firm against the continent , and although Riley and Esmay flew north for fifty miles , they could find no breaks . Riley said , " Pray for a south wind . " Esmay wondered why . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the current runs northwest , West of the point , it runs northeast , and those currents meet off the point . If there 's a south wind , coupled with that pressure , it just might be enough to break that ice away from the shore . It has to be . " On the morning of September twenty-eighth Riley stepped out of a shore building to feel a slight southerly breeze . Fingers crossed , he and Esmay flew over the ice once more , waggling wings at the train of tugs and barges . One pass over the ice showed nothing , and a second only left Riley 's mouth dry with waiting . But on a third trip , only a mile offshore , Esmay took the plane even lower . Like a crack in a china plate , a line was drawn through the ice . As they circled , it visibly grew wider , then wider stiff . On the radio Riley tried to keep his voice calm . " Just keep going , " he told Gordon . " A lead 's opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battered fleet of the sealift rounded Point Barrow . The navigators ' tepee was hidden behind a wall of pressure ice . Ice was solid between the ships and rounded domes of the DEW station ; ice crowded almost up to the steel-mat runway of the airfield . But there was a way through . The fleet spent twelve more hours unloading at Barrow . When it pulled away again , the route west still was open , but against the point to the north there was only ice . The wind had changed , the lead was closed , and no one seriously expected it to open again until spring . Nobody cared less than Ron Riley and his ragtag fleet . At one more stop Riley and a companion crossed a lagoon with an outboard skiff , stayed a few hours and then had to drag skiff and motor hack over ice which had formed in the meantime . Insurance men and Jack Bullock , still in his office , continued to sweat as the fleet inched through ice and then into the teeth of the worst Bering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ahead of the October fifteenth final deadline . In West Coast ports repairmen had months of work to do on battered propellers , skegs , bent shafts and abused machinery . And months would pass before Bullock , tagged as a madman for trying to make money this way four years ago , could know whether he had made any money this year . In Seattle in October , Riley took time for a short haircut before going home to Oregon , where he would attempt to make some profits of his own from his cranberry bog and his regular steamship-company job . He admitted he might never find time to go to the arctic again and he was not sure whether the gamble really had been worth while  --  the risk of ships , even of lives , " I think , " he said , " all of us just fig-ured we had a job to do  --  so we did it . "
