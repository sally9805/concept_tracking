Everyone knows Ben Jonson , Tennyson and Wordsworth , but who ever heard of Nahum Tate , Laurence Eusden , and William Whitehead ? All six men share the dignity of having been poets laureate of England , a tradition that goes back 350 years . According to the 17th and most recent laureate , John Masefield , this high post " is responsible for some of the world 's worst literature . " Masefield died last week at 88 at the country home in Abingdon where he spent most of his time . Fortunately , he had written much of his best poetry long before George V named him laureate in 1930 ( in preference to his chief rival , Rudyard Kipling ) . Already safe from obscurity , Masefield thus turned out only occasionally the dutiful doggerel that has so often been the lot of poets laureate . <P> " Boozing Brutes . " The son of a country lawyer , Masefield wrote roistering early verses peppered with adventures that he had packed into his teens . He went to sea as a cook , rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cape Horn . He went to the U.S. , where he crossed the continent as a hobo , worked in a Greenwich Village saloon and , while employed in a Yonkers , N.Y. , carpet factory , finally realized that his metier was poetry . Thus the rough , unschooled youth of 19 set out to fashion his poems not for " the portly presence of potentates goodly in girth " but for the " dirt and the dross , the dust and scum of the earth . " Such a taste was bound to shock the fastidious Edwardians , who were still doting on Tennyson . Shock them Masefield did with such long narrative poems as The Everlasting Mercy , which spoke of " painted whores " and " reeking hags " and " drunken , poaching , boozing brutes . " <P> Masefield 's pungent realism burst upon English poetry , but his worship of the sea was traditional for a maritime nation and his charming pastorals were long echoes of a yeoman past . His most famous short poem , Sea-Fever , was published with his first collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in rolling , hypnotic meter : <P> I must go down to the seas again , to the lonely sea and the sky <P> And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by . <P> Masefield , unlike his contemporaries , was also not loath to describe the unromantic side of British life . At a time when more traditional poets were writing idylls about Britain , he could write , for example : <P> Dirty British coaster with a salt-caked smoke stack , <P> Butting through the Channel in the mad March days . <P> Out of Fashion . Despite the lusty tone of much of his verse , Masefield was a gentle , mild-mannered man who thought of himself as primarily a storyteller . He was a craftsman who turned out some 70 books , including 28 of poetry , 14 novels and the rest biographies , histories and comparatively undistinguished plays . The bestialities of World War I made the romance and optimism of his work go out of fashion , for that era brought the onslaught of symbolism , Freudian introspection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his laureate role as " a happy duty , " though such eminences as Dame Edith Sitwell called his official paeans " dead as mutton . " One penned to mark a trip abroad by Queen Elizabeth : <P> Even as April 's footsteps that unseen <P> Touch upon March 's earth and make it green <P> So be the Africk visit of our Queen .
