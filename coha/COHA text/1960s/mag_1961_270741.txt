In distorting the shape of U.S. journalism , the late William Randolph Hearst wielded no instrument with more effect than the American Weekly , his peculiar contribution to Sabbath reading . A supplement parasitically attached to Hearst 's Sunday papers , and purveying what detractors called " the three Cs " ( crime , concupiscence and corruption ) , the Weekly scored a conspicuous financial success in a newspaper barony frequently awash in red ink . Right up to the Chief 's death in 1951 , the Weekly , with nearly 10 million circulation , made money . But last week , the businessmen who now govern the remnants of Hearst 's empire were jettisoning American Weekly clients right and left in a desperate effort to keep the supplement afloat . <P> Since January , the Weekly has pulled out of Sunday newspapers in five cities . It will shortly disappear from 21 more , in a deliberate retrenchment that will reduce its circulation from 8,544,535 to 4,000,000 . When this is done , the Weekly will survive only in Chicago 's American and nine Hearst Sunday papers-which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Having failed to remain first in a field of its own creation , Hearst 's supplement ' will henceforth run a distant last . <P> Science &; Sex . First or last , the Weekly has left its indelible thumb smudge on the newspaper scene . It was created in 1896 as the American Sunday Magazine , Popular Periodical of the New York Journal for use as a weapon in the mortal struggle between Hearst 's Journal and Joseph Pulitzer 's World . Pulitzer brandished a Sunday supplement of his own , the Sunday Magazine-but he had to do without the help of his imaginative Sunday editor , Morrill Goddard , 30 , whom Hearst had hired away earlier that year , along with the World 's entire Sunday staff . <P> Goddard edited the Hearst supplement according to his conviction that readers ' tastes were not much above Pithecanthropus level : " The habits of savagery have been welded into the mind and body of man for ten thousand centuries , while it is only sixty centuries that he has had more or less leisure and opportunity to develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a literate Neanderthal might enjoy , Goddard answered the question every Sunday , with stories about sex ( " The Outrageous French Bathing Suits " ) , sex cum science ( " Science Explains Why Chorus Girls Are Suffering from a Love Famine " ) , sex cum violence ( " Beat Her Lover to Death in Her Vengeful Fury " ) . The miracles of science were revealed to the supplement 's caveman readers , who were told that kisses carried a real electrical shock , that an aggressive vegetable ruled Mars , and that the earth gained weight as it flew through space collecting the debris of " dead and worn out suns , worlds and moons . " <P> Hearst himself loved the American Weekly more than its readers did . It was his pet . Not until 1917 , when an underling suggested that Hearst was missing a large source of revenue , did the supplement begin to carry advertising . And when non-Hearst newspapers begged the Chief to let them carry the Weekly too , Hearst turned them all down . His selfishness turned out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
