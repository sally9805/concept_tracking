txt Events in British Guiana on South America 's northern coast are beginning to fall more and more into the Castro pattern of goading private and Western capital interests to the breaking point of ire and in-dirrnatinn The latest move in this pat , tern was the request this lweekend by Marxist Prime Minister Cheddi Jagan that Soviet petroleum be stored at Atkinson Airport , turned over to the United States by war , time Lend-Lease agreement in 1941 . The request , reminiscent of Premier Fidel Castro 's order in May , 1960 , that British and ; United States oil refineries in Cuba should process Soviet petroleum , was turned down by United States Consul General Everett Melby in Georgetown . Cuban Tanker In Cuba , Premier Castro nationalized the British and American petroleum refineries in July , 1960 , about two months after their refusal to process the Soviet petroleum . The petroleum issue , in Cuba , which arose less than three months after Soviet Deputy Premier Anastas Mikoyan 's visit , sparked the rapid decline in United States-Cuban relations . Mr. Jagan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil tanker carrying Soviet gasoline , kerosene , and diesel fuel lay in Georgetown Harbor , ready to proceed 26 miles up the Demerara River to Atkinson . On United States refusal of the Atkinson Airport facilities , the Jagan government requisitioned the British - Dutch Shell oil installations , apparently those at New Amsterdam , 65 miles from Georgetown , and the Cuban oil tanker steamed in that direction Monday to unload its cargo of Soviet oil products . ' Strike Jars " Nat ion The Jagan petroleum gambit comes at a time when British Guiana has suffered through 10 weeks of general strike which has resulted in curtailment of food supplies , left garbage piled in the streets , and produced tensions that have left the country in a state of emergency since early May . During this period , at least two Soviet vessels and other Cuban vessels carrying petroleum and food supplies have put in at Georgetown Harbor and been unloaded by strike breakers . The food distribution has been made with highly articulate advertising of the fact that the products have come from Cuba and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democratically oriented Trades Union Council , was precipitated when Prime Minister Jagan tried to ram through his legislature a measure that would place labor unions under more rigid government control , and permit the government to determine which unions would represent workers in particular industrial plants . Marines on Hand Neither the Jagan government nor the unions have yielded position on the . issue , though the dissolving of the legislature recently automatically should postpone the question until the next convocation of the legislature . Beyond the labor aspects of the general strike is an ugly racial issue , with both of which British marines , on hand to prevent riots and violence , have to deal . Prime Minister Jagan , as head of the Peoples Progressive Party , represents Guiana 's Asian Indian population which is in the majority . The unions constitute the basic strength of the People 's National Congress , the opposition party led by Forbes Burnham , and represents iargely the colony 's Negro population .                    @
