Combat photography has become almost a commonplace , an adjunct to the 6 o'clock news and weather . A Face of War , though , has a rightful claim to be judged as art : it is a documentary in the great tradition begun by Civil War Photographer Matthew B. Brady when he took his cumbersome cameras to Virginia in 1861 . The film 's producer-director is Eugene S. Jones , a veteran television cameraman who fought with the Marines during World War II . He spent 97 days with a company of Marines in the heartland of Viet Nam . In the course of that time , more than half of Mike Company 's 135 men were killed or wounded ; Jones was wounded twice , and an assistant once . <P> What Jones and his crew caught in their cameras and microphones is a superbly balanced sampling of this war of snipers and booby traps , night patrols and burning villages , in which the enemy is almost always at hand and almost never seen . No commentator 's rhetoric comes between the audience and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the noise of what is happening - the tense silence of a patrol exploding into a racketing firefight , the terrible pleadings of wounded men , the ominous urgency of a chaplain 's sermon about death . The men of Mike Company are not identified by name until the epilogue ; by that time many of them have already established their personalities by what they say and do . <P> The excellence of A Face of War is not only in its fine camerawork but also in its sense of completeness . Its 77 minutes encompass the totality of Viet Nam combat : the fear and pain and boredom , heat and rain , rare relaxation , and uneasy meetings of East and West . The Marines are genial giants running a village clinic or delivering a baby ; they are stunned young men around the whimpering body of a mortally wounded child ; they are stone-faced juggernauts of mechanical war evacuating bewildered civilians in helicopters , methodically incinerating their houses with flamethrowers to deprive the enemy of a hiding place . <P> A Face of War grinds no axes , pleads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war of small and large necessities , braveries and sacrifices , and its record of this battleground should endure long after the agony is ended .
