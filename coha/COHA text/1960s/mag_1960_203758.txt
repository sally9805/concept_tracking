To decide how the stock market is be having , most investors carefully follow the price of their own stocks and the day-to-day movement of the Dow-Jones industrial average . But Wall Street 's market analysts watch closely for a far more telling sign : the whole pattern of the market 's trading behavior . Since the Dow-Jones average covers only 30 stocks , more can be learned by watching the overall price and volume movements of the more than 1,500 stocks on the New York Stock Exchange . If technical factors in the entire market form a pattern that is more bullish than bearish , the prices of stocks - and the averages-will eventually reflect that sentiment . <P> <P> Last week the market 's technical position looked stronger to the analysts than it has in more than a year . The market continued a three-week rise , closed for the week with a gain of 6.86 points ( at 636.13 ) on the Dow-Jones industrial average , after retreating slightly at week 's end . It also got a psychological boost when many large banks followed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5% to 4% the interest it charges its best corporate borrowers . <P> The Shorts Must Cover . But what most encouraged analysts was the fact that favorable signs were not isolated but spread across the board . For 15 straight trading sessions , more stocks advanced than declined , thus indicating bullish sentiment . For more than three weeks , stocks that set new highs for the year continued to substantially outnumber stocks that set new lows . Equally encouraging was the fact that the volume of trading expanded when the market advanced , contracted when the market declined . Volume has been healthy , topped 3,000,000 shares on several days . <P> Also a significant factor is the rise in the short position on the New York Stock Exchange , which reached 3,251,149 shares on Aug. 15 v. 3,058,303 a month earlier . In a short sale , an investor sells borrowed stock in hope that it will go down in price , enabling him to repurchase it at a lower price than he sold it . Paradoxically , a large short interest is considered bullish because those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stock they borrowed . <P> Ready for a Push . In the judgment of market analysts , all these favorable technical factors set the stage for a market advance , but the market still needs a push from improved economic conditions to pick up momentum . With the big institutional investors ( mutual funds , insurance companies ) now returning to the market and the market 's basic psychology improving , many Wall Streeters believe that the market is ready to respond to favorable news , take off on a sustained advance to new highs . Says Gerald S. Colby , partner of Boston 's du Pont , Homsey &; Co. : " The market is seeing better business ahead . It does not care what the economists are saying today . It is currently consolidating to go through 650-655 and on through its alltime high of 685.47 by year 's end . "
