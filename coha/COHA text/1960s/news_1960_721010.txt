txt WASHINGTON , Jan. ** in Washington described Premier Khrushchev 's Apeech to the Supreme Soviet today as a major propaganda effort . Its purpose , they said , IIwas to put increased pressure on the West in advance of r Icoming top-level negotiations . Diplomats thought the announcement of a unilateral cut of more than 1,000,000 men from the Soviet Union 's armed forces might step up demands for a disarmament agreement closer to Soviet than to Western ideas of what would be satisfactory . It was also believed here that appeals by the United States to its allies to strengthen their defenses  --  at least until iron-clad controls could be worked out with Moscow ? might now fall on ears increasingly deaf 4 such requests . Reaction Is Mixed The State Department sought to counter the propaganda impact of the Khrushchev speech with a statement that both welcomed and questioned the Soviet Premier 's announcement . Lincoln White , the department 's spokesman , said the proposed reduction in the Soviet Union 's " massive " armed forces " could lessen one of the causes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mr. Khrushchev had himself emphasized that the planned reduction " would in no way affect the actual power of the Soviet 's arms . " Mr. White noted that , as in past cases of announced Soviet reductions in standing armies , there would be " no verifiable means of checking " the forthcoming cutback . There will be a chance in // coming negotiations , he said , to reach agreement on controlled international disarmament . In those talks the United States will be " prepared to go as far toward safeguarded disarmament as any other country , " he said . He added that the United States hoped Mr. Khrushchev 's announcement was an indication that the Soviet Union was willing to enter the disarmament talks " in the same spirit " so that " concrete and verifiable measures of disarmament " could be agreed to . Earlier Cuts Recalled Today 's announcement of a 1,200,000-man reduction in Soviet armed forces was the fourth in recent years . In August , 1955 , Moscow reported a cut of 640,000 men ; in May , 1956 , 1,200,000 more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 300,000 were slated for release . There was no way to prove that those programs were carried out . Nor was there any accurate knowledge of how many men might have been added to the Soviet forces during that period . Civilian specialists- here are more inclined to accept the Soviet reports of reductions in military personnel than are their counterparts in the Pentagon . The latter are more skeptical of Soviet claims . On the diplomatic front there vas little question that with his uuiotincement Premier Khru ; hchev sought to picture him self and his country as being notivated by the best of intentions and goodwill . Nor was here much doubt that the qieech was aimed more at the ' est of the world than at the United States . Only last month , at a meeting If the North Atlantic Treaty ) organization in Paris , the Unitd States tried to win agreement from its allies to contribite more to the cause of joint ecurity . Several NATO parliaments are now considering defense budgets for the coming year . The feeling here was that the Soviet announcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase in defense spending , even though it seemed- clear that the SovietUnion itself was not reducing its military budget . The rest of the Soviet Premier 's long speech was not considered conciliatory here . There was , for example , his bbast that the Soviet Union now was the strongest military nation in the world . He spoke of missile superiority and of the prospect of incredible weapons to come . There was speculation that , ih stressing Soviet might , Mr. Khrushchev was answering his own critics at home , who may have expressed concern that the scheduled and past reductions were weakening the country militarily . Specialists found no note of softening by Mr. Khrushchev on the problem of Germany . For the second time in six weeks ? the first was in his speech in Budapest in December  --  the Soviet leader warned that unless the West was willing to work out peace treaties with both German states , Moscow and-its friends would sign one with East Germany . A separate treaty with East Germany , which would include the transfer to the Communist East Germans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is regarded as a threat to the Allied position in that city . In a typical comment , Senator Lyndon B. Johnson- of Texas , Democratic majority leader , said Premier Khrushchev " holds out an olive branch and at the same time tries to hit us over the head with it . " Qualified military sources expressed the view that the Premier 's statements were inaccurate and misleading . For example , experts here estimate that the Soviet armed forces wow stand at about 4,000,000 , " give or take a few thousand , " and not 3,623,000 as the Premier reported . The United States armed forces are estimated at 2,500 , - 000 , with a slight cut expected next year . Qualified sources said that if the Soviet Union was about to abandon manned bombers , as Mr. Khrushchev indicated in his statement that they were " obsolete , " the decision must have been sudden . Latest intelligence reports show that the Soviet Union has been carrying on extensive bomber flying operations . In addition , great sums have been spent to keep old bombers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been coming off the production line . Senator Stuart Symington of Missouri , leading Democratic critic of United States defense policies , said of Mr. Khrushchev 's statement : " He can cut his ground force personnel substantially and still have the largest and most mobile army in the world .
