The history of Viet Nam is full of heroines . Women often served as gen erals . In the 1st century A.D. , the Trung sisters raised an army and started a rebellion against Viet Nam 's Chinese overlords ; one of their female com manders gave birth to a child on the battlefield , then strapping her infant on her back and brandishing a sword in each hand , led her troops against the Chinese . In 248 , a 23-year-old girl put on a suit of golden armor , climbed on the back of an elephant , and led her army into the field against Viet Nam 's foreign invaders . <P> Today the most formidable and in some ways the bravest woman in South Viet Nam wears tapered satin trousers and a torso-hugging ao-dai , split from ankle to waist , and rides to meet her foes in a chauffeur-driven black Mer cedes . Instead of swords , her weapons are bottomless energy , a devastating charm , a tough , relentless mind , an acid tongue , a militant Roman Catholi cism - and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she married . She is Mme. Ngo Dinh Nhu , wife of President Ngo Dinh Diem 's younger brother and closest brain-truster . In ad dition to acting as official First Lady for the bachelor President , she is in her own right one of the two or three most powerful people in the country and in a sense embodies all its problems . <P> In any Western nation she would be a political force to be reckoned with . In an Oriental country burdened with cen turies of ignorance and bloodshed , she is probably more feared than any other man or woman - and fear under such conditions can mean power beyond ei ther respect or popularity . <P> American Ivanhoes . A fragile , ex citing beauty who stands only 5 ft. 2 in. in high heels - who has kept her girlish grace though she is the mother of four - Mme. Nhu does not look the part . To her critics she symbolizes everything that is wrong with the remote , authoritarian , family-dominated Diem regime . But if she is vain , arbitrary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dedication and courage . To some it seems that she belongs in an intrigue-encrusted 18th century court , or that she should wear the robes of a Chinese empress - or both . <P> Her only official positions are those of Deputy in the National Assembly and chief of South Viet Nam 's women 's movements , but Mme. Nhu orders around army generals , Cabinet minis ters , and even the President . Though he is often reluctant to go along with her , Diem regularly yields to her when she bursts imperiously into his study , and even allows her to countermand his own orders , because he desperately fears a public display of family friction . <P> When a group of disaffected South Vietnamese paratroopers attempted a coup against Diem three years ago , one of their first demands was that Mme. <P> Nhu be removed from the presidential palace . She was flattered by the attention , and also brags that the U.S. has tried unsuccessfully for years to get Diem to curb her power . She bitterly attacks the anti-Diem U.S. press corps in Saigon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ivanhoes " - perpetually in love with the underdog but confused about just who the underdog is.
