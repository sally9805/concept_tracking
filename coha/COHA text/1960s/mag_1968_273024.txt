EIGHTEENTH century France bequeathed to the modern world the concepts of revolution and popular democracy-and last week the French seemed bent on perilously trying to practice both at the same time . As the campaign to elect a new National Assembly got underway , rioting and violence erupted anew in cities throughout France . For a while it looked as though the explosion of police concussion and tear-gas grenades might blot out the appeals for votes by the 2,260 candidates running on broadly diverse platforms in Metropolitan France 's 470 electoral districts ( see box ) . <P> Heavy Toll . After eight days of relative calm , violence flared afresh when a 17-year-old boy , fleeing from police in a town outside Paris , jumped into the Seine and drowned . Enraged , Paris students surged from the Sorbonne and the coffee shops back onto the boulevards , rebuilt barricades and fought an all-night running battle with police . Fighting also erupted in Toulouse , Lyon , St.-Nazaire and the automaking town of Sochaux , where two townspeople were killed . The renewed rioting took a heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a time when 500,000 workers still had not returned to their plants . In his new role as Finance Minister , Maurice Couve de Murville conceded that France not only faced a budgetary deficit of $2 billion this year but might also be forced to sell some of its $5 billion gold reserves in order to meet a looming gap in its balance of payments . It all meant , explained Foreign Minister Michel Debr , that ( Quelle horreur ! ) France would have to cut back on De Gaulle 's prized nuclear strike force . <P> Seeking to head off a recurrence of full-scale civil disorders , Charles de Gaulle cracked down hard . After conferring with his ministers , he banned eleven student revolutionary groups , barred street demonstrations for the duration of the campaign , and ordered the expulsion of troublemaking foreigners ; 154 have so far been deported . Climaxing the drive , police even invaded the historic Odeon theater , which had served as a revolutionary sanctuary since May 15 . Dislodging the occupying students , who put up no fight , the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the old building , replacing them with three Tricolors . <P> Communist Tactics . The violence may well be the determining factor in the elections , which will be held in two rounds , the first balloting to take place on June 23 , with the runoff elections on June 30 . There are no foreign policy issues involved . Though there are some economic worries , the overriding immediate issue is simply who can best maintain order in France , and then , in the long run , solve the antagonisms and grievances that have been exposed in recent weeks . Fearing that De Gaulle will benefit from a backlash law-and-order vote , the Communists have redoubled their efforts to cool the situation . " Every time somebody gets socked , it 's worth at least 100 and perhaps 1,000 votes to the Gaullists , " said one ranking French Communist . To counter this , the Communists sought to project themselves as a patriotic party of moderation . " We are not adventurers ! " cried Party Boss Waldeck Rochet . In the worst moments of the revolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communists who had " barred the road to bloody adventure . " His appeal : " For peace and national independence , vote Communist .
