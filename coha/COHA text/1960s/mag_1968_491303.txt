O ne sunny day in the spring of 1964. strolling along a street in my home town of Laurel-ton , N.Y. , I blundered into an adventure and an education . The adventure carried me into a bitter conflict with people who seemed bent on turning Laurelton into a Negro ghetto . The education , an intense and painful one , taught me that feelings of brotherhood alone are not enough to solve racial problems  --  but that these problems may be settled , instead , by paying attention to some hard facts of economics . Some clergymen are by nature outgoing and community-oriented ; they give invocations at chamber of commerce meetings . turn up at garden-club luncheons . I had n't been that way . I tend to be somewhat withdrawn . wrapped up in more strictly religious work . But what I saw that day in 1964 pulled me into a peculiarly hot sector of the civil-rights battlefront . I was on my way to make a condolence call that morning . As I walked along a pleasant , treeIined suburban street , everything seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunshine . Then something suddenly struck me as badly out of harmony : In a single block . I saw live houses marked with Foe SALE signs . Laurelton is a small , pleasant , middle-class suburban community in the New York borough of Queens , not far from Kennedy Airport . Its residents take pride in the town : The streets are clean , the small lawns neat . the schools well-run and well-equipped . Partly because it is only a half hour 's commute from Manhattan , Laurelton has attracted large numbers of young professional men and their families . Its cultural life is lively . and until the mid-1960 's its social and political leanings had tended to be liberal . Jews , Catholics and Protestants lived here in harmony . Some Negroes had moved in and had been accepted . They were scattered through the town rather than being concentrated in one ghetto-like area , and the town was apparently ready to welcome more of them . Laurelton seemed to be an example of sane . sensible integration . But now . suddenly , it looked as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After living contentedly with Negro neighbors for several years , why , I wondered , were they abruptly getting out ? Back then I did n't know . But over the next several months it became clear that many white families on many other streets were suddenly growing uneasy over the presence of Negroes . I began to hear talk among my congreRants that the town was n't " what it used to he . " Laurelton , once so comfortably adjusted to integration , was growing skittish . I reacted as other preachers did . t moralized . I said the obvious things from my pulpit : that we are all children of God , that we should love one another without regard to skin color , that Negroes have as much right to houses in the suburbs as anybody else . The people listened politely , but my moralizing changed nothing . Then one night in the fall of 1964 somebody broke a basement window of a Negro 's home and tossed burning , kerosene-soaked rags inside . The lire department put the blaze out before it could damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were damaged almost beyond repaii The community 's nervousness now began to show openly . Someone shot the windows out of a Negro 's home with an air rifle . Other Negroes found garbage cans emptied on their front lawns . Some of the town 's younger people now leaped into the gathering battle . They were mainly unmarried professional people and college-age youngsters who moved in the same liberal-minded social set . They saw to it that each incident of racial bigotry was angrily reported in the local press . Believing that the local police force was unconcerned  --  although , in fact . it later made a number of arrests for vandalism  --  they formed vigilante groups to sit outside Negro homes all night . They handed out pamphlets that preached brotherhood and damned the white community for lacking it . This only made things hotter . A typical middle-class suburbanite , living his life of scrupulous and even painful respectability , does not enjoy being told , in effect . that he is a hypocrite , a racist and a white-collar hoodlum . In making these charges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are neither categorically bigoted nor categorically unconcerned ; they are just tired . They are preoccupied with jobs , commuting and mortgages  --  and with scraping up enough money to send young liberals to college . They yearn for community peace . but this does n't make them villains . Accused of villainy , Laurelton 's older , calmer adults countered with charges of their own : The hot-headed young liberals were cranks or Communists or both . The town seemed to split down the middle , with the passionate young in one camp and older " solid-citizen types , " as they sometimes called themselves , in the other . For a while I watched these developments from the sidelines , satisfying my conscience with an occasional moralizing sermon . Yet I knew that this problem was not going to yield to sermons . Inexorably , as the tensions mounted , I felt my-sell being drawn into the battle . My natural sympathies were with the outraged young , for like moat clergymen I dream of being a world saver . Yet I could see that the young were fanning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for the solid-citizen types to move in . I considered myself one of these types . Although I was a clergyman . I was also a resident of the town , with the same hopes and fears as any other resident . I lived in a modest house on a quiet street with my wife and two children . I 'd enjoyed my life here . I 'd felt that the town 's mixture of races ( about 15 percent of the population was Negro ) and its mixture of different religions and social backgrounds made Laurelton a good place to raise children . I did n't want to lose these advantages in an upheaval of racial bitterness . My journey from the lofty overview of a preacher to the involvement of a resident was completed when a garbage-can-overturning incident took place near my own home . Now I could no longer sit and watch . I invited a group of solid citizens to my office on a Tuesday night  --  civic leaders , a manufacturer , a mortgage broker , lawyers , a local officer of the National Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town needs is to be calmed down , " I told them . " The people in this room can do it . " None of us realized then how naive this pronouncement was . We still did n't know the real cause of Laurelton 's problems . We assumed that all we had to do was educate frightened whites out of their fears . Many were fleeing the town , we assumed , because they believed their real-estate values would fall as Negroes moved in . All right . we had only to show the whites that this need n't happen as long as they did n't panic . We had only to talk to them , and they would sit tight , and the two races would live together in harmony . Believing this . we formed an organization called the Laurelton Fair Housing Council . Its presidency was assumed by a cheerful , soft-spoken , level-headed young businessman named Jay Steingold . Its main weapon of attack , at first . was a speakers ' bureau . Whenever too many FOR SALE signs went up on any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we would call block meetings and send in our speakers to calm everybody down . We avoided preachments ; we tried to appeal to people 's intelligent self-interest . " Property values only go down when whites panic , " we pointed out . " Then too many houses get dumped on the market too fast , and prices fall as the supply outruns the demand . The air of panic keeps other whites from moving in . The houses are bought by Negroes . The more tolerant whites who have stayed in the neighborhood now begin to get worried as the percentage of Negroes increases . A ' tipping point ' is reached , and most of the remaining whites sell out at a loss , and what you have left is a Negro ghetto . Neither whites nor Negroes want this in Laurelton . " The speakers ' bureau seemed to be effective in the beginning . At least the violent anti-Negro incidents stopped . But the white uneasiness continued . We would calm a block down , only to find a few months later that we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing ? Slowly . very slowly , we began to get down to the real answers . I think I first saw those answers clearly at a block meeting one night that winter of 1964 . Our speaker was Fred Darwin , a radio announcer with an easy , informal manner . He gave his talk , then opened the meeting to questions and debate . A well-dressed woman in her 30 's stood up , " There are Negro . families ( al this block , " she said quiet ly , " and I hey ' re lovely-people. ! ' vc made i I Illy hlisinms to welcome them , and so have several other families , Our ai tiiiides are not the problem . " " Right , " said an intense younger man who was sitting near her . " The people on this block do n't have to he sold on integration . We 're still here , are n't we ? We 'll stay as long as we are n't afraid we 'll suddenly find ourselves isolated in a Negro ghetto . " Fred nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 'll stay as long as the tipping point is n't reached . But " " But that 's exactly the problem , " said the woman . " We 're afraid the tipping point is being reached . " " Why ? " Fred asked . puzzled . " Well , people are always telling us so . Only last week a man came to my door and told me the block would he all-Negro in four months . " " A man ? What man ? " She seemed surprised that we did n't know . " A real-estate broker , " she said . " I find a postcard in my mail almost every day . offering to sell my house , " the woman went on . " And we get phone calls , urging us to sell before it 's too late .... No matter what our own convictions might be , that kind of thing is hard to take . " E xactly , " added the intense young man . " And that is n't the worst of it . The brokers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . But from time to time people move away for perfectly legitimate reasons : they change jobs , get transferred , decide they want an apartment in the city . So a house goes on the market . And what happens then ? In this block the only prospects that brokers bring to the house are Negroes . Always Negroes. never whites . " I stared at him . " With the normal neighborhood turnover , " he went on , " that kind of operation will soon bring us to the tipping point almost automatically . So you see , there is n't much point in your talking to us . We 're with you . It 's the brokers you people should talk to . " I thought : All right , we 'll talk to the brokers . I was still full of innocent idealism . I thought almost any problem in human relations could he solved if men of goodwill would get together . So Jay Steingold and other members of our group held several meetings with the local brokers . There were half a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also sold houses in Laurelton . Of this total , we later concluded , only about a third were aggressive blockbusters ; most , though presumably well-intentioned , were just drifting with the tide of events . All of them professed not to understand what we were talking about . They were n't imposing any racial pattern on Laurelton , they said . They merely showed houses to buyers . It was n't their fault if the buyers were all Negroes . Whites simply were n't interested in Laurelton any more . " What do you expect us to do ? " they asked . " Turn Negroes away ? We ca n't . It 's against the discrimination laws. - We could n't argue with that . The brokers seemed to be acting like good citizens . What could we do ? A broker who did no business in Laurelton happened to attend the last of ! these nivelingo. , uul Iillerward he took Tal/Fil , " hr Said , /1 ( 11 1111k1r1 ( 115 .. ? I'Tt. ' a kiln ' it i the woods . its no .1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iec I s around , It 's deliberate on their park and you can prove it 140 yourself it yoll want to . I think you 'll find ( hat they advertise other communities in newspapers like The Nero York Times , but that when they have a listing in Laurelton , they advertise only in Negro papers  --  the Amsterdam News , for instance . " " But why ? I do n't get it . " " Because they want your community to reach the tipping point . Then hundreds of houses will go on the market all at once , and the brokers will clean up in commissions . It 's a way of drumming up business on a huge scale . When they 're finished with Laurelton , some may move on to another town . " I felt angry but helpless . With Jay Steingold and other members of our group , I canvassed city and state agencies for advice . Most simply evaded the issue : " Yes , it 's reprehensible . but unless you can come up with concrete evidence . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we finally took our problem to William Guma , New York 's deputy secretary of state . He had an idea . The state law , he said , provided for something called a " cease and desist order . " If a homeowner does n't want to be annoyed by brokers urging him to sell , he signs a statement to that effect and files it with the New York secretary of state . Thereafter , any broker who solicits his business risks getting his license suspended . We sent out circulars asking interested homeowners to come to a meeting . Jay Steingold and I explained the cease and desist order . The atmosphere was tense , wary , occasionally hostile . These were people who had been harried for a long time . The peace of their community was disintegrating . Did they want to increase the tensions by declaring an open war with brokers ? Many felt they 'd rather not . A number of Negroes in the audience that night were also hostile . They feared that our efforts , rather than springing from a wish for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some involved . roundabout plan for keeping Negroes out of Laurelton . The meeting was a difficult one for us. but in the end we put our point across . About 21:0 people signed no-solicitation statements that night , and in the next few weeks several hundred more signed . In sum , it was not a bad showing , we thought  --  nearly 1,000 in a town of 5.000 homes . e won  --  and yet we did n't . As with VV our block meetings , we were victorious in a skirmish , but the real battle still went against us . Talking to homeowners , we found that many brokers were still bringing only Negroes into Laurelton ; and whites  --  even though prodded by fewer brokers ' calls and postcards  --  were still uneasy . I found myself knotted up with anger . Once I had been an observer ; now I was fully and inextricably involved . I would wake up at night and prowl about my house , or get dressed and pace the dark streets , or simply sit with a cup of coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sour from too much coffee , my disposition from too much brooding . I knew mere anger would do no good either for me or for I. Then , one nigh , I got an idea : If Laurelton 's citizens are n't happy with what some of the professional brokers are doing , I thought , why do n't we star ' our own brokerage ? AI first the idea seemed too foolish Io consider seriously . I mentioned it to nobody except my wife . Like me , she was intrigued but pessimistic . " I-low could amateurs compete with pros ? " she asked . Yet the idea nagged at me . Trying to assess its chances , I found myself baffled by a lack of knowledge about the real-estate business . I did n't know whether an amateur brokerage could succeed , because I did n't know what made any brokerage succeed . I was hampered still further by being a clergyman , untrained in practical matters . A fter worrying at the idea for weeks without reaching a satisfactory conclusion . I decided that the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something about the business . Rather than ask any of the brokers for information , which might have forewarned the blockbusters , I signed up for a night course at the Eastern School of Real Estate in Manhattan . Meanwhile . the Laurelton Fair Housing Council was forming plans for another attack on the offending brokers  --  this time a direct frontal attack . We picked one brokerage house . the Abco Realty Co .. as a test case , and sent in our own amateur investigators to obtain evidence of what we thought Abco was doing . One Sunday afternoon , for instance . Ahco received a visit from a young white couple . " We 're looking for a home in southeast Queens . " the wife said . " Some town on the Long Island Rail Road . We like English Tudors . What about Laurelton ? " " Oh no , " said the salesman . " I would n't advise it . Negroes are moving into Laureiton . " " But we have friends there . and they say the town has excellent values . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really your friends if they want you to live there . - Why , that area will be all-Negro in a matter of months . " When a Negro couple asked if Ahco had any listings in Laurelton , however , they were told . ' ' Oh yes . definitely . Laurelton is a very nice area . " The two couples wrote down these conversations and had them notarized . We repeated the procedure with about a dozen other couples . then showed the affidavits to Deputy Secretary Guma . His office promptly directed the State Division of Licensing Services to hold hearings on the affair . At these hearings , which were held in the division 's offices in New York City . our people told their stories . Abco denied ever having mentioned Laurelton 's racial composition unless specifically asked , but in the end the hearing officer concluded : " I find the respondent brokers . . . did engage in the practice of ... restricting sale of homes to Negro persons only .. as part of a scheme and plan to instill fear and anxiety among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommended that Abco 's license be suspended for six months . At last , we thought , we had scored a real triumph But once again we were wrong . Abco won a stay of the suspension order w lute it appealed to I1w courts , on I he ground that its right of free specel+ itad hem violated . If a broker bc1 - ? a neighlxithood may become a o ghetto , the brokers argued , is n't it his right to say so ? The courts decided in the brokers ' favor . Throughout this time I had continued going to real-estate school , nursing my secret idea . I 'd learned something about how a brokerage works , some of the basic causes of success and failure , and I 'd learned much about the law as it applies to the business . My idea still seemed workable . lfieelnt that oh ua rt tahtetat icnk o i ehn A had dcboci e failed , d , I ri n g my idea into the open . Our attempts to calm people down through block meetings had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced very little . Talking to brokers had been a total washout . Appealing to the law had n't helped . I felt that only one course remained to us : attacking the offending brokers economically by setting up a competing brokerage . Jay and the others were interested . We mulled over the idea for several weeks . Finally , one night in May . 1966 , I mentioned it to my synagogue 's board of directors . As I 'd expected , I ran into a wall of skepticism  --  and misgivings . Should a religious institution get involved in selling real estate , board members wondered . Was it proper for the synagogue to spend money on real-estate advertising ? I agreed that the idea was new and vulnerable , but I pointed out that it was in I Iii ' cause 01 brotherhood , Could Ihesynagogue le any cl Lerch simply stand by , uninvolved ? ' 11w board thought this over , then started asking piaci ical questions : Who would run this proposed brokerage ? I suggested that , at least in the beginning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The brokerage could be located in the Laurelton Jewish Center , and my secretary could handle some of the clerical work . Who would be the salesmen for this odd new brokerage ? I said I hoped to form a volunteer group of women . All right , said the board , politely trying not to laugh , but how could a few housewives led by a rabbi hope to compete with professionals ? Once again I admitted that the idea was new , but I pointed out that we would have one enormous advantage over the professionals : We would charge no fees . Using our service , a seller would not have a six-percent commission to pass on to the buyer . The board deliberated , hesitated , finally told me to go ahead . We set up shop in a large room right outside my study . on the second floor of the Laurelton Jewish Center . I rounded up four housewives as the initial cadre of saleswomen . They agreed to take turns manning the phone at the center ; and those not on phone duty would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any prospects who turned up . We depended mainly on word-of-mouth advertising and publicity in the local press to build our initial list of houses for sale ; people who had heard of us , and were moving away , agreed to let us show their homes . Some of these first sellers were delighted about it , some were merely curious . It did n't mailer to us . All we wanted was the chance io try . In August , 1966 , we Placed our le , 1 ad in the Sunday New hirk TinieN where c. - fiiiipa natively few Lauri:R ( 1n houses heel been advertised in recent years : " Look into the unique La Lind ton Home Finding Service . . . . All services voluntary . " Not much happened on the first Sunday . A few people phoned . Some were curious about our reference to " voluntary " services . We explained what we were doing , tried to assure suspicious callers that there was no catch , that we really were performing the service for nothing . A few couples came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . But we sold no houses . O n next Sunday business picked ? ... 1 up . Many couples . both Negroes and whites , came to look Laurelton over . The majority were obviously pleased . They enjoyed being shown around by volunteers ; it made the community seem friendly . Some appeared genuinely interested in the houses they saw . On the third Sunday , just as business was slowing down for the evening , volunteer Ray Perkal dashed into the office . " I 've sold a house ! " she cried triumphantly . " Our first ! " The buyers were young Mr. and Mrs. David Kranker , and they dispelled the doubts I still had about amateurs ' competing with pros . " I liked your approach , " Kranker , an attorney , told me later . " No high-pressure salesmanship , nobody hovering Over us . We were relaxed , Ana you leveled with us about everything . in going to like this community . " Il was I lie first of many sales , The Laurel ton Home Finding Service , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked . In its first 18 months of operation it sold /36 houses in Laurelion  --  more than any three local brokerages put together . Our staff of saleswomen rose from 4 to 38 . Two other synagogues and two Christian churches joined my own synagogue as cosponsors , and after that the service operated all weekend : Christians ran it on Saturdays , Jews on Sundays . About this time I began receiving visits from state inspectors  --  sent , ironically , by some of the same agencies to which we had appealed for help in our own early struggles . One of our opponents had complained to them that we were operating a brokerage without a license , an inspector told me . I suggested he look up Article 12A of the Real Property Law of New York State  --  something I 'd learned about in my courses . The law defines a broker as anyone who " for a fee , commission or other vaulahle consideration lists for sale , sells .. , or otherwise exchanges .... " This seemed to exclude us unequivocally. but the state inspectors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books willingly to the first man who came around and irritably to the second . When the third man walked in , I balked . " Listen , " I said . " I 'm a rabbi and a busy one . This business of going through books takes too much of my time . I 've done it twice , and that 's enough . I wo n't go through them again . " economic foundation to hold it steady . Latnelton has become so calm that the bliwk-busting campaign seems to have been abandoned . More brokers hall even het:Gadvertising in Thin/tics , apparent ly seeking Mine buyers . They seem to realize that . if they want to make a living in Laurelton , they 've got to do it on our terms  --  plus commissions , of course . 1 believe we 've taught them a lesson . I hope the lesson reaches the ears of the brokers who control the flow of home buyers into other towns . I 'm cony inced that any integration plan . al least in the suburbs , must start with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brokers have heard the Laurelton lesson . Not long ago , one of my emigregants told me that she and her husband had visited friends one evening in a Westchestersuburb . Thehostess worked part time selling homes . " Just last week . " she said . " I heard Laurelton mentioned at a Realtors ' meeting . " An official from the State Division of Licensing Services had addressed the meeting . " Brokers , " he said , " must accept their part of the responsibility for making integration and other social changes happen smoothly , If they don't. they may create a vacuum into which other groups will step . These other groups may grab not only the responsibility but the brokerage business as well . For example , there 's an odd amateur group led by a rabbi in a town out on Long Island .... "
