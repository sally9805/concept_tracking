txt WASHINGTON , June 22 ? Vice , ' resident Nixon at St. Louis , yeserday outlined the Republican par- ' y position on an issue inherent in he broad one that is expected to lominate the 1960 campaign . The ) road issue is the relative capacity ) f the two Presidential candidates o cope with theinflamed conditions n the world . The . component is how : o assure the national strength which will prove adequate to the ? impose . 1 The prospect at this point in the me-convention period is that the Democrats will propose to assure : his by vastly i expanding the role of the Federal Government in the economy . Their concept is that neither private enterprise nor local exercise of public power can be depended on for the acceleration in housing , highways , educationaf facilities , medical care and other social-economic advances which , together with a revised program of military defense , will develop the strength the United States must have to surmount its external and internal difficulties . The measure of this required strength , used by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent annual rise in " national product . " The Vice President yesterday expounded what he termed " an opposed political philosophy " to attain the same general objective , though he disputed the magic of the 5 per cent figure and jested at the cult of " growthmanship . " Under the policy he stated for the Republican party and himself as its Presidential candidate the Federal Government would limit its role  --  and hence Federal spending  --  to essential projects which private enterprise and local government " ca n't or wo n't " under , take . This , he said , would assure " sound growth based on sound money " and the continuation of a free society in the United States . The Desna= cratic policy , he contended , would lead directly to galloping inflation ( hence an unsound dollar and artificial " growth " ) and to a society in which the quantity and ' details of , production and consumption were regimented by the Federal Government . In this posture of weakness the United States , of course , could protect neither its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And . on this basis Nixon presented the the " op-1 posing philosophies " of e two parties as a ' component of the great issue before the voters of 1960.1 " What best promotes freedom , " he said , " best promotes- growth . What best promotes growth best promotes ' security . " The Merging Positions , The difficulty the Republicans will face , however , in drawing a precise line of demarcation between the two party philosophies was apparent in this paragraph of the Nixon speech : We must recognise the continuing need for investment in the public sector  --  in our public educational establishment , in our national transportation system , in the renewal of our run-down urban areas , in the development of our natural and human reSources . * * * Necessarily this ? " investment " must be of Federal funds drawn from general taxation sor by deficit financing . And the voters may well be unable to see a clear distinction between the Democratic - and Republican philosophies , only on major details of effecting the same . To demonstrate otherwise the Repub- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impose on Federal spending , in many of the Same areas selected by the Democrats , not only make their concept of the role of the central Government entirely different from that of the Democrats , but ' simultaneously will preserve the " sound dollar " and stimulate the " real " growth which the Democrats would destroy with ruinous inflation . The campaign debate on this corollary of the broad issue will be one of the most interesting aspects of the contest for the Presidency . But if the compromises on money bills in Congress offer a reliable guide , each convention platform and each Presidential candidate will draw nearer to the other on proposals for Federal spending . The Eisenhower Administration has moved progressively toward Federal participation in projects it began by interpreting as strictly the responsibility of private enterprise and local government . And the Democratic leadership in Congress has generally pursued a course of fiscal moderation . The , news from the aquarium suggests that what this country really needs is a good 5-cent national por-poise ?           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
