" They took us outside and lined us up against the wall . This was it . But to amuse themselves they deferred to tots - no more than seven or eight years old . ' What shall we do with them ? ' asked the adults . The children devised a different fate for each of us . ' Cut that one 's ear off and make him eat it , ' or , ' Cut his stomach open , ' or , ' Put his eyes out . ' Two rebels kept sharpening their spears all the time . The children yelled , ' Let 's get started . Kill the first one ! ' " <P> Such was the nightmare ordeal of 24 Europeans held prisoner by Communist-backed rebels in the Congolese town of Kindu , as recounted by a Belgian tin-mine employee . As things turned out , the children were disappointed , for at the last moment one of Moise Tshombe 's government bombers buzzed the town , and the rebels fled . But this and other stories coming to light last week added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Blackened Pavement . For all their claim of being " nationalists " -a label that in present-day Africa automatically draws a certain respect-the rebels are really just savage hoodlums on the loose . At Kindu airport , waiting to be flown out , a weeping Belgian woman told how rebel youths had speared and knifed her husband and two sons to death before her eyes in the family 's backyard . In the village of Kibombo , three elderly Belgian men were murdered with shotguns . <P> Actually , the rebels have killed more blacks than whites . To deal with Congolese " enemies of the revolution , " villagers would be assembled as a " people 's court . " A prisoner would be brought forward , and the crowd would be asked whether the accused was innocent or guilty . There was seldom any doubt about the verdict . In the square near Kindu 's main shopping district , hundreds of Congolese were burned to death with gasoline in front of the local Lumumba monument . Following Kindu 's recapture fortnight ago , government forces blew up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackened from the rebel burnings . <P> Captured documents showed that the rebel leaders themselves were having trouble with their chaotic troops . Commanders evidently had to field a steady stream of inspectors to keep the simbas ( or " lions , " as the rebel soldiers call themselves ) in line . The rebels , like most Congolese , could not kick their tribal superstitions . One communique from a rebel officer ended with an urgent P.S. : " I beg monsieur le colonel to make sure that all bridges in our territory be washed with medicine to protect against bombardment . " <P> Another guerrilla major reported that during an inspection trip he had been repeatedly arrested by leaders of the rebels ' own youth wing , the Jeunesse , who " would not respect my rank . " One loutish Jeunesse captain even threatened to have his fraternal superior executed for " troublemaking , " until the major paid him a 3,000-franc ( $20 ) bribe.
