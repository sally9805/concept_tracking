Along the Ginza , Tokyo 's garish main stem , a bar girl has to be able to handle all types-but even so . there 's a limit . It came for one Ginza doll last week when . as she put it . " I felt something playing footsie with me under the table . " Said she : " I figured it was the customer ; but the game went on after he excused himself . Then I looked down , and there was this huge rat trying to pry some meat out from under my foot . Sure . I knew we had rats , but when they get that familiar , I quit . " <P> Melons &; Minks . They have been getting more importunate every day . Some 2,000,000 strong , twice as numerous as the district 's daytime human population , the Ginza rat kingdom seems to have been caught up in a revolution of rodent expectations . No longer content with their network of underground rivers and sewers , armies of rats now prowl the Ginza every night after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with affluent tastes gorge themselves on such fancy groceries as melons , leather furniture and mink coats . One gormandizing rat pack even held up construction of a new building by chewing through a strong box and gobbling the blueprints ; dim Ginza bars have regular , unscheduled blackouts whenever rats gnaw through power lines , a never-failing taste treat . When a U.S. tourist was assured by the manager of a luxurious Ginza hotel that he could n't possibly have seen a rat " as big as a cat " in his room , the American bought a rat trap , showed up at the reservation desk the next day triumphantly lugging a - lb . Rattus norvegicus . <P> Last week Tokyo 's sanitation department joined forces with a passel of private exterminators in an all-out campaign to keep the Ginza for people . With military precision , anti-rat guerrillas fanned out through darkened department stores in stockinged feet , coordinating their offensive by means of walkie-talkies . " This is C Team calling B Team . " whispered one communications man to the unit on the floor below him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor scurrying down . Close door immediately . Over . " <P> Meatballs &; Mikes . For weapons , the rat hunters mostly used a supply of 300,000 poisoned meatballs-about one for every six or eight rats believed to be in the Ginza . Exterminators bugged ratholes with tiny microphones so as to detect enemy strongholds . They also planted extra-strong traps that are normally used to trap mink , since Ginza rats are a special samurai breed that can usually chew through a conventional trap . The hunters had no illusions about their foe . " The Ginza rats are terribly clever , " said one old rodent fighter . " You ca n't just leave a meatball by a rathole and expect them to eat it . That 's much too obvious . What you must do is put the meatballs in , say , a cardboard box with a little hole in it . Then the rat will eat it thinking it 's something you do n't want him to have . " <P> In three days , the exterminators had killed about 6,500 rats outright , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took effect . But each female rat can theoretically produce about 70 offspring every year . Concluded one sanitation official : " What we really need is the Pied Piper of Hamelin . "
