txt Movie Mailbag EDWIN 0 . KENNEDYBRIGITTA D. MASELLIGRAHAM R. HODGES , FAUBION BOWERSROBERT J.E .... Movie Mailbag Where Will the Violence End ? Patrick Wolfe in " Beach Red " Too gory for responsible 17-year olds ? To THE EDITOR : I write to express my hearty agreement with Bosley Crowther when he deplores the increasing presentation of violence in the movies  --  and therefore on television , where such movies are commonly shown . Some time ago I saw a film on TV which showed a gang of teen-aged toughs beating and kicking an old man to death . There is absolutely no question in my mind , despite the rationalization of the psychiatrists , that to see this kind of action . again and again tends to harden human sensibilities and to persuade the viewers that brutality is a commonplace of life . . If we saw these scenes on the street day after day , we could not avoid losing something of our sense of shock and outrage  --  just as the people of India become used to the idea of starvation by seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The same effect , even though in lesser degree , is produced by witnessing such scenes in " living color . " Our President has appointed a commission to study the causes of the violence , bloodshed and brutality that have recently cast a shadow over our cities and our country . I suggest that this commission might well begin its work by asking whether part of the cause may not lie in the movies and TV programs which , by constant repetition , suggest that to shoot or kick a man to death is part of the American way of life . Rather than consulting the psychiatrists , I suggest that we go back to lines by Alexander Pope who , long before the days of movies , recognized that the constant witnessing of vice and crime lowers our resistance and makes it far easier to return to sub-jungle ways : Vice is a monster of so frightful mien , As to be hated needs but to be seen ; Yet seen too oft , familiar with her face , We first endure , then pity , then embrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church Orange , N. J. SLEUTHING REQUIRED To THE EDrroR : Mr. Crowther 's article stating his feeling of alarm at the current display of violence in the movies made me cheer aloud . With two teen-agers in the house , giving permission to see a movie requires considerable sleuthing and reading of reviews , and is a frustrating experience , since so few are fit to be seen . Our friends , also , in a recent discussion , deplored the very small number of films which could be considered entertainment in any sense of the word , much less carry any moral or intellectual value . Such an article by Mr. Crowther , I am sure , carries a good deal of weight . BRIGITTA D. MASELLI Morristown , N. J. TERRIBLE RUT To THE EDITOR : Many thanks for Mr. Crowther 's column on " Another Smash at Violence . " Perhaps through this ridiculous war and the increasing riots the American public will get its fill of violence , and turn to more sensible ways of looking at life . However , I am pessimistic at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solving problems with a gun and I do n't know how long . it will take to get out of this terrible rut . GRAHAM R. HODGES , Minister , Emmanuel Congregational Church , Watertown , N. Y. UNWELCOME CENSORSHIP To THE EDITOR ; My 15-year-old son ( home from summer school ) and I went to see " Beach Red . " I was involved with the Tarawa battle personally , and particularly wanted to share that historical experience with him . Although neither in the newspaper advertisement , nor on a placard at the box office , was there any announcement that admission was restricted to 18-year-olds or over , we were turned away . Two 17-yearolds behind , us were also denied admittance to the theater even though they said they were 18 . When asked to show their draft cards to prove their age , one of them replied , with wide-eyed mockinnocence , " I burned it . " As we left , disappointed , my son said , " You have to be already draftable to know what you 're getting into . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I seriously question the legality and/or moral right of the Trans-Lux Theaters to exercise censorship of any kind as to what a serious parent may take an ? intelligent and experienced son to see , and to cause enormous inconvenience by not stating such a policy publicly . At least the nice theater that ran " The King of Hearts " informed every patron that it was not showing " A King 's Story " . . . a confusion many sentimentalists made . As for " Beach Red , " a word of warning that it is gory and bloody should be enough to keep parents and 17-yearolds responsible . FAUBION BOWERS New York City " ART FOR ART 'S SAKE " TO THE EDITOR : Kudos for " The Name of the Game is Excitement " by John M. Culkin , S.J. The modern film ( which includes the works of Fellini , Antonioni , Bergman , Kurosawa , Truffaut , Resnais , et al. ) is an intensely personal creation in two senses . First , the modern filmmaker is translating human experience directly in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his film . Second , an ? integral part of the chemical reaction that ' is a film is the human element , the audience . The incisive knowledge of the . , , human personality and the ' technical craftsmanship evident in films such as Fellini 's " Juliet of the Spirits " and Antonioni 's " Blow-Up " - the effective presentation of totally human characters , the excellence of the photography , the inventive use of vibrant color and form in scenic design , in short , the composite quality of the // product  --  will not allow the " Conscientious viewer to remain a passive spectator ; he .. is thrown , shot , or convulsed , i , into the celluloid medium as a responding person . The study of the film is an essential part of contemporary education ; it is as , .. legitimate a field of study as the novel or the play or the - 'poem . The film is not art for art 's sake but art for our sake . ROBERT J. E. Hosmat . JR . 47 .1 , Holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NO INSTANT PH.D 'S . To THE EDITOR : The danger of many mod. ? ern films placating the tastes of the Now Generation is that they are mainly made for emotion rather than intellect , for body rather than spirit , for action rather than art . The theory of the Western is that motion or movement of itself is drama . Maeterlinck saw drama in another light , as Allardyce Nicoll has observed in his excellent study , " World drama " : " I have come to think that the motionless old man is living in reality a deeper , more human and more general life than the lover who strangles his mistress , the captain who wins a victory or the ' husband who avenges his honor . " The  --  important point is that the Now Generation will be painfully , if not psychically , scarred when they face the serious realities of life . There is no Now Ma . Nor an instant Ph.D . Nor , for Gurney and Foyt , was Le Mans a quickie in Tompkins Park . The National Open is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the result of thousands of hours of preparation . Yes , the medium has changed and any teacher would be foolish to ignore films . But because we live in an age when exposing nerve ends Is in fashion , we are naturally fascinated , as with looking at an operation . One ca n't help but look at the tearing of flesh . Yet , if intellect is not stressed , electricity takes us back not forward . One of the most terrible dangers of the movies is that they make things appear Now and the young people think they can enjoy Now and forever also . Nothing 's easy in life and it gets harder . We would keep our mental homes less crowded if we prepared today 's youth for this eternal reality . TERENCE MCGUIRE English Department , Wheeling College ( Jesuit ) Wheeling , W.
