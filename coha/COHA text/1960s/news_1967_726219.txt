txt The rising losses suffered by Communist forces in South Vietnam are seriously challenging the military strategy of the leaders in Hanoi . Faced with the devastating artillery , air-power , and mobility of the Americans and other Allied troops in Vietnam , the Communists rely mainly on elusiveness and surprise for their successes . The Communists have also developed the " hugging the belt " tactic by which they move in so close to United States lines that artillery and air can not be used . At least , that is the theory . But as demonstrated in Tuesday 's savage battle with the United States Fourth Division , the tactic has fatal flaws . Even though the Communists attacked only when they were almost atop United States lines , the Americans managed to call in artillery within 35 meters of their own positions to beat back the attack . The American commanders , whose men were outnumbered 5 to 1 , frankly credit their air and artillery support for saving the day . Support credited Such Allied victories probably explain why the Communists themselves have in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The latest appeared Wednesday when marines of the Third Division reported they had been shelled by light or medium artillery , Soviet 140 mm. rockets which were used earlier in successful attacks against the vital Da Nang Air Base . Tuesday it was reported that Chinese 102 mm. rockets were used against marine positions in Quang Tri Province in the north . And on Wednesday , Army weapons specialists told this correspondent that a third type of rocket  --  more powerful and with greater range than any previously reported ? was also used against the Marines .

Their range , far greater than the 60 and 82 mm. mortars the Communists have used , could force the allies to use more broadranging patrols to defend their perimeters . Besides their rockets and artillery , the Communists are also making wider use of the heavy , 120 mm. mortar .

By contrast , the largest artillery piece the Communists previously had was the 82 mm. mortar . It fires only an 8.6-pound shell with a range of under two miles . Rifles improved The average Communist foot soldier also becomes better equipped with every passing month . In the big Junction City battle , United States commanders report the Communists have neat black uniforms with khaki trousers and pith helmets . More important , most wielded new-model Chinese assault rifles with stainless steel bayonets and corrosion-resistant aluminum parts . The new rifles are a far cry from the poor hand-me-downs left over from the war against the French or even the homemade weapons the Viet Cong had been using . These newer tines , a copy of a Russian version , carry a 30-round clip and can be fired on full automatic . American rifles ( the M-16 used by the Army and the M-14 used by the Marines ) carry only a 20-round clip . Edge conceded In a rapid-fire contest , experts concede that the Chinese rifles probably could out- fire the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be equipped with 30-round clips to remove this disadvantage . In addition , the Chinese rifles certainly must be ranked far above the old slow-firing IvI-1 's which are still being used by Korean and South Vietnamese troops here . The sharp contrast between their weapons and the Communists ' has brought recent protests from both Korean and South Vietnamese sources . Officials now report that Korean and Vietnamese soon will be given some advanced M-16 's for familiarization by troops . And United States Marines will soon begin trading in their M-14 's for the better M-16's.
