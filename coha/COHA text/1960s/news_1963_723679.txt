txt On Christmas Eve , the snows lay deep and still , A tiny sparrow , numbed by bitter cold , Flew toward the shrine , upon a lofty hill , And saw the Babe , enwrapped in shining gold . This is the Christ Child , sang his trembling heart ; - Where is a gift for this sweet , holy child ? He gave a scarlet berry , as his part ' , The Babe stirred , in his Mother 's arms . . . and smiled ! HELEN T. BRowx BY PHILIP MAXWELL In many respects the annual Good Fellow campaign of Chicago Tribune Charities is almost a legend , a legend in the snows of cold Decembers since 1909 when the first Mr. Good Fellow , the late Edward Churchill Fitch. asked this newspaper 's readers to be Good Fellows . Since that first story in TIES CHICAGO TRIBUNE , thousands of persons have purchased toys and other gifts for dependent children so that boys and girls bereft of parents might have a happy Christmas . Legend Comes to Life And the legend came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 12,500 children who received gifts . The youths are in the care of 20 charitable institutions in and about Chi cago . Some received the gifts with tears in their eyes , others shouted for joy . The Good Fellows are given the name of a child and a list of three things the child wishes . The Good Fellow tries to find the presents mentioned . For instance , we have reason to believe that Martin , 10 , got his white chalk , and Marion , 8 , a book . Both children are in the care of the Illinois Children 's Home and Aid Society . Joan , 12 , suggested the Bible , and Evelyn , 10 , a hair ribbon . These children live in the Angel Guardian Orphanage . TV Sparks Desires Television plays a dominant role in the kind of gifts the children desire . Edward , 8 , of the Family Court of Cook county , told his supervisor that he wanted a constructive thinking set , while George , 11 , of the Illinois Lutheran Welfare association , wanted a Taj @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even toy mice . But the request that impressed thri Good Fellow workers most , said Dale Osborn , manager of the Good Fellow bureau , was that of Thomas , age 12 , whose code number in the file is P 6017 . He asked for a gift for his mother .
