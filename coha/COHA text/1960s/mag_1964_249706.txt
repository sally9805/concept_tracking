The chant echoed like a thundering pulse beat : " Cuatro ms ! Cuatro ms ! - Four more ! Four more ! " On the banner-draped platform in Mayagez one day last week , the top leaders of Puerto Rico 's Popular Democratic Party watched tensely as the bearlike man at the microphone motioned for quiet . Then came the news : " I want to return to what created the Popular Democratic Party 25 years ago , to what liberated the energy that constructed the Puerto Rico of today . I want to return to the school , to the farmyard , to the hearts of the people so that all together we can forge the Puerto Rico of the next 25 years . Permit me to leave office to serve the democracy of Puerto Rico . " <P> Luis Muoz Marin , 66 , Governor of Puerto Rico , architect of the island 's life-giving Operation Bootstrap and its unique commonwealth status , was stepping aside after four terms ( 16 years ) in office . He would not , he insisted , be his party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would accept nomination for the senate , whence he came , but nothing more . " You must have confidence in yourselves , " he pleaded . " You have honored me as a leader and as a teacher , and now the teacher says : ' It is time to return to the class . ' " No sooner had Muoz finished than the chants erupted again-louder and fiercer . He grabbed the microphone . " You can not make me violate my own conscience ! " he roared above the din-and that was that . <P> Essence &; Energy . To Puerto Ricans , the Muoz announcement meant much more than the leave-taking of an able administrator and brilliant politician . For more than a generation Muoz has been the island 's one and only leader-vigorous , charismatic , the essence and energy of an economic and social revolution that has touched the lives of every Puerto Rican . <P> The son of a venerated Puerto Rican statesman , Muoz studied law at Washington 's Georgetown University , returned to Puerto Rico in 1926 , and has been fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Puerto Rico was little more than a sugar barony controlled by a few large U.S. companies ; per capita income was a pitiable $120 a year . In 1938 , Muoz formed his Popular Democratic Party , four years later as senate president organized Operation Bootstrap , and was soon luring mainland industry to Puerto Rico . With generous tax incentives and cheap , plentiful labor , company after company found it profitable to set up plants until today the island 's gross national product is growing 11% a year , wages average $1.11 an hour , new investment is running $1,000,000 a day , and per capita income is up to $740-second highest in Latin America , surpassed only by oil-rich Venezuela . <P> Best of Both Worlds . Some Latin Americans sneer at the success , accuse Muoz of running a sugar-coated Yanqui labor colony , swapping independence for U.S. dollars . Puerto Ricans know better . They are fiercely proud of their " Spanishness " and regard their unique commonwealth status in " free association " with the U.S. as the best of both worlds . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between a territory and a full-fledged state . The U.S. protects the island , and Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens-though they pay no federal taxes .
