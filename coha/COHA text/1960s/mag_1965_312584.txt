Why Is Gold So Important ? <P> <P> Partly because it has been the universal symbol of wealth since before the Lydians invented money . More practically , gold is limited in supply and therefore fairly stable ; it is valuable even in small amounts , and thus eminently portable . Unlike paper currencies , it is immune to inflation , loss of value and most other disasters . It is a keystone of the international monetary system , more highly prized than most paper currencies . <P> <P> What Is the International Monetary System ? <P> <P> It is a series of treaties and gentlemen 's agreements among the world 's nations about how they will finance their trade with one another . Since there is no truly global paper money , most trade is paid for in gold or in the two internationally accepted " reserve " currencies whose value is backed by gold : dollars and pounds. * This system has led to the creation of such organizations as the International Monetary Fund , which lends reserve currencies to nations with a trade deficit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital . <P> How Has the System Worked ? <P> Fairly well , considering the task . It was set up in 1944 at Bretton Woods , N.H. , by a conference of finance ministers and economists from the allied powers . They aimed to prevent a repetition of the disasters of the 1930s , when there was a chain reaction of devaluation , deflation and depression . The system has not only succeeded in that goal , but has stimulated trade and economic growth . Lately , it has shown signs of age and inadequacy , which have served to place the two reserve currencies under a strain . <P> <P> Why Are the Dollar and the Pound Reserve Currencies ? <P> <P> Says a U.S. Treasury official : " We did n't plan it that way-it just happened . " The strength of a country 's currency depends upon its political , military and economic might . After the war , Europe 's money was unstable and inconvertible-but the dollar could buy anything , anywhere . Britain 's pound also weakened , but continued to be important because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What Does the U.S. Get Out of Being a Reserve Currency Country ? <P> <P> Power , prestige-and headaches . Its tourists and businessmen can convert their money around the world at favorable exchange rates , since nearly everybody wants dollars because of their stability and superior buying power . Many foreigners convert their own moneys into more secure dollars , then deposit the dollars in U.S. banks , where U.S. bankers invest them at a profit . On the other hand , the foreigners have the legal right at any time to cash in their dollar holdings for U.S. gold-and the U.S. thus has to maintain a multi-billion-dollar stock of gold , which earns no interest . <P> Why Is the U.S. Losing Gold ? <P> Because it puts so many dollars into foreign hands in the form of foreign aid , military aid , tourist spending , investment and loans . Last year all these added up to almost $10 billion . Result : despite its healthy $7.2 billion surplus in foreign trade , the U.S. ran a foreign-payments deficit of about $2.65 billion or more . <P> <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P>
