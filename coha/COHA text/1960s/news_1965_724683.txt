txt Newspaper publishers and the printers ' union here jointly asked a mediator yesterday to help resolve the remaining major issues blocking a settlement of their bargaining dispute . Two representatives from each side in the negotiations met privately in the afternoon With Theodore W. Kheel , lawyer , labor mediator , and an adviser to Mayor Wagner . The meeting was at Mr. Kheel 's office , 280 Park Avenue . John J. Gaherin , president of the Publishers ' Association of New York City , and Matt Meyer , chairman of the association 's board of directors , attended the session with Bertram A. Powers , president of the New , York Typographical Local No. 6 , and David Crockett , the local 's vice president . Mr. Gaherin said when the // unannounced meeting ended at 5 P.M. that the negotiators had " made a considerable amount of progress . " The talks with Mr. Kheel were resumed last evening at the offices of the publishers ' association at 220 East 42d Street . Mr. Powers , when he appeared for the night session , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesser issues " during the afternoon meeting . The mediation meeting came when the negotiations appeared to be heading for a new crisis involving the seven publishers in the association and the New York Photo-engravers ' Union No. 1 . Frank A. , president of the union , demanded that the publishers clarify part of a letter sent by the association Thursday night to the four unions that had agreed to terms for a new two-year contract , which included a $10.50-a-week ' economic package increase . In the letter the publishers said that they had agreed to " consider " the percentage approach . The letter did not mention the photoengravers or their agreement to postpone a strike . Wednesday Agreement The photoengravers said that the basis for an agreement reached early Wednesday at City Hall was that the publishers would negotiate a settlement with them based on a percentage wage increase . The engravers , as the highestpaid of the newspaper craft unions , have voiced concern that their wage advantage over the other unions was diminishing because of the publishers ' practice of granting the same increases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the engravers at the association 's offices were at a standstill most of the day while the dispute was discussed . At one point , Mr. threatened to invoke a warning that his union would go on strike in 24 hours . Arguments became so heated among the union committee 's members that Mr. sent them back to the union headquarters at 853 Broadway . Dispute Resolved The dispute over the publishers ' letter was resolved when Mr. Gaherin met for 20 minutes with Mr. and Frederick Van Cott , the union 's vice president . Mr. Gaherin announced afterward : " We 've agreed to continue negotiating with the photoen- ' gravers . While no offer above $10.50 has been made , it is understood that when we reach the end of the road it will be above the $10.50 level and will be expressed percentage-wise if the union so desires . " Mr. said the question was settled " to our satisfaction " by Mr. Gaherin 's statement . A negotiation session with the photoengravers started at 8 P.M. with John Wilson , a Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' union had also asked for a clarification of the letter , because of what Mr. Powers termed the publishers ' " semantics . " In response to the printers , Mr. Gaherin made this statement : " We have made no offer ' above $10.50 , but we have agreed that the settlement will be an amount above $10.50 when it is finally reached . Unions Disagree " At no time did Local 6 make as a condition of an agreement the requirement of a percentage wage settlement . It was and is negotiating solely for its own unit . " Mr. Gaherin said that in the final financial settlement with the 10 unions that represent newspaper employes , " the overall level will be equal . " As a consequence of the agreement obtained by the printers and the photoengravers for a wage settlement above the $10.50 ceiling that had been previously set , a behind-the ' scenes disagreement between the newspaper unions came into the open . The independent Newspaper and Mail Deliverers Union of New York and Vicinity , through its lawyer , Asher W. Schwartz , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group that had represented nine unions . The deliverers had accepted ' the $10.50 settlement . The union said it was withdrawing from the council " because of a failure to reach joint understandings and decisions on policy . " Murphy Says He 'll Resign Thomas J. Murphy , executive vice president of the Newspaper Giuld of New York , said he intended " personally to resign " from the council and would ask his union to withdraw . The Guild has indicated it would accept the same terms . Mr. Murphy said : " The reason is that I personally do not see eye-to-eye with some of the members of the council . In recent events there have been too many differences of opinion . " At least two other unions are considering withdrawal from the council , Mr. Murphy said . The New York Printing Pressmen 's Union No. 2 withdrew last year . Thomas M. Laura , president of the New York Mailers Union No. 6 and of the council , said last night that " we still have a Newspaper Trade Union Council and it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization are the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Union No. 3 , the International Association of Machinists , Eureka Lodge No. 434 , Paper Handlers and Straighteners Union No. 1 , and New York Stereotypers Union No. 1 . The newspapers have attempted to coordinate their bargaining programs since 1950 . A split among the unions ' leaders became apparent during the 114-day strike of 1962-63 , when the coordinating group was called the Officers for Newspaper Union Unity , or more commonly , the Unity Committee . Six of the committee 's members opposed a settlement worked out with the publishers in November , 1962 , by the Newspaper Guild . This dispute set the stage for the long strike that winter , when the printer 's union said it would ignore any formula worked out by the Guild and seek its own terms . Tarshis Pays Visit Yesterday 's mediation meeting was set up by a telephone call from Mr. Gaherin and Mr. Powers to Mr. Kheel at noon . They had met for an hour in the morning and had conferred with Morris Tarshis , the city 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices to investigate the progress of negotiations . After a break for lunch , the four negotiators slipped quietly away to Mr. Kheel 's office . There are several issues still faced by the printers and publishers , including wages and the sharings of savings derived from the use of perforated tape to operate Linotype machines for setting stock exchange tables . As part of the settlement of the strike two years ago , the newspapers won the right to use the tape made outside their offices and to share any savings with the union . A formula for sharing the savings has not been agreed upon . Mr. Kheel played an important part in settling the strike and in postponing a strike early Wednesday morning . Mayor Wagner said yesterday he had canceled a trip to speak at Vanderbilt University last night in order to remain available in the newspaper talks . " I committed myself to the negotiators to be available in case of an impasse , " the Mayor said .                  @ @ @
