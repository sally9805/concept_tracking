An evening With Yves Montand- <P> French Troubadour Yves Montand has a bedroom voice in a truck driver 's body . His throaty baritone undresses every noun , verb and parenthetical clause that comes slithering past his lips . With hips cocked , eyes squinted against some inner sunburst of passion , and hands expressively molding the air , Montand is one of the most potent love potions ever poured across the footlights . But Montand has more than sex appeal buttoned under his dark brown open-necked shirt . He is a one-man theater of the performing arts , an expert mimic , a clown , a barometric actor who can shift moods , weather-quick , without shattering them . <P> His chansons are about ordinary people who come to sad ends rather than bad ends . In Un Carbon Dansait , a slum-bred youngster dreams of being another Fred Astaire ; Montand manages a brilliant satiric evocation of second-rate Astaire-the outflung white-gloved hands ( without the gloves ) , the staccato rhythms tapped out on a walking stick like a hollow third leg , and the agitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number casts Montand as a feverish symphony conductor who snaps his baton , his Beethoven concert and his career in two to waltz off with a girl who cares only for waltzes . In sentimental Parisian songs , Montand runs the risk of sounding like a younger Chevalier , but winds through his own Paris as naturally as the Seine . <P> Since his 1959 Manhattan visit , Montand has annexed , but not really acquired , some English . His two English numbers are close to ho-hum . But for the rest of the evening , this Gallic son of Aphrodite is mmmmm-nnnnnn !
