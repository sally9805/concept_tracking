Any roster of the great Russian novelists of this century must include Mi khail Sholokhov , Boris Pasternak and Alexander Solzhenitsyn . Sholokhov ( The Quiet Don ) and Pasternak ( Doc tor Zhivago ) were both Nobel prize winners . Solzhenitsyn 's recently published The First Circle and Cancer Ward firmly established him as the greatest living writer of Russian prose today ( TIME Cover , Sept. 27 ) . Last week , in di verse manners and locales , important new works by all three men simultaneously appeared . <P> &gt;Sholokhov 's They Fought for Their Country , his first major novel since The Quiet Don came out 40 years ago , began to be excerpted in Pravda . That was slightly surprising , since the novel had been rumored to be banned be cause of its critical portrayal of Joseph Stalin . In fact , Sholokhov does seem to go somewhat beyond what the Brezhnev regime has until now considered politic in Soviet literature-but not very far . He mentions the existence of Stalinist concentration camps , but in considerable understatement notes that " thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures to be in the millions . Stalin would doubtless be astonished to read that many of his crimes were committed because he had been " misinformed , misled and mystified " by his secret police chiefs . <P> &gt; Pasternak 's The Blind Beauty , a play , was published in an Italian magazine , Il Dramma , - the first of a series of three plays that Pasternak had intended as his " testament . " Il Dramma Editor Giancarlo Vigorelli , in his introduction to the play , writes that he believes Pasternak 's purpose was nothing less than " a religious , popular , social interpretation of the history of Russia , this ' Blind Beauty . ' " Pasternak completed The Blind Beauty before his death nine years ago and left notes for the second play , but never got around to outlining the final drama , so far as is known . Blind Beauty itself was , in fact , believed lost , the only copies having been seized by the secret police . How a copy survived and reached the West is unknown . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bristles with bandits and bursts of gunfire . The heroine is a serf girl , blinded as the result of a violent quarrel between master and slave . She seems to be meant to symbolize Russia , forever the victim of the conflict between barbarism and the simple , instinctive virtue that exists in its soul . <P> &gt; Solzhenitsyn 's new novel , Arkhipelag Gulag , reached the West , smuggled out in manuscript form without the author 's knowledge or consent , and was being eagerly bid for by Western publishers . Banned by the Kremlin , as were the author 's two previous novels , the work has long been circulating in Russia by hand-copied samizdat , the underground press . The book is said to form the last part of a trilogy with The First Circle and Cancer Ward . In it , Solzhenitsyn takes Gleb Nerzhin , Circle 's hero , from the relative comfort of the prison scientific community to the most terrible of Stalin 's concentration camps . The novel 's virtually untranslatable Russian title , Arkhipelag Gulag , suggests that all of Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of concentration camps . Gulag is an acronym of the dread Main Labor Camp Administration .
