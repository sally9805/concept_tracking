Last November Venezuela uncovered a three-ton Cuban arms cache on its northern shore , and took its evidence to the Organization of American States , charging Fidel Castro with " aggression . " Last week , after seven long months of diplomatic maneuver , the OAS finally bowed to Venezuelan pressure and set July 21 as the date for a full-dress foreign-ministers meeting on Castroite subversion . Said Venezuela 's OAS Ambassador Enrique Tejera Paris : " If the OAS can not move now , we will become a laughingstock . " <P> The OAS could go so far as to impose military sanctions against Castro , specifically a blockade to prevent further gunrunning . But the most that can be hoped for is a two-thirds OAS vote for an economic embargo to cut off Castro 's remaining trade ( $9,000,000 annually ) with Latin American nations . The OAS may also recommend that Mexico , Chile , Bolivia and Uruguay complete Castro 's diplomatic isolation by breaking their ties with Havana . When the final vote comes up , Mexico and Chile will probably abstain , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Awhile the OAS was meeting in Washington , new evidence was building up against Castro . Last month officials in Surinam , The Netherlands ' self-governing colony on South America 's northeast coast , reported that Castro gunrunners in high-speed launches are smuggling large amounts of arms down the Courantyne River for delivery to Communist terrorists in neighboring British Guiana . The Dutch army has already sent 1,000 soldiers , plus two helicopters , to reinforce the border-river patrols , and a navy frigate has just steamed in with more much-needed help . <P> More specific was the first real evidence of Castro guerrillas in Argentina . Last March Argentine national police captured six Castroites in a mountainous area of Salta province , near the Bolivian border . Over the next three months , the police captured 27 more and identified several marauding bands . The captured men , some of whom had Castro-style beards , wore olive-drab uniforms , black-and-red armbands , and called themselves the " People 's Guerrilla Army . " As in Venezuela 's F.A.L.N. terrorist group , the men were between 25 and 35 ; at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nicknamed " El Cubano . " <P> The guerrillas were armed wih submachine guns , pistols , grenades and explosives . Two of the guns were Belgian Fabrique Nationale automatic rifles that bore the Cuban military crest and were traced to a 1959 shipment to Castro . There were also five antitank projectiles of Russian make .
