During a party at Arlington House , London residence of British Press Lord Beaverbrook , the conversation turned to a British actress who was publicly planning a holiday abroad with her ex-husband . The Beaver thought that the public might consider the trip in bad taste , but one of his guests demurred . " I do n't think so , " said Arthur Christiansen , who had just retired after 24 years as editor of Beaverbrook 's biggest newspaper , the London Daily Express ( circ. 4,269,704 ) . " Indiscretions merely attract the public in a greater degree to the box office . " Delighted , the Beaver turned to another guest : " There you have the whole of the Daily Express in one sentence . " <P> In his autobiography , Headlines All My Life , Arthur Christiansen , 56 , embellishes his 1957 summary of the Daily Express with some 100,000 words . The result confirms the Beaver 's judgment : with his casual remark to Beaverbrook . Retiring Editor Christiansen spelled out his own philosophy of journalism and the whole story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Wallasey , a grimy industrial city near Liverpool , Arthur Christiansen got to Fleet Street at 20 as London editor of the Liverpool Evening Express , a brash young man whose hair broke over a " rather high brow in embarrassing , almost girlish waves . " At 29 , he became editor of the Daily Express , second-largest daily in the Western world ( after the London Daily Herald ) . In jig time , Christiansen had the Express in front , although it was later overtaken by the London Daily Mirror . Before a heart attack forced him into retirement , Express circulation doubled . <P> As editor , Christiansen never bothered to question the Beaver 's truculent jingoism-up the British Empire , down the League of Nations , the United Nations and most things American-that set Express policy : " I was a journalist , not a political animal , " he says by way of explanation . " My approach to newspapers , " Christiansen told a British television audience last year , " was based on the idea that when you looked at the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you looked at the middle page you said : ' Holy Smoke , ' and by the time you got to the back page-well , I 'd have to utter a profanity to show how exciting it was . " <P> " News , News , News . " As edited by Christiansen , the news was not only exciting , it was sometimes unreal . When an Express reporter described a condemned murderer as " a dreamer with the eyes of a poet , " Christiansen sent another man out to collect a verse from the killer . The paper soon had its poem . " There was no explanation as to how it had fallen into our hands , " said Christiansen in his book . " Nor did I dare inquire . " Nor was he surprised to learn later that the poem had been ghosted by a Fleet Street colleague . Throughout the war , the Express maintained a deliberately manic mood : THE FLEET 'S HERE-it screamed in a banner headline in 1940 , when a solitary British destroyer steamed up the Thames . <P> After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During his years at the top , the Express bulletin board was splattered with exhortations to the staff to keep the COMMON TOUCH . Samples : <P> There are too many stories about things and not enough about people .
