txt In the peak spring sales season , in the biggest car sales year , this motor capital is suddenly being filled with talk that the auto boom is slowing  --  from unbelievable to merely phenomenal . Car sales and production still are setting records week after week . But the sales increases over the corresponding periods of 1964 have narrowed month by month : The sales increase over 1964 was 26e ; in January , 20e , ; - , in February , 16 ' in March . and 6e , ; , in April . Though May sales so far are also up from 1964. and even top the April pace a bit , they are n't showing the year-to-year gains of the first quarter . With second-quarter volume thus rising less from the early months of the year than usual , auto economists calculate that on a seasonally adjusted basis the annual rate of car sales is down a bit , to about 8.9 million now , from a 9.8 million-a-year rate in the first quarter . This drop largely reflects the fading of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Motors Corp . and Ford Motor Co .. which cost production of 500.000 cars . Several hundred thousand cars that normally would have been bought late last year probably were delivered in the 1965 first quarter , pushing sales then to an annual rate that could n't be sustained . Second Half , 1966 Forecasts But the majority opinion among auto market analysts is that the annual sales rate in this year 's second half will slow a bit more , dropping perhaps under the 9.2 million rate expected for the whole first half . Auto sales normally begin declining in June . and stay down until the introduction of new models in the fall , but most  --  not all  --  company market analysts expect the drop in this year 's second half to be a bit greater than could be expected because of this seasonal factor alone . One reason : The model changeover may not bring the stimulus to this year 's sales that the introduction of 1965 models brought to 1964 volume , as the 1966 cars will be mostly " face lifts " of those popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars . Looking further ahead , most auto analysts now see 1966 sales " close to 9 million , " or perhaps a few hundred thousand lower than the total now expected for all 1965 . Partly responsible for the expected decline are increases in Social Security taxes that will begin pulling an extra $5 billion annually out of consumers ' pockets next Jan. 1 . Auto economists expect this to more than offset the increases in consumer purchasing power that will result from the excise tax cuts President Johnson bas proposed . The President 's proposals include reductions in the excise tax on autos , retroactive to midMay . But auto men have figured on such a tax cut for months , and have considered it in preparing their sales forecasts ; enactment of the cut wo n't change those forecasts now . No Unanimity There are several qualifications to these new expectations . One is that they are far from unanimous . Predictions of the annual sales rate in this year 's second half range from 8.5 million to 9.2 million  --  a pace that would match the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 8.5 million 0 , a figure that would mark a fair-sized drop from the expected 1965 total  --  to a new record of 9.5 million . There are indications , too , that some auto economists are talking more cautiously , in preparing their sales estimates , than they actually feel , preferring to err , if err they must , on the side of caution . " Personally , I feel sales next year will be well over 9 million , and better than this year , " says one . " But that 's my personal opinion ; as a prudent businessman I say 8.5 million to 9 million so I do n't get my finger caught in the wringer . You do n't get too much credit around here for being right and high , but we catch hell if we 're wrong the same way ; it 's a lot easier to raise production than to lower it . " But the biggest qualification is that any talk of a " drop " in the auto sales pace must be strictly relative . The most " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered wildly optimistic only six months ago . Though the annual rate of auto sales may be down now from the unsustainable pace hit briefly in the 1965 first quarter , it remains startlingly high by any other standards . General Motors Corp . currently has 300,000 customer orders for cars on its books , up MC : , from a year ago . Assembly plants are expect . ed to continue rolling out 200,000 cars a week through May , June and July . pushing output for the 1965 model year to about 8.8 million  --  nearly a million more than the 7,890,000 made in the sensational 1964 model run . Five Straight Boom Years ? Current majority forecasts are for actual deliveries of about 4.8 million ears in this year 's first half , and 4.2 million to 4.3 million - in the second half . That would add up to sales of 9 million to 9.1 million cars ( including about 500,000 imports ) for 1965 ? by far the greatest total ever reached . If sales then stay close to that mark in 1966 , the industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no one would have dared predict some time ago . One indication of just how high these sales rates are is the extent to which they exceed what auto economists consider " normal . " The auto seers base their estimate of what is normal on four factors : Population , income levels , serappage rates for old cars , and the rise in multi-car families , as more people decide two or three cars are necessary for suburban living . With all these indicators pointing up , economists had calculated that sales of 7.8 million to 8 million cars would have been normal this year , and sales of 8.2 million to 8.3 million would make 1966 a . normal year . Does the tact that current sales forecasts run so far above this indicate those forecasts may still be too high ? Quite the contrary , say the economists : Many figure it means their calculations of what is normal have been far too low , and will have to be raised . They can find no factors to point to a drop in sales rates greater than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysts , indeed , now figure that even it a general recession should hit the economy , and turn out to be as severe as the one in 1958 , it would cut auto sales only to about 7 million a year . That would have been considered a boom rate in the 1950a . Auto sales in the 1958 recession year were only 4.6 million , less than The volume expected in this year 's first half . One factor the auto men are counting on to prevent any marked drop in car sales is the expectation of excise tax cuts . These may result in sales of an extra 125,000 ears in the rest of 1965 , and perhaps 300,000 next year , they figure . Some other factors : The population spread bodes well for car sales . There now are 21.7 million " spending units , " or family groups , in the 35 to 54-year age group , the prime new-car buying group . A decade ago , in the 1955 boom , there were only 21.9 million in this group , which because of generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit hard in recessions . Family incomes are continuing to rise . This year the personal disposable income of Americans is running $30 billion above the 1964 pace , and $60 billion ahead of the 1963 rate . The Role of Price Stability Auto prices have remained stable for a half-dozen years , and , says one economist , are unlikely to rise at the factory next fall ; in the dealers ' showrooms they 'll drop , because of the prospective excise tax cuts . The average of all retail prices , by contrast , has risen 1.5% a year the past six years . Auto company economists in the past have given price stability little weight in preparing sales forecasts , but now they have concluded they underestimated its impact , and view it as highly important . " It may not mean much in one year , but when it accumulates it becomes significant , " says one economist . Another figures that if new-car prices had risen as much as prices generally in the last six years , a 1965 Chevrolet Impala would cost $450 more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chevrolet prices have held steady , he believes , has had the same effect that a $450 price cut would have had if non-auto prices had held unchanged . Nor does this measure the full impact of auto price stability . Used-car prices have risen along with most non-auto prices . So many a new-car buyer is getting a higher trade-in on his used car  --  and since the price of the new car has n't risen , he 's getting it at a lower net price than he would have a few years ago . Debt Debate Auto analysts can see only one potential offset to this array of favorable factors , beyond the increase in Social Security taxes due next year : Repayment of instalment loans now takes 14 cents out of every take-home pay dollar in the U.S. This , says one auto company economist , raises a possibility that consumers will take a " pause " to repay old debt , rather than incurring new debt to buy more new cars and other things . Other economists , however , doubt this will happen . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the limit , but then the 16-foot pole vault used to be taps , too , " says one . Others contend the repayment-obligation figure is high , not because habitual instalment borrowers are going more deeply Into debt , but because more people are using instalment credit , raising the repayment-obligation average for the whole population . Weighing all these factors , most auto economists agree with Lynn Townsend , president of Chrysler Corp. , that auto sales not only will stay high through 1966 , but will rise generally for several years beyond that , with only " shallow declines " interrupting the progress , Mr. Townsend already has predicted 10.5 million auto sales in 1970 , with a possibility that they could hit 12 million if the year is exceedingly good , or drop to 9 million  --  about equal to the current pace  --  if it is very bad . Goodbye . Sharp Ups and Downs ? " We are being forced to re-examine many of our traditional ways of thinking about such things as business cycles and long term business trends and potentials , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believing we may not again experience the violent ups and downs of earlier decades . " Auto makers already are expanding capacity to handle such a long-range sales rise . Chrysler has a new assembly plant under construction in Illinois , as well as new parts making plants and expansions at several locations . GM has a new car plant going up in Ohio , and though it wo n't be ready until next spring , the company last week announced a 20 ' , ' e expansion of this juststarted factory . Some auto makers probably will he announcing their 1966 capital spending plans shortly , and they are expected to total close to $2 billion .
