YES , WE STILL HAVE HAVANA , boasted an ad last week in the New York Times Magazine and other newspapers for the Garcia y Vega , Inc. cigar company , which has access to nearly half of the pre-Castro leaf still warehoused in the U.S. And yes , Garcia y Vega has the promotional services of one of the more fascinating authors in the nation . In return for mailing in ten bands from the company 's Elegantes or Gallantes ( list price : two for 250 ) , a cigar smoker can get a free copy of To Seek a Newer World ( list : $4.95 ) , a slim volume of essays by Senator Robert Kennedy . <P> The Senator gave his permission for such a puff even though the book seems to be doing well enough in the cash-and-carry market . In print only a month , the volume-which accuses President Johnson of having " cast away " a chance to negotiate an end to the Viet Nam war early in 1967-has recorded almost 40,000 sales . That 's not yet sufficient to recoup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Kennedy , but still it seems to be a brisk beginning .
