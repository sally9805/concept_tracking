txt The United States has begun to feel strong pressure for friendly coexistence with Cuba from a number of Latin-American republics . There also are strong indications that Cuba and the Soviet Union are most interested in an accommodation between Washington and Havana , according to diplomatic sources . This effort by Cuba and the Soviet Union is said to ' aim at reopening trade between the United States and Cuba to relieve the worsening food shortages and deteriorating economic situation plaguing the Havana regime . A second objective is believed to be the winning of Washington 's tacit acceptance of the existence of a Communist state in Cuba to increase the respectability of the Government of Premier Fidel Castro in Latin America . An inclination in the Western Hemisphere to accept the Castro regime as a member of the Inner American community in relatively good standing was reported to be developing . Curiously , the economic conference in progress in Punta Del Este , Uruguay , is reported to have ' strengthened , this trend , partly through -. the - efforts there of Maj. Ernesto Guevera , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States position that normal relations with =Cuba are out of the question as long as a Communist regime , apparently dedicated-to spreading its influence across Latin America and to the eradication of democratic institutions , remains in power in Havana . /kit the new pressures in favor of an accommodation are creating a political problem for Washington at a time when the policy here is to concentrate on the economic and social development of Latin America through President Kennedy 's Alliance for Progress program and , in effect , to isolate Cuba . Hopes Fade for Wide Talks Conversely , the sentiment that the Cuban issue is a. bilateral dispute between Havana and Washington is quietly killing the hopes held here earlier this year that the Punta Del Este economic parley might be followed by a political InterAmerican conference on the Castro regime . Continuing opposition from some of the key Latin-American Governments , like Brazil , Mexico and Chile , makes it unlikely that such a conference can be called in the foreseeable future , diplomats here believe . The Cuban interests in improving relations with the United States have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bySoviet diplomats in private conversations . At least , observers here said , Havana wishes ' to avoid Washington 's invoking of the Trading with the Enemy Act , which would cut off what remains of trade between the two countries . Airliner to Be Returned After having held a hijacked Eastern Air Lines Electra in Havana since July 24 , Premier Castro offered late last week to exchange the airliner for the return of a patrol boat brought to Key West , Fla. , by escaping Cubans . The exchange is to take place tomorrow . In a change of attitude , an official radio commentator in Havana had some kind words for President Kennedy for the first time in many months as he discussed last Thursday 's Presidential news conference . And observers here would not be surprised if the next step in Cuba 's current shift of policy were an application for membership in the InterAmerican Development Bank , through which much of the Alliance for Progress aid is to be dispensed to Latin America .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
