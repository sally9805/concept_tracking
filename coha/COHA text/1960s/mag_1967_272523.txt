The foreign ministers and special delegates from 13 Arab nations who met in steamy Khartoum last week were there to discuss ways and means of coping with their Israeli conquerors . As usual , they could not even cope with one another . <P> <P> Algeria and Syria demanded that all Arab nations 1 ) break cultural and diplomatic ties with the U.S. , Britain and West Germany for allegedly supporting Israel during the war , 2 ) organize a total trade boycott of the three countries , and 3 ) continue their current oil embargo . Egypt , Iraq and Republican Yemen were in general support . On the right , oil-rich Saudi Arabia , Kuwait and Libya-joined by Jordan , Tunisia and Morocco-insisted on maintaining all ties with the West and scrapping the oil embargo , which was costing each of them $500,000 a day in lost revenues . " It is time for the Arabs to stop blaming the United States for their failures and blame themselves , for the blame lies with us , " said Tunisia 's Justice Minister Mongi Slim . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberation Organization and a special Nasser guest in Khartoum , blasted right back , labeling Tunisian President Habib Bourguiba " a traitor to the Arab cause " for having advocated peace talks with Israel back in 1965 . Furious , Slim stormed out of the conference hall . " There is no justification for Mr. Shukairy 's presence , " he told reporters . The arguments increased in intensity until Syria 's Foreign Minister Ibrahim Makhous went on Khartoum television to announce that the whole conference was " a farce and a waste of time . " <P> <P> Hope for Yemen . One mildly hopeful note came when Egypt announced that it was ready to end its five-year war in Yemen , where 20,000 Egyptian troops are propping up a wobbly republican regime against 10,000 Saudi-supported tribesmen who want to restore the Imam Mohamed el Badr to his throne . Egyptian Foreign Minister Mahmoud Riad proposed that Egypt and Saudi Arabia revive their Jeddah Agreement of 1965 , which calls for formation of a caretaker government , a phased withdrawal of Egyptian forces , and a plebiscite among Yemeni tribesmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Saudi summer capital of Taif , King Feisal was " pleased " at Nasser 's offer , and the Imam-living in exile half a mile from Feisal 's summer palace-promised to send his rugged royalist troops to fight with Egypt against Israel , if Nasser finally does live up to the agreement he signed two years ago . <P> In the end , action on Yemen , as well as all other important decisions , was deferred for a future summit of Arab leaders . But the delegates were even having trouble agreeing on a time or a place for such a meeting .
