 | THE DEATH OF WEAKE In a remote corner of New Guinea , living among Stone Age tribes , an American novelist watched a strangely tender drama unfold when a young boy was killed by enemy spears . The boy Weake , whose violent death is described in the following pages , was a member of the Kurelu , a tribe of warriors in the Baliein Valley of Netherlands New Guinea . Because their corner of this great mountain valley was entirely unexplored , and because they were untouched by civilization , the Kurelu were chosen for study by the Harvard-Peabody Expedition , which visited them in the spring and summer of 1961 . Its purpose was to live among the people as unobtrusively as possible and to film and record their wars , rituals , and daily life with a minimum of interference , in order that a true picture of a Stone Age culture might be precerved. * The death of Weake occurred in June , a consequence of the ceaseless rhythm of wars and revenge on which the culture of the Kurelu and their neighboring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribes share common customs , dress , and language , and appear similar in every way . They fight neither for land nor food , for there is enough for all ? in the gardens outside their small village compounds , the people grow ample quantities of sweet potatoes and other vegetables , which they cultivate with wooden digging sticks , and they have , as well , small herds of pigs , usually tended by little boys like Weake . Their wars , which may take place several times each month , are a kind of ceremonial sport , a wild fierce festival , in which few warriors die . These are wars of individuals and gallantry , fought with long spears and crude bows and arrows , and innocent of *The members of the expedition included , besides the author : Robert Gardner , its leader ; Karl G.

A single death on either side can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a series of wars , come out ahead , the score must then be evened ; a raid or ambush is set in motion by the enemy , the purpose of which is the stalking and killing of a small party or an unwary individual . In June the Wittaia had fallen behind by several men , and Weake became a victim of their revenge . The expedition 's stay among the Kurelu offered a unique chance , perhaps the last , to describe a lost culture in the terrible beauty of its pure estate . Armed Dutch patrols and missionaries invaded the land of the Kurelu on the heels of the expedition ; and soon the proud and warlike Kurelu will be no more than another backward people , crouched in the long shadow of the white man . F 0 R several days the Wittaia , unable to effect a death in battle , had attempted a raid near the river . The Kurelu were aware of this , and none more so than the great warrior Weaklekek , who was responsible for the river kaio ? a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet high , where warriors gathered during the day to protect the women in the nearby gardens . Weaklekek 's kaio was strengthened by more warriors , who laid traps for the raiders , a common practice on both sides . In consequence , despite several alarms , no real battle had occurred . But on this morning the men did not go to the kaio , for a feast was taking place . No women were permitted in Weaklekek 's garden , and the kaio was abandoned for the day . The day was hot , and in the afternoon , a strange solitary man called Woluklek went clown to the river to drink water . Woluklek was followed on his way by three little boys who were playing near the village . The people tire of the stale silted waters of the ditches , and in dry weather they will often go a long way to squat on the river bank and drink slowly for minutes .  | One of the boys was Weake , whose father had been killed in the war the year before . His mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weake was now the ward of his uncle , the warrior Huonke . He was a small boy , perhaps eight , with the large eyes and thick eyebrows which make many of the Kurelu children beautiful . His name meant " Bad Path , " and recently he had hurt his leg . For this reason , on this day , he was slower than his friends . Near the river , on a little rise of wild sugar cane just short of the side path to Weaklekek 's kaio , Woluklek and the three boys were ambushed by a party of Wittaia ; the raiders sprang from the low reeds and bushes . Afterward , Woluklek was not sure about their numbers , but a raiding party is usually comprised of about thirty men . There was nothing to be done . He dropped his spear and fled , the boys behind him . A L L of his life Weake had been taught to hate and fear the enemy , and when he saw the strange men with their spears , he turned with the rest and ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost immediately run down . He screamed for help , but the others were running for their lives and did not turn . The face of a man , of several men , loomed above him on the bright blue sky . The men rammed their spears through him , over and over , pinning him to the ground , and then they were gone , and Weake was carried home . The alarm cry of " Kaio , kaio " carried to the pig feast , and soon word came about the boy . The pilai , or men 's roundhouse , where Weake lived was scarcely a hundred yards across the fences . His uncle , Huonke , and Huonke 's brother-in-law , Tamugi , ran toward Weake 's compound , where the women 's wailing had already started . In the long yard two women kneeled , facing the mute pilaf . The compound lies beneath the mountain , at the north end of a great grove of evergreens , and the pilai at its southern end is shaded by banana trees , with the tall pines beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few old men , and then the young war chief Asikanalek arrived , and Huonke , and Siloba , a young warrior . Weake lay on a banana frond beside the fire . He was still alive , and his clear , childish voice seemed out of place in the brown solemnity of the men 's roundhouse : it cut through the decrepit snuffling of the old men as the shaft of daylight in the doorway cut through the motes of dust . Weake spoke of his own etai-eken ? his seedof-singing , the life he clung to with all his strength ? as if the mourning already started must be some terrible mistake . " An etai-eken werek ! ? But I 'm alive ! " Though he not once screamed or whined , his voice was broken as he spoke by little calls of pain , and the blood flowed steadily and irreversibly onto the banana leaf beneath him . Huonke tried to quiet him , repeating the same terse phrase over and over , like a chant : " Hat nahalok loguluk ! Hat nahalok loguluk ! ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voice was the only firm one in the pilai . Tamugi , a large-muscled man whose ready smile is bolder than his nature , sobbed as loudly as he could , while Asikanalek cried silently . The boy 's voice answered Huonke obediently ? , pain or terror overcame him , and he cried out , and fought to escape the death that he felt in their hands . Huonke held his left arm and Siloba his right , while Tamugi and Asikanalek held down his legs . Siloba neither talked nor cried , but breathed earnestly and , ceaselessly into the boy 's ear , oo-Phuh , oo-Phuh : this ritual breathing , which brought health , would be used in the next hour on the sacramental pig meat . Weake twisted in their grasp , his back arching . His legs were released and he drew them into a foetal posture , covering the gleam of the neat spear holes at his navel and lower belly . The old cut on the boy 's leg still had its green patch of leaf dressing , but the spear holes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arm and leg and stomach , had not been tended . Some fresh leaf was brought at last , and the two stomach wounds were bound up hastily , almost carelessly , as if the true purpose of the leaf was to protect the pilai floor from blood ; in their distress the men handled him ineptly , and he cried out . The figures hunched over him in the near-darkness , with the old men 's snuffling and the steady oo-Phuh , oo-Phuh , and the tearing of the leaf . Behind Huonke , in the shadows , a woman sat as rigid as a stone . The custom excluding women from the pilai had been waived while the child lived , but nevertheless , she maintained  | silence ; when she spoke , but once , out of the darkness , her voice came clear and tragic , like a song . The woman was Huonke 's sister , married to Tamugi ; she has a sad wild quality in her face , and is one of the handsomest women in the Kurelu . She counseled the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E A K E clung to life and would not die . His writhings had covered him with blood , and he lay in a pool of darkness . When the woman had finished speaking , the men agreed to take him to the water which , entering his wounds , would leach out the dark blood of illness . He was picked up and carried outside , Siloba holding his head up by the hair . The women in the yard began an outcry , but the men did not pass through the yard . They took Weake through a hole in the back fencing , across a pig pasture , over a stile , down through a small garden to a ditch . There they lay him in the muddy water , so that it lapped up to his chest . Tamugi did not come . After leaving the pilai with the other men , he kept on going , for the rock fires of the feast had been opened , and he wished some pig . The others accompanied Huonke to the ditch . Soon they , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only Siloba remained with Huonke , and his friend , Yonokma . Yonokma sat in water up to his waist , holding the legs , while Huonke and Siloba , their own lower legs submerged , held the child 's arms ; Weake 's head rested on Huonke 's right thigh . Fitfully Weake talked and now and then cried out ; the voice rang through the silent garden , against the soft background of lament and the low hum of the men 's voices at the pig feast . Once he cried , " Tege ! Tege ! " in terror of the spears , and Huonke shouted him down " Hat ninom werek ! Hat ninom , werek ! " ? over and over and over . " You are here with us ! You are here with us ! " He said this mechanically every time Weake called out . " You are here with us . " Then Weake would resume his own meek , rhythmic Ole , oh , oh , of assent . His eyes closed , opened wide , and closed again ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its water spiders , round black beetles , and detritus of old leaves , his blood drifted peacefully away . Above him rose the great arches of the banana trees , and the hill crest in a softening light , and the blue sky . Swiftlets coursed the garden , hunting insects , and the mosquitoes came ? the men slapped one another . In his last sleep , Weake cried , a small ? pure sound which came with every breath . When pain awakened him , he tried to talk but his voice was BY PETER MATTHIESSEN 55 faint and drowsy . Siloba breathed fitfully into his ear , but his efforts were disheartened : he only did it , guiltily , when the little boy called out . The small slim body had more than twenty wounds , and the wonder was that the boy had lived so long . But Weake would live until the twilight , asleep in the healing water , while the men attending him grew tired and cold . Sometimes Siloba poured water on the wounds , and more blood flowed down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us , " and the child said , " Yes , Yes , Yes . " He did not speak again . A warrior came and stared at the little boy . He broke off the stem of a taro leaf , and with it probed the wound on the left side . He then attempted to push back a trace of white intestine which protruded near the navel as if , by concealing the evidence of hurt , he might somehow be of help . Weake was failing rapidly , and did not cry out ; his mouth was open , and his lips had puffed and dried . In the attack he had received a heavy blow , for the side of his face had grown swollen and distorted . Yonokma leaned forward and removed a bit of straw from the dry lips . The warrior ran across the garden and sprang onto the roof of the pig shed by the fence . There , with a great cracking sound like anger , he broke off a large banana frond and hurled it down into the yard : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Returning , he picked Weake up out of the water and carried him homeward through the garden . Huonke and the others trailed him through the dusk , shaking with cold . The small body was limp , with one foot lying on the other , and arms hanging ; the blood dripped very slowly on the weeds . His breathing had silenced , and his eyes , half-closed , had glazed , like those of a fresh-killed animal . The war chiefs came to look at him in his pilai , but it was evening now and he was dead . T H E next morning in the middle of the yard where Weake had lived , Huonke and Tamugi built the chair in which he would sit during the long funeral ceremony . While it stood this was the only piece of furniture in the village . Straight-backed as a throne , its seat high off the ground , it was a makeshift of split laths and saplings lashed together with lianas , with green fronds lining its seat and back . Four women emerged from the cooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already climbing the stile which separated this small yard from the main compound of the great chief  | Wereklowe , the head of the Alua clan to which Weake belonged . The wailing had commenced , and the Alua were coming across the fields from all across the southern Kurelu . In the pilai crouched Asikanalek , the young war chief , twisted by grief . Against the wall , where sunlight filtered through the chinks , sat Weake 's small silhouette , already arranged in the position he would be given in the chair . Asikanalek went to him and carried him outside into the day . Still holding the boy , he kneeled in the bright sun before the pilai and , staring upward at the sky , lamented . The men about him looked disheveled and distraught , and Asikanalek 's shoulders were smeared with the yellow clay of mourning . Weake 's appearance in the yard had caused a stir among the women , and the long clay of fierce wailing now began . Weake was carried to his chair . His bound legs were hung over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a strip of leaf passed by Tamugi beneath his chin . At the foot of the chair , wailing , Tamugi 's wife crouched upon the ground and mopped at it with torn-up grass ; she made a circular motion with her hand , scarring the earth . Other women , with girls and small children , filed steadily into the yard , arranging themselves upon the ground before lending their voices to the waves of sound . The men draped shell belts on Weake , binding his brow with the bright colors and building the belts into a kind of crown . But his head was small , and most of the belts were laid along his sides and down the chair arms . While his attendants scratched and shuffled and thought thoughts , in the warm doldrums of their existence , the child sat alone in cold serenity . He seemed to grieve , nevertheless , as if oppressed by all his trappings ; when the women hung new fiber nets upon his chair , they almost hid him in the shadows . To assuage the spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the small shins , still in the sun , gleamed . A group of elders sang wheezily and long the ancient chants of mourning , working the ground with gnarled old toes and rubbing spavined thighs . One of them , his wrinkled skin reptilian , felt peevishly for the tobacco roll buried in the pouch strung on his back . At the same time , he contributed his mourning , a frail woo , woo , woo , and his long nose ran tumultuously with all the rest : the hole for boar 's tusks in his septum had stretched wide with old age , so that the light shone through it . MICHAEL ROCKEFELLER  | @# Some of these guests brought shell belts ? long woven strands adorned with cowrie shells and red and yellow bands of orchid fiber ? and Huonke called out to them in greeting , a loud wah-h , wah-h , somehow impertinent , and at the same time self-ingratiating . He and his brotherin-law stood at the chair and haggled covertly about the placement of the belts . At the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frank , open face of cant . Four pigs were brought forth , and an elder destroyed them with a kind of sad authority , shooting arrows into their lungs from close range . All four died speedily , spouting the ground , legs kicking , as if they were trying to bore into the earth . They were dressed swiftly , and the boys brought logs . The mourning continued , and more people came . Huonke and Tamugi cried loud and long , mouths trembling and eyes alert . They watched the entrance of Weaklekek , his people behind him carrying three large flat stones , decorated around the middle with fur and cowries . These stones are valuable but not sacred , though they may later become so ; they are used like the cowrie belts as a medium of exchange . Weaklekek 's party stopped before the chair to grieve , and then the men went onward toward the pilaf . Weaklekek sat down quietly and stared into the earth . Plainly he blamed himself for the boy 's death , since it was his kaio that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of existence , and neither Weaklekek nor Woluklek were blamed by any of the others . Even so , Woluklek , who had been unwise enough to lead the three boys to the river , did not come to the funeral at all . T H E little girls of the village were going about on small , self-conscious errands ; the girls smiled modestly at everyone , in the pretty illusion that all eyes were upon them . One of them , very young , had a poor grasp of the situation , but she took up the wail of mourning , humming it contentedly to her own rhythms . A little boy , escaping his mother repeatedly , played in the narrow path through the massed women ; like most of the children , he accepted his mother 's cuffs and cries in great good spirits , and smiled expansively at all and everything even when latecomers stepped upon him . He was finally placed in the care of an older child , who took him to a corner of the yard and picked lice from his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they overflowed into the woods behind the fencing . The mourning faltered in the midday pall , and nothing stirred . At three places near the main entrance of the village , the tips of long grasses had been tied together in a kind of arch . These grass signs were a warning to the women , who were nearly two hundred strong , and whose use of the near weeds to urinate had become an offense to Wereklowe , the Alua chief . The rock fire was dismantled , and pig distributed among the men . A few bits were borne to certain women , but the rest had to be content with the sweet potato passed around by NVeake 's little sister . During the eating , soft waves of mourning rose and fell . The sun , sliding down into the west , burned hotly on Weake 's body and women tried to shield it with their nets . But now the men came forward and stripped it of the belts : the meal was over , and the day 's business must begin . A funeral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those who had brought offerings expected something in return . The shell belts were stretched on a banana frond before the pilai , with the chiefs seated in a line along each side . When the belts had been admired for a time , and their destiny decided , Wereklowe stood up to dispense them . Until this time , Wereklowe had remained out of the way , ceding the administration of the funeral to Asikanalek : Asikanalek was not only a sub-chief of the clan Alua but a fine warrior and a close relative of the dead boy . But the exchange of goods was an end purpose of the funeral , and the greatest leader of the clan directs it . With a weighty pause between each name , Wereklowe gave out the shell belts ; he was attended by respectful silence . One belt was awarded to Weaklekek , but Weaklekek was still morose , and waved it off ; in his despair , and despite all his rich gifts , he felt he did not deserve it . His wife , more practical , came forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E S P I T E the great amount of grieving , there seemed small hint of outrage . Huonke complained that the enemy should not have killed Weake , but then , Huonke had killed once himself , a harmless woman found near the frontier who had run away from her own people . Revenge there would be , inevitably , but without moral judgments . Nevertheless , for the funeral of a small boy , several hundred people had pushed into the small yard : more presents were brought and more pigs killed than for the funerals of ordinary warriors . Only a few could have come there in real sorrow , and only a few for the exchange of goods . The rest had come because the killing of a child , despite its ancient sanctions , had made them unhappy and uneasy . His back to Wereklowe , the child sat naked in the chair . The women started to remove the nets , and Weake stirred ; his head dropped slowly to his breast , for his chin strap had been loosened from behind . Weake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belts had lain . The boys and men brought long laths for the pyre , and the mourning quickened . Huonke greased the body a last time and , when he was finished , took up a bow and arrow . Another man held up a great thatch bundle . The arrow was shot into it , releasing the spirit from the body , and the man ran out of the yard with the bundle , escorting it from the village : the spirit had now become the ghost and would go off into enemy country where , by causing trouble and dissension , it would abet the cause of its own people in the wars to come . The fire had been assembled quickly , and a loud outcry erupted with the flames : the body was hurried to its pyre . Weake was laid upon his side , in the way that small boys sleep , with one of the laths pillowing his head . The flames came up beside him , and more laths were laid on top of him , and he disappeared . The last of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carried upward by an acrid smoke from the crackling pyre , and diffusing itself at last against the pine trees , the high crest of the mountain wall , the sky . T H E following morning , to show respect for the dead boy , a ritual mutilation was performed ; the two outer joints were removed from two fingers of Weake 's sister , Iki Abusake , and of three other little girls . A half-hour before the ceremony , the fingers had been bound tight , to cut off circulation ; just prior to the operation , each child was struck forcibly on the upper arm , to render the hand numb . The fingers were placed on a piece of wood , and severed with a blow of a stone adze . This latter task had been performed by Tamugi who is considered skillful in such matters . One little girl is Wereklowe 's niece ; another the daughter of a warrior who , having neither pig nor stone to bring to the funeral , offered the finger of his child . A third is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of these girls had taken the place of another child , who had gotten hysterical and run off . Though this little girl had been beaten , she had not been  | @# forced back to the ceremony ; as in the case of cowardly men on days of war , her shame is thought to be sufficient punishment . At three years , Weake 's sister Iki Abusake is the smallest of the girls , though the other children can not be more than four . The children sat together in the cooking shed . Their hands had been bandaged heavily in leaves , bound round with grass , and to slow the bleeding , each held the green mass upright , beside her face , like a toy or present to be shown to friends . The hands bled badly all that morning , and each little girl held a clump of grass under her elbow to absorb the blood . None of them gave evidence of more than slight discomfort , but all were silent in a way that children rarely are , and the eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were round with shock . Their relatives talked quietly to the little girls , and after a while they were taken out into the yard . Many women had come , for this was their occasion , and they sat talking cheerfully by the funeral ashes . The finger-cutting , like the funeral itself , had its practical side : it was a kind of holiday for the women , and would inaugurate a day-long feast of sweet potato , quite similar to the second day of the men 's feast being observed across the fences . The women made a kind , mild fuss over the little girls , but otherwise no notice was taken of them . They were fed sweet potato , and ate it . Tamugi 's wife sat by herself , picking the bones of VTeake out of the ashes . She used a small wooden tongs , and she laid the white scraps in a little pile on a banana leaf . The motion of her arm , though sure and graceful , was infinitely slow , as if she were entranced . Her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others without really seeing them . When her task was finished , she folded the leaf over the bones and took them away into the cooking shed . The following day , they would be buried . The few men in the yard kept out of the women 's way , but late in the afternoon , they asserted themselves once more . They raised a shout , and the boys came flying up the yard through the packed women , hurling stones at the fences and gateway and crying out : this was the banishment of Weake 's ghost , reminding it of its journey to the Wittaia . The boys came back laughing , and all the women laughed as well , for the ghost-stoning is a constructive ceremony from which nothing but good could come . On the third day of the funeral , another sweet- potato feast was held , this time in the sili of Wereklowe . Among matters discussed were steps to be taken in the future to safeguard the river frontier , as well as the details of the retaliatory raid which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass unavenged . Another enemy , and preferably more than one , would pay for the death of Weake : that Weake had died as a result of the death of the Wittaia warrior Huwai , or of Owak , Tegeaolok , Wie , Haknisek , or Mali ? all five of whom had died of wounds received in recent moons in battle ? was not the point . The feast was scarcely started when an alarm cry came out of the east , and this time the yard emptied of its warriors . The Wittaia were said to have struck again , on the mountain path , killing women and children . The warriors ran in a swift loping stride , up across the fields above the villages , into the trees . But the alarm was born of the high tensions of days past ; if there had been Wittaia on the mountain , no trace of them was found . The men came down the hill , and the feasting was resumed . Once again , to shouts and laughter , Weake 's ghost was sent upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these days the grass near the place of ambush was burned and burned again . Weake 's ghost would linger near even a faint trace of his blood , and would not , until all blood was gone , be free to cross into the country of the enemy . U N T I L the death of Weake has been avenged , a kind of altar will be maintained within the cooking shed , where two of the funeral nets still hang upon the wall . The tails of the slaughtered pigs are fastened to the nets , and with them a stalk of too , a heavy-bodied cultivated grass which tastes like a fine mixture of artichoke and celery ; Weake had been fond of too , and its place on the nets is designed to please his ghost . In the rafters above hangs a grass bundle , used commonly as a sign to ghosts that all has been taken care of , and that therefore they need not loiter but should get on about their business . When a Wittaia has been killed by ' Weake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken down . The death of Weake was not called out to the Wittaia , for this was scarcely necessary ; nonetheless , the enemy staged a victory dance . The boy 's mother , who had run off to the Wittaia the year before , was certainly aware of Weake 's identity ; but what part she played in the enemy celebration the people did not know . @#
