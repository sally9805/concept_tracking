He was both poet and physician , each as a profession in itself , and each thanks to the other . He had mastered the knack of treating poems as patients and patients as poems , and both were the better for it . His life was in careful balance . <P> <P> William Carlos Williams lived a half-mile from his birthplace in Rutherford , N.J. He found ample fascination for both his curiosities in life along the Passaic River-in his little town and in the ugly , faceless towns around it . He practiced medicine there for 40 years , a tough but generous doctor with a humanist 's simple notion of his work : " I 'm a pediatrician . I take care of babies and try to make them grow . I enjoy it . Nothing is more appropriate to a man than an interest in babies . " <P> <P> Between patients , he wrote poems , but he never had to struggle to keep the poet from wasting the doctor 's good time : when patients called , the poet was uninterrupted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of art , " he once wrote , " makes him somehow come alive to me . " In his poems , the patients moved among the hard images of industrial New Jersey and the harder images of brutality the poet found there . His poems were like snapshots-rough , direct , staccato glimpses : <P> got ta hold your nose <P> with the appropriate gesture <P> smiling back of the garbage truck as the complex city passes to the confession or psychiatric couch or both He wrote of the poor and sick and dirty , and in Paterson , his masterpiece , he achieved a Whitmanesque vision of the American myth as he told of the city 's dying , thirsty waterfalls and of trees stunted by concrete and grime . In Spring Storm , he saw nature 's liberation of the cold earth as a hint of higher human values : <P> The sky has given over <P> its bitterness <P> Still the snow keeps its hold on the ground <P> But water , water <P> from a thousand Runnels ! <P> It collects swiftly , <P> dappled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice in the gutters . <P> <P> He was a hero to abstract painters and to beat generation poets because of his spare , free language and his steady devotion to the American idiom . In the U.S. , many considered him the most influential of the poets ' poets , but in Europe , he remained a mystery . Verses like <P> You can do lots if you know <P> what 's around you <P> No bull are true and satisfying in New Jersey , but in Europe they are baffling in the best translations . <P> <P> He was uncritically generous-at birth , any little quarterly could count on a blurb and a bouquet of free poems as a present from him . He had no vanity , no avarice , no conceit , but he had strong and angry flashes of pride that described him perfectly in his poet 's pose : <P> Say I am less an artist <P> than a spadeworker but one <P> who has no aversion to taking <P> his spade to the head <P> of any who would derogate <P> his performance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
