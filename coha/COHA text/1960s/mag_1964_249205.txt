Everyone knows what happens when a would-be suicide closes the garage door , runs a hose into his car from the tail pipe , and sits inside the car with the engine running . Carbon monoxide , in such heavy doses , is one of the deadliest of gases . It gets into the blood and starves the brain of vital oxygen . The victim turns red and usually dies . But doctors have been arguing for decades about the effects of small doses of monoxide poison over long periods . Only recently have they begun to collect evidence that such small doses may do permanent damage to the brain . <P> One trouble is that moderate monoxide poisoning produces symptoms so confusing that they baffle the most ingenious and elaborate diagnostic methods . In the New England Journal of Medicine , Yale University Neurologists Gordon J. Gilbert and Gilbert H. Glaser reported the particularly bizarre case of a New Haven traffic cop who sometimes seemed to be " overly jocular and playful " but more often was true to his trade-nervous and irritable . Nearly every afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sleepy and got the staggers . Sometimes he became unconscious for 15 minutes to 1 hours . <P> <P> After a year of these symptoms , the cop took a transfer to the police garage , where he worked as a mechanic . He got no better and wound up in the Yale-New Haven Medical Center , where he soon improved and began gaining weight-only to have a severe relapse after six months back on the job . What helped the doctors clear up his case was the fact that the cop sometimes took a holiday down on the farm , working a tractor that required him to walk behind it . Helped by tractor-engine exhaust , his vacation " cure " gave him the same nervous-system symptoms as he had had in the city : abnormal brain waves , mental dullness , inability to concentrate , and tremor . <P> Most medical men believe that the body flushes out carbon monoxide quickly after a return to breathing pure air . The Yale neurologists say this may not always be true after repeated exposures , and certainly not for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of monoxide 30 hours after exposure to the fumes . European experiments with lab animals confirm the growing suspicion that leaky stovepipes , rusted-out mufflers , and running a car for even a few minutes inside a garage may involve greater and more subtle dangers than doctors have realized .
