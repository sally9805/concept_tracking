txt President Kennedy accused the Senate today of interfering with his conduct of foreign policy by unwarranted cuts and policy restraints in foreign aid . The Senate responded by cutting deeper into the foreign aid fund authorization . Tonight , with the bill near final passage , the measure ran into further trouble over a proposed amendment that imperiled the sale of grain to Communist countries . A showdown was put off until tomorrow . Obviously nettled by the $480 million reduction already approved by the Senate in the $4.2 billion measure and at new restrictions on his discretion to use the funds , the President told his news conference : " I can not fulfill my responsibility in the field of foreign policy without this pro gram . " Question 9 , Page 18 . A ' Dangerous World ' Mr. Kennedy said the Senate 's action had " severely limited " his ability to protect the nation 's interest abroad . He went on to say that it was " a very dangerous and untidy world " but that the nation had to live with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to function flexibly in dealings with other nations . He added : " If we do n't function the voters will throw us out . But do n't make it impossible for us to function by legislative restraints or inadequate appropriations . " A few hours later the Senate whacked $20 million more from the authorization measure and added another restriction on the President 's use of military assistance funds . Alliance Fund Cut The additional cut brought the Senate 's total reductions within $200 million of the House-passed ceiling of $3.5 billion . The President 's asking figire was $4.5 billion . The latest Senate excision .. ! aine out of the $175 million recommended by the Foreign Relations Committee for the so:gal progress trust fund of the Alliance for Progress with Latn America . Not a voice was raised , igainst this proposal by Sena or Wayne Morse , Democrat of Dregon , spokesman for the liberals ' revolt against foreign aid . Even its author declined to urge on the Senate , explaining that was then under discussion in the cloakroom . The Oregon Senator did say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Combined leadership , he would make no further effort to reduce the authorization measure . That was enqugh . Senator J. W. Fulbright announced that the amendment was acceptable and it was adopted by a voice vote . From then on it was only a question of how long it would take the Senate . to bring . the $3,702,000,000 authorization bill to a vote on final passage . About 40 amendments remained to be considered . But their sponsors began withdrawing them on a single objection from Senator Fulbiight and it was clear that the Senate wanted to push the foreign aid measure through . The new policy directive written into the bill forbids the granting of military aid to Latin-American countries except when the President determined it to be in furtherance of United States security or a safeguard of an Alliance for Progress member against military overthrow of its duly constituted government . The President had been asked at his news " conference whether the Administration was preparing against the possibility that Congress might ' one day refuse to authorize funds for foreign aid . His initial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so unwise " unless we are going to retreat from the world ? give up in South Vietnam ? give up in Latin America . " " I ca n't imagine anything more dangerous that to end this ' program , " he added . " I can assure you that whoever is President of the United States succeeding me will support this program . " The President went on to ex , plain that the sum he had requested for foreign aid in the current fiscal year , which started July 1 , was $1 billion less than the average outlay since 1947 . On the other hand , the need today is much greater than in ' the early nineten fifties when the expenditure on foreign aid was three times the present burden , he insisted . Sees No End in Sight Mr. Kennedy asserted that what he found so hard to understand was " why we are so suddenly fatigued " in the struggle to build and maintain free societies when everyone knew that it was a continuing effort that would not end in this century . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told the Senate as it went into its fifth night session on the bill that Mr. Kennedy had spoken " more ' in wrath than with logic . " Mocking the ' President for " engaging in the same old non sequitur that it is he who must ' get the blame if . anything goes wrong with foreign policy , " Mr. Morse said : " He should be less concerned with who gets the blame and more with the kind of reforms we have been trying here to write into the foreign aid program . " " What 's blame got to do with it ? " Mr. Morse inquired of the few members in their seats at the dinner hour . " We all get the blame if there is not an end to the shocking waste that the Controller General has found to honeycomb this program . " The President says he does n't understand this sudden fatigue over foreign aid . Who 's fatigued ? We 're not fatigued with working for a. good foreign aid program , but we 're sick and tired of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year after year . " The Oregon Senator had held off replying to the President throughout the afternoon and the vigor of his rebuttal later was considered a measure of his chagrin over the 78-11 defeat he sustained on a proposal to cut off aid to junta regimes . Senator Morse had claimed State Department approval of his anti-junta amendment and appeared surprised when Mr. ' Fuibright challenged him on the point . Senator Fulbright said the department 's position was merely that it " could live with " the proposal . Following defeat of this plan , Senator Morse called up the toughest of some 20 amendments he had offered . It would have limited aid to no more than 50 countries and would have required that all aid be cut off to this number by June 30 , 1965 unless they could report progress on land and tax reforms , promoting freedom and free enteprise . This amendment also revived an already defeated proposal fixing interest rates on longterm development loaned at no less than the cost of borrowed money to the Treasury Department . The amendment lost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3.5 billion House bill for the Senate 's own battered but higher authorization . The plan lost , 68 to 15 . Trouble Over Grain Toward the end of the night session Senator Mike Mansfield , the Democratic leader , moved to table and kill an amendment by Senator Karl E. Mundt , Republican of South Dakota . It would have prohibited the Export-Import Bank , or other Federal agencies from underwriting private grain transactions , such as the projected sale of wheat to the Soviet Union or of corn to Hungary . The amendment had been expanded to include exports of any kind to any Communist country . The motion to kill further consideration of this plan was defeated 46 to 40 . Then , to forestall a possible favorable vote on the amendment , the Democratic leader moved for a recess of the session until noon tomorrow . It was then 10:37 P.M. and the motion carried 68-17 . Sees Underlying Motive With more than a hint of bitterness and frustration in his voice Mr. Kennedy condemned Senate amendments ? most of them identical with provisions of the House-passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must terminate aid to countries like Indonesia , the United Arab Republic and others acting contrary to United States policy . Underlying such restrictive policy restraints , the President suggested , is a dislike of Senators for some national leader or some national policy . He asked why some Latin-American countries should be deprived of economic aid because they defined their territorial waters differently from the United States and sought to penalize American fishing vessels that operated within them . These are matters for negoti-i ations , he said . So are questions of aid to Indonesia or Egypt , he went on ,
