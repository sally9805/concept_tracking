txt ACCOUNTANT TOOK ESTES ' OWN WORD ON HIS FINANCES Testifies to House Panel He ? in Effect Endorsed in 1961 a Misleading Statement BOND ON GRAIN IS CITED Texan Used Document in Bid to Agriculture Department to Keep Security Down Ay PETER BRAESTRUP Special to The New York Times . . ? WASHINGTON , June 2 ? A West Texas accountant has told House investigators that in effect he endorsed a misleading financial statement submitted by . Billie So/ Estes in 1961 to the Department of Agriculture . The statement was submitted on the accountant 's stationery . It was one of the documents used successfully last year by Mr. Estes to support his contention that the Agriculture Department need not raise the required bond on his expanding Federally subsidized grain storage facilities from $700,000 to $1,000,000 . Winn . P. Jackson or Lubbock , the accountant , said that he had been taken in by Mr. Estes ' repute as a multi-millionaire " Christian business man " in accepting his own account of his financial status in 1960 without checking the books . Technically , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as correct . Calls Report Worthless He added that , professionally , his report was worthless . If he received such a report , Mr. Jackson said , " I would file it in the wastebasket . " Mr. Estes was arrested March 29 on Federal charges of fraud . He is free on bail . The Jackson testimony , released today , was taken in closed session Monday by the House Intergovernmental Relations subcommittee . The panel is one of several conducting inquiries into the bankrupt Estes grain storage , cotton and fertilizer empire . The Jackson testimony was seen- as particularly relevant to House investigators because it referred to one of the documents cited this week by Department of Agriculture witnesses as cause for not raising Mr. Estes ' bond last year . In his testimony , Mr. Jackson said that he had had only minor dealings with Mr. Estes until early 1961 , when the Pecos financier offered him a $500-a-month retainer to do occasional auditing work . The young auditor , in business for himself less than a year at the time , said he had thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , probably again , and that my ship had really come in . " " So I managed to squeak out a ' yes ' , " he said . A. few days later , Mr. Jack // son said , he got a letter from Mr. Estes saying , " I am going to send you a financial statement and would you please put it on your stationery . " After he received the financial statement , Mr. Jackson said , he talked to Mr. Estes on the telephone . He declared : " I told Mr. Estes that I would have to . . . do some checking . . . and he said ' it is all right , there is nothing wrong with it .. . you know , it 's right to the penny . ' Everyone thought that he was such a Christian gentleman and , with this wide reputation , I made the mistake of believing him . .. so I prepared it on my own stationery . " Under questioning by the House subcommittee chairman , Representative L. H. Fountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made no examinations of Mr. Estes ' books or records , and simply mailed his version of the statements back to Mr. Estes . They showed a net worth of $13,734 , - 954 although at the time Mr. Estes was in financial trouble . Contained a Disclaimer " At the time , " Mr. Jackson said , " I certainly did n't have any reason to doubt his net worth . " Yet , as he noted , his own certified public accountant 's statement , accompanying the balance sheet , dated Feb. 14 , 1961 , contained a disclaimer . It read as follows : " No opinion may be expressed as to the fairness of presentation in the accompanying balance sheet of the financial . position of Billie Sol . Estes . " If he were to receive a balance sheet with such a statement attached by the accountant , Mr. Jackson said , " I would file it in the wastebasket as far as depending on it for anything . " " Because , any time that you can not get a C. P. A. to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audit work or what was done to establish the figures , " , he added . However , last Tuesday a Department of Agriculture witness ' testimony on Mr. Estes ' grain warehouse bonding included references to Mr. Jackson 's report . The witness was S. R. Smith , administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service . He said : " In view of the net worth reported by the C. P. A. ( Mr. Jackson as of the end of 1960 and by Billie Sol Estes in his I ownl financial statement submitted as of June 30 , 1961 , the U. S. Warehouse Act program ' adminstrators did not deem additional bond necessary and coverage remained at $700,000 . " A week or two after he did the job for Mr. Estes , Mr. Jack son said , he got a $6,000 check from Mr. Estes as his retainer in advance . After the Estes case broke , Mr. Jackson said , he destroyed the two balance sheets Mr. Estes had mailed to him and that he had copied on his stationery and returned . I This account of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplied to the panel earlier by Department of Agriculture investigators . The two investigators , Cecil C. Perry and John Baskin , Ireported in a memorandum that on April 30 this year : " We interrogated Jackson regarding destruction of the working papers . He stated that ' he received a call from an em-1 ploye of Billie Sol Estes who suggested that he might want to destroy the working papers for Jackson 's benefit , and later stated , ' for their mutual advantage . ' Asked about this by the Fountain panel Monday , Mr. Jackson said he had received no such telephone call .
