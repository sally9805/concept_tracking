txt  | tive structure , lingering from a period just beyond the frontier of our investigations . Highly analytic Chinese today shows signs of developing in the direction of agglutination . In contemporary Chinese there are many word-combinations which are used together so regularly as to suggest that they have really agglutinated into a single disyllabic ( or even trisyllabic ) word . On the other hand , it was probably Bopp who first pointed out the similarity between the personal endings of the verb in Indo-European and the personal pronouns and third-person demonstratives ( cf. Greek ea- ? i EQ-Qi , ( ; F - Ti ( The similarity between o-6i and au , however , is accidental . ) Not enough is yet known about the polysynthetic languages to surmise from what sort of structure they developed ; but we can speculate a priori that the first development from a polysynthetic structure would be the invention of words , probably through the sort of tautology that already arises in such languages , that is , starting with a sentence-word defined by names " loving-someone-he ( or she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loves Jane " ) ? the sentence complex may , because of the tautology , lose its self-contained character and become " loves John Jane , " whereupon it might become also possible to say " loves he her , " the structure now having three distinct words , none of them equivalent to a sentence . ( It is interesting to note that a Latin form like amat was originally equivalent to a sentence , meaning " he loves someone , " until the persons were defined by tautological words : amat Ioannes loannam ) . But a polysynthetic language which developed words would probably then be classifiable as agglutinating . A hypothetical illustration might make clearer the way in which a language of one structural type could develop into another . Let us suppose that , in some Creolized dialect of English , the indication of subject and object by position in the sentence was imperfectly understood , and it became customary to use pronouns for clarity : " This man calls that man " might become " This man , he call him that man , " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be analytic structure , with " he " and " him " counting as formants expressing structural morphemes , but having the status of free forms ( i.e. , independent words ) . In time , however , these words might coalesce ( agglutinate ) with the word " man " ; however , as long as they were easily recognizable , occurred elsewhere as free forms , and coalesced in different combinations  | in other words , the structure of the language would be agglutinating . But eventually they might lose identity except as endings , and we would say that the " paradigm " of the " declension " of the word man was : Table We might then have sentences like mani kill bossim , give bossiz money other mantu , and the language would have become inflecting . All in all , the investigator who is not hampered by Spencerian pseudo-evolutionism may well be inclined to imagine that change in language goes in a great cycle which makes one revolution every five or six thousand years , as represented graphically in Figure 11 . The span of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Analytic among the languages of Europe . 3 . Indo-European and its descendants We have already seen ( page 51 ) how the discovery that tongues so little in contact as Sanskrit and Latin were descended from the same tongue provided the impetus that started the scientific study of language . The task of finding out all the descendants of that language and ascertaining the line of their descent was , as we have seen , the main occupation of linguistics for most of the nineteenth century and indeed still continues ( see Chapter XV ) . It makes , in fact , a sort of detective story , and if it were told in the classic detective-story sequence ? from the result back to the ultimate origins of the crime ? it might have a considerable amount of suspense and excitement . But it will probably be clearer if we do it the other way and , summarizing all that has been discovered so far , tell the story from its beginning to its consequences in the present day . ( Bear in mind that many details are still moot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the author 's conclusion as to the most probable theory on each such disputed point . ) It would appear that a very long time ago ? about 2500 to 2000 B.C. to be a little more exact ? there lived in the interior of eastern Asia  | Minors a people who called themselves something like Arya ( the Sanskrit form : the root is found also in Ir-an , Ar-menia , Ire-land ) , but who are referred to nowadays most generally as Indo-Europeans . ' We are not sure whether the whole nation was of the same race ? for linguistic unity does not presume racial unity , as almost any nation can demonstrate ? but there probably was an " Indo-European race " which dominated the nation . Though already in use in Egypt , the art of writing ( see Chapter VII , 3-4 ) had not yet reached the Indo-Europeans , and so they left no written documents , which are , after all , the chief basis of history . What we know of the Indo-Europeans is therefore based mainly on inferences from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a descendant in all or most of the languages derived from Indo-European designated a concept which was at least known to the IndoEuropeans , not discovered later by one of their descendant tribes . On this evidence it would seem that they did not live near the water , but among forests ; that they had such domestic animals as the horse and dog ; that kinship was featured prominently in their social organization . They were hunters and raisers of dairy stock and may have kept kitchen gardens , but were not " dirt farmers . " Their religion was probably pantheistic . ' From their conquests it is safe to conclude that they were especially valiant warriors . We may learn something about them , too , by studying the oldest customs of their oldest descendants ? especially those which are paralleled by similar customs among other Indo-European peoples whose history we can trace back equally or almost as far . Thus , the use of cattle for money is found among the early Irish and among the early Romans ; the tactic of fighting from chariots is common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a class of bards or rhapsodes , and from comparison of the earliest legends of the Indo-European peoples , we have a more than sketchy idea of the repertoire of these artists . No doubt the Indo-Europeans were mentioned in Egyptian chronicles and in the oral annals , later written down , of the Hebrews ; but the problem is to identify which non-Egyptian and non-Semitic race appearing in these sources were the Indo-Europeans . Some think that the Hittites or Hethites of the Bible ( the Khatti of Egyptian records ) ' may have been the Indo-Europeans , and it is established that their  | language was of the Indo-European family ; but no contemporary linguists believe it was the Indo-European language . The IndoEuropeans might also have been the Scythians described by Herodotus.10 At all events , it seems clear that shortly after 2000 B.c. , the IndoEuropean nation was subjected to such extreme pressure by tribes moving into Asia Minor from the plains of Asia " that it broke up , left the homeland , and migrated in many different directions . Some of its members moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea , and their descendants a few centuries later appear in history as the Ionian Greeks . Some apparently followed the same coastline around to Greece , and their descendants are known to us as Attic Greeks . Some appear to have continued to the Adriatic coast and made their way into Italy , while others moved through central Europe ? then , perhaps , a largely uninhabited land of great primeval forests ? until they ultimately reached the British Isles . Some crossed the Ionian Sea to Crete , where they overthrew the Minoan civilization , and later its colony in Sparta . One or more divisions seem to have gone northward and eastward , circling the Black Sea until they reached the fertile Ukrainian plains . And one adventurous branch struck out to the southeast , eventually , after traversing arid deserts and great mountains , to reach India ? but not before leaving colonies which were to grow into the nations of Persia and Afghanistan . Considering how far they spread , how many pre-existing populations they must have overcome , and how many great cultures developed among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indo-Europeans were quite a remarkable people . The fact that they are unmentioned in conventional history books is a lesson not to use these latter as an " argument from silence . " These migrations are known to us from linguistic evidence , not historical , but ? except in details ? they are not less certain for that . They are arrived at by the simple yet perfectly sound process of plotting the present location of languages proved to be descended from IndoEuropean , and then surmising what migrations and what point of origin could best account for the present distribution of the languages of the Indo-European family . Figures 12 and 13 summarize all this information in the form of a  | map and genealogical chart . The topmost level represents the immediate descendants of Indo-European languages which came into being about or shortly after 1500 B.c. ; the bottom one , the languages of IndoEuropean descent in the world today . Note that the so-called " Romance " languages ( French , Spanish , Italian , Romanian , and their dialects ) are not descended directly from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descendant . Naturally some of the finer points of the relationships of these languages to each other , and their consequent location on the chart , are still subject to discussion and revision . This scheme of classification will account for all the languages today spoken in Europe ( excepting only those to be described in the next section ) and , of course , for the dominant languages of many countries in North America and elsewhere , where Indo-European tongues have become established in the last three centuries . Figure 14 presents a plotting of what might be called the " colonies " of the IndoEuropean languages , with the approximate number of native speakers and the approximate time when they were first brought to each area , frequently suppressing local indigenous languages . Of course , before Indo-European speech spread across Europe there were many earlier languages , about some of which ( e.g. , Basque , Etruscan ) we know more than a little , while others are only names preserved in history . But we have not space here to recount what is known about the linguistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its first descendants , were of the highly inflecting type ? indeed , almost any of them might serve as a model for the category . But , during the last thousand years , a tendency toward economy has operated upon them in different degrees until the present-day descendants of Indo-European are all more or less squarely in the analytic column . Compare the analyses of Latin and English structure in Figure 15. 4 . Non-Indo-European languages of Europe and India We have seen that all the languages now spoken in Europe , with only four exceptions , are each and all descended from the language of our remote ancestors , the Indo-Europeans . One can not help developing respect for those doughty people who , four thousand years after  | being forced from their homeland , are not only still represented in history , but represented over such a wide area and by such noteworthy cultures . More than a billion people have inherited or adopted one or another of the Indo-European-descended languages and these include some of those most advanced in civilization . Surely , our ancestors must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of genius which has continued to reappear in their remotest descendants . The four languages which are indigenous to Europe but not IndoEuropean are Finnish , Estonian , Hungarian and Basque . Since the  | first three belong to the Finno-Ugric family , to which we shall devote a special section , our task here is only to describe Basque and the non-Indo-European languages of India . Basque and the non-Indo-European languages of India . The Basque language is so little known that many well-educated persons have never heard of it ; yet upon inquiry both the language and the people who speak it prove to be quite fascinating . The people call themselves Euskara , which might possibly mean " the left-handed ones " ( Basque esker , Spanish izQuierdo ) . An older form of the name seems to have had the root e-wesk- or e-wask- , whence the Spanish los Vascos ( pronounced Baskos ) and the English name , and the French Gascon ( from Guascon ) . The Basques live on both sides of the French-Spanish border , but the majority are in the Spanish province @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there were estimated to be 750,000 native speakers of the Basque language ( of whom at least 80 per cent are bilingual in Basque and Spanish or French , or both ) , but the nation has had an influence on the Spanish people and on the history of Spain quite out of proportion to its size ? and it used to be much larger . ( Basque place names are found in Spain almost as far south as Madrid , and such well-known Spanish personal names as Mendoza , Vazquez , Vasconcelos , Urrutia , Aguirre , Echeverria are originally Basque . ) Despite many efforts , no connection between the Basque language and any other has ever been proved . The conclusion seems inescapable that it was already there when the Indo-Europeans arrived in Spain ? and place names show that the Basques must have at one time controlled the whole northern half of the country . Basque is , therefore , the sole survivor of the languages spoken in western Europe before the Indo-Europeans entered it . It might well be a descendant of the language spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study of Basque according to the principles and methods of modern scientific linguistics is yet available ; and in its absence , even a summary description of the language can not be made with complete confidence , since in the case of a language of this type , traditional studies invariably obscure the actual structure by persistently interpreting all phenomena of the language either in terms of Greco-Latin " grammar " or of some contemporary Indo-European language .  | Basque is undoubtedly agglutinative ? possibly polysynthetic , but there seem to be genuine words . The formants , however , have great independence ? much more than in an inflecting language . The phonemic system proves to be quite like that of Spanish , which is not surprising when we remember that Basque is the substratum " of Spanish . ( Basque has two . s-phonemes , written " -s " and " -z , " a fact which may underlie Spanish ceceismo . ) It is said that the verbal system has a characteristic tendency to become passive and nominal ( for example , Joanesek etxe bat erosi du , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house one bought is ' ) , but such statements have to be interpreted in the light of the fact that in agglutinative languages , where the same suffixes often attach as easily to what other languages translate as " nouns " as they do to what we would call " verbs , " these two word classes may not be completely distinct from each other . Our count of only four non-Indo-European languages in Europe will not be upset by the Caucasian tongues , spoken largely in the all but inaccessible glens of the Caucasus Mountains , between the Black Sea and the Caspian , between Europe and Asia . They , like Basque , are probably a remnant of the languages spoken in Europe before the arrival of the Indo-Europeans , although attempts to link them with Basque have not been successful . There are a dozen or more , including Abkhaz , Circassian , and others whose speakers have provided Russia with some of that nation 's fiercest cavalrymen . Most of the Caucasian languages are spoken by only a few thousand people ; but one fairly sizable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mingrelian and Laz , which among them count 2,000,000 speakers . ( A particularly famous one was the late Josef Stalin , a Georgian . ) Georgia is undoubtedly the land to which Jason of Greek legend journeyed , and the " Golden Fleece " may have been the product of prehistoric gold mines . These languages appear to be of the inflecting type , and are characterized by clusters of many consonants , including sequences not admitted in most other languages , e.g. , mkv- . Turning now to the situation in India , it seems evident that the Indo-European conquest of that great peninsula extended only to the vicinity of a line drawn from Goa to Hyderabad , and thence to the coast . North of this line ( that is , in Pakistan and the northern half of India ) the indigenous languages ( including such widespread tongues as Gujarati , spoken around Bombay , Bengali , Marathi , Singhalese )  | are all derivatives of the ancient Sanskrit ? with the exception of some isolated enclaves of non-Indo-European speech , and these appear to be of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In lower India and most of Ceylon the many native tongues are nonIndo-European , but they all seem to belong to one family , to which the name Dravidian is given ( from Sanskrit Dravida ) . Noteworthy languages in the Dravidian group are Tamil , Telugu and Malayalam . The languages of this family have not been by any means adequately explored , and very little generalization about them is justified , but it is clear that they are agglutinating in structure and tend to very long words . The island of Ceylon is divided about half and half between Indo-European and Dravidian . Portuguese is , of course , spoken as a colonial language in Goa . A curious derivative of the Indo-European languages of India is the Gypsy language . The details have not been worked out , but the gypsies apparently migrated from India westward during the Middle Ages , and each European nation thought they came from the East ( " Gypsy " is from Egyptian ; the French call them Bohemes , ' Bohemians ' ; the Germans , Italians and Slays call them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be said about Hindustani , which a century ago was considered almost the universal language of India , and now has no official existence . This paradox is explained by the fact that Hindustani was a lingua franca based on a dialect much like most of the descendants of Sanskrit ; l " it was understandable to almost all IndoEuropean speakers in India , but not spoken in what might be called its " classic " form by anyone . Today we find Hindi listed as the official language of India , and Urdu as that of Pakistan . The former is written in the ancient Sanskrit characters ( devanagari ) and the latter in Arabic script ; but it is at first surprising to find that when one hears them spoken , they sound very much alike , and both much like the old Hindustani . The explanation is ( to simplify the situation radically ) that Hindi is Hindustani filled out with borrowings from Sanskrit , while Urdu is Hindustani filled out with borrowings from Persian and Arabic ? conforming to the religious orientation of the two nations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second language for almost all natives of India and Pakistan , because of historical conditions that need not be detailed is so widespread there as to be V ? THE WORLD 'S LANGUAGES : EUROPE AND ASIA  | more universal than any native language . Hence it is essential to the deliberations of government and to the operation of all government services , and will probably continue to be , willy-nilly , an indispensable monument to British involvement in India for many decades to come . Finno-Ugric and Altaic . The remaining European languages which are not Indo-European are Finnish , Estonian , and Hungarian ; these form the group conventionally referred to as Finno-Ugric . They are closely related to each other ? though not mutually comprehensible and may also be related , although much more distantly , to Turkish and the Altaic family of which Turkish is the best-known language . Finnish is , of course , the national language of Finland ( though Swedish is almost equally widespread ) , and we are here considering such languages as Permian , Mordvinian , Livonian , Cheremiss and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extreme north of Sweden and Norway ) as related to dialects of Finnish . We name Estonian as distinct largely because it has been a national language , although Russia has again swallowed up Estonia . Hungarian and Turkish have been thought related somewhat as are Irish and Russian , and there are languages very similar to , and probably ? in many cases certainly ? related to Turkish , strung out from eastern Asia Minor across central Asia as far as the western provinces of China : such languages as Tatar , Kalmuck , Uzbek , Turkoman , Mongol , and Manchu . Many of them are spoken by very small tribes in very inaccessible areas , and are only sketchily known . It is probable that they are the last remnants of that vast westward surge of people whose first impact on Europe caused the break-up of the Indo-Europeans around 2000 B.C. , and which did not subside and come to rest until after the Battle of Lepanto in A.D. 1571 ? a span of almost four thousand years , encompassing the rise and fall of many great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups have the agglutinating structure , and are characterized by " vowel harmony " ; that is , the vowels are regarded as belonging to one of two or three groups ( front , back , neutral ) , and in each word the vowels of the suffixes or postpositions must match the quality of the vowels of the root . Thus , Hungarian often makes the plural with the suffix - vowel + k , the vowel varying with the harmony , so that the plural of hat , house '  | is hdzak ; but the plural of ember , man ' has to be emberek , since the suffix has to have a palatal vowel to join a palatal root . This gives the spoken language a surprising liquidity and melodiousness . Other features common to these languages are an invariable word accent ( in Hungarian and Finnish , always on the first syllable ; in Turkish , always on the last ) , and no forms expressing " gender . " The words are sometimes quite long , due to the accumulation of postpositions , but the vowel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has genuine long vowels and double consonants , whereas in Hungarian the so-called " long " vowels differ in quality from their theoretical short counterparts , and in Turkish there is no such correlation . The languages differ , too , in the number of " cases " ( Finnish is supposed to have fifteen ) , but this is probably largely due to variation in description ; for while languages of this type have no " cases " at all in the sense of Latin or Greek ? they really have as many cases as they have postpositions . Another feature of agglutinating languages is , as we have said , the relative freedom of suffixes : sequences of three or four in one word do not stiffen into standardized " endings , " so new combinations can theoretically be created at any time , and in fact , probably often are . ( As soon as the users of the language restrict themselves to a few standardized combinations , the language is on the way to becoming inflectional . ) This can be illustrated as follows : in Turkish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's ' ; babam is my father , ' so babamin is my father 's ' ; babalar is fathers , ' babalarim my fathers , ' babalarimin of my fathers . ' Theoretically , a root plus any combination of suffixes can in turn be taken as a root to which are applied all the same suffixes or combinations thereof . The agglutinating languages have great resources of expressiveness , and it is estimated that sixty million people speak languages of the Finno-Ugric and Altaic groups . Anyone who seeks to learn the fundamental principles of language should master at least one of this type . 5 . The Sino-Tibetan languages Vast as the continent of Asia is , it is not nearly as congested linguistically as Europe or Africa ( or even the Caucasus ) , for large V ? THE WORLD 'S LANGUAGES : EUROPE AND ASIA  | stretches are sparsely populated , while in the populous areas and they , indeed , are teeming ? a single language-family will encompass an almost incredible number of people . Thus , languages of the SinoTibetan family ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Burmese , and Nepalese ) are spoken by approximately five hundred million people . ( Thai is now often excluded . ) Chinese is a perfect example ? indeed , might be taken as the prototype ? of the analytic type of language structure . It is at the opposite pole from polysynthetic languages ( where no syllable or group of syllables is a word ) in that every syllable is a word ? and conversely , therefore , all words are monosyllabic . Thus , there is no morphology in languages of this type , since there is no principle governing the organization of formants within words : everything is syntax , since it comes under the principle of the organization of words within the sentence . In practice , to be sure , two or more monosyllabic words are often taken together to express a concept for which another language might use one word ( e.g. , hsia wu , 3 bottom noon ' = afternoon ' ; 15 chung ' kuo2 center country ' = " China " ; 16 sometimes one of the words is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' originally this child ' ) ; but although such word groups are common , the separate words remain truly distinct , as in the English phrase " repeat performance " or the French compte rendu . ( Some linguists deny this . ) As a result of this type of structure , some morphemic concepts that seem to us essential play no part in Chinese . Thus , there is naturally neither gender , number nor case . Plurals , for instance , are expressed by a number , or a word meaning many ' : pa ' jen2 = many man ' = men . ' An expression like the man 's house ' would be rendered house this man belong . ' ( It will be noticed that Chinese , literally translated , sounds rather like Pidgin English . This is because Pidgin English is in large measure , English vocabulary with Chinese grammar . ) A verbal expression like he wrote ' is ch'i ' went liao " , i.e. , ( he ) write finish . ' Limiting the word structure to monosyllables results in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese dialects permit no final consonants except -n and - ng . In some dialects only about 400 words are possible . It may well be this which has led to another outstanding feature of the Sino-Tibetan family ? the tones . Each syllable  | may be pronounced in one of four ways ? level , rising , falling-rising , and falling ; a roughly equivalent cadence , it has been suggested , 17 may be heard in English in ( 1 ) ding ( as in ding-dong-bell ) , ( 2 ) what ? ( 3 ) well ? ( 4 ) now ! Thus , shi ' is to lose , ' shit ten , ' shi3 history , ' and shi market . ' This , of course , quadruples the possibilities , but 1,600 to 1,700 words are still not many ( the average speaker of English is estimated to know up to 70,000 ) , 18 and Chinese often has to contend with ambiguities , though of course all concepts get expressed in some way . There are many dialects of Chinese , some with several million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as distinct languages if it were not for the political unity of China . A standard Chinese called kuo2 yu4 ( nation-language ) is gradually becoming widely adopted ; it is based on North Mandarin , the dialect of Peiping , and seems to be suppressing other dialects and to have , or to be acquiring , the necessary prestige to establish itself . The spread of literacy with the standard writing system , Went-Li4 tends to spread the kuo2 yu4 of which it is the expression . But literacy is slow to spread because Went-Li4 is a complicated graphic system ( see Chapter VII ) , and a close transcription ( e.g. , into Roman letters ) would destroy cultural unity . The other languages mentioned above are very much like Chinese . Thai ( Siamese ) has five tones , and Tibetan is in many ways somewhat more archaic than Chinese . The scientific reconstruction of earlier stages of Chinese has a long way yet to go , but the amount of change that has taken place since Marco Polo 's time can be seen in the word tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the thirteenth century , but is ch'a in contemporary Chinese . 6 . Japanese It is often thought that the Japanese and Chinese languages are closely related , but in fact they are not even similar . It is true , however , that cultural relations between the two countries have been close since the fourth century A.D. ; the Japanese have used the Chinese script since then , and many Chinese words have been borrowed into Japanese . But the situation is like that between Persian and Arabic , V . THE WORLD 'S LANGUAGES : EUROPE AND ASIA  | which also are unrelated linguistically despite the fact that Arabic culture has long held a most prominent place in Persian life . So far is Japanese from Chinese , indeed , that in one feature they are exact opposites : Chinese has l but no r , while Japanese has r but no 1 . Actually , this is most probably an oversimplification : each language has a single phoneme ( neither has the 1/r distinction ) which to the American or English ear sounds now as r , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure , or at a stage between analytic and agglutinating . The words are regularly more than one syllable , and the roots appear to be modified by affixes , which , however , are treated ( perhaps under the influence of Chinese ) as separate words ? they are independently stressed ? and yet are not really independent words , for they can not in turn be roots . Thus , uchi ni means " in the house , " hoteru e means " to the hotel . " Consider this sentence : Kono mono wa nani ni tsukaimasu ka ? ( " What is this used for ? " ) Here kono-mono-wa means " This-thing-concerning " ; nanini = " what-for " ; tsukaimasu-ka " use question . " ( We could just as well write konomonowa nanini tsukaimaka . Note that unaccented i and u are frequently dropped out . ) Verbs are distinguished from nouns by a different set of formants which are considered part of the word ? unlike the noun 's postpositions ? but are easily distinguished from it . In the case of verbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polite or honorific situations . This is unique in Japanese and certain other Far Eastern languages , where special provision is made in the basic structure of the language for recognition of the social status of the person addressed . ( Such recognition is made to a greater or less extent in other languages too , of course ? including Indo-European languages ? but usually by style or vocabulary . Nevertheless we do have German duzen and siezen , French tutoyer . ) The Japanese language is easily written in Roman letters and , for English speakers , quite easy to learn if so written . ( In these respects again it is distinct from Chinese . ) The language is spoken as a native tongue by at least a hundred million people , and with remarkable uniformity , for there are no clearly differentiated dialects.7 . Other languages of Asia The language families thus far characterized include all languages spoken in Asia ( excluding Semitic and the Asiatic islands except  | the Japanese ) , with two exceptions . One of these , Korean , has long been assumed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linguistic family is often listed as " Japanese-Korean . " But there are some grounds for suspecting that this assumption , founded mainly on the fact that Japan has for centuries mixed in Korean politics is not valid . ( For an even longer time the country was actually ruled by China . ) Most of the literature about Korean is in Japanese , making it difficult of access in the West . Also , the facts are often disguised by the assumption that Korean is ignorantly spoken Japanese . The phonology of Korean is similar to that of both Japanese and Chinese ? perhaps slightly favoring the latter ? with the noteworthy differences that Korean has both land r , and in final position permits both m and n ( in place names like Panmunjom , for example ) . The structure is less like Chinese ? words appear to be polysyllabic , although naturally much of the vocabularly is borrowed from Japanese ? but it seems to differ in fundamental respects from Japanese also . In any event , it seems to be agglutinating . Korean has a twenty-four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invented specifically for it in the fifteenth century , which is more efficient than either Went-Li or Japanese kana ? at least for writing Korean . More study of Korean is evidently needed , and the same can be said even more emphatically for Ainu , the remaining Asian language ? like Basque one of the world 's most fascinating linguistic mysteries . There are only about 20,000 Ainus . They live in conditions somewhat similar to those of the Indians of the United States , in certain areas on the Japanese islands , and are evidently the remnant of the people who inhabited the island empire before the Japanese came . Anthropologically , they seem to be related to the races of Europe : they certainly do not have the characteristics of the Japanese , Chinese or Manchurian races ; they are fair-skinned and their eyes are not " slanted . " Their language is definitely unrelated to Japanese , but no one has suggested what language family , if any , it is related to . Information on it is too sparse for us to venture a characterization ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " a human being , " strikes us as resembling the word inyu of several American Indian languages with the same meaning.20 The Ainus are spoken of as living in primitive conditions , but " primitive " here may mean merely that , dwelling in remote and unfrequented districts , they preserve ancient customs and social organization quite different from those familiar to us , V THE WORLD 'S LANGUAGES : EUROPE AND ASIA  | and are , of course , unacquainted with modern technology . All sorts of interesting theories could be launched to account for the Ainu , but in the absence of fuller evidence , they would all be equally unfounded . In this chapter we have reviewed , by families , the languages of two continents and of approximately 1,750,000,000 people , of which the Indo-European family includes slightly more than half , say 60 per cent . Here is certainly a vast storehouse of data from which to build a science of language . Individuals who have in hand any significant fraction of these data are , unfortunately , rare indeed . As a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language from outside the Indo-European group , except on the most advanced levels at the largest universities . It would seem a truism that to be a linguist ( scientific or otherwise ) one must first learn to speak many languages . One sees today , however , some evidence of a tendency among some professed linguists and more linguists-to-be to theorize about language without a real grasp or fluent command of more than one or two ( if that many ) besides the native one ; so that native speakers , when available , complain that the theories are founded on forms or principles not actually in use . The student who wishes to become a professional linguist should speak at least two or three languages ( not including his own ) as well , or almost as well as a native , and should acquire this skill before , or at least concomitantly with , his training in linguistics . He should know in this way at least one non-Indo-European language ? preferably one of each of the four basic structural types . These requirements make the road to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too steep , undoubtedly , for a majority of those who might otherwise favor this as a profession . But these requirements , like most ideals , are seldom completely achieved . Anything less , however , risks the great waste of building up a false science of language . As this has already been done once , it is to be hoped it will not be done again .  | THE WORLD 'S LANGUAGES : AFRICA , THE PACIFIC , THE AMERICAS We now turn to the languages of other continents and archipelagoes . In the two continents so far considered , relatively few languages are spoken by very large numbers of people ; in the areas now to be reviewed , the opposite is true ? each of a large number of distinct languages is , with some exceptions , spoken by a small , sometimes a very small community . The first linguistic family which we shall examine is of prime importance , not only from the linguistic point of view , but also for historical , archeological , religious and many other considerations . There are records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B.C. , and Western culture and civilization unquestionably originated among the peoples of whose culture these ancient languages were the vehicle . 1 . The Semitic languages At the time of the oldest existing records , we find the earliest known representatives of this family spoken at the eastern end of the Mediterranean , south of Asia Minor and westward into northern Africa . From before the beginning of recorded history the Semitic peoples inhabited the Arabian desert , and from time to time one or more of these tribes would make their way into the fertile plains at the desert 's edge and there settle down to an agricultural life , abandoning their original nomadic culture . Thus , beginning about 3000 B.C. , the Hebrews started to move into the land of Canaan ( essentially modern Palestine ) ; the Akkadians moved into the plain of Shinar , inhab- ited by the Sumerians , and founded the city of Babylon ; and the Assyrians , further north along the Tigris , occupied the upland of Assur ( where they were often harried by the Hittites ) . Already at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and between Egypt and Sumeria there was regular communication ? no doubt over wellmarked caravan routes , which may in themselves have attracted Semitic desert raiders . When the Akkadians adopted the cuneiform writing of the Sumerians , the first known records were made in a Semitic language ? using the term " Semitic " in the narrower sense , with reference only to the languages of the tribes of the Arabian desert . ( The latest researches suggest that to consider Egyptian and the related languages of northern Africa a distinct subgroup , more closely related to each other than to the Semitic languages , is to perpetuate an unjustified geographical classification ; according to this view , some other term , such as " Afro-Asiatic , " should be found to designate all the languages , without subgroups . ) But it was certainly not much later that the Old Semitic syllabic script was originated , probably from the Egyptian writing ( see Chapter VII , 5 ) , and was first put into use by the Phoenicians , northerly cousins of the Hebrews and inhabitants of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medieval history , different peoples of the Semitic stock succeeded each other in playing major roles in the development of civilization in the " cradle of Western culture . " The Phoenicians traded all over the Mediterranean , and founded Carthage , the nation on the site of contemporary Tunisia which was the early rival of Rome . The Arameans , about 1500 B.C. , emerged from the desert and occupied Syria ( until recently merged with Egypt as the United Arab Republic ) , where they founded the storied city of Damascus . Their language , Aramaic , eventually displaced many other Semitic dialects and became the general language in the region between the Mediterranean shore and the desert , between Egypt and central Asia Minor . By the time of Christ , even Hebrew had yielded to Aramaic , and it was that language which Christ and his disciples spoke . ' In later times , Aramaic developed into Syriac , and sacred literature in Syriac is still preserved ; but Syriac itself ultimately gave way to Arabic . On the Persian Gulf , the Chaldaeans overran the Assyrians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tion of the Indo-Europeans was taking place , so that even as the Assyrian empire fell ( seventh century B.C. ) , the Persian empire was rising to dominance in Asia Minor . What we may regard as the last of these waves of Semitic people washing in from the desert and displacing their predecessors was begun with the foundation of the Mohammedan religion in 622 A.D. , and the subsequent spread of Islam and the Arabian people , language and culture all over the southern Mediterranean and even into Spain and Portugal . At the present time , Arabic is the chief Semitic language ( with widely varying dialects , ranging from very archaic to what , but for tradition , might be called new languages developed from classical Arabic ) ; but Hebrew has apparently been successfully revived in Israel ? though Israeli Hebrew , too , is something quite different from that spoken in ancient times . Besides the languages so far named , we must also mention the dialects of southern Arabia , and four languages spoken in Ethiopia ? Tigre and Tigrina , Amharic ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liturgical language . The phonology of the Semitic languages is quite a bit different from the familiar phonemic systems of the Indo-European group : it includes several phonemes ? especially in the guttural category ? which are unknown in European languages , and systems of correlations are found which are unknown or at least rare in the mare familiar tongues . As regards structure , the Semitic languages exhibit a curious dualism . Striking , and with only distant analogies in other languages , is the feature of consonantal triliteral roots conveying the message information , and arrangements of the vowels interspersed in this framework conveying the structural information , resulting in what might be called two-dimensional-words ' ( for more data , see Chapter VII , 4 ) . This type of structure is found more predominantly in the Semitic verb ( cf. Arabic sdf , he saw , ' yisuf , he is seeing , ' say if seeing , ' sof , the seeing ' ) , but it can also be found in nouns in the so-called " broken plurals " ( cf. kitab , book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banat ) . On the other hand , this structure comprises only about half , or less than half , of the grammar of a Semitic language ; the other half seems to fall into the familiar and conventional inflectional category //  | ( cf. torobeza , table , ' torobezeit , tables , ' torobezen , two tables ' ) . The verb shows signs of nominal character ; the " person endings " are the same as the possessive suffixes of the noun . The comparative study of Semitic languages ( as , indeed , of all language families other than Indo-European ) is still in its infancy : perhaps when it has developed further we shall be able to reconcile these two structural principles in one inclusive view . 2 . The " Hamitic " languages Turning to the so-called " Hamitic " subgroup , the first and most important language is , of course , ancient Egyptian . Records were made in this language almost 3,000 years before the birth of Christ ? but as the script was syllabic , and no living language of today is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vowel-phonemes or vocalic system ; one school of Egyptologists ( e.g. , Petrie ) simply substitutes an e for every unknown vowel , and would transcribe a name as , e.g. , Akhenaten , while another ( e.g. , Breasted ) follows Coptic and would render the same name as Ikhnaton . This lack of knowledge hampers us in forming an idea of the language ; no one has attempted a phonemic description of ancient Egyptian , but it seems clear that its basic structure is similar to that of Arabic and Hebrew . The very age of the records in this language may work to conceal the basic relationship between it and Semitic as we know the latter ; for in effect we have to compare Egyptian of 2500 B.C. with Arabic of more than two thousand years later . Linguistic development in that interval might well have obscured a relationship originally much more evident . The Coptic language , spoken in Egypt and Ethiopia down to the sixteenth century , was the descendant of ancient Egyptian ( the name probably preserves the native name of the Egyptian language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " heka Ptah ) and , although no longer a living language , is still used ( like Latin in Europe ) as a liturgical language of Ethiopian Christians . The next main component of the " Hamitic " group is the various languages spoken widely over northern Africa by the Berbers and Tuaregs , the wandering tribes of the Sahara desert : such languages as Cabyle and Shilkh come under this heading , but they , like so many languages of Africa , have been imperfectly investigated .  | Arabic and Berber ? with , of course , a slight overlay of the languages of colonizing countries , such as Spanish , French and Italian ? account for the speech of all of the upper third of Africa , north of a line drawn from Senegal on the Atlantic coast to Eritrea on the Red Sea . In Ethiopia , as we have seen , Hamito-Semitic languages are spoken , and also in the Somalilands ; the languages of these latter regions Somali , Galla and Beja ? have been regarded as a special subgroup of Hamito-Semitic , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Last in this family is a group of languages spoken south of our line , in Nigeria and around Lake Chad . Noteworthy among the Chad languages is Haussa , rather widely used as a trade language . 3 . Central and southern African languages While it is not geographically accurate , for our present purposes we shall define " central Africa " as that part of the Dark Continent between one line drawn from Senegal to Eritrea ( about 14 ? north latitude ) , and another drawn from the Atlantic coast along the southern border of Angola to the Mozambique strait ( at about 16 ? south latitude ) . This will include Ghana , Liberia , Nigeria , the Congo , Kenya , Uganda , Rhodesia and Tanganyika . This is the region of equatorial forest , primitive tribes , and exotic wild life of elephants , pygmies , gorillas , headhunters and cannibals . Over this whole area , the so-called Niger-Congo language family is dominant which is a way of saying that there seems to be enough evidence to justify the conclusion that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single family , which we label the Niger-Congo family . The languages of Sierra Leone , Senegal , Liberia , Ghana , coastal Nigeria , and the Cameroons come under this heading . The largest subgroup of the Niger-Congo family is the Bantu languages , including Swahili in the Congo and in eastern Africa , Kikuyu in Kenya , and Zulu in South Africa . Excluding the Niger-Congo family , there remain in central Africa only ( 1 ) a few languages here and there which are either undescribed or which can not be proved related to any other , and ( 2 ) one other group ? the Upper Nile group , spoken along the headwaters of the Nile in the Sudan , and also extending westward into what was VI ? THE WORLD 'S LANGUAGES : AFRICA , PACIFIC , AMERICAS  | formerly French Equatorial Africa and southeastward into Uganda , Kenya and Tanganyika . This group includes the Masai and Nuba languages . The remainder of the African continent can be covered in a brief compass . Here European colonization has gone on for a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , later English ? have become well established , as the languages of as much as a third of the population and as the official languages of the governments of the Cape colonies . As regards the native African languages in these nations , it seems that in relatively recent times tribes of the Bantu speech overran an earlier stock represented by Hottentot and Bushman in South Africa , by Hatsa and Sandawe in Tanganyika . These four appear to be related and have been called the Khoisan group . Several Indo-European languages of northern India are rather widely spoken in Africa , due to migration . As to the structure of the languages of Africa , the " Hamitic " languages are , as has been stated , similar to the Semitic . About the vast Niger-Congo group it is difficult to make statements which will be both substantially true of all the various languages , and not so sweepingly general as to be of little practical use . It can be said , however , that these languages frequently feature phonemes which are unknown or excessively rare in both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mboya , Ngayo , ba-Ntu ) and implosive sounds , or " clicks " 2 ; in addition , many of them are tone languages ( cf. Chapter V , 4 ) . The majority would appear to be either agglutinative or polysynthetic ; but as may be imagined , considering that a really accurate description of a language can only be given by someone who speaks it fluently , our descriptive data for most African languages is none too reliable . Here is another of the many vast untilled fields which linguistic science offers to the ambitious young scholar . Geographically , the island of Madagascar ( now , officially , the Malagasy Republic ) would presumably be regarded as part of Africa . Linguistically , however , something peculiar has happened : the languages spoken on the island do not belong to any of the African linguistic families , or even to those of India : they are members of a group whose nearest representative is Malayan , thousands of miles away in the Malay peninsula . Herein lies , certainly , the re- suit of some highly significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any written record . ( In the study of linguistics one often finds evidence of historical events unknown to the science of history , which is so often derived exclusively from written documents in the writer 's own language . ) We can not here pursue the historical or anthropological implications , and must simply take the facts as they are and consider Madagascar under our next heading . 4 . The Malayo-Polynesian languages Probably no family of languages is spoken as original ( i.e. , not " superimposed " ) over a wider area than that which now comes under our consideration . From the island of Madagascar , as we have seen , to the Malay peninsula ( that tail of Asia with Singapore at its tip ) , to the East Indies and thence across the vast Pacific to Hawaii , this group of languages prevails over an area stretching more than halfway around the world . The point along this great circumference at which the family originated is very hard to identify . Although Heyerdahl proved that the Pacific islands could have been settled from South America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were , for no languages of the Malayo-Polynesian family have been shown ever to have existed in South America , while they seem to be of very ancient lineage in Malaya ; hence the people who speak these languages would seem to have spread eastward from there , and westward to Madagascar . As indicated in the name , the family may be broken into two subgroups : ( 1 ) Malayan , in the Malacca peninsula itself and in Madagascar and the East Indies ( including Malay , strictly so called ; Atankara , Hova and Sakalava in Madagascar ; many Philippine languages , including Tagalog , Visayan and Igorot ; Javanese ; the indigenous language of Formosa ; and the languages of Borneo , the Celebes , Sumatra , and the Moluccas ) ; and ( 2 ) Polynesian , comprising the languages of the Pacific islands except for New Guinea , Australia and Tasmania , and including such languages as Maori , Fiji , Yapese , Samoan , and Hawaiian . The first of these subgroups ? the languages more like Malay VI . THE WORLD 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie structurally in the analytic column , with perhaps traces of an earlier inflective character . ( Only in Javanese are there records of these languages older than a century or so . ) Words are almost always disyllabic , and these two-syllable words appear to be derived from monosyllables . The phonemic system is fairly varied , and many true prefixes and suffixes are used , generally with a 1:1 morpheme-formant ratio ; in the absence of these prefixes and suffixes the root , as in English or Chinese , is all message-material and not determined as to function , so that it is reported of these languages that they " do not distinguish the parts of speech ' from one another . " The existence of a system of classifiers ( e.g. , buda dua orang two children ' = childtwo-person , ' kuda dua ikor two horses ' = horse-two-tail ' ) may be a further development of native analytical tendencies , or possibly due to Sino-Tibetan influence . ( Influences on speakers of these languages may be thought of as from Sanskrit in regard to literature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culturally . ) Three Malay expressions have gained some general currency in English ; orang utan which means man of the forest ' or wild being ' ; mata hari which means eye of day ' or sun ' ; and salong , a borrowing from the Mohammedan greeting salaam , which became ( through British Army slang ) our expression so long . ' The languages more like Maori , Tahitian or Hawaiian are distinguished by their very limited inventory of phonemes and syllable types ? it may be said that , in general , a syllable can consist only of consonant + vowel . As there seems to be a tendency to dispense with most consonants , there are very many homonyms , and the languages have a very " liquid " sound , with many vowel sequences . Hawaiian is no doubt the most familiar to Americans , and certain words and phrases ( e.g. , aloha oe , " hail " or " farewell to you , " poi-poi " to eat " or " food " ) are heard fairly often . 5 . Other languages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , it does not embrace all the languages spoken in the Pacific . An important exception is the native languages of Australia , of which there are more than a hundred , notably Bushman . They have been divided into a northern and a southern group , between which some see a relationship , others  | none . The fact is , however , that not enough is known about them to make any sensible or reasonable surmise about their genetic relationships or structure . The populations speaking these languages are excessively small and gradually declining into extinction , and they are located in almost totally inaccessible areas . The same is true of certain other language groups which may be mentioned here . The indigenous languages of New Guinea , Halmahera , Bougainville and some of the Solomon Islands have been thought to be related , and the group has been named Papuan . All that is really known about these languages , however , is that they are neither Polynesian nor Indo-European . The native languages of Tasmania are now extinct , and therefore do not concern us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese nor Indian , but is usually thought of as belonging to a group ( called Mon-Khmer or Austroasiatic ) which also has representatives in eastern India ( notably Munda ) and elsewhere in the Malacca peninsula ? in Burma , Tonkin , Cambodia , Annam , and Siam . Though profoundly influenced by Sino-Tibetan , these languages retain their own identity . They seem to have been originally agglutinating ; but most have now become more or less analytic ? no doubt under the influence just mentioned . Vietnamese is , of course , spoken by a large population . The Nicobar and Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal have their own languages , though Nicobarese appears to be related to the Mon-Khmer languages . And Burushaski exists in solitary isolation in the northwest of India , quite surrounded by other languages none of which are related to it . From this brief section it will be clear that any scholar whose tastes run to field work ? who wishes to be among those who unearth the original data on which the whole structure of his science is built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of original investigation . Indeed , the whole comparative branch of linguistics could undoubtedly stand rewriting , if the necessary data could be assembled . The American Indian languages Of all the languages in the world , probably none is structurally more different from the familiar languages of Europe than those of  | the American Indians . The Indian languages are therefore among the most valuable for the linguist to study ? and it is not difficult to obtain abundant accurate information about them , for the majority are still living languages ; nor need one even travel unduly far to come into personal contact with native speakers , since at least a few members of the race still live in almost every state of the Union . Despite all this , however , and despite the fact that European races have been in contact with the Indians for five centuries , and many languages ( even in North America ) have been recorded in written documents for more than two hundred years ? despite all this , the study of Indian languages made no impact on linguistic science until after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , probably , to two factors . First was the assumption ? so long unchallenged ? that the " science of grammar " as left by Donatus was the ultimate truth about the nature of language and its operations , so that every newly encountered language was reported in the terms prescribed by traditional grammar , and wound up seeming to be substantially a dialect of Latin ? this in turn being taken as further proof of the formula 's universal truth . Second , the Indians were generally looked upon with the hatred and contempt which we reserve for those we really fear , so that anything unique about their language which could not be disguised could be dismissed as the result of their ignorance , stupidity and barbarism . When linguists and anthropologists at last began to investigate the Indian languages thoroughly , the study at once greatly enlarged linguistic horizons . All the Indian languages are polysynthetic ( a term which has already been explained ' ) . Thus , they do not have word classes or " parts of speech " ; most , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is or can be a sentence . They do not have declensions and conjugations : the sentence is not made up of a " noun " in the " nominative , " a " verb " in the " indicative , " and a " noun " in the " accusative " ? although prior to 1900 many of the learned would have assured us that no language could operate without these " essential " elements , and any expression that did not contain them was gibberish . ( They would readily have agreed that Shoshone and Chippewa were in fact gibberish , expressing only as much sense as Indians were capable of. )  | The Indian languages were at first regarded as a bewildering welter of unrelated idioms ( as late as 1939 Gray could write " to give any general characterisation of them is quite impossible " 5 ) , and were categorized on a purely geographical basis . Within the last twenty years , however , great strides have been made in the study of Indian languages , and the picture has greatly changed . ' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one great obstacle , ' but in 1928 Leonard Bloomfield made a pioneer demonstration of the application of the methods of comparative linguistics in such cases , ' and now the North American languages , at least , have been seen to fall into less than a dozen families ? perhaps fewer , when the study has progressed further . It is , incidentally , conventional to describe the geographical distribution of American Indian languages more or less as of the time when Europeans first arrived on this continent ( i.e. , ca. 1500 ) , since so many of them have since become extinct or have shifted to very distant regions , ' and besides , as of today all are merely substrata to Indo-European languages ? English , Spanish , Portuguese , and French . On this basis it appears that in the seventeenth century , when the first English-speaking colonies were established in the New World , the entire northeastern quarter of the continent ? with two exceptions to be mentioned presently ? spoke languages belonging to one great family , the Algonkian . To this family belonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Powhatan , Delaware , Mohegan , Massachusetts , Passamaquoddy , Penobscot , and Micmac . ( The names suggest their approximate locations . ) This vast family prevailed not only from northern Virginia to Labrador and Hudson 's Bay , but westward as far as the Rockies , including such languages as Cree , Chippewa ( called Ojibwa in Canada ) , Menomini , Potawotomi , Fox , Illinois , Shawnee , Arapaho , Blackfoot , and Cheyenne . The domain of Algonkian was interrupted by two enclaves : Iroquoian , in New York State and adjacent areas ; and Siouan , mainly located in the central Great Plains west of the Mississippi . Most of the Plains Indians were Siouan speakers : Sioux itself , Crow , and the languages spoken in what are now the Dakotas , Iowa , Missouri , Nebraska , Kansas , Arkansas , and northern Oklahoma , but with an enclave in the Southeast constituted by Catawba , Biloxi and Ofo . VI ' THE WORLD 'S LANGUAGES : AFRICA , PACIFIC , AMERICAS  | The remainder of what are now the Southern states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Choctaw , Alabama , Creek , Natchez and Muskogee languages . Algonkian is undoubtedly the first in importance of the Indianlanguage families , in the sense that it includes the greatest number of languages and covers the widest area . On that basis , Athabaskan would take second rank . This family embraces all the Indian languages of Alaska and Canada north and west of the Algonkian , with the exception of the Mosan languages of British Columbia and certain adjacent areas , and the belt of Eskimo-Aleut which stretches across the continent north of all the others and , for the most part , above the Arctic Circle . But although Athabaskan belongs primarily to northwestern Canada , there is a remarkable enclave of this family in the Southwest ( mainly Arizona and New Mexico , with parts of Oklahoma and Texas ) : the chief languages of this group are Apache and Navaho . This intrusive Athabaskan enclave is surrounded by languages akin to the Indian tongues of northern Mexico , which , with Hopi , Paiute , Shoshone and Comanche , form a large language family called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Half of Arizona today is Indian country , and of that about half speaks Navaho , an Athabaskan language , and the other half Hopi , which is Uto-Aztecan . The Athabaskans were definitely felt as intruders in the Uto-Aztecan territory , which in part explains the bad reputation of the Apaches . The Mexican members of the Uto-Aztecan family include Pima , Papago and  --  most illustrious of all ? Nahuatl , the language of the Aztecs ; many are not aware that this is still a living language , spoken in various parts of Mexico . Characteristic of the Aztec language was a lateralized dental appearing in words like chocolatl , coyotl , Nahuatl , and the common Mexican Spanish word tlapaleria , " hardware store . " The Indian languages of the West Coast seem to fall into two families : Penutian in Oregon and California ( including Chinook , once the basis of a trade language ) , and Hokan in the rest of California and Lower California , including Shasta , Yana , Yuma and , in Mexico and northern Nicaragua , Tlapanec and Jicaque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be nearly  | as detailed , since much less investigation has been carried on . Beyond the Mexican Indian languages already mentioned , we may cite Mayan , also still living in southern Mexico , Guatemala and Honduras . Of the many languages of the Mayan family , modern Yucatec is probably most like the language of the Mayan civilization at its height . Areas of Mexico and Central America not so far mentioned were , at the time of the Conquest , inhabited by speakers of languages about which little has as yet been ascertained  --  languages such as Zoque , Zapotec , Mixtec and Tarascan . However , more is being learned about these languages almost daily . " In the southern hemisphere the picture is even sketchier . Besides the Indo-European Spanish and Portuguese , we have to note Quechua , the language of the Inca empire ? also still living and spoken by several million people in Peru , Ecuador and Bolivia ? and Guarani of Paraguay and southern Brazil . The word " hurricane " is believed to be from Guarani . Beyond this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few remaining unexplored areas in the world , several are in South America ; and often where descriptions of language are available , little reliance can be placed on them ( Grigorieff 's grammar of Quechua , " for example , is essentially a translation into Quechua of the Royal Spanish Academy grammar of Spanish ) . Still , enough evidence is at hand to support a surmise that the South American Indian languages are of a structure similar to that of the North American ones , and that there is a possibility of some day proving all of them to be related . Indian languages often operate with a very restricted inventory of phonemes , yet this does not lead to extensive homonymy , as in Sino-Tibetan or Polynesian , because while a limited number of phonemes and allowable clusters greatly restricts the number of possible words that can be formed , polysynthetic languages in effect form sentences directly out of formants ; and since the formants may be less than a syllable , and any grouping is possible and may be combined in a " sentence word " with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sentence words " is quite large . The student may well feel a little disappointed that , after listing as a topic " a survey of the languages of the world , " linguistic science turns out to be able to give so little information about so many of them . This will serve to emphasize a fact we have not neglected to VI ? THE WORLD 'S LANGUAGES : AFRICA , PACIFIC , AMERICAS  | stress ? that there is a tremendous amount of work to do in linguistics , and that the science would fill in the gaps faster if it could triple or quadruple the number of its recruits . All that a conscientious survey of the languages of the world can do at the present moment is to report the data available to date . No one will be happier than the writer to soon find that the outline given in these two chapters has become obsolete and needs complete revision .  | LANGUAGES AND WRITING It has been said that the two oldest and greatest inventions of man were the wheel and the art of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one wished to make a group of three , surely the development of writing must claim the third place . Without a system of writing , no matter how wise or sublime the thought , once uttered it is gone forever ( in its original form , at least ) as soon as its echoes have died away . Indeed , it would seem that without a means of preserving wisdom and culture , civilization , which depends on the passing on of a heritage from generation to generation , could not develop . The facts , however , are otherwise : noteworthy civilizations have arisen and flourished without possession of any form of writing , usually by forming a class of society whose duty and profession it was to keep in memory what we write down in books ( and , too often , subsequently forget ) . Even the average citizen in such a society took as a matter of course demands upon his memory which we today would consider beyond human capacity . All the same , one may question whether a really complex civilization ? one capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported by such a system . If there ever was one , we may be sure it has been grossly slighted by history ? which , after all , depends almost entirely on written records . Who , for example , has ever heard the Gaulish version of Caesar 's campaigns ? 1 . Ideographic " writing " There seems to be no reason to doubt that the many systems of writing which have been developed at different times by various peoples VII ? LANGUAGES AND WRITING Figure during mankind 's long history all grew , by steps which we can and shall trace , out of man 's ability to draw pictures . Suppose you wish to preserve a record of your catching a twentypound trout , but happen to be illiterate . The obvious thing to do would be to draw and hang a picture of yourself catching the big fish . It was , apparently , an equally obvious thing to do some fifty thousand years ago , for the caves which yielded us the remains of the CroMagnon man first attracted attention because of their beautifully drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals ( Fig. 16 ) . We shall never know whether this was a mere decoration or a record . Given the ability to draw well enough so that your representations of persons and objects can be readily recognized , it is , of course , not difficult to tell a complete story in one panoramic picture , or in a series of uncaptioned sketches . The range of information that can be conveyed in this way can be greatly extended if a few simple conventions are agreed upon between the artist and his prospective audience : the use of a totem-sign for a certain tribe ; considering a prone man to be sick or wounded if his eyes are open , dead if they are closed , and so on . Several tribes of North American Indians made use of this kind of communication ( Fig. 17 ) .  | In these circumstances , it will be noted , pictures act as a means for the communication of thought , and thus are somewhat like a language in themselves . Indeed , some authorities include this kind of communication among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberately excluded it from our definition . It is common and conventional to call this kind of writing ideographic writing , and while the term is convenient , this is properly in no sense either language or writing , as we shall proceed to show . Note , first , that the kind of communication achieved in Figure 16 is totally independent of the language or languages of the persons who make the drawing and of those who read it . The " text " may be correctly " read " in any language . It is not an effort to record the language in which the event is described , but , like language itself , to record the original events : we might even say it is a system alternative to language for symbolizing events . And therefore it is not strictly writing ; for writing is always a record or representation of language . Ideographic " writing " can not be strictly language either , for it has two limitations which would make it unworkable as a system for expressing human thought . First , it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent for drawing . This , however , could be offset by conventionalizing the characters to a few simple strokes , not immediately recognizable as the original picture except by previous knowledge of the convention ( see Fig. 18 ) . But then the second , more serious objection still remains : even with such conventionalization , the system can not adequately express the whole range of human thought ; and to do so even partially will require thousands of characters and a system of such complexity that exceedingly few in the society could master it . The Chinese people have an ancient and beautiful script which was originally , and still is largely , ideographic . The characters have been conventionalized , but it is still quite easy to recognize their origin , as was shown in Figure 18 . Although there are many mutually unintelligible dialects of Chinese , the same written text can be read by any native ( each in his own dialect ) , and the gist can even be made out by one who knows the principles of the system , but little of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces toward Chinese cultural unity , and for this reason the Chinese will probably never substitute another writing for it . But it is estimated that 70,000   Figure to 125,000 characters exist ( not all , of course , used with equal frequency ) , and it is said that a scholar takes seven years to learn to read and write Chinese if he already speaks it , while over 80 per cent of the native speakers of Chinese are illiterate in their own language . Where there is considerable divergence between a language and its written representation , as in the case of Chinese or Italian , where many different dialects are written with the same spelling , or in French or English , where the language has changed considerably since the stage for which the writing was devised , a tendency may arise to consider the written language the " correct " language , of which the spoken language is a deformation which should be " corrected " to agree with the writing . This is particularly true when the writing either records , or once recorded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class of society which enjoys prestige , to which many native speakers would like to assimilate themselves . This , however , always obscures things and puts the cart before the horse . Actually , the prestige class of any society probably least conforms its speech consciously to writing : sure of their status , its members do not worry about betraying an inferior origin in speech or behavior . It is said that if a man 's table manners are absolutely disgusting , he is either a peasant or a duke . Writing is , in its essence , nothing but a means of recording language with some degree of efficiency . Whether one form or another of the language is " good " or " correct " is an entirely different question ; a system of writing is good or bad according as it records , accurately or otherwise , whatever form of the language it is aiming to record .  | However , because of the prestige of letters in largely illiterate populations ( which is so great that gramarye has even been thought to have magic power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to written forms has been so strong as to lead to such things as the creation of a word like " misle " from a misreading of the word " misled . " ' Many similar examples could be given . 2 . Pictographic writing Any nation which finds occasion to use a form of ideographic writing with any regularity , even if all the writing is the job of one relatively small social group , will probably sooner or later take the simple and logical step to pictographic writing . In this case , the written sign , which in ideographic writing is the symbol for an idea , becomes the symbol of a word . For example , a device like , which represents the floor-plan of a house , now becomes a sign for per , the Egyptian word for " house , " or of beyt , the Hebrew word for " house . " Another example : the picture , conventionalized to , which of course represented the snout of an ox , now becomes a sign for ? alep , the ancient Hebrew word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the improvement of communication are evident . The written sign now symbolizes , not an idea , but a word , and a word is a far more precise symbol of a mental concept than any other which can be devised . With a sufficient stock of symbols of this new type , the writer can distinguish among a house , a stable , a barn , a shed , and a palace ; whereas with ideographic writing he is pretty well limited to " house " vs. " big house " or " small house " ( as there is no separate symbol for the adjective , the bigness or smallness can not be specified and can range from " largish " to " enormous " ) . Much ambiguity is avoided : if you have tried to convey messages ideographically ? or by " sign language , " which is an acted-out version of the same thing ? you know how easy it is for an intended message " the king is angry " to be interpreted " the old man is sick . " Pictographic writing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of recording language , not just an alternative way of expressing the concepts which language expresses . VII ' LANGUAGES AND WRITING  | All pictographic writing systems that we know have developed from ideographic systems , and show clear traces of this , notably in their tendency to preserve ideographic symbols among the pictographic . Thus , the ancient Egyptians had an ideograph for water , a representation of waves or ripples : Eventually they derived from this a sign wvw. , standing for the word mu , which meant " water . " But they often wrote the word mu as follows And in writing of a river , the word for which was they also added the water sign : atur was written The purpose of these ideographic " determinants " was probably to help the reader who did not know the particular word or sign by giving an indication of its general connotation . Nouns denoting persons were usually given the " determinant " of a little man ? ? or a little woman ? . For , despite the noteworthy increase in efficiency which pictographic writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one advantage of the ideographic system has been lost ? the characters are no longer self-explanatory . ( This is only a theoretical advantage on behalf of ideographic script , since , while the ideographic character for a bird should presumably be readily recognized as a bird , in practice the characters have to be conventionalized for the sake of those who do not draw well . ) A considerable number of pictographic writing systems have been developed at different times in different parts of the world , but , Sunday-supplement science to the contrary notwithstanding , quite independently of one another , so that we have no ground for talking about the " evolution " by man of the art of writing . There is no evidence whatever for a First Cave Man who sat with hammer and chisel and stone and figured out how to chisel the first message , after which man made improvement after improvement , until the peak ( represented , of course , by English orthography of the present day ) was reached . Actually , nations once literate have been known to lapse into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | The step from pictographic to syllabic writing is an easy , logical and , it might very well seem , self-evident one ; yet there have been several nations which developed the first without ever proceeding to the second . It would probably be safe to say , however , that a majority of those who came as far as pictographic writing took the step to syllabic script . In pictographic writing it is , of course , as easy to develop a stock of thousands of characters as in ideographic ; yet , strange as it might seem , there is still always a shortage . This shortage arises because it is either extremely difficult or impossible to represent some words in pictures . Take " velocity , " for example . Is there any picture you could draw to express this that might not be read as , say , " the man is running " ? Or , if you think you could picture " velocity , " how would you handle " acceleration " ? If you still think you could manage this one , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word " the " ? The first step toward syllabic writing is taken when you permit yourself to cheat a little and take advantage of homophones . There is , let us say , a good pictograph for " the Sea " ; you use it to express the Holy " See , " or " I see " ( writing , perhaps , the characters for eye and sea ) . When you have expressed the word " icy " by the characters for eye and sea , or belief by the characters for bee and leaf you have turned the corner to syllabic writing . Any relationship whatever between the character and the meaning of the syllable it stands for is henceforth entirely irrelevant . The character expresses nothing but a sequence of sounds ? the sounds making up one of the syllables of the language . The first result of this is a gain of efficiency : a decrease in the number of possible characters ( since more than one word or syllable can be written with the same syllabic character ? in fact a great number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather small number of characters ) . This gain is largely theoretical , however , for there will still be several thousand characters . The superiority of syllabic writing over pictographic from the point of view of efficiency will largely depend on the structure of syllables in the language using it . If syllables are generally or always simple in structure , a syllabic system of writing may work extremely well . VII ? LANGUAGES AND WRITING  | In every type of language , however , ambiguity and duplication are likely to be discovered in this kind of unlimited syllabic writing . It is often uncertain which of various homonymous readings is intended ( e.g. , does a character for " deep " joined to one for " end " mean " deep end " or " depend " ? ) . And conversely , there are almost always two or more ways to say the same thing . If the users of a syllabic system have a sense of logic , they will soon tend to adopt the practice of always writing the same syllable with the same character . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reduce the number of signs to manageable proportions : the sequence baba will always be expressed by signs expressing BA BAnever by signs for syllables such as BAB HA , BA ABA , ' B AB HA . Hence the number of signs is not so great as not to be within the capacity of the more or less average memory . Since many languages have only one syllable-type ? CV ( i.e. , consonant followed by vowel ) ? application of the principle above to the syllabic writing of such a language results in a very simple , logical and efficient system , next to alphabetic writing the most efficient writing possible . The simplicity and efficiency are likely to prove elusive , however , when applied to languages of more complex syllabic structure . Even so , one almost inevitably arrives at the idea of having a series of signs representing syllables in which each consonant of the language is paired with each vowel : BA , BE , BI , BO , BU ; DA , DE , DI , DO , DU ; FA , FE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A list of such signs is called a syllabary . Some time after this stage of limited syllabic writing has been reached , the thought may occur that the inventory of signs can be further reduced by taking one form , without any specification , as the form for , say , BA ; and then simply using diacritic marks to indicate the other possible syllable structures : something like the following : This brings us very close to alphabetic writing . The last step in syllabic writing and the first in alphabetic writing might come about by accident ; suppose a class of words ends in a syllable - ba , and in the course of time the vowel ceases to be pronounced . Now the syllabic sign A stands for B alone , not BA ; and some sign ( in Sanskrit  | virdma , in Arabic sukun ) is invented to express this situation : e.g. , A will express BA , and A will express B. By use of this sign the vowel of any syllabic sign can be suppressed , and any sign in the syllabary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described is seen in the Semitic writing systems ( Arabic , Hebrew ) , of which it is often said that they " write only the consonants . " Actually , all the Arabic and Hebrew letters were originally syllabic signs , representing the consonant and a vowel ( see Fig. 19 ) . 4 . Alphabetic writing As will be clear by now , true alphabetic writing consists in having a sign for each sound ( technically each phoneme ) of the language , rather than one for each word or one for each syllable . This is the most efficient writing system possible , since a language will be found to have some thousands of words and at least a couple of hundred different syllables , but the words and syllables are made up of individual speech sounds which seldom exceed sixty to seventy in number , and sometimes number as few as a dozen . Hence an alphabetic writing system can , with the fewest possible units ( a number easily within anyone 's ability to master ) , record every possible utterance in the language . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from drawing pictures to ideographs , to pictographic and syllabic writing , so logically follow each other as inevitably to lead a nation or tribe from one to the next until ultimately an alphabetic writing would be achieved . But such is simply not the case . Many great nations , for example the Japanese , have come as far as syllabic writing , and never seemed to feel a need to go beyond it . Indeed , in all the history of mankind , alphabetic writing has been invented only once , and all the alphabets in the world that are truly so called are derived from that single original alphabet . It seems likely that but for a certain lucky linguistic accident , man would never have discovered the alphabetic principle of writing . Had that been the case , the history of mankind would certainly have been very , very different . There is a strong probability that it was the ancient Egyptians who first hit on the alphabetic principle ; but we can not prove it , for we  | can not show that all or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know were used in Egyptian texts of any period ( though an apparently sound pedigree can be made for a few of them ) . Of course , the hieroglyphic writing had a stock of thousands of characters , and might well have included the ones we are looking for in texts which have disappeared or not yet been discovered . What is harder to explain , however , is that when the Egyptians wrote alphabetically , they gave alphabetic values to an entirely different set of characters ( Fig. 20 ) . Yet the Egyptians had been using a writing system for literally thousands of years , and had gone through all the stages . It does not seem likely that some other nation came along just as the Egyptians were on the point of discovering the alphabetic principle , snatched the discovery from under the Pharaohs ' noses ? and then taught them how to write alphabetically ! There is certainly a mystery here which is still to be solved , and much fame ( in learned circles ) awaits him who solves it . If the Egyptians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discover the principle of alphabetic writing , it is striking evidence that man might never have had this art except for the lucky accident which we shall now proceed to describe . Not being able to prove a connection between the alphabet and Egyptian writing , for the present we have to say that the oldest known genuine alphabet was the Old Semitic , ultimate ancestor of the scripts used today to write Arabic and Hebrew . This alphabet had , of course , been a syllabic script . How had it turned that all-important corner into alphabetic writing ? It seems probable that it was prompted in this direction by the structure of the Semitic languages , as we shall show . To us , the " root " of our verb ask is the syllable ask , to which various other syllables are prefixed or suffixed to make the various verbal forms , for example the past tense ( ask-ed ) , the progressive present tense ( is ask-ing ) , the third person singular present ( ask-s ) , and so on . With verbs like drive or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a syllable dr-ve or s-ng , where the dash indicates some vowel , but not always the same vowel , since we have drive , drove , driven , sing , sang , sung . Something is expressed by the alternation of these vowels , to be sure ( this alternation is technically called " Indo-European ablaut , " see Chapter IV , 2 ) , but the root of the verb is still a syllable , even with a variable vowel.  | It was probably some kind of ablaut system like this which led to the situation now characteristic of Semitic languages ( which is really just a further step in this direction ) , whereby the meaning of " driving " would inhere in the consonants D-R-V , that of " asking " in ' - S- K . In Semitic languages the " root " of a word is really a sequence of consonants ( usually three ) , modifications of the root being effected by kaleidoscopic rearrangements of the vowels intervening . Thus , anything to do with writing shows the consonants K-T-B , but " he wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meKTuB , " he got it written " = KaTtaBa ; " scribes " = KuTtaBun , and so on . Words which seem to us quite unrelated turn out to be , in this system , derived from each other , like SaL ? M , " peace , " iSLam , " the Mohammedan religion , " muSLiM , " a Mohammedan . " ( From salam we get ' aslama , " he pacified , subjugated " ; isle-1m is " subjugation , submission " to God , and muslim is " one who has submitted . " ) Obviously , no other type of language is better adapted to suggest to its speakers that there is a unit of word structure below the syllable ; that BA is in turn composed of B- and -A . This is precisely what other nations might never have guessed . In Semitic , where BA alternates constantly with BI and BU , and sometimes with B- ( the vowel being silenced ) , it is almost inevitable that every user of the language should develop a concept of the phoneme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true alphabetic writing . The structural nature of the Semitic languages is , therefore , in all probability the happy accident which became the key that unlocked for mankind , for the first and only time , the mystery of how to record speech by the method of maximum efficiency ? one which does not have so many characters as to make learning it a complex art demanding years of training nor require a skill in drawing which few possess , nor consume large volumes of material for a relatively small amount of recorded message . The consequences of this lucky accident are truly tremendous . If we did not have the alphabet , it would be impossible to hope for universal literacy , and therefore ( if Thomas Jefferson 's view was correct ) for truly representative government . Writing could have been kept a secret art known only to a privileged few or to a particular social class which would thus have an undue advantage over the others . Information could not nearly so easily be conveyed from nation to nation , VII - LANGUAGES AND WRITING  | and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might still be only goals to strive for . Truly , Prometheus did not do more for human progress than the unnamed scribe who first drew an alphabetic sign . 5 . The wanderings of the alphabet Let us here stress again that as far as can be ascertained from the available records , the principle of alphabetic writing has only been discovered once ? hence , in the whole world there is only one alphabet . It follows that any people which writes in alphabetic signs has learned and adapted the use of the alphabet from another people who , in turn , had done the same . When the wanderings of this most potent cultural innovation are plotted , it makes an impressive odyssey . But the same would no doubt be true of every other discovery which has figured in an advance of civilization , if the same means existed for following its trail . The earliest preserved inscriptions in alphabetic script date to about 1725 B.C. and were found in and around Byblos , in the country then known as Phoenicia ( now Lebanon ) . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Semitic was fairly familiar in that region at that time , though , as we have said , we can not establish precisely where this script was invented , or by which Semitic tribe . It has been suggested that several Semitic peoples might have hit on the alphabetic principle at around the same time ; but , if so , they seem to have soon adopted a common set of symbols . This Old Semitic alphabet is of course the ancestor of the Hebrew , Phoenician , and Aramaic systems of writing . From these northern Semites , the knowledge of the alphabet appears to have passed , on the one hand , to the Greeks of Asia Minor , and on the other , to the Brahmans of ancient India , who developed from it their devanagari , the sacred script in which the religious rituals and hymns of the ancient Hindus were recorded ( Fig. 21 ) . With this exception , it seems that the genealogy of every other alphabetic system of writing goes through the Greeks . And it was because of the structure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single improvement in the system : the origination of signs for the vowels . VII ? LANGUAGES AND WRITING  | The Semitic dialects had certain sounds which did not exist in Greek . The symbols for some of these , such as goph ( Q ) , the sign for the velar guttural which had existed in Indo-European but had everywhere been replaced by p in Attic Greek , were simply discarded by the Greeks ( except in their use as numbers , but that is a different story ) . In other cases , however , the Greeks kept and used the symbol for a syllable beginning with a non-Greek sound , but pronounced it without the foreign consonant ? so that the symbol became a sign for the syllable 's vowel . Thus , the first sign in the alphabet originally stood for the syllable ' A , where the sign ' represents the " glottal stop , " a contraction and release of the vocal chords ? not a phoneme in English , but used often enough as a separator between vowels ( e.g. , oh- ' oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a substitute for T : bo'le for bottle , tile for little . Some dialects of Greek had this sound , and others did not . Those which did ultimately lost it , so that the sign e ( by now written in a different direction , A ) everywhere became the sign , not for ' A , but for the vowel A. Other Semitic gutturals had had the tendency to influence adjacent vowels in the direction of 0 or U , and they accordingly , by the process just described , became the signs for those vowels . A rather good illustration of what was going on is found in the sign H , standing for the syllable HE . In Ionic Greek , where the sound h was eventually eliminated , H became the sign for the vowel e . In Sicilian Greek , however , where syllables beginning with h still remained , the same H became the sign for h ? which is our usage also , because we got the alphabet from the Romans , who got it from the Ionic Greeks , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our values for the alphabetic signs as compared with those of the standard ( Attic ) Greek alphabet ( see Fig. 22 ) . Since the alphabet had not been invented as a tool for writing Greek , each Greek dialect which adopted it had to modify it a little ? to assign different values to some of the signs , and discard the excess signs or use them in new ways , according to the phonology of their own speech . While practically all modern nations which have alphabetic writing got it directly or indirectly from the Romans , there are a few to whom the tradition passes directly from the Greeks , in some cases VII ? LANGUAGES AND WRITING  | concomitantly with direct northern Semitic influence . Between the third and fifth centuries A.D. , the spread of Christianity occasioned the devising of the ornamental and highly efficient Armenian , and the intriguing , delicate Georgian alphabets . And when the feared Goths were marauding throughout Latin Christendom , Ulfilas , child of a Gothic father and a Greek mother , became the St. Patrick of the Goths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , writing it with an alphabet ( Fig. 23 ) which , according to repute , he invented , basing it on Greek . Ulfilas ' lucky bilingualism not only gave us our oldest extensive records of any Germanic language , but also , it is believed , served as the basis of the Scandinavian " runic " writing ( Fig. 24 ) , although some think it was the other way around . Later , in the ninth century , when Christianity reached the Slavic peoples , two principal alphabets , the " glagolitic " and the " Cyrillic " ( the latter named in honor of one of its reputed inventors , St. Cyril , who died 869 A.D. ; the other inventor was his brother , St. Methodius , d. 885 A.D. ) , were devised to represent the then most generally used Slavic dialect . From these developed in the course of time the national alphabets of those Slavic peoples who were evangelized from Byzantium ? the Russians , the Ukrainians , the Bulgarians , and the Serbs ( Fig. 25 ) . ( In contemporary Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many non-Indo-European languages of the Soviet Union . ) Slays who got their religion from Rome had to struggle to put their complex Slavic phonology into the Latin alphabet , with what often seem ( to English speakers ) jaw-breaking results , as seen in names like Przmysl , Szczepinski and Wojcechowic . The name Vishinsky , as a rough transcription from the Cyrillic , is identical with the Polish name Wyszinski . From the great Roman empire the art of alphabetic writing passed , by inheritance or adoption , to virtually all the peoples who know it today . They were responsible for many interesting and important innovations in the basic system which there is not space to detail here , but which may be found in any thorough and complete history of the alphabet . We shall just point out a few of the most significant ones . The Romance-speaking peoples simply inherited their alphabet ; in many cases , they did not realize that they were not still speaking , as  | well as writing , genuine but perhaps rather careless Latin . When they made an effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize that theirs was actually a different language . It was during the time when Latin was still spoken , however , that the first modifications had to be made in the alphabet  --  leading to the first diacritic signs . The sound h became silent in colloquial Latin in the first century B.c. and in standard Latin by the second century A.D. Thereafter the letter was a zero , expressing nothing , and hence could be used with other letters to express variations : TH for something like T that was not quite a T ; GH for something like G that was not a G , and so on . Another early diacritic , perhaps the earliest , was the letter G. Words like signum had shifted in pronunciation at a very early period from SIG-NUM to SING-NUM to , probably , sego ( where the sign p stands for what is technically a " palatalized n , " as gn in French mignon or n in Spanish canon ) . This made the G , in this particular position , another zero : and the idea logically arose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by prefixing G to the latter : N/GN ; L/GL . Hence Romance languages blossomed with forms like egli , Bologna , segno , Cagliari . But Portuguese used the faithful H to express these sounds ( ilho , senhor ) , and Spanish , which had divested itself of doubled consonants , used a doubled letter ( castillo , suenno ) , and later used an abbreviation for the doubled n ( sueno ) ? for the Spanish tilde is nothing other than the well-known medieval Latin MS. abbreviation for an M or N ( tai , dOinfi , itetioe ) . Thus , the American who reads the Italian name Castiglione as Gastig-li-o-ni is murdering the harmonious genuine sound , since the spelling stands for Ca-sti-lyo-ne . When the practice ceased of using as names of the letters the names of the objects they had pictured ( or some meaningless derivative thereof , like alpha , beta ) , there arose the custom of naming a letter by giving ( in the case of a vowel ) its sound , or ( in the case of a consonant ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( In English this latter sound has uniformly shifted to i , so we say the letters of the alphabet e , bi , si , but Frenchmen say : a , be , se . ) In some exceptional cases , however , phonetic shift has eliminated the letter 's sound from its name . Our name for R is ar ( from earlier er by the same change which gives us heart , hearth , sergeant ) . In English pronunciaVII ? LANGUAGES AND WRITING  | that sound ? the choice between the rounded and the angular form being purely a matter of calligraphy . The English language , however , had both the V sounds and the W sounds ; so , to express the latter , English printers of the sixteenth century " doubled " the former , writing vv ( or uu ) . Latin also lacked any sound like English J ; but this sound appeared in Old French in words where Latin had had i , either as ee or as y ( januarius #@# janvier , iuvenis #@# jeune ) , and printers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this letter downwards in an ornamental flourish at the end of a number ( thus : xiij ) , and no doubt it was this which suggested the adoption in English printing of this alternative form of i for the j-sound . For quite a while , however , many printers continued to regard i/j and u/w/v as interchangeable , and to print John , starres aboue , A VVinter 's Tale , Jnterlude , and so on . We have been able to mention here only a few of the vicissitudes undergone by the alphabet ? the alphabet , only one , always the same ? in its long journey through space and time from the eastern shores of the Mediterranean to the far islands of the Pacific . There are , of course , many more details to the story , a genuinely fascinating one which the reader is urged to pursue in detail in some of the readings mentioned at the end of this chapter . 6 . The " perfect " alphabet ; the phonetic alphabet From all that has been said , it should be quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge whether the orthography of any nation is better than that of any other  --  to put it simply , whether French spelling , say , is " better " or " worse " than English . The terms " good " and " bad " as applied to an instrument evidently mean nothing other than how well it does the job it was designed to do . An alphabet , like any system of writing , is designed to record a language . We have already shown that the alphabetic method is the most efficient for this task . The best alphabet , therefore , would be the one which is the most alphabetic ? which most fully applies the basic principle of alphabetic writing in recording the language whose alphabet it is . Now , the basic principle of alphabetic writing is to devise one sep- arate sign , and only one , for each phoneme of the language . When there is a 1:1 correlation between the number of signs and the number of phonemes in the language ; when a given sound is always expressed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digraphs ( two letters to express one sound ) , nor cases of the same sound being expressed by different letters ( " alternative spellings " ) ; then you have the " perfect alphabet . " It can almost go without saying , of course , that no nation possesses a perfect alphabet , since each has adopted its alphabet from some other , and none has a system designed exclusively for itself . There would , of course , be nothing to prevent redesigning the system on the occasion of such an adoption ; and to a large extent this was done when the Greek alphabet was made the basis for Slavic ( Gothic , which we know only through its written records , we can not judge ) . The spelling of Spanish , too , was extensively revised in the eighteenth century . Welsh and Manx were also respelled . The results were , just as might have been expected , that these orthographies serve their respective languages much more efficiently than most others , including English . But in no case so far has there been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge and authority or prestige to do a perfect job along these lines . Because of the constant change and flux of language , too , it is unlikely that even a perfect alphabet would remain perfect for long . The effect of this is to put a penalty on eminence : the longer a language has had a recorded literature , the less efficient today , probably , is its spelling system ? devised , no doubt , for the language as it was spoken centuries ago . Thus both French and English have an utterly preposterous system of spelling , which constitute a real obstacle to learning these languages , by native speakers as well as others . But even certain American Indian dialects , for which a spelling was first devised only a century ago , have now changed to the point where the spelling no longer adequately expresses the language . Consider , too , that if the alphabet and rules of spelling ( which is what the term orthography embodies ) of a language like English were thoroughly revised by competent authorities and put on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would become much easier to learn , and bad spelling would have been done away with . But within two or three generations from the date of adoption VII ? LANGUAGES AND WRITING  | of the new system , everything ever written in the language prior to that date would be obsolete , and would either have to be reprinted in the new spelling or become , to 98 per cent of native speakers , as inaccessible as a medieval Latin MS . It is doubtful whether even the most uncompromising schoolteacher , once she fully realized the gigantic task involved here , would continue to maintain that it was not an excessive price to pay for good spelling on all her students ' themes ! Hence it is probable that each language will have to get along with the spelling it has , however the same was adopted or inherited , and that its alphabet will never be much more perfect than it was at the beginning of its history . The one attempt that has been seriously undertaken by adequately qualified people to devise an alphabet that would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own specific purpose , at any rate ? is that first proposed by the International Phonetic Association . It is called the IPA or " phonetic " alphabet , and every serious student of languages should be thoroughly familiar with it and the science on which it is based ( see Chapter XIII ) . The aim of the IPA alphabet is to provide one sign , and only one , for each of the speech sounds that can be produced by the human vocal apparatus . ( Naturally the number of such sounds varies with the sensitivity and discriminative power of the detecting instrument , up to infinity ; so practical limits are adopted : one speaks of " broad " or " narrow " transcription , the latter being approximately the maximum average discriminative power of the human ear ) . To accomplish this aim , the Roman version of the alphabet is taken as a basis , and diacritics and varying letter styles are freely used . ' We must be quite clear on one point : the phonetic alphabet does not aim to be , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does aim to be an alphabet in which any language can be written . This apparent paradox will be clear after the student has read Chapter XIV . The ideal alphabet for a given language would provide a single sign for each of its phonemes . But what is a single phoneme in the structure of a given language may consist of two or more sounds perfectly distinct to the ear . In a particular language , P and F may be regarded as the same unit , so that the phonetic transcription pifa might be considered and spelled as /pipa/ by native speakers . With  | a little close observation , you can readily hear that the p of pot and the p of spot are not the same sound , yet they are treated as such in English . The phonetic symbol is , therefore , essentially a formula expressing how the observed sound is produced by the vocal organs ( or defining its acoustic characteristics ) . It tends to belong more to physics or physiology than to linguistics . But it is the means of recording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based , and as such is indispensable to the linguist . Let students be duly warned that it is impossible to do really distinguished work on any level in linguistics without being an accomplished phonetician . It is important to say this , because many of the younger students of linguistics nowadays seem to be hunting the short cut , the Northwest Passage to achievement without real work , in linguistics as in life .  | PREFACE TO THE SCIENTIFIC DESCRIPTION OF LANGUAGE At this point we begin what might be regarded as the more " advanced " part of this book : a description and explanation of the techniques used by professional linguists in the study and treatment of the phenomena of language . Although this part is designed primarily for those who wish to master these techniques with an idea of making professional use of them , this does not rule out the general reader , who might wish to learn something about the basic " tricks " of this trade . Most of these basic tricks are descriptive in orientation , since linguistic comparison can be soundly based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have said , is one who applies the methods of science to the investigation of language . For him , therefore , the achievement of his ultimate objective would consist in being able to answer all questions that could be asked about language as a general concept , or about any particular language . In other words , he would be able to give a one-hundred-per-cent complete and accurate description of the topics mentioned ? a description which would contain the material to answer any possible question . Hence , a large part of linguistic science is concerned with the scientific description of a language . In what follows , therefore , it will be best and most efficient to present the material as a formula for the description of a language ? as " traditional grammar " is commonly presented ( unless , indeed , the presentation left us by the Romans was mistakenly taken as a formula for describing a language ) . In the chapters to come , principles and procedures will be broadly VIII ? THE SCIENTIFIC DESCRIPTION OF LANGUAGE  | outlined , and illustrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , occasionally from other languages likely to be familiar to the reader . It should be understood that no attempt is being made to give a really complete description of English or any other language , and that general principles and techniques might be applied differently in specific cases . 1 . The concept of " utterance " The procedure of science is always to gather data , classify them , form hypotheses , test the hypotheses , and thus arrive at the basic principles governing the phenomena under study . The field of language is no different : we first collect specimens of the language , then attempt to discover the principles governing the phenomena . Thus , the linguist first makes a record or recording of as much of the language as possible ? spoken , if at all possible , by native first speakers . This recording is then transcribed in phonetic symbols ( see Chapter XIII ) . With the phonetic text before him , the linguist now searches for a point of attack in seeking to elicit the structure of the text . He knows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units , but at this point he has no means of ascertaining the boundaries of such units . It is therefore necessary to set up an arbitrary provisional unit with which to begin work . This unit is the " utterance . " We may define the " utterance , " after Fries , as an amount of speech put forth by a single person before and after which there is maximum silence . The term " maximum silence " is to be defined as any interruption of speech by a silence ( on the speaker 's part ) which is either , for practical purposes , infinite , or at any rate longer than any of the other pauses observed during the course of speech . When the text consists of a conversation between two or more people , utterances are easy to mark off : they evidently lie between places where one person ceases talking and another begins . ( Obvious interruption of one speaker by another should be ruled out , of course , as Fries points out , ' but this will very rarely meet the definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more often characterized by overlapping . ) When only one person is speaking , however ( telling a story , for in- stance ) , it will still be found that in the course of his speech he makes pauses of varying length ; but they can be rated relative to each other , and those which are noticeably longer than the others can be identified as " maximum silences . " ( This does not , to be sure , eliminate a certain possibility of error , since maximum silence itself will probably vary in length , and it will probably turn out ultimately that a silence x milliseconds long or longer is maximum silence ; as a result , some maximum silences will be identified as belonging among the pauses shorter than maximum silence . This margin of error has to be accepted at this point , however , and once the structural picture has begun to emerge , the error will stand out and be easy to correct . ) It will be noticed that the units occurring between maximum silences vary in length over a considerable range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in long , continuous speech , like public addresses or story-telling . The significance of this difference will be brought out later . The definition here given does nothing , of course , to tell us what the structure of an utterance is , but at least it does two things : it gives us an experimentally observable unit with which to start ; and we may also feel reasonably sure that expressions conforming to this definition contain all the structure necessary in the language for structural completeness ? possibly more , but not less . Otherwise the listener would be bound to express his dissatisfaction or puzzlement in some way , before too long a silence . 2 . The parts of language We have said that a language is a system of vocal symbols by which thought is conveyed from one human being to another . We now ask how this system is constructed , what are its parts . A traditional approach assumes that the phenomena comprising any language can be classified in one or another of four categories , according as they concern : ( 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) the structural units making up the words , ( 3 ) the syntactic units ( words or word groups ) making up the ( simple , compound or complex ) sentences , and ( 4 ) the inventory of words in use in the language . VIII ' THE SCIENTIFIC DESCRIPTION OF LANGUAGE  | The traditional names for these categories are , respectively , Phonology , Morphology , Syntax , and Lexicon ( or Dictionary ) . The first three are often treated together in one book called the grammar , and the last in a separate book called the dictionary . With grammar and dictionary , it was presumed , the student would have the aggregate of what was to be known about any given language . As is so often the case , modern scientific linguistics has not invalidated this formula of description , but makes a few modifications . Within the last thirty or forty years , for instance , there has been an important change in point of view as to what should be the unit of description in phonology ? from the " phone " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in more detail later ( Chapter XIV ) . It has always been hard to draw the line clearly between morphology and syntax , since so many languages use syllables not only to build up words but also to establish the structure of the sentence and the role of the word therein . More recently , we have come to know languages which really do not have words ? that is , there is no level of structure between the syllable and the sentence , or , to put it in still another way , every word is a complete sentence and every sentence is but a single word . In the case of such languages , of course , there is no category of syntax , or at any rate syntax and morphology are identical , and the dictionary is something quite different from what we usually conceive under that term . There are also languages in which no word is more than one syllable in length ? in which , therefore , there is no morphology in the strictest sense , since whatever is accomplished by morphological means in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And , finally , syntax tends to divide into two subgroups which might easily be distinct categories , according as we are dealing with the components of a single sentence structure , or with combinations of two or more sentence structures . Despite these qualifications , the old formula is still serviceable and will be followed here in its main outlines . The order of procedure is equally logical starting from either end . Most texts begin with the simplest unit , therefore with the phonology ; we shall follow the reverse order . '   We have already ( Chapter I , 4 ) presented a theory of the word , under which it is regarded as a compound formed of two components , a physical element ( the sequence of sounds of speech ) and a semantic element ( the amount of meaning expressed by that segment of speech ) . For the more profound student , however , this will not be a satisfactory unit in terms of which to describe language , because some languages do not have words , and because most words have more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the more general terms formant and morpheme ? " morpheme " for any amount of thought , any section of the chain of thought , which is distinct by virtue of the fact that a distinct sequence of sounds , or other physical feature of language , is assigned to express it . The formant , of course , is the actual physical expression of the morpheme . Care must be taken not to equate the morpheme with the " concept " or any other psychological unit . A morpheme is simply a certain amount of thought , distinguishable only because it happens to have a linguistic expression in a certain language . Some concrete illustrations may make the matter somewhat clearer . It would seem that we could properly see in the English word book a case of one morpheme expressed by one formant ? the formant consisting of one syllable , a sequence of three phonemes . In the word hooks , however , we evidently have an additional formant ( the final -s ) expressing an additional morpheme ( what might be called the " idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two formants ( book- ) can occur by itself as a word , and is hence a free form in Bloomfield 's terminology ' ; the other ( -s ) can not occur independently as a word , but only within a word ? only as part of a word ; it is therefore , in Bloomfield 's term , a bound form . As is evident from this illustration , a formant is not necessarily a syllable . It is not even necessarily a phoneme . It may , for instance , be the use of one form instead of another : him instead of he , I instead of me . It may be the absence of a phoneme . In the case of verbs in English , for example , the absence of an -s where an -s could be present may be regarded as expressing plurality , since -s expresses the singular : run vs. runs . In such cases the term " zero formant " is some-VIII ? THE SCIENTIFIC DESCRIPTION OF LANGUAGE   times useful . ( Note that the " plurality " morpheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the actions expressed by the verb , but many performers of the action . ) The occurrence of one vowel instead of another within a word may be a formant : in froze , for example , the fact that the form is not freeze expresses a tense morpheme . The forms so far cited will also show that there is evidently no reason why the same formant ( e.g. , -s ) can not express more than one morpheme , either in different contexts ( e.g. , book/s = more than one book ' ; book ' /s = belonging to a book ' ; run/s = one individual runs ' ) , or even simultaneously : in Latin serous , for example , the formant sere- expresses the idea of " serving , " while the - us formant expresses the morphemes ( 1 ) singular , ( 2 ) masculine , ( 3 ) nominative ( subject of sentence ) ? all at once . The same morpheme can also be expressed by more than one formant : a language may have several different formants to express the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is different in different languages , even to the point of being characteristic of structure , so that it can be used as a norm in grouping and classifying languages ( see Chapter V , 1 ) . A word in any language , then , is ordinarily to be analyzed as a series of formants expressing a series of morphemes , and may be visualized thus : word ? morpheme + morpheme + morpheme formant + formant + formant + formant Of course , as we have seen , the total of morphemes above the line is not necessarily equal to the total of formants below the line , since one formant may express more than one morpheme ; also , any given formant below the line may quite possibly be found elsewhere expressing a different morpheme . A more accurate picture of the word 's construction might , therefore , be something like this : morpheme morpheme morpheme word ? morpheme + morpheme + morpheme + morpheme formant + formant + formant + formant There seems to be no definite limit to the number of formants that may occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may place on the length of the word .  | A logical question at this point is : how do we ascertain the number of formants in a word and the boundaries of each ? To this end we employ one of the basic tools of linguistics , commutation . Essentially , commutation is merely comparing words with each other , or , a little more precisely , comparing one item occurring in a given utterance with the same item as it occurs in another utterance . Thus we discover that individual syllables in a sequence of syllables can occur alone or in different sequences . It was a principle of De Saussure 's that language is spoken on a horizontal plane , but constructed on a vertical one . In other words , we pronounce the sounds and syllables of language one after another ; but just before each syllable is uttered , the speaker 's mind has chosen it from among all the syllables that could fit into the " chain of speech " at that point ? all of which , presumably , are present to his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression , it is most important to know what the alternatives were from which this particular one was chosen . A good illustration of how commutation works may be cited from Sturtevant , ' who once took his small grandchild to the doctor to have an infected ear irrigated . Later , when the child was suffering from a bad cold , he inquired whether he would have to be " nosigated . " The little boy had evidently identified the word " ear " in the word " irrigate , " and probably assumed that the remaining two syllables " - igate " were a formant expressing a morpheme " to flush with water or medicinal solution . " The same child , after a formation of four airplanes had been pointed out to him , shortly afterward inquired if two planes flying together were a " twomation . " Evidently , we establish the boundaries of formants by commuting in this way until we arrive at a form no part of which occurs in any other combination . If this leaves some forms whose occurrence is extremely limited ? say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that comparison or commutation does not enable us to ascertain very clearly the content of the morpheme , we are tempted to identify it as a variant of a more familiar formant . An example often cited is the Anglo-Saxon word brydguma , " a married man , " cognate to German Brautigam and containing two formants , bryde- meaning " marriage " VIII . THE SCIENTIFIC DESCRIPTION OF LANGUAGE  | and - guma ( cognate with Latin homo ) , meaning " man . " This word should have descended to modern English as bridegoom ; but , as the " meaning " of goom was unknown , the more familiar groom was substituted . There was at one time a tendency to call cucumbers " cowcumbers , " and asparagus ( formerly sparagus , Latin sparagi ) , " sparrowgrass . " Misidentification of formants creates many of the pitfalls in tracing etymologies . Because a final -z is a plural formant in English ( chair/ chairs , tree/trees ) , words borrowed from other languages containing final -z were often thought to be plural , and a singular which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in English . Thus Latin and Greek cerasus becomes French cerise and English cherries , whence we form a singular , one " cherry . " The wines made at Jerez de la Frontera in Spain ? Jerez having formerly been pronounced feres in Spanish ? were known in England as " sherries , " whence we take the false step of saying " Amontillado is a type of sherry . " Forms like " Chinee " and " Portuguee " have circulated in spoken English , but never became thoroughly established . Still more instructive , perhaps , is the " burger " series . This began with expressions in German such as Hamburger Wurst , Frankfurter Wurst , Wiener Wurst ? Hamburg , Frankfurt or Vienna sausage . The word Hamburger in German has two formants : Hamburg , the name of a city , and - er , a suffix indicating a place of origin . ' When these foods were brought to America , Hamburger Wurst was abbreviated to hamburger , which was probably ( through commutation this time in English ) identified as two entirely different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " burger , " presumably meaning " a piece of the previously mentioned food in a roll and served hot . " Hence we now encounter beefburgers , cheeseburgers , steakburgers , pizzaburgers , burger heaven ( an eatingplace specializing in " burgers " ) , and so on ad libitum . Since Burger in German means " resident of a small town " ( French bourgeois ) , it must occasionally seem a little bizarre in Germany to read how much Americans love to eat burgers . 5 . Message morphemes and structural morphemes When we have broken up a word through commutation into its formants , we shall find that some of the formants express morphemes  | which are part of the information being conveyed by this utterance , while other morphemes serve merely to indicate the structure of the utterance . A word like bookbindery can be divided into book/bind/er/y , where all the morphemes are message morphemes : - er meaning " one who does it " ( binding books ) , and -y meaning " place where such a person plies his trade . " But a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formant -s is here meant to relate the word bookbinder to another word in a sentence ; it does not add to the information conveyed , but only helps to clarify the construction of the sentence . In many languages it is not infrequent to find a free form ? an independent word ? which expresses a structural , not a message morpheme ; and sometimes the same formant expresses one structural and one message morpheme . A word like " the " in modern English is primarily structural , as a noun classifier ? though its message function , indicating " the one previously mentioned , " has not yet been forgotten . The well-known " Jabberwocky " in Lewis Carroll 's Through the Looking Glass gets its interesting effect by using , for all the message morphemes , formants which have no evident meaning to the average speaker of English . ' If we in turn substitute blanks for these , we shall have a text which is almost all structure and practically no message : As Alice remarked of this passage , " It seems to fill my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are ! " On the other hand , where the message is of paramount importance , or where the speaker has inadequate control of the structure of the language he is using , there is a tendency to drop out structural morphemes and present pure sequences of message morphemes , e.g. , him not know road Cheyenne . When one is learning a language , it should be possible to learn the structural morphemes and the formants which express them quite rapidly ? if they are efficiently presented from this point of view . This leaves only one problem ? mastery of more and more items of lexicon . VIII . THE SCIENTIFIC DESCRIPTION OF LANGUAGE   When we have divided a word into a series of formants , it is evident that the formants of the series are not all of the same chronological rank . For example , a word like archery presupposes a word archer ; and the latter , in turn , presupposes a word arch ( i.e. , " bow " ) . Had this series started off with a Germanic root , we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested , therefore , not only in the formants into which a word divides ? in their number and nature ? but in the order in which they have been put together . This can be represented for the case of archery , for instance , by the following arrangement : This could also be represented in another way : It will be noted that , at each level of structure , the ultimate form at that level has been produced by adding a new element to the resultant of the preceding operation . For this reason it appears to hold true that the immediate constituents at each level are never more than two . The second of the methods of graphic analysis illustrated above is probably preferable , since it shows at a single glance both the ultimate accretion and the order of formation . Analytic diagrams of this sort can sometimes become quite complicated ; addition to a base form can take place at the beginning , middle or end , and the element added may itself be an accretion . For example : Nevertheless , the construction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the immediate constituents are always two seems still to hold true . There is a strong feeling of chronology in the establishment of immediate constituents , since it seems a reasonable presumption that the layers of structure into which we dissect a word are those in which   it was formed : hence , when we have broken the word down , we have presumably uncovered a portion of the process by which the language developed . ' If a language does not have a unit equivalent to the word , the occurrence and order of formants is either determined by a structural principle or not . In the former case , the structure of the utterance ( i.e. , the sentence structure ) governs , there being no specific principle of word structure . We do not know of any authenticated example of a language which would belong to the latter type .   THE STRUCTURE OF TRANSFERRED UTTERANCES At this point we must pause to reflect on the relationship of language to the situation in which it is used . In its relation to reality , language is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , is that it does not have to be used in the circumstances which it symbolizes , but may be used to re-create in imagination a situation which no longer exists in reality , or , indeed , never existed . 1 . " Immediate " and " transferred " utterances For an illustration , suppose that you seat yourself at table in a restaurant during your lunch hour , and a waiter asks you what you wish to eat , and you give your order . What is the situation ? Your lunch . What ig the topic of conversation ? Your lunch . This is what we call an " immediate situation . " Suppose now that several hours later , back at your office , you mention your lunch to a friend , describing the restaurant and the waiter , what he said and what you said , and so on . What is the situation in which the speech is being uttered ? Your office . What is the subject of your speech ? Your lunch . You are using language to describe a situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which you are using the language ( the immediate situation ) . The importance of this distinction is that when language is used as a means of communication in an immediate situation , not all the information communicated will necessarily be conveyed by language . When you have sat down at a table in a restaurant , the circumstances express the message " I want to eat . " The waiter does not have to ask you if 2 ? Establishing basic structural patterns   you want food . If you did n't want to order a meal , you would have to tell the waiter so in language , since the situation carries an opposite implication . Failure to take account of the difference between immediate and transferred situation has needlessly complicated the systems of syntactic analysis proposed by some linguists . If we take the trouble to separate utterances observed in transferred situations from others , we shall find that the structure of the former is much less variable than that of the latter , and that immediate utterances are often recognizable as fractions of transferred utterances . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is mandatory to begin with transferred utterances , since only in these can we feel confident that all the morphemes expressed in the message are represented by linguistic material in the accompanying utterance . 2 . Establishing basic structural patterns To say that a linguistic utterance has structure is to say that ? as distinct from the case of a random series of words ? some principle is determining the words which occur and the forms and order in which they occur . Think of a load of structural steel just after delivery to a ( building site as compared to the erected framework of the building . I n the first case , any girder can be anywhere ; in the second , each must stand as it does , and no other way , because it has a function in the structure which it would not fulfill if differently placed . Or , suppose you are playing one of those games in which you draw cards from a pack , and each card has a word on it . The order in which the words come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you constantly endeavor to recognize in them meaningful combinations . To see meaning in one of these sequences of words , you would have to be able to see it as conforming to some standard pattern in the structure of your native language . The total number of structural patterns comprising the syntax of a language can not be very large or subtly organized , for the language must be used by all the people of a community , ranging from geniuses to morons ; and experience shows that morons , and even idiots to a degree , can learn the language of their country adequately enough   for communication . We may predict that when we have ascertained all the structural principles governing a given language , they will be few and simple , perhaps few enough and simple enough to be jotted down on the back of an envelope . To ascertain the structural principles determining the form of utterances , it is logical to start by looking for the shortest ( therefore least complex ) utterance which , in the language under investigation , is found among those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter , it will be remembered , we make sure that all of the message which was conveyed on the occasion of the utterance under investigation is represented by linguistic forms in the utterance . ) We choose the shortest utterance also on the reasonable assumption that it may turn out to be a nucleus from which longer utterances are built up . In English and many European languages we shall find that this minimum utterance in transferred speech is a two-word unit : ( 1 ) John left . We ate . Time passed . Morning came . There are , of course , other two-word structures in these languages besides the type illustrated above ; but they would not occur as complete utterances in transferred speech . ( Questions and their answers , calls , and commands belong to immediate speech , and will be dealt with in the next chapter . ) Now , if the minimum complete statement ( the minimum utterance ) is two words , we may reasonably conclude that the fundamental structure pattern has two functions ; and that each word ? aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these functions . Let us symbolize the two functions by Roman numerals : I-II . Note that we shall use Roman numerals to symbolize functions in the sentence.1It is very important , as remarked in Chapter VIII , 5 , to distinguish the linguistic material which signals the structure of the message from that which signals its content ? important , but not always easy , because frequently the signals for both are incorporated in the same word , even in the same syllable . Let us assume , then , that , in the languages cited , I-II is a basic 2 ? Establishing basic structural patterns   pattern for a sentence . To proceed from this point , let us use a very basic and always rewarding technique of linguistic analysis , what is called commutation ( see Chapter VIII , 4 ) : let us try to find out what we could substitute for either I or II without changing the structure . To start by commuting I , we will quickly find that such expressions as the following can be used interchangeably : Table I n other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , " " The great gate , " " Bill 's health " ? all different items of information ? are structurally identical ; each functions as I , even though it may consist of two or more words . To make the point still more strongly , let us alter the illustration to the following : Table Here commutation has revealed four structures ? four principles of organizing words ? which will fulfill the I function in the I-II sentence . To highlight the structure , and abstract it as far as possible from the message information , we shall express them in special notation . ( We shall explain later ? see Section 3 ? the values of the symbols and how we arrive at them . ) Table There are , of course , more than four structures which can fulfill the I function in the I-II sentence , but as our concern here is not to make a complete analysis of English but rather to suggest the method for IX ? THE STRUCTURE OF TRANSFERRED UTTERANCES   making such an analysis of English or any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked out . The total of such patterns , however , is not twenty , probably not fifteen . It will be noticed that the pattern d ' -I falls into a rank of patterns subordinate to the pattern I-II . The latter is a sentence structure , while the former is a sentence-component structure ? one which the native speaker does not consider complete , because it does not make a sentence , only a part of a sentence . We may use two terms originated by Bloomfield for these two types of word patterns : let us call sentence patterns exocentric structures , and sentence-component patterns endocentric structures . ' It is evident that a tabulation of all the exocentric and endocentric structures in use in a language would be a complete description of the syntax of that language . This is the modern position superseding the traditional assumption that a listing of all the systems of inflectional endings ( paradigms ) completely describes a language 's structure . An entirely similar commutation can , of course , be performed with the other half of the I-II sentence structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinct can easily be shown by demonstrating that nothing which will commute for II will commute for I , and vice versa . Expressions such as " banged closed " or " the door it " are not sentences or utterances ; they have no structure ; they are meaningless . In the illustrations just given , note that we were keeping the structure completely identical , varying only the content of the message ( by using different words in the II function ) . Compare , now , the following series : Table   This gets very close to the border between structure-expression and content-expression . On the exocentric level , of course , these sentences are indistinguishable from those which preceded them . But on the endocentric level , this case seems more closely to resemble four alternative structures for II rather than four alternative words ( all of them the same endocentric structure ) . Different words in the same structure normally express different messages . But here we are not dealing with completely different words , but with what appear to be modifications of the same word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a variation in morphology ( the structure of the word ) , sometimes by using it in conjunction with other words , sometimes by both devices . As we have seen elsewhere ( Chapter VIII , 3 ) , where these differences are expressed by different endings on the same word , such endi ngs are both structural and message-bearing , but the message morphemes expressed have almost become part of the structure , since the language so regularly expresses them ; for example , in English , whatever information you want to convey , the language requires you also to determine and express the time and aspect of any actions mentioned ; French requires you to determine and express " grammatical gender , " and so on . While structural patterns have as their main purpose the organizing of word sequences into recognizable and predictable units , there is no reason why they can not , secondarily , express content differences also . Naturally , it is precisely these which will be neglected by the speaker who " knows how to make himself understood " ( i.e. , convey the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the structure of the language is shaky . ( Conversely , the student is generally trained to be very precise in this sort of thing , while remaining unable to express himself at all . ) Variations of the type close/closed , therefore , constitute a suborder of differentiation among endocentric structures which are identical from the point of view of sentence structure . 3 . Structural word classes : " parts of speech " So far , then , it appears that in English and several other well-known European languages , the simplest and minimum exocentric ( sentence ) structure is I ? Il ? two words , of which one fulfills Function I , the other Function II . We have seen that there are a number of endocentric IX ? THE STRUCTURE OF TRANSFERRED UTTERANCES  | structures consisting of two , three or more words which can fulfill the I function , and , likewise , a number which can fulfill the II function . An obvious question now is : When we hear a two-word utterance , how do we know that it is I-II and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word is I in the structure and which is II ( for , in a given language , might not the order II-I have a different meaning ) ? Clearly there must be signals to give us this information . Position alone could do it if there were no other two-word patterns ; in that case , " first of two " would be the signal for I , and " second of two " would be the signal identifying II . But , as we have said , there are other two-word structures , both exocentric and endocentric . A second way for a language to identify the sentence-function of a word is simply to require the native speaker to know , as part of the grammatical data of the language , that a certain word always functions a certain way . The learner of the language , in other words , must learn a list of words which function as , say , I , even though they bear no sign to show this . In this case , the list for any given function is always a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the native speaker , it would be unworkable . The words which are traditionally called " pronouns " are examples of such a list . Proper names are another : whatever is recognized as the name of an individual of a species is recognized as I without further specification . A third device would be to affix a syllable to the word which is to function as I , a syllable whih , whether or not it expresses anything else , carries the meaning " Functioning as I in the structure I-II . " This was the method of a language like Latin . We say " slave , " but Latin said sera-us ? the extra syllable expressing the notions ( technically the morphemes ) of " nominative " ( i.e. , " functioning as I " ) , " singular , " and " masculine " ( see Chapter XII , 6 ) . Even in English some use is made of this device : words ending in - hood , - ness , - dom normally function as I in sentences . Another method would be to use a word to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is the method of English ; a word functioning as I is normally preceded by the definite or indefinite article : ( the ) door/closed . In this case , of course , the article is a word whose almost sole purpose is to convey information about structure , and which hardly conveys content-meaning at all .   We shall call such words determinants , ' and mark them in our notation with a small letter ; thus , the article ( and certain similar words , such as the demonstrative pronouns and the numerals ) is Determinant Number 1 , or dl . In English , the article serves to signal that the next word ( or the next but one or two in certain other wellknown structures ) is I in the structure I-II . Any word , or even word group , to which d ' is prefixed thereupon discharges Function I and can commute with anything else which does so ; for example : " the hunt rode " ( i.e. , " the fox-hunt began " ) , vs. " we hunt " ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a run occurred at the bank " ; " three men " ; " six feet . " Words appearing in the function of II also have means of identifyi ng themselves ? through characteristic syllables ( such as - ed and - en ) which are seldom or never added to nouns ; through characteristic combinations of words ( " will speak , " " have spoken " ) , which do not occur among the structures functioning as I ; through non-use of the article . This marking of words to indicate actual or potential function in a sentence structure naturally creates word classes , i.e. , groups of words marked in the same way . These are what traditional grammar called " the parts of speech . " All words marked to function as I naturally fall into a class by themselves ? a class which , in English , includes what are traditionally called " nouns , " but also pronouns , numbers , and a certain number of expressions consisting of more than one word ( multiverbal endocentric structures ) . Thus , a word belonging to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for it is not entirely equivalent to the traditional concept of a noun ; we prefer to call it " a nominal , " and members of category II , " verbals " rather than " verbs . " Are there other word categories and determinants besides those so far mentioned ? There are , if there are in English other exocentric structures besides I-II , and if at least some English words are distinctively marked to give them a function therein . 4 . Exocentric and endocentric structures Though a great many English sentences can be reduced to the I-II formula ? especially if all multiverbal endocentric structures equiv- alent to either element are taken into account ? there are , indeed , several other basic sentence patterns in English . What has been said so far will suggest the method by which additional basic patterns are established . ( The first new step , for example , would be to isolate three-word sentences in transferred speech which can not be reduced to I-II . ) The principal basic sentence patterns of English , to which at least 95 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see Chapter X ) can be reduced , are as follows : Table A single utterance may , of course , include the elements of two or more basic sentences ; e.g. , I-II-III-IV ( he/rode/tall/in the saddle ) , I-II-I ? - IV ( he/ate/the apple/slowly ) . Elements may also be repeated , e.g. , I-II-IV-IV ( she/wept/very/quietly ) . We now turn to endocentric structures , considering first those commutable with I. Table This list may not be complete , but structures other than the above are rare . Note the introduction of d3 for a determinant indicating that the next word has the same function as the preceding one ( traditional term " conjunction " ) . Note , also , that any commutation of I can be used in its place , even in the structures just cited : e.g. , I = dl-I ( ones , the barber ) . This can lead to sentences apparently very corn- plex ; also , d ' can label almost any following structure as I : It/contained/a je ne sais quoi . I ? II ? I ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Table Endocentric Structures Equivalent to III Equivalents to III , which we name " adjectival expressions " or adjectivals , are in English and other Germanic languages almost always established by position . In these languages , the structures III ? I ( cold winters ) and d ' ? III ? I ( the big house ) are so familiar that anything in the III position in this pattern can be recognized as III : up-to-date news ; under-the-counter transactions ; the I-don't-care girl : a down-to-earth individual ; the **28;116;TOOLONG method . Still , there are some adjectival suffixes , such as , for instance , - like , cf. child/childlike ; a contemporary speaker of English would probably say " monkeylike " rather than " simian . " Note that traces of the Romance structure , I ? III , can be found in English , usually ( but not always ) outside ordinary usage , for instance , court-martial , lieutenant-general , body politic ; fee simple ; the Swiss Family Robinson ( a bad translation for " a Swiss Robinson family " ) ; Goody ' Iwo-Shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Table Note that we classify what many languages call " the dative case " as structurally equivalent to an adverb or adverbial phrase . This is based on commutation : " I gave him the book " is the equivalent of " I gave the book to him . "   Insofar as a dative exists in English , it is expressed only by structure , as indicated in Number 5 above , where the position of IV in the exocentric structure is the signal of its function : I-II-I-I is normally interpreted as Subject-Verb-Indirect Object-Direct Object . If something were substituted for the second I , the sequence would probably become ambiguous ( the first I being taken as I " ) ; cf. Shakespeare 's " Knock me at the gate " ( II-I ? - IV or II-IV-IV ) , Johnson 's " Call me a cab " ( II-IV-Ie interpreted as II-I ? - IC ) . Where this dative survives and is clear ( " I spoke him fair , " " I told him so " ) it is because the verbs in the sentence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dative . " We are now in a position to list the structural words we have called " determinants . " Table Note , also , the use of either the symbol @#@ or #@# to indicate the morpheme " of , " whether expressed by that word or by part of another word : " the top of the hill " ( dl-I @#@ " Bill 's house " ( I #@# I ) , " mother mine " ( I @#@ I ) . This special symbol is needed because , while we might postulate a d ' corresponding to " of , " the function is frequently ( even in English ) indicated by an ending on a word , which would require a different symbol , and we want to avoid having two symbols for the same morpheme . The purpose of @#@ is to indicate that the preceding ( or following , according as it faces ) I-structure is subordinated to the other one in such a way that the two together function as I ( the " genitive relation " ) , not as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , of course , been our purpose in this chapter to develop a complete grammatical analysis of English or any other language , but only to suggest how such an analysis would be worked out . Nevertheless , the principles and notation presented here will enable the reader , should he care to try , to work out the structure of a great majority of utterances in English .   To summarize the method ( which has been developed from the work of Charles C. Fries , although there has been considerable adaptation , especially of the notation ) , one first seeks to establish t he basic sentence patterns of the language , those to which all actual utterances ( in transferred speech ) can be reduced ; that is , to determine all the distinct functions in the sentence , in terms of which any possible sentence can be analyzed . These functions will always be revealed in signals5 ? the exact nature of which will , of course , vary with the type of structure of the language ? which tell the native speaker the functions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by analysis and commutation of utterances . The basic sentence patterns of a language are its exocentric structures . The next step is to investigate the level of structure just below this ? the endocentric structures , or patterns of word groups ? multiverbal structures which discharge a basic function in the sentence just as a single word would do . A complete list of all the exocentric and endocentric structures of a language , plus a presentation of the signals used by the language to identify to the user of the language the functions of words and other structural elements ( the " paradigms " of Latin and Greek grammar , which were taken as the complete analysis of structure for all languages , were roughly this kind of presentation ) , would be a complete statement of the syntactic structure of any language . On one condition , of course : that " immediate " speech , which we have ruled out of consideration until now , is not differently structured . This question we shall now proceed to examine .   THE STRUCTURE OF IMMEDIATE UTTERANCES To resume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " immediate " speech that speech whose subject ? whatever the language discusses ? is present to both speaker and hearer at the time the speech is produced . This is , of course , in contrast to " transferred " speech , whose subject is not present to either the speaker or hearer at the time the speech is produced , and therefore can not be known by the hearer through any means other than language . The importance of this distinction is that immediate utterances may require less language than transferred utterances to communicate the information which the speaker wishes to convey to the hearer , since the hearer can gather certain information by observation and by reasoning from observation . This is a cardinal principle underlying the whole argument of the present chapter . 1 . Incomplete utterances It has been shown in Chapter IX that an utterance in transferred speech normally has a definite structure , and that this structure is always one or a combination of a few basic patterns provided by each language for the purpose ; these were discussed , and a technique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the " sentence " ) is so well established and so well understood by native speakers of the language that such speakers are immediately aware whenever they hear an utterance in which an essential element of the pattern is lacking . This awareness is shown in the hearer 's behavior and speech . If you turn to a friend and say , " My brother , yesterday , " X ? THE STRUCTURE OF IMMEDIATE UTTERANCES  | he , after a second , says impatiently , " Yes , yes , go on , " or " Your brother what ? " or " Well , well , what about your brother ? " or any of a number of similar expressions . Perhaps the principal complaint of teachers of English in the grammar grades is that their pupils write " incomplete sentences . " This is a significant problem , though less simple than it seems . Unless interrupted or physically unable to pronounce all the words , ' native speakers never speak in " incomplete sentences , " even when their minds are subnormal or psychotic . Upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but write sentences which , if read according to their own punctuation , are incomplete . The trouble generally turns out to be that they do not understand punctuation , and write , for instance , a comma where they should put ( and in speech do put ) a period . ( The school textbooks , however , generally try to explain punctuation in terms of " grammar , " and , while adjuring the pupil to put a period at the end of a complete sentence , usually leave him with no realistic criterion of what a complete sentence is except that it has a period at the end of it . ) " This teaching problem stands apart from our concern here , but it helps to establish the fact that native speakers are keenly aware when the structure of an utterance is " incomplete " ? in transferred speech , that is . Immediate speech is a different matter altogether . 2 . The fractional nature of incomplete utterances If the utterances which occur in immediate situations were collected and studied , it is the contention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be mentioned specifically ? they would always be found to be fractions of complete sentences . Although space is not available to give a really thorough demonstration , the general line of reasoning can be indicated . A number of utterances occurring in " immediate " or contact situations are listed below in the first column . ' In the second column is an analysis of the structure of these utterances , according to the formulae developed in Chapter IX ; and in the last column are possible sentences in which each utterance could occur , showing how each structure fits as a fraction into the larger structure . ( In many cases , this sentence is the one from which the fraction is known historically to have been abbreviated . ) '   Table These examples are from telephone conversations , which do not , perhaps , constitute the typical " contact " situation . Examples of another type can be found in titles and signs , which are usually structure I ? that is , a nominal expression , possibly quite complex on the next level or levels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I in a complete sentence pattern , such as : the house of the old woodcutter , I Table or the man with the pack on his back , I Table Take , for example , signs on buildings : " Graybar Building , " " Doylestown Hospital , " " Odd Fellows Hall , " " Masonic Temple , " and so on ; or paintings in a gallery : " Venetian Sunset , " " Cos Cob , Connecticut , in 1831 , " and the like . All of these probably imply sentences like " ( This is the ) Odd Fellows Hall , " or something similar ? the linguistic demonstrative formula " This is ( the ) . . . " being quite unnecessary when you are standing in front of the object to which it would call your attention . Slightly different structures may be observed in " No Parking Here , " " No Parking This Side , " " Left Turn Only , " " By Authority , " where the implication is " No parking ( is permitted ) on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by authority ( of the police ) . " X ? THE STRUCTURE OF IMMEDIATE UTTERANCES   Note , too , that many expressions which occur most often , if not exclusively , in immediate situations are actually complete sentence patterns ; for example : Table The two categories of utterances used in immediate situations which have so far been mentioned are identifiable as either complete sentence patterns or fragments of complete sentence patterns and also do not present a very great range of variety . Moreover , they are recognizable as appropriate to one side of a conversation ? so much so that they can sometimes be used without regard to what the other speaker has just said . ' A relatively short list would include over 90 per cent of those encountered . The remaining category , however , comprises expressions which , though still identifiable as sentences or sentence fragments , occur altogether unpredictably and with limitless variety . These expressions , besides , are altogether meaningless standing by themselves . Examples of the expressions now in question are : Table These expressions lose most of their peculiarities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classify , if we make one simple assumption : that for purposes of classification , we may count as part of an immediate utterance anything in the utterance just made by the previous speaker . In other words , since the utterances in question are always responses to other utterances , it is hardly illogical to suppose that the second speaker saves himself time and trouble by not repeating words just uttered by his interlocutor . Viewed in this way , the mysterious , incomprehensible fragments   listed above become perfectly clear and simple when taken as fragments repeated from some preceding patterns and word groups . To illustrate , here are the citations with the utterances which , in the contact situation , immediately preceded them : Table Lest it should be thought that we are making an unwarranted postulate in claiming that " Thanks ! " implies , and is possibly abbreviated from , a sentence such as " I give you thanks , " we may cite examples in languages other than English , where surviving case forms clearly prove the point . Latin says gratias ; why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , which also occurs . German says danke schon ; the schon does not agree with danke , and the expression certainly does not mean " fine thanks , " but evidently is short for either ( ich ) danke ( Ihnen ) schon or ( ich gebe Ihnen ) Danke schon . In German , also , " good morning " is guten Morgen , where the accusative form of the adjective clearly implies an expression like ( ich wunsche Ihnen einen ) guten Morgen . The principle operating here is also seen in cases where a linguistic pattern or formula of more than minimum length occurs so frequently , or in such self-explanatory contexts , that a part of it can easily fulfill the function of the whole ? for example , in the case of numbers , where " nineteen hundred and sixty " regularly becomes " nineteen sixty , " sometimes " nineteen and sixty " ; " four dollars and twenty-five cents " becomes " four twenty-five " ; " two shillings and six pence " becomes " two and six , ' " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably does not X ? THE STRUCTURE OF IMMEDIATE UTTERANCES   require demonstration . Significant , however , is the implication that the short , terse expressions used in everyday contact situations appear to be always abbreviated from the fullest and most complete structures in the language . This is , of course , just the reverse of what has generally been assumed , that complex structures were " gradually built up from the grunts of primitive man . " It is on this assumption , in turn , that teachers of languages have proceeded in using the abbreviated expressions of conversation with which to begin courses in a language . It would seem that the reverse procedure might be pedagogically superior . 3 . Monomorphemic structures : imperative and vocative A story is told that when a tourist in Moscow inquired of his guide how it happened that certain Soviet citizens had cars with chauffeurs while most did not , he was told that " in the classless society , all citizens are equal , but some are more equal than others . " In the same way it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definition given above ( Chapter IX , 1 ) are immediate or contact situations , some of them are more immediate than others . The contact situations par excellence are those involving questions , calls and commands . Many languages have special structures for utterances falling into these categories . In English and related languages we encounter in these cases a characteristic structure which , in its most elemental form , is restricted to a single morpheme , ' as in calls ? " John ! " ; " Captain ! " ; " Doctor ! " ? or in commands ? " Run ! " ; " Speak ! " ; " Listen ! " The structure here is evidently /I/ in the first case , /II/ in the second ; in other words , a single-morpheme structure is a call if the single morpheme is a nominal , a command if the single morpheme is a verbal . Where the form used is not structurally marked or more common in one function than the other ( " speak " is rarely a nominal ) , there is ambiguity : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " there is a fire . " But the situation determines the choice . These structures are , of course , like other sentence patterns , capable of expansion : " Mr. Smith ! " or " Captain of the Guard ! " or " You in the brown coat " are multiverbal structures equal to I ( the first is I the second I the third I ) ; " come here ! " or ( I = I ) ( I ( ( dz ? dl ? I ) ( I ? IV ) " Go quickly ! " are easily analyzed as II ? IV .   In languages similar to ours , therefore , we may say that a " complete " utterance must include at least I and II in transferred speech , but may be restricted to either I or II in immediate speech . The absence of I in an utterance , therefore , will signal to the hearer that the utterance is immediate speech , and is either a command ( e.g. , " come to the fair " ) or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... and came to the fair " ) .9 A special intonation is often given to calls and commands , and may be counted as a structural formant expressing the call or command situation ; but it is not essential to the situation , as may be seen from the fact that the nature of the utterance is usually perfectly clear in a written document , even if the latter be wrongly punctuated and read aloud with the wrong intonation . In other languages the call-and-command structure may not be so different from the structures of other utterances . In Latin , for instance , every word had to have endings ? structural formants ? which defined its function in the sentence or in sentence-component structures . If the word was part of a call , it had the " vocative " ending : servus = " slave , subject " ; servum = " slave , object " ; serve = " slave , called to . " ( In time , of course , the vocative " ending " became identical with the nominative ; but this was part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command had an " imperative " ending ( in the plural : vale-te , voca-te ; in the singular , it was usually a zero formant , and the whole form often became identical with the stem : dic , voca ) . If one should here cite two-morpheme " imperatives " like German bleiben Sie , these will turn out to be the exceptions that prove the rule : for these are not imperatives , but " hortatory " subjunctives . The essence of any subjunctive is that it is a form which puts the hearer on notice that the verb so marked does not necessarily state a fact , or what the speaker believes to be a fact ? which is always the implication of the ( " indicative " ) forms normally used in speech . Because of this significance , subjunctive forms are naturally used in the expression of hopes , wishes , opinions , doubts , conditional statements , and so on . ( Compare the toast , " Long live the Queen ! " ? we do n't know whether she will or not ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fiftieth year of Victoria 's reign : " Long lives the Queen ! " ) The subjunctive therefore comes to substitute for a command when there is a feeling that the normal form for a command is too per- emptory and a polite hope should be expressed instead . To a servant , one may say , " Open the door ! " But to a social superior , one feels that one should rather say , " I hope it may please His Excellency that he should open the door . " In the liturgy of the Mass , the few occasions when the priest says to the congregation , orate ! ( " pray ! " ) probably date farther back than oremus ! ( " let us pray ! " ) ? although , in the later Roman Empire , the meaning was probably practically identical . 4 . Quasi-imperatives and interjections We have seen that a basic characteristic of immediate speech situations is a tendency to take advantage of the nature of such situations to limit linguistic expression as much as possible : wherever a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safely be assumed to be evident from the situation ? including words that have just been uttered ? the linguistic forms required for their expression are regularly suppressed , even though , it appears , the complete structure required in transferred speech is always first conceived and virtually present . It is in the light of this principle that some of the most irregular and perplexing utterances met with can be satisfactorily explained . If a certain expression , however it originates , comes to be standard in a certain situation , any part of the expression , it seems , may assume the function of the whole . As a result , we not infrequently encounter words used in a way quite different from their original or ostensible function ; but the expression will be perfectly comprehensible as soon as we discover the steps which have led to its present use , or the circumstances in which it is normally used . This occurs most commonly in commands , which frequently have the structure II ? IV , and are abbreviated to IV : " Hence ! " ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Down ! " ? a verb like " go " or " get " having originally been a part of all these utterances . A IV ? IV structure is less common : " Under the bed , quickly ! " The pattern I ? ? IV , or , IV ? I ? is seen in military commands , e.g. , " Eyes . . . right ! " and " Right shoulder . . . arms ! " ? evidently for " ( Turn your ) eyes ( to the ) right , " " ( On the ) right shoulder ( put your ) arms . " Military commands , in fact , have often been deliberately conformed   to the formula " command of information " and " command of execution " : in other words , it is necessary to make clear to the soldiers , first , what it is they are to do , and second , the precise moment when they are to do it . For this reason , perfectly regular structures like " Face to the left ! " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . face ! " and " To the rear . . . march ! " On the other hand , sometimes a two-word command in the structure II ? IV becomes so familiar in a typical situation as to be reduced to one word . Thus , for some reason , " Come ! " does not seem strong enough in contemporary American English , and one usually says instead " Come here ! " or " Come on ! " ? but these are pronounced as one word , C'mere , C'm on : the fairly common situation of starting with two formants to express two morphemes , then the coalescing of the formants , leaving one formant expressing two morphemes . ( Another example is Latin ad ilium #@# Old French al #@# Modern French au , once pronounced au , and therefore still just possibly analyzable as two formants , but now pronounced o . ) This , perhaps , suggests how a great many , if not all interjections originated . Two contemporary speakers of American English meet , and one says to the other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " how are you ? " = hawaja #@# ha:ja #@# haj , and the origin is still fairly well remembered , for the person addressed may reply , " And how are you ? " The older expression " hello " is probably related to hail , hale and health , and might have originated in a phrase like " be hale , 0 ! " ( Romans said salue , " be well , " and the ancient Irish said slan leat , " let there be health to you . " ) The fact that interjections are different in different languages , and follow the phonetic development of their respective languages ( e.g. , Germanic ach becoming och in Scottish and oh in English ) , suggests that they were not always in a class by themselves . 5 . The structure of questions and negatives In many languages , questions have a highly characteristic structure , quite divergent from any of the other utterance-patterns , even including those used for immediate situations . In some ways , as will be shown , the treatment of questions seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are normally used in immediate situa- tions , in the sense that ( with the rare exception of rhetorical questions , which are clearly an artificial stylistic device ) a hearer who is expected to answer is always present . However , the subject matter of the question may be something not present to speaker and hearer . Questions , therefore , are not pure immediate speech . It might be supposed a priori that the logical way to structure a question would be to have a formant expressing the question morpheme and to introduce it into the sentence in any convenient position , so that the question corresponding to the statement , " He is a doctor , " would be , in literal translation , " Question he is a doctor , " and in idiomatic translation , " Is he a doctor ? " The formant or particle might have two possible positions , one making a question of the whole utterance ( as in the illustration just given ) , the other calling into question only an individual term , e.g. , " He is a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " ( Note the similarity here to the behavior of negatives . ) Some languages do just this , for example Russian with its particle li . Another relatively simple , though linguistically somewhat more sophisticated method of handling the question situation would be to adopt an intonation formant ? a characteristic intonation pattern which can turn a statement into a question with or without any other structural device . Russian , again , uses this method , and so does English in sentences like : " He 's a doctor ? " Languages which make no other use of intonation patterns may be found using one unique toneformant for this purpose . Interrogative and negative structures eventually get intertwined with each other , because questions , like statements , may be positive or negative : the negative question equivalent to " He is a doctor ? " would be " ( Is it true that ) he is not a doctor ? " Here , however , other factors generally become involved to complicate the situation . There may be an impingement of the immediate situation ( see Chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their logical meaning to express the speaker 's emotional attitude or the answer expected . Combination of a negative question with a positive one often expresses the speaker 's impatience , as if to say , " Is it so ? or not ? Give me an answer one way or the other ; do n't leave me in suspense ! " In English the simplest negative interrogatives now primarily suggest the answer expected . Compare the following :  | Table The last is the real negative question , but note that " no " in answer to a negative question is equivalent to " yes " ? that is , it indicates agreement ; by the same token " yes " would mean " no ! " 10 Latin had a similar system for suggesting the expected answer : Table It has been suggested that both a negative particle and an interrogative particle represent a fairly high degree of abstraction , and that probably in the early stages of the history of language ( again permitting ourselves to speculate where we have no evidence ) it was more probable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrogative verbs , rather than one verbal form for all three , shifted from one to another by a negative or interrogative particle ; the latter is a more efficient system , but requires longer to develop . To corroborate this hypothesis , a certain number of parallel positive-and-negative verbs can be cited : Latin dicere , " to speak , " tacere , " not to speak " ( " to be silent " ) ; scire , " to know , " ignorare , " not to know " ; adesse , " to be present , " abesse , " to be absent " ; German sprechen/schweigen , and so on . When we find in Celtic a more or less regular process along these lines , where a verb shifts to a different form when it is negative or interrogative , so that chonnaic me means " I saw , " but ni fhaca me means " I did not see " ; tti me means " I am , " but bhfuil me means " am I ? " , we are tempted to think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , the evidence does not justify this hypothesis . Careful investigation reveals that , insofar as these alternations tend to form a system , it is a system in process of development rather than the breakdown of one formerly general . The parallel forms that can be listed are , for one thing , always an infinitesimal minority of the negatives and interrogatives in the language ; and what is more , it can often be shown that the " negative verb " was   derived from the positive one at some remote period , either by a negative particle or some other prefix : *gno-sk-o #@# Latin gnosco , *n-gno s o #@# Latin ignoro ; *con-icc #@# chonnaic , *fo-icc #@# fhaca . One other question-structure which accounts for the form of questions in a considerable number of languages is the switching of position of I and II ( " You are . . . " becomes " Are you ... ? " ) , which seems to pervade all the Germanic tongues . It never was at home in Romance languages , and French , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it via such formulae as est-ce-que , and etais je ? is now rare or literary . This latter device has also developed in English since the eighteenth century : we no longer say " he likes it not " and " go you ? " but rather " he does n't like it , " " do you go ? " ( or " are you going ? " ) . The interrogative formula , of course , can become equivalent to our first device ? a formant expressing a question morpheme . Another factor that complicates the structure of questions is that in many languages the normal forms of speech imply that the speaker is stating what he at least believes to be a fact , and that if he has any reason to doubt its factual nature , the hearer must be alerted to this by special forms ( subjunctives or optatives ) .11 Questions and negatives , naturally , almost always call for these special forms . Classical Greek , for instance , had one negative particle ( oti ) that was used to deny that something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e.g. , " he is not here " ) , and a different one ( ? rd ) to deny that something considered a mere possibility would become real ( e.g. , " that it might not rain " ) . Thus Ulysses told Polyphemus ( Odyssey ix . 366 ) that his name was Outis , not Metis , so that later when the giant cried , " Outis blinded me , " it would be a negative statement of fact , understood as " I was not blinded by anyone . " Had he used Metis in his cries , the meaning would have been " May no one hurt me. " 12 Oddly enough , the words which speakers of Indo-European languages think of as " interrogative " words par excellence are not directly related to questions in the sense in which we have been discussing them ? namely , utterances specially patterned to elicit from the hearer confirmation or denial of a statement . The " interrogative " words of Indo-European bear the same relation to words used in that type of utterance as a word negating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement : in other words , the " interrogative   pronouns " and their ilk , while making the sentence in which they occur interrogative , question only one item in it ? nor do they question its existence , they merely ask whether this particular one is the object of choice . The interrogative words ? apparently all marked in Indo-European by an initial Q-sound ? are correlative with the demonstratives , the system apparently being : Table While this is the underlying system , the primary use of these correlatives seems to have been in question-and-answer situations : Table Since the closest relation of these words is to the demonstrative , we may analyze them as formants expressing a demonstrative morpheme plus a question morpheme ; " What ? ? That " could be paraphrased as " Query , that ? confirm , that " ? and so with the others illustrated . Since a query is expressed , the sentence becomes interrogative ; still , the query is not about the truth or falsehood of the proposition expressed by the sentence , but only as to the choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the precise nature of the alternative chosen . What is clear is that these words were not meant to be , and are not , the primary device by which sentences in IndoEuropean languages are given an interrogative form . We have written at some length about questions , yet as will be evident , the last word has by no means been said . A vast field of investigation in the area of interrogation , both in regard to its mechanics and its semantics , still awaits the researcher . The purpose of these remarks has been mainly to indicate potentially profitable lines of investigation suggested by modern linguistics , in contrast to the totally sterile approach of traditional " grammar . "  | COMPLEX SYNTACTIC STRUCTURES Thus far we have been studying the minimum structure required by utterances of various types , if they are not to be identified by the native speaker as incomplete , as failing to communicate anything to Min and leaving him bewildered ? as his behavior would show . This minimum structure , we have seen , is what is commonly called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which the most complex simple utterances can be reduced . And we have presented a technique and a notation for describing and analyzing this structure of the sentence and its components in any language . But , of course , there is no reason at all why a given utterance should consist of one sentence and no more ; there is nothing whatever to prevent a basic pattern from being repeated two or more times within an utterance . If we had to deal with mere repetition of sentence patterns , the end of one and the beginning of the next would no doubt be marked by a distinct juncture , and no special treatment would be required . But there exists here an opportunity , of which languages take advantage in varying degrees , to organize repeated sentence structures within an utterance into a higher level of structure . It is this level of structure that we have now to examine . 1 . The sentence structure as a unit of higher forms Let us designate a sentence structure as S , which will therefore become the symbol for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grammatical structure of any given language . Supposing , then , that we have an utterance like : " He 's badly XI ? COMPLEX SYNTACTIC STRUCTURES   hurt . Get a doctor ! " The formula of analysis for such an utterance will be Si II S2 where the double bar indicates a boundary or juncture . Now , Si here can be analyzed as I-II-IV-III , and S2 as II-I ? ; but we are no longer concerned with the analytical structure at the sentence-level : we take this for granted , since we are taking sentences as units . Should our utterance be of the type : " He went out into the street and hailed a taxicab , " the analytical formula will be only slightly different : S1 ? d3 ? S2 and it will be noted that we count S2 as complete although I is not expressed in it , in accordance with the principle already established ( see Chapter X , 2 ) , that anything just said in one utterance can be counted as part of the one immediately following . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He called to them and they came " would not appear on this level of analysis ( both would be S1 ? d3 ? S2 ) , but would , of course , appear on the basicpattern level , where S2 would in the first case be ( I ) - II- IV , while in the second it would be I-II . At the present level of analysis our concern is to investigate the manner in which Si , S2 , S3 . . . Sn are connected with each other in utterances including more than one ; to establish the patterns of such complexes ? if there is a definite , limited number ? and to determine the nature of the words or forrnants to be identified as d3. 2 . Connective and substitution signals It is evident that the words to which traditional grammar gave the name conjunctions ? co-ordinating or subordinating ? are , in general , identical with the words which we mark as d3 , and thus the symbol d3 will be given to words which could substitute for " and " in the sentences given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet , or , and nor will fall into this category . ' These words express mostly a structural morpheme ? they indicate that the next structure ( whether endocentric or exocentric , whether a sentence component or a complete sentence pattern ) fits into the over-all structure at that level in the same function as the preceding structure . There is , of course , a subordinate message morpheme , accounting for the use of different words with   the same structural function . Thus , d3 can be used either within a sentence or between sentence structures . A question that arises here is whether it is necessary or worth while in English to distinguish between " subordinating " and " co-ordinating " conjunctions . One wonders whether this is a distinction perpetuated by tradition from languages like Latin and German , where the " subordinating " conjunction was followed by a special mood or structure in the following clause . ( Incidentally , the traditional observation that " subordinate clauses are incomplete , while co-ordinate clauses are complete " is specious , for in applying the rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clause following it , while the " subordinating " one is not . If we judged both on the same basis , a clause like " for it was raining " is no more complete than " if I had money . " ) Close investigation fails to substantiate any solid ground for the division into co-ordinating and subordinating conjunctions in English . Possible grounds for distinguishing two types of d3 , however , do appear . Two sentence patterns are often connected by a word like " therefore " or " however , " 2 whose position in the clause it introduces is flexible : it may stand at the beginning or end , or in the middle ; whereas " and , " " but " or " for " may stand only between clauses . Also , words of the " therefore " type may connect only complete sentence patterns , never parts or components of sentence patterns . They seem always to come at a distinct juncture , never to substitute for a juncture . In the case of a pattern like " I have married a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ xiv . 20 ) , however , there is a juncture between S1 and S2 , and it is possible to analyze the utterance as S1 S2 , not identifying the " however " or " therefore " as d3 , but simply as IV within one or the other clause . Since these words are normally bounded by junctures , we might also classify them as interruption structures ( page 189 ) . As a matter of fact , in Indo-European languages , all or almost all connectors between Si and S2 seem to have had some other purpose originally , and to have been adapted to use as conjunctions relatively late in the history of their respective languages . ' It seems probable that Indo-European did not , until late in its history , develop structural organization on the level we are here considering : in other words , normally each utterance contained only one sentence pattern , XI ? COMPLEX SYNTACTIC STRUCTURES   or at most a repetition of two or more divided by junctures . Greek , Latin and Russian often use participles where modern languages would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the style of works in Indo-European languages ? such as those of the Greek Gnomic poets , or the Irish " Red-Branch " legends ? about which there is reason to believe that they might have been first composed at a very remote period . We arrive , therefore , at the conclusion that when Si and S2 occur in sequence , connection between them is made either by juncture ? simply marking a boundary between Sl and S2 ? or by a class of connective words which we shall call d3 ( those which pattern like " and , " " but , " " if , " " when , " and so on ) , or by a combination of both , that is , a juncture followed by a connective word . ( In the written language the last is the normal situation , for a comma is usually put between clauses , but in the spoken language , as observation will testify , the juncture is frequently omitted. ) 3 . Infixation of one S in another If structures are to be made with complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logical process is accumulation ? simply putting one S after another , either with a boundary between the S structures , or with a formant that will either substitute for or supplement the juncture or boundary sign . When there is a boundary , we hardly have what could be called a deliberate structure at all . ' There is a second type of structure , however , which is very common in languages derived from Indo-European : the interruption of one S to present a different S , after which the structure of the first S is concluded ? a situation which gives the following analytical picture : S , . S2 I Si , ( " This man ? I shall call him Smith ? was a criminal " ) , or , Sla d3-S2-I 1-S , b ( " This man , whom I shall call Smith , was a criminal " ; " The person whom you met at the door was my father " ) . Here again , the first sentence is scarcely to be considered a deliberate structure ; only when the connective word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise the S , may be regarded as a mere interruption . In the case of S3a ? d3 ? S , ? Sib , however , we begin to have a distinctive pattern , suitable for cases where S2 gives additional information about ( " modifies " ) a particular word in Si , and it is de- sirable to place it immediately adjacent to that word . The structure becomes even more distinctive when , as frequently in modern English , the d3 is left out : " The course the captain steered . " Here the sequence I-I-Il alerts the hearer to the construction , which can only be S , . ? S2,5 since this particular sequence never occurs as a single sentence pattern ? although the only possible alternatives , I-II-I and I I-I-I ( " Is/your brother/a doctor ? " ) make single sentences . It will be evident that the " infixed " clauses are those traditionally labeled " relative clauses . " In Indo-European languages it is very easy to demonstrate that the " relative pronoun " is a late development . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrative pronouns . The development apparently was somewhat as follows : 1 . I know a man . He is a carpenter . 2 . I know a man . That ( man ) is a carpenter . 3 . I know a man / that is a carpenter . 4 . The man / that is a carpenter / will step forward . When the juncture represented by the period at the end of the first clause in Number 1 and Number 2 is omitted , the demonstrative has assumed the function of the connective . With this kind of construction , S2 can be made to serve most of the functions of I in Si : subject ? " That it is true , is pity " ; genitive ? " We are made aware of the fact that . . . " ; dative ? " I direct your attention to the fact that .. . . " Accusative is handled differently , by the " reduced sentence " structure . 4 . The " reduced sentence " structure The reader may have noticed that we have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterns into one complex sentence in what may have been the order in which they developed . The construction now to be taken up would seem to be the latest and newest ; on the other nand , it may have developed independently , and conceivably be the oldest of all . This structure differs somewhat in different languages , but in general it provides a form in which the elements of a sentence can be put without constituting an independent sentence , so that this " virtual " sentence can be enclosed in another sentence as an endocentric construction . XI ' COMPLEX SYNTACTIC STRUCTURES   Since the functions I-II will make a sentence , it is only necessary to develop a structure that will suggest both I and II and not be a sentence . An ancient example of this structure is the verbal noun or adjective ? the participle , and the constructions in which it figures . In Greek , Latin and Russian these are frequently found where English would have to use a clause : Table There is one limitation to use of the participle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words in a sentence , but the I-morpheme of the implied S , has to be one of the components of S , . We do not , therefore , consider a participial construction a " reduced sentence " in the fullest sense , that is , the reduction of a complete sentence . It is rather a modulation , a case of taking due advantage of an occasion when two structures partly overlap . The genuine reduced sentence is most generally formed with the infinitive , in English marked by the word to , which we shall figure as d ' in this usage . A simple and common example of the construction is the sentence of the type " I want to go " ( I-II-I ? ) , patterning like d ' - II " I want money , " and expressed in some languages by two clauses : " I want it , that I should go . " In this instance , however , the I-function is still taken from S , . When it is different from the I in Si , we get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " which is equivalent to " I want that he should go . " Note that while " I will go " is I-III , - IIb , " I want to go " is I-II-d ' - II . The d ' is used wherever the first verbal form can not be classified as an auxiliary . It is evident that the general strategy of the structure of complex sentences is to take one S as the main one , and work in the direction of giving other S 's some function in the structure of this main clause , or a relationship to some particular word in this main clause . Thus , the structure of complex sentences tends to evolve into patterns similar to those of simple sentences , except that complete sentence patterns , instead of intra-sentence functions ( and words discharging these functions ) , are the units . Within the scope of the present chapter , it is impossible to be much  | more specific than this , since the precise patterns of organization at this level of structure are different in different languages , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have used English for illustration , but have not gone into detail even with that language . 5 . The structure of interruptions and exclamations When a speaker , after beginning an utterance , is interrupted by another speaker , no particular structural problems result insofar as the first speaker is concerned . When the interruption is over , he usually completes the structure he has begun , sometimes repeating the words already uttered , perhaps adding a formula like " As I was saying . " Occasionally , of course , the conversation takes another turn , and the half-finished grammatical structure is forgotten and never completed . The utterance of the speaker who interrupts , however , is by no means always a complete structure . Its structure is , in fact , more often than not irregular ; but this irregularity is understandable in the light of its purpose . Such an utterance is not usually intended to convey information to the first speaker ; if this were the speaker 's intention , it would be more efficient for him to wait until the first speaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The purpose of the interruption , however , is generally to express agreement or disagreement ( hearty or violent , as the case might be ) with what the first speaker is saying , to correct the first speaker , to assure him of the second speaker 's continued attention ? in short , to express the second speaker 's attitude toward what the first speaker is saying . For this , complete grammatical structures may not be necessary . Certain words , such as " Oh ! , " " No ! , " " Yes , " " Uh-huh , " may be confined to such use and may be therefore part of a short , easily mastered list . Certain single adverbials or sentence components , such as " good " ; " too bad " ; may become conventionalized for such contexts . The correction-interruption merely offers one word or structure in place of another , which is either accepted or rejected by the first speaker ; for example : " So I 'll see you at two o'clock  --  " " Three o'clock . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at ) three o'clock , in the . . . " etc.  | " Now , that was in 1932 , and  --  " " Thirty-three . " " No , thirty-two ? in 1932 , and . . . " etc . The interruption aimed at reassuring the first speaker of his hearer 's attention generally consists of such words as " Yes , " " Fine , " " I know , " " I see , " " M-hm , " " Oh ? , " " You do n't say , " " Indeed ? , " " My word , " " What do you know , " s " That 's right , " " Of course , " and others which the reader can easily add , or ascertain by observation . The list would , of course , be quite different for different languages . In French , for example , we might have " Comment ? , " " Ah ? , " " C'est cca " ; in German , " Ach so ? , " " Wunderbar ! , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purpose is the same . ( Frequently noncomparable and dissimilar formants , as between one language and another , express equivalent morphemes in this use , making strict " translation " impossible . French Mon Dieu does not " mean " My God ! ' in English ; it means something like By George ' or Darn ! ' The descriptive linguist does not do his job completely if he merely describes the formants without gaining insight into their functions ? to know which is to penetrate to the heart of the linguistic system under description . ) Sometimes the listener 's close attention is signaled by a repetition of the last word or two just spoken by the other speaker , thus : " So I went to the railway station  --  " " The railway station  --  " " And bought a first-class ticket  --  " " Ticket . " Just as a speaker in a conversation expects and receives periodical signals assuring him of his listener 's continued attention , so he , by a reverse of the same coin , from time to time signals his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of expressions which seem conventional , but which have undergone a semantic shift in order to fulfill this purpose . The message morpheme is totally suppressed in favor of the structural morpheme , to the extent that the formant may be used in a way quite opposite to what it ordinarily means : in these contexts " now " does not mean " at this time , " " then " does not mean " at that time , " and so on .  | This may be regarded as the impingement of the immediate situation on whatever is the subject of the conversation , even when that is something else . When the subject of the conversation is the same as the situation in which it is uttered , there tends to be less impingement . For example : " Pardon me , sir , but can you tell me the way to City Hall ? " " Straight ahead two blocks and turn left . " " Thank you very much . " On the other hand , impingement formants turn up quite regularly in transferred speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to someone else : " Well , I was walking along Main Street , you see , and it did n't look like the City Hall was anywhere around there , so I decided to ask somebody . But it was sure a tough neighborhood , yes sir , and I 'm telling you , I did n't like to stop and talk to anybody , you know ? But along came this fellow , see , and he looked a little more sober than the others , so I decided to take a chance . Well , I asked him politely where City Hall was . Now then , here 's the strangest part of the story . This fellow , you see ... " In the same category can be put exclamatory interruptions like : " My ! How pretty , " " It was , Oh ! So sad , " " Ah , so pure , " " Mm ! That 's good , " and so on . These are all designed to signify to a listener the emotional attitude of the speaker , whether or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his speech . This is probably why exclamations are normally structured as interruptions , and of all the material of language , frequently can not be shown to have been derived from fuller forms . ( This may yet be accomplished , however : exclamations vary with language ? and are therefore evidently learned behavior , not universal human reactions ; as Kipling pointed out long ago , ' even the syllables we use for sobbing or laughing are different in different cultures ? and sometimes seem to follow the development of a language ; ' yet , on the other hand , they often use sounds which are not phonemes in the speaker 's language . ) Traditional grammar , of course , made no distinction between immediate and transferred speech , and treated practically none of the topics discussed in this chapter . This is why a student who has learned  | a language by the traditional method sounds so artificial when he tries to talk it , and ? until the methods of linguistic description are improved ? can acquire real ease and Sprachgefiihl only after more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE STRUCTURE OF WORDS ( MORPHOLOGY ) Etymologically , the word morphology means " the science of forms " ( the German equivalent is Formenlehre ) , and it has not infrequently been used to mean the description of all the phenomena of a language other than ( 1 ) the order of words in a sentence or clause , and of clauses in a sentence , ( 2 ) the inventory of words in the language ( the lexicon ) . This point of view arose at a time when the only languages thoroughly studied by philologists were of the Indo-European family and were structured similarly to Latin and Greek : they definitely had wordunits , and a majority of the grammatical structure was included in the composition of the word . Modern linguistics must necessarily restrict this definition to narrower limits and for the most part exclude those devices ? whether formants , patterns of order , or intonation curves ? which give structure and meaning to utterances ; in other words , we wish to treat grammatical structure of the language ( what corresponds to the traditional term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have done in Chapters VIII to XI ) . This leaves morphology concerned only with the principles of structure of wordunits . ' In traditional grammar , morphology had become largely a listing of inflectional formants in logical groupings or " paradigms . " We are less concerned with devising groupings for " endings " than with ascertaining how the word-unit is made up . We shall divide words into formants , see if the formants fall into notable categories , and endeavor to find out the principles governing the selection and order of formants within the word .   It once was thought that all languages have words , that " words " and " language " were synonymous terms . But with the growth of our acquaintance with languages which do not have words ( in the sense that in these languages , every distinct group of syllables is as much a sentence as a word ) have come the questions , why do languages have words ? Which is suggestive of a higher stage of linguistic evolution , to have words or not to have them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we can make a confident surmise as to why languages have words . If we dictate to a group of persons who are asked to write down exactly what they hear a single meaningless syllable of possible occurrence in their native language , all or nearly all will produce an exact transcription of what was dictated . Approximately the same thing will occur with two or three syllables , though individual phonemes may ( in the absence of meaning ) be misidentified by various individuals in the group . But with four or more syllables it will become evident that our subjects not only can not record the syllables accurately , but can not even be sure how many there were . Now , if at this point the matter of dictation be shifted to words meaningful in the language of the listeners , we shall find that four , five , even seven or eight syllables can be accurately transcribed ; and in fact , if the person conducting the experiment purposely makes small errors ? saying , for instance , " fackpory " instead of " factory " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been , and insist that that is what they heard . Evidently , the existence of unit boundaries and a principle of organization , and of a semantic reference for each component , is a great aid to the memory . This is no doubt why we have words . The more there is to express in an utterance , the more formants , naturally , are required . If these become numerous and result in a very long string of syllables , it may become difficult for the hearer to keep track of them . Hence , it would appear that the development of a structural unit which may be called a " word " would suggest a later rather than an earlier stage in the development of language from its beginnings , though many disagree . The difficulty of remembering a long string of syllables , even with the help of words organized according to well-known principles , es- pecially for the ignorant mind , still has its influence : it will be found that in most languages there is a distinct tendency for the spoken language and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " words of one syllable " ? three or four at most ; while the language of the learned is proverbially polysyllabic. 2 . The identity of the word The spelling systems of most modern languages call for the separation , in writing or printing , of words from each other by the use of spaces between them . It is perfectly obvious , however , that we make no such division in the spoken language . To the keen inquirer , therefore , the question might occur : since in actual speech we utter formants in a continuous sequence without division , do we really have words at all ? The question is a good one insofar as it springs from a disposition to be realistic about language ? an understanding that the spoken syllables are the language , not an imperfect and possibly " corrupted " reproduction of the written forms . But actually , although apparently pauses are used only for syntactic boundaries , and although there might be argument about whether a given formant or sequence of formants is " free " in the sense of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction that most languages have word-units . For one thing , an accent , always occurring on the first , or last , or nextto-last syllable of the word , may fix the word 's boundaries ( this is probably the original reason for word accent ) . Sequences of phonemes inadmissible between syllables of a word will often be admitted between words . In languages where the structure of the word is " root + endings , " it is easy to recognize a new word when a new root appears . Of course , here and there a word boundary may become obscured , as in such cases as orange , apron , adder . ' It might be mentioned that while a word must be at least one formant , and a formant is normally at least one syllable , there are such things as nonsyllabic words ( the formant being only one or two phonemes ) . Many of the Slavic languages have prepositions which consist of a single consonant , and are , of course , pronounced as part of the next word : v means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nonsyllabic words are necessarily " enclitic " or " proclitic " : an enclitic is pronounced 1 3 ? Patterns of word structure : compounds   as part of the preceding word , a proclitic as part of the following word . Even words of one or more syllables may sometimes be enclitic or proclitic ; Latin , for example , had an enclitic word for " and , " - que , seen in senatus populusque Romanus , instead of senatus et populus Romanus . ) Surprisingly enough , even English provides examples of enclitic words : such words as would and am are often eroded in conversation to d and m : I 'd like to know ; I 'm not going ; my brother 'd come . Problems that are much less easily disposed of concern whether a given sequence of formants , used sometimes with one semantic reference and sometimes with a different one , is one word or a pair of homophones , or whether a given word and one differing from it only slightly , the difference expressing only syntactic function ( e.g. , serous vs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one word or two . But these problems belong to the special field of lexicography ( see Chapter 14 ) . 3 . Patterns of word structure : compounds We may venture the speculation that , when the word-unit was first discovered , its organization was planless and purely accidental : a limit may have been arbitrarily placed after every third or fourth formant . n languages as we know them today , however , the formants making up a word are never placed by chance , but always according to definite patterns . These patterns differ somewhat according to the structural type to which the language belongs , but many agree in a general way in placing formants which express message morphemes first , followed by formants expressing structural morphemes . The order of formants in polysynthetic languages is , of course , outside the scope of morphology , since the principles to which it responds are those of sentence construction , and the patterns formed are essentially sentence patterns . In the case of the other three types of languages , we can often justly regard the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the root . The formants that follow , expressing operational instructions , or modifications of the basic information , may be called , in the agglutinative languages , postpositions ; in the inflecting and analytic languages , suffixes . In the case of analytic languages , we shall expect to see fewer endings , more words containing a root only , and more " structural words " ? independent words expressing little or no message information , but serving almost exclusively as operation indicators .   The principle of organization of a word tends to be identical with the history of its development , as far as this latter can be surmised : a word like undisciplined presupposes disciplined , which in turn presupposes discipline ? and , to take a step into history , Latin disciplina presupposes disco and doceo . If words are analyzed with due regard to the layers of accretion of immediate constituents ( see Chapter VIII , 6 ) , principles of morphological structure will more readily appear . Going somewhat contrary to Bloomfield , ' we do not assert that the root of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that language ( we need only cite legitimate English words like bellicose ) , ' although presumably it must have at some time been a word in some language , and it would appear probable that , if it has been borrowed en bloc from another language , the root is not likely to be productive , in the sense that other derivatives will be made from it . ( In etymology ? see Section 7 ? this is often a clue that the history of a word can not be traced in the language where it is first encountered . ) It is best , it would seem , to define " the root " as those formants which carry the message information of the word . Often a word which , like bellicose , or retain , detain , conceive , can be divided into formants in another language or on a historical and etymological basis , must count as a single root from the point of view of the language under study . ' It seems likely that at some stage of the development of language , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contains nothing that is not part of the root ? as is still the case in languages of certain structural types . Even in languages where this is the prevailing situation , however , this is rarely true in all cases . It will often appear from commutation that the root consists of two or more elements which can occur as independent words . In this case we say that the word is compound . Compounding is one of the chief means at the disposal of a language to increase its stock of words , and in the inflecting and analytic languages ? where the structure of the word is relatively inflexible , and one is expected to meet the expressive requirements of a given situation by using established words , not by creating an ad hoc agglomeration of formants ? new vocabulary is always being formed while the language remains living . Long ago the Hindu grammarians made a very thorough classification of compound words in Sanskrit , ' and most of the categories which they established can be identified in most other languages , 3 ? Patterns of word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English , a series of words like animal tamer , snub-nosed , hearthstone and gooseberry demonstrate the three stages of the formation of a compound word : the group of words regularly used together ; the hyphenated group , or group written and accented as one word ; lastly , the compound formed so long ago that , though it is recognized as a compound , one element of it has become meaningless . Compounds in all the stages may be found in the English of any given period , since the process is constantly going on . It appears that almost any grammatical structure can be taken as a word and as the compound root of derived words : witness expressions like " the take-it-or-leave-it attitude , " where position changes a whole sentence into III , or " It has a je ne sais quoi about it , " in which a sentence in another language is made I. We have noun compounds developed from III-I ( blackbird , bluejay , hothouse , electric shaver ) , from IV-I ( dishpan , i.e. , pan for dishes ; homework @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i.e. , buggy for a baby ) ; from I-I representing a sentence nucleus , I ? - II ( animal tamer , i.e. , tamer of animals , one who tames animals ; office seeker , i.e. , seeker of office , one who seeks office ) ; from IIa IIb taken as I ( take-off , markup , blowout , count-down ) , and so on . Needless to say , a black bird is entirely distinct from a blackbird ? and a hot house is not necessarily a hothouse . A baby buggy may be a small buggy ( just as a baby grand piano is a small piano ) as well as a buggy for babies . The most common compounding pattern in the Indo-European languages , however , is the simple juxtaposition of two nouns , the first modifying the second : a doghouse is a kind of house , not a kind of dog . Compound adjectives are also frequent , e.g. , flap-eared , three-cornered ( representing III-I plus the participial suffix - ed giving adjectival function ) , stone-ground ( representing IV-III , " ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moreover , any compound word may in turn become one of the constituents of another compound , yielding almost limitless possibilities : cf. back-seat driver , home loan office ; here determination of the immediate constituents is of the utmost importance , since evidently a " back II seat 1 Idriver " is not " a driver of seats who is in back " ( back Iseatl driver ) , and a " homer loan I office " is " an office for home loans , " not " a loan office at home . " Some languages pursue the possibilities in this direction a good deal further than English ; the celebrated propensity of German for compounding ' is often partly a spelling convention ( German would write office seeker as one   word ) , but something like **36;146;TOOLONG , " a law for the indemnification of war prisoners , " proves that the reputation is not altogether undeserved. 4 . Derived words After we have separated out , in a word under analysis , those formants which convey message morphemes and , among the latter , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , the remaining formants , all bound forms , will fall into two categories : derivative prefixes , infixes or suffixes ; and inflectional " endings . " The former are still part of the message information , but are clearly secondary : they are mainly intended to effect slight modifications in the information conveyed by the root , and thereby to elicit new words from a word already formed . The inflectional formants , on the other hand , are intended to give the word a role in a grammatical pattern and to fit it in with other words . Of course , these two purposes not infrequently overlap in a given formant . To illustrate , in English the word book has only one formant , which is the root . The form books contains an additional formant -s , which is both derivative and inflectional : it adds the information that we are speaking about more than one book , but also serves to tie this word with other words ? with plural verbs , adjectives , and so on . A word like bookbinder is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another derived word , bind-er ) of the type I-I for Ie-II ( see above , Section 3 ) . Finally , a word like bookbindery is a derivative of bookbinder ; they formant expresses the note of " place where a trade is carried on , " hence , the bookbinder 's shop ( in these last three words we have expressed by an independent word , " shop , " what the derivative suffix -y expresses in bookbindery ) . Many who recite Longfellow 's The Village Blacksmith do not realize that the " smithy " is not the smith , but the place where he works . In a phrase like the bookbindery 's machinery , we have another formant -s , which is inflectional ; it does not modify the meaning of bookbindery , as -y alters that of bookbindery and machinery . This is a typical inflectional suffix . Naturally , these are less frequent in the analytical languages . Derivative formants may be included in a word anywhere , but to   put them before the root undermines the identity of the word ; nevert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Indo-European there appears to have been a time when the word always began with the toot and was accented on the first syllable . Then , particularly among verbs , new words were derived by prefixed formants ( which , it seems , originally just happened to precede the verb in the sentence ) : stand , withstand , understand ; capio , incipio , recipio . Immediately the problem arose : should the word-accent be moved to the first syllable ? which would take it off the root and possibly cause elimination , through cont raction , of that vital syllable ? or should the accent remain on the root , which would keep the compounding process clear but would remove a useful indication of the beginning of the word ? Germanic appears to have at first followed the latter practice ( giving the inseparable-prefix verbs ) , then , more recently , the former ( whence the separable-prefix verbs ) . Latin appears to have stuck with initial accent at first ( whence the vowel reduction in the root - cap-  seen in incipio ) , then shifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefix one formant without shifting the accent from the root , but would shift the accent if two or more were prefixed ? which led to many " irregular " forms in which the original root was altogether lost . What may be called " infixes " were much less used , yet one or two illustrations can be found in many languages . Some Greek roots ( e.g. , Aa/3 , take ' ) infix an - m-  in the present tense ( Xa ? /3-av-w ) . Latin ( also Greek ) has several examples of an infixed - sc-  : ignosco vs. ignotus , etc . Infixes may not be intentional ; in some cases , they arise when part of the original root drops out in certain forms because of phonetic developments . 5 . Root , stem and ending When we have analyzed a word into formants and determined the succession of immediate constituents , we ultimately come to a form which is not further divisible ( from a contemporary point of view , at least ) , ' and appears to be the original base from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ancient metaphor , as the root , to which forms are added either at the beginning or at the end : e.g. , if " drive " is our root , " overdrive " is an example of adding at the beginning , while " drive/s , " " driv/ing , " " driv/er , " " driv/er , ' s " are   examples of addition at the end . Besides these , " drove " is an example of an internal-change formant ; and " drive-in , " " drive home , " exam- pies of a discontinuous formant ( i.e. , two formants , expressing one morpheme , which do not occur together within a word , but as two at least potentially independent words , which may have other words in between ) . The root is frequently a word in its own right , but not necessarily . Underlying legal , legality , illegal , is a root - leg-  which is not in use because we already have the word law . The term " prefix " is generally suitable for formants attached at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those added after ; but not all formants preceding or following the root can properly be called by those names . Only if the subordination of these formants to the rootformant is very evident ? as , for example , when they express mainly or exclusively structural morphemes ? are the traditional terms applicable in their fullest sense . In a word like " car-wash , " the formant wash is not a suffix ; but in " washer , " - er is a suffix . When endings are added to a root , analysis may reveal a formant which seems to express little except to vary the form of the root for combination . In a word like " political , " we have clearly two formants , one of which is also seen in " politic/s , " " impolitic , " and similar forms . But in " politico-legal , " the root form has been expanded by a syllable to " politico- , " apparently solely for the sake of combination . Again , the infinitives of Latin verbs fall into four types , as shown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In these forms we can clearly distinguish - re as the sign of the infinitive , and the roots voc- , hab- , dicand ven- ( seen in such other words as vox , habilis , dixit , conventio ) . But what about the vowel between the root and the various endings ? Have we four types of infinitive ( four " conjugations " : - are , - ere , - ere and - ire ) , or one infinitive ending - re , and four stems , voca- , habe- , dice- , and veni- ? The latter is the more efficient statement of the facts . ( Needless to say , the traditional one is the former . ) It is conventional to describe the evident facts in a language like Latin to say that inflectional endings are normally added to the stem , which is derived from the root . Actually , it is probably more correct to say that because of various accidents in a language 's historical development , the commutation process can be carried further in some words than in others ? giving alternative forms of the root @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the root ) . There is use for the concept of a " stem , " i.e. , the root plus a formant which adds nothing to the mes- sage and little to the structure , but puts the root into a form suitable for combination . The value of abstraction of the " stem vowel " as a separate entity may , however , be questionable : beloved of grammarians , it makes for neat paradigms , but it is doubtful whether it reflects actual relationships in the language . 6 . Inflections , " agreement " and correlative words From what has already been said , the nature of the type of formants traditionally called " inflectional endings " will be clear . They are those whose chief , if not only purpose is to fit the word in which they occur into the grammatical structure of the language . Thus , they indicate whether the word is I , II , III or IV , whether it is subject or object in the sentence in which it occurs , whether it is part of an endocentric structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same class . Naturally , inflectional formants are most numerous and most complex in the " inflecting " languages . There are certain message morphemes which are usually expressed by these formants simultaneously with their structural meaning . Thus , having identified a word as I , they may also indicate that more than one item of the species named by the word is under discussion . Having identified it as II , they indicate the time of occurrence or character of the action designated by the word . Finally , there are certain structural functions of inflectional formants , not necessary for the grammatical structure , not adding anything to the message , often of apparently accidental origin , yet persistent and stable to a high degree . Grammatical gender , for example , appears to have arisen simply because pronouns , with forms for different sorts of referents , were used to avoid repetition of nouns . ( A classification into animate and inanimate beings might be logical , and indeed seems to peek through here and there in the Indo-European system ; but it is , we trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with grammatical " gender , " which often arbitrarily makes inanimate objects male or female , and sometimes makes obviously feminine beings neuter . ) So-called " plural " forms of verbs by no means indicate any notion of plurality in the action named by the verb , but rather in the subject of the verb . It appears that the functions which these features must discharge in those languages which use them must be to tie together , to mark as   belonging together the words belonging to certain important exocentric or endocentric constructions . If the terminal syllables of the verb ? even after its verbal character , its aspect and its tense have been signaled ? vary in response to the terminal syllables of the noun which is its subject , this certainly constitutes an additional mark for the I-II structure , and very clearly singles out among nouns in the nominative case which one is I for the structure . If the adjective in III-I varies certain syllables according to the " gender " of I , it helps to mark off the words constituting the III-I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we prefer to call it , " bonding " ? apparently grew up by accident in the Indo-European languages at a time when they were highly inflectional , and probably because of the habit of such languages of expressing two or three morphemes by the same formant . In an analytic or agglutinating language , if it was thought necessary to indicate that the subject of the verb was female , this morpheme could be indicated by a formant included in the subject-word ; but this morpheme probably would not be expressed again in the verb . In an inflecting language , however , the " gender " morpheme would be included in one formant with others which it was necessary for the verb to have . Though not absolutely necessary , " bonding " was found useful for the reasons given above , and it often was preserved for a long time . It is because of this high morpheme-formant ratio that inflecting languages are particularly subject to crystallization of inflectional formants into rigid systems , the " declensions " and " conjugations " so well known in traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon very cursory inspection that these are very tautological and uneconomical , and therefore highly inefficient . One syllable is used to express the dative in the singular , a different one to express the dative in the plural , two more to express the same distinction in " feminine gender , " and an additional quartet of endings for each of three or four " declensions . " ( Most " paradigms " could be greatly abridged , to be sure , by recognizing syncretism in tabulation , rather than listing the same form under four or five different headings , thereby asserting a distinction which does not actually exist ; but a good deal of inefficiency would still remain . ) A language more sparing of effort and more economical of resources would ? short of the limit set by the possibility of ambiguity ? express a given morpheme only once or twice ,   always by the same formant . It is , therefore , no accident that inflect ional languages develop in the direction of analytic . Noting that rigid systems of xM:f and xf:M* are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty inefficient even there , it seems quite amazing that for such a long period it was thought that these alone were the tools of grammatical structure : that to give a language 's declensions and conjugations was to give its " grammar , " and conversely , if one had to admit with embarrassment that one could not set these up for a language , the language was obviously barbarous and had no coherent structure . Similar to " bonding " formants are correlative words , which occur as members of pairs , so that the occurrence of one of the pair alerts the listener for the appearance of the other . In this manner two words , two endocentric structures , or two full sentence structures ( clauses ) may be balanced or related to each other . In English , well-known examples are : Table The correlation effect is not in the grammatical function of these words ( all can be classified in categories containing other words not correlative ) , nor is it signaled by any special formant . The correlation resides in the fact that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is correlative , and the word that is correlative to it . This morpheme , in other words , is an example of a structural morpheme not formally expressed , the words involved being part of a limited list ( see VIII , 5 ) . 7 . The history of the word ( etymology ) One of the most fascinating branches of linguistic science is etymology , whose task is to ascertain the origin and history of the words used in any language . The etymologist is a linguistic detective : he seeks to discover , if he can , when and how each word came into being , and   how it came to have the form and meaning which it has today . The course of this investigation often turns up a veritable treasure-trove of unrecorded history , forgotten trades and traditions , the ways and conditions of life of other days , and choice archeological finds . Thus , etymology tells us that copper was supplied to the ancient world principally from the island of Cyprus , and probably at least as early as 800 B.C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and copper was simply " the Cyprian metal , " cuprum aes ) . From etymology we learn that the Gauls whom Caesar fought wore clan tartans , as do their modern descendants : Caesar refers to them as braccatae gentes , i.e. , people who wore trousers ( since the Romans did not , they considered the practice barbarous ) , and braccae ? whence Scots breeks , English breeches and French braies ? was a Celtic word , evidently identical with Old Irish brecc , " varicolored , " and modern Scottish breacan , " the kilt . " The words calico and damask tell us that these types of cloth originated in Calcutta and Damascus respectively . One aspect of the etymologist 's work is historical . Ideally , he would like to find out exactly when a given word was first coined and everything that has happened to it since then . This is possible with only a minority of words , since a language inherits the bulk of its wordstock from earlier stages of itself and ultimately from a parent language , and somewhere along that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some words , indeed , might have an unbroken lineage back to the beginning of speech , if only we had the evidence to trace it . On the other hand , we know almost the precise moment of the birth of the word gerrymander ' ? and the approximate time of origin of such words as okay , shyster , to pan out , bedlam . Much of the flavor of the style of , say , Addison , comes from the absence in his writing of words which came into English after his time . It is surprising that scholars have not taken this into account in their criticism of such authors ; but those trained in the literature of any language seem generally to have little or no interest in the language itself . The importance of historical research in serious etymology can not be too highly stressed . The very first thing that must be done , before attempting to theorize on the origin of a word , is to secure all available information on the changes of form and usage it has undergone since its first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etymology   of the word savage , we might go off on the wrong track altogether if we did not observe that the contemporary French form sauvage suggests an l in the word . In the sixteenth century , we find , it was actually written selvage in English . Italian selvaggio then confirms our suspicion that we may postulate a Late Latin form *silvaticus ( from silva ) meaning " one who lives in the forest . " Similarly , the word aisle would present an insoluble problem until we discovered that the s was int roduced into the spelling by analogy with the homophone isle ( where the s was not pronounced either ) : then we realize that aile was a simple borrowing from French ? retaining in English , however , the Old French pronunciation ? and meaning " a wing " ( on either side of the " nave " ) . The absence of the documents , and of facilities for easy access to them , required for this kind of investigation resulted in the fact that really scientific etymology was impossible until the nineteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its origin , at what point can we consider an etymology complete ? On this , policy is not clearly defined . Judging by the practice of most etymologists , if the word is ultimately from Indo-European , one likes to develop if possible a plausible reconstruction of the Indo-European root ; otherwise one tries to trace the word at least as far back as the point where it entered the language under investigation . To do this often requires , not only a mastery of several languages , but a fairly intimate knowledge of the linguistic history of each , in order to be able to decide how to account for the changes of form recorded for the word , and what sort of original root can be judiciously postulated . It is here the philological side of etymology comes to the fore . Like linguistic science as a whole , etymology requires arduous training and compendious knowledge if its results are to be more than mere ingenious , or even learned guesswork . When pursued by scholars adequately qualified , however , etymology makes rich and often spectacular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ languages which serve both to unite and to divide us.  | THE PHYSICAL ELEMENT IN LANGUAGE ( PHONETICS ) The " compleat linguist " ( to paraphrase Izaak Walton ) must study and master all that properly belongs to linguistics in the realm of observable physical phenomena , and , indeed , he should know enough about the physical sciences upon which linguistics impinges to take advantage of discoveries made and machines invented by acoustical engineers . ( For a description of the basic division of the phenomena embraced by the study of language see Chapter I , 4 , and Figure 5 . ) Although these topics come within the scope of the science of phonetics , which has an identity of its own , certain branches of it may be considered as branches of linguistic science , and we venture the proposal that every student who hopes to win a worthy place in the professional field of linguistics must be an accomplished phonetician. 1 . Outline of the history of phonetics At the end of the nineteenth century the study of the sounds of which speech is made up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preposterous notions and the wildest stupidities ? finally adopted scientific method and soon emerged as a recognized physical science . The first real phonetician was probably Wolfgang von Kempelen ( 1734-1804 ) ; but he was far ahead of his time , and his adventure with a " chess-playing machine " which turned out to be a hoax discredited all of his perfectly sound work , as had happened more than a century before to Father Athanasius Kircher . ' Nevertheless , Von Kempelen 's Mechanismus der menschlichen Sprache ( 1791 ) is the first really serious and responsible attempt to describe the sounds of speech . Almost half a century after Von Kempelen , J. Muller 's Hand- buch der Physiologie ( 2 v. , Coblenz , 1834-40 ) , not intended for the study of language , nevertheless gave attention to the physiology of the speech process , thus laying some of the groundwork for the soonto-be-born science . A mid-nineteenth-century effort toward attempting to improve traditional orthography ? which , of course , amounted to a search for a phonetic alphabet ? also served to prepare the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alphabet ( London , 1863 ) . The first serious work in what we now call phonetics , however , was E. Brucke 's Grundzuge der Physiologie and Systematik der Sprachlaute ( Vienna , 1856 ) . Brucke was a physiologist , but in this work he established the limits of scope of the new field . He was followed by Eduard Sievers , whose Grundzuge der Lautphysiologie went through several editions . In this branch of linguistics , however , the French took the lead around the turn of the century , and the names of the abbe Rousselot ( Principes de phonetique experimentale , Paris , 1897-1909 ) , Paul Passy , founder of the International Phonetic Association , and a little later , Maurice Grammont ( Traite de phonetique , Paris , 1933 ) , are all still well known . The influence of their work is seen in American and English grammars of French , which for several decades were alone among foreign-language grammars in starting the elementary textbook with a short course in phonetics . It was believed that this would greatly help the American or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of French ; and so it would have done , had it not generally doubled the student 's hatred for a subject which required him to break his head on phonetics in addition to the foreign language . The early twentieth-century French work in phonetics awakened similar interest in the subject in England . George Bernard Shaw 's character in Pygmalion , Professor Higgins , was probably suggested by Henry Sweet ( 1849-1912 ) ; and Sweet 's best-known follower was Daniel Jones , author of many of the most distinguished works on phonetics in English . 2 . The two branches of phonetics Until well into the twentieth century phonetics continued to be most nearly allied to physiology , and the sounds of speech were described and named according to the organs producing them and the  | position of these organs in relation to surrounding structures . The terminology devised to designate the sounds of speech reflects this stage , and it is still largely physiological . From the point of view of teaching , it was taken for granted that an accurate description of the sound 's articulation would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the development of physics , however , and especially of acoustics , it became possible to describe sounds-with great discrimination from the physicist 's point of view ? that is , as a wave motion . As usual in science , the analytic process was followed by synthesis : physicists found themselves able to produce speech sounds by machines and by electric currents ? sounds which , if not entirely identical with those produced by human organs , could be identified and transcribed as such . ' It was also demonstrated that even the human organs of speech could produce the sound-units of a given language from positions other than those customarily adopted , as long as the acoustic effect ? i.e. , the shape of the resulting sound waves ? was the same . As a result of the developments in physics , therefore , we have now two different techniques with which to study the sounds used in human speech , according as we wish to describe them from one point of view or the other . Each technique is entirely valid , and each leads to certain discoveries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching are found in both : it has been suggested that , utilizing principles of acoustic phonetics , machines could be constructed to analyze the model acoustically and also the student 's imitation , compare the two , and advise the student by a light or buzz whether his imitation is close enough to be acceptable . Obviously , the thoroughly trained linguist must understand and be able to manipulate both techniques . We shall , therefore , proceed to give an outline , first , of the articulatory or physiological approach to the description of speech sounds , and second , of the acoustic phonetician 's view of the same matter . 3 . A sketch of articulatory phonetics It has often been pointed out that man does not , in the strictest sense , have " organs of speech , " since all the organs used by man in  | speaking have at least one other function which seems more fundamental , such as breathing and eating . Thus , the act of speech begins with inhalation ( often the drawing in of breath by a person is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it , " he took a deep breath and launched into a tirade of abuse , " etc . ) . The stock of air thus accumulated is expelled through the trachea , or windpipe , and the larynx which is at the top of it ( Fig. 28 ) . Thus far breathing is not different from speaking . The distinction lies mainly in what happens to the air when it reaches the larynx . If it is allowed to pass through without interference we have breathing or " respiration . " Any interference with the passage of the air is likely to produce noise ; and that noise is probably a speech sound in some language . It is the tensile vocal cords in the larynx which in the first instance XIII ? THE PHYSICAL ELEMENT IN LANGUAGE ( PHONETICS ) 3 ? A sketch of articulatory phonetics   determine the amount and type of interference with the air stream , and thus modulate it for speech . If they are left completely relaxed , the air passes through without producing a sound . If they are somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if they are tensed still further , their vibration produces a musical tone which is the individual 's voice . Either voice or whisper is modulated , in ways to be described , into discriminate units making up the sound system of the language . Before going into detail in this direction , however , we may mention that the voice as produced in the larynx would not be audible enough for practical speech unless reinforced by several resonance chambers , chiefly the mouth , the nasal passage , and the sinuses ? just as the tones of a violin string would be inaudible without the box to reinforce it . ( Thus , it is literally true that one could not carry on speech without the help of the " holes in his head . " ) The particular shape and acoustic properties of these cavities ( which can be studied as phenomena of physics ) determine the precise quality of each person 's voice , ' which generally sounds higher to its owner than to others , because he hears it partially by conduction through the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cords can be completely closed to stop off momentarily all air from the lungs ; and the sound heard immediately after the release of this stoppage is called in phonetics the glottal stop . It is not infrequently used ? for one purpose or another ? in languages of whose sound system it is not a member ( cf. English , in some dialects of which it substitutes for t , e.g. , bole , for bottle , ' ba2le , lihl , and in which it is often used for separation , e.g. , Pe-Tor-2i-2a ) ; and it is a regular unit in the sound systems of many languages , notably those in the Semitic family . ' The whisper sound , too , is also used as a phoneme in many languages ? it is familiar in English as the sound of h ? and also occurs in languages in which it is not a phoneme : Italian , for instance , like other Romance languages , has no h , yet it is possible for a native speaker of Italian to say ho . There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to designate sounds produced in the larynx , generally by adjustments of the vocal cords ) , the so-called " voiced h " which has been a subject of con- troversy inasmuch as it would seem a priori impossible that h ( breathing ) and voice could be produced simultaneously ; nevertheless , some languages have a phoneme which it seems difficult to describe otherwise . We shall not go into the matter here . Note that it is customary to write phonetic transcriptions , or sounds which have been analyzed phonetically , within square brackets , . Some languages have sounds produced by contractions of the pharynx , the area between the larynx and the root of the tongue : for examples , we may cite Arabic ' ain and its voiced counterpart ? usually written and gh in transcriptions , but frequently unsounded in many contemporary Semitic dialects , including Palestinian Hebrew . What the " laryngeal theory " ( see Chapter IV , Note 15 ) refers to as " laryngeals " may have been pharyngeals , if they ever existed as actual speech sounds . The majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , are either oral or nasal ? that is , they are produced by interference with the stream of air by organs within either the mouth or the nasal passage ? the cavity which extends behind the nose and connects with the pharynx . The pharynx can be closed off at will from the nasal cavity by the velum , or " soft palate , " and normally is ; but when the velum is lowered , the resonance of the nasal passage is added to that produced in the mouth , and so we can have nasalized as well as nasal sounds . Among the oral sounds ( and , in a sense , among the nasal ones also ; we shall see the qualification presently ) a basic distinction is between vowels and consonants . The distinction is essentially a matter of duration and sonority ; the sounds we classify as " vowels " are louder , contain much more energy , and last many times longer than those which fall into the " consonant " classification . The most characteristically consonantal sounds are what we call " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , either by the lips ( labial stops ) , by the tip of the tongue ( dental stops ) , or by the base of the tongue ( velar stops ) . These are , evidently , incapable of having more than momentary duration . The most characteristically vocalic sounds are the well-known " cardinal vowels , " a , e , o , u , produced by different positions of the tongue within the mouth ? in no case , however , effecting much interference with the passage of air .   The vowels are of literally hundreds of times longer duration than most of the consonantal sounds . Midway between the two extremes , however , the line between vowels and consonants becomes much harder to draw ; certain sounds are regarded as consonants in one language , as vowels in another . It seems , in fact , that a vowel can not be defined in relation to consonants in terms of absolute duration ; the distinction between them becomes a phonemic matter ( see the next chapter ) . Within the realm of consonants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important consonants of a majority of languages ? simply because it pretty well covers the possibilities of distinct articulations . This basic pattern takes the following shape : Table We have already seen that stoppage of air can be effected in three maximally distinct locations : by the lips , by the tip of the tongue , and by the elevated back of the tongue . In each of these positions there can be effected a simple stoppage , a stoppage accompanied by voice , and a stoppage accompanied by voice and lowering of the velum , which last , of course , causes the resonance to come wholly from the nasal passage . The uninitiated do not suspect the close relationship existing among the sounds in the vertical columns of Figure 29 , but the reader may try reading aloud a passage containing many m 's , n 's and ng 's while holding his nose as if it were " stuffed up , " and see if they do not all come out b 's , d 's and g 's ( " I thigk I'be sufferig frob a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered speech there should be no difference between p 's and b 's , and in unfamiliar words they probably would be confused ; but in ordinary whispered conversation , we use means ? too complicated to detail here ? for preserving the distinction . The various directions in which this basic rectangle of consonants can be expanded may be left for a fuller outline or for more advanced  | study in phonetics . Suffice it to say that such distinctions as variation in point of articulation ( t/t ) , 5 aspiration ( p/ph , etc. ) , ' palatalization ( k/k ' , etc. ) ' and affrication ( t/t ) $ may be introduced to elicit up to approximately twenty phonemes from this basic set of modes and locations of articulation . The consonants in Figure 29 are all stop consonants . For all but the nasal ones , a spirant articulation is also possible . We have spirant articulation when the contact of organs ( e.g. , tongue and roof of mouth ) which , when complete , produces a stop , is not quite complete . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air used in speaking is forced through under pressure , producing a sort of hissing or hushing sound ; the spirant corresponds to the stop which would have been produced if the stoppage had been made . Thus , the ch sound of German ( or of Scottish och aye ! ) is the spirant of the sound represented in English by the letter k . Besides those corresponding to stops , quite a few other spirant articulations are possible . The shape of the slit or groove through which the air passes here assumes considerable importance , giving acoustic character to the sounds produced . Thus , groove spirants are s or f sounds , lateral fricatives are 1 sounds . ' Most of the spirants , like the stops , may be either voiceless or voiced.10 Sometimes a language does not make use of an articulatory possibility because it is relatively hard to hear . Thus , the spirant 0 , corresponding to the stop p , is the sound one makes when blowing out a match . In many languages the /f/ phoneme has this articulation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other languages a spirant comprising voiceless friction ? not between the lips , but between upper teeth and lower lip ? has been substituted , because it is much more audible . Consonants so articulated are called labiodentals ; English f and v belong to this class . A final type of consonant articulation is the trill . In this case we have a rapidly repeated articulation , or an extremely rapid alternation of two similar articulations . The most noteworthy is the r of most European languages , which is actually a rapidly repeated d.12 It is used in the Scottish dialect of English , and is often called " the Scots burr . " ( The r used by most Americans is quite a different sound , however , which might well be considered a vowel . ) Other ex- amples of trills are the French r , for which the uvula is rapidly vibrated , and the so-called " Bronx cheer , " which is essentially a labial trill ? a rapidly repeated p . All the articulations mentioned so far modulate air proceeding from the lungs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articulation ) . As in playing the harmonica , it is also possible to produce at least some distinct sounds by drawing air into the mouth ( implosive articulation ) . This is the mode of articulation of the exotic clicks of Hottentot and other rare languages . ( Oddly enough , however , all the Hottentot clicks are used in English , though as exclamations , not sounds of speech : the one corresponding to 1 is used to speed up horses ; that corresponding to t as a sign of disapproval , often written tck-tck , tsk-tsk , tch-tch , and so on . Finally , the labial implosive is nothing other than a kiss ! Naturally , in countries where this is a sound of speech , it can not be used for a sign of affection ? and in those countries , the gesture of affection is nose-rubbing . ) It is hoped that , with what has been said ? brief as it is ? the reader will be able to understand the organization of the chart of phonetic symbols set forth in Figure 30 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sounds not dealt with at all , or not in detail . The references at the end of this chapter provide a wealth of material for the student who wishes to acquire real competence in the science of phonetics . We have seen that the articulation of vowels is characterized by offering practically no resistance to the passage of air through the mouth , so that the acoustic character of vocalic sounds is determined by the shape of the resonance chamber formed by particular positions of the tongue and jaws . An important result is , as has also been mentioned , that vocalic sounds are much longer and louder than consonantal ones . The mouth is open for all vowel sounds , but slightly more so for some than others , which is responsible for the traditional terms " close " and " open " in the phonetic description of vowels . The really significant articulator , however , is the tongue ; the relative elevation of either its tip or its base ( and sometimes intermediate positions ) gives us a basic set of vowels and a basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vowels used in most languages can be quite precisely located from an articulatory point of view . In Figure 31 we locate what   are traditionally known in phonetics as the " cardinal vowels " ( more or less equivalent to the vowels of Italian or Spanish ) , adding the English " schwa " ( represented by a in sofa , comma ; phonetic symbol a ) , as a typical example of a " middle vowel . " If close investigation is made of the actual mouth and tongue positions in the pronunciation of the vowels of a particular language , say English , these positions will be found to assume a trapezoidal or triangular shape ( Fig. 32 ) , which has become familiar to students as " the vowel triangle . " In Figure 32 , note the symbols m for the sound of a in hat , back , and a for the sound of a in fall , Walter . By referring to this pattern of classification and to the " cardinal vowels " or those of a particular language , it is possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one proficient in phonetics can produce it with reasonable accuracy , even without having heard it before . Thus , we may describe a vowel as " a high front vowel , more open than the i of English machine , " and a phonetician would probably identify the I of English hit . We can describe German a as " approximately the i of English machine , pronounced with the lips rounded , " and a student can come close enough to the sound produced by a native speaker of German to be understandable to the latter .   But when it comes to extremely fine points , phonetic description on the articulatory basis is hopelessly hampered ? first by the fact that it is extremely difficult , if not impossible , to make sufficiently close observations of articulating organs in operation ; second , by the fact that fine points in phonetics invariably shade off into phonemics ( see the next chapter ) , since the investigator discovers that the actual sound produced on a given occasion is highly variable , provided it fulfills the norms for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Articulatory phonetics studies and classifies the sounds of speech according to the way in which they are produced . Acoustic phonetics is a subdivision of that branch of physics which studies sound : it therefore studies speech sounds according to their characteristics as sounds , however produced . Sound is , as physics tells us , a wave motion in air , very much like the wave motion created in a body of water when we drop a stone into it . A cross section of the resulting ripples , or waves , is illustrated in Figure 33 . In air , a sound-wave is propagated from its source in all directions ; but viewed in section in any single plane , a wave may be correctly represented by the familiar " wavy " line . Three characteristics of any sound are pitch , loudness ( or volume ) and timbre : the first refers to whether it is a " high " or " low " sound , the last , to those characteristics which enable us to tell a note ( pitch ) played on a piano from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by frequency ( in fact , the two words are equivalent terms , one in music , one in physics ) . Suppose , at the seashore , you take a stopwatch and count the number of waves that break on the beach within a minute : you are measuring the frequency of that particular wave motion ( presumably it would be higher in a storm ) . But audible sound is not produced until we have 20 or 30 pulses per second , and even this would be a very low sound ; most familiar sounds result from vibrations , or cycles , of several hundred per second . The note A ( above middle C ) to which orchestras tune , has a frequency of 440 cycles per second . The loudness of a sound is determined by the amplitude of the waves .   In Figure 34B , it will be noted that the frequency of the motion ( 2.5 waves per centimeter ) is the same as for Figure 33 , but B is a much more ample wave than A : the height ( or depth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line b ) is three times that of A. The sound represented by B would , therefore , be a much louder sound ? exactly three times as loud . The timbre of a sound is somewhat more complicated . Actually most of the things that produce tone do not produce only one tone , but a cluster of tones at once , one of which is dominant ( called the fundamental ) ; the remainder ( the harmonics ) are in harmony with it . To be audible for practical purposes , the sound must be reinforced by resonance chambers or resonators ; and these inevitably reinforce some of the harmonics more than others . From this fact arises the character of the tone ? the difference between one man 's voice and another 's , or between a piano and a tuba producing the same bass note . Sounds may be divided into musical sounds and noises . In musical sounds , as just described , there is either one pure tone ( uniform vibration at the same frequency ) , or a cluster of tones with varying loudness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mathematical proportions ; that is , if the fundamental has a frequency of 110 cycles per second , the harmonics will have frequencies of 220 , 330 , 440 , 550 , 660 , and so on up to about 25,000 cycles per second , above which sounds are inaudible to the human ear . If , on the other hand , the loudness of a sound is scattered at random over the whole range of frequencies , a listener would call the sound noise . In language , vowels are closest to musical notes , and most consonants are noise . It will be evident that we are working toward an alternative way of describing a speech sound : not according to how it is produced , but according to its physical characteristics as a sound . This description can be given in terms of amplitude , frequency , and timbre . The last , however , is most usually neglected , because it involves a highly technical procedure known as Fourier analysis , whereby one complex wave is resolved into several simple waves . The process formerly required a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but with today 's mechanical computers , quite a good amount of analysis can be done in a reasonable time . Various mechanical devices have been developed that can convert sound into some visual form which can thus be more readily studied   and , perhaps , permanently recorded . Familiar for a long time and part of the equipment of every radio station is the oscilloscope , which analyzes the sound fed into it in a continuous wavy line . When broadcasting equipment is turned on but not operating , the oscilloscope pictures the radio wave which is the station 's frequency . When something is broadcast , this tone is " modulated " by varying its frequency ( FM = frequency modulation ) or its amplitude ( AM ) . A pure tone appears on the oscilloscope almost exactly as it is drawn theoretically , but a speech or a full orchestra naturally create much more complex patterns . A greatly enlarged tracing of the groove of an LP record would , in different proportions , look almost exactly like an oscillogram of the same sounds . The " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) is another way of converting sound into a visual image ; when " scanned " by a photo-electric cell , this strip will be converted back into , for example , dialogue with a musical score behind it . But the machine which is of most use to linguists and most used by them is the sound spectrograph , which does more or less the same thing as the sound film , but with more precision . The sound spectrograph produces a vertical band in which the amount of energy ( amplitude ) in a given range of frequencies is measured and recorded by lighter or darker shadings in each frequency range . Figure 36a illustrates a spectrogram . The vertical axis represents the frequencies within the range of human hearing . The horizontal , left-right dimension is time ; the spectrograph does not really analyze continuously , but new readings at intervals of a few seconds can be set side by side , and thus produce a sort of continuity . The blackness or grayness of the bands reflects amplitude ? more sensitively than a sound film , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a continuous-type spectrogram . The lowest frequency range at which energy is shown is the fundamental note , those above it the overtones . It will immediately be seen that usually one or more of the overtones is stronger than the fundamental : this is why we hear a man singing a on the note C , instead of hearing just the note C. It appears that certain of these strong overtones three , or perhaps only two ? determine the acoustic character of the vowel , to the extent that black marks can be drawn on a tape at the levels corresponding to the appropriate frequencies , the tape
