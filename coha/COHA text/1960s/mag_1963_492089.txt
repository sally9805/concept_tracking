INTEGRATION WITH DIGNITY A small group of responsible citizens plotted to avert violence . A t I : 30 P.M. on January 28. 1963 , a bright but cold day at Clemson College in the Piedmont hills of South Carolina . some 160 TV , radio , magazine and newspaper reporters waited quietly for the first Negro student to enroll in a white school in South Carolina . The Negro 's name was and is Harvey Gantt , and many people expected his imminent arrival to bring on one of the nation 's worst racial explosions . In fact , of course , it did nothing of the kind  --  as everyone who has followed the case is aware . But behind that amazing fact lies a complex and fascinating story that has never been told until now . For the peace with which Harvey Gantt entered Clemson was no mere lucky happenstance . Violence did seem clearly in the cards . South Carolinians are notoriously passionate when it comes to defending the South or southern " customs . " The logic of South Carolina 's history and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another Oxford , Mississippi . South Carolina was the spiritual , cultural and financial center of the South when Mississippi was still Indian territory . The fact is that South Carolinians created the South as a politically self-conscious region , led it out of the Union , and then fired the first shot of the Civil War . Elaborate security precautions had been made to protect Gantt at Clemson , and his routine for the day had been scheduled with the precision of an astronaut shot . He was to arrive at Tillman Hall , the old brick administration building , any minute now . 1 le was to go inside and register , come out another door , walk 35 yards to his dormitory , visit his room briefly , and then walk another 750 yards to the architectural-school building to be interviewed by the dean . The press  --  more than waited for James Meredith at the University of Mississippi  --  was ready . At 1:33 P.M. , only three minutes behind schedule , a black 1959 Buick sedan came slowly up the drive , parked in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frantic jostle . Tripods clanged as they were hastily dragged into position . Cameras whirred and clicked . Voices began to be heard talking sententiously into microphones . But that was the action , all of it . It was one of those moments when the paraphernalia of coverage overwhelms the event . It was excitement without substance . The only sign of an " angry mob , " aside from the press , was an assemblage of about 200 students , standing with their jacket collars turned up against the wind , laughing at the antics of the reporters . There were still 100 or so of them around when Gantt came out of Tillman . But by the time Gantt emerged from his dormitory , only a handful were there to watch him start his walk to the architectural building . The reporters who had been following Gantt fell back , leaving him to the TV and radio men , who kept sticking microphones in front of the young Negro 's mouth , insisting , " Come on , Harvey , say something ! " But he was silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press , the day was over . And nothing had happened . Not one thing . South Carolina , emotionally the deepest Deep South state of them all , had met and peaceably passed its most serious racial crisis since the Civil War . Why had n't something happened ? What was the explanation for this astonishing turn of events ? Had South Carolina learned a lesson from Oxford ? Or was it something else ? The question was important : if South Carolina could keep the peace , so could any southern state . The answer is this : When South Carolina 's turn came to face the inevitable fact of racial change , its responsible people , its leadership group , its " power structure " took the initiative and handled the crisis with dignity , dignity for the Negro as well as for the white man . This is why the South Carolina story is one of the most significant  --  and reassuring  --  stories in the recent history of race relations in this country . The story begins on July 1 , 1961 , a day so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the annual Watermelon Festival in the small Black Belt county seat of Hampton , the biggest businessman in South . Carolina stood up and delivered himself of these somewhat astonishing sentiments : " The desegregation issue can not continue to be hidden behind the door . This situation can not satisfactorily be settled at the lunch counter and bus station . We have a definite obligation to increase the productivity of our Negro citizens , to provide them with good jobs at good wages and to continue to assure them of fair treatment .... By raising their education and economic status , we would raise the whole economy of the state . " Charles Daniel , the speaker , knew what he was doing even if his audience of stunned cotton planters and restless beauty queens did not . Tough , hard-boiled , self-made and ultraconservative , Daniel had hewn together in three decades the largest construction company in the Southeast . Now he had struck the opening blow in a carefully planned effort to save Clemson College . He had joined the ranks of a handful of shrewd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1961 , pledged themselves to see to it that Clemson stayed open and unharmed , even if it had to integrate . The little group included besides Daniel : Robert Edwards , Clemson 's president , a hard-driving textile executive who had been brought to Clemson originally as vice president in charge of development ; Edgar Brown , chairman of Clemson 's board of trustees , state senator from Barnwell County , president pro tempore of the state senate and the Daddy Rabbit of South Carolina politics ; John K. Cauthen , executive vice president of the South Carolina Textile Manufacturers Association and the most skillful lobbyist in the state ; Ernest F. Hollings , the handsome young governor of the state , who was making new industry the focus of his administration 's effort ; Wayne Freeman , editor of the Greenville News and one of the five nonlegislative members of the Gressette Corn mittee , the state 's clearinghouse for racial problems , named for State Senator Marion Gressette . It was a loose , informal coalition ; the five men never met as a group . If there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do what he could in whatever way he thought best to fulfill their common intention . The seed of this understanding was planted in the spring of 1961 when Edwards called Cauthen about something else . Before hanging up , Edwards asked Cauthen if he thought the state 's businessmen would be willing to share some of the responsibility for the problems that would arise if Harvey Gantt , who had applied for admission to Clemson in January , 1961 , was finally admitted to the school on court order . A " monster " to be stopped Cauthen was sympathetic , and he went to work . South Carolina is a small , unusually cohesive state , and the lines of communication between its seats of political and economic power cross and recross at dozens of points . Cauthen sent feelers and messages along these interior lines , found support not only from businessmen but also from men like Hollings and Freeman and Brown , who are not . By the end of the year Cauthen , Daniel , Edwards and the others had , in " talking around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important body of opinion in the state that firmly believed in law and order at all costs . This was a solid achievement . But it was still an " inside " one . When Governor Hollings toured the state in the fall of 1961 he was shocked at the kind of talk he heard . He told me , " People thought I ought to have some magic to stop the monster that was about to gobble us up , or elsethey expected me to go to jail . It looked to me like it was high time we started sobering people up before it turned out to be too late . " Having been turned down on his first application , Gantt reapplied for admission to Clemson in January , 1962 . It was Hollings 's custom to hold an off-the-record press briefing the week before the General Assembly convened , and he seized that moment to strike a blow . " Before 1962 has passed , " he told newsmen that January 9 , " South Carolina 's legal defenses will fall like a house of cards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitable . We arc not going to secede . " Not long after this the authoritative Columbia State began to give extensive , detailed coverage to Gantt , forcing by its example other newspapers in the state to treat the story as fully and as fairly . They did . But there was n't much news about Gantt and Clemson during the spring and summer of 1962 . It was election time in South Carolina . Hollings ran for the U. S. Senate , trying to unseat the wily old veteran , Olin D. Johnston , in the Democratic primary , and got clobbered . Donald Russell , a wealthy Spartanburg lawyer who had served in Washington as an assistant to James F. Byrnes when the latter was Secretary of State , was elected governor to succeed Hollings , to take over in January , 1963 . Gantt 's second application had never been formally acted upon , and the young Negro , represented by N.A.A.C.P. attorneys , filed suit in Federal court on July 7 , 1962 . What this meant did not hit hard in South Carolina until September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . INTEGRATION WITH DIGNITY Mississippi indirectly called for help , and there were South Carolinians  --  plenty of them  --  who felt that Governor Hollings should go at once to Governor Barnett 's side . A member of the state house of representatives , A. W. Red Bethea , insisted that Hollings lead a motorcade of South Carolinians to Oxford . Hollings refused  --  and was rewarded with a batch of insulting telegrams . Other South Carolinians began to back up Barnett . Russell praised Barnett 's " courage and resolution , " and said he was " hopeful that Barnett 's conduct may be invaluable to us in demonstrating the strength of Southern conviction . " State Senator Marion Gressette , Mister Segrega-tion in South Carolina , the man who is chairman of the state committee set up to " discourage " integration , called on the South " to rally to the support of the great state of Mississippi . " Hollings 's silence stood out and annoyed some South Carolinians . Farley Smith , longtime executive secretary of the Citizens Councils of South Carolina , remarked , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all southern states , has not , through its governor , made its position crystal clear . " A few days later , in the first week of October . a reporter cornered Hollings . Would Hollings , or would Hollings not , he willing to go to jail to prevent integration of a South Carolina school ? " If it works out like Mississippi , " Hollings replied , " jail would certainly he the safest place . " He was due to attend the Southern Governors Conference at Hollywood , Florida , the next week . " Faubus and Patterson Governors Orville Faubus of Arkansas and John M. Patterson of Alabama were waiting for me to head up a movement to wire and welcome Ross Barnett to the conference , " Hollings said . He refused . If Hollings did nothing to " help " Mississippi , he did something to help South Carolina meet 11.5 forthcoming crisis . He sent Pete Strom , head of S.L.E.D. ( South Carolina Law Enforcement Division ) , to Oxford . He told him to study that situation and to come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counsel , a security plan for Clemson . He laid down three guidelines for Walker ( I ) The plan must he foolproof ; there should be no question of the need for U.S. marshals ; ( 2 ) it should be designed to prevent even the possibility of allowing a crowd to gather , and ( 3 ) a carefully thought-out schedule must be arranged for controlling the movement of the press . Through the late summer and fall Gantt 's attorneys and South Carolina engaged in a series of legal maneuvers , but by November it was clear that Clemson sooner or later would have to admit Gantt . It was just a matter of time , and there was not much of that . Meanwhile Cauthen had not been idle . He was " talking around " in those key places he knew so well . One day in the fall , for example , he and Clemson President Edwards went to Hartsville to see A. L. M. Wiggins , the elder statesman of South Carolina 's business community . A former railroad president and Under Secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee on Higher Education . " Mr. Wiggins was very strong on our side , " Cauthen says . Up to now , none of the little group had taken a public stand on the case of Harvey Gantt , but the hour was obviously near when somebody must speak out clearly . The occasion arose at the end of December , when a Charleston newspaperman called Clemson board chairman Brown and put to him one of those **33;2295;TOOLONG questions : " Now that it is pretty certain that the Clemson board is going to admit Harvey Gantt , what explanation would you give to the people who elected you , in the event of such a decision ? " Nobody had said that Clemson was going to admit Gantt , but Brown took down the reporter 's question in shorthand and promised to give him an answer later . He called Cauthen in Columbia , Edwards at Clemson . Both agreed to meet Brown in Barnwell the next morning . They talked it over , then Cauthen drafted a statement . Brown released it that day to the Charleston newspaperman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associations . " Your premise is false , " Brown 's statement noted . " If the ultimate decision of the Federal courts directs that Harvey Gantt should be admitted , my position is that the board of trustees and the administration at Clemson College will not tolerate violence on the Clemson campus . " The trouble might come from any one or all three of these powerful men I. James F. Byrnes . Still , in his 80 's , the same dapper little man with gray felt hat whose picture was once frequently taken on the White House steps . Byrnes is today " a bitter man , " according to those who are close to him . When Byrnes returned to South Carolina in the 1950 's and became governor , he convinced the legislature that it ought to levy a sales tax , and he undertook an extensive program of school-building designed to create separate and equal school systems in South Carolina . " He thought the Supreme Court would recognize this , " I was told . " He had convinced himself the Court would rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clarendon Case concerning public-school segregation in Clarendon County . When it voted nine to nothing against , he turned bitter . " Asa member of Clemson 's board of trustees , Byrnes " would n't say yes , and he would n't say no , " about Gantt . His attitude in board meetings was such that some of the others on the board felt that Byrnes might , if Gantt were admitted , make an independent statement that would , considering his prestige , do serious damage to law and order . 2 . State Senator Marion Gressette . Gressette was No. 2 in seniority in the senate , a man whose sincerity and integrity have never been questioned in the legislature . Every bill that might affect or be affected by a change in the status quo in segregation went to the Gressette Committee . From Calhoun , a Black Belt county in the Low Country , Gressette announced to the press that he was praying every night over the Clemson situation , and it is significant that not even the worst cynic doubted his statement . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Citizens Councils to stay dormant . For Gressette to go along with a plan that called for admitting a Negro to Clemson without some kind of protest would be a severe wrench for Gressette personally and for all the people who had had complete confidence in him as an anti-integration warrior . If Gressette came out publicly against admitting Gantt , all the hitherto latent forces of disorder in the state would come alive . 3 . A. W. Red Bethea . Bethea is the most forthright racist in South Carolina . If Bethea went to Clemson to lead a " protest , " as , in fact , he threatened to do , it would be hard to turn him away . He was both a member of the legislature and a Clemson alumnus . Cauthen moved quickly to get business support on the line for a public announcement . Eighteen of the state 's top textile executives met for lunch at the new , luxurious Palmetto Club in Columbia on January 3 , 1963 . When they had finished their business , Cauthen passed out three-by-five file cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It read in part : " The major business and industrial interests of the state strongly approve theannounced Note : it had not been announced then determination of the board of trustees and the administration of Clemson College to maintain law and order at all times . " Cauthen asked the executives to vote Yes or No on the cards , and to hand them in without signing their names . He got IS Yeses . The next day the Chamber of Commerce followed suit . Polled by telephone , 70 South Carolina businessmen-52 were members of the Chamber 's board of directors , 12 were former presidents and six were officers  --  unanimously approved the statement . The state bankers ' association and the broadcasters ' association followed in quick order . Nowhere in the South in the recent history of racial change had the business community taken such a strong stand in advance . Clemson President Edwards on January 3 had a " very serious " meeting with Gressette and some members of his committee . Without acrimony Edwards made it plain that if he was not supported in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would resign . He got down to brass tacks with Gressette about the effect of ' violence . One of the nation 's largest manufacturers had made overtures about building a multimillion-dollar plant in Gressette 's county . The state makes Its choice " Senator , if there 's a ruckus at Clemson those people wo n't even plant scrub oak in Calhoun County , " Edwards said passionately . On January 9 , Governor Hollings spoke out , in a farewell address to the state legislature . " As we meet , " he said , " South Carolina is running out of courts . This General Assembly must make clear South Carolina 's choice , a government of laws rather than a government of men . We must move on with dignity . It must be done with law and order . The state 's institutions and all law-enforcement agencies have been charged with their responsibilities . " When Hollings was halfway through , Bethea rose in his seat , took a step as if to leave , but then changed his mind and sat down . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They were impressed , " a legislative correspondent told me later . The next night Hollings called Attorney General Robert Kennedy and outlined the security plan which by now had been worked out . He told Kennedy that U.S. marshals would not be needed . Kennedy promised not to send them . On January 12 Hollings held a meeting in his office for a final review of the security plan . Donald Russell Jr. , son of and assistant to his father , the incoming governor , was present and took a copy for his father to see . The plan is probably the most complete and carefully thought-out one ever drawn up in the United States to meet the threat of racial violence . None of its details have ever before been made public . It warned all officers of the law : " The state of South Carolina has assumed responsibility of maintaining law and order as a state function , and the state is capable of carrying it out . " It told them to " tolerate verbal abuse or similar harassment . . . but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties with efficiency and dispatch .... If trouble occurs , " the instructions said , " remove troublemakers quickly to detention areas set aside for large numbers of persons . " A S.L.E.D. aircraft was to patrol from the sky , police photographers were to be on the campus to take movies and photographs , the sheriffs of adjoining counties were briefed ; magistrates were put on duty so that they could issue warrants ; fire-fighting and medical equipment was made ready ; and a central command post was set up to coordinate all the activity . An elaborate program of briefing was set up for the Clemson student body and faculty . The student body was to be policed by its own student government . Supervisors were given the right to send students to their individual dormitory rooms . Students were warned that " gatherings which indicate unnecessary curiosity ... will be avoided . Counseling , advising and frank dismission should solve most problems . Situations requiring more forthright action will be dealt with firmly and effectively . " The courts began to move quickly . On January 22 District @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and signed the order admitting Gantt to Clemson . That same day State Senator John D. Long of Union County rose in the upper chamber of the legislature on a point of personal order . It was " cowardly " of Clemson to admit Gantt without a fight , he said . " I would prefer that my children be raised in ignorance  --  not knowing ' B ' from Bullsfootthan to see them cringing and bowing before tyranny , " he cried out . Word of the debate reached the house , and Bethea and many of his colleagues came over to the senate , packed the galleries . Senator H. H. lessen of Dorchester County joined in on Long 's side . " South Carolina should not lie down and let itself be walked over , " he said . The time had come for Gressette to take his stand . He rose and began to speak slowly , sadly . " A lot of things happen in life , " he said . " We have disappointments . Sometimes 1 feel like making a speech like my two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are engaged in a war . But this war can not be won by violence or by inflammatory speeches . I have preached peace and good order too long to change my thinking . " If the legislature now felt that he had failed in his task , Gressette said , he would resign . When he had finished , the legislature rose and gave him an ovation . And Senator Long took the floor again , this time to propose that the members remain on their feet for a standing vote of confidence for Gressette . Before the day was over Byrnes issued a statement . " Gantt has succeeded in forcing himself into Clemson , " Byrnes said , but he would not be welcomed at the college " by independent men and women of the student body .... Thank goodness , " said the former Supreme Court Justice , " not even the Supreme Court has ordered that be done  --  as yet ! " The Clemson board of trustees met with Governor Russell and the Gressette Committee during the morning to set the strategy for making the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that press conferences would be held separately by Russell , by Gressette and by President Edwards  --  in quick successive order , at two P.M. , at two-thirty and at three . Promptly at two Russell came through a door into a paint-fresh new executive conference room , handed out a few copies of his statement and read quickly : " We shall meet and solve this problem peaceably , without violence . " The reporters scampered across the street to the capitol and heard Gressette read : " Peace and good order must be maintained both on and off the college campus . " Bethea was there , hunched deep down in an upholstered chair , an incongruous figure in the light bark-cloth-papered room . Reporters did not have time to stop and ask him for a comment . It was a short walk from the capitol to the studios of W1S-TV where Edwards was to read his statement before the cameras . A few seconds after the press corps arrived , Edwards emerged , took his position before a microphone and began to talk : The Trustees approved " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Gantt was to be admitted " exactly as any other transfer student . " When Edwards finished , someone passed out copies of Cauthen 's statement  --  the endorsement of law and order by the manufacturers , bankers , businessmen and broadcasters . It almost got passed by in the rush . I had made the rounds with the rest of the newsmen , and , as I started to leave , I saw Brown and Cauthen sitting against a far wall . I went over and Senator Brown offered me a ride back to my hotel . The three of us walked out into the street again . " Well , John , " said Brown , pulling himself erect , cocking his head on one side and then giving Cauthen a smile , " it 's been a long day , has n't it ? " " Yes , it has , senator , " said Cauthen , returning the smile , " but I think everything 's going to be all right now . " And it was all right .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
