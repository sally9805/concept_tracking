RUNNING through all of John Stein-beck 's career as a novelist is an uneasy and unresolved debate about the nature of man . In some of his books ? Cannery Row and Sweet Thursday are obvious examples ? he sees man as essentially a biological organism like another , innocently helping himself to whatever he needs to make life bearable and enjoyable without regard to the rules of conduct laid down by society , which is portrayed as deserving whatever mulcting it gets . In such books Steinbeck is the sympathetic , amused , but largely detached observer , looking upon his characters with a benign , forgiving smile such as one might turn upon a bunch of puppies playfully chewing up a shoe , as long as the shoe belongs to somebody else . But alongside the biologist-observer there is another Steinbeck who sees man as a moral being , a being whose actions constitute significant choices between right and wrong . This Steinbeck is capahie of indignation , of outrage , and his masterpiece is The Grapes of Wrath . In only one book , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dubious Battle , Steinbeck arranged a confrontation of sorts between his two views of man ; one of the main characters in that book is a passive but sympathetic observer of the action , a young doctor who is ready to help the sick or wounded strikers with his professional skill but who otherwise refuses to participate ; the other is an activist , the leader of the strike , a man convinced that society is wrong and that he must do something to attempt to set it right . The debate between the two remains incom hisive , as it seems to have remained in Steinbeck 's own mind , though over the years the attitude of the young doctor has tended to predominate . Steinbeck 's new book , The Winter of Our Discontent ( Viking , $4.50 ) , is the work of Stein-beck the moralist . The main character is a man named Ethan Allen Hawley , a veteran of thesecond world war who lives in an old seaport town on the Long Island coast . He is happily married and has a son and daughter in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and influential but his father dissipated most of the family fortune and what little remained Hawley himself lost in an unsuccessful business venture after the war , and now he works as a clerk in a grocery store . Of the family 's past greatness there remain only a fine house that Hawley still lives in , an assortment of family mementos , and a vague community awareness that the Hawleys were once people of consequence in the town . At the outset of the story , Hawley is content enough with his lot ; he is willing to go without a car and a television set and other convenience ; and marks of status because he enjoys being an honest man who does a humble job conscientiously . But all around him he sees other men cheating and lying in various picayune , semilegal , or illegal ways to get ahead , and he begins to wonder if he is not a fool to refrain from doing the same . Then when a local hanker offers him the chance to come in on a real estate deal , he decides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulate a stake and re-establish his family fortunes . Soon he is up to his neck in a series of shady but ingenious schemes to get money without working for it , and the plot is made up of the working out of these schemes . In the end Hawley realizes that success of the sort he has gone after carries a moral price that is for him exorbitant . This realization is borne in upon him largely by what happens to his own son . The boy , a pure opportunist with none of his father 's scruples , has won a prize for an essay on The Spirit of America , " and as a consequence is well on his way to becoming a television star when it is discovered that he has actually cribbed the essay from the speeches of various past great Americans that he has found among the family books in the attic . In one respect Steinbeck 's morality has undergone a profound change . In the earlier books that be wrote as a novelist , hooks like In Dubious 13aItle and The Grapes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the good men were men fighting for change , for something new . But The Winter of Our Discontent is a deeply conservative book ; the good man is now the preserver of the best in an inherited tradition ; his task is Rs hand on that best to his progeny . In a way Steinbeck the passive observer of life and Steinbeck the moralist have merged . because the moral man has become the man who is aware of the chicanery and double-dealing around him but who quietly lives his own humble life by his own principles . Such . presumably , is the true " spirit of America . " But if Steinbeck has at least partially succeeded in merging or reconciling his two views of man in The Winter of Our Discontent , he has not succeeded in finding the right style to do it in . The book has the tone and atmosphere of lighthearted suburban domestic comedy , quite inappropriate to the seriousness of the theme or of some of the events . At one point , for instance . Hawley plans to rob a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole incident has about it an air of wild improvisation and improbability that keep the reader from taking it seriously ; he knows as he reads that somehow our hero will not commit the robbery as surely as he knows in watching an old Harold Lloyd comedy that our hero will not fall off the twentieth-story ledge . And , rather typically , the situation is resolved not through any exploration of the morality of robbing banks , any failure of courage or triumph of nobility , but through the all-too-pat fairy-gocnotherish arrival of another character . In sum the novel seems too often to be an example of the very qualities that it deplores . The plot is so full of clever devices and ingenious tricks that the moral issues become lost or muted or glossed over ; the situations presented ought to lead to a searching of the soul but usually they are resolved by slick contrivance . Explicitly in his story Steinbeck has pointed a moral about the spirit of America ; implicitly , by his way of telling his story , he has perhaps pointed another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silone is also concerned with the relation between private morality and society ; indeed this subject has occupied him in his novels much more consistently than it has Steinbeck . In his new book , The Fox and the Camellias ( Harper , $5.50 ) , Silone 's main character is a middle-aged Socialist named Daniele , a Swiss who lives just over the border from Italy . Daniele is involved in a plot against the Italian indicated , but apparently it is the period of Mussolini 's dictatorship ) , and his chief accomplice in the plot is a bold and sturdy young man named Agostino , who not only shares Daniele 's political ideas but hopes to become a member of his family through marriage to Daniele 's elder daughter Silvia . But the Italian government is aware of what is going on so near its border , and it sends an agent into Switzerland to uncover the plot . This agent attempts to work through an old seamstress who because or her work goes into the houses of the leading citizens of the community and is therefore able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also particularly vulnerable to intimidation because she is in fact an Italian citizen who can be deported if the authorities are alerted to her status . In her distress at the role of spy that is being forced upon her , the old seamstress turns to Daniele to help her out , and he alerts his aide and supposed future son-in-law Agostino to keep an eye on the Italian agent , with the result that Agostino beats up the agent within an inch of his life . But then a reversal sets in . The seriously injured Italian agent takes refuge in a farmhouse , pretending that he has been hurt in an automobile accident , and the farmhouse happens to be Daniele 's . There , in her father 's absence , Silvia , the betrothed of Agostino , nurses the young Italian back to tile , and they proceed to fall in love with each other . It is not until he is ready to leave the house that the Italian agent goes into Silvia 's father 's study and discovers from the books and documents there that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the very group of plotters that he has come to Switzerland to destroy . In his anguish at the discovery of the conflict between his personal feelings for Silvia and his political loyalty to the regime that her father opposes , the young man commits suicide , and the hook ends . The point of all this seems to be that in any political conflict there are men capable of a mixture of nobility and baseness on both sides ? in using his great strength to rough up the Italian agent , Agostino is doing what he thinks is right , though it is a brutal act ; in his horror at the conflict between his personal and public loyalties , the young Italian commits suicide , an act both desperate and brave . The symbolism of Silonc 's title is open to a number of interpretations , but the fox seems to represent the public , political violence and division that lurk behind and constantly threaten the fragrant tenderness of personal relationships . On the whole , The Fox and the Camellias is a curiously flat little story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comedy and warmth that tend to be lost in the somewhat stilted translation of peasant speech . where between the simplicity of a fable and the complexity of a novel , without quite achieving the virtues of either . The characters are so lightly sketched that the reader hardly knows them well enough to care greatly about what happens to them ; the plot is clumsy , and the point it makes is scarcely new . THE HANDSOME ENGLISHMAN Jimmy Riddle , by Ian Brook ( Putnam , $3.95 ) is a novel about contemporary politics that approaches its subject with remarkably little ambiguity , though the point of view it espouses so clearly and emphatically is now unpopular and will strike many readers as old-fashioned if not downright reactionary . The scene is an African kingdom called Alabasa , which will not be found on any map , at least not under that name . The nominal and in many ways the actual ruler is a hereditary chieftain , the Balabasa of Alabasa , a man deeply learned in the ancient wisdom of his people and committed to their ancestral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world to be deeply concerned about the way it is encroaching on his kingdom . His colleague in rule and best friend is the local British District Commissioner ( for Alabasa is part of a British colony ) , Jimmy Riddle . Riddle is the sort of colonial administrator that Kipling would have regarded as the right son : lie is a gentleman , with a gentleman 's ability to hold his liquor , handle his women , speak native languages , act with dispatch and courage and imagination in any situation , and recognize in the Balabasa another gentleman with whom he can deal man-to-man . Left to themselves , the Balabasa and jimmy Riddle between them would prepare the Alabasians for the modern world in their own slow but safe and gentlemanly way . But they are not left to themselves , because ranged against them are three powerful enemies : the British Resident , who lives in the distant capital of the colony and has no concern for the responsibilities of his position beyond the advancement of hisfice in far-off London , which is hag-ridden with the anticolonial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Nations intervention ; and the new African nationalist leaders , portrayed as a group of brash , self-seeking upstarts , ignorant sons of detribalized slaves , with just enough low cunning to line their pockets with foreign aid and to manipulate well-meaning but stupid anticolonialists to their own advantage . It is unnecessary to trace the process by which Jimmy Riddle and the Balabasa defeat their enemies and save the day for those who really understand the " white chaps " and the " black chaps " of the right sort , but to a reader who knows no more about Africa than what he reads in the daily papers , their victory is likely to appear as a piece of sentimental anachronism . It looks as if the future belongs to the nationalist leaders , whether or not they are the kind of cheap opportunists that they are pictured as being in Jimmy Riddle . The book advances the argument for the white-man's-burden view of colonialism with a good deal of force and conviction , and much of it is entertaining reading , but it is some light years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonialism as Forster 's A Passage to India and Onvell 's Burmese Days , on grounds quite apart from the point of view it espouses . NOVELS ABOUT ARTISTS A NEW novel by Jay Williams , The Forger ( Atheneum , $4.95 ) , is an unpretentious but moderately entertaining story about a group of young artists in Greenwich Village . Most of them live in a kind of moral and artistic twilight zone , dependent on the whims of art editors for the commercial jobs that keep them alive but at the same time trying to manipulate dealers , rich patrons , critics , and foundation grants so that they can find the leisure to do the kind of independent work that really interests them . The main character and narrator of The Forger is a young man named Rufus Griffin , a Brooklyn boy who discovered his talent early and has already established a small reputation for himself , though he nowlascivious covers for paperbacks and pursuing assorted young WOBlell of his acquaintance . But he discovers that he has a certain gift for imitating the style of earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damaged works of art , but then the possibility of outright forgery presents itself , and he sees the way out that he , like all his friends , is seeking ? a way of making a large amount of money that will free him from further hack work to paint as he pleases . Alongside Griffin 's development as a forger in art runs a love affair that is also a kind of forgery in personal relations . Griffin contracts a liaison with a rich girl named Adrienne who is living the life of an artist though in fact she has no talent . At bottom Griffin knows that Adrienne is extremely unstable and not to be trusted , that their relationship has a shaky present and no future , but he keeps himself chained to her through willful self-deception as to her true nature , though in the end ; predictably enough , he is reclaimed from both his artistic and his personal lapses into fakery . The most interesting parts of The Forger are those that deal with the technical aspects of forgers ? the way new paintings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by experts , the methods of marketing fakes , and so on . Williams seems to be well informed about such fascinating matters . He is less interested in the moral and aesthetic problems raised by forgery , and a good deal of his book is filled out with more or less standard scenes from Bohemian life . Breakdown ( World , $4.95 ) is a first novel that is not only about a painter but also by a painter , a young Englishman named John Bratby , best known in this country for the paintings he did for the motion picture The Horse 's Mouth . Bratby has illustrated Breakdown with a good many of his own drawings , all of them vigorously repulsive . In rough outline the book traces the psychological deterioration of a successful artist over a period of years , but in fact it is an almost indescribable hodgepodge . There are some scenes of considerable force , by the author 's intrusive facetiousness and stupid commentary . The depths of his psychological penetration may be judged by such a passage as this : " ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed , and few of us arc simple to analyze , the underlying causes for our actions being often multiple and contradictory " ? an insight that will hardly be new to most readers in 196-1 . The writing is frequently marred by stale language ; things happen in " the wee small hours " and have " dire consequences " and are otherwise wrapped up in clich ? s ; yet some of the writing is forceful and direct . But the most annoying aspect of the book is the author 's way of interrupting the development of the central character 's decline with some facetious remark addressed to his " dear reader " or abandoning the central character altogether in favor of a meandering account of somebody extremely peripheral to the main story . The effect of the whole thing is a little as if Laurence Sterne had tried to write a novel based on a plot by Dostoevski . Breakdown has vitality and exuberance and imagination , but it is undisciplined and often silly . Clem Anderson by R. V. Cassill ( Simon &; Schuster , . f5.95 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a painter , and it is in every way a more ambitious book than either of those just discussed . Clem Anderson , the title-character , grows up in a small Middle Western town in the depression years and has the sexual adventures that boys in small Middle Western towns usually have , at least in novels . Then he goes to a state university ( it sounds a good deal like the University of Iowa ) where he decides that he wants to be a writer and attracts a certain amount of attention by his work , and where he falls in love with a girl named Sheila . After service in the war and a brief period in a psychiatric hospital , he and Sheila go to Mexico , where he writes a hook of poetry and starts a novel ; later they move on to Paris , then back to New York , where the novel is published with some success . Clem tries to write for the theatre ; his math -- more and more alcoholic and dies at about the age of forty in the late 1950s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prometheus Bound " ) still unwritten . In a sentence : Clem Anderson is a study of the waste and tragedy of romantic genius in America . But such a summary presents the barest bones of a novel that is not only very long ( 627 pages of smallish type ) but also very elaborately developed in every dimension . Indeed , Clem Anderson is a book of which the reader gets the impression that the author has put into it everything he has thought or felt or read ; that it represents a labor so vast , so inclusive , and so personal that to criticize it adversely is almost in-humane . Yet I must confess that for my taste the book is badly inflated . There are too many incidents , too many characters , too many symbols , too much fine writing . Often the excesses of language are almost ludicrous , as in occasional figures of speech ( " we never knew whose cheek he had his tongue in when he talked like that " ) or in longer passages like the following apostrophe to a canoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freudian symbol , how can any campus be complete without thee ? You vaginal flotillas , bright-painted as an array of lipsticks on a dime-store counter , on what lakes and rivers of surrendered time do you not float , frustrating symbols of fulfillment ! Already in thee . and aching pleasure nigh . our duckfot Iduckfoot ? 1 paddles scraping thy sides like juvenile swans scrambling for purchase on the Ledean vessel ! Thou grounder on the mudbanks of the IIIisus , what poops of burnished gold bore more fitly Her of the rain puddles and Midwestern ponds and the morning surf on Cyprian beaches ? Canoe , qu'as-tu fait de ma jeunesse ? That , of course , is meant to be funny , and perhaps it is , but there are a good many serious passages that can come close to matching it for fancy literariness of allusion and diction , THE GLOOM OF THE IRISH The Edge of Sadness ( Atlantic-Little , Brown , $5 ) is Edwin O'Connor 's first novel since his extremely clo re-ace hl I ? a c-1,11,0 about Boston politics , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the previous hook in that it presents a picture of an earlier and livelier generation of Boston Irish as seen through the eyes of a younger , less exuberant man . The chief representative of the older generation in this book is not a politician as in The Last Hurrah but a businessman , chiefly an operator in slum real estate , a wily , witty , inexhaustibly vivacious and tirelessly devious old man named Charlie Carmody . O'Connor 's picture of old Carmody is a brilliant piece of characterization , though Carmody lacks the fascination of the old politician in The Last Hurrah because he is essentially a static figure , tenaciously hanging on to his fortune and relentlessly bullying his middle-aged family , but not engaged in any crucial action such as the old poli ? tician 's final fight for office . As a consequence , the next generation , the generation of old Carmody 's children , tends to occupy the center of interest its the novel . They are the characters who live on " the edge of sadness , " unable to recapture the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slums to become a man of wealth , but equally unable to free themselves of their father 's psychological domination . The most interesting member of this generation of the Carmody family is the son who became a priest , Father John Carmody , who is now the pastor of the old family parish . Father John is a curiously twisted , ingrown man , devout in his religion but hating his father and his parishioners , consumed with loneliness yet wanting to be left alone , The story is told by another priest , Father Hugh Kennedy , whose father had been an acquaintance if hardly an admirer of old Charlie Carmody , and who has himself been a lifelong friend of all the Carmody children and a fellow-seminarian with Father John . Father Kennedy has not had art easy life ; after an initially happy period in the priesthood he slowly drifted into alcoholism , until his bishop had to send him to spend four years in a sanitarium for alcoholic priests in Arizona . At the time of the story Father Kennedy a young instructor at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the relationship fails m last , and when the young man drifts back to Doris , Joan sets out to destroy him , with success . The novel is admirably written , ' tense and understated . It seems to portray a kind of post-moral world such as a reader encounters in the books of certain younger French writers ? a world in which right and wrong have little relevance to what the characters expect of themselves and of each other . I confess that it is difficult for me to take any consuming interest in characters of this sort , hut . I can admire the economy and skill with which Miss Grau has told her story . IN A Shooting Star Stegner has written a much longer and more fully developed novel . His heroine is a woman named Sabrina Castro , brought up in the strict traditions of a wealthy Boston family transplanted to California and married for about a dozen years to a cold-blooded but successful society director . On a vacation in Mexico , very much to her own surprise , Sabrina enters into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her it is a revelation ; she decides that she is deeply in love and can not return to her husband . But her lover is a good deal more circumspect about the whole thing ; when it becomes apparent that he has no intention of sacrificing his business and family to their affair , Sabrina completes the job of cutting loose from the moral standards that have previously guided her life , and becomes a sort of society tramp . In the end , of course , Sabrina gets herself straightened out , chiefly through coming to know her old Boston-bred mother , not as the dragon of propriety she has always seemed but as another woman who has also suffered and learned to bear her deprivations and indignities as Sabrina must . A Shooting Star is the work of a highly competent craftsman . The characters are skillfully drawn and the story well constructed . if it never rises much above the level of careful , conscientious workmanship , it never falls very much below it either .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
