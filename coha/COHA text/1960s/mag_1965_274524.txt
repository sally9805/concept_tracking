To loyal readers of British spy fiction , it seems almost incredible that the cold-eyed watchdogs of counterintelligence in Whitehall could let H.M.G. 's closest secrets slip into the hands of the enemy . Yet Atom Scientist Klaus Fuchs got away with it , and so did Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess of the Foreign Office , not to mention the more recent indiscretions of Admiralty Clerk , William Vassall . <P> Each case has brought another examination of security procedures , and two trials last week at the Old Bailey were no exception . In one , Aviation Ministry Engineer Frank Bossard , 52 , was sentenced to 21 years for photographing and selling , since 1961 , heaps of missile data to the Soviets for $14,000 . In another case , a Defense Ministry clerk . Sergeant Percy Allen , 33 , got ten years for peddling data on Israeli arms to Iraq and Egypt . <P> One difficulty had been an overzealous concern with spies ' legal rights , which prevented government officials from investigating suspected leaks until the courts rendered a verdict . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might bias prospective jurors or witnesses . Nonetheless , three hours after Bossard 's conviction , Prime Minister Harold Wilson announced in Commons that in the future , government employees will be grilled as soon as a lapse is discovered , though results will be kept private until after the trial . " It is not enough , once the horse has bolted , to have a high-level inquiry six months afterwards to see what went wrong , " said Wilson . <P> Naturally , something had to happen to show that the barn door is still not locked . The very next night , Housing Minister Richard Crossman , an acid critic of the Vassall affair , took some work with him to dinner at the West End 's elegant Prunier 's restaurant . After coffee , he absentmindedly left behind under the table 18 sheets stamped " Confidential . " At a nearby table was a Conservative businessman , Geoffrey Blundell-Brown , who gleefully retrieved the papers , read them , then called the Daily Express to lambaste the lapse . With that , Blundell-Brown returned the documents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson doubtless was much embarrassed .
