txt Bonn Past my office window the other day the black jack boots of green-uinformed German troops beat out a heavy tread . Sunlight shone on trumpets and brass . Music filled the air . Drums boomed out a cadence The proud Federal Border Guard of West Germany had sent a detachment to the Palais Schaumburg in Bonn to honor the man just reelected to a second term as federal Chancellor . Ludwig Erhard 's first term of office had begun Oct. 16 , 1963 . Then euphoria as well as music had tinged the air . The special treaty of alliance with France was less than a year old . Hostility hinted Hope still persisted that the two ancient enemies at last had found a way of cooperating across the Rhine . This week , as Dr. Erhard took a- crisp salute , President de Gaulle 's government seemed hostile to cherished German goals on almost every front . How could the Common Market be saved ? West Germans asked themselves , following French Foreign Minister Maurice Couve de Murville 's speech in Paris , Oct. 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treaty of Rome than brought the European Economic Community ( EEC ) into being . Paris will not give up its veto rights . Ground rules must be changed to prevent the scheduled entry of majority rule among the six Common Market members . Otherwise France will not end its Common Market // By Felix Palm Chancellor Ludwig Erhard Back to work  --  with new problems *Bonn feels cool wind // walkout , currently blocking forward movement among the six . This is France 's clear position . Earlier Paris had unveiled unofficial , but authoritative , new defense schemes to deny any nuclear role to West Germans . NATO , ' according to French plans , is to be dismantled in its present form . French relations with Moscow are warming up . Former Chancellor Konrad Adenauer spoke of " encirclement " of West Germany by France and the Soviet Union . This seems going too far . But Paris has insisted that German reunification , if and when it conies , must be within Germany 's present borders . France , . in other words , alone among Bonn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lost territories east of the Oder-Neisse line . . Against this background , Dr. Erhard 's expressed determination to seek a new understanding with Paris sounded forlorn . Unlike France , West Germany has found it hard to fan warmth into its own relations with Moscow . A visit to that city by Prof. Karl Carstens of the West German Foreign Ministry had proved disappointing . Trade could be expanded . But the Krem- lin had not softened its iron stand on German reunification . So political relations between Bonn and Moscow remained sluggish . ly cold . Britain , too , stirred unease among Germans by placing new stress on a treaty to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons to nations not now possessing them . View looks cloudy London 's new stand appeared to eclipse earlier British interest in developing some form of multilateral nuclear force within NATO , in which West Germany could share . As often before , German politicians fell back on the United States as the only partner on which the German Federal Republic fully could rely . But the cushion of American friendship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on German reunification  --  until Germans themselves came up with new proposals . Now the Defense Department reportedly wants to forget the MLF ? a multilateral nuclear fleet for NATO ; originally prompted by the State Department . Hostility in Paris , uncertainty in London , confusion in Washington , a glacial glare from Moscow ? such was the panorama viewed this week from Germany 's " temporary " capital on the Rhine .
