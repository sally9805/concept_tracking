The capital cities of the U.S. took shape for the most part when a public building was something with a cupola and plenty of columns . New York 's state capitol is a monument to the architectural style that might be called Ugly American-a granite mishmash of Second Empire , Francis I and Romanesque , with Doric columns , Corinthian columns , tile roofs , slate roofs , dormers , chimneys and rusticated stone work . The city it dominates is appropriately dismal . But last week plans were unveiled that will make Albany , in the words of Governor Nelson Rockefeller , " the most beautiful capital city in the United States . " <P> The project is a swath of promenades and skyscrapers covering 40 blocks . Designed by Architects Wallace K. Harrison ( the new Metropolitan Opera House , Rockefeller Center ) and George A. Dudley , and the Albany firm of Blatner and Williams , the mall will be centered around a 2,800-ft. concourse of reflecting pools and fountains stretching from State Street , just in front of the present capitol , to Madison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tower , which , with seven other office buildings , will house state offices now scattered in nearly 90 separate locations around the city . <P> Oddest structure will be the Meeting Center-looking like a mammoth radar dish from below and half a grapefruit from above-which will contain a 750-seat auditorium , a 300-seat conference room , plus several smaller conference rooms and exhibit space for state government units . At the south end will be a shrine : the Arch of Freedom , in which the original of Lincoln 's Emancipation Proclamation will be on display . In the same area will be a museum , a library , the state archives building , and an outdoor amphitheater . Automobiles will be banished to the nether regions . Vehicles will unload on two levels below the promenade , and beneath the reflecting pools will be parking space for 3,000 cars . <P> The $250 million project will be financed by the city of Albany , which will issue long-term bonds , while the state will lease the buildings from the city until the bonds have been paid off . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It will have a quality of monumentality , which you ca n't afford to use in New York City , for example , where the land cost is so high and the life expectancy of a building is only 15 to 20 years . " <P> " I understand this is the largest government project of its kind anywhere in the country , " says Architect Harrison . " It 's certainly going to be one of the few places in the world where that American invention , the skyscraper , is given its proper place in relation to the buildings around it .
