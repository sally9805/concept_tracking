" We do n't read music , " said Phillip Crosby in what must have been the most plausible statement made by a public figure last week . " Like the old man , we fake it . " The trouble , of course , is that Ring 's boys do not fake it like the old man . Phillip , Dennis and Lindsay ( Brother Gary has his own act ) sing roughly like three C-plus scholars at a fraternity party . They are clean-cut , modest and likable ; after listening to them for a little while , one longs to hear three singers who are dirty-cut , vain and loathsome , but talented . <P> Although the Crosby boys , who have no illusions about their act , must sometimes want to buy a bowling alley and settle down , they have toured successfully for two years in such neon nirvanas as the Sahara Hotel in Las Vegas and Manhattan 's Latin Quarter , where they played last week . The secret is conspiracy . The Latin Quarter pretends that it is wild and wicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are hugely entertained when the comedian kicks the M.C. Their wives counterfeit sophisticated smiles when bare-breasted show girls jiggle onstage . And when the Crosby brothers admit that , boy , we really hacked up that last song , everyone cheerfully conspires to pretend that they are kidding . <P> Short and thick-bodied , the boys bounce in front of the mike on the toes of their elevator shoes . They open with a half-sung patter about how hard they have worked on the act and how glad they are to be there . Then they charge down among the first few tables and shake hands . Phillip recalls that when they were children on their father 's ranch at Elko , Nev. , " there was n't much to do of a night except sit on the front porch and harmonize . " They do , uncertainly , in husky voices that resemble each other too much and Bing 's too little . Punching shoulders , mugging at clinkers and bouncing all the while , they work like piano movers to match their father 's ease , the height @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion without actually snapping the fingers . But their nonchalance is too earnest ; the effect is chalance . <P> The brothers close , " as a tribute to the man who made this act possible , " with an art-rending groan of When the Blue of the Night Meets the Gold of the Day . When Bing caught , or was caught by , the act out West ( he sees his sons only rarely ) , he said diplomatically , " You 're doin ' fine ; do n't change a thing . " With bookings piled up and the take-home pay close to $1,000 a week per man , there is no reason that they should .
