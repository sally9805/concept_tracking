The Fortune Cookie . Director Billy Wilder has taken the very rash risk in this film of spiking his big gun . In Cookie he keeps Jack Lemmon , a funnyman-in-motion who lacks the instincts of a sit-down comedian , sitting in a wheelchair that makes him seem foolish but never funny . With Lemmon immobilized , only a miracle could save the show from being as sedative as Wilder 's last picture , Kiss Me , Stupid . Fortunately , something like a miracle is at hand : Walter Matthau . A magnificent comic actor too long misused as a minor cinemenace , Matthau last year played such a spectacular slob in The Odd Couple that he made himself a major star of the U.S. stage . As the icing on Wilder 's Cookie , he should also be accepted as one of cinema 's top comedians . <P> Lemmon loses his mobility only two minutes after the picture begins . Cast as a CBS cameraman who is clipped while covering a Cleveland Browns football game , he wakes up in the hospital confronting the saurian sneer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ambulance chaser who , by the look of his crummy clothes , has been chasing them on his hands and knees . Willie 's skin is as grey as the towel in a night-court lavatory , but his ideas are crisp and green . As the cameraman 's brother-in-law , he loyally announces : " We 're going for all the marbles , kid ! You got a ringing in your ears and double vision . <P> Your left leg is numb and you got no feeling in the first three fingers of your right hand . We 're suing for a million bucks and we 'll settle for a quarter million-tax-free ! " <P> The hero protests that he feels just fine , but wily Willie reminds him that the big insurance firms have so much money " they run out of storage space - have to microfilm it . " And so for the next 100 minutes , the customers watch the illegal mind at work as an expert engages in a national pastime : swindling the insurance company . <P> Willie plays it noble . " To you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it 's just a question of money , but to me it 's a personal tragedy . " Willie plays it dirty . Before the insurance doctors examine his client , he needles his left leg and right arm with enough novocain to numb a mastodon . Willie plays it go , man , go . Borrowing against his hocus hopes , he picks up a fastback Mustang , a sackful of custom-tailored suits , a foxy set of fox furs for his fat-kneed wife . And when the insurance lawyers are ready to bargain , Willie makes them sit on wastebaskets and haggle like rug peddlers till in collapse they agree to pay his client $200,000 . <P> All the while , of course , Actor Matthau is leering , sneering , sniggering , swaggering , popping his optics , slopping his chops and generally behaving like the Nero of the Nuisance Claims Division . In the end , Willie receives a different sort of check from the one he expects , but until fate mows him down he offers what is certainly the season 's lushest crop of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
