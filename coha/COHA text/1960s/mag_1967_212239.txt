On Broadway a couple of seasons ago , Wait Until Dark seemed like a wrong number for Playwright Frederick Knott , who once dialed M for Murder . The thriller 's screen incarnation gives him a chance to call again . This time he gets through-with a better scenario , set and cast . <P> A photographer ( Ephrem Zimbalist Jr. ) and his blind wife ( Audrey Hepburn ) become the unwitting owners of a dangerous dope-filled doll . Three thugs hoax the husband out of town and then try to coax the heroine into giving up the toy . With mounting anxiety she keeps insisting that she has no idea where it is . To break down her story , the crooks concoct a series of elaborate disguises , posing as old men , young men , policemen and friends . <P> Eventually , Hepburn realizes that she has allowed herself to become a helpless victim of The Mob-trapped in her apartment , the phone line cut , the neighbors gone , friendless , sightless and alone .

Though the housewife has been sightless less than a year , she has already developed incredibly acute hearing and a sixth sense of unseen danger . Several times the gang leaves her alone long enough to call the police , the fire department or the U.S. Cavalry . <P> Still , Audrey Hepburn 's honest , posture-free performance helps to suspend the audience 's disbelief . She is immensely aided by the heavies : Jack Weston , Richard Crenna , and Alan Arkin playing his first straight roles-triple portrayals of a Peter Lorre-like psychopathic killer , a white-haired father and his smarmy son . With virtuosity , Hepburn and Arkin collaborate to revive an old **45;1665;TOOLONG has been out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in The Spiral Staircase and Sorry , Wrong Number .
