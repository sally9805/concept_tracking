Republicans , who had previously hacked out only a tenuous toehold in the South , last week went a long way toward making it a firm foothold . In addition to returning its first popularly elected U.S. Senator in Tennessee , the G.O.P. provided Governors in Arkansas and Florida for the first time since Reconstruction and may possibly claim a gubernatorial victory in Georgia as well . In 13 Southern and border states , the G.O.P. made a record modern-day gain of nine congressional seats . This year , moreover , many of the South 's leading Republican candidates were able to discard the Goldwater umbrella and run as bona-fide moderates . <P> The still-dominant Democrats also got a sorely needed transfusion . While such segregationist stalwarts as Arkansas ' John McClellan , Georgia 's Richard Russell , Louisiana 's Allen Ellender and Mississippi 's James Eastland were returned to the Senate with little or no opposition , a number of more progressive Democrats also won statewide office-notably Buford Ellington , elected Governor of Tennessee , and South Carolina 's Governor Robert E. McNair , who as Lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donald Russell resigned . In Virginia , the big winner was William Spong , the moderate Democrat who ousted Senator A. Willis Robertson in the primary . <P> The Georgeen Gambit . To be sure , old-fashioned racism still flourished in many contests ; yet many diehard segregationists covertly courted the new Negro vote . The Negro turnout was disappointing in several states , often because of the sorry spectacle of segregationist running against segregationist . <P> There were significant exceptions . In Texas , three Negroes became the first members of their race in 71 years to win election to the state legislature ; Georgia re-elected all ten of its Negro legislators . In Alabama 's Lowndes County , black voters-who outnumber whites 55% to 45%-were less than enthusiastic about Stokely Carmichael 's aggressive Black Panther ticket , which went down to defeat . Elsewhere in the state , several Negroes were elected , notably Macon County 's Lucius Amerson , 32 , a Korean War paratrooper and former postal clerk who became the South 's only Negro sheriff . In Dallas County , Selma 's public-safety director , Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voting-rights demonstrations , was elected sheriff over Incumbent Jim Clark , whose brutal treatment of Negroes shocked the nation . <P> The top race in Alabama , of course , was no contest at all . Democratic Governor George Wallace , unable to succeed himself , aimed to ride Wife Lur-leen 's skirttails all the way to the White House . Unless the Democrats or Republicans put up a sufficiently conservative presidential candidate in 1968 , George told a nationwide television audience , " you can look for us to be in your state all the way from Maine to California . " Ironically , the Wallace presence atop the party ticket helped sweep Democratic Senator John J. Sparkman , a liberal by Alabama standards and no admirer of the Georgeen gambit , to an unexpectedly easy win over Republican John Grenier , 36 , who masterminded Goldwater 's Southern sweep in 1964.
