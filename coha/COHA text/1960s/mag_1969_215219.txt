Is the National Council of Churches an anachronism ? Founded in a flush of enthusiasm 19 years ago to promote ecumenism and cooperative social action among Christian churches , the council has come under increasing fire lately . Critics-many of them inside the N.C.C . - argue that its cumbersome bureaucracy can do little more than issue position papers on current problems , and that practical accomplishments like its controversial Delta Ministry , which works among poor Mississippi Negroes , are rare exceptions . During preparations for this month 's triennial general assembly in Detroit , Christian Century predicted that the N.C.C . would see " a crunch of intense feelings and an unleashing of the urge to tell it like it is . " The crunch came last week in Detroit 's Cobo Hall . In its meetings , at least , the N.C.C . was clearly in tune with the national mood : the air was filled with accusations , polemics , threats , name-calling and disruption . For all that , the assembly still elected the full slate of official nominees , including its first woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , opposing her and incumbent General Secretary R. H. Edwin Espy with black candidates , failed . <P> Black Jesus . The reform program that some rebel councilmen had prepared for the meeting seemed reasonable enough . As shaped by Massachusetts Clergyman Stephen C. Rose , the program proposed , among other things , that the council become more of a lay organization engaged in specific social and religious tasks and that its white denominations turn over mission resources to the black and the poor . As a measure of its concern , Rose said , the council should also elect a black general secretary . Yet the insurgents never presented the proposals coherently at the assembly . And when the chance came to nominate a candidate , they threw their support behind the unlikely choice of the National Committee of Black Churchmen : Leon Watts , 34 , an articulate but little-known minister of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church . Even more unrealistic was the rebels ' choice for president-the Rev. Albert B. Cleage Jr. , 58 , pastor of Detroit 's Shrine of the Black Madonna and author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Jesus was black . <P> Red Paint . Beyond racial harangues ( including a shrill appearance by Black Manifesto Author James Forman ) , the more than 500 delegates heard a long , high-pitched debate on the war and the draft . After the assembly decided not to " accept custody " of the draft card of a 20-year-old delegate , Episcopal Priest Dick York of the Berkeley Free Church told the council that it had blood on its hands . York walked along the officers ' table , splashing red paint on their papers . Next day , however , delegates voted overwhelmingly in favor of a resolution defending critics of the Viet Nam War , and urged that the U.S. withdraw all troops by the end of 1970 , with or without the blessing of the Thieu government . <P> In the two contested elections for high office , Challenger Leon Watts was defeated by General Secretary Espy , 382-100 , and Mrs. Wedel outdrew Albert Cleage for president , 387-93 . A former vice president of the N.C.C . and wife of Episcopal Canon Theodore O. Wedel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare .
