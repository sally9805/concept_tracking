txt WASHINGTON , Aug. 10 ? ' The House and Senate passed the $46,662,550,000 defense budget today and sent it to the White House . For the first time , Congress also included a major fall-out shelter program . This was approved separately by voice vote in the House after vigorous Republican efforts to reduce it had been rebuffed . The bill 's passage was by voice vote in both houses . Meanwhile , the Pentagon announced a 25,000-man draft call for September , the largest since the Korean War . In a televised speech on the Berlin crisis on July 25 , President Kennedy called for $3,454 , - 600,000 in added military outlays . This included $207,600,000 for fall-out shelters . He said that draft calls might be doubled or tripled . The September draft qiin'a , Pentagon spokesmen said , t ? into account a recent upturn ' n volt.ntary enlistments in tae Army , Navy , Air Force , and Marine Corps . Earlier , the August call-up was increased from 8,000 to 13,000 . Average monthly quotas earlier this year hay averaged 3,300 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's final action by Congress followed approval by Senate-House conferees yesterday of the compromise defense budget . It exceeded President // Kennedy 's request by $265 , - 811,000 . The principal increase was made over Administration objections . It provided $525,000 , - 000 for continued output of the Air Force 's B-52 and B-58 bombers beyond the previously scheduled , cut-off dates next year . Accelerated development of the B-70 bomber accounted for an additional increase of $180,000,000 over programs sought by the Administration . These increases were partly offset by a House-proposed cut of 2 per cent in miltary procurement funds . In addition , thik compromise budget provided requested funds for strengthening Army and Marine ground forces and Navy anti-submarine units . It also provided for bolstering over-all airlift and sea transport capability for " brushfire wars . " The purely military sections of the budget went through both houses of Congress today without a dissenting vote . However , President Kennedy 's $207,600,000 shelter plan , already approved by the Senate , drew stout conservative Republican opposition in the House . Opposition Expected House opposition had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House had heavily cut civil defense requests . Some objections were based on the fact that only brief testimony had been heard on the shelter plan by the House Appropriations subcommittee and that the House had not voted earlier on the measure . It was understood that President Kennedy and dther Administration leaders discussed the problem last night with Representative George H. Mahon of Texas , the bill 's floor manager . White House support was subsequently brought to bear . This afternoon , Mr. Mahon opened the debate by conceding that , in the past , he and a majority of his colleagues had opposed major civil defense spending programs . " Saint Paul was on the road to Damascus , and he was suddenly struck with a great light which changed all his thinking , " Mr. Mahon said . In the light of the growing nuclear threat the House , too , had to change its thinking on civil defense , he declared . " It would be tragic , " Mr. Mahon declared , " if future historians should note that the House had failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation to survive a nuclear war . " " We do n't want to be too little and too late , " Mr. Mahon said . Representative Gerald R. Ford Jr . of Michigan , senior Republican on the House Appropriations subcommittee said that " we 're in a box and we 'll probably have to approve it . " Mr. Ford said he would prefer to reduce the Administration shelter budget to $190,000,000 . Mr. Mahon replied that the full budget total was no " magic figure " but as a " symbol of American determination , " it should not be cut . But Representative John Taber of upstate New York , ranking Republican on the House Appropriations Committee , then moved to trim the new shelter program by $93,000,000 . This is the amount earmarked by the Pentagon for survey and marking of potential shelters for 50,000 , - 000 Americans . According to Administration spokesmen , it is the " heart " of the new plan ' . Mr. Taber declared that the program should be left to local authorities . Shortly afterward , Mr. Taber 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nays " coming from the Republican side . The House members then approved Mr. Mahon 's motion to approve the full $207,600,000 for the shelter program . It was the first time since the Federal effort began in 1950 that Congress had failed to cut an Administration request for civil defense funds . Adding funds already included in the 0 . C. D. M. appropriation , President Kennedy received a record total of $294,150,000 for civil defense for fiscal 1962 . This compares with $619,000 , - 000 approved for civil defense from 1950 through fiscal 1961 . Meanwhile , 0 . C. D. M. officials confirmed reports that five of the agency 's eight regional directors , all Eisenhower Administration appointees , had been asked to resign by Frank B. Ellis , director . However , the planned transfer of some 1,100 agency personnel to the Defense Department and the unit 's transformation into a White House staff " Office of Emergency Planning " were still pending .
