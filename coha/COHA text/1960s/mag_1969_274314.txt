Italians loathe free competition , wrote Author Luigi Barzini , preferring to protect themselves by rigid organization . Barzini 's theory is especially borne out among old-guard Italian financiers . To preserve their power - and the value of their investments - they arrange for their firms to control one another through a cozy network of holding companies . Chemical-making Montecatini Edison , Italy 's largest private industrial corporation , was long the leading shareholder in both Italpi and Sade-Finanziaria , holding companies that , as it happens , control Montecatini Edison . Italmobiliare is 100% owned by Italcementi , an important shareholder in Bastogi , which in turn owns more than 10% of Italcementi . <P> As might be expected , many of these incestuous financial marriages turn out to be sterile . Prizing security above all else , Italy 's interlocked industrial and financial titans have been reluctant to take the risks that are necessary to stimulate the country 's economic growth . <P> At the same time , they have long wielded enough power to inhibit rivals from venture investment in Italy . The Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such interwoven ownership that their directors answer mainly to themselves . So few investors care for these conditions that the total value of shares traded on the Milan stock exchange in a year barely equals that traded on the New York Stock Exchange in a week . Worse , the system has begun to bleed Italy of funds that the country needs at home . During the first six months of this year , some $1.5 billion in capital went abroad in search of more profitable ventures . The outflow gave Italy an $897 million balance-of-payments deficit after five years of healthy surpluses . <P> Out of the Syndicate . The unhealthy financial system has come under attack from several fronts lately , as both the government and forward-looking private investors have sought to pry open the country 's long-closed business establishment . Acting through a state-owned investment bank , the government-owned holding companies ENI and IRI quietly bought effective control of Montecatini Edison last October . Once in power , the state agencies ousted both Sade-Finanziaria and Italpi from a syndicate of controlling stockholders because the companies were owned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of businessmen led by Cesare Merzagora , former president of the Italian Senate and now head of Assicurazioni Generali , the country 's largest insurance firm , challenged Bastogi , a big holding company in which Assicurazioni owns a major interest . Decrying Italian financial companies as " a group of hens nesting on rocks , " Merzagora 's group demanded that Bastogi try to stimulate private investment rather than keep its capital in the serenity of real estate holdings . Another group , headed by Insurance Executive Ettore Lolli , joined with Tiremaker Leopoldo Pirelli to oust the conservative management of La Centrale , a holding company that had most of its $200 million portfolio in real estate and food . The new management has turned La Centrale toward a more active role in both domestic and foreign investment .
