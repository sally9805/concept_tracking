txt President Johnson has decided not to sell supersonic F-4 Phantom jets to Israel in the near future , Administration sources said today . Israel has been pressing for the fighter-bombers since last fall . She has asked for about 50 of the long-range , 1,200-mileand-hour jets , the most advanced warplane in the American air arsenal except for the new F-111 , a swing-wing jet . International events and pressure from Zionist groups in the midst of a Presidential campaign could ,  --  the sources said , bring a reversal of Mr. Johnson 's decision . In a message today to the Zionist Organization of America at its convention at the Statler Hilton Hotel here , Vice President Humphrey reiterated his pledge " to support United States military aid to Israel , including Phantom jet aircraft , to maintain a balance of power in the area . " It was not known here whether Mr. Humphrey was aware of Mr. Johnson 's position . Richard M. Nixon , Mr. Humphrey 's Republican rival for the Presidency , declared at the convention earlier this week that the balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in : Israel 's favor . " Administration sources said the President and other senior Government officials have a number of reasons for not wanting to provide Israel with Phantom jets at this time . The principal reason is that Mr. Johnson wants to discuss prospects for an Arab-Israeli settlement and a limitation on arms shipments to the Middle East with Soviet leaders if a summit conference develops later this fall . Such a meeting appears to have been put off for the moment by the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia , but the President , it is said , has not given up hope of arranging a conference before his term expires on January . If the United States were to sell the Phantoms to Israel now , the sources say , it would reduce the chances of a summit conference and arms limitation . Would Reduce Tensions Further , the Administration dos not want to cause further tensions in the Middle East while there is a chance that Dr. Gunnar V. Jarring of Sweden , the special United Nations envoy , may arrange negotiations between Israel and the Arab states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy statement , warned the United States that its " pro-Israel " policy " may lead to loss of all hope for establishment of honorable peace " in the Middle East . There is a belief in some quarters in the State Department that Israel 's long-range interests would be better served by forgoing a temporary military advantage in the hope of a peace settlement . Israel 's need for the planes is also questioned here . Premier Levi Eshkol is understood to have argued in his talks with President Johnson in January , as other Israeli officials have before and since , that Soviet plane shipments to the Arab states have more than replaced their losses of , the war last year . Israel , the officials say , has1 been unable to replace her aircraft losses because of a French arms embargo and has been put at a disadvantage . Israeli Figures Doubted American officials doubt that the Soviet aircraft shipments to the Arabs have been as great as Israel contends . They also point out that better train ? ing and markedly better fighting qualities give the Israelis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While Israel may require the planes later if the French embargo persists , the officials contend the need is not immediate . President Johnson is also said to he unwilling to relinouish the diplomatic leverage that the prospect of a sale of Phantoms gives him with the Israelis as long as this leverage may be useful in bringing about negotiations between Israel and the Arab states . No Formula For Talks Although Israel has indicated a willingness to modify her previous insistence on direct negotiations , an acceptable formula has not been found . In a speech here on Tuesday , at the convention of B'nai B'rith , a Jewish service organization with Zionist sympathies , Mr. Johnson reiterated his argument that " how the talking is done at the outset is not important today . " With Israel 's Deputy Premier , Yigal Allan , sitting at the head table , the President continued : " But we must not lose whatever momentum exists for peace . " Arms Imbalance Feared Sonic American officials also feel that acquisition of the Phantoms might upset whatever semblance of an arms balance that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Phantom has proven superior to the Soviet MIMI in air-to-air combat in Vietnam . It Is also an excellent bomber , with a 1,000-mile combat radius , while the MIG-21 is a short-range fighter . In his statement yesterday , King Hussein said that Jordan had concluded a $100-million arms agreement with the United States that would provide Hawk ground-to-air missiles , which Israel already has . Two months ago Jordan received 54 United States-made Patton tanks and soon will receive two squadrons of F ? 104 Starfighters . The aid is intended to replace equipment lost in the Arab-Israel war last year , The United States has provided military aid and advice to several Arab states in recent years as part of its policy of maintaining a balance of power In the Middle East . Since both Mr. Humphrey and Mr. Nixon have urged that Israel be given the Phantoms , it would not surprise some officials if domestic political pressures finally brought about the sale despite the Administration view ,                  @ @ @
