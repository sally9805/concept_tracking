On the night of Dec. 13 , FBI men entered a flophouse in Bridgewater , Pa. , and arrested a chunky character named Ralph Charlton Hobbs . The G-men charged that he was one of a gang that last July stole ten paintings from the home of Millionaire Collector G. David Thompson in the Pittsburgh suburb of Whitehall . Hobbs was picked up after he opened direct negotiations with Thompson on Thompson 's no-questions-asked offer of $100,000 for the return of the paintings . In fact , to show his good faith , Hobbs had returned one Picasso ; the G-men. after trailing Hobbs for three months , found the other paintings rolled up in a mattress cover in a room at a Pittsburgh motel .
