All sorts of religious groups long ago seeded the U.S. from coast to coast with colleges and universities , but not until after World War II did American Jews get into the act . Leading them were seven Bostonians , all of them immigrants or the sons of immigrants , who sought a way to give thanks to the country where they had prospered . In 1946 the seven launched a campaign to found Brandeis University in Waltham , Mass. - the nation 's first Jewish-sponsored nonsectarian liberal arts university. * Seldom has a major U.S. campus blossomed so fast and so rewardingly . <P> When it opened 14 years ago , the school that bore one of U.S. Jewry 's most honored names ( the late Supreme Court Justice Louis Dembitz Brandeis ) had 107 freshmen and a faculty of 13 . Its plant was the defunct Middlesex University , a few old buildings dominated by a fake castle that Architect Eero Saarinen described as " Mexican-Ivanhoe . " But in naming a president , the founders made the happy choice of Historian Abram Leon Sachar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself as suffering from an " edifice complex . " <P> People , Not Courses . Genial , chunky Abe Sachar , 63 , found his ailment matched by Jews across the country . Brandeis was too new to have alumni , but generous gifts flowed in from " foster alumni . " They ranged from Crooner Eddie Fisher , who set up two music scholarships , to Broadway Producer David Merrick , who gave Brandeis a slice of Gypsy . Today Brandeis is a $24 million complex of more than 50 handsome buildings , including a 750,000-volume library and three ultramodern chapels for Jews , Roman Catholics and Protestants . <P> On its spacious , 260-acre campus along the Charles River , ten miles west of Boston , Brandeis now has 1,740 male and female students , 80% of them Jewish . From the start , it set admission standards at Ivy League level . With seven applicants for every place , it can boast that 66% of its freshmen come from the top 10% of U.S. high school seniors . <P> Sachar 's call for teachers brought a flood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course on the U.N. , bringing the immediacy of what " Franklin " hoped for it in 1945 or what U Thant said at tea last week . With his usual furious energy , Conductor Leonard Bernstein developed the music department . Archibald MacLeish , W. H. Auden and e. e. cummings have lectured on modern poetry . Arthur Miller taught drama , and Columnist Max Lerner commutes from Manhattan to give a course on American civilization . Says Dean Clarence Berger : " We keep telling students they 're taking people , not courses . " <P> To recruit its regular faculty of 240 ( three-quarters with Ph.D.s ) , Brandeis scoured the U.S. for bright young scholars on the brink of recognition . It paid well ; full professors now get salaries as high as $16,000 a year , and 39 endowed chairs are even better upholstered.
