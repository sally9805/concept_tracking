txt Salisbury , Rhodesia Relief is coming to drought stricken southern Africa . The richer Republic of South Africa is helping its neighbors , and heavy snows have finished off the long dry spells . But the snows are a mixed blessing . They bring moisture . But they also have blocked roads and prevented the shipment of grain to needy areas . Successive years of poor rains have caused malnutrition among thousands and decimation of herds of cattle and other stock . There have been great losses of income to families and nations . Fields have been hard baked , crops withered , stunted , or completely blighted in South Africa , Basutoland , South-West Af rica , Bechuanaland ; and as far north as Matabeleland in Rhodesia . Conditions are especially hard for subsistence farmers who live off the crops they grow and have no food or money reserve to fall back on . ? Bechuanaland has appealed to Britain , the United Nations , and other agencies for assistance . The country is expected to have to import 350,000 bags of maize this year compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Basutoland , whose cold , mountain reaches have been particularly hard hit , has received assistance from South Africa . . ? Some parts of South-West Africa have suffered from recurring droughts for eight years . However , money poured into the territory to build up African areas helps to provide work and funds for purchase of food . ? A Rhodesian freedom-from-hunger campaign has announced an appeal for ? 15,000 ( $40,000 ) tot-relieve distress and malnutrition , particularly in Mathbeleland in the southern part of the country . Hunger has political undertones in some of these areas . The South African grant to Basutoland comes just before a vital July 1 by election . Public works advanced . Chief Leabua Jonathan , head of the National Party , which is pro-South African , is seeking a seat in the National Assembly so he can become prime minister . He failed to win a seat in the April general elections when his party won a majority of seats . The South African gift at this vital time may have the effect of bolstering Chief Jonathan 's campaign . In Bechuanaland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken over in the last three months . Many political observers believe it is vital for the stability of the moderate government that prompt steps be taken to lessen the impact of the drought which has reached " disastrous " proportions . Already the Bechuanaland Government has taken action in addition to appealing for international help . It has moved up the timing of many public works  --  construction of darns , schools , roads , public buildings  --  to give work so people can buy food . A " crash program " of dry-hole drilling is being pushed in various parts of the country to provide quick supplies of water . Slaughter of cattle , the country 's economic mainstay , has been stepped up to avoid their death by famine . Fortified meal is being supplied to school children and pregnant women . A difficulty facing the regime is that Bechuanaland has no reserve for handling an emergency like this . It must immediately appeal to foreign sources . Long-range prevention In an interview recently , Mr. Khama said long-range plans to avoid similar disaster were being considered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide an irrigation development that would potentially feed the whole country . Another possible source of water would be exploitation of the Okavango Swamp , he said . The water could be used for irrigation of food and cash crops But these projects will take years while the need is now . Bechuanaland practically lives off its cattle . The national herd numbers about 1,300,000 . Last year 150,000 were lost to drought . This year some experts are concerned that this figure could double . Children aided In Rhodesia a school feeding program is planned to combat malnutrition among African children . Preschool children also would be helped through the schools . There are at least 40,000 children who need extra food to prevent serious malnutrition . South Africa also has been devastated in some areas by the drought , and there are many cases of individual and regional hardships . However , the South African economy is so broadly based that it can weather the siege . ? Its poorer neighbors are much more vulnerable .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
