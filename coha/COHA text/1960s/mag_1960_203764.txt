HOWARD JOHNSON <P> THE travel-weary U.S. motorist has been conditioned to think of food-and a chance to let the kids out of the car-when he spots a roof of bright orange tile along the highway . This " landmark for hungry Americans " is the trademark of Howard Dearing Johnson , a onetime cigar salesman who has become a part of Americana ( teenagers call his places " Hojos " ) by catering to the common denominator of U.S. taste and haste . Johnson , 63 , not only controls the world 's largest restaurant chain ( 607 ) , but has set up motor lodges in 24 states , now sells frozen and canned foods ( clams , chicken croquettes ) in supermarkets from Maine to Florida . This year 310 million customers will pour $200 million into Howard Johnson tills , $120 million of which will go either directly or through franchise returns to Howard Johnson 's family-owned operation ( including 296 restaurants ) . <P> Founder Johnson has turned the presidency over to his 28-year-old son , Howard Brennan ( " Bud " ) Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruises ' the highways in a chauffeured black Cadillac bearing the license plate HJ-28 ( for the number of his ice-cream flavors ) and a silvery replica of his soft-sell characters , Simple Simon and the Pieman , on the hood . He discovers half a dozen new restaurant and motel sites a year , claims that the success of his rapidly spreading motels is due to the fact that he builds them on sites that seem a natural place for restaurants . <P> <P> UNHERALDED and often unrecognized , Johnson swoops down on his installations , taste-tests meals , listens to customers ' chatter . If he finds a dirty rest room , an undersized portion or a lippy waitress , he may call up an executive in the middle of the night to dress him down . Johnson also occasionally samples Manhattan nightclubs with his fourth wife , but has sold his 60-ft. yacht , no longer collects paintings . " My hobby , " he says , " is to talk and eat food . " His favorite food is ice cream , which he stoutly ( 205 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eats at least a cone a day , keeps ten flavors in the freezers of his seven-room Manhattan penthouse and his $110,000 home in Milton , Mass . <P> <P> Grammar-school-educated Howard Johnson has good reason to love ice cream . As a youth , he sold cigars for his father around Boston , gave it up to buy a drugstore in home town Wollaston , Mass. , soon was $40,000 in debt . " What I really wanted , " says Johnson , " was to have a product I could call by my own name . " He settled on ice cream , made it attractive by doubling the butterfat content , using natural flavors , serving heaping cones . In 1929 he opened his first restaurant in Quincy , Mass. , lost money - but continued to add new ice-cream flavors and open ice-cream stands . He won the public with billboard ads of his son and daughter holding big cones and saying : " We love our daddy 's ice cream . "                @ @ @ @ @
