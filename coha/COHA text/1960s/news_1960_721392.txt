txt President , Osvaldo DorticOs Torrado announced today the seizure " within the next few hours " of the Moa Bay Mining Company 's nickel and cobalt plant in Oriente Province , owned by United States int*ests . President DorticOs also said Cuba , was unable to make " prompt and cash payment " for any of the properties seized or nationalized . Dr. Raul Rea of Cuba , arriving in San Jose , Costa Rica , for the inter-American foreign . ministers ' meeting Tuesday , dashed prospects for compromise in the dispute with the United States , saying Cuba was there not " to be accused but to accuse . " ' Pastoral Letter Endorsed In another development , twelve prominent Roman Catholic organizations issued a statement supporting the pas-i toral letter read in the Cuban churches last Sunday . The pastoral letter deplored what said was the rise of communism in Cuba . President Dorticds made hisl announcement on a television , program under the sponsorship of Havana University . The seizure of the $75,000,000 , Moa Bay plant , an action known as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company with the Cuban Government last Thursday . The company , according to an unimpeachable source , told the Government at that time that it felt the negotiations should be suspended because of the tense ' situation between Cuba and the United States . The plant is owned by the ' Freeport Sulphur Company of New York . The Moa Bay Mining Company plant closed last April after only a few weeks ' operation . The plant was closed because of the Cuban Government 's demand that a tax of 25 per cent be paid on exported slurry , a coarse by-product of mining containing sulphur , copper or lead . The tax created by Premier Fidel Castro 's regime specifies " concentrates shipped abroad " and the company took the stand that the ' slurry was valueless until it was refined in its $30,000,000 New Orleans plant . The 25 per cent tax is considered prohibitive by the mining industry of Cuba . As a result , the majority of the mines have closed . The Moa Bay Company found that the balance of $13,000,000 required to operate the plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for employes could not be ob tained from United States bankers . Negotiations then began between the Moa Bay officials and the Government on a plan to operate the plant , but little progress was made . There is speculation here on the plans the Government has for the Moa Bay plant . Since the slurry produced must be processed , arrangements must be made for a plant to handle the material . Cuba has a commercial pact with Poland covering the sale of nickel and mining circles here say that such a plant might exist in Poland . The seizure or " intervention " of the Moa Bay plant , rather than its " nationalization , " was a surprise . The possibility that it was a ' temporary measure was seen here because of the difficulty the Government would have in operating the plant , It may be , some observers said , that the Government is leaving the door open for further negotiations . The Moa Bay Company owns the only plant in . the Western Hemisphere that can process the slurry . In accordance with the procedure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervention , " of a property is decreed . Later Government personnel take physical possession of the property " intervened " and operate it . Afterward the Government may decide to expropriate , confiscate or nationalize the property . President Addresses Crowd President ** said it was useless for the United States to continue to talk about prompt payments for the seized plants . Only twenty-year bonds at 41 , per cent interest will be given owners of expropriated property , he said . So far as is known , these bonds have not yet been printed . Early this morning , Dr. DorticOs told a crowd of 8,000 in front of the national capitol that " in name of a democracy which is supported by the people , we have condemned North American imperialism to death . " The meeting ended the " week of jubilation " over the nationalization of the greater part of the United States-owned property in Cuba . The crowd took a mass oath to join the militia and to fight any invasion . ' The people swore to be grateful to the Soviet Union and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the authorities anyone they considered " counter-revolutionary . " Simultaneously with the meeting the twelve Catholic organizations issued their statement , in which they also called on Cuban authorities to protect churchgoers . The pastoral letter , in addiction to citing communism in the increasingly close relations between Cuba and the Soviet Union . Incidents at churches during the last several weeks that resulted in clashes between Catholics and pro-Communist groups were " provoked by persons outside our religious beliefs , " the statement said . Premier Castro has accused Catholics of provoking the incidents . Company to Fight Seizure In New York , the Freeport Sulphur Company said it would take all possible steps under Cuban and international law to protect its legal rights in Cuba . " As long ago as last NovemCuba , deplored the ? results of ber , " the statement . said , " we I informed President . Dortias that the Cuban Government 's drastic new tax legislation would , bring our project to a halt , and on March 3 we gave formal advance notice of closing as required by Cuban law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the course ? of ? these meetings , we made intensive efforts to reach a workable agreement , but ' were consistently faced with the Cuban Government 's insistence that we pay a 25 per cent tax on the gross value of our product , regardless of whether we had the income to pay it .
