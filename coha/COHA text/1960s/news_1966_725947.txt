txt It is little more than a year since John V. Lindsay was elected Mayor of New York City . Much has been accomplished in that year , and the basis of even greater achievement has been firmly established . Mr. Lindsay 's objective after his election was to organize not just another city administration but a peaceful revolution in municipal government . Revolutions , even peaceful ones , are inevitably disorderly and take time to show results . When all the old ways of doing things are radically re-examined , when every policy is challenged , when questions are freshly asked that old hands had thought safely answered , the process can not be smooth and quiet . This re-examination of basic issues has been very much worth while . Out of it has come a new spirit in city affairs . The municipal bureaucracy moves to . a new tempo of leadership . Passivity and torpor give way to hope . * * * For twenty years since the end of World War II New York had been putting up public housing and attempting urban renewal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual education budget had risen to more than a billion dollars , but the schools were doing a less effective job than a generation earlier . A Department of Air Pollution Control was created , but the smog deepened . A man of national reputation was recruited for Traffic Commissioner , but the streets became increasingly clogged . And so it went from one area to another . The problems had slipped out of control . New York had become the " ungovernable city . " Mayor Lindsay 's effort has been to lift city government from mere housekeeping to an entirely new plane . He has tried to stop piecing and patching and to start building a structure designed for a modern metropolis . He has endeavored to make the city 's present financial situation and future prospects clear , replacing government by crisis with government by plan . In less than ten months in office Mr. Lindsay has had defeats , has made missteps , but has also achieved an impressive beginning of progress toward his goals . Abandoning the malevolent fiction that " a bad loan is better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reluctant Legislature a graduated municipal income tax covering suburban as well as city residents . He has imported from the Federal Government a new budget director to introduce program budgeting and cost-effectiveness into the city 's fiscal planning . And although temporarily balked in the Legislature , he has begun the long-needed rationalization of the diverse transportation systems , easing out the veteran Robert Moses and confronting the politically irresponsible power of the independent authorities . * * * The chronic poverty and social disorganization of slum neighborhoods make up the city 's critical problem . Inheriting an antipoverty program that was a three-headed administrative monster , Mayor Lindsay has set to work to regroup manpower training , job placement , welfare and community action in a single administration . Similarly , he has reorganized the entire range of housing , rehabilitation and physical renewal programs . As a result , New York may soon at last be in a position to take maximum advantage of Federal help for urban areas . The hierarchies and the outlook of the Park Department , the Police Department , the Buildings Department , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been transformed by vigorous new leadership . Reform is on the move in New York . It is too early to tell whether Mayor ** ambitious innovations can succeed in mastering- the complex and accumulated problems of this giant city . Certainly there are many weary voices on the sidelines arguing that business-as-usual methods are still the best , and predicting that these high ideals can not be realized . But it is exciting to try a fresh approach on stale problems , stodgy bureaucracies and the bad habit of drift . A year ago New York voted for change . So far , it has decidedly been change for the better .
