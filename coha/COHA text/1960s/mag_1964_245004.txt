As quietly as their bellowing engines will permit , U.S. Navy and Air Force jets have been flying reconnaissance missions over Laos since last May . Their purpose is twofold : to keep an eye on the Communist Pathet Lao , who have been relatively passive lately , and to see who or what is filtering down from North Viet Nam along the Ho Chi Minh Trail through Laos and into South Viet Nam . Last week , three days apart , two U.S. jets were knocked down by Communist guns near the murkily marked " panhandle " where North Viet Nam forms a narrow corridor between Laos and the sea . One pilot died , while the second was rescued by helicopter , and a typical Laotian muddle ensued . <P> The Red Chinese and their Hanoi allies claimed that the " American air pirates " had been violating North Viet Nam 's air space . Washington officials maintained that the planes had been clearly within the Laotian border , stressed the fact that escorting jets had " retaliated " with guns and rockets against the Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars . <P> Whether there would be stronger <P> U.S. retaliation against North Viet Nam in the manner of the Tonkin Gulf incident remained to be seen . But on no account could the U.S. afford to stop its recon flights .
