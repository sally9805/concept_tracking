txt Washington The Arctic wind knifes across the Greenland ice cap at 150 m.p.h. with a temperature 50 degrees below zero F. , and down below in a fantastic burrow in the ancient ice , Army technician Walter Egbert takes a hot shower-886 miles from the North Pole . He sings as he takes it . How does it happen ? Nuclear power . Simultaneously at the South Pole it is summertime now ? good old Antarctic summertime when the temperature often rises above freezing . And here in another American nuclear installation at McMurdo Sound  --  this one 700 miles from the South Pole  --  Sergeant Jones quietly reads a paperback copy of Pride and Prejudice in the lower berth of the double-decker bunk , oblivious of the cruel waste outside . The place is heated , lighted , and powered by nuclear diffusion . There Are Even Nuclear Igloos These spectacular developments , like those in the Polaris submarines , catch the headlines : in the electronic age there are now even nuclear igloos . But a less showy use of nuclear civilian power is seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have far deeper social consequences , amounting to revolution in certain basic industries . In their report to President Kennedy , transmitted by AEC Chairman Glenn T. Seaborg , nuclear scientists and technicians of the National Academy of Sciences , Federal Power Commission , Department of the Interior , and AEC gave the following timetable of expected development of civilian use of atomic energy in the present century . Today  --  The 10-year civilian power program adopted in 1958 " is now on the threshold of obtaining its primary objective of competitive nuclear power in high-fuel-cost areas in 1968 . " The report notes that " six sizable reactors . . are in successful operation on utility grids ; seven more will be completed by the end of 1963 . " Breeder Reactors More Efficient The 1970 's ? Nuclear power will come " to a competitive status with conventional power throughout most of the country during the 1970 's . " The 1980 's ? Continued development " will make breeder reactors economically attractive by the 1980 's . " ( " Breeder reactors " are a sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an atomic furnace , once started , produces more energy than it consumes . Dr. Seaborg points out that current clumsy reactors can utilize only about 1 percent of the available uranium supply , whereas breeder reactors will be able to use " nearly all our uranium and thorium reserves " and will thereby " solve the problem of adequate energy supplies for future generations . " A.D. 2000 ? " We estimate that by the end of the century nuclear power would be assuming the total increase in national electric energy requirements and would be providing half the energy generated " in the United States . Fossil-Fuel Exhaustion Looms What will happen to oil and coal industries if this projected nuclear fuel revolution occurs ? Dr. Sea borg 's report gravely covers that contingency . Supplies of what he calls " fossil fuels " are exhaustible and irreplaceable , he says , and under current accelerating use they will be exhausted in one or two centuries . The present " fossil fuel " world gets a peep into the fantastic world ahead in the tricks which engineers are performing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of the installation on the Greenland ice cap . How is the camp fueled ? A packet of uranium weighing 43 pounds supplies continuously 1,500 kilowatts of electricity for light and heat that will last two years , in an installation good for 20 years . While this is all experimental it seems likely that nuclear fuel is so compact that it can be shipped or flown to regions in the world that have never had power before , with a revolutionary possibility that may transform whole nations . - The McMurdo installation in Antarctica is n't as big as Camp Century . But the installation provides another set of examples : the whole power plant was portable , constructed in a series of prefabricated , 15-ton " packages " that could be picked up and delivered by air . Of course , the fissionable material to run it is expensive , but so , too , is diesel fuel : by the time it reached delivery point in the Antarctic Rear Admiral George F. Dufek , USN ( retired ) estimates that it would cost S5 to Sfi a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
