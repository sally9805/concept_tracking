" We 're not going to be able to eat more hot dogs than Rockefeller , " said a New York Democratic county chairman last week . " We 're going to present a serious , dedicated candidate . It 'll be a campaign of contrasts . " It may at that . To run against ebullient Republican Governor Nelson Rockefeller , one of the few serious U.S. politicians who can smile handsomely with a mouthful of wieners , Democrats have just about settled on an earnest lawyer with rimless glasses , a furrowed forehead and a rumpled Brooks Brothers suit . The prospect : U.S. Attorney Robert <P> Morris Morgenthau , 43 , son of F.D.R. 's Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr . <P> Imposing Credentials . Democrat Morgenthau came to the fore in a curious way . <P> Last year , after New York 's Mayor Robert Wagner won re-election on a beat-the-bosses platform , it was generally assumed that Wagner would take over as the state 's Democratic boss-and be persuaded to run against Rocky . But Wagner hardly has the temperament of a boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no part of Rocky this year . The result : a vacuum of leadership within the New York Democratic Party . <P> Into that vacuum stepped Louis Harris , pet political pollster both to Jack Kennedy and to Wagner . Harris , who considers himself less a vote sampler than a political analyst , soon got to analyzing . <P> He was much impressed by the fact that Rockefeller in 1958 had been hugely helped by New York City 's normally Democratic Jewish voters . To win back that vote in 1962 , Harris argued , the Democrats needed a Jewish candidate to run against Rocky . Up went a trial balloon for respected Appellate Division Justice Bernard Botein ; it roused little interest , and down it came . Then Harris , as the acknowledged working head of a Democratic group that includes ex-Senator Herbert Lehman , 84 , Tammany Leader Ed Costikyan ( successor to Carmine De Sapio ) and assorted liberal lawyers and public relations men , began promoting Robert Morgenthau . <P> Morgenthau has imposing credentials . <P> If his family name has never yet set the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob Morgenthau 's background includes Deerfield . Amherst ( magna cum laude ) and Yale Law School-and a good war record : he enlisted in the Navy as an apprentice seaman during World War II , emerged a lieutenant commander with several decorations after having two ships torpedoed out from under him . Picked last year by Bobby Kennedy as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York , he worked up a series of successful narcotics , stock market and income tax fraud prosecutions . <P> Ironic Issue . By last week , with the help of the Harris group , Morgenthau was far enough in the lead for other candidates to launch a " stop Morgenthau " movement in an effort to block his nomination at the Democratic state convention in Syracuse two weeks hence . Their main charge against him , ironically , is that he is the candidate of the party 's " bosses " - like Pollster Harris .
