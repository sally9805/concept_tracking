In an incongruous interlude , U.N . delegates gathered in their auditorium last week to celebrate the 17th United Nations Day . The program : Tchaikovsky and Beethoven , played by the touring Leningrad Philharmonic . Before the concert , a grim joke made the rounds , to the effect that the Leningrad orchestra had canceled and President Kennedy had sent in the U.S. Marine Band from Guantanamo . In the corridors , there was much self-conscious gallows humor . A diplomat would say , " See you tomorrow - if there is a tomorrow . " Or " Uganda will be admitted to the U.N . Thursday-if there is a Thursday . " <P> There was both a tomorrow and a Thursday as , all week long , the nations angrily debated Cuba . The Security Council 's first meeting developed into a sparring match in which Russia 's vulpine Valerian Zorin and Cuba 's bouncy Mario Garcia-Inchaustegui tried , with ridicule and invective , to outscore U.S. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson . That night , 45 Afro-Asian neutralists huddled in a conference room below the Assembly Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showdown between the two nuclear giants . Someone forgot to turn off a public-address system , and their secret deliberations blared throughout the U.N . One gloomy listener said the neutrals sounded in private exactly as they do in public-breathless and inchoate . The conference did result in a plea to Acting Secretary-General U Thant , who thereupon started to work out a kind of truce . Then , two days later , came Stevenson 's best performance since he took his job at the U.N . <P> <P> Yes or No . Every word crackled as Stevenson sailed into Zorin for crying falsehood at the U.S. charge of a missile buildup in Cuba . " Let me say something to you , Mr. Ambassador . " he told Zorin. " we do have the evidence ! " He hammered at Soviet evasiveness and demanded an answer : " Do you , Ambassador Zorin , deny that the U.S.S.R. has placed and is placing medium-and intermediate-range missiles and sites in Cuba ? Yes or no-do n't wait for the translation-yes or no ? " The audience , transfixed by Stevenson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some nervous laughter . Zorin , genuinely startled , smiled too . Then he replied lamely : " I am not in an American courtroom , and therefore I do not wish to answer . In due course , sir , you will have your reply . " <P> Stevenson : " You are in the courtroom of world opinion right now , and you can answer yes or no . " <P> Zorin : " You will have your answer in due course . " <P> Stevenson : " I am prepared to wait for my answer until hell freezes over . " <P> No Score . Next , Stevenson displayed the photographic evidence of the Cuban bases . As big blowups of the aerial photos were spread on easels , he explained the technical details , adding that this evidence , and more besides , was available for closer inspection by anyone interested . Most of the time , the Russians stared stonily before them , ignoring the pictures . Zorin made one more try by citing some questionable photographs Stevenson had shown the Council just before the Bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has lied once will not be believed a second time . Accordingly , Mr. Stevenson , we shall not look at your photographs . "
