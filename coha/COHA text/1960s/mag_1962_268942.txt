Whenever their babies come down with the colic or break out in bumps , thousands of U.S. mothers turn to the unworried advice of Dr. Benjamin Spock . Yet Dr. Spock has his own anxieties , and last week they were written all over his kindly face as he appeared , with a little girl , in a full-page advertisement in the New York Times . Said the ad written by Spock : " I am worried . Not so much about the effect of past tests but at the prospect of endless future ones . As the tests multiply , so will the damage to children-here and around the world . " The ad , which cost $4,800 in the Times and is being reprinted in some 60 other papers , was sponsored by the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy ( SANE ) . Claiming 25,000 members in 125 chapters , SANE is the biggest of a number of organizations that have been trying to stir public opinion against this week 's resumption of U.S. nuclear tests in the atmosphere . Among these groups . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We Try . " It has not always been that way . After its 1957 founding ( cochairmen : Saturday Review Editor Norman Cousins and Quaker Leader Clarence Pick-ett ) , SANE became a haven for crackpots and leftists of all stripes . In its policies , it always seemed to condemn the U.S. while rarely criticizing the Soviet Union . Publicly denounced by the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee , SANE 's board was badly split over how to deal with the organization 's fellow travelers . <P> Finally , 37 far-leftists were forced out of SANE , the New York chapter was dissolved and reorganized with a screened membership , and the organization adopted a policy of criticizing the U.S.S.R. as well as the U.S. When Russia 's Khrushchev-insisted on a troika to supervise a test ban last year , SANE took ads to say : " We believe that such a three-man council , operating with a veto , cancels out the very purpose of control . " When Khrushchev later boasted about firing a 50-megaton bomb , SANE accused him of " an act of nuclear madness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " SANE coordinated the picketing of the Soviet Union 's U.N . headquarters in Manhattan by some 2,000 persons . <P> SANE has long argued for a " workable " step-by-step disarmament and a " realistic " test-ban agreement-both controlled by an on-site inspection system . It has applauded President Kennedy 's disarmament proposals ( Cousins called last week 's U.S. plan " imaginative , reasonable and responsible " ) . Says Executive Director Homer Jack : " We are not pacifist , and we are not for unilateral disarmament . We 're not fellow travelers and we 're not softheaded . <P> We know the problems the President faces . We try to be constructive . "
