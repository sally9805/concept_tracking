With Britain heading into its sixth economic crisis since war 's end , Prime Minister Macmillan and his Cabinet for weeks have been promising tough , bold , imaginative action . Home Secretary Rab Butler ringingly proclaimed that the government would " lead the nation in calling for moral values to emerge instead of materialistic appetites . " Accused of excessive complacency , Harold Macmillan himself loftily intoned : " When you hear the announcement , you wall not think we have been complacent . " In the House of Commons , Chancellor of the Exchequer Selwyn Lloyd portentously lectured that " none of us must be bound by old dogmas . " <P> Last week Lloyd presented the government 's measures . They fell with a distinctly timeworn , hollow plop . Among them : <P> A 10% boost in purchase taxes and duties on almost everything a Briton buys , from cigarettes and wine to cars and television sets . Lloyd estimated that the higher prices would give Britons some $588 million less pocket money to spend , presumably cut down on imports , currently running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average weekly wage is $45 , a packet of cigarettes will now cost 63 . <P> An increase in the bank rate from 5% to 7% . By making money more expensive to borrow , it will slow Britain 's real estate and building boom , help check the forces of inflation . <P> A holdback on government expenditures close to last year 's level , to be accomplished partly by asking NATO for help in paying the $182 million annual cost of maintaining British troops in West Germany . The government will also freeze wages in the nationalized industries to hold spending in line and avoid another round of inflationary wage rises . Lloyd expressed the rather wishful hope that private industry and labor would follow suit . <P> Stabilization of the pound in international money marts , by drawing some $2 billion from the International Monetary Fund-a whopping sum equal to Great Britain 's total contribution to the fund . <P> Tall Talking . The measures will get Britain temporarily over its balance-of-payments hump . But after all the tall Tory talking , Britons of both parties had expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had been braced for dramatic , tough new measures to overhaul the flagging economy . " Is there anything new ? " asked the Tory Daily Telegraph . " Where are the stern cures for fundamental weaknesses of the economy we were led to expect ? Where is the dynamic doctrine , the fresh stimulus that is to put new drive into the exporter ? " <P> In recent years Britain has slowly but surely been pricing itself out of world markets because of what the London Economist has acidly described as its " monopoly-influenced , trade-union-rigged , subsidy-protected markets at home . " In the last decade output per capita has increased a mere 2% a year , while wages and salaries have nearly doubled . The result inevitably is higher prices for British goods sold abroad and a consequent falling-off in the exports by which Britain lives . In ten years Britain 's share of the world 's export trade in manufactured goods has fallen from 26% to 16%.                    @
