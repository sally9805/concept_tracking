And they jumped up and down and hollered it . Poets from the Bronx , dropouts from the East Village , interior decorators from the East Side , teachers from the West Side and teeny-boppers from Long Island trooped into muddy Central Park yesterday for a noisy , swarming , chaotic and utterly surrealistic " Be-In . " From dawn to dusk , more than 10,000 people jammed the Sheep Meadow for the " happening " ( to squares ) or the " Be-In " ( to hippies ) with the single aim to express love to mankind on Easter Sunday . " Actually it 's a hip Easter parade , " said Sally Ordway , an off Off Broadway playwright strolling past two youths with balloons attached to their paislay ties , " Look at those hats , look at those helmets , look at those bananas that people are wearing . " They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on foreheads , paint around the mouth and cheeks , flowing bedshcets , buttons ( " Mary Poppins Is a Junkie " ) and tights . " I 'm wearing my wife 's cerise tights because it 's the one thing I could get in a bright- color , " said Bruce Maddox , a copy writer for Prentice-Hall Inc. , whose tights were bursting at the seams . " I did want to wear something different . " The " Be-In " was organized ? two weeks ago , after a San Francisco " Be-In " attracted more than 100,000 persons on Jan. 14 . The four chief organizers were James Fouratt , an actor ; Paul Williams , the editor of " Crawdaddy , " an Existential rock ' n ' roll maga-I zine ; Susan Hartnett , the ad-1 ministrator of a group called Experiments in Art and Technology , Inc. , and Claudio Badal , a poet-playwright from .

" We wanted to be a celebration of being alive , of having that ' experience in the park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , York do n't look at each other , do n't see each other , do n't talk to each other . " Affirmation of Love " This is one time they could do all that without being up tight or afraid of it , " he went , on . " It 's an affirmation of not being afraid , an affirmation of , love and happiness . " The four organizers raised $250 for advertising posters that began appearing in Greenwich Village , the East Village and Harlem . Two newspapers  --  The Village Voice and The East Village Other  --  and radio station WBAI-FM also advertised the " Be-In , " but word of mouth was the major reason for yesterday 's turnout . During the day , as youths in capes flew kites and girls with foreheads painted blue and chartreuse gripped balloons , hundreds of Sunday strollers stood at the rim of the Sheep Meadow , stunned , amused and dismayed . A girl with egg-shaped gold earrings and a crown of daffodils and chrysanthemums on her blond hair turned and said acidly : " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ? In my generation things were never like that . " The two men stiffened and walked away . A dozen feet away , hundreds of men and women were marching and shouting : " Banana ! Banana ! Banana ! " One darkhaired youth , sitting atop a friend 's shoulders , carried a twofoot wooden banana . Jelly Bean Offers " Everyone 's turning on to banana skins now , " said a 28-year-old Welfare Department employe . " It 's not as good as a pot marijuana high , but what the hell , the cops ca n't arrest you . " " Everybody 's offering me Jelly beans , " said Sgt. Murray Breslow , a cheerful policeman who stood just east of the Sheep Meadow . " I do n't take it because , first of all , I 'm not allowed to eat on the job and , second of an , I do n't trust the sugar they put in . " I 'm liable to go on a trip , " he said with a laugh . Not far away , Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stared at the crowd . Her son , John Jr. , began rushing toward a group of youths tapping drums and tinkling Indian dance bells . She gazed for a moment at the girls with " love " painted Da their foreheads , at the boys in robes , at the guitarstrumming , banjo-playing , bubble - blowing , balloon carrying crowd . " Fantastic ! " she exclaimed , leading John Jr . back to his bike and quickly riding off .
