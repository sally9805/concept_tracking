" Sports , " according to Cuba 's Educa tion Minister Jos Llanusa , " can not be separated from politics . " That 's an un sportsmanlike attitude if ever there was one , but what can one expect from a Communist from Havana ? Or , for that matter , from the U.S. State Depart ment , the CIA , the FBI and nine Cuban exile organizations , all of which sent operatives to Puerto Rico last week for the Central American and Caribbean Games ? <P> The objects of their attention were the 340 athletes of the Cuban squad , sent by Llanusa to win the battle for Latin American minds by sweeping the games for Castro . Not even counting the dozens of political commissars tag ging along as " masseurs " and " trainers , " the Cuban delegation was the largest on hand by far . The athletes turned out to be a handsome , swinging group-the men in white suits and straw hats , the girls in shifts of red , white and blue ( Cuba 's national colors ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were lucky , in a way , to be there at all . For one thing , Washington had ruled that the whole squad would have to have U.S. visas to get into Puerto Rico . Since the U.S. has no embassy in Havana , that seemed to take care of that-until a Cuban official showed up at the embassy in Mexico City to get their passports stamped . <P> The next problem was how to get to Puerto Rico . There is no airline service between Havana and San Juan , and the U.S. refused to let Fidel fly his athletes in aboard Cuban Ilyushins . Furthermore , warned Washington , any Cuban ship trying to land them in Puerto Rico would be seized on the spot . The Cubans finally made the scene aboard a Puerto Rican tugboat , which ferried them ashore from a Cuban freighter that dropped anchor just outside the three-mile limit . Their reception was warm indeed . Cops swarmed all over them . Shock squads of exiles followed them everywhere , trying to persuade them to defect . Officials turned up with telephones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already fled Cuba . A Puerto Rican bus driver , hauling Castro 's swimming team , stopped outside a house hastily labeled " Refuge , " opened the doors and asked hopefully , " Anyone staying here ? " There were even two major-league baseball scouts waving contracts at Cuban pitchers . <P> All in all , the U.S. spooks outnumbered the Cuban spikes two to one . But somehow they all overlooked Juan Pablo Vega Romero , an 18-year-old wrestler , who by week 's end was the only Cuban athlete to defect to the West . Juan Pablo had to manage his escape all by himself . Wearing a borrowed Puerto Rican sweater , he sneaked out of the Cuban compound , caught a bus to the nearest Catholic church . There he found a Colombian priest , who took him to a Puerto Rican assemblyman , who passed him on to a U.S. Immigration officer , who after a check with Washington , granted him asylum .
