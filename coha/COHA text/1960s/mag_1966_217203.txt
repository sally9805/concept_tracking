THE SOLID MANDALA by Patrick White . 309 pages . Viking . $5 . <P> <P> Only someone able to define to a child what a spiral is without moving his right index finger can properly admire Patrick White 's latest novel . <P> Only someone confident of his ability to demonstrate both a right-hand and left-hand spiral at the same time would have written The Solid Mandala . <P> Patrick White is such a confident contortionist . His double-spiraled mandala is the Hindu symbol of totality embedded in a glass marble , and his vast pretension is to spin out this bauble to encompass all human life in the person of its owner-an Australian half-wit half-man living in a suburb of Sydney . <P> The character who loses all his marbles but one is Arthur Brown , a shambling , boneless , orange-haired simpleton who works for 50 years as a grocer 's boy in Sarsaparilla ( a coyly satirical name for the Sydney district of Parramatta ) . Arthur is seen by his neighbors at the end of Terminus Road as a " dill , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " nut , " a " mophret " ( hermaphrodite ) , and " a dirty old man . " The reader sympathizes with these brisk Aussie judgments ; Arthur is indeed hard to follow as he mumbles about the place goggling at the dreary scenery or polishing that glass marble with the two spirals inside . <P> His mystery is compounded rather than made clear by the fact that he has a nonidentical twin brother-Waldo , a thin , superior fellow who spends 50 years working in public libraries around Sydney . Waldo is the intellectual type , so superior in fact that he does not deign to confide his thoughts to anyone , least of all to his dim twin . The thoughts , anyhow , are nothing much , but when Waldo retires , he will maybe get around to collating notes for his novel-Tiresias as a Youngish Man-which he keeps in mum 's old dress box . Tiresias was the shaman of Thebes , who had a prophetic gift as well as the characteristics of both sexes . Waldo gets into the spirit of the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Terrible Twins . One day Waldo dies " of spite like a boil burst at last with pus . " Arthur flees the house , returns after three days , and is mercifully committed to the local asylum . It remains for the twins ' twin dogs to prove that Waldo , if slightly incredible , is edible . Hungry dogs will swallow anything . <P> What to make of these terrible twins - " those two poofteroos , " as the contemptuous inhabitants of Sarsaparilla see them ? At first sight , it would seem that the old Confederate camp had moved to a last site in the real Deep South-Down Under ; that the old Spanish-mosstroopers of Southern decadence ride again in New South Wales . White 's celebrated style , in its sidelong , suggestive , subjunctive way , might nudge a reader to the conclusion that this is like early Capote or Tennessee Williams . And , somehow , White has contrived to convert a scrubby Australian suburb into standard Old South gothic . Moldering mansions are in short supply Down Under , but White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Brown house , wormy quince trees , and the house itself , which is a sort of Greek Revival temple done in clapboard . It is amazing what can be done with mutton fat , bad drains , and skeins from bowls of bread and milk to convey the squalor of life and the hatred of it that is proper to fiction of this genre .
