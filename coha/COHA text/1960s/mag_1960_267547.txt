TKE CITY THAT WOULD NOT DIE ( 280 pp. - Richard Collier-Dutton ( $4.50 ) . <P> At 1:40 a.m. on May n , 1941 , Police Constable Reginald Oakes was crawling in total darkness along a 12-ft. plank that linked two window ledges in London 's bombed-out Alexandra Hotel . At one window , trapped in the ruin of their bedroom , were a shoe manufacturer named Davies , his wife and two panicky daughters . At the other , Constable John McKenning did his best to hold the plank steady ; a concrete courtyard yawned 45 ft. below . <P> As Oakes inched toward the family , the gutted walls breathed ominous creaks , but that was only one of his worries ; his pay was sure to be docked for a broken flashlight , he later recalled thinking , and his uniform was hopelessly soiled - that could mean explanations to . the sergeant . Snarling directions , Oakes guided the Davies family , one by one , to safety . " Never mind my name , " he snapped . " If you 've anything to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cockney Courage . What a grateful family had to say about its rescuer was glowing enough to provide Oakes-to his immense surprise-with Britain 's coveted civilian award , the George Medal . Yet the constable 's finest hour , as British Freelance Writer Collier makes clear in his meticulous chronicle of a Saturday night during London 's blitz , was only one of many . Despite such selfless cockney courage , when the all-clear - blew , 1,436 Londoners were dead ; another 1,800 clung to life in hospitals . Nearly 800 tons of high explosives and incendiaries dropped by 505 Luftwaffe bombers had tindered 2,200 fires , gutted 11,000 homes , chocked 8,000 streets from West Ham to Hammersmith with rubble . <P> One more week of heavy Luftwaffe bombing , Author Collier argues , and London might not have justified his book 's ornately Churchillian title . The city had fumbled badly since the beginning of the blitz : fire-fighting brigades , their tough prewar ranks swollen by amateurs , were poorly coordinated , and water reserves were badly located . Worse , 35 weeks of bombardment had hardened London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night of the great raid , perhaps half the fire watchers were AWOL . <P> Why did the Luftwaffe fail to return the next night ? What brought on this particularly savage sortie , the last and worst of the blitz ? Collier can only make a guess . The night before , an insomnia-ridden Adolf Hitler had poked irritably at the log fire in his Bavarian mountain-lodge retreat ; a captive audience of Nazi underlings yawned in their teacups . Then Hitler 's secretary , Martin Bormann , and Pilot Hans Baur brought up the recent British raid on Berlin ; was not some reprisal in order ? Though every available aircraft was being readied for top-secret Operation Barbarossa ( the attack on Russia ) , Hitler foolishly agreed . <P> Stiff Upper Lip Service . The genesis of the raid seems to be the only assumption in a book crammed with first-rate research ; if anything , the spadework is a little too thorough . Collier 's " the day that " formula has by now become wearily familiar . His dense , sludgy prose oozes little of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiff upper lip service to London 's assorted heroes ; most of them seem as anonymous as the dust that clogged their lungs .
