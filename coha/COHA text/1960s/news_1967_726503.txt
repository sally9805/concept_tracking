txt Gaullism wo n't go out when de Gaulle does . No matter when the aging president retires or dies , and no matter who takes over , France will remain a staunchly independent  --  almost neutralist  --  nation . It will continue to resist c lose cooperation economically and militarily with the U.S. , though hostility toward America will decline . But post-de Gaulle France probably will relent in its opposition to Britain 's entry into the Common Market . That 's the answer that leading French politicians and political scientists now give to a question that has been asked periodically ever since Charles de Gaulle emerged from retirement to take over the nation in 1958 . Lately , the question is being asked more frequently . Now , as never before , Frenchmen are expressing doubts about the 76-year-old leader 's ability to handle his job . Many are angered and bewildered by his recent undiplomatic conduct in " Long live free Quebec , where he cried bee "  --  the slogan of extremists who want that province to secede from Canada  --  to French Canadians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gen. de Gaulle 's insistence that nations avoid interfei ing in each other 's domestic affairs . ( Yesterday . an aide announced that Gen. de Gaulle would go on , television tonight " to explain his policies and answer the questions Frenchmen raise on major issues . " ) When the change in command will take place is anybody 's guess . Gen. de Gaulle could remain in office until 1972 , when his seven-year term is up ; by then he will be 82 years old . But the possibility that he will finish the term seems less certain since the Canada trip . If he continues to outrage France . the general might be forced to retire because of the public anger or legislative or ministerial opposition . The Candidates Graceful retirement might not be completely unappealing to the man . For one thing , if he retired voluntarily he surely could play a large role in choosing his successor . At the moment , there are three strong candidates to succeed /c grand Charles . They are :  - -  Georges Pompidou , prime minister under Gen. de Gaulle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 56-year-old former school teacher and banker , is considered a pragmatic and capable administrator . Although he owes his job entirely to President de Gaulle , Mr. Pompidou is n't considered merely a puppet . " Frenchmen often consider him as Don Quixote 's practical Sancho Panza , " says Michel Brule , an astute young director of the French Institute of Public Opinion . Mr. Pompidou , known as a bon vivant , enthusiastically appreciates Parisian night life , Riviera beaches , French poetry ? and Charles de Gaulle . ? Francois Mitterrand , leader of the Federation of the Democratic and Socialist Left . Mr. Mitterrand , 51 years old , amazed France in the 1965 presidential election run-off by winning 45 , -0 of the vote against Gen. de Gaulle . Critics say he is a wheeler-dealer willing to work with anybody ; friends say he is a dynamic politician whose skill and hard work hold the often-fragmented Left together . Although his Federation has formed a loose , effective alliance with the country 's big Communist Party , Mr. Mitterrand clearly does n't agree with the Communists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet pursuits as gardening and golf .  - -  Valery Giscard d'Estaing , a former finance minister whose Independent Republican Party holds the 44 Assembly seats that give the Gaullist coalition its Assembly majority . Mr. Giscard d'Estaing , 11 years old , is a moderately conservative **31;1014;TOOLONG . He cultivates the image of a dynamic young man and works at a modern teak desk with a picture of him and President Kennedy nearby . He is an avid skier and is writing a book on Rembrandt . All three men have brilliant academic records , work hard and are considered pragmatic , highly effective politicians . By sentiment , none is nearly as anti-American as President de Gaulle , and some observers say Mr. Mitterrand and Mr. Giscard d'Estaing have strong proAmerican feelings . Follouing Public Opinion Whoever gets the job  --  whether one of the three leading candidates or one of a number of dark horses  --  probably will start with far less initial personal stature than Gen. de Gaulle did and will thus have to pay more attention to public opinion on specific issues . And the French public has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , think that France should side with the U.S. in the world power struggle , according to the latest poll by the French Institute of Public Opinion . In 1960 , the figure was 30% . At the same time , only 7r ; 0 think the French should side with the Soviet Union , a percentage unchanged since 1960 . The remainder want France to go it alone . This does n't necessarily indicate French hostility toward Americans as people . Americans who have lived here a long time say they encounter little personal anti-Americanism except from extreme leftists . " Those who get it mostly ask for it , " says an American executive here . But most Frenchmen believe American economic power in Europe is rising dangerously . This trend threatens European independence . they believe . At the same time , they believe that the Soviet Union no longer poses much of a military threat to Europe , so the protection of the U.S is n't as necessary as it once was . ( Few Frenchmen worry about any threat from China . ) As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't welcomed with open arms here . " I think we had to disengage ourselves from a subordination to the United States . " says Mr. Giscard d'Estaing This strong and rising belief that France must remain independent of " excessive " Americ an power will influence all aspects of foreign policy for years after the departure of Mr. de Gaulle . For instance , the French public generally supports Mr. de Gaulle 's actions both in taking France out of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and in developing an independent nuclear deterrent . Both programs probably %%ill survive Mr. de Gaulle . The same applies to President de Gaulle 's opposition to the war in Vietnam . While many renchmen consider it outrageous that he blames the whole war on the U.S. , they also want nothing to do with the situation . " It could lead to a war with China , and if we were closer to the U S. we 'd end up in it even though we do n't have any interests in the area , " says Georges Peannaneach , a university student . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the current war as futile , too . After a futile ** war against Communist-led insurgents , France in 1954 pulled out of its former colony of Indochina , N%hich comprised what are now the nations of North Vietnam , South Vietnam , Laos and Cambodia . Limiting U.S. Investments For the most part , France after de Gaulle probably will continue to allow only those American investments that clearly help France by such means as developing a poor area , advancing national research or boosting exports . " It is necessary for any country to own the bulk of its economy , " says Mr. Giscard d'Estaing . " The temptation of selling to a foreign investor reduces the chances of achieving necessary mergers within France . " Such mergers are needed to increase efficiency , he believes . " There may he some areas where U.S. ownership is too big , but we can use more American capital if it meets the right conditions , " says Robert Mitterrand , suave and genial brother and political aide of the Federation 's leader . An O.K. for Britain ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably will become increasingly united economically with the rest of Europe  --  including Great Britain ? after Mr. de Gaulle departs . At the moment , he alone is blocking Britain 's bid to join the economic community . " We favor British entry " into the six-nation Common Market , says Robert Mitterrand . " The British are definitely real Europeans . " Mr. Giscard d'Estaing thinks British entry would give Europe a larger voice in the world . And Mr. Pompidou is considered less likely than Gen. de Gaulle to oppose public opinion on the issue . ( The latest polls show 60% of the French favor British entry and only 13% oppose it . ) What 's less certain is whether France 's Internal political stability will remain after Mr. de Gaulle dies or retires . The ' ideologically diverse Gaullists are united mainly by devotion to Gen. de Gaulle and they could lose their unity when they lose their leader . The rival Federation also has its divisions and its loose alliance with the Conimunists makes everyone somewhat nervous . The Federation does n't publicly commit itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could bring Communists into the cabinet for the first time since the late 1940s . While French Communists are becoming more " respectable " and less radical , this possibility still bothers many persons and could foster splits in the Left . " Stability after de Gaulle ca n't be guaranteed , but there are new elements working for it , " says Maurice Duverger , professor of political science at the University of Paris and one of the nation 's most respected political analysts . One factor : In the new presidential election system , only the two most successful candidates in the first round are eligible for the run-offs . This has forced workable alliances between parties and simplified politics . There now are only five political groupings of any importance , compared with more than a dozen a few years ago . Candidates now know they do n't have a chance unless they can develop a broad base of support and wide appeal . Moreover , the ? . public overwhelmingly favors the current stable system and would probably bitterly oppose efforts to sabotage it .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
