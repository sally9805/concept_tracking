After six weeks as Premier of the Congo , Moise Tshombe was hanging on by the skin of his big white teeth . <P> Only the U.S. seemed interested in helping him hang on . It gave him a few renovated B-26s to help him against the advancing Congolese rebels . Assistant Secretary of State G. Mennen Williams spent five days with Tshombe in Leopoldville , left only after the Premier agreed to swallow his pride and ask five selected African nations to send troops . Whether they will remains doubtful . <P> Last Warning . Meanwhile , Tshombe hurled himself into a little cold war with leftist President Alphonse Massamba-Debat of the Brazzaville ( ex-French ) Congo across the river . The opening volleys came when each Congo charged that the other was plotting a coup . Issuing a " last warning , " Tshombe put his press aide on the air with the message : " If Moise Tshombe wants to take Brazzaville , it would only be a question of two hours . " From across the river came a shriek of rage addressed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced that unless Massamba-Debat immediately stopped supporting the Congolese rebels , some 50,000 Brazzaville citizens who live in Leopoldville would be deported . Tshombe 's object : to overload Brazza ville 's shaky economy , fan enough dis content to overthrow Massamba-Debat 's already strife-torn government . <P> It was a harsh and clumsy plan , * and Tshombe knew it . " It will be said , " he remarked , " that I am punishing innocent people . Nonetheless , I have no choice . " Half of Tshombe 's Cabinet and his secret-police chief , plus the U.S. and French ambassadors urged him to give up the plan , to no avail . The exodus began . Thousands of weeping Brazzavillians-many of whom had lived in Leopoldville all their lives-were shoved in groups of 150 aboard chartered ferries and shuttled across the two miles of muddy brown river to Brazzaville . With them were all the possessions they could carry or drag . <P> Bukavu Battle . Tshombe 's action all but obscured the Congolese army 's finest hour since he came to power . On the hilly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well armed and reportedly loaded with dope , crashed through the defenses of the European resort city of Bukavu , the government 's last major toehold in the eastern Congo . Promptly the rebels set up headquarters in the Hotel Royal Residence , took over the post office , and began rampaging through the center of town . Always before in such circumstances , the government defenders had fled in panic and confusion . This time , bolstered by 150 of Tshombe 's tough ex-gendarmes from Katanga , they stood and fought . After three days of battles , it was the rebels who broke and ran . Behind them , 300 dead of both sides lay in the streets . <P> <P> * Although African nations have been shunting one another 's citizens about for years . Recent examples : Gabon expelled 2,000 Braz-zavillians after a 1962 soccer riot ; Niger deported 16,000 Dahoman civil servants last year .
