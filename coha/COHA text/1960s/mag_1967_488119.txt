DJ- AR SIRS After reading " The Hobbit War " by Douglas J Stewart The Nation , Oct. 91 .. I find it necessary to tell a professor of classics how to read an allegory Neither J R R Tolkien nor Edmund Spenser was so stupid as to believe that good and evil " are in themselves the causes of events , " or that " their ' powers ' . . . can be deposited in possessed , unfree beings " Allegory works by portraying abstractions , which both the author and reader know are abstractions , as if they were persons or things . Thus Duessa in Spenser is not an untruthful woman , she is falsehood itself . If Mr. Stewart refuses to permit allegory to be a legitimate literary form , because it allows the author to say things that are not literally true , he should logically object to all other and shortei metaphors ( as some 16th-century Puritans did ) as falsehood , and wonder how Virgil could have been so stupid as to think Rumor was a winged creature with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is possible that the State Department and General Westmoreland have made the mistake of Don Quixote and can not distinguish literature from ordinary life , but I doubt that they are led to this by reading The Faerie Queene , Pdgtim 's Prayers , and The Lord of the Rings .

Thoughts on the Jubilee Few men are able to take a more objective view of the Soviet Union than Alexander Werth . He has never attacked the Soviet state because it was the fashion to do so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , few analysts have been more critical of Soviet faults and , because hatred was not the spur to the writing , few have been more convincing . Werth 's piece in the current issue is in that pattern . It is a pattern far from universal . For a time , the American press and officialdom took a moderate tone toward the USSR , but of late there has been a noticeable change . With the Johnson Administration under increasing pressure to stop bombing North Vietnam and to include the Vietcong in peace overtures , both officials and the press that follows their line have taken again to blaming their troubles on the Russians . This can only increase the trouble for all of us . The Hoover Institution at Stanford University held a recent conference , " Fifty Years of Communism in Russia , " which came closer to the truth about that country . Raymond L. Garthoff , a lecturer at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and a consultant to the State Department on Soviet affairs , said that there was much reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the turn to guerrilla warfare in the early sixties The half century since the Bolshevik Revolution , Garthoff suggested , " bears witness to the fact that the Soviet ideology , system and several generations of leaders have not been committed , or even inclined , to seek a military solution to the problem of the future of world society . " The Russian success with Venus 4 , repeating their triumph of ten years ago with Sputnik I , re-emphasizes the excellence of Soviet science and technology . Possibly the Soviets would have withheld announcement of this latest feat until November 7 , if the news had not been given out by the Jodrell Bank Radio Observatory , which the Russians had asked to monitor the flight . But they probably have other things in mind for November 7 ? among them possibly a new initiative to end the war in Vietnam . Such an announcement would evoke even wider world applause than the latest Soviet achievement in space . As for freedom of expression , it has certainly been hampered , but Max Hayward of Oxford University told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been able to achieve  --  fighting every inch of the way  --  a surprising measure of creative autonomy " The surest way of arresting further progress would be for the United States to intensify the always latent hostility between the two countries . To the same end , Prof. No J. Lederer , of the Stanford History Department , pointed out that " the escalating pressures of Pelcing have had a paralyzing effect on the Soviet political and diplomatic imagination " At the same time , the Vietnamese War precludes a serious chltente with the United States Another contributor , John Turkevich of Princeton , a chemist and a former science attach ? at the U.S. embassy in Moscow , did not regard the Soviet Union as a Marxist state but as a technocracy in which science , both pure and applied , has now become the dominant force . A similar view has been expressed by Dr. Donald Gould , editor of New Scientist , the British publication . After a visit to Academgorodok , the " science city " outside Novosibirsk in Central Siberia , Gould believes that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country 's future depends on raising the quality of its science and scientists to a level second to none . " True science , " he points out , " can not flourish under the corrupting and distorting influence of irrational and emotionally overcharged ideologies . The lesson of Lysenko has been well-learnt . " It would be well if we learned the lesson that Soviet-baiting furthers no interests except those of the cold warriors . The Real Dean Rusk Secretary Rusk , says one of his journalistic supporters , came out swinging in his October 12 press conference . The peace forces will welcome Mr. Rusk 's switch to open belligerence . Behind that bland , Buddha-like exterior there always lurked a China-hater and a cold-war general of steely determination . For those who remain committed to a military solution in Vietnam , and for that large number who are easily seduced by any exhibition of firmness , Mr. Rusk 's statement to the reporters was an effective presentation . The Secretary , however , has no monopoly on swings and jabs  --  he must be prepared to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dean surface at just this juncture ? In part , no doubt , it was because Washington is feeling a " drumbeat " of criticism on Vietnam ; as Ambassador Bunker is reported to have told the duly elected former war lords , Thieu and Ky , Mr. Johnson is in political trouble , and his trouble is their trouble . Another reason for the new Rusk stance is that all previous pretexts for our intervention in Vietnam have failed to convince the country It was time for a change . The new apologia does indeed come nearer to the truth than the earlier ones . We are not children , as Mr. Rusk remarked , and only children could believe that we are in South Vietnam to preserve the freedom of the South Vietnamese , who would perhaps rather die than live under communism but whose army shows a strange reluctance to suit the action to the resolve . Mr. Rusk is now driven back to the time-worn excuse of national security , with China as the menace to us and our children . But the Secretary had another motive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Fulbright was ready with further light on the matter . For nearly a year Mr. Fulbright has been trying to get the Secretary to testify in public before the Foreign Relations Committee . At a press conference the Secretary is fluent enough  --  no one can really challenge him . He is never at a loss for words on a platform of his own choosing , but before Foreign Relations he would be subjected to possibly embarrassing questions ; the verbiage might raE tvanoNIOctober 30 , 1967 419 not cover weaknesses In the argument . The Secretary of State preferred introducing his latest rationalizations , clad in new habiliments , before a less critical and more deferential audience . So now the arguments of treaty commitments , our God-given duty to resist aggression on behalf of our Vietnamese wards , our determination to teach North Vietnam to " let its neighbors alone " ? all these arguments , while not abandoned , are shoved to the rear to make room for the motif of vital national interests . A billion Chinese toward the end of the century , armed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rusk now subscribes . Mr. Rusk maintains that his yellow peril is not the yellow peril of Kaiser Wilhelm II or Madison Grant ; it is new , different and even more perilous , for now the yellow hordes have the Bomb . Never mind that the United States is overloaded , at home and abroad , with nuclear weapons  --  thousands of megatons in units large and small Never mind that half a million American troops are in South Vietnam and not a single Chinese combat soldier is anywhere in Vietnam . The heathen are still a peril  --  because Mr. Rusk says so  --  and we must contain them lest they overrun all Asia . So goes the Rusk thesis . Next week 's Nation will contain two searching analyses , one by Walter LaFeber , author of The New Empire , the other by Oliver Lee of the University of Hawaii . In the meantime , a likely side effect of Mr. Rusk 's new line is to saddle President Johnson with a new political liability . If national security is our justification for war in Asia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell-out ? Can we settle for anything less than military victory ? Do we even want the North Vietnamese to come to the negotiating table except to surrender ? If the President has any lingering thought of trying to reverse his field , for fear of an adverse verdict at the polls or for any other reason , the new rationalization for interference in Vietnam has made his course even harder . The Phrase Rediscovered In the most widely quoted words that were ever written for him , Dwight D. Eisenhower retired from the Presidency with a solemn exhortation : " We must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence . . . by the military-industrial complex . " The term caught on because it was a succinct description of a power structure of which everyone was aware , but which for most people was not well defined . In the form of three words and a hyphen , it took on concrete shape . Where hitherto the men and organizations that comprised it had been taken for granted as a necessary instrument of the cold war  --  and therefore beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger really exist ? Was it possible that the danger was already upon us ? Probably the most comprehensive answers emerged in the special issue of The Nation ( October 28 , 1961 ) by Fred J. Cook , which later became his best-selling book , The Warfare State . But soon the excitement died away . General Eisenhower , who had made the phrase famous , dropped it after that first utterance . Either he had rung a false alarmor he considered his responsibility discharged with a single speech or he hoped the phrase would fade away and trouble him no more . The people at large , glad to be relieved of the duty of attending to something unpleasant , returned to their customary concerns . The military-industrial complex itself was pleased to escape the unwelcome illumination that General Eisenhower , almost inadvertently , had turned on its activities . But now the phrase is in the news again . It bobbed up quite suddenly , as it has before from time to time , but conditions are now ripe for a revival of concern , what with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief escalator . Many who were silent are speaking again , and those who gladly ceased from troubling are once more troubled . Seymour Melman , of course , had never been silent . His book , Our Depleted Society , was in large part an attack on the " complex , " but Melman , after all , is only a professor  --  though one distinguished enough to have had an audience with President Johnson on this general topic . To bring the matter once more into the limelight , official position was needed , and so the phrase was given new life and currency , not by Melman but by another invaluable servant of the people of the United States , Sen. George D. Aiken . Some Senators from states with big defense interests are feeling the prod to support the war , Mr. Aiken said , citing California and Washington in particular . Murphy and Kuchel of California , and Jackson and Magnuson of Washington are quite naturally hawks , while opposition to the war comes , for instance , from Thruston B. Morton and John Sherman Cooper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " does n't have much defense industry , does it ? " He could have included himself with Morton and Cooper . Vermont has scenery , lovely old houses , marble and granite and ski-lifts , and manages without much largess from the Pentagon . Then there 's Oregon , represented by Morse and Hatfield , in much the same condition of beatitude . This is not to say that Senator Jackson , for instance , was born depraved while Senator Morse was destined from the start for heaven , but rather that Morse , with his inclinations , would probably have experienced insurmountable difficulty in getting himself elected from a defense state , while Jackson would be less militaristic if he did not always see at his back Boeing and all the Boeing workers and executives . Again , it is easier for Eugene McCarthy , representing Minnesota , to urge putting " some kind of limit on the power of the military-industrial complex to control the foreign policy of this nation , " than it would be if many of his constituents were living off the Pentagon  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executives of defense industry . Some top-flight journalists like Joseph C. Harsch and Fred S. Hoffman are speaking out with the anti-war Senators . Harsch notes that we are dealing with the largest specialized market place in the world . The current military budget is roughly $75 billion , to which , by Harsch 's figuring , another $20 billion in extra costs for Vietnam will be added . Not all of this is spent on weapons , but weaponry is bought and sold in the biggest single market in the world , and many of the sellers are corn420 THE maim/October 30 , 1967 panies which sell only to the American armed forces . A disarmed world would throw them into bankruptcy ; even partial disarmament would see many in financial straits , or scrounging for business in unfamiliar fields . Big and small business alike subsist on defense contracts ? General Motors alone lists 36,000 firms as suppliers , and nearly one in ten employed Americans is said to owe his job to defense spending . In this country , it is scarcely a metaphor to say that war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinister aspect of the " complex " is its managerial power . The Joint Chiefs of Staff have direct contact with the White House through at least one of their number , who is always present when Secretaries Rusk and McNamara confer with the President . The Chiefs are powerful men , and it would be remarkable if they did not enjoy power and want more of it  --  and believe devoutly that it is for the country 's good that they should have it . By them , and by equally war-minded civilians in the Pentagon , crucial decisions are made . The Pentagon is the most powerful managerial center in the world ; economically and therefore to a large extent politically , it is the major force in the country . Today it is incomparably more systematized and rationalized than in the relatively innocent years before World War II , and its power is more efficiently applied Thruston Morton , who is increasingly blunt these days , says that President Johnson was " brainwashed " into the Vietnamese War by the military-industrial complex . Be that as it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the war , and would be discomfited by its end . These interests are a force to be reckoned with , not only in endeavors to end the war but in the longterm preservation of American freedom from military dictation . Iv A Voice for the Voiceless m A complaint common among citizens actively concerned with the Vietnamese War is that they are politically powerless . They feel that the Administration , and hawks generally , are in a position to enlist those who respond reflexively to demagogic appeals to " support our boys " in a war against " atheistic communism . " There are indications , however , that the odds against right and reason ? are not overpowering . One encouraging sign was last year 's election in Dearborn , Mich. , summarized in a ? Nation editorial ( " The Dearborn Referendum , " December 19 , 1966 ) . Forty per cent of the Dearborn voters were in favor of an immediate withdrawal of U S. forces in Vietnam . In the more recent Cleveland Plain Dealer 1 straw vote ( " Choose Your Poll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sunday Charleston ( W. Va . ) Gazette-Marl ( " The Zinn Position , " August 28 ) Howard Zinn , ? arguing for withdrawal , ran far ahead of Rep. Mendel Rivers ( " Escalate and Win " ) , and Sen. William Fulbright , whose views occupied the middle position ( " Deescalate " ) . ? The Zinn-Rivers-Fulbright debate spread to Westchester County , the predominantly well-to-do suburban ? area north of New York City The Croton-Cortlandt News added a fourth option , and the tally went as follows : IHE NATION/October 30 , 1967 De-escalate 46 Present U.S. policy 7 The total is small , but it represents 6 per cent of the total readership , as compared with 1.7 per cent in Cleveland . The nearby Hastings News obtained a 5.5 per cent response , with 53 per cent favoring withdrawal , 36 per cent de-escalation , 9 per cent escalation , and 2 per cent present American policy . A three-way poll conducted in New York City by the Vietnam Summer Project yielded 62 per cent for withdrawal , 29 per cent for de-escalation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percentages being almost identical with those of the Croton-Cortlandt tally . One thing seems certain : President Johnson and Secretary Rusk can derive little comfort from the Westchester results , nor will the John Bucci Presidential poll in Philadelphia console them . Coming after his brainwashing statement , Romney led Johnson in Pennsylvania 54 to 46 , compared with 51 to 49 last April . On the West Coast a poll was conducted by the Clarke Press , a shopping paper in the greater Portland area , with results summed up in the October 4 issue . " The ' doves ' are taking over . " Fifty-two per cent favored immediate , unconditional withdrawal , 48 per cent were opposed . ( An identically worded question by Rep. Wendell Wyatt last June gave 17 per cent for withdrawal , 76 per cent against . ) Among other questions was one asking whether the National Liberation Front should be included as a party in peace negotiations . Seventy-three per cent said yes . The last question was . " Do you believe the war to be , as one leading critic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely unjustifiable American military intervention in Asia9 ' " Sixty-two per cent did so consider it . The unnamed critic , Sen. Wayne Morse , commented : " This straw vote speaks with the clear voice of reason and I am not surprised at its results " Concerned citizens are now attempting to get the issue of Vietnam onto various local ballots , as was done in Dearborn . This struggle is being waged in Willoughby , Ohio ; whether it is to succeed or not will be decided by the Ohio Supreme Court . A similar effort is being made in Boston . In New York City , two petitions have been submitted to put a war referendum on the ballot in the November election . On the City Clerk 's refusal to comply , the Fifth Avenue Vietnam Peace Parade Committee brought suit , on the ground that denial was an infringement on the people 's right to free speech . The usual basis of denial is that such propositions can have no " legislative effect . " In California this point has been decided by the state Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Traynor held that " the power of initiative must be liberally construed to promote the democratic process " The citizens of San Francisco will vote on November 7 on whether they wish the United States to withdraw immediately from Vietnam . The official ballot arguments of the two sides afford an interesting contrast The " yes " arguments are soberly worded Typical arguments for the opposition are that withdrawal would result in " the wholesale slaughter of ( Connnved on page 435 ) 421 standards of profit and productivity , that the manager is " neither managing men nor managing work . . . he is administering a social system . " That they have also taken good care of the economic health of Bell can not be doubted . The value of its stock has doubled in the past decade . If the recent FCC ruling has reduced its speculative attraction , it remains one of the most solid of the blue-chip combines . In spite of heavy transfer of plant costs from intrastate to interstate base in 1965 , the rate of return on its interstate operations rose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent by the opening of 1967 . The projection of return on the present basis indicates an annual rise of 1.11 per cent for the years ahead . Obviously if such productivity were not funneled off in lower telephone rates by firm regulation , it would make mockery of the whole concept of " public utility " and the theory that a monopoly 's plant is dedicated to the public use . A fundamental error of orthodox economics is the effort to fit such giants as American into the traditional market formulas . As John K. Galbraith points out in his newest book , The New Industrial State , these giants are self-contained social institutions . The AT &T; managers are not capitalists but an association of power men caught up in a highly intricate and vastly impersonal organization aiming at distinctive corporate goals . No corporation has achieved so complete an integration of its managerial class into its corporate structure as has AT &T?so; complete , indeed , that the outsider viewing its managers ' high morale , complete dedication and single-mindedness is tempted to speak of them as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its close integration into the functioning of government and society , the Bell system performs a function of the state and substitutes for state action . In this capacity public serviceshould be the guide ; the incentive to management in such a case must be a job well done and a public service met . The fundamental issue at stake in the current hearing is not the " goodness " or " badness " of AT &T,; either as to structure or management . Its peculiar structure is due to the American federal system of government , and the indifferent regulation of this unitary empire may be attributed in part to the divided responsibility for regulation . Its management is certainly dynamic and able . There may be ground rules for regulation within which the company has voluntarily operated , but as Chairman Henry admitted , " they have never been developed by a public hearing . " Certainly there is no overall policy covering the shape and structure of the communications industry and meaningful rationale of regulation . Probably it will take both Congress and the FCC to supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong to the commission . It is impossible to believe that a democracy will remain content with a regulatory body that does not regulate and a private empire operating under its own prescribed order .

Nightstick Politics Earlier this month , fifteen weeks after the event , the City Council of Los Angeles began an inquiry into the violence that attended President Johnson 's visit to the city on June 23 . Sworn witnesses , among them the wife of an aircraft company executive , a department chairman at UCLA and a television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assault by 1,500 police upon a crowd of 10,000 to 15,000 persons gathered in front of the Century Plaza Hotel to protest the war in Vietnam . A policeman struck the woman on the head , and another officer jabbed her 4-year-old crippled daughter in the back with a nightstick after the child had fallen to the street . Blocks away from the hotel , a policeman struck the UCLA professor in the back , and a half-dozen officers in the same area surrounded and clubbed a teen-age boy who sat in the street and offered no resistance . These instances , and many more , of unprovoked police brutality were not news . They had been well documented before . What came out of the inquiry was evidence that the violence was necessary neither to control or disperse the crowd nor to protect the President . The assembly was a peaceful political act intended to impress the President of the United States with the anti-war feeling of the demonstrators . The authoritarian response was the political use of police power to impress the crowd that the nightstick is more efficacious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
