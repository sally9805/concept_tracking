More than 13,000 rounds of artillery had pocked the ridge north of Kontum , and more than 100 fighter-bomber strikes had added their bite . But the three battalions of North Viet Nam 's 24th Regiment still clung to the high ground as Operation Hawthorne-and the first major battle of 1966 for the critical Central Highlands-entered its second week . <P> To avoid the heavy casualties of an uphill infantry assault , U.S. commanders devised a wily plan . While the men of the 101st Airborne and 1st Cavalry ( Airmobile ) stood back , poised to pounce , 900 tear gas grenades blossomed on the ridge to flush the Reds out of their tunnels and bunkers . As the enemy came up for air , the overcast and seemingly empty sky began raining bombs . For 47 minutes they fell in lethal , patterned precision , laying open the ridge in a giant surgical slash . The bombs came from 24 high-flying B-52s guided in from Guam by " sky spot " radar controllers on the ground . Within five minutes after the last bomb had burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . The scattered pockets of resistance that had survived the lash of destruction were soon wiped out . <P> Still continuing , Operation Hawthorne has thus far killed some 1,000 North Vietnamese regulars in a spoiling operation designed to throw off balance any enemy monsoon offensive plans . All up and down South Viet Nam , the U.S. has been out hunting in a record number of battalion-size or larger operations ( 25 last week ) . Significantly they are making contact , after nearly eight months in which North Vietnamese General Giap 's forces and the Viet Cong were notably reluctant to fight . Yet another sign of the quickening war : Giap has moved two fresh regiments from staging areas in Laos into the Central Highlands , the 34th and 88th , totaling some 3,000 men .
