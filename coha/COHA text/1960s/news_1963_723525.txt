txt A Czechoslovak physician who announced his defection from the Communist country and sought asylum here three weeks ago has left New York on his way back to Czecho-slovakia , The International Rescue Committee , which has helped resettle thousands of refugees and defectors here and abroad , , called the circumstances of his leaving " unclear . " But the ' Justice Department said in Washington last night that the physician , Dr. Jaroslav Kremel , had been interviewed by United States Government representatives . " He was uncertain about his future plans , " a Justice Department spokesman said , " and ultimately decided to , return to Czechoslovakia on a- voluntary basis . The decision was his " Dr. Kremel telephoned the rescue group 's resettlement di . rector , Charles Sternberg , last Tuesday morning . He said he was at the Czechoslovak mis ? sion to the United Nations and had decided to return home . That night , Dr. Kremel boarded an Air France plane for Paris and Prague at Idlewild Airport . Idlewild sources said yesterday that he had been accompanied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Czechoslovak United Nation mission ; two went with him to the plane , although they did not go aboard . Efforts to reach Ambassador Jiri Hajek , head of the permanent Czechoslovak mission to the United Nations , were unavailing yesterday . However , one ozeehoslovak aide said Dr. Kremel applied ' to return through the Czechoslovak Embassy in Washington . The aide said that " the picture he had in mind about the way or life here " had turned out differently . The Idlewild sources said Dr. Kremel carried what was called " a paper passport issued in Washington a few days before . " As late as Monday morning , however , he was scheduled to be interviewed for a job here with a professional medical group , arranged tor him by the International Rescue Committee . Dr. Kremel , who is 37 years old , had been chief anesthesiologist at the Vitkovice Iron Works Hospital in Ostrava before his trip here with a physicians ' tour group . On Sept. 18 , when he announced his de- fection , he said he did so because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! private life " in Czechoslovakia . Friencs reported that he had been to a party here Saturday night . On Sunday , they said he appeared somewhat depressed at being away from his wife and 2-year-old daughter , whom he had left behind when he came here . These friends questioned when Dr. Kremel could ever have been in touch with Czechoslovak diplomats in Washington . They said he was in New York Sept. 19 and 20 , being interviewed by immigration authorities , the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency . He was on Long Island that weekend , they said , and on Monday , Sept. 23 , he was " whisked away " to Washington . , There , they asserted , he was in a C. I. A. headquarters in virtual custody until Thursday , Oct. 3 , and was driven back to New York by C. I. ' A. members , arriving here the next day . He had been supported while here by the rescue committee , which is at 460 Park Avenue South , at 31st Street , He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin whom he had approached with his proposal to defect . Sol Marks , deputy director of the Immigration and Natural . ization Service , said yesterday that Dr. Kremel had come to the agency 's office at 20 West Broadway Sept 19 and declared his intention to defect . He filled out and signed that same day a form to adjust his status to that of a permanent resident . An investigation was and . was still under way , Mr. Marks said , looking to a hearing and decision . The lapse of time in the case was not unusual , Mr. Marks said . Mr. Sternberg told the immigration office Tuesday of his concern over the call from Dr. 1Kremel He suggested that Government authorities make a check . Few Checks Made Mr. Marks said that ordinarily there was no Federal check on the departure of aliens , except in unusual cases such as those of wanted criminals , when airlines and steamships are notified to prevent their leaving . There , was no immigration check on Dr. Kremel when he appeared at the Air France departure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticket on Alitalia Airlines . He changed this for an Air France ticket from New York to Paris and Prague on Flight 700 , leaving at 7 P.M. They said the three men with him had commented that Dr. Kremel had been a member of a doctors ' group that came here and had first defected . But they said that one day he had walked into the Czechoslovak United Nations ' mission and turned himself in . Leo Chime , chairman ' of the International Rescue Committee , said in a statement last night : " Dr. Jaroslav Kremel came to our office on Sept. 18 , 1963 , asking for assistance in being ' permitted to stay in the United States . Since we had no reason . to assume that his defection was ; not genuine , we helped him in t submitting the requisite application to the Immigration and Naturalization Service . " We were in the process of ! getting him placed profession. ? ally when he disappeared from his hotel room on Monday , Oct. 7 . On Tuesday , Oct. 8 , he " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Czecho-1 slovakia and that this was his own decision . " To - the question whether he was calling from the Czechoslovak mission to the United Nations , he answered affirmatively . On the undoubtedly correct assumption that the call was being monitored , no further questions were asked of Dr. Kremel . The call was reported immediately to United States Governmental authorities . " Without having reached any conclusion as to the , happenings of Monday , Oct. 7 , I.R.C. expressed its concern about the necessity that Dr. Kremel be interviewed by representatives of our Government . " Today we learned that Dr. Kremel had left New York Tuesday evening by Air France . We hope that this decision was voluntary , but the circumstanc surrounding it are unclear . " " We hope that the United States Government , since it was in a position to do so , established to its satisfaction that Dr. Kremel had left of his own free will . It is obviously of paramount importance that refugees asking for asylum at our shores be protected . While their freedom of choice must not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact rather than a conjecture . " Freedom Cited " The fact that , when he asked for asylum in September , Dr. Kremel was permitted to stay in this country , speaks for the nature of our society , " the statement continued . " But equally eloquent  --  and the point will not be missed by the 97 , - 000,000 citizens of the East European capitive nations  --  is the freedom Dr. Kremel had to change his mind . " This freedom to find sanctum ary in the free world ? and even to reject it later on stands in stark and dramatic contrast to the almost Insuperable barriers placed by the Communist world in the way of their own citizens , thousands of whom have died in trying to escape . " Only today , virtually buried on Page 43 of The New York Times , is a five-line report from Austria , recording the escape of a 22-year-old Hungarian boy who was seriously injured by a mine explosion as he crawled through barbed-wire barriers to reach freedom .
