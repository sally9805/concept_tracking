Judged by the sum of their special living allowances , bonuses and " hardship " pay , American businessmen working abroad are considerably better off than their stay-at-home counterparts . At least that is the conclusion of the National Industrial Conference Board in a report issued after a survey of 104 senior executives of U.S. corporations with international operations . <P> The report prompted one West German newspaper to comment that Americans abroad are paid " ducal salaries . " It has stirred a somewhat different reaction from U.S. executives in Europe . " I read that and gulped hard , " says Ed ward Roach , European marketing director for Honeywell Inc. , who is transferring this month from Frankfurt to Brussels . " Only if you 're willing to live like a native can you do pretty well . " The trouble , according to some overseas executives , is that living like a native often means squeezing a family into a cramped apartment and doing without some amenities that Americans take for granted . " The glamorous expense account is just a cross that leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says a Pan American World Airways manager in Rome . <P> Costly Commuting .

To be sure , U.S. prices are now rising at a 6%-a-year rate - considerably faster than prices in almost all European countries .

Then it was a way of inducing men to accept jobs in Africa and the Middle East . Today , the extras apply almost everywhere and sometimes add 50% to a paycheck . International Harvester pays its employees a bonus of as much as 20% to go abroad , and Pan American grants a flat $75 a month . General Motors expects its men to pay 15% of their salaries for rent , but the company defrays seven-eighths of anything above that level .
