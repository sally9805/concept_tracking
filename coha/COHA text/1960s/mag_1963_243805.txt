Three months ago , in a bitter end to a beautiful friendship , Poet-President Leopold Senghor of peanut-growing Senegal , on the West African coast , booted out of office his old friend , Premier Mamadou Dia , after Dia had turned on Senghor in an attempted coup . Last week , in a referendum run off while Dia languished behind the barbed wire of a military camp outside Dakar awaiting trial for treason , the 56-year-old Senghor legalized his position as Senegal 's strongman . <P> While pro-Senghor demonstrators chanted , " A single hat on a single head , " more than 1,000,000 Senegalese shuffled to the polls and handed Senghor a 99.5% oui on a new Senghor-tailored constitution . True to the slogan , the new charter scraps Senegal 's two-man , President-Premier system in favor of a single , strong presidency for Senghor . <P> The victory was resounding proof of Senghor 's support among Senegal 's masses , and it is made all the more impressive by the fact that he is a Roman Catholic in a 70% Moslem land . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeat for Black Africa 's most distinguished intellectual . For it had been the bespectacled Senghor who originally installed Senegal 's two-headed system of divided powers after leading the country into independence 2 years ago . Until he and Dia fell out , French-oriented Senghor* loftily ridiculed other French African nations that had chosen one-man rule . Now , whatever his continuing popularity at home , Senghor has probably lost some of his effectiveness as the leading spokesman for political liberalism in former French Africa . <P> <P> The brilliant Senghor 's intellectual credentials are impressive indeed . His much-discussed poetic works include Chants d'Ombre , Ethiopiques and Nocturnes . With Martinique 's Poet Aim Csaire , Senghor founded the mystic philosophy of " Ngritude . " Senghor was the first African ever to win France 's coveted agregation de grammaire academic degree , and he served with distinction as a territorial member of the postwar French National Assembly . By all accounts , he has been brooding over the political circumstances which forced him to end his 17-year friendship with Dia and take over as strongman . But Senghor was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . He is , after all , a strong admirer of Charles de Gaulle , and modeled his new constitution partly on De Gaulle 's design for the Fifth Republic in Paris . Perhaps with his mentor in mind , Senghor conceded in one of his poems that " absolute power requires the blood of the most dear being . " In any case , by week 's end he had grandly christened Senegal 's new regime , " La Deuxime Rpublique . " <P> <P> * His wife Colette , an attractive woman in her 30s , is from Normandy .
