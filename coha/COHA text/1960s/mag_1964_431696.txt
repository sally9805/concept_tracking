 | On a winter afternoon early this year , Jacqueline Kennedy and her son John visited the office of Mrs. Evelyn Lincoln , the personal secretary to the late President , in the Executive Office Building next door to the White House . " John-John , " as his father called him , is a lively , friendly three-year-old who had often visited Mrs. Lincoln when she worked in the President 's office , and he felt quite at ease . After telling her about his Christmas vacation in Palm Beach , he blurted out : " Where 's my daddy ? Have you seen him ? " Jacqueline Kennedy , with grace and composure , explained to her son that his father was not there and then quickly distracted his attention . Every woman who has to rear a small child after a husband 's death learns to expect that question . Only these women can fully appreciate how an innocent , childish question can stab the heart . Jacqueline Kennedy faces each day a lonely new frontier of her own ? the bleak , leafless land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it it is a familiar story , linking rich and poor , as Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs. J. D. Tippit , the wife of the slain Dallas policeman , were linked by grief on that November day . But each bereaved woman has to suffer the trials and the poignancy of widowhood as a uniquely personal experience . Now that the glare of publicity has dimmed , what kind of life does Mrs. Kennedy live ? What future does she plan for herself and her children ? How is the public likely to react in the coming years to this unusual woman , who changed overnight from a symbol of glamour and gaiety into a profoundly moving image of human grief and dignity ? She is , and will remain , a public figure . She does not seek fame or public responsibility , but fate has already thrust them upon her . A First Lady can become a private person once again after leaving the White House , as Mamie Eisenhower has gracefully demonstrated in recent years . But Mrs. Kennedy , as the widow of a martyred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the memory of her husband and his public achievements . This was her one controlling idea during the terrible hours and days after the assassination . This thought sustained her and transformed her private sorrow into an act of public homage . In so doing , she gave dignity to his death . His sudden , brutal murder , followed by the killing of Lee Harvey Oswald in full view of the television cameras , humiliated America in the eyes of the world . It made the death of our President , the leader of the free world , seem like a squalid episode in a gang war . Mrs. Kennedy 's majestic ,  | tearless grief restored to that death the proper sense of reverence and respect . Many writers were moved to compare her selfdiscipline to that of queens , ancient and modern . But when a king dies , he is buried as his royal ancestors have been . Age-old rituals sustain the bereaved queen in her public duties . The United States has no such prescribed ways of burying a President . Mrs. Kennedy had to improvise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she achieved was majestic , but it was a republican kind of majesty ? impressive and imaginatively worked out , but also essentially simple . In her reaction to her husband 's death , Mrs. Kennedy unexpectedly revealed herself to her fellow Americans . Millions saw and admired her true qualities as a person for the first time . She was not just a rich , pretty , onetime debutante with a flair for entertaining , but a woman with great strength of heart and spirit . The standard she set for herself was far higher than we would have dreamed of imposing on her . We suddenly realized that we had lost a President but had found a great lady . In the months that followed , she received more than 800,000 letters and telegrams , more than 1,000 poems , and innumerable gifts . Polls showing her to be the woman whom Americans admire most in the world further attest to her hold on the public 's imagination . She has become a unique figure who , despite her shyness and desire for privacy , will belong to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her life . Mrs. Kennedy is aware of this and wants to use her personal influence for constructive ends . In trying to decide how she can best carry out this unique responsibility , she depends heavily on the advice of her brother-in-law , Attorney General Robert Kennedy , the person she feels closest to in the Kennedy family . Their first major project is the Kennedy Memorial Library , which will be built on a site the President selected . bordering the Charles River in Boston . " I want the library to be a living center . I hope young people will go there seeking inspiration as well as scholars seeking knowledge , " Mrs. Kennedy says . She is also expected to join the board of the National Cultural Center in Washington , which has been renamed the Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts . Ground will be broken for the center on May 29 , the late President 's birthday . When completed , it will provide the nation 's capital , for ' the first time , with welldesigned auditoriums for a symphony orchestra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repertory theater . Since President Kennedy was much interested in improving the architecture of Washington and making it a more beautiful city , an interest that his wife actively shared , she may eventually accept an appointment to the Fine Arts Commission , which regulates the design of public buildings in the capital . In coming months , as she returns to a more active life , two other projects seem likely to engage her interest . She may give her name and efforts to a campaign to beautify America . Many people feel that this naturally beautiful country is becoming , in the words of one writer , " God 's Own Junkyard . " Slums , billboards , ugly neon signs , and sprawling , monotonous suburban developments are blighting the landscape . If Mrs. Kennedy were to enlist in a crusade to combat this ugliness , she might do as much for the entire country as her historical restoration project accomplished for the White House in just a short time . A second possibility is that she may try to stimulate children and young people to take greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising of funds to enable young , unestablished artists to perform before live audiences in schools and colleges . Mrs. Kennedy is already a model to many mothers who want to develop their children 's capacity for appreciating art and music . Her own mother always taught her that " the best gift is one you make yourself . " As a child , she drew an original picture or sang a song or recited a poem as a gift on birthdays and anniversaries , and she is passing this creative tradition on to Caroline and John . Publishers have besieged her with offers to write books , magazine articles and newspaper columns . It is too early for her to make up her mind about any of them , but , since she was once a reporter and likes to write , it would be natural for her to turn to one of these ventures . No matter how she works out her public role , she is , and will always remain , a proud , dedicated member of the Kennedy family . In the first days after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old friend , that she was horrified at stories speculating that she would live abroad . " I 'm never going to live in Europe . I 'm not going to travel extensively abroad . ' That 's a desecration . I 'm going to live in the places I lived with Jack . In Georgetown , and with the Kennedys at the Cape . They 're my family . " In her mind , the perpetuation of her husband 's memory and the raising of her children are interdependent . She feels that if " John-John " grows up to be a credit to his father 's memory , that will be the best of all memorials to him . By the same token , she believes her son can do well only if he is kept close to his Kennedy family roots . She chose to make Washington her permanent home partly because there young John is close to his uncles , Attorney General Robert Kennedy and Senator Edward Kennedy . One or both of them visit young John every day . Another uncle , Sargent Shrives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he is in the city . Dave Powers , the  | late President 's personal aide and favorite storyteller , comes by to play with " John-John " for a half-hour at lunchtime each day just as he used to do when they all lived at the White House . The men of the Kennedy family and their closest associates are resolved that the President 's son will not lack fatherly influences . Young John 's welfare is very much in Mrs. Kennedy 's mind even when it comes to the matter of decorating her new home . " I do n't want it to he too feminine a house , " she remarked to a friend . Mrs. Kennedy , who is of FrenchEnglish ancestry herself , has found that her husband 's Irish heritage is a link to him and an unexpected source of strength . In his understated fashion , he was deeply attached to things Irish . At his funeral , Mrs. Kennedy arranged that many of his favorite Irish airs , such as The Boys from Wexford and Come Back to Erin , be played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left for the cathedral . She changed the name of their country house in the Blue Ridge Mountains from " Atoka " to " Wexford , " in honor of the county in Ireland from which his great-grandparents emigrated . She has filled the house with the gifts and mementos her husband received on his visit to Ireland last year . The Irish pony that Sean Lemass , the prime minister of Ireland , gave young John is stabled at Wexford . Mrs. Kennedy recalls how delighted her husband was when Camline , on her own initiative , told John that he should name his pony Leprechaun . Mrs. Kennedy now lives in one of the oldest houses in Georgetown , which she purchased for $175,000 . It is only three blocks from the home she lived in when her husband was a Senator . Built in 1794 , it is shaded in front by 40-foothigh magnolia trees that were planted when the house was erected and which bloom for two months every year , from April to June . It is a tall , narrow , 12-room Federal-style house of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Kennedy sleeps in the master bedroom on the second floor , where she also has a library and a small office . The children sleep on the third floor , which has four bedrooms and two baths . An unusual feature at the top of the house is an enclosed captain 's walk that overlooks the city . As dusk falls , Mrs. Kennedy can stand there and watch the lights of Washington come on . There is a small walled garden in the rear of the house . Mrs. Kennedy describes herself as an enthusiastic but not capable gardener . " I am better at arranging flowers than growing them , " she remarks . As in the White House , she keeps fresh flowers in the rooms . Mrs. Kennedy and her children ad-@# here to much the same daytime schedule that they followed in the White House . Caroline and John join her at breakfast . She drives with them and the Secret Service chauffeur to the British Embassy , where Sir David OrmsbyGore , the British ambassador , and his wife have provided space for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House . The present plan is to continue the school only until June . Next September , Caroline will enter a regular private school . Most mornings , after dropping Caroline off at school , Mrs. Kennedy takes John to the home of friends for a play session . She and several of her friends who have preschool children participate in this arrangement . Back home by ten , she spends the morning working on her mail . She sees the children again at lunch . In the afternoon , she works on such projects as the plans for the Kennedy Library , and receives visitors . When President Segni of Italy made an official visit to Washington in January , he came by privately to pay his respects . Other important visitors from abroad do the same . When the children are up from their afternoon nap , Mrs. Kennedy plays with them for an hour or more . To those who know her best , Jacqueline Kennedy 's devotion to her children and her flair for enjoying them are her most important qualities . They are the part  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us tend unconsciously to picture a mother in terms of the **30;454;TOOLONG stereotype . A woman who sometimes wears pink Capri pants and likes water skiing does not fit this preconceived picture . But , in fact , Jacqueline Kennedy works at being a good mother with that special , shining intensity that she brings to everything that excites her romantic nature . She is a complicated , manysided woman . One side of her personality is an elusive , fey , childlike quality which enables her , better than most grownups , to cross the invisible distance that separates adults from the world of children . " Jackie has a Peter Pan quality . She can enter the fairyland where children 's imaginations roam . That 's why she 's awfully good with them , and at thinking up games for them to play and songs to sing , " a friend explains . YET , at the same time , as her whole demeanor during these last months of tragedy has made evident , Mrs. Kennedy is a strong believer in good behavior and self-control . She not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . When she lived in the White House , she worried a good deal that too much publicity would " spoil " them and give them false notions of how they should behave . There was , from time to time , a gentle tug-ofwar between herself and her husband on this point . She tried to shield the children from the photographers , while he , like all proud fathers , could not resist showing them off a bit . In the late afternoons , Mrs. Kennedy often takes Caroline for a walk through Georgetown , which abounds in interesting old houses and quaint shops specializing in cheeses , coffee , tea , spices and antiques . Even when she lived in the White House , Mrs. Kennedy used to take Caroline on unannounced shopping trips , and although they were accompanied by a pair of Secret Service men they were able to walk about without attracting embarrassing crowds . Now that she once again lives in Georgetown . Mrs. Kennedy finds this simple pleasure even more available . It is when evening comes and the children are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hours she shared with her husband . particularly when they lived in the White House . After years of speaking throughout the country and hectic campaigning , John Kennedy found he actually had more time to spend with his wife and family once he achieved the Presidency . Mrs. Kennedy also found greater satisfaction in her duties as First Lady than she had as an aspiring candidate 's wife in the hurly-burly of politics . Theirs was a marriage that was growing stronger and happier in the White House years . Then came the sudden emptiness . She fills those empty hours , often staying up well past midnight , by reading about her husband , sorting out his personal effects , and talking with friends . Her closest confidante is her sister , Princess Lee Radziwill , who spent a large part of the winter in Washing-  | ton with her . One evening , a few week after the assassination , Mrs. Kennedy attended with a few friends a private showing of a television film based on the book The Making of the President , an account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present said : " Her composure was remarkable . Her eyes have always had a liquid quality . and that night it seemed several times as if they were about to brim over with tears , but they never did . She was able somehow to overleap the recent events and relive 1960 . When the film showed Kennedy making wisecracks , she laughed . When he made serious points . she nodded in agreement . " Mrs. Kennedy is observing a year of strict mourning , which means no public appearances and no entertaining until next November . When that year is ended , she may travel for brief periods abroad . She owns a house in Morocco . the gift of King Hassan II ? a small . pink , Moorish-style villa in Marrakech. similar to the one in which she stayed for three days last fall during her visit to that country . There is , at some distant date , the possibility of remarriage . When her year of mourning ends , she will be only thirty-five . Intensely feminine , she is apt to be drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her natural distress that her growing children have no father may also impel her in this direction . A friend said recently , " If Jackie remarries ? and of course this is the furthest thing from her mind at the moment ? I would expect that she would marry an older man who in some ways resembled President Kennedy . That is , a wealthy , cultivated man , perhaps a patron of the arts , interested in public service . But I do n't think she would marry another political activist . She has had enough of the experience of sharing her husband with politics . " For the immediate years ahead , rediscovering private happiness will not be Mrs. Kennedy 's primary concern . She will stay in the public limelight as a President 's widow devoted to preserving his memory and to using her own influence in worthy causes . It is hard for her to fulfill this demanding public role , but it is what she thinks her country asks of her . The millions of Americans who admire her gallantry so much can best reciprocate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and small , that they recognize need doing but which they find hard to do . The future of Mrs. Kennedy may demonstrate that she has the greatest power of all -- the power of good example .
