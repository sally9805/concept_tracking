Over morning coffee , Bonn celebrated the first day P.A.-Post-Adenauer . Almost in disbelief , politicians of all parties concluded that West Germany 's fourth postwar election had finally scuttled the Old Chancellor . Angrily , Konrad Adenauer vented his rage on campaign officials , the Socialists , the U.S. ( for not allowing him to accompany Lyndon Johnson to Berlin , which would have been great campaign publicity ) . When he announced a press conference for noon , friends and foes alike guessed that der Alte was about to step down . Instead , the Old Fox left no doubt that in West Germany it was still Anno Adenauer . <P> Back to Success . Adenauer 's Christian Democrats had lost 27 of their 270 seats in the Bundestag , well short of the absolute majority the Chancellor had vowed to retain . With Berlin 's spirited Mayor Willy Brandt as their candidate , the Socialists only topped their 1957 vote by a meager 4.5% , wound up with 190 seats . The election 's sole victors turned out to be Erich Mende 's Free Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match with Brandt , the Free Democrats had quietly recruited fugitives from both major parties , wound up with nearly double their 1957 vote and the prize of 66 Bundestag seats ( up 25 ) . <P> But at his press conference , the bright-eyed , firm-lipped , 85-year-old titan blandly assured reporters that his party had " sound wood and good roots " ( a judgment that applies equally to Adenauer , who acts a young 65 ) . The Christian Democrats , he deadpanned , had merely " slipped back to our success of 1953 , " when they also had exactly 243 seats . Said he : " When one party has been leading the country for twelve years , naturally it could not fulfill all wishes . Thus a certain dissatisfaction arises . " <P> On to Coalition . Dissatisfactions go deeper than der Alte cared to admit . Some critics feel that so long a reign as his may stifle their young democracy . The Socialists captured a high percentage of the country 's first-time voters , while the Free Democrats winkled off a sizable number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erhard as the engineer of prosperity and vehemently resent Adenauer 's underhand attempts to keep their hero in the shadows . Said a party official : " Plenty of our voters felt that in voting for us they were voting against Adenauer for Erhard . " <P> In view of these discontents and the Christian Democrats ' minority position in the Bundestag , politicians continued to argue that Adenauer ought to step down to make way for a younger man-and federal President Heinrich Lbke has warned that he will not inaugurate the Chancellor if he tries to rule with a minority government . Moving in for what he hoped would be the kill , wily Defense Minister Franz Josef Strauss took to TV to announce that his own 50-man Bavarian wing of the party-which fared respectably at the polls-had decided that der Alte should be succeeded by Erhard . Strauss 's critics say that he hopes Erhard will serve briefly as transitional Chancellor , perform badly in foreign affairs , and thus clear the way for Strauss himself .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
