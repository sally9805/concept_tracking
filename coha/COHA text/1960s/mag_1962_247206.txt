It was a big political week-like in a big political year . Pageantry ran high , and so did passion . Big names were on the line ; big decisions were made , at the polls and in convention halls . <P> In California , Richard Nixon , the man who lost the presidency by the barest of margins , ran with the same intensity for the right to run for the lesser office of Governor . In Massachusetts , the Kennedy family , unafraid of the slings and arrows from lesser breeds , proudly ran its youngest son through a convention gauntlet , and saw him emerge the victor . The loser was kin to the Speaker of the House , but no matter-the Kennedys know how to win and patch up . In Connecticut , always considered a bellwether state , no fewer than six Republicans spent lavishly of their blood , sweat and cash , and fought through eight ballots at a party convention for the chance to be the man who might beat a Democratic Governor in November . <P> But there is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are principles , and stands , and statements of belief . In a pragmatic America , these principles and beliefs are usually stated-in fact , acted out-in the day-to-day clash of men in Congress , where votes are cast , as well as speeches made . But every once in a while there is a need for a summing up , or a restatement of belief . Not immutable principles or irrevocable doctrines , but some facts and opinions to fuel the arguments and feed the discussions in the immediate future . <P> Such a time had come for the Republican Party , whose Congressional members felt that there was altogether too much attention , publicity , image-building and all that jazz emanating from the skilled practitioner in the White House . What the Republicans did , naturally , was to set up a committee . It consisted of six Senators and six Representatives , and was led by Wisconsin 's energetic Congressman Melvin R. Laird , 39 . <P> A skilled veteran of four Republican Convention platform fights , Laird drove the committee hard in twice-weekly meetings . He solicited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , showed a 4,000-word draft to Dwight Eisenhower , accepted some of Ike 's ideas verbatim , followed the ex-President 's advice to cut the document to 2,500 words . <P> Laird 's statement had the conventional weaknesses of party platforms in America .
