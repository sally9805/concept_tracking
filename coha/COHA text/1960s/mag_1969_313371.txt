Unwed mothers are often condemned by legislators and the public as women of easy morals who spend the rest of their lives promiscuously producing illegitimate children for the welfare rolls . Partly true ; partly not . According to a recent study of 205 New York City mothers ( 10% of them white ) , which was reported last week at the National Conference on Social Welfare , fewer than half of them turn out that way . As Mignon Sauber , research director of the Community Council of Greater New York , points out , the conventional picture of these women is vastly exaggerated . <P> More than half the mothers in her study eventually married , and despite the stereotype of the fatherless slum family , half of them were still in touch with the first child 's father or living with him . Although half the women were less than 20 years old when they had their first child , close to a third had no other children . Nearly half the mothers were not on welfare at the time the survey was made ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or longer . And as for blatant immorality , the statistical evidence , although not clear-cut , points the other way : three-fourths of those who had more children were made pregnant by the man who fathered their first child or the man they married later , and only 4% of the girls became pregnant by as many as three different men .
