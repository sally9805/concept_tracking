South Viet Nam 's sprawling Mekong Delta is a military planner 's nightmare . May-to-October monsoon rains churn the paddyfields into oceans of viscous slop that bogs down troopers and tanks alike . But for all its unpleasant mud , the Delta is far too vital to be ignored . It is the home of one-third of South Viet Nam 's 16.5 million people , produces fully one-half of the country 's food . It is also infested with Viet Cong . As long as the U.S. has concentrated most of its military muscle in other areas , the V.C. have been able to use it as their main source of new recruits and food . Last week , even as U.S. planes hit North Viet Nam with a record 197 missions in a single day , U.S. forces went into the Delta in earnest . <P> Square in the Middle . Primary target was a stretch of Route 4 , a potholed two-lane highway over which moves most of the food that the Delta now sends to Saigon . Explained Lieut . General Frederick C. Weyand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road is closed , the price of rice in Saigon goes up 10 piasters 20 . " In the past fortnight , the Viet Cong concentrated three hard-core battalions near Route 4 and mined the road eight times , bringing traffic to a virtual stop . The V.C. were obviously trying to push up food prices just as the presidential campaign began . <P> In a combined American-Vietnamese sweep called Coronado II , four battalions from the 9th and 25th Divisions were helilifted into the area ; two others swarmed ashore from river as sault boats . The Americans ' job was to link up with ten South Vietnamese battalions to make a 250-sq. - mi. rectangle surrounding the V.C. battalions . While the perimeter formed , two battalions of tough South Vietnamese Marines came clattering in by copter to flush out the quarry . By chance , the Marines landed squarely in the midst of a crack V.C. outfit . At once they were in a furious firefight and the Marine commander stubbornly waved off U.S. artillery fire and air strikes so that he could keep his own men in close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonstop righting , the V.C. broke off to slip away by night . They left behind 150 dead and a number of prisoners , including the battalion 's deputy commander . Along the rectangle 's rim , U.S. and South Vietnamese troopers killed 135 other guerrillas , blew up nearly 700 bunkers.
