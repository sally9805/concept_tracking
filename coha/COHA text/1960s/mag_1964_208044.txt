Last summer , when Detroit 's pressmen walked off the city 's two papers , the Free Press and the News , one of the more interested observers was a 23-year-old graduate student in economics at Detroit 's Wayne State University . Michael Gordon Dworkin 's journalistic experience was meager ; in years past he had logged a little time on Wayne State 's student paper , the Daily Collegian . But he did not lack for nerve . If the shutdown lasted long enough , he decided , an interim daily might make its publisher some real money . On the strength of his decision . Student Dworkin went into the newspaper business . <P> Paying Off . Instead of looking for experienced partners , who might have dissuaded him . Detroit 's journalistic entrepreneur talked three buddies into joining him . Instead of appealing for funds to bankers , who would probably have turned him down , he appealed to Irving Hershman , a softhearted cousin with means . Jimmy Hoffa 's perennially hungry teamsters helped out by agreeing to deliver Dworkin 's nonexistent daily on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first sneered at Dworkin 's proffered business , soon accepted it gratefully . From abruptly laid-off newspaper salesmen , the neophyte publisher put together a willing business staff . And finally , when all else was in place , he got the professional talent he desperately needed : unemployed editorial staffers from the Free Press . <P> Just ten days after the Free Press and <P> News were struck , the Detroit Daily Press hit the streets . It was at the time scarcely worth its price of 100 ; it was a tangle of printer 's errors , garbled copy , unscannable headlines and whole pages run upside down . Unable to subscribe to a domestic wire service , the Daily Press limped along with a British import , Reuters Ltd. , and the Dow-Jones ticker . It cribbed unabashedly from radio newscasts , engraved photos snapped directly from the TV tube . <P> But within three days of its birth , the Daily Press had retired Cousin Irving 's loan . And as Detroit 's longest newspaper shutdown wore on , the paper developed professional competence . In time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of them borrowed from the silenced Free Press . <P> Correspondents all over the country sent in copy , at space rates . A moonlighting Washington newsman supplied a Capital column , whimsically bylined G. Schenk Gott ( " God 's gift " in idiomatic German ) . The Daily Press sent a man to follow Republican Presidential Candidate Goldwater about the country , another staffer to cover the Ecumenical Conference in the Vatican . When the Warren Commission report became available . Dworkin flew a reporter to Washington for a copy , published 13,000 words of summary text . <P> Scolding Its Readers . Editorially , Dworkin 's Daily Press lined up with the majority and backed the Democrats . It also opposed pay raises for Wayne County ( Detroit ) elective officials , and it fought a referendum issue granting Detroit homeowners the right not to sell their property to anyone they considered undesirable . When the referendum passed anyway , the Daily Press scolded voters roundly .
