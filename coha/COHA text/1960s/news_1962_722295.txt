txt The mounting election-year campaign to authorize a state bonus for Korean War veterans is expected to reach a peak in the Legislature this week . Five Republican Senators , each the sponsor of a bonus bill , said today that they did not intend to let the Democrats run away with the issue . The Republicans announced their joint sponsorship of a new ; bonus proposal to be financed by increasing the tax on ciga1rettes from 5 cents to 6 . The extra penny tax would expire when the necessary $100,000,000 bond issue had been paid off . On Tuesday , the Democratic minorities in both houses will attempt to force from commit tee their proposals for a Korean lbonus with no provision for financing . Proposed Bonus Rates The bonus under discussion would pay $250 to Korean veterans with overseas service , $150 to those who served more than sixty days In the United States , and $50 to those with less than sixty days of service . It would require a constitutional amendment passed by two legislative sessions and approved by the voters in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedure were started now . No motion to bring a bill to the floor against a committees wishes has prevailed since 1907 . But by forcing the Republicans to uphold the committee and keep the bonus issue from direct debate , the Democrats could , cause considerable political embarrassment for Governor Rockefeller . Governor to Face Legion The reason for this is that , on Tuesday evening Mr. Rockefeller is to address the annual legislative dinner of the state American Legion , which is solidly behind the bonus campaign and hostile to those resisting it . Whether this combination of circumstances will divide the quiet entente against a bonus that has been arranged by the Governor and the Republican legislative leaders is the critical question . It could certainly strain such an understanding severely . A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Walter J. Mahoney said the action by Republican Senators should not be taken as an indication that // Mr. Mahoney favored bonus legislation now . When the Senators . approached him , he told them that no proposal that did not include taxes to finance the bonus would have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutional amendment through the Rules Committee , of which he is chairman , without any personal commitment . Speaker Joseph F. Carlino of the Assembly said he would take no position on the issue until it had been discussed more thoroughly . At a news conference last week , Governor Rockefeller held that it was up to the Legislature to decide whether a bonus should be enacted . He said he did not plan to play any role in that decision . Veterans ' Groups Meet Representatives of nine veterans ' organizations met in the Sheraton . Ten Eyck Hotel this afternoon to plan a strenuous campaign in support of bonus legislation . A spokesman declined to say whether they would support a proposal with a tax attached . The veterans formally endorsed a resolution now before the Legislature to set up a special committee to study the bonus situation and report by March 1 .

Mr. Rockefeller , who signed the original bill , now feels the law should be changed . Report Due Tuesday The Assembly Committee on Ethics and Guidance , which has been investigating conflict of interest charges against Speaker Carlino , expects to hand up its report on Tuesday . Assemblyman Mark Lane , Democrat of Manhattan , brought the charges because Mr. Carlino was a director of a home fall-out shelter manufacturing concern when he helped to push a school-shelter bill through the Legislature last November .
