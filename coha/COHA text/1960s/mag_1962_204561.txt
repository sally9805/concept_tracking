On both sides of the Atlantic last week , men paid homage to a renaissance . <P> " The nations of Western Europe , " said President Kennedy on the Fourth of July in Philadelphia , " long divided by feuds far more bitter than any which existed among the 13 colonies , are today joining together , seeking as our forefathers sought , to find freedom in diversity and unity from strength . " Echoing Europe 's own Jean Monnet , Kennedy called for a " concrete Atlantic partnership " that would help " achieve a world of law and free choice . " He looked forward to a " declaration of interdependence . . . between the new union now emerging in Europe and the old American union founded here 175 years ago .
