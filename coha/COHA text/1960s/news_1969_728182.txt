txt The Soviets may believe  --  as party secretary Leonid I. Brezhnev has just said  --  that they and their fellow hard-liners in Prague are now " talking the same language . " But important West European Communist parties are not . Instead , they continue to make clear that in the matter of Czechoslovakia , their disagreements with Moscow remain unchanged . Foremost among these is the big and important Italian party . Others are the British Communist ' Party , facing a crucial party congress on the invasion issue later this month , the Swiss and , though more cautiously , the Belgian party . All these have indicated that , unlike the French and Finnish parties , they decline to regard events in Czechoslovakia since last year as a closed episode which the Russians and the international movement can now shrug off and complacently sweep under the rug . Continued opposition to the Soviet intervention has been explicitly reaffirmed by these parties as a matter of vital " principle . " There are other small parties which , though adopting a careful centrist position for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " are still deeply disturbed by the invasion issue and their rank-and-file split . Austrian stand firm There are many individual eminent West European Communists , whose parties have elected to come to terms with the Soviets , who continue to speak out against their leaderships ' official positions . Roger Garaudy , one of the French party 's leading philosophers , in a recent interview forthrightly accused the  --  Soviets of ignoring the essential problems raised by the Czechoslovak reform movement . He ridiculed Moscow 's pretext for intervention against " a handful of counterrevolutionary elements " allegedly inspired by Western propaganda . Ernst Fischer , the veteran theoretician recently expelled from the Austrian party because he still rejects the shift of line adopted ( under Soviet pressure ) at its congress last January , continues to " champion outside the party what is no longer possible within it . " Like many other Western Communists , he hoped the Czech reform movement would establish a positive example for Western Communist parties which were still governed by their Stalinist past . Soviet intervention in Prague , Mr. Fischer said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " a lack of understanding " of the historical background of other Communist nations and parties . The Soviet Union , he declared , had no " inherited right of infallibility " because it happened to be the first Communist country . // *Reds still split over Czechs // ? A number of Western party leaderships still regard the concessions made in Prague -. since the invasion as imposed conditions accepted under duress , and they continue to say so . Some , explicitly or implicitly , rejected outright the September decisions which finally removed Mr. Dubcek and other reform leaders from their remnants of influence in Prague and began the purge which has since swept through lower levels of the party . Italian party chief Luigi Longo issued an unequivocal statement repudiating the Kremlin 's doctrine of " limited sovereignty " ( with which it seeks to justify intervention in any Communist state which steps out of the Soviet mold ) . He firmly upheld the right of all parties to conduct their own internal policies without interference or pressures from outside . The British party  --  numerically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence among Western Communists ? took a firm stand against the invasion from the start and has maintained it . Intervention ' deplored ' After the Czech riots which marked the August anniversary and the repressive measures adopted by the Prague regime in reply , the party executive reaffirmed its antiinvasion stand . It also disclosed its intention to seek endorsement at the party congress opening in London Nov. 15 . The official agenda contains a resolution " deploring the intervention of the Warsaw Pact powers in Czechoslovakia . " Military intervention , an executive spokesman said , had not resolved the problems raised by developments in Czechoslovakia . " That an extremely difficult situation still exists , more than a year after the troops entry , " he said , " is demonstrated by the decision to introduce stringent laws which could affect civil liberties . " A stiff fight with strong and increasingly belligerent pro-Soviet minority within the British party is certain at the closing congress . Preparatory regional conferences have taken place behind closed doors and little has leaked out to indicate which way things might go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Belgian party 's Politburo last month . It was guardedly worded . But it said that its initial disapproval of the invasion  --  calling , inter alia , for the withdrawal of Soviet troops ? " has not changed . " Apart from dissatisfied Western parties , the Russians still have to contend with critics within the ruling Communist bloc . Both Yugoslav and Romanian condemnation of the invasion has been muted for the sake of better relations with Moscow . But , challenged outright , neither leadership would  --  or could afford to  --  disagree with the position expressed by the British party newspaper . Morning Star roundly said that the views of " a particular leadership " ( meaning , of course , the Sovie , t ) could not determine other parties ' attitudes , " especially where questions of principle involving relations between Communist parties and socialist states are involved . " The specific case of Czechoslovakia may , with time , fade into the background . But for the Soviets the issue of relations within the international movement as a whole is still as acute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paper " unity " devised at the June conference .
