Black Mischief by James Ridgeway A group of black nationalists in Washington want to create a mercenary army of American Negroes to fight for the independence of central and southern Africa . By doing so , they hope to win a nation for themselves . The leader is self-styled Colonel Hassan JeruAhmed , a 42-year-old Washington Negro who as Albert Roy Osborne once sold wigs . His organization is called the Blackman 's Volunteer Army of Liberation . I first heard about the army when a friend sent me its militant " Declaration of Purpose " along with a message that had been put out to African embassies and UN missions . It said : " From the late Honorable Marcus Garvey to the martyred Malcolm X , Blackmen have directed their minds and hearts toward Africa , seeking relief from murder and an enslaved citizenship . In every instance our efforts have been stopped by white-men . Whitemen who were , and are , interested only in retaining the slave labor of Blackmen and the plundering of our Motherland Africa . 1966 begins the final death throes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blackmen of the earth , are all free and have returned to the land and people of our ancestry . . . . Throughout America there are millions of Blackmen and Blackwomen who desire to live the remainder of their lives , and to insure freedom for their children , within the Continent of Africa . There are thousands of these Black People that have dedicated their minds and efforts toward the future and are secretly and feverishly working to make this dream a reality . Searching out , and finding , the Blackmen and Blackwomen who understand that the only solution to their dangerously lived existence is to earn with their minds , bodies and blood , a land that can truly be called their nation . " We will send to Africa to work and to fight and to build Black surgeons , physicians , nurses , dentists , teachers , and instructors , engineers and technicians and skilled women of every capacity , along with a volunteer army of the best-trained and hardiest Military Blackmen of the earth . " Back-to-Africa movements have not come to anything in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " army " and made arrangements to have an interview with Hassan . The headquarters of the Black Star Regiment , the " army 's " one unit , is located in a clutch of rooms over a wig store at c ) to Kennedy Street , N.W. , in a lower-middle-class Negro district . The ' ground floor door waslocked and the window covered over with red and green paper . A sign said Blackman 's Development Center . I rang the bell , and was asked over an intercom to identify myself . A buzzer unlocked the door , and going up a flight of stairs , I was greeted by Major Simba . He was dressed in olive green shirt and black trousers set off by an impressive lot of brass . Out of doors the volunteers wear blue berets . Simba ushered me into the reception room . On one wall was a photograph of Malcolm X , on another a big map of the United States with threads running from a pin stuck in Washington to other pins stuck in other cities . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a standard bearing the " army 's " flag ? red , black and green horizontal stripes . The flag was adopted from the Garveyite movement . Red is for blood , black for the color of the skin , and green for the land . A girl in African dress called Colonel Hassan over the intercom , and soon he appeared , a tall , slender man . Exchanging salutes with Major Simba , Hassan led me to his office in the front of the building . The blinds were tightly drawn , and Hassan gravely assured me guards were hidden across the street and behind the building , watching people who rang the buzzer down below . Hassan said he was sure people from the State Department , CIA , FBI , various white African governments , as well as various black African governments , were trying to find out about his " army , " and he could not afford to take any chances . The only hope for Negroes in America , Hassan said , was to quit the country and join their brothers and sisters in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tyranny , American Negroes could win citizenship in a new Africa . Unlike other black nationalists who have culturally and emotionally linked themselves with Africa , Hassan intends to take people back there , to get land . Hassan said he had swung over to nationalism in prison , where he was sent for passing had checks and where he met Muslims . Recently he has been negotiating with a number of African countries , which he refused to name . These dealings apparently hold some promise , for he claims to be taking five men and going to Africa the first of the year to carry forward negotiations . On his return from Africa , Hassan said , he would bring into the open 31 branch offices around the country and set going a training camp in Westmoreland County , Virginia . He says he has 34 acres there . His " army , " he says , will help young Negroes avoid the draft if need he ( Vietnam , he believes , is a senseless white man 's war ) . Volunteers will go to weekly meetings at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history and Swahili , and become judo experts . Then they 'll get their passports , and go to an independent African nation , and from there into the resistance in places like Angola , South Rhodesia and South Africa . ( He told me transportation to Africa has been promised by a country he would not name . ) The " army " also will collect needed supplies for African resistance movements . It wants to register with Congress as a lobby to push for a repatriation bill to give incentives to Negroes wanting to live in Africa . As he talked , Hassan referred several times to the " international Jewish communist conspiracy . " He believes the Jews have a death grip on the Negro ghetto economy and are milking it to support Israel . I asked Hassan where he got the idea of international Jewish communist conspiracy . Hassan said he first began to be suspicious when he was a youngster working in a whisky store owned by two Jews . They tried to lure him into joining the Communist Party , he said . He successfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere by other Jews . Hassan was not sure who directs the " conspiracy . " " The world is entering an era of positive racism , " Hassan thinks . " The races must first be separated ; countries must be nationalized ; then you 'll have a little peace in the world . " In addition to the support he hopes to get from African countries , Hassan is anxious to get money from the various groups who want Negroes to leave America . The colonel said he had received a heartening telephone call from George Lincoln Rockwell , who told him he was on the right track , and he had received overtures from the Liberty Lobby . There had been calls from the Ku Klux Klan and the Manion Forum . Hassan said he was also interested in making contact with representatives of the international Jewish communist conspiracy , but thus far this had n't panned out . When I talked with him , Hassan was trying to raise the money to pay a $500 telephone bill , as well as stave off eviction from his home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a little cash to support the army by selling wigs or running a termite extermination service . But negotiations with the Africans were hot and heavy . and left him no time for other matters . The colonel said he was born in Washington , had never known his father , and went from high school to jail for yoke robbery . He was drafted at the start of the Second World War and served in the Air Force , both in Europe and later in the Pacific . The army impressed him , and while he was on duty in the Far East hefudged his orders so he could visit North Africa . He was much taken with the openness of the people , who gave him the name of Hassan , meaning handsome . After the war he ran a delicatessen in Washington for a while , but this ended with Hassan landing in prison again for passing bad checks . He was in and out of jail a couple more times for had checks . He was successful periodically in operating valet shops , used car lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always squeezed by creditors leaving Hassan with more bad checks . After one check-passing binge , Hassan was locked up for five years . While he was in prison his wife was murdered . On getting out , he remarried and became successful in the wig business , where he was known as " Mr. Tony . " That was in 1962 , when a wig craze hit Negro sections of Washington . In five months Hassan sold 7,000 wigs made from yak hair , and made $1430 clear on each one . Sickening of this business , Hassan pulled up stakes one evening and taking his wife and children drove to Los Angeles . There was n't much of a future there , and pressed to make a living , he reverted to the wig hustle and became a wholesaler traveling up and down the coast . Hassan met Muslims in prison who made a strong impression on him and filled with bitterness toward the white merchants he always ended up working for , he turned toward nationalism . And on his trips up and down the coast he planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of Hassan 's wig enterprises was burned out in the Watts riot . Drilling in the Backyard I visiLed Hassan a couple of times more , hoping he would take me to a meeting of his Washington units . But the meetings kept being postponed . I never saw more than three men in the office , always in impeccable uniform . They were attended by two girls who served coffee . The men were bent over plans or charts or departing on mysterious missions . There are rumors of people seeing men in close order drill in the headquarters backyard . Officials in the State Department had not heard of the " army " ; knowledgeable African diplomats dismissed it out of hand ; contacts in Harlem knew nothing . To whites and many Negroes , Hassan 's " army " will seem a nightmare ; and it probably wo n't ever amount to much . But Hassan 's life - running from one hustle to another ? is repeated a thousand times over in the ghettoes by black men who ca n't make it in a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an escape in fantasy . On one occasion while I was talking with Hassan , a mysterious unnamed African dropped in . He sounded out the colonel on the strength of the organization , and Hassan promised he could muster 5,000 followers . The African did n't seem to care about the " army " and had only a passing interest in Hassan 's desires for a country . But he was eager to recruit black technicians , mechanics , educators , as many as possible . But , he warned , the wages were low , living conditions in the bush poor , and he was having a hard time figuring out why American Negroes would want to go to Africa . Unless , perhaps , the " army " was filled with agents for some white government . He asked Hassan if the men could be trusted , and when Hassan assured him they could the African changed the subject , joked around a bit , said Africa was a wonderful place , then told a cheery story about a man who had turned out to he traitor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a izth floor window , then dropped head first on the cement pavement below . " Squish , " said Hassan appreciatively.
