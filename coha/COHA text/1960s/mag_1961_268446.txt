Strolling down 48th Street in Manhattan one afternoon last week , a visiting Frenchwoman felt a light tap on her arm . " Lady , " said a frowzy , spiritless panhandler , " c'n ya lemmee have a quarter to buy my little boy some milk ? " As the woman reached into her purse , the city 's street sounds suddenly receded , and she heard the blare of a rock-'n ' - roll tune . She glanced around , at length found the source of the music : the panhandler was carrying a small transistor radio . The Frenchwoman snapped shut her purse and marched on . <P> All over the U.S. , a new order of restless American stalks city and countryside carrying tiny transistors . He ca n't stand silence . With his gadget turned up full-blast , the bleatnik goes about his pursuits with ear and mind cocked to sportscasts , disk-jockeywockey and what passes for pop music . He plods along , swinging his radio like an attach case , or stuffs it into his shirt pocket , while the unrelenting blabber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an earpiece receiver , identification may be more difficult , but there are certain telltale signs , as there are of hopheads and alcoholics : a faraway look of rapture , or just a plain , vacant stare . <P> In a Manhole . The increase of people hooked on sound matches the steep curve of radio sales . Buyers snatched up a few thousand portable transistor sets when they first hit the market in late 1954 ; last year , including Japanese-made sets that brought the prices down to well under $10 , unit sales rose to a record 8,500,000 . Like other addicts , the bleatniks are ingenious in their devotion to their pastime . They attend baseball games , trusty radio in hand , and tune in on the sportscaster to be certain that the announcer sees what the bleacherite sees ; sometimes the fan tunes in a second ball game and , by concentrating hard , follows both at once , even if no one else can . With his built-in portable background music , a lonely boy can entice and entertain a girl without need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still the transistor for company . <P> Near Milk Street in Boston , a fruit peddler keeps his little radio nestled among the purple plums , and startled passers-by always pause to stare at the singing fruit . Small boys on bicycles churn along the roads with radios topped with long whip antennas ( they used to carry fishing rods ) . On a downtown Dallas street recently , pedestrians arched their brows at an open manhole from which floated the ball-game scores . Chinese listeners in San Francisco may soon-if the electronic wrinkles are ironed out-watch the video version of Gunsmoke while their radios blast out a Cantonese translation , courtesy of a local radio station . " Grab a hunk of sky , " mouths Marshal Matt Dillon from the TV screen . " Ghur sao chiu tin " rasps radio 's Cantonese cowpoke . <P> At the Hollywood Bowl , while the symphony orchestra plays live , a man watches transfixed as he listens to the fights over his earpieces . In drive-in movies , canny audiences follow the picture and their favorite disk jockey simultaneously , presumably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
