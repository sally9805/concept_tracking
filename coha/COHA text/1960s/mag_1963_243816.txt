To run England 's Eton is to tutor England 's Establishment , which is to say that a man had better respect the customs . Headmaster Robert Birley , who took over in 1949 , seemed at times a bit rebellious . To the shock of Pop , the school club with old boys in high places , Birley opened Eton 's doors to a few lads from the lower classes . Last year , when Birley was passed over for a knighthood , the London Sunday Telegraph blamed the " Pop lobby . " This summer Birley will quit with a year yet to go on the usual 15-year tenure . <P> Last week Eton named his successor : <P> Anthony Chenevix-Trench. 43 , an out-of-tradition choice since he did not go to Eton or even teach there .

He plans no changes : " It is a wise chap who waits and sees . " He is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the servants of older boys . As for another old custom , the right of head boys to beat others , he says : " If I were going to a school that did n't have it , I would n't start it . But if a school has it-well , it 's useful .
