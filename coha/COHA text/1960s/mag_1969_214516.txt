Bus passengers in Atlanta have been staring at some unusual posters in recent weeks . " They fixed my porch , but then they took my house ! " one proclaims . " I 'd rather walk clean across town than pay 45 for a bunch of greens ! " advertises another . <P> Part of a publicity campaign by the city 's Legal Aid Society , the slogans warn the poor-most of them uneducated Negroes-against some common forms of exploitation . They also serve as a warning to the exploiters . Under a Legal Aid Society program , some of the smartest young lawyers in Atlanta 's top firms are taking their Saturdays and other days off to defend the poor . <P> Young lawyers in many cities are representing the poor in their spare time . They handle everything from criminal matters to consumer complaints and even divorces . But Atlanta has one of the most aggressive programs . The Legal Aid Society has 21 regular staffers and 56 volunteer lawyers who spend their weekends hearing complaints in ghetto offices . They are responsible for seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it during the regular work week . Their employers do not seem to mind . In fact , the society 's board of directors is composed mostly of senior lawyers from the volunteers ' firms . <P> Reducing the Bill . The volunteers are doing pioneer work in a comparatively new field of law : the rights of the poor . In an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court , the Legal Aid Society seeks to have the state 's tenant-eviction statute declared unconstitutional because the law makes it all but impossible for the evicted persons to defend themselves in court . Volunteer lawyers are also challenging in a federal court state welfare laws that provide payments for a parent 's first three children but none for any born thereafter . <P> Responding to complaints about high prices and sales of spoiled food , the Saturday lawyers persuaded the owner of a ghetto supermarket to make improvements and to meet regularly with a committee of his customers . Society Director Michael Padnos also arranged to have Grady Hospital , which treats many of the city 's poor , review the financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawsuits to collect the money . <P> The Saturday lawyers try to retaliate against those who take advantage of others ' ignorance to make their own living . In a typical case , an illiterate woman came to Legal Aid because she had been tricked into putting up the deed to her home as security for $700 worth of household repairs . After the repairs were completed , a loan company claimed that with interest and other charges she actually owed $1,900 . When the company threatened to take over her home , Bill Ide , one of the Legal Aid volunteers , promptly filed suit for his client . Charging contractor and loan company with a " fraudulent conspiracy , " Ide asked for $25,000 in punitive damages . The claim against the woman was quickly dropped-and so was Ide 's suit .
