" Tell that to the Colonel , " Brown said . " He can use the advice ! " " Is it true that he called the whole battalion out just to recover some redskin 's rifle ? " Brown laughed . " What 's more , he 's issued an order saying that it will be considered a very gross offense for a soldier to wrong or insult an Indian ! " " Why , in God 's name ? " " He says that this pow-wow in Laramie is a great opportunity ! He 's not going to let anything spoil it ! " " Ah ! " the captain of the garrison intervened . " The only ones who talk that way are the ones who are scared to fight ! " He glanced around , wondering if he had gone too far . He encountered no resistance . He said : " I thought the Eighteenth Infantry was a fighting regiment ! " " So it is ! " Bisbee and Brown cried together . " Then why . . . " The captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " I 'll tell you the fellow who knew how to deal with redskins Chiving-ton ! " The captain nodded . " Finest lesson they ever got was over at Sand Creek ! " " What a thrashing ! " The lieutenant picked up a spoon and placed it upon the table in front of him . " Here , " he explained , " are the lodges of Black Kettle 's band along Sand Creek . " The officers of the Second Battalion contemplated the lodges ; the lieutenant took a table knife and laid it along the table , blade pointing toward the spoon . " Here , " he said , " is Chivington , marching north from Fort Lyon . " He thrust the knife , blade forward , toward the unsuspectingspoon . He gave it a sudden twist . " At sunrise , " he explained , " the first regiment turns to cut off the pony herds . "  |p101His  audience nodded . Seizing another knife , the lieutenantbrought it around the spoon . " Now , " he cried , " Chivington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are sleeping ! " He struck the spoon severalsmart blows with the knife 's sharp edge . " Now watch ! " he cried . Gripping the two knives , he attackedthe spoon as a man attacks a bowl of spaghetti  --  gouging it , tossing it in the air , flipping it over . " Both regiments come together and trap Black Kettle 's band  --  men , women , and children ! " He continued to jab the helpless spoon with both knife ends , inflicting some incidental damage to the tabletop . " Over one hundred scalps , Chivington 's men held up in the theater at Denver , " he cried . " If the redskins had n't dug pits , he would have killed every last one ! " Triumphant , he laid both knives back in their respectivebarracks , leaving the spoon unmoving on the table . Around Fort Laramie there massed in June four hundred tepees of the Cheyennes and the Sioux . Old men squatted in the sunlight , smoking and searching for body lice . Squaws moved among wooden frames where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Children rushed about , playing with puppies and running down stray colts . Babies stared wide-eyed and grave from baskets as their mothers waded splashing across the river and clambered up the bluffs , past the ruins of old Fortp102William and the rotting timbers of Fort John and in between the elegant buildings of new Fort Laramie . There , on the parade ground , a thousand whites milled around : emigrants trading , soldiers drilling , speculators arguing . Three thousand Indians moved among them : chiefs in full headdress ; braves licking peppermint sticks ; laughing girls painted with vermilion and yellow ocher , their black braids ornamented with beads and shells , their pierced ears suspending silver and brass pendants , their shouldersbright with shawls of calico made for tablecloths . Around the sutler 's store the older women gathered , backs bent and skirts looped up to hold loads of rice and sugar . And where the flag hung limp , one stately warrior danced in a cast-off officer 's uniform , slashing the air with his saber and demanding half a dollar while his pigtails bobbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the parade ground stood a fine frame building , the quarters of the commanding officer of Fort Laramie . From its front porch a platform extended , with two tables and seven chairs . Beneath the platform were rows of benches built from planks and shielded from the sun by boughs of pine . Here at midmorning the Indians gathered , the chiefs in the front rows , the subchiefs behind them , the braves in the back benches , and , standing behind them , the women . Silently they waited , watching the windows of the house , where from time to time anxious faces appearedand vanished . At ten fifty the doors opened and Jarrott , the Indian agent , stepped out on the platform . Without looking up , he laid documents on the tables and pads of note paper on each chair . Then he went back inside the house . At ten fifty-five the doors opened again , this time for two stenographers . They took their seats at the tables , dippedp103quills in inkwells , and marked the date , June 13 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened a third time and the commissioners paraded out and took their seats . Edward Taylor , Superintendent of Indian Affairs at Omaha and commission chairman , took the center chair , held for him by Jarrott ; he spread his morning coat on each side of it and crossed his legs . To his left , Wister , the Philadelphia politician , laid his stovepipe hat beneath his chair . To his right , Maynardier and McLaren shifted uneasily in full dress uniform and sabers . Behind them , Edmund Guerrier , the half-breed interpreter , fingeredhis black stock , staring down at the platform through eyes narrow and glazed . More whites and Indiansmoved up behind the benches , and a group of officers , Colonel Otis among them , sauntered over to join the crowd . The commissioners waited ; from the front benches the leaders of the Sioux nation rose and mounted the platform . There they sat cross-legged on blankets : Spotted Tail and Standing Elk of the Brules ; Big Mouth and Man Afraid of the Ogallalas and Hunkpapas ; Red Cloud speaking for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minneconjou and Hunkpatila Sioux . " All there but the Cheyennes , " whispered Bullock , the Laramie sutler , to Otis . " They have gone south with the government 's permission to hunt buffalo . This , " he added , " should be the final day . " Taylor was restless ; he rose to speak , but Maynardier shook his head . In silence , Man Afraid lit his long clay pipe and passed it along . Taylor watched it , and when at last it returned to Man Afraid he rose again . He spoke slowly ; after each sentence he nodded to Guerrier . His black hair falling over his black coat , his black mustache curling over his lips , the half-breed muttered his transla/tion , never raising his eyes from the floor . The chiefs listened without moving and occasionally grunted or belched . Bullock listened closely , chuckling as Guerrier stumbled over a word that had no counterpart in the language of the Sioux . " The Great Father loves his children , " declared Taylor . " He wishes them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . War does no man any good . No one should make war if they can help it . The young braves may kill some whites and steal some horses , but the Great Father will surely send more soldiers . And for the soldiers he must build more forts . That is bad for the Indians  --  it drives the game away . " As Guerrier muttered and motioned , Taylor watched the chiefs . He paused to see if they would assent or disagree . But they sat silent and motionless . Taylor glanced at Maynardier and started again : " Fourteen sleeps ago the great chiefs met with the representatives  --  thespokesmen , that is  --  of the Great Father . They smoked the peace pipe . The chiefs spoke what was in their hearts . We told them the wishes of their Great Father . The Great Father does not want to take away their country . He does not want to buy their country and then not pay , as the chiefs have said , and with truth , he did before . He wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He asks only that his white children may travel through the country of his red children  --  may travel through on one road , to where the yellow dust lies in the mountains . " He paused again , waiting and watching for a long minute after Guerrier had fallen silent . But no chief moved . Taylor looked at Maynardier again and Maynardier nodded . Taylor glanced down at the notes held low andp105close to his side . He said : " Eight sleeps ago the chiefs spoke their hearts and we listened . Spotted Tail spoke , and Red Leaf spoke , and Red Cloud , and The Man Afraid of His Horses spoke . They said that a road might be made to the mountains if the game was left alone . They said they might sign the treaty the Great Father desires . They asked for time to bring in their people who were camped at the head of the White River . Now they have returned with their people . Today the Great Father hopes that the treaty will be agreed upon and peace made . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed his knees , and looked across at the chiefs . But the chiefs stared back , unmoved . They waited , and Wister leaned over to whisper . Taylor nodded and motioned to the senior clerk . The clerk stood up and read , in a high and monotonous voice , Article One of the proposed treaty : " The Brule and Ogallala Bands of Dakota and Sioux Indians represented in council hereby acknowledge themselves to be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States and hereby obligate and bind themselvesindividually and collectively not only to cease all hostilities against the persons and property of its citizens to live hereafter in peace and amity but to use their influence in inducing other neighboring tribes to maintain peaceful relations with each other and the United States . ' " All this the clerk read without stopping for breath , while Guerrier listened impassively . He muttered a translation , and it was brief because he could not understand , let alone translate , most of the words . Then he nodded , and the clerk rattled off the second Article , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he licked his mustache and muttered a sentence or two . The clerk read the third Article :  | " The said bands shall withdraw from the routes overlandalready established or hereafter to be established through their country and in consideration thereof the government of the United States agrees to pay to the said bands the sum of $70,000 annually for twenty years , the same to be apportioned among the bands party to this treaty . ' " This last aroused Guerrier 's attention . He repeated it slowly , with many gestures . With still greater emphasis he translated the last Article , which outlined the presents to be distributed after the signing of the treaty . The chiefs listened , nodding , and when he finished there was much grunting among the Indians seated along the benches . The commissioners waited , and Wister shuffled his notes , evidently in the belief that if no one else would speak , he must . But the oldest among the chiefs , White Forehead , raised himself painfully and wrapped his blanket tightly around his gaunt frame . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear . But the Indians around him heard and muttered . And Guerrier listened , looking up from the floor only when the old man had finished . Then Guerrier translated while White Forehead stood , still nodding like a pendulum that , once started , found motion simpler than rest . " I have but one heart , " Guerrier said . " I speak with but one tongue . I want our father to take pity on us . He is rich . We are poor . Let him give us a thousand horses and a thousand mules , and he can pass freely to the yellow dust that is neither food nor drink . He can take one half the land we have left . " Shaking his head , Taylor rose . " The Great Father does not want to take your land or to buy your land , " he explained . " He wants peace and the road ; no more . "  |p107The  old chief stood , swaying and nodding . When Guerrierfinished , he spoke again . " We are poor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us the horses , only the horses and fifty wagons , and you shall have one half our land . " Taylor turned , sighing , to Maynardier . " Have patience , " Maynardier murmured . Lacking patience , Wister leaned forward shaking a finger at White Forehead , who stood swaying , eyes closed , as if in a trance . He cried : " You say we are rich and you are poor ! If you wish to be rich , then you must work as we do ! Among the white men no one is rich unless he works ! No bread falls from the sky . " Guerrier shrugged his shoulders and translated withoutfeeling . White Forehead swayed and nodded as Guerrier gestured , then spoke again in his low , far-off voice . " My father speaks to me , " Guerrier repeated . " He uses strong words . He wishes me to be like him . My father 's children were born in soft places . I was born on the prairie . My father 's children all have sense . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised in the dirt . We have lived all our lives by hunting the buffalo . The Great Spirit gave us the buffalo . The white hunter took the buffalo away . We were rich when the game lived around us . Now we are poor . But the white man is rich . Have pity on us . Give us a thousand horses , only a thousand horses , not even the wagons  --  and you may take half the land . " Wister looked hard at Taylor , meaning : How long must we listen to this old fellow ? Taylor looked at Maynardier , who shook his head . Taylor repeated himself : " I have said many times : the Great Father does not want the land . He wants his Indian children to live on the land , to work the land . "  |p108White  Forehead rocked back and forth with eyes closed as if he were seeing the plains of his youth , when he slew buffalo without number and returned with fifty ponies from raiding parties against his enemies the Crows . " Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " I do not know how to work the land . I am too old , too old to learn . I have been a hunter and a warrior since my youth . I will die a hunter and warrior . I can not be what I am not . " Wister tried again to speak , but Taylor motioned : wait . He said : " The Great Father will help you plant the earth . He will send tools and someone to teach you . I know you do not know much about planting . But you will never learn unless you begin . First you plant ; then you hunt the buffalo . While you are hunting , your corn is growing . Then when winter comes you will have both buffalo and corn . You will be richer and better fed . " Guerrier translated without enthusiasm . Around Otis and Bullock the Indians shifted on their benches and shook their heads . White Forehead raised his hands in a gesture of hopelessness , spoke a few words , and sank down upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn . I will die as I am , with my people . But I have been thinking much . I have thought : perhaps my children may learn . " Taylor smiled . He was pleased . " The Great Father is pleased by the words of White Forehead , " he said . But the Indians around Otis were not pleased . They muttered loudly among themselves , and Otis looked at Bullock . " They say they are hunters , not workers of the dirt , " Bullock whispered . " They say they are Sioux , not Pawnee dogs . " An Indian chief , Spotted Tail , was aware of the unrest among his people . He rose , a powerful young leader.  | " I also am a hunter and a warrior , " Guerrier translated . " I remember the buffalo as White Forehead , and I remember the bones of my brothers whitening along the blue water , and the Cheyenne . I do not know what it means to work the land . But I trust my brother Maynardier . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , and we did not go hungry . He kept his promises . If he believesit is best for us to allow the road , if he tells us now the road will not make trouble , then I will sign the treaty that the Great Father desires . " Bullock whispered to Otis : " Spotted Tail is a wise leader . He knows the Sioux are not yet ready to think of farming . And he knows that Red Cloud is prepared to seize leadership on a platform of resistance . He wishes to cross the river ahead . " Maynardier evidently held the same view . He motioned to Taylor to rise at once and press the treaty . But before Taylor could speak , a young brave close by Red Cloud stepped forward . He spoke out of turn , in a voice harsh and shrill . He did not wait for Guerrier to translate . The Indians on the benches stirred uneasily as he spoke ; the commissioners looked anxiously at each other . Guerrier listened , breathing hard through nostrils wide apart . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tall one , meaning Mr. Taylor . He says : Who is the Great Father the tall one speaks of all the time ? He listens only to his great father in the skies . He says if the tall one wants to do good , then he should give up the road . The road is the only difficulty . If the tall one wants peace , then he must give up the road . " Protesting , Taylor rose , but before he could answer , the Lancer thrust forward again . He shrilled a few words , wheeled , and sat down at his place . The Indians on the benches laughed and grunted , and Guerrier turned darkp110and looked away . The commissioners called upon him to translate . " The Lancer , " Guerrier muttered , " the Lancer says how can the Great Father of the tall one make peace betweenthe white man and the Indian when he can not even keep peace between his own white children ? " " Not bad ! " whispered Bullock , and McLaren jumped up crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braves had stepped from behind Red Cloud . Tossing their blankets over their shoulders , they stood beforeTaylor . " The Minneconjou , " Bullock whispered . " They say , the Great Spirit in the skies gave the land north of the Platte to the Sioux . If the white men want peace , they must keep out of the land north of the Platte . " At this , all the chiefs rose , bold and intransigent ; the Indians stood up on the benches . Otis and Bullock moved forward , but a black-robed figure swept past them , up and onto the platform . In his presence the Minneconjou retreated and sat cowed in their places ; the chiefs subsided ; the crowd fell silent . He turned , a plump priest with a woman 's black hair and a baby 's simple face . He looked down upon the crowd and suddenly stretched out black-cloaked arms as if to cover them all . His small mouth and white hands formed the language of the Sioux , and they listened , awed . " Father de Smet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son the Lancer saddens me . My children the Minneconjousadden me . They speak of the Great Spirit in the sky , but they depart from the ways of the Great Spirit . They threaten war . The Great Spirit wants peace between his white and Indian children . ' He says he will pray , and after he prays , there must be no more threatening. . . . 111The priest closed his eyes , bent his head , and intoned in Latin : " 0 my God . . . we humbly beseech Thee . . . to forgive us in Thy mercy . . . for having offendedThee . " The Indians imitated the priest , bending their heads and grunting , although some of them peered out and around . Bullock and Otis stared at the earth at their feet ; when they looked up , the Jesuit was gone . Taylor looked left and right to see who among the commissionerswould speak . None moved , and among the Indiansa tall chief rose , erect and marvelously dressed . He spoke slowly and evenly , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look . The half-breed fingered his black tie and translated carefully , hesitating over each word . " Red Cloud says the Black Gown is right . When the white people went to the big war , the Indians took what they needed . Now the big war of the whites is over . The whites are increasing many times . Red Cloud says his women are hungry , his children are naked . When he looks at them , his eyes fill with tears . He says he wants peace . But he does not want to tell his people lies . Once his people were promised something good . He looked for it , but it did not come . He says the white people deceived the chiefs . They made fools of them . He says the whites must give them food  --  food and powder to hunt the buffalo . Then , if they send no more soldiers , they can have the road . " " No more soldiers ! " whispered Otis . " I thought  --  " " Shh , " hissed Bullock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own braves . It must have been a worse winter even than we knew . " " But the Eighteenth . . . " Otis began . He halted , for Taylor had risen . Smiling , the superintendent grasped Red Cloud 's hand.  | " The Great Father is pleased by the wise words of his son the great chief . He will be generous . This time he will not break his word . " Red Cloud nodded and turned to the Ogallala . From among them a weather-beaten figure rose , an older chief whose heavy necklace of grizzly-bear claws proclaimed him a brave man , for all his ragged dress . Bullock leaned close to Otis and murmured : " Man Afraid . " " He looks like the worst of them , " Otis whispered . " The worst ? When Grattan went out of his way to provoke the Sioux , it was Man Afraid who risked his life to prevent war . " " Then why  --  " " Grattan betrayed him , " Bullock whispered , " and he has not forgotten . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Man Afraid was saying . The older chief finished and nodded to Guerrier . " Red Cloud , " Guerrier translated , " has spoken well . I have talked war  --  from this day I will talk peace . " Taylor bowed , smiling . Looking past him , Otis saw Maynardier 's chest heave and sink in a long-drawn sigh of relief . Man Afraid spoke on : " I am a chief . I have been through all the nations . I have smoked all the pipes . When men do not smoke , I think they lie . I do not lie . I come to trade . When I trade , I do not want useless things . I trade for powder . " The commissioners looked at each other . Taylor seemed apologetic . " There is little powder to spare , " he said . Man Afraid smiled as Guerrier translated  --  the pained smile of one who faces a camera into the sun . He made a mocking gesture . The crowd laughed and grunted . " It must be a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Great Father fears to spare a little to his Indian children . " " That is the signal , " whispered Bullock . " The big issue of the treaty is settled ; the bargaining is about to begin . " Losing interest , he turned away from the platform . Otis also turned . He stared out over the crowds , thinking of nothing until he saw , far off , two riders advancing onto the parade ground with the bearing of conquerors ; two infantry officers in full dress uniform ; Phisterer and Carrington . Otis walked toward them , and , seeing him , Carrington spurred his horse . Through the clusters of half-breeds and traders the Kentucky thoroughbred came pirouetting , tossing its head . " The Platte was kind to you after all , " Otis said , holding the elaborate Spanish bridle as Carrington dismounted . Phisterer protested : " If the devil himself had confrontedus in the river , he could have made the crossing no worse ! " " The river fell by a foot at the moment the barge touched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself could not have halted us . " He stepped forward , asking : " Where is the meeting ? " Otis tipped his head back toward the platform . " Taylor expects you , " he said . " He may present you to the chiefs if all goes well . " " They have been told that I am coming ? " " That I do not know . " Carrington was dusting off his uniform and checking the angle of his saber . " I shall sit with the commission , " he said , " while Frederick here arranges for the transfer of the ammunition and supplies that are owed us . " " I trust you get them , " Otis said . " I doubt you will . " Carrington was straining to see the platform over thep114heads of the Indians around them . " A large crowd , " he remarked , " and evidently many chiefs . " " Including Red Cloud , " Otis said . " In fact , it was Red Cloud who rebuked the hotheads this morning . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think so . I think that by this evening only the signing and distribution of presents will remain . " They were approaching the rim of the crowd , and Carrington lowered his voice . " Otis , I have wanted to tell you how fine I thought Maynardier 's dispatches were . And how I have regretted my first reaction at the time you handed them to me . . . . Otis nodded . " Spotted Tail is speaking , " he said . He motioned to Bullock to move up beside them . " He is berating his brother-in-law Man Afraid , " Bullock whispered . " He says there is a time for signing and a time for trading  --  that peace comes before the presents and the gunpowder . He calls on Man Afraid to trust Maynardieras he does  --  to take his word . " Carrington was staring at Taylor ; the superintendent acknowledged his presence with an almost imperceptible nod . As Guerrier translated , Taylor crooked one forefinger and scratched the air , beckoning . Proudly Carrington advanced between the benches and up onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some hesitation , followed . With one hand on Carrington 's shoulder , Taylor led him around . " My good friend Colonel Carrington , sent by the Great Father , will guard the peace . The Great Father . . . " Gravely and gracefully Carrington moved from chief to chief . He looked up from the chest and into the face of Tall Mandan ; he returned the toothless smile of Big Mouth ; he grasped the arm of Spotted Tail , saying : " Myp115heart goes out to you " ; so he came to Red Cloud . The prow of the chief 's nose jutted out from a wide forehead ; his eyes , dark and wide-set , never shifted from Carrington 's . A vest made of the leg bones of thirty eagles rose and sank on his chest as he breathed , and from his black and braided hair a single black-tipped eagle 's feather pointed upward . Carrington gripped his rough hand , seeing Lincoln 's features in the chief 's fine head . Well pleased with Carrington 's manner , Taylor returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for him . At his side Maynardier leaned close to ask how long the Eighteenth would stay on at Laramie . " I have telegraphed Cooke . . . " Carrington began . He leaned closer to whisper : " I have telegraphed Cooke for permission to stay on until the treaty is signed . It seemed to me more tactful , and , besides . . . He halted for a moment as Maynardier 's head twisted toward the end of the platform where the chiefs had gathered and were muttering in low tones . Carrington was a little irritated by Maynardier 's inattention. . . and , besides , I want to speak to all the chiefs . We will do better if we understand each other fully before I march north . " Maynardier nodded , watching the chiefs . " I am holding the regiment five miles downriver , " Carringtoncontinued , " so that there can be no possibility of any unfortunate incident while the negotiations . . . " Maynardier held up his hand in warning . He was watching something off to his left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grouped around Red Cloud and Man Afraid . They had risen and were moving to the center of the platform . And their manner made him uneasy . Taylor also was uneasy . He rose quickly to confrontp116the Indians , motioning Guerrier to join him . Hesitantly the half-breed sidled up behind him , listening as the chiefs spoke and shaking his head . " They speak of the White Eagle , " Guerrier said , tilting his head toward Carrington . " They wish to know if he comes alone . " " Alone ! " cried Taylor . " He comes with many hundred soldiers ! " Guerrier breathed deeply and seemed reluctant to speak at all . Taylor turned to him , and he muttered a few words so low that they might have gone unheard . But the chiefs were listening , and after a moment of silence they spoke together and angrily . From among them Man Afraid stepped forward . Guerrier bent from him , cowed by his words : " Man Afraid says will the White Eagle come and go , or will he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White Eagle stays , will he build forts ? " Taylor was shaken . He turned to Maynardier for help . Maynardier , half rising , said : " Tell Man Afraid that the White Eagle will stay . He must stay to protect the road . And where he stays he must build forts for his soldiers . The White Eagle will build forts along the road . " The Indians watched Maynardier , and when he had finished and sat back , they turned upon Guerrier . The half-breed looked at Maynardier as if the Colonel had ordered him to march without arms or provisions through a hundred hostile camps . He spoke in a voice that could barely be heard , and , brushing past him , Man Afraid stood before Taylor proud and defiant . His voice never rose ; only the hard and hissing tones betrayed his anger . But Guerrier trembled as the chief spoke and , in fear or frenzy , shouted his translation in high-pitched cries . " I have eyes and can see ! I have ears and can hear ! Ip117heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see the White Eagle , and I know that all I heard before was lies ! Taylor lies and Maynardier lies and Pegaleshka lies when he says we can trust them ! We trust no white ! " Guerrier halted , breathing hard through his flat nose , and then Man Afraid was speaking again , and the braves behind him were muttering louder and louder , and after a moment Guerrier was shouting the loudest of all : " Man Afraid says : I have been driven from one gulch to another . ' He says : I have been hunted and wounded ! I have never seen the Great Father 's hand given in mercy . ' He says : I will not see him take now the land the Great Spirit gave to the Sioux . ' Man Afraid says : Our bones whiten in the sun . Our lands are wherever our dead lie ! And the road shall not pass there ! The White Eagle shall not build his forts in our land ! ' " Taylor had sat down , passing his hand across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose , fighting back . " It was understood ! It was taken for granted ! If the road is to be used , the road must be protected ! Man Afraid will agree , and Red Cloud will agree , that even they can not control some of the young braves who rob and kill ! Red Cloud will agree ! " But Red Cloud moved past Man Afraid and stood beforeTaylor . His arms were folded until he spoke , and then his voice and gestures were measured : " We gave you the buffalo land and the shallow river . We drew our people back to protect you . You promised to save our hunting grounds to the north . But you send the soldiers in . You destroy the game . You lied to us . And now you will get nothing from us but war ! " Taylor started to protest , but Red Cloud strode past him and came before Carrington . He stood erect , and as he spoke , sweeping the air with this left hand , Carringtonp118noted in numbness that his right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You are the White Eagle who comes to steal the road , " Guerrier repeated as if he , too , were Carrington 's enemy . " The Great Father sends us presents and asks us to sell the road . You come with your soldiers to steal the road before the Indians can say yes or no . " Red Cloud turned and swept an arm across the crowd , and pointed to the north . " I and my people will go now . " He came close , for the last time , to Carrington . " And we will fight you ! As long as I live , we will fight you for our last hunting ground ! Every milestone you move forwardwill mark a gravestone for your soldiers ! And in five moons you will have not one hoof left ! " He strode from the platform as Guerrier spoke , and all but Spotted Tail left with him . Still gesturing , he passed through the benches , and from both sides many Indians rose and followed him . Guerrier stepped to the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned , treading on the blanket where Spotted Tail crouched with bent head ; he licked his mustache . " Red Cloud swears to the others : he will kill every white , men , women , and children , that crosses the Crazy Woman'sFork of the Powder River . " The commissioners stood watching as the crowd and its new leader passed out of sight . At last Taylor said : " He will get no presents . . . . " He wants none , " Maynardier said . The commissioners moved about in a distracted manner . Carrington , standing among them , heard dimly their disjointed phrases : " Did he really believe there was never any question , was there ? " " . . . if ColonelCarrington had only waited ! " " . . . nothing else we could have done . " " . . . still sign the treaty . " " I 'll go backp119with a treaty "  --  Taylor 's voice  --  " if there are only two Indians left who will sign it . " " Not your responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was bound to happen , " Otis said . And another officer : " They never intendedpeace . . . . " And Phisterer : " I bring bad news , Colonel . . . . " The phrases came like travelers across a desert , stumbling and perishing before they reached their goal . I came to uphold a settlement , an act of peace , Carringtontold himself . And now there is a new conflict , and I am its cause . How can that be , when I had barely time to shake their hands ? In bewilderment he looked beyond the fort to the west , where Red Cloud and the Sioux had gone to lie in wait for him , where he would follow , and where now the conical hills cast purplish shadows in the late afternoon.  |p123The  commissioners were meeting with the remnants of the Indian nations as Carrington led his column past Fort Laramie . He was heading for little-known country , but riding beside him as chief guide and adviser was Jim Bridger , the wisest and the most experienced of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mountains with Ashley'sfur company in 1822 . He had discovered and mapped South Pass , the Great Salt Lake , and many of the wonders of the Yellowstone . He had navigated with Mike Fink and hunted with Kit Carson ; he had suffered the fanaticism of Brigham Young and the brutality of General Connor ; he had married an Indian woman , and carried an Indian arrow in his back for two years until it was cut out by Dr. Marcus Whitman . In 1864 Bridger had led the first emigrant train from Laramie to Virginia City . The route he had chosen , along the western front of the Big Horns , was the long way around , and the hard way . But it passed through Shoshonecountry , and the Shoshones permitted travelers to pass in peace.  |p124John  Bozeman , in contrast , had scorned Bridger 's caution . An emigrant himself and a stranger to the West , he had taken his wagons over a short cut  --  through the huntinggrounds of the Cheyennes and the Sioux . The emigrantshad followed him ; the government had supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Second Battalion up the Bozeman Trail . The trail crossed the North Platte and struck out for the mountains one hundred and fifty miles to the northwest . It wound among red buttes and sage-covered dunes . It led through many creeks , some dry , some from whose alkaline taste even the mules turned away in disgust . The battalion suffered from thirst ; it took heavy punishment from the midsummer sun . At Reno Station , the last of the Army outposts , it halted ten days to rest the men and repair the wagons . The repairs did not last long . The temperature rose to one hundred and thirteen degreeson the march to Crazy Woman 's Crossing . The wagon tires split and fell off in that heat ; old soldiers opened veins in their wrists and sucked their own blood ; horses broke down and some died , including the Colonel 's favorite . Standing by its shallow grave as his sons wept , Carrington wondered if he had been foolhardy  --  bringing so much that was fragile from the East . He remembered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're still going , then ? " " Of course ! " " And you 're still taking the women and children ? " " I have no choice ; it 's too late now to send them back . " Was it really too late ? he wondered . Should I have forced them , against their wishes , to return ? For these hardships are almost more than they can endure . Yet , day by day the mountains stood taller and closer , bringing cool winds and the promise of rest . As the column passed beneath the eastern battlement of thep125range , the weariness of spirit that weighed down the men fell away . They tramped with a quickened pace across valleys and foothills , hoping that each day 's march might be the last . For one hundred and fifty miles the range rises , north to south . Halfway along it a headland thrusts out toward the east , forming a divide . It shoulders off the mountains in rock cliffs and forests of fir . It dips in a saddle and reaches on along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after the Spanishwho first ventured there . Its extension is known as Lodge Trail Ridge . The northern face of the ridge is steep ; it knifes into troubled country , filled with hillocks and thickets ; animalsbound away through the undergrowth , and hidden trails wind along ravines . In contrast , the southern slope of the ridge slants evenly downward to a mountain stream . Across the stream a second ridge rises , an inner and smaller rim of Lodge Trail that is known as Sullivant Hills . Like Lodge Trail , it stands sheer to the north , and to the south slides into a gentle valley , the loveliest of many that lie along the range . The mountains shield it from the worst of the winter ; in summer they lift the western winds and draw rain that brightens the valley while the plains around are parched and pale . A few miles to the east , life clings to a bare hold in the badlands , the boneyardof dinosaurs ; in the valley it flourishes . The earth is rich there , the grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across a green and rounded palm . A third ridge , known as Pilot Hill , forms the valley 's southern rim . The Bozeman Trail follows its outer contourswestward and crosses over it at the base of the mountains . There , on the afternoon of July 13 , Bridgerp126led the Carrington expedition . Riding at the old man 's side , the Colonel looked with delight at the country below . Why go farther ? he asked himself ; all that I need is here . Halfway down the valley the column crossed the stream . Its flow was plentiful ; its water was clear and sweet . With a sense of mounting excitement the Colonel rode on . One mile below the crossing a wide plateau reached across the entrance to the valley . Carrington rode up its embankment onto the even platform , large enough for a fort . He dismounted and studied the setting . The grass ripening around him offered fodder for the winter . In the mountains beyond , pines by the thousands stood , ready to be cut for the stockade . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided an ample and secure supply of water . As for defense  --  no hostile fire from the hills around could reach the fortress . Yet from within its walls the mountain howitzer that the Colonel had brought up from Reno could command the surrounding slopes . Moreover , the sides of the plateau formed a natural glacis ; their angle of forty-five degrees was ideal for defensive fire . Here , then , a fort could be held by a small force , if necessary . Yet , like the city of Saint Matthew , it stood in the open , at the crossing of many Indian trails . The site was the natural middle ground of Crows , Snakes , Cheyennes , Arapahoes , and Sioux . They might not claim equal right to it , but it was to all a friendly field . The Colonel turned to his map ; he confirmed that the stream was the Little Piney  --  yes , and the Big Piney curved around the end of Sullivant ; flowing south , it joined the Little Piney just beyond the plateau . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he read once again the Order that had started the Second Battalion on itsp127way west . It directed the battalion to establish a new post " on or near the Piney Fork of Powder River . " To the Colonel the Order seemed too good to be true . Only a handful of officers have ridden into this valley , he told himself , yet the War Department showed perfect foresight in picking it . For the site is faultless . It is as if it had been placed here by Divine Providence for this purpose , and had awaited our coming since the beginning of time . The troops marched up onto the plateau . The Colonel , as he looked on , was stirred and shaken by a new sense of kinship for his men . It seemed in turn to be reflected in their mood . " Are we staying , sir ? " they called out . At his nod they moved on , cheering . Brown , as he rode past on the pony , waved in a grandiloquent salute . Judge Kinney came up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything to show more fair , ' " he declared ; he would have recited the rest of the sonnet , but the Colonel moved off by himself . It is not what I am owed , he told himself , but what I owe . Remembering Samuel 's ancient offering , he searched among the lupin and the flax until he found a stone . He set it upright on the ground and called it Ebenezer , murmuring : " Hitherto hath the Lord helped us . ' " BY THE LITTLE PINEY , July 14At sunrise on his second day by the Little Piney , Carringtonset out like a lord to inspect his realm . Jim Bridger rode at his side ; an escort of mounted infantry followedp128a small escort . For the Colonel knew that he was being watched , and he was anxious to convey a sense of assuranceto the Sioux . The Colonel and his party rode to the edge of the badlandsand back . They found cannel coal within a mile of the plateau and timber without limit where the Big Piney tumbled from the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trail Ridge and down into the valleys of the Goose and the Tongue . They saw elk , buffalo , and bear , and , in the distance , Indians . But no Indians threatened them , although they advanced into the strongholdof the Sioux . At twilight , after a tour of sixty miles , Carrington led his party back onto the plateau . There he was met by Adair . A white intruder had come in a stealthy manner to the camp site ; Adair , as officer of the day , had arrested him and was holding him as a spy . The prisoner told a different story . He was , he insisted , a teamster who had set out in search of gold and ended in the employment of a trader , French Pete . The Frenchmanhad toured the Indian villages on the far side of Lodge Trail Ridge , trading his wagonloads of trinkets and tobacco for buffalo robes . In time he had arrived at the principal village of the Cheyennes . There the Cheyennechief , Black Horse , had summoned the onetime teamster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back with a message to Carrington . Adair proposed to charge the man with spying . Carringtonwaved him aside . He thanked the teamster and apologized for his detention . Reassured , the prisoner deliveredhis message : We want to know does the White Chief want peace or war ? Tell him to come with a black white man.  | " A black white man ? " Carrington was puzzled . " He means Jack Stead , " said the teamster , " your interpreter , the one with the Cheyenne squaw . " Bridger was doubtful ; even Stead suspected trickery . Carrington saw a source of hope in the sensitive and equivocal position of the Cheyennes . He wrote out his answer : To the Great Chief of the Cheyennes : Friend : A young white man tells me that you wish to come and talk with me . I shall be happy to have you come and tell me what you wish . The Great Father at Washingtonwishes to be your friend and so do all my soldiers . I tell all the white men that go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ponies I will follow and catch them and punish them . I will not let white men do hurt to the Indians who wish peace . You may come and see me with two other chiefs and two of your big fighting men when the sun is overhead after two sleeps . You may come and talk and no one shall hurt you and when you wish to go , you may go in peace and no one shall hurt you . I will tell all my chiefs and soldiers that you are my friends and they will obey . Your white friend , Henry B. CarringtonColonel r8th InfantryCommanding the Mountain DistrictThe ridges were dark when Stead and the teamster set out to deliver the message . They rode through the night and into the morning without finding the village . The Cheyennes , it turned out , had shadowed the team/ster with a second messenger . On learning of the teamster'sarrest , they had grown fearful and had retreated thirty miles north down the Tongue . There Stead found them . So , after two sleeps , when the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old Indian trail on the north slope of Lodge Trail Ridge . There were more chiefs than Carrington had invited , for the Cheyennes wished to impress the Colonel . There were many followers , for the Cheyennes , being wanderers , brought their families along . Black Horse rode in the lead , wearing his finest headdress , his heaviest necklace of grizzly claws . The teamster rode beside him , kept there partly as a hostage against white treachery , partly for recognition 's sake . Behind them rode the subchiefs : Dull Knife and Bobtail Horse ; Little Moon and Pretty Bear ; The Rabbit That Jumps and The Wolf That Lies Down ; Brave Soldier and The Man Who Stands Alone on the Ground . Dull Knife wore a deerskin jacket , Little Moon an old soldier 's shirt , Bobtail Horse a beaver hat and a richly woven blanket . Brave Soldier alone was dressed for the heat of the day . In a breechcloth and moccasins  --  nothing more  --  he sat under an umbrella , one of French Pete 's . Behind the warriors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the chiefs followed and the women , leadingp131the ponies that dragged the travois . High on the travois rode the babies , imprisoned in round cages , peering out and never murmuring as they jolted over rocks and down ravines . In the youth of Black Horse his people had moved across open ground , leaving the back trails to Pawnee and Crow . Now the old chief led them up a hidden path traveled by the hunted and shielded from whites and Sioux . The riders drove their horses up gulleys ; they bent beneath stunted trees ; they suffered the tears of thorn bushes : rose , chapparal , and allthorn , the one whose crimson spikes point every way . They crossed over a dip at the shoulder of the ridge and wound down into the bottomland of Piney Island . Here they had wintered often , felling cottonwood for fires and lodgepole pine for travois and tepee . They heard the sharp sounds of axes ; the shouts of the wood choppers ; the tearing noise of tall pines cracking , stripping the branches from other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the edge of the pine wood they came to the upper ford of Big Piney , the crossing worn smooth by centuries of Indian migration . The ponies drank deeply , halted , and raised their heads , pointing forked ears to the south . Black Horse signaled to the old men to follow slowly . Then , with pennons flying , the warriors rode up and across the long brow of Sullivant Hills . Below them the grassland , turning golden , trembled for two miles down the valley . Knowing this land , his people 's , Black Horse looked from one familiar point to another . Wagon tracks scarred the earth now at the crossing of the Little Piney ; the stand of ponderosa pine was already diminished . In the rich lowlands the horse herds of the Army grazed . And on the plateau where a Cheyenne village had wintered , the white tents of thep132white men formed precise rows . At the high peak of Sullivant , where Black Horse had driven buffaloes tumblingto their death , a sentry signaled , holding his horse and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ridge another sentry repeated the signal . The Cheyennes watched and listened . They heard far down in the valley the faint screech of a power saw cutting timber . Up the wood trail toward them a wagon train crept , drawn by oxen and guarded by a cavalry escort . The cavalry escort halted on seeing the Cheyennes . The blue riders drew long rifles out of their saddle holsters . They laid them loaded across their pommels ; they advanced . The hands of the warriors moved toward hidden weapons , but Black Horse shook his head . His hand tightened instead upon a bundle of ragged cloth that enclosed the magic emblems sent by the gods to protect his people : a knuckle of soft rock known as buffalo stone and the jawbone and claws of a white beaver two hundred years old . " Why , " Ten Eyck muttered , following Carrington around the hospital tent , " why the full dress ? " He felt ridiculous before his own men , decked out in sash and saber , helmet and plume , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was smoothing the American flag over the operating table . " Why ? Because the Indians attach great importance to form . Tenedore , " he continued , " I want you , as post commander , at my right . You , Stead , stand here behind me . You , Frederick , " he said to Phisterer , " sit at the end of the table where you can record the entire proceeding . And Bridger will stay in front , where he can watch the chiefs . " " I still do n't see . . . " Ten Eyck protested . In these ar/rangements , as in all others , he was learning that he was post commander in name only . " I still do n't see what you hope to gain . . . Carrington had driven stakes at two-hundred-yard intervalsto the north and the west as far as his mountain howitzer would carry . Now , looking from point to point , he gauged the distance of the Cheyennes as they rode slowly down the valley . " Eighteen hundred yards , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They are not just Indians , as you and I are not just whites . We are Americans . They are Cheyennes . " " Cheyennes , then . I still do n't see . . . " " Once again , " Carrington said , ' let me explain . This land that we occupy was the land of the Crows . The Cheyennes took it from them one hundred years ago . Then the Sioux moved in . The Cheyennes and the Sioux are hereditary enemies . The Sioux and the whites are present enemies . The Sioux are pressing the Cheyennes to join them against the whites ; I want the Cheyennes to stand with us against the Sioux . " " I still do n't see . . . Carrington had stopped once more by the door of the tent . " Sixteen hundred yards , " he said . He glanced over to the turf , marked out for the parade ground , where the bandsmen were lined up in full dress uniform . " When they are one thousand yards off , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escort them in . " " One band of Indians , " Ten Eyck persisted . " Why waste a day when every man should be  --  " " Because , Captain "  --  Carrington was adjusting his saber  --  " there are just four hundred men in your command , and upwards of thirty thousand Indians all around us . Because those thirty thousand include the Tetonp134Sioux , the great fighters of the plains , who have yet to be tested in combat against the troops of the United States . " " Great fighters ! I 'll take ten men who served under Sherman and  --  " " Fourteen hundred yards . " Ten Eyck stared at the procession winding down the trail . " Spies , " he muttered . " Why show our fort to spies ? " Carrington was glancing over his papers . " Of course they are spies , " he said . " As we would be in their villages . And that is partly why I welcome them . Bring them in slowly , " he said to Adair , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the blockhouses will be and how high the stockade will rise . Tell them that sentries will be on guard here day and night . And be quite sure that they understand that many , many more troops will be sent to us . Above all , make sure that they see the howitzer ; if necessary , we 'll fire a shot to impress them . Then when the Sioux question them Red Cloud will learn that we are here to stay . " Ten Eyck stood close to Phisterer . " You may appreciate these theories , " he muttered . " I tell you the men wo n't . To them  --  " " Frederick , " Carrington called out . " I want that list of presents again . " " Here , Colonel . " The adjutant read from a pad : " Two Springfields , unusable ; three officer 's jackets ; two shakos ; one lady 's umbrella ; two lady 's mirrors ; twenty pounds of tobacco ; four boxes of sugar ; three sacks apiece of flour , bacon , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace pipe ? " Phisterer patted his pocket . " My own . " Carrington glanced back to the hillside . Eleven hundred yards or less ; by now the pennons were colorful andp135clear . He motioned , and Adair rode out to meet the Cheyenneswith his escort . The Indians paused and moved on warily . Adair drew up at attention before them ; he salutedwith his saber as the ragged files moved past . Then he fell into line behind them , taking them under the protection of the regiment . Beside the hospital tent the bandsmen were drawn up in ranks . As the Cheyennes passed the five-hundredyardmarker , Carrington motioned again and the band marched off  --  in perfect silence . One hundred yards out the baton rose and fell ; suddenly the horns and drums sounded in all their magnificence . The Indian ponies reared and tried to bolt , the Cheyennes struggled with them , and Adair held up a white glove in warning . In pride and consternation the Cheyennes moved on , their anxiety mounting step by step as the band marched towardthe inevitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then all will be lost ; but they rode on . At the last possible moment Schubert signaled , pivoted , marched back through his men . The band became a jostlingmass , and then from the mass Schubert emerged , baton high , leading the parade back down the trail . So with the formality of a regimental review the Cheyenne chiefs were escorted onto the plateau , where the Colonel and his staff waited in line and a crowd of soldiers and civilians looked on . From his blanket Black Horse drew his red sandstone pipe . In silence he stuffed Phisterer 's tobacco into it , lit it , and passed it along . Carrington sucked upon it with concealed distaste and watched it move around the table . A half-hour passed in meditation . Ten Eyck muttered to himself ; Bridger smoked in silence ; Phisterer worked on his regimental reports ; Carrington studied the Chey/ennes . He noted the contrast between Bobtail Horse 's Asiatic face and Dull Knife 's Western forehead and fine mouth . He studied in fascination two medallions that dangled on Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipe and hatchet crossed , two hands clasped , and a motto : PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP . On the other he recognizeda man 's head in outline , the swan 's neck rising from the ruffles , the hair tied in a ribbon behind : Thomas Jefferson . The auspices seemed reassuring to Carrington until he saw hanging from Dull Knife 's jacket six bands of human hair  --  his trophies . Black Horse sat without stirring . Only the bold profile of Jefferson rose and sank , upon a vest of eagle 's bones . The old chief seemed to have fallen asleep , and the Colonel was about to awaken him when he rose and made the familiar opening address . An hour wore along with its burden of victories over the Crows , hardships caused by the disappearance of the buffalo , and wrongs committedby the Army and the emigrants . Black Horse dwelt next upon the well-known virtues of the Great Father , who would doubtless restore the balance of all things . Ten Eyck breathed noisily , close to sleep ; Phisterer wrote steadily without looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite tent ; and Carringtonnodded politely . At last they came to grips . Standing before his warriors , Black Horse swept his right hand from left to right ; he signaled seven , then five ; he drew his right forefinger across his left forefinger and looked across the table to Stead . " The great chief speaks for one hundred and seventyfivelodges of Cheyennes , " Stead said . Black Horse rubbed his forefingers together . The Cheyennes . . . He pointed ahead with forked fingers.  |p137.  . have been hunting . . . " He raised both hands to the sides of his head and flapped them. . . geese . " The chief curled his thumb and forefinger around an imaginary cup and drank from it . Stead corrected himself : " . . . have been hunting along Goose Creek . . . " The chief stuck out his tongue and tapped it with his forefinger . Then he repeated the drinking sign . " And down Tongue River . " He held out a trembling hand and suddenly drew his right forefinger across his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He repeated the sign for cutthroat . The motions that followed were too swift for the Colonel to follow . But Stead nodded . " The Sioux said that the white soldiers stopped at the fort to the south . They mended their wagons . " " That is true , " Carrington said . " It proves that the Cheyennes are speaking the truth . " " It proves also "  --  Phisterer laid down his pen  --  " that the Sioux are organized under one command from Reno Station to the Big Horn River and that they know every step we take . " Carrington nodded . " It is good of the great chief of the Cheyennes , " he said , " to tell us so much . " Black Horse listened with a grave air . He was pleased . He bowed slightly toward Carrington as he motioned . " The Little White Man , " Stead translated , " is a good chief . " " The Little White Man ! " Carrington was disconcerted . The chiefs were swift to note his altered mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , theyp138held a hurried conference . Grandly Black Horse amended his phrase . " Two Spread Eagles is a good chief . " Carrington smiled . " I hope to write the Great Father that Black Horse is also a good chief . A good chief and a loyal friend . " Stead motioned ; the Cheyennes swayed and muttered . As he watched them Carrington saw a tiny yellow spider circling the base of Brave Soldier 's neck , rushing around in a distraught manner and appearing at a different place each time . The warrior noticed his glance , and Carringtonlooked quickly at Black Horse . The chief 's forefinger snapped outward . " The Sioux said . . . " He rubbed his forefingers. . . that the Cheyennes . . . " He laid one vertical palm along the other , struck his left hand with his right , and thrust both forward. . . must unite with them . . . " He pointed his bony finger and drew it across his brow between the deep furrows that ran unbroken from one side to the other. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He pointed dramatically to the ground and shook his fist. . . right here you stop ! " " Here ? At the Piney ? " The Colonel 's question started the Cheyennes mutteringand shifting on their chairs . Black Horse spoke for them . He drew his finger once more across his throat ; he waved one hand around the top of his head  --  the mad sign . He smoothed his braids . " The Sioux said the white soldiers must go back below the Crazy Woman 's Crossing , " Stead said.  | " That is impossible ! " Carrington cried . The Cheyennes nodded . The old chief turned to his warriors , stretching his hands apart as if he were pulling toffee . " He says he is finished , " Stead murmured ; but Pretty Bear spoke urgently and the old man turned back . He repeated the now familiar gestures . Stead translated : " A second party of white soldiers is on its way from Laramie . The Sioux are riding south to cut them off . " " Where ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief circled his head and stroked his braids . " They are too late , " Ten Eyck said . He grinned , contented , but Phisterer stared off to the mountains , dividingmiles by days . Black Horse looked back at his warriors . They had no more to say . Bobtail Horse and Dull Knife sat like umber statues . The Rabbit searched beneath his blanket for a louse . Around the root of Brave Soldier 's neck the yellow spider appeared . It paused as if it , too , felt that the next move was up to someone else . Then it set off in a new direction and disappeared into a dark armpit . Carrington looked at his officers . " There are many details , " Phisterer said . Carrington nodded . " Thank the great chief for all he has told his white friends , " he said to Stead . " And ask himif we may impose upon him with a few questions . " " He is pleased to answer , " Stead confirmed . " Ask him who is the great chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horse nodded as if he had known for a hundred years that this question was coming . He made the blood sign and pointed upward . " Red Cloud . " " Ask him how many warriors are with Red Cloud . " Black Horse held out his full fist ; he sprang five fin/gers out and swept his arm across his chest . He worked his forefingers up and down like the pistons of an engine . " Five hundred warriors . " Carrington was pleased , but Bridger shook his head . " Five hundred now , when they 're supposed to be laying in buffalo meat for the winter . That means five thousand before snow flies . " Carrington nodded . He said : " Ask Black Horse what other chiefs stand with Red Cloud . " The chiefs were disturbed ; they spoke and gestured together . Black Horse silenced them and motioned in rapid , continuous gestures . " Man Afraid is with Red Cloud , " said Stead . " He is one day 's march north on Tongue River . " Carrington closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure of Man Afraid , and Red Cloud , contorted with bitterness and hatred , as Carrington had last seen him at Laramie . He said : " Ask Black Horse what Red Cloud and Man Afraid told the Cheyennes about the meeting in Laramie . " Black Horse repeated the familiar motions . " They said they went to Laramie . . . " The chief rocked an invisible baby in his arms. . . to talk about . . . He ground his fists together and flipped his hand over . . . no more fighting . " Black Horse made several swift and blurred motions , and Stead had difficulty in keeping pace . " They said the white men from Washington spoke . But before they finished , the Two Spread Eagles came with many soldiers to take away the Indians ' hunting ground and build forts before they could say yes or no . " The chief paused . Evidently it embarrassed him to repeatdisparaging remarks about his host . But Dull Knifep141and Bobtail Horse spoke in low voices , urging him to say more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Sioux said . . . He stroked his brow and raised two forked fingers . " The coyote sign , " Stead explained . " The Sioux said the whites cheated them . " " Tell Black Horse there was no cheating ! " Carrington was indignant . " Ask Black Horse if he will give in to the Sioux who lie ! Ask him if he will go to war against his white friend ! " The chiefs watched Stead with anxiety ; they seemed greatly agitated . Black Horse nodded many times as Dull Knife and the others spoke . He answered in a low voice , as if he did not wish his people , squatting outside the tent , to hear what he would say . " The Cheyennes , " Stead translated , " are few . They can not fight the Sioux . " Carrington was still upset . " I understand that , " he cried . " The question is : will Black Horse fight with the Sioux against the Two Spread Eagles ? " The old chief watched Stead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke all together and he hushed them , pressing down with his palms as a conductormight . He made the Cheyenne sign and drew his right hand slowly across his stomach . " The Cheyennes are hungry , " Stead translated . He murmured : " I can vouch for that . " The chief turned to Carrington and with a long gesture seemed to draw the Colonel down into himself . " They need provisions . " Ten Eyck nudged Carrington , meaning : I told you . Carrington shook his head . Suddenly he felt overdressed and ill at ease in his silk sash and ribbon , his gold epau-142lets and silver-handled saber . He saw , beneath the brave show , the Cheyennes in their poverty . He wished that he had not attempted to overawe them . He murmured : " Ask the great chief what we can do for him . " Ten Eyck drew back , disgusted ; Bridger poked at his pipe ; Stead translated , and all the chiefs spoke and gesturedat once . Evidently they mentioned many needs . Brave Soldier was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black Horse nodded . In his statesmanlike way he mentionedfirst the most respectful of their requests . " They say they would like to have The Roman Nose "  --  Stead nodded toward Phisterer as he spoke . " They say he can teach them the White Father 's ways . " Stead leaned across to Phisterer . " They are impressed by your guttural voice , " he murmured . " They say you talk like an Indian . " Ten Eyck guffawed ; at least he would take one good story from the meeting . Phisterer rose and bowed . " Tell the chief I am honored , " he said . " If I were single , I would be pleased to join his village . But , alas , I am betrothed . " Stead nodded . He combed his fingers through imaginarybraids and laid his forefingers alongside each other , meaning : He is spliced . Too bad ; the chiefs shook their heads in sympathy . Black Horse moved on to the next among his needs . He tilted his head back ; he thrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " He stroked his lean sides : . . and clothes . " He thrust his right hand out palm downward from his heart.  | " It will be good . " He pointed his right arm upward and westward over the mountains that shone in the late sun . " They will go far away to the mountains of the Wind River . " " Good ! " Ten Eyck said . Stead disagreed . " They will meet hostile tribes there . " " So much the better . Let 's hope they kill each other . " By now it was late afternoon . Adair came into the tent with orders for the new guard . His appearance , or some new factor , sent a shiver through the Cheyennes . The officers noticed nothing and Bridger seemed unconcerned . But Carrington was unnerved . He called to Stead to find out what had happened . " They ask if they can talk among themselves . " " Of course . " Carrington watched them move off and crouch close in a corner of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My purposes are beyond question , he told himself . And yet the unpleasant image of the coyote returned to mock his pretensions . Adair bent over with Orders to sign . " I showed them the fortifications , " he said loudly . " I told them that we had enough powder to blow up all the Sioux . I pointed out the howitzer and I said it could kill them all . " He stood up , sighing . " I only wish it could . " Ten Eyck rose and edged out of the tent , muttering that he needed fresh air . Stead drifted off after him . Bridger waged a grim struggle with many matches against a crooked and obstinate pipe . Carrington sat alone . I have demanded more than they could give , he thought . I have made enemies of men who might have been my friends . At last the Indians rose . They called for Stead ; theyp144spoke in low voices . When , in turn , Stead leaned close to whisper , Carrington recoiled from the fume of raw whisky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength of his village he did not tell you that his young men  --  one hundred and twenty-five of them  --  have gone south to Arkansas , hunting buffalo and raiding Pawnee villages .

" " Then they must go back at once . " " They say they will send a messenger . They will start for the Wind River and the others will catch them up . " " That is all they said ? " " Black Horse says that he trusts you and has smoked the pipe with you . He will leave you a hundred young warriors to fight the Sioux . " " Tell him I have enough men to fight Red Cloud . But tell him also that if he keeps faith with us and has trouble with the Sioux , then we will fight to protect him . " " We could use a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Bowers to bring the presents , and as Bowers moved off , he called him back . " Leave the Springfields , " he said . " Bring one of my revolvers instead ! " So the negotiations ended . Along the parade ground the participants lined up , the whites on one side , the Cheyennes on the other . Bowers brought to Carrington each sack and bundle , Carrington passed it on : the coffee and the flour , hauled over hundreds of miles ; the umbrella , bought by Margaret Carrington in Chicago ; the officer 's jackets , worn through the war ; the two shakos ,  |p145a|p|pro|priated  by Bowers from protesting privates . The last gift was the revolver . Carrington drew it from its holster , ran one finger along the blue barrel , looked down the sights for the last time , rubbed clean the name of Sarni Colt , and handed it to Black Horse , saying : " May this protect you ! " The chief took the revolver . He motioned . Stead said : " He hopes you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand on Carrington'sshoulder . He spoke in a low voice , and only Stead heard what he said . Then he beckoned , and the squaws brought forward the ponies . The chiefs mounted and raised their right hands in the peace sign . Then they headed back up the valley . Once they were beyond earshot everyone began to laugh . " . . . that umbrella . . . " " . . . the old man 's way . . " . . . the stench ! . . . " The way the squaws looked at Phisterer ! " Ten Eyck cried . " And at you , " Stead said . " You should have heard what they said about you . " " What were they saying ? " Stead laughed . " They had names for all of you . Good names , too . " " Tell us ! Tell us ! " But Stead would not , for the names were too pointed . They had named Ten Eyck Ehavessexahne , The DroopingEye ; Bowers Hotoauxtan , The Bullskin ; Kinney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but since the crowd pressed him , he seemed to give in . " They called Lieutenant Phisterer Wochanayt , The Roman Nose , " he said . Carrington stood apart from his men , watching thep146Cheyennes move up the valley . He was only half aware of his own thoughts until a heavy-set figure moved up and stood beside him . Kinney took a cigar from his vest pocket , bit off the end , and lit it in his careful way . " The departure of our red brothers seems to sadden you , " he said . " It does . " " May I ask why ? " " They are passing . They have conquered this country and held it for generations . Now the shadow of the advancingwhite man has fallen on their trail and they must pass on , as homeless wanderers , to the unknown . " " The shadow of the white man , " Kinney repeated . He drew deeply on his cigar . " I would say rather the rays of light cast by civilization , Christian civilization , across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , in his own way , Black Horse was as courteous and as farsighted as most of our elected representatives . And as courageous , " Carrington added , cuttingshort Kinney 's protest , " for he risked the property and lives of his people in coming to talk friendship and peace with me today . And I fear the Sioux may wreak vengeance upon him for his good will . " " That may be , " Kinney said , " but , from what I know of the red man , I believe that blood and color run deeper than good will . I believe they will be against us on the day of reckoning . " " They have more reason than we to fear the Sioux . " " That is what concerns me , " Kinney said . " For the red man is governed by his fears . If the Cheyenne fears the Sioux and does not fear us , then he will be found on the side of the Sioux and against us . " Carrington said nothing , watching the Cheyennes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added : " It was a mistake , if I may say so , to present the chief with arms . " Carrington felt again the acute loneliness he had experiencedat Laramie . He said : " What would you have me do ? " " First subdue them . Teach them that submission is the primary duty of the savage , as it is of civilized man . " " And then ? " " When they are humbled , force them into reserva-tions . " " It will not work . They will not give in . " " Why do you say that ? " " Because Black Horse said it to me . He came to me as we parted , to speak to me alone . He said : The white man wants all . He will have it all ; but the red man will die where his father died . ' " Kinney 's cigar was burning low . He drew on it vigorously . " Then you must decide where you stand , " he said . " Must I ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who chose to fight to the death rather than to surrender . " " And on the other ? " " The Army  --  your own officers , who will fight them to the death . " " And I ? " " I have the impression , if you will pardon my saying so , that you are still committed to the reconciliation of ir-reconcilables . " Phisterer moved up beside them . He asked : " May I speak ? " " What is it ? " " You recall the chief 's report , about a second party of white soldiers riding north ? " " What of it ? "  | " I have checked the dispatches . A small detachment was due to leave Laramie ten days ago . It is led by LieutenantTempleton . " It includes women and children , " Phisterer added . " Also the chaplain White and the photographer Glover . It has very few fighting men . " " I understand . " " If the old chief , Black Horse , is right in saying that a war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Crossing , then , " Phisterer persisted , " by my calculations the small detachment should arrive at the crossing at noon on the day after tomorrow . " Carrington turned as Phisterer 's warning pierced the veils of his sadness . " When is the dispatch rider leaving for Reno ? " he demanded . " Tomorrow morning , Colonel , at dawn . " " Then send him out at once and give him a message for Templeton . Tell Templeton to wait at Reno until a larger convoy comes through . " Phisterer smiled . " Thank you , sir . " 16000ON THE BOZEMAN TRAIL , July 18-21Two days after the meeting between Carrington and the Cheyennes a small column plodded into Reno Station . Its commanding officer dismounted and presented himself : " Lieutenant Templeton and detachment , under orders to join the Eighteenth Infantry at Fort Carrington . "  |p149The  captain of Reno glanced at the column . " You 'd better wait , " he said , " until a larger convoy comes through . " Templeton shook his head . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push along . " " Our scouts report Sioux raiding along the trail . " " Then they 're misinformed . The commissioners at Laramie assured us that we 'd have no trouble , all the way . " At dawn on July 20 the column moved out from Reno . At sunset it camped by a waterless tributary of the PowderRiver . Few of the men slept through the stifling night . One officer , Napoleon Daniels , was seized by a presentimentof his imminent death . He rose and joined a young sentry , Stanley Peters . They walked up and down , conversing , until at the end of the night the guard was called in . At daybreak the column moved on up the trail . Three hours of marching brought it to the Dry Fork of the PowderRiver . The soldiers had been promised water there ; instead they came upon the naked body of a white man , lying face down in the dry sand as if still drinking . The detachment halted long enough to bury the dead man , then labored on up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before noon it reached the divide . The wife of Lieutenant Wands was the first to feel the cool wind . She looked up ; she saw the plain descending to twenty miles of meadow , rising again in the far distance in a blue rock wall , and towering over it the peaks : higher than any I ever dreamed of , she thought , and snowcovered , so brilliant in the sunshine that they seem like clouds , or else the clouds forming around them are like still higher peaks.  | " Alex . . . " She moved her arm slightly to touch her husband , and the child held within it shifted his small weight against her ribs and sank back into sleep . " Look ! " Wands looked up , along the range , and back to the crude map held across his knees . " The high peak is Cloud Peak , " he said , " and the far headland I think is Peno Head . " " Do the names matter ? I thought I married a poet ! " Or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those composers on the cover of my music scores , those fulsomesideburns and that far-off look . The way he looked when he courted me , even when he worked his way around to the subject of love . I think there are two componentsto love , he said : respect and desire ; as if it were some section of the common law . And I brought him back to me , saying : I feel both for you . Wands pushed a forefinger along the ink lines of the map . " If that is Peno Head , " he continued , " then in one of those folds of rock between here and the horizon the Eighteenth Infantry is based . " Only that far ? I 'll be sorry , she thought ; for we 've been together on this journey , for the first time since our marriage . And once we join all the others I 'll never see him , I know . " And if this map is accurate "  --  Wands glanced ahead , where the wagon tracks wandered down a gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hidden river in the plain below them  --  " we 're coming to Crazy Woman 's Crossing . " " At last , " she murmured , looking westward and seeing now the shades of fire in the blue rock wall and the changing shapes of the clouds rising around Cloud Peak . Thirteen thousand feet , that crest , so Alex said . On the plain a herd of antelope twisted to stare at them ; a hawkp151circled overhead , the sunlight shining through its pennons ; from the ground close by , a black bird , a lark bunting , ascended into the sky and fluttered downward with the convulsive motions of a butterfly , singing all the way until it sank among the sage . She shivered slightly in the cool air flowing from those heights of snow . " Alex , " she began , " I need the scarf you . . . But her husband was looking off to the right of the train , where Daniels rode guard . " Damned fool , " he muttered , " digging his spurs in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on edge this morning . As Wands looked on , Daniels pulled the horse 's head down and rode in a sidewisecanter up to the ambulance . He pointed and Wands saw on a low hill to the east four gray beasts watching them from ground freshly dug . " Wolves , " panted Daniels . " I wonder . . . " " If you want orders , go to Templeton , not me . " Daniels drew out his revolver and charged . The men trudging along in the column groaned in a cheer or jeer . The wolves loped off just out of range . They waited  --  intelligent animals with high shoulders and low haunches and long , slender legs . Daniels forced his horse up to their quarry ; he cantered back , distaste contorting his pale face . " A gray horse , " he said . Ahead of them the first cracks parted the plain ; tentaclesdeepening and widening toward the river . One long reach of the plain curved unbroken to a high bluff along the riverbank . Good ground to fight on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every train that 's passed this way must have nooned there . In any case , the trail descended into a ravine that wound off to the east . " Follow the trail , " orderedTempleton , riding alongside the ambulance . " Danielsand I are going ahead to find a place where the horses can graze . "  |p152Away  down the westward slope bright flowers beckoned . She eased the child over to her husband 's side and stepped down onto the parched earth . The orange cluster , the robinia that she reached for first , proved to be prickly and dull . But beyond , the others danced : the corydalis , a yellow thread between the sage ; the delicate whitlow grass ; the brown-eyed susan that reminded her of meadows at home ; cleome , the blue pincushion ; the tiny androsace . She wandered off ; when she looked back , the little train seemed entirely apart . Apart and absurd : Alex in the driver 's seat of the lead ambulance ; poor Mrs. Fessendenin the next one with the colored laundresses , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers regarding her in silence as they trudged along ; the supply wagons creaking down the hillside ; the three officers riding in the rear . So small in the landscape , all of them  --  a company of toy soldiers marching across a nursery carpet . She turned back toward the mountains . The milk vetch wound its trellis beneath her ; and there the blue horn of the larkspur nodded , the monkscap ; a tall pink flower beyond it , the poisonous one that kills the animals ; and there 's the one we passed so many times this morning , those golden seashells dangling from the stem  --  amber inside , a shell 's inner life , and , drooping over the lobe , that sad little member . And there , by itself , a tentative childlike flower , its cloak of leaves enfoldingits yellow lips , parted for the bees . She wandered on in a trance until Alex 's voice crying " Jennie , Jennie ! " summoned her . Seated beside him , she sorted out her collection . " Look , Alex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those white spokes and yellow hub , but he 'd laugh if I said so . " And here 's another exactly like it , " only its leaves are soft and silver . " And this one , Alex , a heal-all ; for the quinsey ifp153ever you . . . " but you 're not listening . " And here 's a strange one , off by itself when I found it . An evening primrose . And look at this one , Alex , " she went on . " Look at these curious leaves . . . . " Like blind fingers reaching out to touch a familiar object ; a flower above them with lavender petals and , deep in its throat , veins of violet . " A kind of buttercup is n't it , Alex ? " She looked across at his set face . " You 're thinking about what we came upon this morning . " He nodded . " Why would n't you let me  --  " " It was n't a sight for a girl ; least of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I think so . " " Had he been there long ? " " I do n't know ; four days , perhaps . " She looked down to be certain that the child was not listening ; she whispered : " Was he mutilated ? " Wands shuddered . " I do n't want you to think any more about it ! " " He must have been a courier , " she said . " There were letters scattered all around . " " We gathered them up . " " Perhaps some were for us , Alex ! We should go through them . " " Please , Jennie . We will when we get to the crossing . " Oh , well . . . She picked up a tall and slender flower , the petals thin , the throat pale green . It must be a lily , shedecided . A lily for him , whoever he was . " Easy ! " Wands hauled back on the reins as the mule team plunged down into the gulley . The ambulance lurched forward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them Mrs. Fessenden wailed , fearing for her baby , as the second ambulance followed . " Heave ! "  |p154Wands  cried ; the mules struggled ; the ambulance rolled forward on firm ground ; the wagon tracks wound on toward the river . Still the flowers , sprouting from the banks : the gray sage with its faint fruit , the cactus with its wine-colored blossoms . Then the banks rose on both sides , too steep for flowers . The gulley narrowed and twisted into a ravine , and soon the mules were struggling again in sand . The lead ambulance was light enough , but the second one was heavy and the wagons were heavier still . Wands handed his wife the reins . " Keep moving ; do n't stop ! " He sprang down from the bench . " Alex , I . . . " He was gone . She sat looking at the reins he had thrust into her hands . What do I do if they bolt , or balk ? The four mules labored on . Some way back she heard his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reverend , and you , too , Mr. Glover . " The child looked up anxiously at her . " Close it up , there ! " Alex called out , far back . " All of you men , put your shoulders to the spokes ! " The ravine deepened now and curved to the right , into the deep shadow of the bluff . She glanced up and saw strange shapes in the eroded banks : ice cream when it smooths and begins to drip ; no ; spires , the flying buttresses of a mud cathedral ; no ; shrouded mummies leaning against those walls , their arms held rigidly along their sides , their faces smooth , bound beneath winding sheets . Alex . . . She listened for his voice . She heard a faint unearthly cry . A man or wild beast ? A pounding in the earth now , the cries of a hunting pack closing in . Around the bend a horse galloped , its eyes wild , its neck contorted ; a man swayed in the saddle , Templeton ; hard after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their spears aimed , their faces streaked scarlet and white . They swept past her , quarry and hunters together . Men shouted be/hind her , shots sounded , the mules reared and tore at the harness . Around the bend another horse pounded , the saddle bouncing along beneath his belly , the reins broken and trailing from his jaw ; two shafts bobbed in his withersas he thumped past . A blur crossed her vision ; a feathered stick , an arrow , quivered in the bench where the flowers wilted , between herself and the boy . She looked up ; she saw on the banks above her an umber figure , an Indian , his arm raised , drawing his bow again . " Alex ! " She fell back into the ambulance , shielding her son . She pressed down , flat along the floorboards , her fists clenched , her eyes shut ; the boy squirmed beneath her , struggling to free himself ; the ambulance swiveled in the sand as the mules bucked , trying to bolt four ways . Men ran past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprang up onto the driver 's bench . " Hup , damn your black souls ! " Up over the bankside the ambulance reared ; it heeled over on two rickety wheels , skidding in a circle : " Ho , curse you ! " The man leaned back ; as the ambulancehalted , something heavy and hard fell on the boards beside her . She looked up ; she saw blocking the light an angular figure : the chaplain , the Reverend White . " Heave , there ! . . . All together ! . . . Turn there !  |p156Close  it up ! . . . Unharness the mules , you idiots ! . . . No , leave them ! . . . Hold your damned fire ! " Alex 's voice and close by : " Poor devil 's stopped one in the belly , sir ; he 's done for .

" Ho , there ! " She heard the mules of the next wagon snorting . " Hold it ! " Then the thud as one slumped from the harness , down on buckled knees , over on his side . " Jesus , that was close ! " the soldier just beneath her said . " They . . . Here they come !

" My revolver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face of the Reverend , his long jaw thrust toward her , his hair sweeping upward like gray flames around his high dome , his wild eyes searching . " There !

" He pulled out a black cartridge case and pushed the white pellets into each barrel . " A little lively out there , " he said , grinning . " Pray for us , Reverend ! " " Pray ? " The Reverend was biting the cord off the last cartridge container , one that would not be thrust down . " There 's a time to pray . " He spat out the cord , emptiedp157the powder into the barrel , and jammed the ball after it . ' This is a time to fight ! " Holding the revolver high , he leaped off the bench and out of sight . Close by her head the canvas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a third arrow fell beside her . She turned to the boy ; she stuffed him under the shallow side bench . He fought to get out . " Here , take Pony Dits ! " His small fist closed around the woolly horse . " Please , Bobby ! " She pressed the mattress against him , walling him in . He thrust outward , the bulges in the mattresshis hands and knees . " Please be still ! " She lay along the mattress , pressing against it until his cries contractedinto gulping sobs . Dear God , she thought ; if the Reverend wo n't pray , I will : I know I have n't been to church as much as I should , but I " I still do n't see them , " the soldier beneath her said .

Swords thrust up from them , or beaks , birds ' beaks ; on stilts a great bird stood . It heaved itself up on heavy wings , spraying white against the blue sky as it labored upward into a realm where forty or fifty of them soared in a wide circle , storks between heaven and earth . " Damn ramrod ! " the soldier said beneath her . " Never was any good . Fire once and you 're finished for the day . Lend me yours . . . . That 's better . " He fired . " Got him ! I got one ! " " Hold your fire there ! " someone shouted from far off . " Hold my fire ! " " Hold your water ! " " He ca n't , "  |p158the  first soldier said ; " no more can I.

She brushed back her hair ; I must look like a . . . The sensitivefingers closed on the bolt ; the gate fell and Glover peered in . " Turn him around , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armful of boots . In their place the dark head of Lieutenant Templeton approached like a ramrod , thrust forward by a veteran , Sergeant Terrell . " I got him , Mr. Glover ; you go around inside ! " Glover crawled down from the driver 's bench and past her . He joined his hands under Templeton 's chest and dragged the lieutenant into the ambulance . " The mattress , " he panted . She pulled it out , uncovering her son , who lay quietly beneath the seat playing with Pony Dits . Glover laid the body alongside her , the blue shirt darkened and matted , the arms limp . Between the shoulder blades she saw the shaft , heaving and sinking ; he 's breathing . Outside , the din increased . The ambulance shuddered as the Reverend forced the mule team back and around , facing west . " Follow me ! " Wands shouted . " Keep as close to me as you can ! " He ran ahead , a revolver in eachp159hand . " Ho ! " White cried . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Off the knoll the ambulance jolted ; hard after it the wagons swung into line . Ahead , three Indians rose from the riverbank and rushed for the lead team . White stood , he lashed and slashed the whip . Two of the braves were ripped from the harness ; they slid past ; the third clung on , one hand gripping the lead mule 's neck , the other brandishing a knife to slit its throat . White flayed the red back until the knife fell , the arm hung limp ; the broken body slipped beneath the thrashing hoofs . Wands led the soldiers at a run along the ledge , heading for the bluff that he had dismissed as useless an hour before . A band of mounted Indians raced to cut him off . They wheeled on the hilltop . A shaft pierced the canvas by White 's neck . " Missed me ! " White shouted . " Missed me by . . . That 's the spirit , Lieutenant . That 's firing ! . . . Hup , there !

Let not the swift flee away , nor the mighty man escape ! Northward his quarry ran , over the bluff that towered above the river . They shall stumble , and fall toward the north by the river Euphrates ! When he had secured the reins , Glover climbed down into the ambulance . Lightly he touched the arrow in Templeton 's back . " Cord , " he said . " There 's cord bound around the bottom of the shaft . "  |p160She  barely heard him . How many times , she thought , I dreamed of wandering over all those battlefields they showed in Leslie 's , searching for Alex . And finding him lying abandoned , and binding his wounds . I was brave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream had come trueFrom the floor beside her Glover lifted another arrow . Along his forefinger he measured the distance from the point of the blade to the binding . " It 's deep , " he said , " but not deep enough to pierce his lung . " He waited , half in hope that she would take up the thought he had laid before her and stumble on with it . She stared at the arrow , thinking : Alex , Alex , if I had found you with this arrow driven in your back , I could n't have drawn it , not if your life depended on it . Glover raised himself . " We 'll have to pull it out ! " She looked up at him , still far off and too weary to weigh his words . " We 'll need some antiseptic .

She pulled upward on the arrow ; no give there . The ambulance tilted as someone climbed onto the driver 's bench . She looked up like a child caught in a forbidden act . " Let your hands be strong ! " White said . " Here ! " He pressed one boot against Templeton 's back , gripped the shaft , and yanked . A rasping sound came from the mattress ; Templeton 's fist twisted and wilted , his fingers unfolded . White looked up , smiling . " Nothing to it . "  |p161U|p  over the tailgate an unhappy Glover climbed . " No antiseptic , " he announced . " We 'll have to . . . " He stopped , seeing the arrow in White 's hand . White wiped the blade on his trousers and laid the arrow on the side bench . Glover began again . " There 's no antiseptic  --  " " Do n't be a fool ! " White reached down and drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he opened it and tilted it over the wound , watching the whisky spill and wash away with all the bitter fascination of a jilted lover . After a moment his trance broke ; he turned the flask up and handed it to Jennie . " He 'll want it when he comes around . " Now a compress . " With your permission , " he said , untying the scarf knotted around her neck . He folded the scarf , thrust it up under the matted shirt , drew his arm out , and clambered off . Still holding the flask upright , she crawled to the end of the ambulance and vomited far down onto the sparse earth . Hard earth and dry , the crust broken and buckled by the heat of the sun , the splinters of shale glinting underneath . Around the tiny fort formed by the wagons , the soldiers tore at the shale with bayonets , frying pans , bare hands , scraping and scooping it up for earthworks . The recruits whimpered as they worked ; the veterans were silent , aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their guts . Wands , in commandnow , moved from side to side of the hollow square , preparing his defenses : to the east four Springfields and one officer with a Henry to cover the long slope they had conquered ; to the north no danger where the bluffs broke sheer to the brown and boiling river ; no danger on the south side either where , close by the corral , the ground crumbled and collapsed seventy feet down into a ravine ;  |p162all  the rest of his strength Wands placed on the west side where the broad ledge sloped down and around and up the rising plain that led south toward Reno . Out there , well out of range , the Indian riders massed now , watching for some signal before they charged . High on a hilltop commanding all the scene Wands saw a lone Indian , a young chieftain in full headdress and war paint , holding a red blanket by his side . Settling in the shallow trenches , the soldiers also watched the young chief . No one spoke . Within the corral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smallest sounds reached Wands : a mule scraping the bare earth for forage ; a flag raised by Terrell snapping in the faint wind ; the distant complaints of killdeer in the marshes across the river ; the clicking of locks as each man raised the hammer of his Springfield and felt for the cap covering the nipple . For one moment of stillness time moved away from Wands as it had moved away on the eve of other battles : a young fox hunting for mice beneath the pines at Manassas ; a hermit thrush singing after sundown in White Oak Swamp . Every sound and movement enlarged in those doomed surroundings ; even a quavering leaf had become ever , lasting as he stood with heightened awareness on the fine edge of life . The red blanket waved high over the chief 's headdress ; the soldiers shouted , the women rushed for shelter . The mules reared and tore at their halters as many arrowsfired by unseen enemies struck downward from the sun . In the distance the cluster of ponies broke up ; in file they raced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon ; the ponies charged riderless down the dip and up along the ridge , faster and more frightening than anyp163Confederate cavalry ; yards away they swerved slightly , the barrels of rifles or bent bows pointed from beneaththeir outstretched necks . The rifles flamed , the arrows tore into earthworks and wagon boards ; the earth shuddered as the Indians swept by with all the force of a flash flood ripping up a dry riverbed . On down the hill they went , the riders swinging back into the saddles , on over the knoll where the dead mules lay , down into the trees , up the far bank and on up behind the hill , completingthe circle . Too stunned to move , the soldiers lay on the earth . Slowly they stirred , testing arms and legs ; a few began to moan and clutch at wounds . From the west trench two soldiers lifted a third , his head lopped over , an arrow driven beneath his collarbone . Through the dust of the corral Wands ran to the west trench , for the blanket was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on the hillside , and already some damned fools were firing . " Hold your fire ! " Wands shouted . " Aim for the horses ' necks ! Lead them by a length ! " Beside him a long barrel pointed ; a baffled recruitwaited , trembling , for a pony to dart across his sights . " Here ! " Wands seized the rifle . Kneeling , he pivoted , his left thumb stretched out along the bayonet band , his right arm level with his chin . Smoothly the barrel moved up to and past a pinto spread out in full gallop , trailing an orange saddle blanket . A full length ahead of the pony Wands squeezed . No explosion ; no cap on the nipple . Damn you ! Wands rose , reaching for his holster . Along the ridge now came the pinto , its jaw yanked sideways by the single rope , its eyes distended , a flat bow bent beneath its neck ; Wands fired at the dappledchest . The pony stumbled , it somersaulted and lay writhing , trying to rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body with two black horns and a buffalo mane for a head , dragged itself off to the cliffside and toppled over . One mounted Indian accounted for ; one out of fifty or more . Twelve such charges they can manage if the men learn to lead . We 're likely to lose a man or two each time . We have n't a chance this way , Wands decided , but what can I do ? I could sleep now , he thought , but if I fell asleep I think I 'd never wake again . He closed his eyes ; he started as someone gripped his forearm  --  Terrell , pointing southward . " There , sir ! " From the ravine a score of arrows soared up into the sun , out of sight there in the blinding light , and down , among the soldiers . From the ravine that I thought was safe . We 're trapped , then ! For one wild moment Wands seized upon the idea of escape : out up the slope there if we make a break for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one or two wagons might . . . No , we have n't a prayer of escaping , he decided . We have n't the mules : and we have the women . Out there we 'd sink like water into sand . Someone , sometime , would find our wagons fired and a few remains . " Give me five men ! " Terrell cried . " It 's our one chance , Lieutenant ! With five men I 'll clear the ravine ! " Five men ? I started with twenty-one , Wands told himself ; seven must be disabled ; that leaves fourteen . Five from fourteen is nine ; nine in all to hold all four sides . . . . " I ca n't ! " he cried . " Three , then ! Give me three and I 'll . . . " Terrell could hardly have pleaded for his own life with greater urgency . Wands shook his head . " I 'll take one , " said White suddenly , close beside them . Before Wands could answer , the Reverend was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of the ravine . A fool I was to let him go ; a fool to choose this place ; a fool to let the detachment ride blindly into that ambush ; everything I 've done all day was wrong . Far down in the ravine a battery of shots sounded . Poor fellow . " I never saw a man so brave . " Terrell sighed . One more shot ; one to finish him , or the boy . Great God , Wands thought , if they 're armed with rifles down there ! The ravine resounded with a long-drawn battle cry . Wands rushed to the south trench and crouched there . " When you see them . . . " Up the distant throat of the ravine a band of Indians scrambled , running away and never looking back . The men in the south trench waited , not daring to hope . After a time they heard sounds of earth falling back down the bank . Wands glanced again at the caps on his revolvers ; the sounds increased ; over the edge a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dug in ; a metal cylinder appeared , the snout of the pepper-box , then the disheveledhead . The Reverend lay on the edge for a moment . Then he stood erect . He walked grinning toward the wagons . I have pursued mine enemies , and overtaken them ; neither did I turn again till they were consumed . Back in the earthworks , the boy panted in triumph . " Went off all at once , the Reverend 's contraption did ! Like to tore that Indian apart ! Took off like scared rabbits , the rest of them , and as they was running I got me another ! " White paid no attention . He studied the hill beyond , where the chief stood , and after a moment he beckoned to Wands . " One branch of the gulley cuts behind him . A man could creep up there now without being seen , and with the Henry . . . Wands nodded . " But not you again ! " At his command two men crawled out from the east trench : an officerp166with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Henry back if the officer should be seen and cornered . The two men watched the young chief , and when he turned away they slid down into the ravine . Wands waited : it seemed impossible ; but the chief showed no awareness that he was being stalked . Twenty minutes later he spun suddenly and fell before they heard the single shot . In the shelter of a wagon lay the wounded , ready for death but unprepared for pain . The pain tightened as the shock eased , it came stabbing as the numbness withdrew . Too weak to fight back , they lay crying out in prayer or profanity until , in the heat of the day , thirst drew its dry sackcloth over flame and faintness and closed its ashen hands around their throats . Their chests heaved , their lips quavered ; their eyes widened in terror as the rifles spattered and in the fierce sunlight the legs of the Indian ponies flashed past . In the darkness beneath the wagon Glover crouched among the wounded . He had found an emergency firstaidkit ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catlins , forceps , needles , silk thread for ligatures , a probe for bullets , a phial of ammonia to revive the wounded , one small flask of brandy , a roll of muslin , and the white strips that Jennie Wands had torn from her sheet/ing . " It 's coming , " he heard her murmur as she stroked the forehead of a young recruit , a carpenter 's bound boy , content at his bench six months before . " It 's coming . " But it 's not , Glover thought ; there 's no way to get to the river . And in all the wagons there 's not a canteen , not a cupful of water . Across the corral more soldiers stumbled , gripping their wounds with charred and grimy hands . Resting against the wagon wheels , they regarded Glover coldly as he worked , and without gratitude , thinking : This is woman 's work ; a man should be handling a gun out there with us . " You the nurse ? " one demanded , standing over him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's massive thigh . The wagon master lowered himself to the ground . He looked on amused as Glover fumbled among the instruments . " You ai n't afraid to pull it ? " he asked . Glover shook his head . " What 's the matter ? You feeling sick ? " Glover said nothing . With his scissors he snipped a cross in the man 's corduroy trousers . " You going to sew that up again ? " " Not today . " Glover turned back the flaps and wiped away the blood . The shaft is too long , too loose , he decided . He whittled it away . " Careful you do n't cut your thumb , " the wagon master muttered . Glover laid down the knife and picked up the forceps . " Hold still . " " You figure I 'm going to run away ? " The sight of it must have unnerved him , Glover thought , for his voice is weaker . The ammonia is therep168in the kit , in case . He gripped the shank with the forceps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blade . The wound , like a crimson and poisonous flower , opened . And it will open further , Glover decided , unless I sew it up . He flushed it out with whisky ; he took a hooked needle and thread . Grinding his teeth , he drew the man 's hide together . White and weak , he looked up at the end , waiting for ridicule , for it was a terrible example of embroidery . The wagon master , just as weak and white , looked at Glover and sighed . From then on a routine emerged for Glover from the broken rhythms of the day . He cut bandages during moments of inaction ; when the ground began to shake and the rifles chattered he moved beneath the wagon to quiet the men who lay there ; then he crawled out to await the procession of wounded men that followed each charge . His sense of mortification diminished as he worked ; impressions formed like flecks in the dust and confusion . Peters spoke of his night conversation with Daniels ; his story heightened Glover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day 's events . Terrell led Glover to look again at himself . " You sorry now you stayed on at Laramie ? " Terrell asked , holding out a torn and blackened forearm . " If you mean am I scared "  --  Glover knotted the strip of sheeting and turned for his scissors  --  " I am ! But if you . . . " He turned back , but Terrell was up and gone . Glover watched him running back to his trench . If you mean , he repeated to himself , would I trade my present position for one of safety , then I would not . I am doing at last what I should have done through the war . I lacked courage then , but I never lacked the opportunity to run away . Now I am better off ; for now I lack both . The rifles broke again into ragged fire . Glover returnedp169to the darkness beneath the wagon . He brushed black ants from the body of one unconscious recruit ; he clasped another boy against his chest . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy murmured as Glover wound a fresh strip of sheeting under his armpit . I know what you mean , Glover thought . My own head throbs ; my face feels as though the crack that is my mouth could split from ear to ear . He laid the boy back on the ground and crawled on . The pad coveringone old soldier 's mouth and chin was darkest at the ragged edges . Glover lifted it ; he looked at the shreds of gum , roots of teeth , splinters of marrow . The jaw widened a little on its hinges . " Uh . . . Uh . . . " I know ; but there is n't any ; and there wo n't be any ; it 's beyond our reach . It would take two men to carry the water up from the river and four to stand guard for them ; and not one man out there can be spared . There will be still fewer to fight now , Glover thought , after this last charge . He crawled out again , in time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dragged between them . An arrow was driven deep into the man 's stomach , beneath the rib cage , close to the peritoneum , the sump . Once the sump is punctured , Glover remembered , the heart will pump on until a man dies in agony , poisoned by his own lifeblood . The two soldiers looked at Glover , appealing , as if it were within his power to arrest what had to come . He shook his head . All I can do , he thought as he led the way beneath the wagon , is to raise his head to stop the blood from choking him . He folded a towel for a pillow , he eased it under the head of the wounded man  --  Terrell . The sergeant 's eyes regarded him for an instant ; then his head thrashed from side to side ; his mouth opened and at once clamped shut , containing the scream ; hisp170back arched and pounded on the earth , driving the shaft deeper . Glover held him down until he weakened . The sweat crept over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold . Glover cut the shaft off short ; he laid his corduroy jacket over the sergeant 's chest and side . It seemed then as if the pain left Terrell in search of other men , for he lay quietly . " You 'll be all right , " Glover said weakly . " You 'll . . . " Terrell shuddered ; his lips moved . " 0 my God . . . ' " He swallowed . " . . . I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee , and I detest my . . . " His effort brought back the pain . " Grip my hand ! " he cried . " Tighter ! . . . Tighter ! " He stared wide-eyed at Glover until the spasm passed . He licked his lips . " You 're not sorry you . . . " " No ; I 'm not sorry . " Terrell closed his eyes and continued the Act of Contrition . " I detest my sins most sincerely . ' " The rest came in rushes :  --  . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Thy . . . amiable perfections . . . firmly purpose . . . holy grace . . . never more . . . ' all I can ; all I . . .  --  His fingers tore from Glover 's grip ; he rolled over , grippinghis stomach . " Ah . . . Ah . . . " His arm scraped the hard earth , searching . The veteran beside them plucked the wad of cotton from his shattered jaw ; he moved his arm blindly until it encountered Terrell 's . Terrell 's hand closed on the wad ; he stuffed it into his mouth . Gasping and gagging , he died . And lay there . The ants , one and then several , venturedover the sergeant 's body , exploring , meeting , seekingand receiving instructions , hurrying on . Glover watched them , too numb to move . Dimly he heard Peters : " It 's just as he said it would be . " Then from the east trench came curses , wilder and more despairing than any Glover had heard through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Down on the far knollp171three Indians moved , dragging a white body  --  Daniels . One Indian held him ; the second fired arrows into his chest and neck ; the third bent over the body with a knife ; a slash parted one thigh , then the other , then the stomach . Glover 's sight narrowed to the ground close beneath him . His ears resounded with the rising clamor of the soldiers . Over all their voices he heard White 's promise of revenge : " . . . life for life , eye for eye , tooth for tooth . . . hand for hand , foot for foot . Burning for burning . . . " The Reverend stopped short , the soldiers glanced up as Glover rushed out among them . He tripped and fell headlong into the trench ; he picked up the two pails he had taken from the wagon ; he scrambled up over the earthworks and rushed on down the slope , his legs akimbo , his arms swinging ; the pails , clanging and banging , drowned out their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What I have said is not an order , " Wands said . " Any man here is free to challenge it . " He looked around the circle gathered within the wagons . " Does any soldier dis-agree ? " None stirred . " Or any civilian ? " Wands added . " Reverend ? " " I agree , " White murmured . The absolute nature ofp172the act appealed to him . Yet he could not comprehend that the righteous should fall . " Mr. Glover ? " Glover nodded , staring westward where the sun burned down among the peaks . They could have riddled me with arrows , he said to himself . There were dozens of them all around me when I tumbled over the bank . Why did n't they kill me ? They were watching me as I dipped the pails in the river ; I could feel the arrows aimed at me even though I did n't dare look up . But not one did they fire ; not as I crouched there without moving ; not when I clambered back up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still unbelieving , for a second load . They spared me  --  to play out some role that neither they nor I understand ? " It 's agreed , then , " Wands said . " No one is to be left alive . One box of cartridges will be held out in my ambulance . My revolvers will be with me . When we are down to three able men , those three will shoot all the survivors . First the women and children , then the wounded , and last of all themselves . " " How long have we got , Lieutenant ? " " I hope until sunrise , " Wands said . " In any case , we 'll mount guard in hourly shifts from dark until dawn . We 'll bury Terrell now . Then we 'll start a fire and see what we can cook for supper . That 's all . " A blue ruff and a yellow button  --  she turned the flower over in her fingers as the group broke up around her . Some rough-bearded soldier pressing a pistol against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't care about myself ; not if you do it ; but he 's only seven . He ca n't hurt the Indians . They love children , Alex ; they even tried to buy Mrs. Fessenden 's baby , back at Sedg/wick ; you remember . They 'll take him if they find him . They 'll care for him and raise him , and one day , even if he does n't know whose child he is and where he comes from , he 'll find his way back . A hand pressed on her shoulder as Wands bent down beside her . " Jennie , why did I ever bring you West ! " She pressed her head against his knee , but he rose quickly and left her . She started up , wanting to run to the ambulance where the boy slept , wanting to clasp him , to take him and hide him . But there 's no place ; and if he sees me as I am now , he 'll know , and that 's the one last thing I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She sank back . " Like this ! " The two soldiers who had lain beneath the ambulance were squatting close by her . And one was undoing his bootlaces . He tied the laces together and made a loop in one end to slip over the trigger . " This way you can do it yourself . " " If I hit myself , it 'll be the first thing I 've hit all day . " " There 's nothing to it . You hold the stock between your boots like this and put the muzzle here , under your chin . You ca n't miss . " " You ca n't , you mean . Aim for my chin with this old piece and , like as not , I 'll blow off my boot ! " But the second soldier rigged up his gun . " Man that is born of woman . . " At White 's somber tones the two soldiers sighed and stood up. " . . . hath but a short time to live and is full of misery . He cometh up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it were a shadow and never continueth in one stay . . . . " The small group gathered by the narrow trench.  | . . . " Who for our sins art justly displeased . . . " White nodded and two men lowered the body into a narrowtrench . . . We therefore commit his body to the ground as earth to earth . . . " The men shoveled the shale back over Terrell 's face and his boots ; over his legs and his bent knees. " . . . looking for the general resurrection in the last day and the life of the world to come through our Lord Jesus Christ at whose coming in Glorious Majesty to judge the world the earth and the sea shall give up their dead . . . . ' " In one hand , still clenched , someone had thrust an empty cartridge case , stuffed with a paper giving his name , his detachment and rank , his home and his religion , the circumstances of his death : killed fighting Indians , July 21 , 1866 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last to be seen of Sergeant Terrell . " Our father who art in heaven . . . ' " the group whispered . At the prayer 's end Mrs. Fessenden began in a lean voice : " Rock of Ages , cleft for me . . . . ' " White lent his deep pitch to the first lines : " Let me hide myself . . . . " He looked around for support , but the hymn was alien to the Negroes and unwelcome to the men . The second verse eked out to a miserable end . A makeshift cross was planted over Terrell 's head . In an eerie dance the men circled , stamping on the earth  --  postponing the time when the wolves would discover its secret . White closed his Bible and motioned that the service was over ; yet no one moved . He looked at the women waiting in silence around him , their features fading as the light ebbed from the plains . He turned to the men  --  from almost every one the whiteness of bandages stood forth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the snowp175peaks , chilled them , and White 's shoulder stiffened and shivered where an arrow had pierced his muscle . The forlorn nature of the little group ; its resignation and despair drained off all but the last of his resolution . With the last , he knew that more must be said , in vindication , for these people staring at the troubled earth were seeing not Terrell but themselves . And White wished to say more ; for the self-abasement of the service seemed sour after the affirmation of the day , and the thought of eternal life did not transcend the bitterness of young lives cut short . No , he told himself , but : The Lord revengeth ; the Lord revengeth , and is furious . " The Lord will take vengeance on his adversaries , ' " White murmured , " ' and he reserveth wrath for his enemies . ' " " Amen , " a colored woman whispered . " ' The Lord is slow to anger , ' " the Reverend intoned , " and great in power , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm , and the clouds are the dust of his feet ! ' " With some spirit the group echoed " Amen ! " White looked up into the dimming sky where the night hawks swerved and slanted on narrow wings ; across to the peaks and north to the valley where , in the lengthening shadows , the Indians were preparing their return at dawn . " ' Behold , 0 mount Seir , ' " he cried out , " I am against thee , and I will stretch out mine hand against thee , and I will make thee most desolate . ' " " Amen ! " they muttered , " Amen ! " " I will make thee perpetual desolations , and thy citiesshall not return : and ye shall know that I am the Lord .  --  " Amen ! " they declared and , seeing that he had finished , moved about , nodding and saying Well , whoknows , and We 're not done yet . No , sir , not by any means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wands had spoken burst from him . " Give me the stallion , Lieutenant , " he cried , " and a boy to ride cover , and I 'll get to Reno ! " An idea that Wands had considered many times in the course of the day and set aside . Three hours to get there even if you kill the horses ; an hour to make ready ; nine hours for the men to reach us if they hurry . It made no sense in daylight , for the riders could not have broken through that cordon on the hillside . And it makes less sense now , for even if they do get through , darkness will cost them another two hours or so . And by the time . . . But the women were crying out in praise of White , and even the men were declaring He can make it if anyone can and moving off to tighten the girths on the horses . Why deprive them of one last hope when it gives them strength ? For they need some source of strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against his betterjudgment , nodded assent . The stallion was led out from the cluster of passive animals ; a young volunteer was armed ; five men hoisted White and the boy into the saddles ; lashing the horses , they galloped off . They rounded the low ground , they turned onto the long rise toward Reno . A dozen Indians rushed out , yelling and kicking their ponies . Then the pursuers and the pursued vanished into the dusk , and the cries of the Indians drifted off on the western wind . Nothing more ; the men and women who had cheered White on his way turned back , their sudden elation gone as it had come . Without speaking , for there was no more to say , they went about the chores of the evening . A wounded mule was shot and sliced for meat . On the earth close by the grave a small fire began to crackle and glow . The first guard mount took their positions inp177the trenches , peering outward where all forms blurred and softened . The rest huddled around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing  --  until one of the horses neighed . On the north side the sentry was alert . " Look there ! " He pointed as Wands settled beside him . On the horizon , between the dim shades of the hills , Wands saw at last a curious film , lighter than the hills . It 's dust , he decided , raised by the reinforcements that the Indians have been waiting for . If they 're mounted , then within an hour . . . Still , he remembered , the Indians shun night attacks  --  something about the dark . He lay watchingthe dust . I 'll let the men rest , he told himself , for as long as they can . I 'll say nothing until the time comes . From the western trench a low whistle sounded : the sentry 's call . " Something out there , " the sentry whispered as Wands crawled into the trench . And this man was a veteran , used to night sounds . They waited , seeing nothing , hearing only a wolf 's howl high in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It wound down . They waited , tense in the hush . A half-mile out , where the Indians had hidden , a flock of killdeer rose with bitter cries . And the horse neighed again . " Call the men , " Wands whispered . The sentry crept out . Wands , lying alone , felt with his forefingers the caps of his revolvers . On the rim of hills that curved around from the ledge something moved in the last light : a horse ; a lone horse and rider . An Indian ? I do n't think so . A decoy ? Without a whisper the last of the soldiers , the unwounded , took their places in the trench . They rubbed their elbows into the earthworks ; the hammers of their rifles clicked back ready to strike ; the long barrels pointed outward , bearing on the solitary object : an old horse  --  a bony horse picking its cautious way to the ridge , clear within each gunsightp178by now . Yet something about the rider 's bent shoulders . . . " Hold your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse was fifty yards off he called out : " Halt ! " The horse stopped ; unconcerned , the rider waited . " Who goes there ? " Wands cried out . A thin voice answered : " Friend ! " " Come in ! " Wands called . The horse moved forward again at its same weary pace : up the slope and into the farthest reach of the firelight , its eyes gleaming , its nostrils wide , its gaunt head stretched out from a spindly neck ; a gray mare ; an ancient flea-bitten mare . On her sagging back an old man rode , a weather-beaten man who smiled as he saw the battery of rifles arraigned against him . " That 's a powerful lot of rifles to take care of one old trapper , " he said . He slid off the mare 's back , a tall man in the firelight , rawboned and blue-eyed , with gray hair tufting out from under a tattered hat and gray stubble on his hollow cheeks , dressed in a deerskin jacket and smelling of wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooking . He started toward the fire , loosening his homemadecartridge belt . Wands checked him . " Who are you ? " " Why , Jim Bridger , " the old man said , surprised , as if everyone knew that . " Are you alone ? " " At night ? In Sioux country ? " Bridger chuckled . " There 's two hundred soldiers heading this way in the valley . Should be here in half an hour if that fool captain does n't turn around again . " " They sent you to relieve us , " a soldier cried . " They knew we  --  "  | " Rah ! " Bridger looked out to the night and the north . " That son of a gun would be at Clear Fork yet if I had n't driven him crazy ! Pestered him all day , I did , until he gave up and double-timed his men down the trail . " " You knew , then ! " " I should ! " He looked longingly toward the meat . " How did you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read it , " he declared , as if that was as obvious as his name . He moved in toward the fire . " But . . . " Bridger laid his hand on the man 's shoulder . " You 're going to tell me I ca n't read nor write ! As if I do n't know it ! But I can read Indian signs . Hell , " he added , " every buffalo skull from here to the fort said Big battle at Crazy Woman 's ; many whites to be killed . But you think that damn fool captain would believe it ? Just a lot of drawings , ' he said . Nothing but drawings ! ' Be at Clear Fork yet if I had n't pestered him . " He stood over the fire , warming his hands and wrinklinghis nose . " Mule meat , " he said with pleasure . " Mule meat ! Next to panther meat and dog meat , there 's nothingnourishes a man more than a nice strip of mule meat . " He sniffed hungrily , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . From the women there rose cries of thankfulness and praise . " Our prayers , our prayers are answered ! Almighty God heard us ! He answered our prayers ! " " Maybe so , " Bridger said , grinning . " Maybe so . But I reckon it 's just as well for the Almighty that an old squaw taught me how to read . "  |p180His  heels resounded ; his right forefinger thudded against his forehead in a smart salute . " Sir , Lieutenant Wands , Alexander Hamilton , Eighteenth U.S. Infantry , reportingas ordered ! " He handed across the table the papers that he carried : the orders transferring his detachment from Sedgwick , the muster rolls of the men , and the packet of telegrams and dispatches from Laramie . " Sit down , " Carrington said . " You 've had a difficult time . " " A little . " " We tried to warn you . We sent a courier to stop you . Why he failed to reach you in time . . . ' " He was killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Carrington shuddered . " That 's the second courier we 've lost . And yet I 'm charged with maintaining a mail service that would do justice to Boston or New York ! Wands , sometimes I . . . " He started to rise ; he sat down again and picked at the ribbon that bound the packet of dispatches . " Tell me what happened , " he said . " We were ambushed , " Wands began , " caught in the worst possible place . " He described the battle , and as he spoke Carrington opened and glanced at the first of the dispatches . He studied it , shaking his head . He seemed so far distant that at last Wands gave up and waited.  |p181Carrington  became aware of the silence . " How many were you , " he demanded . " Thirty-three  --  including the women and children . " " You should never have started ! You should have known ! " " We had no way of knowing . We were told that everything was peaceful along the Powder River . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here . " He flicked across the table the neatly folded sheet . " You 're entitled to read the dispatch that you struggled so hard to bring . " The message was written with bold flourishes : I have the honor to state to you that a satisfactory treaty has been concluded with the Brule and Ogallalabands of Sioux Indians . SgdR . N. McLaren Resdt Pro Tem " They told us the same story , " Wands said . " Of course ! And they will tell it to the President ! And the President will tell it to the Congress and to the country . And the Congress and the country will believe it because that is what they want to believe . God knows I wish it were the truth ! And it might be the truth , " Carringtoncried , rising , " it could be the truth if they would give me the men and the arms to conclude and enforce a just peace ! I pleaded for more men with Stanton . I . . . " At the door of the tent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heave a hewn timber into place in the stockade . " You survived one day 's encounter , " he said , returning to his table . " There are others . " He shuffled throughp182his papers . " On June 30 , " he read , " the Sioux ran off thirty-three head of livestock and mules at Reno . On July 17 they raided the picket lines here , and stampeded the herd . A recruit rode after them over Lodge Trail Ridge , a boy by the name of Livelsberger . . . . " He winced . " He was still alive when we found him two days later . On July 22 , " he continued , " the Sioux attacked a party of emigrants north of here . On July 23 they attackedanother train to the south of the fort . On July 25 . . . " He looked up . " It 's co-ordinated , Lieutenant ; it 's planned , and not by the Indians alone . There 's a white renegade with them , a Confederate , one of Morgan 's Raiders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; his name is Bob North . Do n't misunderstand me , " he cried , seeing Wands 's expression . " I am not despairing . But I must have reinforcements ! I spoke with the greatest urgency to Sherman at Kearney . He thought it not unlikely that the Second Infantry would be sent to me from Louisville . . . . You did n't hear anything , by any chance ? " " I heard nothing . " Carrington bit his lip and unfolded the second dispatch . " Fetterman is at Sedgwick , " Wands added . " I know that he is impatient to . . . What is it ? " he asked , seeingthe anguish in the Colonel 's face . " There are two indispensable men in my command , " Carrington cried . " Phisterer and Bridger . And now Phisterer is transferred to the Thirty-sixth ! " In a distractedmanner he tore open the rest of the dispatches . As he scanned the last he smiled stiffly , as one does after a defeat . " What do you remember of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He was Irish , " Wands said , " and notoriousfor his bravery under fire . " " Fighting Phil . . . " Carrington motioned to Wands to complete his report . He took notes on the tactics of the Indians ; he inquired after the wounded ; he trembled , closing his eyes as Wands described the disfigurement of Daniels ; he nodded gratefully at the lieutenant 's tribute to the Reverend White for his night ride to Reno , no less gallant because it proved to be unnecessary . When Wands had finished , the Colonel asked : " Could Bridger establish what tribes participated in the attack ? " " He identified the arrows as Brule and Ogallala ; and some he said were made and traded by the other bands of the Sioux . " " Then there were no Cheyennes ? I 'm glad at least for that . It means that Black Horse kept his promise to me . " Wands remembered the old chief , moving southwest with his ragged herd of humans . " Black Horse passed us on the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent in a messenger holding up a paper that you had given him saying that he had shaken hands with you and must be treated kindly . " Wands did not add that the messenger had , with equal solemnity , produced a second paper , a receipt from Kinney for a quart of whisky , on which was scrawled , in Brown 's handwriting : Any fool who is stupid enough to believe this lying old traitor deserves to lose his scalp . " When Black Horse left me , " Carrington said , " the Sioux caught him and questioned him . He told them I had come to make peace . They demanded that he join them in war against me , and when he refused they unslung their bows and whipped him and all his chiefs across their backs and their faces . "  |p184Carrington  sighed . " I am instructed to destroy my enemies , and I have not the strength to protect my friends . " He looked up at Wands : " Responsibility , Lieutenant , final responsibility , is a burden that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bear . " " I understand , " Wands said . " Do you ? I thought I understood when I assumed command of the regiment at Chattanooga . I had , after all , held positions of far greater authority in Ohio ; I had moved far larger numbers of troops . And yet I had not understood , for there was always someone behind me or beside me . " I always admired Mr. Lincoln , " Carrington added . " Now I know what he endured , living alone in the White House and bearing all the weight of suffering , North and South . I understand now why Sherman lost his sanity for a time . I even begin to realize why Grant . . . " He paused . " It seems to me now , " he said , " that no man who has not borne final responsibility can understand how lonely and oppressed the man who bears it must be . " " I bore it at Crazy Woman 's , " Wands said . " I aged ten years in the course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recollect what the lieutenant had just said . Never mind ; he rose and led the lieutenant out . As they moved into the sunlight where the soldiers toiled , his bearing stiffened . " Your wife was not too upset by her experience ? " " Far from it . " " Good ! Mrs. Carrington is expecting both of you for dinner at seven thirty . After dinner we may play a little whist or the Authors game if Mrs. Wands is not too tired . "  | " My wife will be delighted . " " You will understand if I excuse myself for a time . I make it a rule to inspect each sentry post during the evening . " " Of course . " Carrington gripped Wands 's hand . " Welcome to Fort Phil Kearny ! " His heels resounded , his right arm rose smartly . " Sir . . . " Ten Eyck lay sprawled on the table before him in stupor or in sleep . " Lieutenant Wands , Alexander Hamilton . . . " Beneath the post commander 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black shepherd , stretched out by Ten Eyck 's boots , and , pillowed in its crotch , a black-and-tan dachshund . . . Eighteenth U.S. Infantry , reports to . . . " Ten Eyck sighed or snored . The shepherd regarded Wands with one amber eye . It also sighed and stretched . Sloughed off , the dachshund padded over to Wands and sniffed him in a routine inspection . Satisfied , it lifted a hind leg against his trouser , thought better of it , scratched the ground twice , and padded back under the table . There it busied itself in poking its rat 's nose under the shepherd 's tail. . . to the post commander . . . " Wands murmured.  |p186Ten  Eyck grimaced at some unpleasant taste or some image in a dream . He licked his broad lips , his mouth fell agape ; he slept on . Beneath the table the shepherd bared its fangs and , arching upward , gripped the dachshund 's head . The dachshund disengaged and presented in place of its head its rear and underside . Dutifullythe shepherd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a wistful and far-off way . See something strange , I raise this flag and hold it steady . And hope someone is watching me down there in the fort . If it 's Indians , then I raise it again and wave it from right to left  --  or left to right , is it ? No , right to left ; three times . And hope they do n't head for me . Wait three minutes , the sergeant told me , and then repeat the signal . A lot of ground they can cover in three minutes . If they come for you , then wait and watch the hillside . But if they come along the hillside , between me and the fort ? Run when you see them , O'Gara said , and to hell with waiting ; we got our fill of bloody heroes in the Eighteenth , he said , without you . Leaning on the north wall of the blockhouse , Gibson looked down the ribs of the ridge , across the valley where the white tents stood in rows , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hills where a second blockhouseperched at his own height , three miles away . Colo/nel sure placed them smartly , he thought . I can see south clean over the lake ; he can see north up to Lodge Trail Ridge . Between us we cover the whole valley up to the mountains . Damn if a dozen Indians can come down but what we spot them . They 're north of here , anyway ; if they do come , then he 's the one to catch it , not me . Nonetheless , Gibson crossed to the south wall of the blockhouse and peered downward . A bunch of buffaloes cropped the valley grass far under him ; would n't be cropping so peaceful if there were Indians near . Beyond the next ridge lay the blue surface of Lake de Smet . A flight of wild ducks rose there and circled and settled in the early evening . Nothing else stirred . Hell , he decided , I 'm as safe and snug here as a woodchuck in a burrow . He lay down between the open walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buff-colored clouds slide overhead ; and dreamed of home . And was not aware when a lean figure moved through the doorway and stood over him . Bloody idiot , thought O'Gara , he does n't even pretend to be awake ! I ought to scare the piss out of him , but then he 's just stupid enough to grab his rifle and fire without looking . And guard duty 's the only chance a soldier gets to sleep these days . He sat down , hot and huffing after the hard trudge up the hill . " A terrible distance a man has to go to have a drop in private , " he said as he pulled out his flask . And when Gibson still failed to wake , he shouted : " I said it 's a hell of a bloody climb ! " He eyed the Springfield as Gibson sprang up . Gibson was offended . To hide his humiliation , he took the flask from O'Gara and gulped up a mouthful of whisky . If it was so far , then what had O'Gara come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So I would n't have to share my potheen , " O'Gara saidp188sourly . " Watch it ! " he cried in alarm as the boy coughed and sputtered . " That 's good whisky you 're wasting ! " Gibson wiped his eyes on his sleeve and blurted out in his tactless way that the whisky was half his anyway , what with all the money O'Gara had borrowed from him . And just to prove he could , he took the flask again and drank , slowly and steadily , until O'Gara cried : " Easy ! " and took the flask back . " Mind the Colonel does n't catch you , " O'Gara added , for whisky was precious . But Gibson only smiled and said he reckoned the Colonel would n't hurt a fly . The boy 's learning , thought O'Gara , and he retreated to a secondary defense . " Terrible what that whisky cost me , " he declared . " It 's that devil : that limb of the devil ! Him with his fine clothes and his soft gab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at the flask , for his thirst was no less . He knew that he ought to know who , but he did n't know who . So he said : " Who ? " " Who else but Kinney ? Robbing the soldiers , and they fighting and dying for their country . " Ah , the shame of it , thought O'Gara ; the injustice of it ! " Five dollars he wants for a  --  " Gibson interrupted , saying that the sutler had always been kind enough to him . " Gives me a soda for nothing , " he affirmed , " when there 's no one else in his store . And said if I 'd come round to his tent one evening he 'd give me candy as well . " " Do n't go , boy ! " " Why not , if it 's free ! " " Because I said so . That 's enough , now ! " " I do n't see if I . . . " There 's a lot you do n't see yet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall to wall , staring down intop189the lowlands . Not a bloody redskin moving for twenty miles around . And , more important , no sergeant of the guard either . He sat down again and took the flask from Gibson . " I 'll tell you , now , " he said , back in ' 56 there was a sergeant at Fort Riley by the name of Warren . A buckeen he was , and his wife was another when the whisky was on her . The rest of the time they were doves together , and she in with the officers ' wives as thick as you please . Washed their clothes , she did , and laced their stays and delivered their babies . Ran the post , the Warrens did , until the cholera came and took off the sergeant one week and his wife the next . A great burial service the Colonel called for , and all the ladies of Riley came down where she was lying to dress her in her Sunday best . " You know what happened ? " he demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flask . " They unlaced her corset and there was her chest as hard and hairy as a boar 's hide . And they stripped her on down and there was a cock as big as a kippeen and bollocks like a buffalo 's . " O'Gara sighed on behalf of all the deceived and drew a long drain on the flask . Beside him , Gibson lay back and watched the clouds . O'Gara 's story , though he came at it several ways , made no sense at all . He retained only a sense of resentment at being deprived of the candy , and for no reason . The resentment roiled around within him and then , with a shove from the whisky , rose and declared itself . " You been in the Army ten years , " he said . His voice , his own voice came to him from far off , and he was surprised and pleased at how clear the words sounded . " Why did n't you make sergeant ? " he said . The question appalled O'Gara . And after all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't give them the satisfaction ! " he cried hoarsely . " I 'd go to the guardhouse and sleep on boards first ! " " That 's the Irish , " said the whisky , speaking for Gibson , " always the same . " " And where would America be without the Irish ? " O'Gara demanded . " Where would Sherman be ; or Grant ? " Or Jeff Davis , for that matter , he thought . But there 's no purpose in bedeviling the boy 's mind , he 's simple as it is . " Fight other men 's wars , the Irish do , " O'Gara said after a time , " and damn the thanks they get . " " Why do they fight , then ? " Gibson said lightly . He seemed to be spinning around on the snout of the earth . " I 'll tell you , " O'Gara said . " The graybacks had their homes to fight for , and their niggers , and the Yankees had their Union . But ten of them were never the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second pair of shoes to call his own . " Gibson had not heard that the immigrants won the war . " You never heard of the Twenty-eighth Massachusetts , I suppose ! " O'Gara cried . " Nor the Sixty-third New York ; nor the Eighty-eighth ! You never knew that this very Eighteenth Infantry was one half Irish-born ! " No , Gibson had never known that . O'Gara drew on the flask again . And after a time he said : " Did you never hear of Marye 's Hill ? " No , he never did , said Gibson , lying there with his eyes closed . " It was at Fredericksburg , " O'Gara said , " and there entrenched on the heights above the town was all the Army of Northern Virginia . And in their very center were Cobb and his Irishmen , holding Marye 's Hill . " Hep191glanced at Gibson . " Are you listening or not ? " he demanded ; Gibson murmured assent . " The hill was the point to take , " O'Gara said . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else face defeat . First of all he sent out the Third Division against it . Fine soldiers they were , and eager for victory . They crossed the fields by the river and planted three banners at the foot of Marye 's Hill . And there the Irish met them and turned them back . They left twelve hundred lying there , dead . " He regarded in silence the mouthpiece of the flask . A hiccup bubbled up Gibson 's throat and escaped into the mild air . " Meade was wild , so the story goes , " O'Gara said , " for he knew it was hopeless . But Burnside , that great idiot , drove him on . So he ordered the First Division out . And the First raised its banners , as fresh as the Third and twice as proud . They crossed among the same fields , jumping over the bodies lying there and yelling their throats out . But Cobb and his boys were ready for them . And they met them with a terrible fire , and before the First had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were beaten . " A second hiccup rose into Gibson 's mouth . Scare myself to get rid of it , he thought ; but there 's nothing to be scared of up here . " Down there , in the ravine , would you believe it , was Meagher and his Irish Brigade . And when the First came back beaten , they stepped forward for the charge . Meade was heartbroken , they say , for he knew it was to their deaths they were going , and for nothing . And they were his very best . There was no more than twelve hundred of them when Meagher called them together . But he bade them deck their caps with sprigs of evergreenp192to remind them of the old country . And when the bugle blew , every last one of them laid down his haversack and blanket and set forth as bold as heroes . " And when Cobb 's men saw them coming , a terrible groan swept over them . For they saw those green sprigs and they knew that this time it was blood of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high on Marye 's Hill beside the Confederate colors they lifted their own green flag . And when Meagher 's boys looked up and saw the green above them they cried out for the pity of it . But neither side could give way . So the one flag waved on the hill and there , crossing the fields towards it , was the same dear flag far ahead of the scarlet and blue . The artillery tore into them , and the round shot and the musket fire , and they went down like corn under the sickle , but they passed the three colors and came to the hill , and there by a stone wall they met and brother killed brother . " " The same as everywhere else , " Gibson said faintly . " Ah , worse ! For the Irish are an old race and a small race , and when one dies young there 's none to take his place . There were many hundreds fell that day among Cobb 's men , " O'Gara added after a time , " and many more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hillside . Of all the twelve hundred only a handful came back from Marye 's Hill . " He looked down at Gibson , but the boy slumbered and O'Gara was left to mourn alone . I ought to stand up , he thought ; I ought to look around this bloody blockhouse ; but I 'll finish the flask off first . So he drank on alone . And when the flask was finished , it seemed an idle and a useless thing to stand there looking down on the barren and lonely plain . He stared instead at the empty flask in his hand . And he saw in the metal the fading image ofp193his beloved . Ah , Kate achora , it 's as far as the salt sea you are from me now ; and I melancholic without you . Sure , if I 'm killed and cut open by these heathens , it 's your name they 'll find engraved on my heart . O'Gara sniffed and wiped his nose ; he leaned back against the stone and in a moment he too lay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he rode up with the sergeant of the guard . The presence of the sergeant left the Colonel no choice . He led Gibson back a prisoner charged with an offense which carried the penalty of death . Phisterer pointed to the heading Post return of post as he pushed the wide sheet across the table to Wands . " Write : Fort Philip Kearny D.T. ' " He observed the carefreehandwriting , so unlike his own . " Commanded by , ' write : Captain Tenedore Ten Eyck comma Captain . . " The pen halted . " I 've wanted to ask you about him , " Wands said . " For example , when I reported . . . " " . . . Captain 18th U.S. Infantry . ' " " When I reported to him for duty , he was asleep . " " And drunk , no doubt , " Phisterer said . " During duty hours . " " And also drugged . The Date ' is of course July 1866. ' do n't see . . .  | " You are new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should know the story . " Captain Ten Eyck , " he explained , " surrendered with his company at Mumfordsville and again at Chickamauga . The first time he was returned on parole . The second time he was sent to Libby . He contracted chronic diarrhea and hemorrhoids in prison . He has never recovered . So he drinks to dull the pain in his intestines . " That at least , reflected Phisterer , is his story : every man has his own excuse to explain his drunkenness  --  including my Uncle Ludwig . " Your Uncle Ludwig will support you , " my mother told me when she and her new husband refused to give me more than my passage money on the Anna Delius . " Your Uncle Ludwig will employyou in his fabrik in New Jersey . " I believed her ; I begged my way through New Jersey and three other states hunting for the great industrialist until I found my Uncle Ludwig beso f f en in a bar . And he tried to borrow five pfennigs from me for one last round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid down his pen . " That 's a court-martial offense , carrying dishonorable discharge . And Ten Eyck is post commander . " Phisterer nodded . It was my Uncle Ludwig , he reflected , who taught me to respect the power of whisky . For two years I would not touch a drop . But when I was a private in the Nez Perce campaign and the roll call was taken for the whisky ration , I was ashamed not to ask for mine . So I stepped up to the counter when my name was called , and laid down my twenty-five cents , and swallowed my gill . Then I rushed for the water barrelto put the fire out in my throat . " Subheading : Enlisted men ,  --  he dictated . " Sub-subheading : For duty . ' For Company A , seventy-seven ' ; for Company C , fifty-seven ' ; for Company H , sixty-four. - p195Wands copied the numbers . And as he copied heasked : " Why does n't the Colonel replace him ? " " Sub-subheading : On extra or special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ten Eyck . " " Because the next officer in line is Captain Brown . " " Well ? " " ' Nine ; seventeen ; eight . ' " Phisterer waited for the strokes of the pen . " You should know that story , too , " he said wearily . " Captain Brown consumes two bottles of whisky to Captain Ten Eyck 's one . Furthermore , he believes in making war on the Indians . He is popular with the men . And he is not so easily controlled . " " Colonel Carrington commands the regiment and the District . Surely he  --  " " Sub-subheading : In arrest or confinement . ' For A Company , zero ' ; for C Company , one . ' " " The boy , " Wands said . " What are the charges ? " " Asleep and drunk on duty . " " What will be done ? " " I know what should be done . He should be courtmartialedand then shot . " " When does the board convene ? " " It is delayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court-martial . " " His authority ? As commander  --  " " It is a heavy responsibility , to condemn a man to death . " " The company officers take it . " " Yes , they take it . And if the Colonel . . . " Phisterer paused and gathered up the smaller sheets containing the company returns . " If the Colonel thwarts them , then for their own protection they will reach around him . They will weaken him with his superiors . "  | " How ? I do n't see any  --  " " The mail still goes . " Phisterer was sorting out the company returns . " Heading : Absent , ' " he said , " Subheading : Commissioned officers ' ; sub-subheading : On detached service ' ; for Company A , enter one . ' " A bold stroke . Wands said : " Fetterman ! " " Yes , Fetterman . " Wands laid down the pen . " Why would n't he be the rightful replacement for Ten Eyck ? " " He would be . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Phisterer shook his head . He read on down the Present and absent heading under Enlisted men . " For A Company , enter two , ' " he said . " We carry them as Absent . ' " " Carry who ? " " Gilchrist and Johnson , two of our old soldiers . They were lariated from their horses by Indians on their way back from the hayfields . And since they were alive when last seen we carry them for this month only as Absent . ' " In next month 's return , " he added , " you can list them under Died , wounds in action . ' " " You think they are dead ? " " I hope they are . " Phisterer read on through the Presentand absent heading with all its sub-subheadings down to Artificers , farriers and blacksmiths . Wands filled in the entries , turned over the sheet , and completed the form . " Get the captain to sign it when you can , " Phisterersaid . He leaned back . " Now my official duties are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was busy countersigning thepost return , and the distant tone of his inquiry toldPhisterer that the ranks of the Second Battalion hadclosed behind him . He sensed once more the apartnessp197that he had felt on setting out from Bremen for the New World . My mother told me that only criminals and swindlers go to America , he remembered . But I knew better . I had read The Adventures of Captain Bonneville , and Irving 's Astoria , and all the Leather-Stocking Tales . And I believed in them , as the photographer Glover does still . He looked up , aware that Wands had asked him some half-hearted question ; something about feeling sorry to be leaving . " I am a soldier , " he said . Wands nodded without hearing . As he blotted his signature , he asked : " Will you be long at your new post ? " " At Camp Douglas ? I doubt it . " As he spoke , a second , deeper sense of isolation gripped Phisterer ; the soldierly detachment that had been his pride extended to soldiering . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished to see no further . I shall not be the same in the ThirtysixthInfantry . I fought well in my time , he thought ; I did as much to save the Union as Von Borcke did to destroy it . But that time is over . Leading my company against the Confederateswas my profession . Killing Indians armed with bows and arrows lacks interest . Even the execution of the boy that seemed so necessary matters no longer to me . I am altered now , he thought . I may even turn to some profession other than soldiering when my tour of duty at Douglas is over . But what profession ? Smiling , he remembered the year-end letter he had written at eleven to his teacher . Again a year has passed , it began , and the teacher looked over his spectacles and said : Fritz , you should become a minister or at the very leastp198an ambassador . " No , not an ambassador ; but perhaps a historian . I wish to leave some record to be found in libraries when I am gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want belongings , after twelve years of living with a foot-locker . I want brick walls around me instead of canvas . I want a wife to share all I have , and a son to prolong my line , and daughtersto fuss over me ; to play Schubert to me in the eveningswhen my sight fails . And neighbors polite enough to sit and listen while I enlarge upon the glory of my Army days . " The Colonel will miss you , " Wands said politely as he folded and refolded the post return . " I am afraid so . " " I shall try to take your place , " Wands said , rising from the table . " Yes , you must . " An impulse to reclaim for one moment the status he had loved and lost led Phisterer to delay Wands . He murmured : " You asked many times about the Colonel . " Wands waited at the door of the tent . " I would say this much . . . . " Phisterer faltered , aware that Wands was impatient . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I realize that . " " He is a leading authority on the campaigns of George Washington . He knows his Jomini by heart . " Wands waited , frowning . " He has made a great study of Caesar and of the Greeks  --  in particular , of Xenophon . I think perhaps he sees himself as . . . " Phisterer shook his head , realizing that it was too late . By the west wall of the stockade Phisterer had built a miniature farmyard to house the livestock that hadp199accompanied him West : the brindled cow that had ploddedseven hundred miles roped to his ambulance ; its calf that the Indians had stolen and later surrendered ; the five turkeys and the nineteen chickens that had survived the heat and the pot ; the two piglets whose accidentaldisappearance O'Gara had plotted so cunningly . " Well , they fetched a good price , " he said . He handed the list of purchasers to his orderly . " The pigs to Mrs. Horton ; the cow and calf to the Reverend White , and so on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil . " Servus ! " This is the way I would have it , he thought as he set out around the parade ground to complete his farewells : the heat of the day diminished ; the garrison quiet after recall . A few soldiers crossed between the barracks ; two ladies moved among the croquet hoops he had laid out ; two more , Jennie Wands and Mrs. Horton , passed him speaking in atrocious French  --  Katharine and Alice , he remembered , rehearsing their scene from Shakespeare in preparation for the visit of General Hazen . A cut above the days when I played the Spectre Bridegroom opposite Miss Lulu Sweet . At Ten Eyck 's tent the orderly waved him on ; the post commander was asleep . Good ! Phisterer thought ; I am spared that ! At Adair 's tent the lieutenant sat cleaning his revolvers while the photographer gathered charcoal from a soft-wood fire . They stood up and shook hands with Phisterer and went back to their work . As Phisterer approachedBisbee 's tent he could hear the usual bitter argument : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Why indeed ! If I had known , I would have stayed on with the child in Baltimore ! " Phisterer paused ; he considered passingby the tent ; he remembered that when the color bearer had fallen at the most desperate moment atp200Stone 's River it was Bisbee to whom he had handed the flag , and Bisbee who had carried it forward against the enemy fire . Yes , and Bisbee who led his company across the open field at Jonesboro . He rapped on the tent pole and stepped inside . He did not look at the woman ; her face he supposed was made ugly by crying . Bisbee led him out again and , as they shook hands , pressed upon him an envelope : To be delivered in person to Major van Voast . Reluctantly Phisterer accepted the envelope . " Is it right ? " he asked . " Is not the Colonel entitled to the loyaltyof his officers ? " " My loyalty is to the regiment , " Bisbee said . " And what I do is for the regiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped the envelope into his pocket and walked on to the Colonel 's tent . Margaret Carrington was reading to the boys at bedtime . Phisterer coughed and she came out and stood stiffly in the dim light . " We shall miss you on Sunday mornings , " she said . " You will sing in tune , at least , when I am gone . " " We can never thank you for all that you did for theColonel . " " It has been my pleasure to serve him . " Carrington came out and stood at her side . He fidgeted ; he inquired into a few inconsequential details concerning the journey south . But when Phisterer drew himself up to salute , the Colonel brought out a leather volume : the Anabasis . " I bought it in Heidelberg , " Carringtonsaid . " I have carried it with me ever since . I thought . . . since we both . . . " Phisterer looked up from the Greek text and saw , to his embarrassment , that the Colonel was weeping . I am tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p201it  is tiring to break the bridges . It is a good thing that the officers are too tired to stage a farewell celebration tonight . He stretched out on his cot . He closed his eyes and dreamed . He dreamed that he sat in his father 's lap in the gardens at Stuttgart , listening to the municipal orchestraplaying the Rosamunde music . He lay between sleeping and waking , borne along on the melody . He awoke , and heard to his bewilderment the melody flowingon . At the doorway of the tent Schubert stood with his back to Phisterer , holding one finger to his lips . Beyond him the musicians smiled in the lamplight as they snuggledagainst their violins . Phisterer was touched : he carried a chair out and sat among the musicians , smoking his pipe and seeing again the scenes of his youth . The musicians played A Calm Sea and a Prosperous Voyage and , to end the serenade , " Ein ' Feste Burg . " Then , at Phisterer 's invitation , they trooped inside the tent . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pilsener and three bottles of Golden Wedding that Schubert had laid away . The glasses were raised , and " Trinken , sang Anakreon , " some one began . " Trinken , sang Horaz ! " the rest cried . They sang next " Die lust'gen Musikanten " and " Was Kommt dort von der Hoh " ; and later " Die Alte , " and later still , when all distinctions between officer and enlisted men were washed away , Mozart 's solemn canon " Lech mein Arsch fein . " And when the keg was empty and the bottleswere dry , all the men locked elbows and , swaying , ended with " Oh alte Burschenherrlichkeit . " So they went out laughing into the night . " Oh gute Zeit , oh gute Zeit ! " Phisterer flopped upon his cot and reached down to unlace his boots . He felt something hard ; he lifted one buttock , he drew out ap202book , a little leather volume . He stared at it for a momentwithout comprehension . Then he remembered : the Colonel , the Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! It was only this afternoon that I was saying , was saying to that fellow Wands , that the Colonel sees himself . . . " Oh schlimme Zeit . . . . . as Xenophon , the talented amateur , raised over the professional soldiers , then and forever after . " Oh schlimme Zeit ! " Yes , the Colonel sees himself as Xenophon . But he is not ; no , is not ! He is the other one , the well-meaning one . Phisterer slurred over the pages with clumsy fingers until he came to the story of the Five Generals . Not Clearchus  --  he used to compare me to Clearchus . And not Menon , not that verrceterl This , this is the one . . . Proxenus the Boeotian ; the one who wanted from boyhood to achieve renown . He was indeed able to command orderly and well disposed battalions , but he could not inspire ordinarysoldiers with respect or fear , for he stood more in awe of them than they of him . Phisterer looked out and saw in the ghostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the windy plains of Tarsus , surrounded by the barbarian hordes , and far from home . " Oh schlimme Zeit ! " He turned back to Proxenus : He thought it sufficient to praise him who did well and to withhold praise from an offender . Therefore those of his lieutenants who were honorable and virtuous were greatly attached to him . But the unprincipledplotted against him , for he was easily deceived . He was about thirty years old when he was put to death.  | " Formidable ! " General Hazen cried . He thrust his considerableweight against the timbers of the stockade ; he found no give there . " Impregnable , by God ! " " It should be , " Carrington shouted over the din of spades and sledge hammers . " Every log is sixteen inches in diameter and eleven feet high , hewn on both sides and tamped three feet into hard gravel . " " And sharpened at the top , " Hazen cried , " in case the redskins try to climb over . " " They can not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " we 've cut a space between every fourth and fifth post . They flare outward so that a rifle can be aimed left or right . We reach them by ladders for the moment , but I plan a continuous banquette so that one soldier can fire while the other steps aside and reloads . " It 's necessary , " he added , glancing at the inspector , " because we are still armed with Springfields . " Hazen was looking up and down the eight hundred feet of wall , multiplying by four and dividing . " There must be two thousand logs in place ! " " There will be close to four thousand when the partitionand the blockhouses are built . " Hazen wrote two entries in his notebook . Design , superior . Execution , superior . " Colonel , " he declared , " your plans and your progress deserve the highest possible commendation. "  |p204Carrington  nodded gratefully . " There is not a citizen mechanic at work here , " he said , " and yet our work meets the highest professional standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's trainingand background , " he explained as Hazen wrote . " At present  --  " he checked his papers  --  " we have thirty carpentersin the Second Battalion , fourteen coopers , eight cabinetmakers . . . . There are many advantages , " he said , " in a citizen army . " " They can do everything but fight , " Hazen said . " For that they need drilling . " He looked up from his notebook . " You drill them , of course ! " " When we can . They are detailed now , from Reveille to Retreat . " Hazen nodded . " I can tell you , Colonel , that General Cooke is most impressed by your industry . He wrote as much to Washington . " The day lifted for Carrington ; the spades and sledge hammers sang . Neither Grant nor Stanton , he said to himself , can fail to be impressed by the endorsement of that hard taskmaster , that grand old leader of dragoons . " How have you managed to cut so much timber ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stockade , and Carrington unrolled one of the many maps that he carried . He pointed first to the hachure lines and then to the base of the mountains . " From this one area , " he said , " we hauled a thousand logs in our first ten days . " " With no interference ? " " We were attacked from the first day . " " And your counter measures ? " Hazen wrote Counter Measures in his notebook and waited . " I organized the wood parties into groups of one hundred . I built two blockhouses in the timbered area wherep205the choppers now stay overnight . I employed as armed guards a body of miners who were prevented by the Indiansfrom getting through to Virginia City . They are camped below the fort . " Hazen nodded as he wrote . He asked : " What else ? " " I laid out the road on this side of Sullivant  --  there , where you see the wood train returning . And up there on the crest of the ridge I post a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first approach of  --  " " He 's signaling now ! " From right to left , three times . " You may see some . . . " Carrington stopped short . Hazen , he remembered in time , had seen a great deal of action during three years of campaigning against the Comanche and the Apache . A general warning now for a handful of Sioux might strike him as hysterical . And no more than a handful seemed to be involved , judging from the gestures of the sentry as he abandoned his post and fled back to the fort . Nonetheless , to Carrington 's dismay , soldiers everywhere dropped their spades and ran helter-skelter around the parade ground , hunting for weapons and ammunition . From the quartermaster 's office Captain Brown lumbered out , buckling on his revolver belt and followed by three soldiers of his staff . Then , seeing Hazen and Carrington , he stopped . He muttered something to his men and ambled back into his tent . Hazen noted this last . " I suppose the quartermaster 's affairs are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown , wrote Hazen : refer to prior reports ; recommendearly relief . Carrington led the inspector south between the rows of tents , unrolling a second chart as he walked and pointing out each site : the headquarters buildings andp206the hospital here on our right ; there , on three sides of the parade ground , the officers ' houses and the barracks for the troops . " One for each company , " he said with emphasis . " I am counting on eight companies . . . . " " First class ! " Hazen declared . " An absolutely firstclassfort ! " " The buildings are my own design , " Carrington said . He unrolled a third chart and explained the details of the company quarters : cross ties and mortices ; tenant grooves and corner sections ; bark outside on the walls , and roofs of corn sacking and sod . As the inspector examinedthe plans , Carrington glanced backward . Three Indians stood waving from the blockhouse . One , as he watched , seized the flag and repeated the signals , mockingthe mounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Carrington led the inspector to the southwest corner of the fort . There , at the water gate , he spoke of the nearness of his coal , the protection that a second stockadewould afford his animals , and the way in which the Little Piney could be diverted into the stockade without exposing a single man to enemy arrows . Hazen listened , and toward the end his black eyebrowslowered . " You sound as if you expect to be besieged , " he said . " I trust you are looking beyond your own defense . " Carrington felt slighted . " My orders from General Sherman are to avoid war , " he said . " At least until my forces are established in strength . " " Ah , but will you avoid war by withdrawing into your shell whenever the hostiles approach ? " My shell . Carrington looked down the length of the great stockade that he had raised ; the mighty fortress.  |p207Until  this moment it had seemed to him unassailable ; now it seemed to be taken , from within . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have reported to you that the Second Infantry is being readied for you , and that two companies of cavalry are already on their way . " " I intend , of course , to impose my will upon the hos-tiles . " " That 's better ! But when , Colonel , when ? " When ? When will the cavalry arrive ; and the breech loaders ; and the ammunition and all the rest that I am promised ? Carrington glanced at the darkening face of the inspector , and his anxieties multiplied . " When ? " Hazen repeated . He was working himself up into that healthy choler that stokes the fires within militaryleaders when opponents fail to conform to the establishedrules of warfare . " Dammit , sir , " he exclaimed , " the Sioux have killed your soldiers and stolen your mules and sacked your trains ! They must be punished ! " " We have killed thirty-seven or more . " " Not enough , Colonel ! Not enough ! " " I have done my best to be just with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have forbidden emigrants to settle in the district . I have banned all trade in whisky . I  --  ' , " Justice for white men is one thing , " Hazen interrupted . " The same justice has no meaning to the redskin . In dealing with the redskin we need less talk of justice , more talk of revenge ! " " I was about to add that nonetheless I realize that I shall have to whip the Sioux . They have given me every provocation . " The general waited.  | " Yet I feel that I must secure my position first . I have one hundred and forty seasoned soldiers , " Carrington cried out , " and a district four hundred miles long to hold ! I must guard my wood trains and my supply trains ! I must build my fort before winter comes ! I must maintainmy communications , north and south ! I must staff my northern posts from my one battalion , and yet I am so shorthanded now that my officers get to bed one night in two ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own executive and overseer ; and when my work is done I visit all my pickets and guards every night ! Scarcely a night passes but  --  " " Where is your post commander ? " " He is not well . You 're right , of course , " Carrington said hastily , " to emphasize my role as district commander . And you will be glad to hear that I have perfectedplans that will assure the safety of all emigration through the district from Laramie to Virginia City . I propose to establish subposts below Reno and at Crazy Woman 's . I have surveyed a third site to the north at the mouth of Goose Creek . I am establishing the post on the Big Horn this week , and before winter I intend , if I can , to build the last fort on the Yellowstone . I  --  " " General Cooke thinks it may be too much for you .

Incidentally , Colonel , I shall be needing twenty-six soldiers to escort me to the Yellowstone , and in addition two officers and a guide . " After a time Carrington said : " I shall lose two coin/panies to the Big Horn post . That will leave just  --  " " I appreciate your position , " Hazen said . " So does General Cooke . " The notebook remained closed in his grip . " Then why  --  " " We have n't the troops , Colonel ! Congress is cutting the Army to shreds ! The Indians are making trouble from Denver to the Gulf ! And Sheridan is having the devil 's own time keeping order in New Orleans ! " " There are six companies idle in Laramie ! " " Idle ? " Hazen smoothed his black beard to its fine point . " Perhaps , " he said , looking out over the stockade to the badlands , " perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrash the hostiles he would considerwhether some of those six companies could be spared . " " It was General Cooke who urged me three weeks ago to exercise extreme caution ; to avoid all risks . " " All unnecessary risks , " Hazen corrected . They walked on in silence until they approached the sutler 's store . Hazen 's stride quickened . " It will do the men good to rub shoulders with an old comrade , " he declared . He had developed a formidable thirst . The sutler 's store was rich in smoke and argument . Glasses gleamed along the counter where Judge Kinneyp210presided . The shelves were loaded : herrings and hams bulged there , coffee and tobacco , sugar and soap . Cheese and crackers were set out for all corners . Beneath the counter , in deference to the Colonel and the chaplain , the ranks of bottles stood . A handyman moved nimbly , washing the tumblers out and setting them up . Seated on benches and chairs arranged along the walls , a score of civilians and soldiers nursed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the counter , slapping a contractor'sback . Ten Eyck slumped in a chair by himself . Bridger smoked and whittled on wood . At a corner table Glover worked on his second dispatch to the Philadelphia Photographer while Adair studied a newspaper . In anothercorner a private of Hazen 's party held before a recruit a black and bedraggled pelt the size of a rat 's back . He wanted two dollars for it ; the recruit was suspicious . " How do I know it come from Sand Creek ? " he demanded . " I tell you , the man who sold it to me just rode in from Denver . His own brother was at the creek with the First Colorado ; took it off her himself . " " Do n't look to me like it come from a squaw 's head . " " Who said it came from her head ? " Alert as always , Bisbee stood at the entrance to the store , wearing the bright sash that marked the officer of the day . " Attention ! " he shouted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . Kinney brought out the Old Crow and filled the general'sglass . " My pleasure to welcome you , General . " " My pleasure to be back among fighting men ! " " And how do you find our establishment ? " Hazen beamed . " Without a doubt , " he declared for all to hear , " Colonel Carrington has designed and built the finest fort in all the West . In fact , " he added , " withp211the single exception of one built in British America by the Hudson Bay Company  --  and at far greater cost  --  I would say it is the finest fort I have ever seen . " " Excellent , " Kinney said , pouring himself a drink . " You make us all feel very proud . " As he put back the bottle , he asked : " You think we have nothing to fear from the red man , then ? " " Fear ! " Hazen was conscious of the silence in the room . " It is for the Indian to fear us ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstanding brave is to be found only in Cooper 's fiction . The real Indian who inhabitsthe plains is a coward who murders the weak and unprotected , but never attacks an armed force ! " He looked around the room and noted with displeasure Glover'swry smile . " The white man , " Hazen said , taking a cracker , " owes the Indian nothing ! The Interior Department has pamperedthe rascals long enough ! It has fed them and clothed them and armed them and equipped them . It has encouraged them to make demands by giving in , and it has given in so often that they no longer fear or respect the government . Disgraceful ! " he declared , and chomp ! he clamped his jaws upon the cracker . " And what is your recommendation ? " Kinney asked . They waited until Hazen reduced the cracker to pulp and washed it down . " I have but one recommendation to make for all Indians , " Hazen announced . " Whip them ! When they are thoroughly whipped , and only then , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whip them ? " Kinney was looking across at Bisbee . " Light expeditions ! That 's how we beat them in Texas in ' 58 and ' 59 ! No artillery ; no wagon trains ; one blanketp212for each man , regardless of the weather , and one pack mule for four men ! Of course , " Hazen added , " it takes men who will endure any hardship ; men who love to fight . There may not be many , but you do n't need many . " He shook his head fiercely at Kinney . " That 's the way to bring them to their knees ! " " And when you 've brought them to their knees ? " Affronted , Hazen turned to Carrington : One of your damned civilians , I suppose ? " Mr. Ridgway Glover , a correspondent . " Hazen nodded , meaning : I suspected as much . " You will have a compliant beggar , " he declared , " in place of an arrogant thief . " He downed the last of his whisky and reached for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Nothing , if you please , " Kinney said . " It has been our pleasure . " Hazen nodded with the barest of smiles and motioned to Bisbee . " Attention ! " Bisbee shouted , and all the soldierssprang up . " At ease , " Hazen said affably ; he departedwith Carrington at his side . Bisbee followed them by way of Adair 's table . Bending over Adair , he whispered : " Next time keep your friend 's mouth shut ! " " There goes an officer , by God . . . . " " Greatest brigade in the Army , Hazen 's Brigade was . " " You should n't have spoken that way , " Adair muttered under the din , and Glover looked up from his writing : " I said what I believed . " " That 's the way to talk about the redskins , " the crowd continued . " Dirty cowards , the general called them . . . . " " Murderers , he said . " " Wait ! " Brown cried . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nasty names ! " He lumbered over and , in his good-natured way , struck Glover on his back.  | " I suppose you did n't like the general calling your friends those names 1 " " No , but I understand why he did . " " Tell us , Mr. Glover , tell us ! " " It eases a man 's conscience to abuse those he has wronged . " " Ah ! " Brown looked around in mock surprise . " So we are the wrong-doers ! We are the thieves ! They never commit theft ! " " Theft is as much of a crime to them as it is to us . " " Well , now ! They just borrowed those three hundred mules and horses , I suppose ! " " They do n't think of it as theft , " Glover said when the laughter died out . " They think of it as revenge . They live by our rule : an eye for an eye . " " We stole their ponies , I suppose ! " " Not their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " their land . " Iii " Oho ! They 're defending their land against the in- vaders ! " " If you like . " " Just patriots . That 's all ! They never murder and steal ! " " I did n't say they . . . " " What about Minnesota , " a miner cried . " Yes , and the Platte ! " the rest added . " And the Michigan volunteers they burned alive ! " . . . " And the lieutenant , cut to bits at Crazy Woman 's ! This son of a bitch was there ! " " I . . . " Glover faltered and could not answer . Brown was disappointed . After a moment he turned to Bridger . " Well , old-timer , you agree the Indians are all liars ? " " They kin lie pretty good , " Bridger said . " So can a lot of white men , " Glover murmured.  | " Not so good as an Injun . In all my years , " Bridger said , " I only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that was Joe Meek . " I remember the time , " Bridger said , " back in ' 35 , when a band of Crows caught Joe on the Yellowstone . Going to kill him , they were , the slow way ; but Joe lied his way right out from under them , by golly . " He drew on his pipe . " Those Crows were so taken by his lying , " he continued , " they wanted to make him chief . But Joe would n't oblige . So they held a great ceremony anyway and the chief gave him his new name . " He peered into his pipe and shook it out in disgust . And since no one else spoke , he said : " They named him Shiam Shaspusia : The Man Who Can Outlie the Crows . " The soldiers stirred . " That 's old Gabe , " they asserted . " That 's the old trapper . " . . . " Takes a mighty quick Indianto outsmart Gabe , I tell you . " " What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eyck 's one good and now reddened eye glared down upon Glover . " It always has been . We granted that . " " We paid for what we took ! " " Three cents an acre . And even then the ring took half of it on the way . " " They still have no right to murder and rob ! " " What else can they do when they are wronged ? They have no law to protect them . They ca n't even get a hearingwhen the government breaks its promises . " " The government never broke a treaty ! " " It never kept one ! " " They 're savages ! " " What have we done to civilize them ! " " Civilize ! ' When I hear that word , " Bridger said , " I hit out for the hills . "  |p215Ten  Eyck turned on the old man . " You do n't go along with General Hazen ? " Bridger shook his head . " Like the rest of you , all spunk and no gumption . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up here on grain-fed horses ! Charging about as if the country was yours ! Just because you overpoweredsome damn fool Confederates with a lot of artillery , you figure you can whip Injuns . " " So we can ! " " Hah ! Injuns live off the country , " Bridger said . " They live with the country . Their ponies are grass-fed and their people are game-fed . They can outsmart you and outfightyou as well as outnumber you and outrun you ; and there is n't a man among you sees it or wants to see it , save the Colonel . " " General Hazen  --  " Ten Eyck began ; the rest overtook him . " General Hazen 's fought Indians a lot longer than the Colonel has . You heard what he . . . " Bridger knocked out his pipe , stood up , and started for the door . " Do n't leave us yet , Jim , " a miner pleaded . Bridger shook his head . " I 'm an old man . I lack the time for fools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk closed over him . " Calls himself a major ; never led a company of regularsin his life . " " Seen no more fighting than the Colonel . " . . . " Talks like we should fear the redskins . You heard what the general said  --  it 's for them sons of bitches to fear us ! " Adair had suffered the argument in silence . Now , in defiance and misery , he turned upon Glover . " You 're so quick to condemn the Army . What would you do ! " " I do n't know . " When I headed West , Glover thought ,  |p216one  of my dreams was to travel the road all the way to California with my camera . I wanted to be the first to photograph all the country that would soon be ours . And now I . . . " I 'd leave this country to the Indians , " he said . " Leave this country ! Where every rock rings with the sound of metal and every stream shines with the color of gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrender we will not ! We have laid a king 's ransom already , " he said , lookingaround the room , " on the altars of false altruism and sentimentality . The time has come for the new nation to claim its own ! " " He 's right ! " The crowd affirmed . " The judge is right ! " . . . " We given them too much already ! " . . . " There 's no need . . . " Segregate them , yes , " Kinney continued . " Subdue them first , and when they implore us for peace , then segregate them , but not in this magnificent country ! Allot them some modest acreage . . . " " Some modest acreage ! First we ceded them all the land west of the Alleghenies , " Glover cried . " Then it was everything west of the Mississippi . Then the country west of the Missouri was to be theirs , finally and forever ; then all the plains ; then Oklahoma and the Dakota Territory ; and now some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " continued Kinney , " where they can practice husbandry . . . . " Under Army control , " added Ten Eyck . " By all means  --  under Army control . " " No ! " Glover protested , remembering the old chief at Kearney and all the half-breeds and the mealtimes when the sergeants doled out soup boiled from steers ' heads to the silent , beaten people . " You destroy every principle they live by ! " he cried.  | " Every principle ? " Kinney smiled around the room . " Sobriety , " Glover said . " You ever seen a sober Indian ? " someone called out . " Chastity . " Glover added . " They were proud of it once , before we corrupted them ! Do n't talk of segregating them , " he cried . " Not on Army reservations ! If you want to exterminate them , then do it quickly and cleanly ! Do it with bullets and blades . Invite them all to one great feast and feed them beef salted with wolfsbane . And let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . Or else . . . " There came to him vividly the evenings he had spent in Laramie , in the tepees of Standing Elk and Running Bear and the Man Who Walks under the Ground ; all good friends of mine , he had written in the first of his dispatches , and not to be abandoned now. . . or else treat them as brothers , " he said . " As brothers ! " . . . " The sons of bitches that killed poor Livelsberger yonder ! " . . . " And Callery , the boy who  --  " " And Terrell , do n't forget . " . . . " And the lieutenant ! " . . . " And Johnson and Gilchrist , poor buggers . . . " " Whip them , like the general said , " cried the soldier of Hazen 's party . " Thrash them good , like the First Coloradodid Black Kettle ! " " He was flying the American flag , " Glover protested . " It was a cover ! " Bisbee stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaned out a robbers ' roost ! " " They shot and scalped women ! " " The women were shooting at them ! " " And children  --  three-year-old children ! " " An error . " " It was n't no error , " Hazen 's soldier said . " Chivington told them to . You know what he told them ? " He looked around , grinning . " Nits make lice . " " That 's enough ! " ordered Bisbee . " Every man report forp218retreat ! " He stood at the entrance , and as the soldiers filed out , he gripped Adair 's arm . " I 'm warning you for the last time ! " Iodide of ammonia . . . Glover stuffed the bottle into his case . Iodide of cadmium . . . " You did it to harm me ! " Adair was staring at the wall of his tent . " You wanted to cut me off from the others ! You  --  " " I said what I believed . " Five bronze plates for the ferrotypes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He told you to keep quiet when General Hazen was around . And you  --  " " I 'm not in the Army . " " Well , I am ! And my brevet 's before the board , and I earned it with all my wounds , and Hazen was watching and if he reports . . . You knew that and you thought  --  you thought that if you . . . " I did n't think , " Glover said , " but it does n't matter now . " He eased the Roettger down into its case and bound it with a leather strap . He reached for his bedroll and his knapsack . Adair muttered : " Where are you going to stay ? " " With the wood choppers . They 're saving a bunk for me in the blockhouse . " " It 's dangerous up there . "  | " It 's close to the mountains , where I want to be . " " You 're not allowed to go out alone ! You 're forbidden to leave the post without arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't carry arms ! " Glover shook his head . " You do n't care about yourself , do you ? " " I never did . " " You think that because you 're so pure in heart no harm can come to you ! " Glover hoisted his pack and bedroll onto his shoulders ; he grasped his cases . He stood for a moment , hoping that Adair would look up to say good-by . But Adair lay staring at the tent wall . When his orderly brought in the midday plate of mush , he still did not stir . All night above the rain he heard the rushing water in the ravine and felt its cascade cold upon his hands and face . Forgive us our trespasses . The rain wound its musical way down the logs , close by his head . If only we felt the need to be forgiven ! Toward dawn the rain ceased . Some time later a mountain wind sighed in the pines . The wood choppers shifted in their bunks around him , and , listening to theirhoarse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They feel no urge to command ; they have not becomep220inured to killing . They work for a living and demand no more . They regard me as a madman and accept me as I am . In the chill hour before sunrise he rose and stoked the stove in the center of the hut and set the coffeepot upon it to warm , and later the frying pan . The sputter of grease awoke the choppers . They laced their boots , gulped down the coffee and bacon , and filed off , shoulderingtheir broad axes and complaining of no more than the weather . Glover in turn gathered two days ' rations , rolled up his buffalo skin , and set out , up the ravine . All that was green glittered after the rain : mandrake and lady fern ; the sawtooth cherry , the ancient moss . Beneath the shroud of pine and hemlock branches the torrent was frosty , whitened by the mountain snow . In the winding gut of the gorge the rock walls narrowedand rose sheer into the mist . The path , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past shale that sparkled with mica and fool 's gold to shelves of feldspar and juniper , whose dark needles drew blood from his fingers . He welcomed the pain . Four hundred feet higher he stood again in a forest of Douglas fir . There the trail ended . He circled to the southeast ; he came to a precipice ; he stood , shielding his eyes against the brilliant day . The pinnacles of rock around him were raised by the sun to the color of a tiger 's hide . Beneath him the cloud layer reached to the horizon unbroken , save at the mountain 's edge . There , from hidden ridges , the tallest of the pines pierced the surface , the masts and spars of schooners sunk beneath a frozen sea . Beneath the surface , he thought , in the dimness of that underworld , lives the garrison , all unaware . The officers now are shaking off their dreams of honor and exploit and damning the sullen day . Brown is buckling on his armor and Bisbee . . . Ip221shouted out about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bisbee answered : " The women were shooting at them ! " He reached down , seeing a fir cone caught on the cliff 's edge and thinking : It has n't a chance to grow there . He plucked the winged seeds from the rusty core and flung them out and watched them spiraling downward , down the tall cliffside . He felt himselfdrawn after them : he pressed back , lay back against the ledge , his eyelids clamped tight , his head ringing . He heard again the laughter of the soldiers within and all around him until it sharpened into one shrill voice coming from one place over his head . He looked up . From a pine branch above him a red squirrel upbraided him , its tail jerking convulsively with each harsh word , as angry with me , he thought , as I am with the officers ; as absurd to me as I am to them . The squirrel chattered on , expending its futile rhetoric . Then , since it could not drive him out , it affected to ignore him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner agitation . Higher in the pine a grosbeak lifted one shoulderand preened the bright feathers beneath its wing . Twisting around the branch ends , a warbler with a gray back and yellow throat picked insects from the pine needles , pausing to utter one weak and monotonous song . The sun warmed him . Leaning on one elbow , he saw that the ledge beneath him was sandstone , heaved up from the ocean floor God knew how long ago and engravedwith the delicate flutings of shellfish , the fans still unbroken . In the threads of earth that lined the rock , thin flowers wavered  --  a white cluster , a diminutive primrose , and , taller , the dodecatheon , the shooting star , its violet stamen aimed at the earth , its rose petals trailing upward as if it were fleeing down the sky . Have I fled ? he wondered . I wanted to join them ; yetp222we were always at odds , save for that one day at Crazy Woman 's Crossing . There deeds counted for more than words , and , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  orforgotten . But after that we grated on each other , we fought and I failed . They saw only an enemy in the Indian : one who had killed their comrades . To war against that enemy was to vindicate their dead ; to live in peace with him was to betray their dead . I could not speak . I could not say I also loved Terrell , but that as I mourned beside his body , pierced by their arrows , love itselfreminded me that men with an equal claim upon life were mourning beside their dead , punctured by our bullets . I could not speak of the moment by the river when they spared me . I was not their enemy : they could not be mine . In the rising country west of the forest the gorge gave way to rocky slopes . A trail led upward there , and he followed it , forcing a way through thickets still laden with rain . For a time an animal moved alongside him in the undergrowth , half hidden until they came to a clearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a badger . It bared its teeth , it hissed to hold him at bay , and all the while it was tearing at the earth , hurling gravel and tufts of grass up at such a furious rate that in no time it had submerged into a cavern of its own creation , from whose black interior only its yellow eyes showed . Glover thought of Adair ; he pressed on , over ridges and into gulleys , until he came to a region where everything was dead . The charred skeletons of pine trees leaned there or stretched out along the ground , their bark burned away , revealing all the secret passageways of the borers . Beneath the great husks he found the first signs of renewal , green seedlings of the lodge-polep223pine , sprung from the tight-fisted cones that fire alone could force . A shallow stream descending in stages from swamp grass to still pool marked the end of the fire and the return of the forest . Once more the ground was light beneathhim and the air cool . A gray shrub thrived in the shade of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers , star-shaped , bordered the stream . He followed it , free of all fatigue , for a mile or more until it entered a glen . Everything was gentle there , the sunlightsifting through sheaths of pine and aspen and bindingall color , as chalk would , in soft shades of green . The flowers once more were blue and yellow , repeating in a higher key the patterns of the valley . Larkspur for lupin , beardtongue for sunflower ; he bent to pick them at the wood 's edge and halted . A black bear moved on the far side of the glen , rooting in the soft earth , and close by , he saw now , three bull elk resting in the shade . He waited without moving , and they stared at him , grinding their jaws in silence and occasionally tossing their antlered heads . This place is enchanted , he thought ; there is a spell cast over us , and none of us can escape . A moment passed that he could not measure , and the spell broke . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shook themselves and stalked away , slipping into the patchwork of light and shadow . The wild strawberries were ripe in the glen ; the water of the stream was marvelously cold and fresh . I could live here all summer long , he thought , and through the autumn until snow falls . And on through the winter if I could learn to sleep beneath the snow as the animals do . Then in the spring I could head west with Bridger and never return to live in the garrison . I failed there , he repeated to himself , walking on be/neath the pines , and not just because I could not argue my case . I failed because it flowed from my belief but not from my being . I spoke of brotherhood ; I presumed to speak for love . But love  --  love does not insist on its own way . An animal snorted close by him ; dead branches crackled as it struck out away from him . Yet he could see no movement in the dense wood he had entered , nothing but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too close to bear branches . And though there was light between them , it did not reach far . A few trees slanted , scaly , in blades of sunlight . The rest were dark and upright , like the shafts of a thousand spears . They seemed to close around him ; he felt suddenly that if he halted they would hold him fast . He pressed on , brushing the sweat from his forehead . His buffalo hide caught on the rough bark ; his boots were sucked into the swampy soil . When at last he came to open ground he stepped out with a sense of release . He threw down his load and rested on the pine needles , turning his face to the faint wind . Love bears all things ; believes all things , hopes all things , endures all things . Not within me , he thought , not after the Friends sat in judgment upon me three years ago . I could bear no responsibility after that : I had no belief in myself . I hoped for nothing beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a state of grace . I turned to the West . The Indians became for me the wronged , the unloved , the defeated . Yet I could not help them . I should have worked to make friends of enemies ; instead I took their enemies , the officers , as mine . I hated the officers for their harshness . It never occurred to me that it was a shield for their fear . Brown , for instance : Brown fears goodness withinp225himself . Bisbee fears goodness in all men . Kinney must destroy goodness because he can not pay for it . I fought with them as I had to , but with their weapons . I longed for victory over them , victory on their terms . But now , he thought , I am beginning to understand that there are two kinds of victory . The first is to win the struggle , the second is to transcend it . He opened his eyes as a bold declaration rang out through the forest above him  --  a strong voice , but no singer , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a pine twig , lord in its kingdom . He stood up and walked on . Along the rise ahead of him the alpine fir stood in somber groups . The pines that towered among them were older , and one , he saw , was marred , the armor plating of its trunk torn open high above his head . Outcroppings of granite thrust up from the ridge like gray teeth . And in their roots there were dark entrances  --  lairs . He found , wedged into one crevice in the rock , a tawny corpse , a doe , its rump devoured , its neck broken and dangling , the cache of a carnivore . A mile farther on , his path led into an ancient hollow . Its high walls of granite were hoary with gray lichen . Its damp floor was covered with ferns . And hidden among the ferns were giant bones . The place stirred up some dry memory within him , one without origins or a name . This is the retreat , he decided , where monarchs come to die . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From a nest of grass beneath it a mouse with round ears and a russet back regarded him with shining eyes . As he strode on up the slope , he was conscious of being watched . He halted and heard over the wind in the pines a soft whistle . He moved quietly over the pine needles , searching in all directions until he saw the stranger : a gray bird the size of a robin ,  |p226with  a rounded tail and a white head . Camp Robber , the wood choppers called it . It glided from tree to tree behind him , hiding within tufts of pine needles , clinging to the far sides of limbs , pretending to busy itself in low shrubs , and all the while studying him . Ignore it ; but at the bird 's harsh note of warning , he glanced around and saw on the trail ahead the gray hull of the grizzly . Nosing in a musty stump , with one stroke it tore the umber structure apart and snuffed among the ruins , whining softly as a newborn would as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , he thought . I can cling , but I can not climb , the branches too high , too frail to support . If I step backward , halting when he looks up . . . If I . . . One , Two , Three , Red Light ! He smiled , remembering the children 's game . Try it . One . . . he stepped backward ; but at Two the bear cheated . It looked up . It rocked back on its hind legs , twisting its neck , cocking its ears , peering dimly in his direction , its snout raised , drawing in all scent . The dark ruff rose along its neck and shoulders as it dropped . It slouched two steps toward him , rasping and coughing . Then , at some new scent or cry of the bird , it backed off , turned , and slid with no sound over the ridge . And soon the moment itself slid away , beyond recapture . He was tall , thought Glover , forming the phrases for his third dispatch to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have weighed fifteen hundred pounds or more , he thought , with rising elation . One lick from his paw would have settled my coffee for me instantly ; no more dispatches from your Rocky Mountain . . . I really was in danger , he realized , and then the question returnedlike the bird to haunt him : Was I spared ? Every man bears some gift within him , he thought , climbing on . And his gift is his responsibility . If I wasp227spared , then , whatever the reason may be , my role is clear : to go unarmed where others can not ; to break the ring of fear that grips the garrison ; to find a way where no way exists to peace . He headed south now , toward the crest of the range . The torrent sounded far beneath him ; to the west the gray peaks , the Big Horns , rolled around the horizon like waves in winter . He crossed a wide meadow , he forded the river , he clambered up the rough way worn by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hidden lake . From its clear depths trout rose languidly to taste his bread crumbs and settled back among the limbs of sepulchral trees . Three lakes lay in succession in the basin of the peaks . Beneath the dark and resolute firs that guarded the highestof them he found a bank of snow , all untouched , all as pure as the day it descended . With the snow approachedsome distant relation of peace . Not the peace of contentment , he thought ; not the peace of certainty , and not my father 's faith in an ultimate , limitless good . I believe in goodness of a limited kind . I know that from good men goodness flows to others . And perhaps if a man were altogether good . . . then he might be used . That , for me , would be a state of grace . And though I shall never attain it , I know now what grace would consist of for me : to seek good for its own sake , to cherish life in all things save myself , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leave that word to them  --  with my whole will , to find sweetness in solitude and solace in defeat , to create in my core a sanctuary where envy can not trespass to wither and blight , nor regret for all my errors , nor fear of death . Under the forest cloak the snowdrifts mounted until at the timber line the fir gave way to stunted juniperp228and the juniper to rock and shale . Scores of live things scurried into hiding there , bleating like lambs . He rested against a boulder , and after a moment they reappeared from every crevice : gray animals no bigger than rats , with round ears and short tails and well-filled paunches and old men 's whiskers . They sniffed and sized him up and , once persuaded he was no bear or wolf or mountain lion , went on about their work , severing the stems of grass and sedge and stuffing them into their rock lairs , haystacks to last through the winter . He climbed on , laboring at that altitude , over the last of the shale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At sundown he came to the crest of Cloud Peak . In that arctic world no man could last long . Whipped by the wind and shivering , he drew on grubby paper the sketch that would serve in place of a stereoscopic view . Eight thousand feet below him the desert was inflamed south of Reno by the last of the sunlight . Under the shadow of the mountains the green tracing of Crazy Woman 's wormed past the crossing and off into the badlands . Turning north into the full force of the wind , and shieldinghis eyes , he looked over the country he had traveled through the long day : the three lakes , thimbles filled with water ; the ridges , furrows raised by moles . The snow fields beneath him were cold and colorless , but westward from his perch , around the rim of the range , the peaks burned into the twilight . He trudged downward on the snow , and for a time in the dusk the snow and the sky were equal in grayness and indistinct . The earth tilted under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon air and , stumbling , reached out blindly until he struck the crust . At the edge of the snow field he slumped upon the shale and slept uncov/ered and unconcerned though the temperature fell below freezing . When the steepness of the slope and the shale 's jagged edges awoke him , he looked up to a full moon and saw above the snow fields a sky Prussian blue and star bright . He walked on in the moonlight until he stood again among the boulders at the forest 's edge . There he ate his hard bread , aware of a whiskered audience . After a time the small shapes ventured out and , moonstruck , tore over and around the rocks , squeaking in fury or desire and pausing fitfully to snip the grass . At home in their company , he rolled himself in his buffalo hide and stretched out on a flat rock among them , never suspectingthat they were the prey of night prowlers . The animals scurrying back and forth across his body left faint imprints on his consciousness as he settled into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gibson sat writing . He wrote in a large script on a borrowed pad in an effort to lift from his mind and heart the apathy and bewilderment that had pressed upon him like a dead weight since the night of his arrest on Pilot Hill . He wrote slowly , groping for words whose meaning he had never considered before , and for ideas as distant and dim as the hill itself . The spelling of the words also bothered him.  |p230From  time to time he paused to enlist the aid of the sentry who stood between him and the day . But the sentry was a recruit of his own age , unable to spell and forbidden to answer . Gibson read over many times what he had written . He continued to stare at it until the sergeant of the guard came for him . In the midst of his escort he shuffled in a boneless way to the headquarters tent . He stood there before the Colonel , staring at the ground . Carrington in turn was unable to face him . Does he blame me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I am responsible ? If I had not ridden up to Pilot Hill that evening , he would not now be a prisoner under sentence of death . He cleared his throat . " You understand , do you not , the requirements of militaryjustice ? " The prisoner barely nodded . " You realize that your action left your superiors no choice ? " Another bare nod . " To be drunk on duty is a very grave dereliction of your military duties . To be asleep at your post is an even graver delinquency . " The prisoner seemed to be asleep once more . Carrington consulted his papers . " You were found drunk and asleep on the night of July 28 . You were placed under arrest . You were charged and subsequently tried under the terms of a general court-martial instituted by your company commander and approved by your districtcommander under authority vested in him by the Secretary of War . The board , composed of officers of the United States Army , took sworn testimony for and against you , and weighed it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " You have been informed of that verdict ? " No response . The sergeant jabbed the prisoner sharply with his elbow . " Yes , " he mumbled . " Yes , sir ! " hissed the sergeant . " Yes , sir . " Carrington sighed . " Have you any reservations concerning the jurisdiction of the board or the propriety of the verdict ? " Gibson turned slightly toward the sergeant . The sergeantshook his head . " Are there any mitigating circumstances you wish to bring to my attention ? You realize , " Carrington added after a moment , " that if there are none , then the sentenceof the board is mandatory : I have no choice to concur . Are there any mitigating circumstances ? " he asked again . He waited . Gibson turned once more toward the sergeant ; he seemed more afraid of the sergeant than of the sentence . The sergeant shook his head . Dutifully Gibson 's head moved in negation , but Carrington rebuked the sergeant : " Let him speak for himself . " Gibson for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fumbled in his pocket , brought forth the crumpled sheet , and held it out to the Colonel . My trouble , Carrington read : My TroubleI do not know what I am soppose to do about my trouble . I must not wory my self more or think more or I shall loss my mine . When they tried me the Lt said I was a criml . He said I must be shot . I ast why . I must set an exampl . Because I was drunk and slept . The reason I drunk was I was thirsty . Therep232was no water there . I never drunk before . The reasonI slept was I could not help it . I was tird out . I do nt see how to set an exampl but I must not think any more . He said I all most lost the fort to the Indians . If I did wrong I am sory . The sergeant grew impatient ; his squad was waiting outside . " If the Colonel , " he began , " if the Colonel . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was saying to himself . Judge not lest ye be judged . And yet I am judge . Freedom , he said to himself ; freedom requires that all citizens be responsible , that they answer for their own actions . " If the Colonel has no more to say . . . " But freedom means the right to err , and that right implies , in turn , the duty to forgive . " Attention ! " the sergeant ordered . " About face ! " " As you were ! " Carrington said . " I can not keep you on in the guardhouse , " he told Gibson . " We can not afford to keep any idle men . " Gibson nodded . " I can not grant you a dishonorable discharge . Many of my men would regard that as a reward . " Gibson 's eyes were closed ; he swayed a little . The sergeantlicked his lips . " Nor can I sanction your execution . And so , " Carringtonsaid , " I will give you your choice . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of this fort alone , with a mule . " " Any mule ? " " Any mule . And a rifle ; and one hundred rounds of ammunition ; and rations enough to last you three days . Leave at sundown for your own protection ; and do not return . "  |p233Gibson  murmured : " I 'll take the mule . " At once Carrington wondered if he had acted foolishly . Bisbee will be furious , he thought ; even the sergeant looks as if he had just been betrayed . From a distant day in Nebraska a wise man spoke to the Colonel : " Next to cowardice and indecision , pity is the fault most to be feared in a commander . " He wondered : Am I guilty of pity ? " See that my orders are executed ! " The fierceness of the Colonel 's command rocked the sergeant . " About face ! " he shouted fiercely in his turn . He marched the prisoner out and kept on shouting as his squad moved off . For the mules of Phil Kearny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their work done , their thirst slaked , they stood in select groups in the cottonwoodcorral , heads resting on one another 's rears . Each group had its chosen circle of members and discouraged by biting those who edged in , uninvited . Each group stood over its favored watering place ; it watered no others . By the gate of the corral a gray mule stood apart , held by one man , curried by another . Gibson , holding the halter , felt ready to drift wherever the wind blew . Snake , working beside him , could see no sense at all in giving up a good mule to die with a boy in the hills . The way things are going , he figured , a mule 's worth more than a man.  |p234But  he worked on , thinking : It 's their mule , not mine . The mule mouthed Gibson 's shoulder in an intimate and melancholy way . " Whoa , there , " Gibson said . " Whoa , whatever your name is . " " Calfhead , " Snake said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name 's Calfhead . " " Whoa , Calfhead ! " But the mule felt its way with blind lips up to Gibson 's collar and tasted his neck . " Will he bite ? " Gibson spoke in a whisper , conscious of the immenseear cocked close to his face . Snake looked at the boy with a grieved look . " Why , he 's as gentle as a kitten . " He went on brushing the mule with long , smooth strokes . " Why do you brush him ? " Gibson wanted to know . " It pacifies him . " " Feels like he 's going to bite , " Gibson said , hunching his shoulder up to his neck . The brush halted . " Hell , boy , " Snake exclaimed . " That mule wo n't bite ! Not unless he thinks you 're afraid of him . " " I reckon I am . " Gibson 's head was pressed against his shoulder , and the mule 's lips fondled his ear . " Fool him , then . Do n't let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gibson said . And he succeeded . The mule merely pulled some loose tufts from his collar and stood wrinkling his nose as the wool threads tickled him . Gibson was pleased . " I fooled him , " he declared . " I guess that 's why they called him Calfhead , " he added . " Because he 's so easily fooled . " " No , " Snake said . " You 're wrong there . " He drew from a rump pocket an ominous truncheon , two inches thick and black as tar . Krawl He tore a quid off . He rolled it around in his mouth to soften it up and deep in a lower gum laid it to rest.  | " See his head ? " he remarked . " Kind of squashed down in the middle ? " By maneuvering his jaws , he brought two teeth to bear upon the tobacco . " Head 's just like a calf 's , " he concluded , " so his name come nacherly : Calfhead . " Real gentle he is . Not like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that Hammerhead . " He motioned with his head toward a gaunt beast . " Kick the sweetening off a ginger cake , that son of a bitch would ! " Whoot ! He sent the first of many dark jets of tobacco juice in the direction of the jack . " Grabbed me by the left cheek once , " he said , " when I was bending over to feel his hoof . Picked me up and shook me like a dog , Hammerhead did . " Gibson looked at the outline of the mule 's head . And he could see right away that it was like a sledge hammer , long and flat and blunt at both ends . " Sure looks like a hammer , " he said . " Maybe so , but his name come different . A sergeant was holding him like you 're holding Calfhead here , " Snake added . " And damn if that devil did n't reach down and seize hold of him . Right here , " he explained , touching a sensitive spot , and arrunch ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Had to take a hammer to his head before he let go . Hammerhead , " he affirmed , " and that gray molly mule is Hairbelly , seeing as her belly is all hairy ; and that brown one is Bisbee , does n't like mule skinners any more'n Bisbee does ; and that one beside him is Ten Eyck , sleeps all day long ; and that little mousy one  --  see the one I mean ? " Gibson nodded . " Standing off by itself . " " Pissant . " Gibson looked up , startled . " That 's his name . Kind of small , doncherknow . " Gibson agreed . " Small and sorry . " " Size does n't matter , though . It 's spirit that counts.  |p236You  see that little black mule , there ? " Snake leaned close to Timson . " I seen her kick a nigger higher'n a telegraph pole ! " They both glanced skyward , seeing the dark body somersaulting as it rose and hung suspended and fell : thud ! " A jay bird could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressively , " by the time he come back down . " The Negro 's misfortune left Gibson shaken . " You 're sure this one is broke ? " he asked . Snake 's near eye , blurred and red as the western horizon , regarded Gibson . " Worried , ai n't you ? " he observed . Gibson nodded , not wanting the mule to know . " Like I was , " Snake said , " first time I took a team for Old John . " He hawked ; he hitched up his trousers . " Come up to me , Old John did , when me and my lead mule were squaring off . You know what he said ? " Gibson shook his head . " ' Do n't worry , ' Old John said to me . You 're as smart as he is , if not smarter . ' " Had the smartest lead mule I ever saw , Old John did , " Snake went on . " Name of Big Richard ; always trying something new . " With his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll never forget the time Big Richard had a mind to go slow . Old John did n't say a word ; he never laid a hand on his bullwhip . Just picked him a pine cone off a pine tree they were passing . Climbed down from the wagon , Old John did , and walked beside Big Richard for a mile or more . And neither one let on he knew the other was there . Pretty soon Big Richard lifts his tail to break wind . And quick as a wink Old John slips the pine cone underneath . " Whoot ! The gob curved over Calfhead 's rump . " Damn near caused a stampede ! " Another time Old John had a swang mule name of Old Tom . Liked to wander off from the herd at night , Old Tom did . Got so deaf I reckon he could n't hear thep237bell mare any more . Old John spent three mornings trackinghim down . On the fourth morning he said to hell with it . You know what he did ? " Snake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the gummy wad . " Rubbed a quid of tobacco in his eyes . " He looked at the wad ; he squeezed it gently and restored it to its spongy bed . " Old Tom stuck right by the campfire from then on , " he said . " Course , I do n't say you can abuse a mule . But you show me a mean mule , " Snake added , " and I 'll show you a mean master . You treat ' em right and there is n't one wo n't bend over backwards to help you along . " I tell you , " Snake said complacently , " this Calfhead will be the greatest companion you ever had out there . He 'll smell water miles away . He 'll smell Indians further'n water . He 'll keep an eye out for wolves . He 'll be a father to you and a brother . " Gibson nodded . He glanced at the sunset and across to the gate of the corral . " I reckon I better be on my way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's neck . " Easy , boy . " He slipped off the halter and reached down with the bridle . " Easy , now . " But Calfhead felt neither fatherhood nor brotherhood for Gibson . He backed off and butted ; he sawed violently with his head . Snake was unperturbed . " Never hurry them , " he told Gibson . He pressed the bit against the mule 's upraised mouth . The loose lips parted , but the yellow grinders held fast together . " Here ! You hang onto his head while . . . while I . . . Hang on ! " Snake shouted . But as the mule reared , Gibson slid back to the ground . " Ho ! " Snake cried . " Got to . . . show him . . . who 's master . . . . Here ! " he cried to Gibson . " Grab hold of his ear ! " Gibson reached up ; he gripped the fur and held on . " Now . . . Whoa !  |p238When  I . . . Hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . . . you bite on his ear till I . . . Bite ! " he shouted , and Gibson bit . The mule reared upward , all but tearing Gibson 's teeth out ; then , breaking loose , it bucked and bounded off . " Hard , you got to bite hard , " Snake muttered as Calfheadcareened among the clusters of offended mules . " Like a bulldog is the only way : get a good grip and hang on . See that mule there ? " He pointed . " The one with half an ear gone ? Bit his ear clean off , John Bratt did , same as he bit the ear off a wagon boss who would n't pay him in cash . Never had any more trouble from either one . " They shuffled across the corral , looking as innocent as they could in an effort to deceive Calfhead . " Good boy , good boy , " Snake murmured . But Calfhead snorted and lashed out with both hind legs . Three times they cornered him , and each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the mules were riled up , and all of them , stampeding , raised a thick screen of dirt . Snake was discouraged . " There 's a fine mule , that Hairbelly , " he remarked as they trudged through the dust . And since Gibson did not feel committed to Calfhead , they changed direction and attempted to corner Hairbelly . But she was as inconsiderate as Calfhead , and the dozen other mules that they approached were no better . As darkness closed in , they stood frustrated in the centerof the corral . The mules formed again their select and now suspicious groups . Only the one outcast , the little mouse-colored one , stood apart . Snake spied him as the dust settled , and he beckoned to Gibson . " Like I said , " he told Gibson , " size do n't matter . " He edged up to the mule 's side . " It 's spirit that counts , " he declared grandly ; and , sure enough , the mule was so broken in spirit that it stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he eased the bridle over its low-hung head ; its jaws parted without protest at the touch of the bit . " There ! " Snake announced . " Just a matter of knowing who 's master , that 's all ! May not be much to look at , " he added as they wrapped the girth around the sagging belly , " but this here Pissant has a heart like a lion . Carry you clean back to the States , this little feller will ! " Gibson said nothing ; he glanced once more at the gate of the corral ; he saw no shadow lingering there . I thought maybe . . . Well , he said to himself , I guess he is n't coming down to see me off after all ; does n't want to pay me the money he owes me , I reckon , or else he 's drunk again ; or maybe he just forgot . " Which way you heading ? " Snake inquired , holding up the mule 's head . " I do n't know  --  east , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's water . " Gibson nodded . He gathered up his few belongings . He thrust the Springfield into the saddle holster . He stuffed a three-day supply of hardtack and the ammunition into the saddle bags . He gripped the reins and the horn of the saddle and placed one boot in the stirrup . He withdrew it . " Reckon I 'll walk him past the Piney , " he murmured . He lifted the reins over the mule 's head . " Here , " he whispered , " here ! " But the mule needed no urging . With all the sweet loyalty and obedience that Snake had dwelt upon , Pissant followed his new master out into exile and the wilderness.  | " One , " he said . " Give me one . " " One for the Reverend . " Brown slid the card along the table and watched for a telltale sign upon the Reverend 's face . A faint grimace : never , never draw to an inside straight , White reminded himself , not even if the pot is loaded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brightened by a few coins . He sighed . Ah , well , he thought , riches profit not in the day of wrath . And this day , the Lord knows , is wrathful . And that reminds me . He looked across the table to Bisbee , saying : " I hear they were Arapahoes . " During a poker game Bisbee spoke only to draw , to bet , and to declare . He studied his hand . " Arapahoes " White repeated ; he waited . " Who knows , " Bisbee muttered , " and who cares ? " " The Colonel cares , " Kinney murmured as he pushed one card toward the dealer . " The Colonel would n't want his friends the Cheyennes established as killers ! " Brown handed the judge his card . " Flushing ! " he said pleasantly , and then his mouth arched downward . " They 're all killers ! There is n't a band among them that would n't kill any white man who walks out there alone ! " " Alone , " White echoed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards and struck a match . " Ap241lifetime of study , " he began , and he paused to suck the flame into the crater of his half-smoked cigar , " has led me to the conclusion  --  " he drew again on the flame until the rich smoke oozed along the rim of the cigar  --  " that men who decline to drink for religious or moral reasons  --  " he sent a wreath of smoke spiraling over the table  --  " come to a bad end . " He tossed a silver coin among the coffee beans , and when Bisbee declined to be bluffed out , he shrugged his shoulders and turned in his hand . White enfolded the cards in his long fingers , shuffled them , and flicked them out with his thumb . He said : " I hear he started out for the fort at dusk . " Once more he waited , and when the others failed to respond , he added : " They tell me the wood choppers begged him to wait until this morning . " " As usual , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He lived by his own rules , " Kinney said . " And died by them , " the Reverend added . " He died as the fool dieth . " Brown looked upon the brighter side of the incident . " All the men , " he said , " will carry weapons from now on . " He drew to an inside straight and gained it , defeating the kings up that Bisbee supposed would win . Bisbee in turn was angered . He blamed the Reverend : How can anyone concentrate when he talks so damned much ? he said to himself . His fingers drummed a warningon the table . White cut for the judge . Insensitive to the warning , he tested the last of the rumors that had reached him . " They tell me , " he said , " that Bob North was leading the Arapahoes . I understand he has his own method of cutting a man 's  --  " Bisbee turned upon him . " Play poker or else get out and let us play ! "  | " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's that to you ? " " It 's my job " White complained . " I need details to write up the obituary . " " So you do . " Kinney smiled . " And , speaking of your job , " he added , " what are you going to report to Washingtonthis month about our den of sin ? " He continued to smile as he dealt the cards . " The same as last month , " White said . " I shall report that , while industry , vigor , and sound judgment are displayedby the Colonel . . . " " That 's none of your business , " snapped Bisbee. . . the moral condition of the post leaves much to be desired . Oh , you know the language as well as I do , " White exclaimed . " Profanity is widespread , intemperanceis prevalent . . . . " " What do you expect in this God-forsaken wilderness ? " Brown protested . He gulped down his whisky and poured himself another . White eyed the bottle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muttered , " strong drink is raging . ' " " And so are the men raging with thirst at the end of the day ! " Brown wiped his mouth with the back of his hand . " By God , if a man ca n't  --  " " Come now , " Kinney said , " the Reverend has his job to do as you have yours . " And what , " Kinney continued as he dealt the last of the cards , " will you report to the Adjutant General about our wicked sutler ? " " You know as well as I do what I have to say . " " Well ? " They waited , smiling . White sensed that there was no escape . " I commend the Congress for abolishing the office of sutler . I . . . " His words creeping forth were crushed by Brown 's laughter.  |p243Kinney  hushed the laughter . " Do n't think that you offendme , " he said . " At the rate I am losing money , you would do me a favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you charge  --  " Brown began . Kinney cut him short . " The Indians , " he said , " steal half my stock before it reaches me , and one train travels the road where there should be ten by now . " " Nothing will prosper until the savages are whipped , " White said . " And the savages , " Brown added , " will not be whipped until we are led by a fighting man . " They played the hand in silence , and when Bisbee had won , Kinney turned toward him . " By the way , " he said casually , " I hear the mail carrier brought you a letter from Sedgwick . " Bisbee stacked his coins in symmetrical columns . He did not reply . " Yes , " Brown added . " what did Fetterman write ? " Bisbee shuffled the cards and handed them to Kinney . As he cut the pack , the judge motioned to Brown , meaning : Probe further . " Well ? " Brown persisted . " Does Fetterman still expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as he dealt he looked steadily , through narrowed eyes , at the quartermaster . " They know , " Brown said impatiently . " Everyone knows . " " Jacks or better , " Bisbee said . And he said no more . But his hand trembled as he passed out the cards . And when the hands were played out , he spoke . " He writes that Fort Phil Kearny is the talk of all the West , " he said bitterly . " He writes that his own men are asking how long the Colonel will suffer the regiment to be humiliated without striking back . " " As long as he commands the regiment ! " Brown cried.  | " And how long will that be ? " White asked . " Until they realize in Washington that we and the Indiansare at war . " " And what will make them  --  " " Quiet ! " said Kinney . " Quiet ! " He turned again to Bisbee . " What else does he write ? " Bisbee 's chest heaved like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke . " He writes that the officers who pass through Sedgwick want to know if the EighteenthInfantry has developed a yellow streak ! " " Not the regiment , " Brown protested . " Just its commanding officer . " Kinney glanced at Brown and back to Bisbee 's fingers , whitening as they gripped the edge of the table . He asked gently : " What does Fetterman tell them ? " Bisbee looked at each of the three men . " You promise not to tell ? " " On my honor ! " Kinney swore . " He has told them that he will be here by the end of October ! " " The Colonel will never entrust him with the fort , " Brown cried . " He 'll never give him a free hand ! " " The Colonel can not make a coward of Fetterman , " Bisbee said ; his eyes were bright . " He has sworn that within sixty days of his arrival he will have wiped out the stain upon the regiment 's good name ! " The three men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered in the winnings on the table . It seemed a good time to end the game , and since the Reverend 's pile was the smallest , Brown and Kinney motioned to him to make the first move .

" Kinney asked as he sorted out coins and beans . " Brave man for a noncombatant ; very careless of life ; traveled alone and unarmed . . . " God knows , " Brown murmured , " how he survived as long as he did . " " The Indians took him for a Mormon , so Bridger says . He says the Indians and the Mormons do n't harm each other .

" And , besides , who knows what is the truth ? " He motioned to White . " You were saying ? " " Killed instantly , " White repeated . " No savage torture , his many friends will be relieved to know . All the customaryphrases . " " His many friends , " Kinney mused . He pocketed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling for an idea .

" " Who will you write to , then ? " " To Frank Leslie 's . He called himself a correspondent for the Weekly . " " I 'll wager Leslie never even heard of him , " Brown cried . " That does n't matter , " Kinney said . " They 'll print the notice if it gives them prestige . " Leslie 's is an influential journal , " Kinney continued . " Hundreds of thousands of people read it in the States . " He looked around the table . " The right kind of obituary , " he said , " could help to awaken our Eastern friends to conditions as they exist in the territories . " " Yes , " he repeated . " An influential weekly . " He watched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamp . " Tell them , " he said , " that we are in a state of Indianwar , and have been since the middle of July . Tell them we are doomed to a formidable Indian war . " FORT PHIL KEARNY , September 20When Adair learned of Glover 's death , he smiled . He was pleased that his powers should be thus confirmed . Glover pretended to be my friend , he said to himself ; under guise of friendship he wormed my secrets from me . And then he deserted me . He said he was going to live with the wood choppers , but I knew that he was lying ; I couldp247read his mind . He was going to betray my secrets to the Indians . And although I felt sorry for him , it became necessary for me to eliminate him . Adair entered a vigorous plea to be entrusted with Glover 's camera . For he had come to see that the camera was a malevolent force . Turning the eye of the camera upon a man , Adair had realized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will to resist . Adair himself had been made the victim of this treatment . If I am less of a man now than when I came here , he said to himself , it is partly because he turned the camera upon me and took a part of me and transferred it to a glass plate . Just who was behind Glover in all his plots Adair had not determined , but in any case he did not want the eye of the camera regarding him as he moved around the fort . He pleaded to be given the property of his dead friend , and naturally his plea was granted . Yet , once he gained possession of the camera , he could not quite remember why it had seemed so important . He left it lying in the dirt outside his tent . For three days following Glover 's death Adair seemed cheerful and confident . His bearing was stiff , almost rigid ; his commands were crisp ; his mind was alert . Even his appetite improved ; he cleaned his plate of mush three times each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unforeseen event occurred . A cricket forewarned by the autumnal air crept into Adair 's tent and took up residence beneath his bed . It was a bright day , a fine day for Adair . His company was attentive ; ideas kept flowering in his mind . It came to him , for example , that the Post Council of Administrationhad not been convened in the manner prescribed by paragraph 93 of the Revised Army Regulations . And when he went to post headquarters to protest in writingp248against this breach of military propriety , the Colonel expressed his appreciation and mentioned again that Adair would soon be eligible for his captaincy . Well satisfied , Adair returned to his tent at the end of the day . He took off his jacket and boots ; he lay back on his cot and closed his eyes . Captain Adair , he said to himself over and over , CaptainAdair . The words lulled him toward sleep ; he was all but asleep when from close by a voice spoke to him . It said , quite clearly : murd ; murderer ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring up . For he understoodat once that the voice was accusing him and that the accusation was a trick , a means of trapping him into a false confession . It 's some friend of his , he decided , or a disloyal man in my company , a deserter or a Rebel sympathizer or even an agent of the Vatican . And now he is watching me and waiting to see what I will do . I will lie here . I will appear to take no notice . So he lay taut and motionless , staring at the canvas ceiling . And soon the thin , high-pitched voice spoke again : murd ; murderer ; murderer ; murd . I hear you . With the greatest stealth Adair raised his head . He looked around his white cell , but his adversary was cunning . He was well hidden , and he kept silent . Very well : Adair lay back and closed his eyes . He pretended to sleep , although his heart pounded within his chest . He thinks he can outwait me , but I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his cot . And after twenty minutes the voice said monotonously : murd ; murderer ; murderer ; murd . . . Liar ! Adair sprang up . Liar ! Liar ! He flung himself around the tent , overturning the cot and the chairs . Liar ! He threw blankets and clothing into the air . Liar ! Liar ! He emptied out duffel bags and foot-lockers . Liar ! He ransacked every place where an enemy , however small ,  |p249might  hide . But his adversary was more cunning than he had suspected . He had taken the precaution of making himself invisible . Cunning , cunning liar ! Adair stood panting in the centerof his cell . " Come out ! " he cried . " I dare you ! " But his adversary was too cunning . He crouched in his hiding place , and after a time Adair slumped down upon his cot . He lay with his face against the canvas wall . I will shut him out , he decided , and he forced two fingers deep into his ear drums . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work his way in . Murderer , said the voice , so close that it seemed to come from within him . Murd ; murderer ; murderer ; murd . It spoke in an even rasp , rubbing each word . Adair shivered ; he shook ; he wanted to wrap his head in somethingthick , a blanket or a towel . He wanted to draw his head down into his body as a turtle would , but his head was too big . So he lay exposed and defenseless . He could not even cry out in protest . He tried ; his lips moved , but instead of sound an angry taste filled his mouth , a dark taste , the taste of blood , his own blood filling his throat and his mouth , choking him . He tried to cough or to swallow ; he could not . He lay gasping for breath and writhing , and as he writhed straps were passed over and under him , binding him down to his bed , until he could not move his feet or his legs or his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He lay pinioned and he knew that he was bound down to an operating table and that his adversarywas preparing to dismember him . There came to him the hospital smells , chloroform and carbolic acid and damp towels and old blood and gangrene . He begged for mercy and no one heeded his begging . Tears streamed down his cheeks ; no kind hand brushed them away . Murderer ; murd . . . The voice was a voice-saw rasp/ing across his thigh . Ah , Adair cried , it will drain all the blood from my body ! He summoned his failing powers and forbade his blood to flow to his leg . And his blood obeyed , like water turned off at a tap . His leg shrank withoutthe blood ; it grew hollow like a hose or a pipe . A hose leg , he thought , a pipe leg with a tap for . . . Murd ; murderer ; murderer . . . The voice was a bit and brace grinding into the soft spot at the base of his skull where the bullet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back as far as it could go , and farther . He winced as the blade cut , scraping , scoring , spiraling into his head . His skull , his iron-plated skull resisted , but his brains were soft and spongy . And hard in that mass a ball revolved , a hot ball , a bullet . They lied to me , he cried , they never took the bullet out ! The ball spun furiouslylike a dark sun , and two fingers , two pincers like spider 's jaws , probed into that fiery orbit . His head swelled ; it grew molten ; red and yellow patterns flamed around him . Then the smell of chloroform overpowered him ; the pad smothered him , mastered him , and he surrendered , went down and under , crying I give in ! I give in ! And when it was over he lay weeping without tears and left for dead until dim figures moved over him . They lifted him ; his cot began to rock like a cradle or a stretcher and he was carried along beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his burdens . And though he was wounded , he felt no pain . He felt at peace and lay watching the cedars glide past him until in the night of the forest the stretcher bearer turned and laid him on the ground and bent over and shook him . Protestingweakly , Adair opened his eyes and saw his orderly . Adair sat staring at the mush his orderly had brought him , seeing nothing , feeling nothing , a consciousnessp251without a will , a body without a being , borne along beneathgreat combers and tossed up on an unknown shore . At last , when the sweat on his body grew cold , he shivered . His mind was too weary to reach out for the thoughts that lay waiting around him ; his arms were too remote and too heavy to respond to his command . Yet anxiety mounted within him , for the danger that had overpowered him and almost destroyed him threatened him still . He worked his way , painfully , laboriously , toward the thought that would serve as a trap door , a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay here , he said to himself . I must get away . I must leave this place . I must resign my commission . I must persuade the Colonel to let me resign . I must write out a letter , a military letter , stating the reasons why I must resign . To the Commanding Officer , he wrote  --  for he rememberedclearly the form that he must follow . To the Commanding Officer , Mountain District ; Sir : I. Though I honor my commission and would dearly love to help you hold your fortress wrested in the wilderness from the fleet-footed savages by gallantsoldiers even as a few swift flying years ago in merrie England where great grim Caesar the Javelin darter took his shield-covered Romans to that Isle of Beauty I must needs resign. 2 . I am not what I was . I had rather not come to your city or citadel but was forced , for the sake of Lucre . For no one , Bishop or beggar can bravely live or bedridden except by Lucre , cruel Lucre . Yea truly one may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleadings of a lute but even a manystringedlute must be the purchase of much usedp252Lucre yea even filthy Lucre and swift-footed darting Time can likewise be had only by a large well securedamount of the filthy Lucre . Or else my once ne'er so bold light stepping warrior verily must needs be shot away and no unrigged time be had to caper very nimbly in a lady 's chamber . Adair ended there . He read the request over and signed it : J. J. Adair , 1st Lt. i8th U.S. Infantry . The Colonel will endorse it , he said to himself , because it is full of learning and the Colonel is a man of learning , and he respects me as a Man of Learning . Refined , the Colonel wrote on my application for a commission , a refined and curious refinery . When Adair was awakened by his orderly on the following morning , he felt extremely calm . He felt encased in calm ; it moved with him and around him like an envelope , shielding him from the nameless anxiety that lay beyond its borders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immense and supernatural force had overpoweredand all but destroyed him . He resolved to think no more about it . He knew exactly what he had to do . His only moment of indecision came when he read over his letter to the Colonel . For , while the letter was clear and convincing , he doubted if the Colonel , for all his education , was intelligent enough to understand the argument . I shall have to simplify it , he decided . I shall have to say simply : I hereby tender my resignation forthwith . " I hereby tender . . . " Rehearsing the sentence , he marched over and into the headquarters tent . Carrington was working at his desk when Adair entered . He looked up , and Adair said quickly : " I hereby tender my resignation forthwith . "  | " Your resignation ? " Carrington was shocked . " You are resigning ? " " Forthwith . I hereby tender  --  " " Your commission in the Army ? You must be ill ! " " No , " Adair said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I hereby tender  --  " " You are under strain . The death of your friend has  --  " " No , " Adair said . " No . " The man is talking nonsense , he said to himself ; I have no friend . " Something is weighing heavily on your mind . " " Yes , " Adair said  --  yes , for a change . And : heavily , he thought . Iron is heavy . And lead is heavy . Flesh is lighter . " Your family , perhaps ? " And wind is the lightest of all . Adair smiled . For , light as the wind and blown by Carrington 's remark , a host of family reasons fluttered into the tent . " Yes , " he said . " My family has sent for me . My mother and my sisters sent for me , " he added with increasing conviction . " They all sent for me . " " Where are they ? " " East of the Mississippi . " " They need you urgently ? " " Forthwith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is their reason ? " Adair was silent for some time . Then he said sullenly : " I am not permitted to divulge the reason . " " It must be important . " " If it were not important , I would not give up the honorable post I hold . " Carrington looked up sharply . " If you must go , " he said , " then go for a month . Settle your family affairs and return as quickly as you can . " " I can not . " " Why not ? "  |p254Adair  thought for a moment and remembered with relief a far-off snowfall . Snow is what you put under sleds to make them run , he thought . They run all the way downhill and all you have to do is sit there , laughing . But pulling them uphill again is tiring and tedious . " Because of the snow , " he said . " The snow ? " Carrington looked closely into the young man 's expressionless face . There is something strange about him , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he remains a soldier , and no soldier , no true soldier , can be indifferent to the call of patriotism . " I respect your sense of duty to your family , " he said . " I do not question your family 's need of you . Yet as your Colonel I must remind you of your greater duty to your country , and of your country 's need of you . Now , when there is fighting all along . . . He stopped short , for Adair was smiling . You can fight with snowballs , Adair was thinking , and the longer you hold them the harder they get . And once in Erie County . . . He shivered and humped his shoulders , rememberinghow his elder sisters had held him and stuffed the cold snow down the back of his neck . Carrington checked his anger , remembering that this young man whom he had brought into the Army had sufferedfour grave wounds in his country 's service , one of them in his head . " Try to understand my position , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battalion to guard a territory four hundred miles in length . And of the seventeen officers who belong to the battalion , seven are now absent and unavailable . " " I hereby tender my  --  " " I am ordered to build and to maintain four forts along the road . One I have had to abandon for lack of officers and men . The second , at Reno , has only two officers left.  |p255The  third , Fort Smith , has three officers , including CaptainProctor  --  " " I hereby  --  " " I had not heard from Captain Proctor for five weeks . This morning I learn that he has lost his sanity . And I have no officers to replace him . " I  --  " " My fourth post , this post , has seven officers in all . We seven command the district , the regiment , the battalion , and the post . " He looked up . " Can you fairly talk of resigningand leaving six ? " " I hereby tender my resignation forthwith . " The anger and resentment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean nothing to you ! " he cried rising . " Does your regiment mean nothing ! Does the oath you took mean nothing ! " His anger mounted as he spoke , for it struck him that Adair , like the rest of the regiment , was exploiting his good nature and misusing his kindheartedness . " It was I who picked you from the ranks to be an officer ! " he cried . " It was I who secured your promotion in wartime ! It was I who signed your request for a permanent commission when you had no other supporters ! And now when your regiment and your Colonel need you most , you repay them with indifference ! Pure selfishness ! Neither country , nor Colonel , nor  --  " " Forthwith , I hereby tender my  --  " " And I hereby reject your tender  --  forthwith ! You will remain on duty here until reinforcements arrive , or at least until you can present some compelling reason why  --  " " Shot away , " Adair whispered . " Half of me is shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you are too ill to carryp256out your duties , he will put you up for a medical discharge . " That is all . " Carrington added when Adair failed to speak . He stared at the lieutenant , waiting for him to salute . Adair saluted and walked away . Carrington turned back to his papers . Gradually a troubled conscience worked its way up through his anger . He called his wife to his side . He spoke of his rejection of Adair 's request . He asked : " Did I act rightly ? " " You acted as you had to , " she said . " But you can not rely upon Adair from now on . " " What am Ito do ? " " You no longer have any choice . You must send for Fetterman . " " I do n't trust him ! God knows what he may do once he gets control of the battalion ! " " Without him you will have no battalion . " She is right , he told himself when his wife had returned to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost to me ; Brown 's affairs are in chaos ; Ten Eyck is drinkinghimself to death ; and now Adair is acting strangely . Nothing is in place any longer . But Fetterman . . . Carrington saw before him thep257handsome , faintly sullen face of the captain  --  captain and lieutenant colonel , thanks to this accursed system of awarding brevet rank for action in the face of the enemy . If it were not for that system , he thought , my lineal rank would command the respect that it deserves among my junior officers . As it is , Captain Fetterman will chafe when he gets a company under Ten Eyck . He will find causes to agitate about . It would n't matter if Tenedore had the post in hand . But the fact is the men do as they like , while he drinks and dozes . Should I give Fetterman the command ? He has the rank ; yet he acts without a moment 's reflection . He has the experience ; he lacks the ability to see beyond the day . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They fail to see that boldness is only a part of heroism , and that intelligence is the larger part . They take it for granted that boldness is the only military virtue  --  one without a limit . They can not understand that every virtue , if it is pressed beyond its limits , becomes a deadly vice . For all that , he is far superior to Tenedore  --  above all , in war . If war is forced upon us , he would bring renown to the battalion and success to our enterprise . But we are not yet at war . All our activity is directed to the avoidanceof a general war . Would Fetterman accept that objective ? He is devoted to the battalion , of course  --  but not to me . He owes nothing to me . No doubt he assumes , as the rest do , that I left the battalion by choice . Why must they hold fast to that error ? Because I am a man of learning , I suppose , and they take it for granted that no man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Carrington closed his eyes in weariness . He rested upon his desk , one given to him by friends in New Eng/land in commemoration of his service in the abolitionist cause . Once , seated before it , he had felt his hand guided by convictions as solid as the desk itself as he wrote out his addresses on the necessity of taking up arms to save the Union and freedom . Now he was buffeted by conflictingvoices : If I bring Fetterman to the fort , he will stand against me as a man of action . Act yourself , then , before he comes ! You always longed to lead your troops in battle . Lead them now ! I lack the weapons . I lack the provocation . The Army will give you all you need , once you attack . Hazen himself told you that the Sioux deserve a thrashing . For defending their rights ? Rights are a presumption . Duties are governing ; your duties . To the Indians ? To them as much as to your own people ; to civilize them ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of arms ? Arms saved the Union . You swore , when it was threatened , that the shedding of blood was a mere contingency in the struggle . It was forced upon us ; we could not escape history . You can not escape it now . I came here to guard the peace . Go back , then ! Resign your command and return to the East . And leave the men who followed me here ; who stand with me now , against the odds ? Whatever happens to them , your conscience will be clear.  |p259I  can not leave them ; of all surrenders , that would be the worst . " I can not ! " he repeated aloud . He roused himself ; he wrote out two Orders : the first establishing new and rigid rules of discipline at Fort Phil Kearny ; the second transferring to the fort Captain and Brevet Lieutenant Colonel William Judd Fetterman . FORT PHIL KEARNY , September 23Special Order Seventy-five was Carrington 's answer to the indiscipline that flourished at the fort . The fastenings of all gates must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general alarm or appearance of Indians in force or near the gates , the same will be closed , and no soldier or citizenwill leave the fort without orders . . . . In no case shall there be needless running in haste upon an alarm . Shouting , tale-bearing and gross perversion of facts by excited men does more mischief than Indians . And , the duty of guards being to advise of danger , soldiers who have information must report to the proper officer , and not to comrades . . . . Discipline , the Colonel supposed , would be regained by the Order . And it might have been , had not the Order contained one human flaw . Three of the four keys to the gates were to be held by the district commander , the post commander , and the officer of the day ; the fourth was entrusted to the quartermaster , Captain Brown.  |p260Brown  paused by the bulletin board , where a cluster of soldiers studied the Order . He read it and chuckled . He nudged Bowers , who stood beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the metallic jingle . " Watch for me , " Brown murmured . Then he entered his office and started again on the foredoomed task of producing a balanced inventory of the Quartermaster 's Property on Hand . . . . Acid , nitric , lbs . 19 ; Aloes , lbs . zero ; and I 'm charged with six pounds of aloes . Alum , ditto 66 ; Aqua amana , botts r6 ; and I 'm charged with twenty-three . Who the hell has been stealing the aqua amana ? Asafoetida , lbs . 30 ; and I 'm charged with thirty-six . Ah , to hell with the asafoetida ! He pushed his chair back and moved to the doorway ; he regarded the day . A bright day in the east ; a hot day in prospect , with the last of the hay to bring in . But to the west above the peaks great clouds swelled and darkened ; thunder grumbled in the mountains . Brown grinned , guessing that the storm would bring raiders . Returning , he laid his revolvers on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Bolsters 192 . Brown checked his revolvers . The Indians , he decided , will be hiding with their horses in the brush along the Little Piney . They will strike when the storm hits the fort . They will steal Chandler'sherd because his is the largest and the easiest to run off . They 'll drive the herd east , running for the badlands . We 'll take the east gate and turn them at the lake . We 'll pick up the miners as we go . . . . Brushes , house , 90 . The horses are saddled , I know . But how about the pony ? The boy must be riding him somewhere . Do . Paint , 4 . No time to change saddles ; I 'll ride him with just the blanket . Do . Whitewash , 20 . Horses whinnied beyond the stockade . Are they coming ?  |p261A  bell clanged , the bell mare wheeling among the mules ; all of them are excited by the storm , he thought , and ready to be stampeded . Buckets , water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the papers on the table . Do . Tar 32 . If the pony 's caught out in the storm . . . Do . Gutta Percha , 15 . The numbers wavered under his trembling hand . Do . . . . Damn the Does ! He thrust the revolvers into his holsters and moved again to the doorway . The last of the laundry flapped wildly in the high wind . Dust twisted upward in ropes , sucked into the darkening sky . Men hurried everywhere for shelter . In the west the mountain wall was hidden by a white shield of hail . The savages will be mounted now , he decided , and moving in the brush , still concealed . And nowhere the Colonel ; nowhere the officer of the day ; no body of men held in readiness ! So much the better , Brown thought . The eight horses waited , saddled , by the stables . And from the barracks , where he too watched and waited , Bowers signaled : Ready . Brown nodded , and the first bullet of hail stung his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ? The hail struck hard against the west side of the stockade and came bouncing off the parade ground . From behind the sutler 's store the pony raced , head low , reins loose , the boy clinging to his neck . Brown rushed out , seized the bridle , and lifted Carrington 's son from the saddle . " Run to your mother ! " he cried . But the boy stood there , shivering . " Calico , " he mumbled , " Calico . . . " Brown lifted the boy up and laughed and slapped a buttock as he set him back on the ground . " Run along , " he said , " and when the sun comes out , I 'll bring you some candy ! " Cold rain followed hard on the hail . Half sheltered by his tent , Brown stripped the child 's saddle from the pony and laid the blanket over its barreled back . " Little devil , "  |p262he  murmured , " game little devil ! " He brushed the sodden mane . " Best-fed little devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be while there 's an ear of corn left in my stores ! " The pony rubbed its wet head against his holster and nuzzled in his pocket . High on the west wall of the stockade a sentry shouted , fired , shouted again . Through the din of the hail beating on the tent roof Brown heard the yells of the Indians , the neighing of the horses , the crack of the fence giving way as they stampeded , the crashing in the brakes and bushes as the raiders drove them down into the river bottom . Brown straddled the pony . He yanked its neck over and kicked its hard belly . From the barracks Bowers and his squad sprinted for the stables . " The Order , " the stablehandprotested , " the Order says  --  " " Follow me ! " Brown shouted . " No one 's supposed  --  " began the guard at the east gate . Brown thrust him aside and forced the gate wide . Dim through the hail he saw the herd streaming up the slopes on the far side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rode around them , urging them on . " Hurry ! " Brown shouted , waving his soldiers past . Bent low in their saddles and lashing their mounts , they gallopedthrough the gate . Down the embankment and over the flat Brown hammered off after them , the pony poundingalong on its short , stout legs . The storm swept out over the badlands , trailing its purplegarments . Sunlight embraced the fort ; the morning air was washed and clean and still . From their places of shelter the soldiers re-emerged , glancing upward . And since it was Sunday morning , Chaplain White took over the parade ground , directing the squad of soldiers in the placing of the chairs for morning service while the ladies laid out the hymnbooks.  |p263Carrington  was troubled . His first impulse on learning of Brown 's pursuit of the raiders was to send out more men as reinforcements , but the sally had been made in defianceof his Order , and to support it would amount to an endorsement of a breach of discipline . He returned to his desk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wavered between the urge to maintain his authority and his desire to safeguard the lives of the men under his command . At last he ordered Bisbee to ride out with a mounted company , but when the company lined up for inspection , he countermanded the order . Several times he stood at the doorway of his tent and listened , thinking that he had heard a far-off exchange of fire . But no sounds reached him on the tranquil air . The bell tolled for the service ; the garrison gathered beneath the pulpit White had fashioned . Carrington took his place with his wife and sons in the front row . He knelt and prayed at once for the safe return of his men . He led in singing the hymns and listened in outward reverence to the chaplain 's sermon . White had seized upon a new text for his sermon in commemoration of Brown and his men . " He that fleeth of them , ' " he intoned , " shall not flee away , and he that escapeth of them shall not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine hand take them ; though they climb up to heaven , thence will I bring them down : And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel  --  ' " he pointed to the distant buttes  --  " ' l will search and take them out thence ; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea , thence will I command the serpent , and he shall bite them : And though they go into captivity . . . ' " White 's voice rose as he extolled the absentsoldiers , stirring all the congregation save the man whose Order they had defied . I should have sent the re/lief party after them , Carrington told himself , and now I can not until the service is over . Every moment that passed added to his torment , and yet to the chaplain the passing of time had shed its significance . He droned on , and by the time the last amen was sung , Carrington 's fear had faded and with it his resolution . The slow , sweet afternoon brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ridge and down the VirginiaCity road a mournful column came  --  an officer and escort in the lead , and behind them the hay party with all its carts and machinery . For three days the workershad been under attack on Goose Creek . Now , worn down and demoralized , they were returning with empty carts , and for good . Three of their hay carts had been burned ; four of their men were wounded . And in the last of their wagons they brought three bodies unknown to them , for burial . Carrington looked down upon the bodies . He recognizedin the disfigured remains a contractor and two teamsters whom he had sent north under heavy escort with supplies for his new outpost , Fort C. F. Smith . He listened as the officer told the now familiar story of comingupon a desolate scene of burned-out wagons and abandoned goods . The survivors , the officer believed , had fled for Smith , leaving their dead . The Indians , he was certain , numbered four hundred or more . That , he added , was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early victory over the Indians , " he concluded , " there wo n't be a citizen left who will work out of sight of the fort . " Carrington returned to his tent and wrote out a report upon the incident for General Cooke in Omaha . He read it over , shaking his head . For a month now , he thought , I have sent nothing but discouraging news to the general :  |p265soon  he must lose confidence in my command . And if tomorrow I must report the deaths of my quartermaster and his party . . . I should have sent out a party , he told himself once again . And now it is too late ; there are only two hours of daylight left . If they fail to come in by nightfall , he decided , then tomorrow morning I shall ride out myself to recover the bodies . He thought with sorrow of the many evenings when Fred Brown had enlivened the company by his laughter . At that moment Wands came to report that the sentry on Pilot Hill had signaled that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later Carrington stood with his officers staring at the base of Pilot Hill . Around its slow curve a welcomeprocession plodded into view : the bell mare led by a weary rider ; the herd , strung out behind her , some moving steadily , some trotting , pausing to tear at the tufts of prairie grass , and trotting on again . And behind the herd the horsemen : three soldiers riding guard on the herd ; four more remounted and leading wounded horses ; fifteen miners slumped in their saddles , their reins hangingloose ; and in the center Brown on the dappled pony , his legs hanging almost to the ground . Tears of relief blurred Carrington 's vision . He turned aside to brush them away and then pressed the binoculars again to his eyes . He saw now that Brown was leading a riderless horse , a horse with an Army saddle . He saw slung over the saddle like a dead deer a body , a white man 's body . One man lost , then ; which one ? The miners dropped out by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mare off to the left around the fort . Silently and majestically Brown led the rest of his little army up the embankment and through the gate that he had unlocked in the morning . As a crowd gathered , he stepped off the pony and stretched . Then , mov/ing down the lead rein , he lugged the dead man off his horse and flung him like a sack of meal onto the ground . The body lay there face downward . As the crowd closed in , Brown flipped it over with one boot . A bitter face stared sightless at the evening sky . The crowd voiced its confusion , and Brown , still with his boot , forced open one clenched fist , exposing four fingers and a stump for a thumb . " One more dead Rebel , " he said . That evening by lamplight Carrington wrote his first hopeful report in weeks to General Cooke . When it was completed , he summoned Brown to his tent and read it aloud . " Apprending a hostile movement early Sunday morningduring a storm the garrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He read on , unaware of Brown 's smile. . . dashed into Contractor Chandler 's herd , drivingoff 94 head . Upon their appearance Captain Brown with a party of mounted men and fifteen miners who volunteered dashed out of the east gate and after a pursuit of thirteen miles overtook the Indians and fought them for an hour . ' " He looked up . " It was thirteen miles ? " Brown , still smiling , nodded . Carrington continued : " At one time the whole party was surrounded . Dismounting the cavalry , Captain Brown and a few men charged the Indians with revolvers , killing five Indians and one white man ; I think Bob North who has led them in every case , and woundingsixteen . ' " " We crippled sixteen , " Brown interrupted . " We nicked another score . " Carrington read on : " One chief carried from the field by his men wore an elaborate feather head-dressp267and ornaments upon his person . They retired to a high hill silently and without their usual bravado . They felt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the fort . It has inspired my men with new cour-age . ' " With new courage , " he repeated . He laid the dispatch aside and looked up . " Are you satisfied ? " Brown 's smile shrank . He advanced toward Carrington and leaned across the desk . " Something else happened out there today , " he said . " It was n't part of the skirmish , so I left it out of my report . " " Well ? " Carrington glanced up anxiously . " We cleared up the mystery of what happened to Gilchrist and Johnson . We were heading home when we came across them  --  or what was left of them . There was n't enough to bring back for a decent burial . " Carrington was confused . " Wolves ? " he began . " The raw flesh of humans is too salty for them . " " It was n't raw . They 'd been roasted  --  over a slow fire . " Carrington looked up , unbelieving . " The charred wood and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Indians took their time . You ask me if I 'm satisfied , " Brown repeated when Carrington failed to speak . " Well , I 'm not ! But I 'll tell you when I will be satisfied . " He stood up , looking north toward Lodge Trail Ridge . " I 'll be satisfied on the day that I nail Red Cloud 's scalp to my door ! "  |p268At  the end of September the earth ceased to work for the garrison . The days became colorless and chill . Snow fell in earnest in the mountains , driving the elk downwardand the bear underground . The horizons closed in around the half-finished fort until late on an indefinable day the snow took shape and settled , dimming all distance , deadening all sound . The snowfall moved on as mysteriously as it had arrived . The ceiling lifted : by midnight the plains were pale and marvelously clear beneath the moon . And every distantsound was keen : geese , flying south by night , called out and were answered from the lake ; wolves howled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls , watching each shape that moved or seemed to move . For the Sioux loved to kill by moonlight . They howled like wolves ; they crept close to the fort , concealed in wolfskins . More than one sentry had fallen when , without warning , a wolf reared up , bristling with arrows . At five in the morning the bugles sounded Reveille . At six the garrison , spurred by the twist of the earth toward winter , went swiftly to work . By seven the timber train with its escort of cavalry was winding up the trail to the pinery ; the sawmills were screeching ; the soldiers were busy hewing , pointing , placing timbers for the last of the stockade walls ; even the sentries down from night watchp269worked on , knowing that from now on they faced two enemies in place of one . At nine the new guard formed . Led by the band , it set out across the parade ground , circling the snow fort built and now stoutly defended by the Carrington boys and Bobby Wands . Grinning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strains of " The Bowld Sojer Boy " and the shouts , the bugle sounded the Alarm . The bandsmen halted and broke , running for their rifles . The soldiers massed in squads . From their tents Margaret Carrington and Jennie Wands rushed out . They captured the snow fort and hustled its defenders off into captivity indoors . At the entrance to his headquarters Carrington stood , searching for the raiders . Another false alarm , he thought , for surely . . . Hearing the faint unearthly yell , he turned and saw a band of Indians urging their ponies up a claw of Pilot Hill . Cut off and confused , the sentries on the hilltop stood holding their horses , ready to bolt . The relief party rattled off through the east gate  --  not in time . No riders could save the sentries now . But on the parade ground a mountain howitzer squatted , ugly as an iron frog . It was Carrington 's special weapon ; he calculated time , distance , and elevation as he ran ; he cut his fuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It burst over the Indians , breaking up their purpose . Their ponies reared and stumbled ; one warrior slid from his saddle and lay on the ground ; another wheeled and scooped him up ; they fled back to their hiding places in the river bottom . Carrington returned to his desk . Brown also turned back from his doorway , where he had watched the action with mounting scorn . He stared at the papers on his desk : the still unfinished inventoryp270of quartermaster 's property , and yesterday 's mail : a letterfrom Toledo with its long-awaited , horribly ironic enclosure : You are hereby informed that the President of the United States has appointed you to the brevet rank of Captain . And with the scroll the letter , the spindly writing on the stationery of robin's-egg blue . Fred dear , his mother explained , when this notice arrived last month I wrote off at once to Senator Trumbull . I said I knew there must have been some mistake because you are a captain already and they should have made you at least a major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been given more if you were not so far away in the West . Senator Trumbull wrote back and he was most courteous . But he said that the Board had dispersedand the papers had all been sent off and he was very sorry but there was nothing he could do . I know that he tried dear and I feel that it 's such a shame . Your ever lovingWrenches , he wrote ; Monkey Nos. 12 . . . Bastards , he said to himself , stupid , heartless bastards , living in luxury in Washington , fawning on each other . What do they care if a man risks his life day after day against the enemy out on the plains a thousand miles from nowhere ? Twelve stupid monkey wrenches , and there should be thirteen . And I 'm responsible ! I recover a herd worth ten thousand : I kill ten savages in a day 's battle , and those bastards come whining back that a monkey wrench is missing . I 'll show them , he thought ; I 'll wring my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill every Indianin Dakotah with my own bare hands ! I 'll . . . He looked out over the stockade to the untroubled hills . Damned howitzer , damned damned howitzer , spitting its black gob from a safe distance , a fine weapon for cowards to use ! If I had taken that relief party out , we'dp271be on them by now ; we 'd have bagged eight or ten , with any luck . But the Colonel fires his loathsome howitzer , and now , because one fool falls off his pony , he sits in there with his chest puffed out , thinking himself a hero . And now the Indians will hold off for the rest of the day . He was mistaken . As the relief party rode in , the sentriesshouted again , pointing north to the high distance . There , in the grand manner of Sheridan and his cavalry , a much larger column of warriors rode rapidly but withouthaste along the slope of Lodge Trail Ridge . All work ended in the fort . The soldiers gathered , muttering , arguing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once again men 's lives turned on the swiftnessand soundness of Carrington 's decision . He turned upon his post commander , demanding : " What are you going to do ? " But it was no use . Ten Eyck choked up with resentment , and the mood of the crowd around them grew more intolerant . Carrington ordered fifty infantrymenoff on the double ; they formed and lumbered away . But as they panted up the trail , the superior instinct of the Indians was demonstrated once again . High up in the rocks and ridges lights flashed  --  mirrors held against the sun and twisted by the watchman of the Sioux . At their signals the column of warriors halted , and then in the most leisurely manner turned and moved off over the ridge . The troops pressed on for half a mile or more . Then back down the trail they jogged , out of breath and out of patience , frustrated and ready to take their frustrationout upon the first available symbol of the enemy . The enemy : at midday nine Cheyennes of Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hill : Little Moon , Dull Knife , Pretty Bear , Red Arm , Brave Soldier , The Rabbit That Jumps , The Wolf That Liesp272Down , The Man That Stands Alone on the Ground  --  names rich in valor , but the lances of the chiefs were lowered ; their ponies were gaunt ; their robes and saddle blankets were threadbare ; the travois of the lone squaw who rode behind them scarcely sagged beneath its meager load . They rode silently , wasting no word or motion . They stared upward to the tiny fortress perched on Pilot Hill . Once again the flag flapped there as they watched ; it signaledconvulsively ; it fell as the sentries fled . Indian warriors appeared on the stone redoubt . Waving the flag and dancing , they taunted the garrison until a party of soldiers rode out to drive them off . They remounted their ponies and raced down the long slope  --  Sioux , bright in their war paint , bent upon violence . The Cheyenneshalted . Patiently they awaited their punishment . The Sioux came charging up : young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high fever by the raid upon the redoubt and ready to cut down the Cheyennes now that the sentries had slipped out of their trap . " Dogs ! " they cried , riding in among the once great warriors . " Halfbreeds ! Mothers of Crows ! " With their bows they whipped and lashed the Cheyennes , slashing their faces , cursing them for cowards . Knives were next but for the whisp of bullets . A spatter of rifle fire reminded the Sioux of their pursuers . They kicked their mounts and galloped away southward . Looking up , the Cheyennes saw poundingdown the Bozeman Trail a company of blue-coated cavalry led by a bald and bearded officer on a dappled pony . Brown drew his revolver and fired at the Cheyennes as he rode . He had seen them mingling with the raiders , and , in any case , one dead Indian was as good as another . He emptied one Colt and was aiming the second **26;2131;TOOLONG this functioning friendship required concerted action from them all . Some members had spoken of outdoor excursionsas a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , excursions with a definite purpose in them , such as the identifying of mushrooms , or of wild birds in the early morning , or the study of astronomy at night under the stars . Some had suggested a course in German and American literature , with discussions in both languages , she said , while others had thought that musical instruments could give them a reason for being together , either in chamber-music groups or in an orchestra . Although she spoke with the greatest simplicity , there was confusion on the faces of many of the Germans , and they looked tentatively about them . The Herr Direktor of the Krankenhaus glanced at the Rektor Magnificus , and the Herr Oberburgermeister looked at the Colonel . The words that seemed to whisper through the rooms in query were " functioning friendship , " for the explanation for this was not in any book that they had read . " We hope that our new members here tonight will have other ideas and suggestions to make , " said CatherineRoberts , her voice grave . " After the speakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope that you will turn this gathering into an open forum , a town meeting in which everyone takes part . " By now it was clear that an interpreter was needed to make her words as well as the situation comprehensible . Jaeger had listened as he smoked , held by the vision of CatherineRoberts contained and armored in her aura of purity , but what her words meant he did not know , for he was not certain , even , that he knew what she had said . When he sought , at a later moment , to recall the color of her dress , he could not , for she appeared to drift on a soft wash of light , like Botticelli 's Venus on the wave . But now that the voices whispering for clarification could no longer be de/vied , he saw her waver , saw her green eyes seek her husband'seyes , and the Colonel , tossing in his seat , called Jaeger'sname aloud . " Hey , get up there and do some enucleating ! " he shouted , and at once the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own hand trembling as he threw his cigaretteaway . He stepped nearer to her , and as she spoke again of functioningfriendship , going back to the beginning and pronouncingthe words with care , each time he waited until she paused , and then he repeated the words in German to the assembled people . And now his flesh went hot with shame at the intimacy of this act which they performed in public together , for she would give him the words from her own mind and mouth , turning to look at him as she did so , and he would savor them for an instant , and then transform them to another sound upon his tongue . It was unbearable to him that they should be standing here on public view , exposing , before the words were quite pronounced , their understanding of each other 's speech . At moments , he felt the thoughts swoon in his head , for it was as if they stood up here before the Chaplain , and the Oberburgermeister , and the Rektor , and the countless witnesses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undo , and that they themselves were never to betray . The Rektor of the University was the next to speak , standing with shoulders as narrow and sloping as a bird 's , his long nose beaked and sorrowing . His hands were clasped out of sight under his rusty black tails , and he began to speak in German , saying that education was a highroad that all free men must share . American and German alike , he was saying , must walk together on this highroad as men had followedit in olden times out of the darkness of the barbaric ages ; and then the Colonel 's voice rang sharply out.  | " Speak English , Rector ! " he shouted , and the members of the German-American Club sat frozen on their chairs . " My English , " said the Rektor Magnificus in a halting voice , " is poor . I have not spoken in many years . " " Speak it anyway , " said Colonel Roberts , his shoulders casting the weight of his impatience from one side to the other . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in anothertongue , groping for words , lost in the labyrinth of structure , the beginning of each sentence nearly forgotten once he neared its end . His arms hung limply by his sides , and his eyes were glazed like those of a man who has been stricken . His beak and brow were as narrow as an ailing bird 's . He was saying , or he sought to say , that the German was emerging now , like barbaric man , from the long silence of modern German history , and the time had come for new legends of Beowulf to be sung . But his voice faltered as he spoke , and in a moment the blue underlid of the bird 's eye might rise to shutter from the others the mark of the blow the Colonel had dealt . He spoke of Goethe 's " Metamorphosisof Plants , " but whether any American seated there , or any German , except Jaeger , recognized the syllables oz followed the tortuous way he took , could not be known . " I would , but could I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell about the classification , the three types of changing  --  die Verwandlung  --  metamorphosis , " said the Rektor in a voice of indescribable pain . " I would speak ofthat classification Goethe exploded , expanded , into three  --  namely , progressive , we will say , and the backward , reversed , movement of progress  --  " " Retrogressive , " said the Herr Oberburgermeister deferentially . His accent was Oxford and assured , for who else in the room was entitled to put this word or any other into the Rektor 's mouth ?  | " Progressive , retrogressive , " the Rektor repeated , continuing to turn his " p 's " into " b 's " ; " and the third , namely , arbitrary . I would compare the three types of this changing proved by Goethe to the progression , the developmenting , of the German man like the universal plant . In ultimacy , this makes the mind turn to follow , if common men could dare , to the Urpflanze of Goethe . That is to say , that Germangenius proved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all plants  --  and in allegory might be charged all men  --  arrive from the Urpflanze  --  " " Could you make that a little clearer , Rector ? " Colonel Roberts called out . " Die Urpflanze , " said the Rektor bleakly , and he did not turn his head . " Urpflanze ! " the Herr Oberburgermeister cried out in a distressed whisper , his eyes as yellow as an owl 's and his ears as feathered . " Ach , Gott , I can not find the English equiva-lent  --  " " I think it is called the primitive plant , the prototype of all plants , that Goethe sought , " said Jaeger , leaning in uneasinessagainst the framework of the arch . " The way men sought the Holy Grail ? " Catherine Robertsasked from her seat beside the Herr Direktor of the Krankenhaus . " Ach , no , it was not religious . It was biological , " said the Herr Oberburgermeister , and he leaned forward to catch the Chaplain 's eye in confirmation . " Or would you say the mystic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at its source ? " " Well , that could very well be , " said the Chaplain , noddingpleasantly , as he , too , leaned forward in his chair . " All right , " said Colonel Roberts . " Now we know where we are . Let 's get on with it , Rector , " he said . The Rektor Magnificus spoke for twenty-three minutesp104by Jaeger 's watch , and when he was done and turned to take his seat again , he seemed to move unsteadily . For this was perhaps the evening he had thought of through the years , the night when , if he survived , he would speak in an official capacity to men who recognized his worth , and the light of their understanding would illuminate the darkness of all that he and others like him had endured . Had he not dreamed of tracing for them in his own tongue the metamorphosis of the German through Goethe 's theory of the metamophosisof the plant , not in exoneration of any German crimes , but to establish that the highly organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same , advancing a few evolutionarystages , and leaving behind his fellow man ? Had he not wished to stand humbly among his peers and say that all men proceed , some slowly , some more rapidly , from an identical root ? But now he had been stripped even of his modesty , deprived even of the arms of his learning and language , which were the only arms he had ever wished to bear . As he took his seat , his beak and his brow seemed to have gone narrower , and his eyes to merge as one cold , tearless eye above his nose . It was after ten when the speeches and the intervals of discussion were done with , with only Honerkamp and the Herr Oberburgermeister seeking to bring animation and logic to the scene . And then the guests saw with relief that the buffet tables were being spread anew in the hallway , and the zither and two violins again took up their complaint in the auditorium of the wide , soft night . The Americans began at once to drink , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of functioning friendship had ever interrupted these activities . And there were those among his countrymenhere , thought Jaeger , moving through them , who had certainly been invited only because they had the proper jackets to wear . It would have been highly impractical , hep105reflected sardonically , and the burdened dumb-waiter cried and groaned aloud in the hall , to plan a club whose membershad not been able to save jacket and tails or watered silk from the holocaust , no matter what courage or defiance marked their pasts . Matterhorn stumbled from room to room , setting the gilt-legged chairs against the wall , while the maids passed among the guests , bearing trays of Rhine wine in long-stemmed glasses , elaborately cut and colored emerald , and topaz , and blue . There is no reason for me to stay , thought Jaeger , and he put his notebook and pencil in his pocket as if putting away all hope for what the evening might have been ; and then Catherine Roberts stood close beside him , her face turned from him , but her hair like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would just go up to the second-floor library , " she was saying without seeming to speak , " I will come as quickly as I can . " Upstairs , before the dark , heavy , double doors , Jaeger knew this must be the entrance to the Bluebeard 's chamber that she had spoken of in the garden the first day . He turned the gun-metal knob , and the door swung out with the deliberationof a drawbridge descending , and he walked into the inner mystery and gloom , and the drawbridge closed behind him again . A lighted lamp with an opaque , bottlegreenshade stood on the library table in the obscurity , and out of the semi-darkness of the walls around sprang a white forest of roebuck skulls and stony horns , a petrified forest , it seemed , of bleached , desert residue as brittle as eggshell and intricately branched . Facing him was a massive fireplaceover which hung forty or more of these perishable cheekbones and brows , with their trim little sets of rugged horns ; and high above them was a heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wood , each head raised on the glossy , reddish , curved throat in separate fear of whatp106had stirred in the forest on that last flight . The heavy sprays of the antlers were rooted like iron in the fur-clad bone . This room must have served the brewer as retreat , thought Jaeger , for here no flavor of cabbage boiling hour after hour could permeate , and no sound of women 's voices could affront , speaking of lesser things than man 's concern . Nor could the voices of children who had grown now , or were dead , or who were held prisoner in another country , be heard from the terrace , or from the orchard , or from Wotan 's and Thor 's dark woodlands behind the house where they once had played . Below the roebuck skulls were shelves of books , dense as underbrush , but the worn , uncertain gilt of their titles gleamed here and there like the wary eyes of wild things in the dark . Other books stood upright between sober , iron bookends in the shape of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , one entitled in English Natural History , and , as he waited , he turned the pages in the lamplight , not wanting to look at the army of almost human skulls upon the walls . " The Harvest Mouse , " ran the headings ; " The Hamster , " " The Water Vole , " " The Lemming , " " The Agouti , " and there were illustrations of them ; " The Common Dormouse , " " The Jelerang , " " The Common Marmot , " and he stopped at the engraving on this page . For here , with each hair faithfully rendered , was the flattened head , the short arms on which coat sleeves seemed to hang too long , the protruding teeth , the small chin , of the man called Overstreet . The description ran : " Arctomys Marmota is a creature given to subterranean habits of life , digging large and rather complicated burrows . It is very common in all the mountainous districts of northern Europe where it associates in small societies . The hoary marmot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains of Idaho . The body is heavily and clumsily made , thep107head is large and flat , and the incisor teeth are extremely large and project beyond the lips . " Alaska , thought Jaeger , and out of the past came the echo of Dardenella 's voice , saying : " He 's lived too long in Alaska to know about thoroughbredsor the finer things of life . " He put the book back in its place , and he turned and looked at the heavy , double doors , over which three tusked boarheads hung . The evil snouts of the wild pigs might have been filled with breath still , for wet spittle seemed to bead the stiff , black leather of their lips , and the tilted , orange eyes were made of something more living than glass . And then one side of the heavy door below the boarheads opened , and Catherine Roberts came in . " Herr Jaeger , " she said , speaking softly . " It 's Milly . " Her eyes were lowered as if she could not bear the sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concave frontal bones , so young , so friable . " I thought you would n't mind coming with me . If you could walk down to the end of the lane , I 'll pick you up there . I think I can get the car through the others now that people have begun to go . "  |p108The  warmthand fragrance of the night was close on either side in the narrow lane as they drove , and honeysuckle vines brushed soft as water against the side of the car . Catherine Roberts had perhaps waited a long time to speak of this , and now her voice touched Jaeger in every nerve , its tenderness breakingat times as if wounded past all healing , and then recoveringits passionate urgency . How will you recognize her if you come across her tonight unless I give you the dimensionsof her terror or the sound of her wild , panting breath ? For you and I are the posse , the bloodhounds setting out on her trail , she might have been saying to him . You 've read in the papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or who was last seen wandering by the sea , and the night comes down , and still no trace , no footsteps at the edge of the canyon or the water , still no answering cry . And , God , what do you do then , which way do you turn , how do you keep your reason from reeling in your head ? And yet it may have been that she did not say these words , or even speak of the loss of a child , but of losing a possession like identity that can escape through your fingers if you are not able to give it a name . When children wander off in the dark alone , it is n't after flower , or bird , or firefly , or anything the eye can see or the hand can touch , she might have been saying , but Jaeger was not certain that these were the words she used . " I saw fireflies for the first time in America , " he said when her voice ceased for a moment . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I was n't speaking of fireflies , " Catherine Roberts said in soft impatience with him . " Still , I was thinking of them . I do n't know why they came to my mind . Perhaps because of the dark and the smell of honeysuckle , " Jaeger said . " But maybe I was thinking of them too ! Maybe that explains it , " Catherine Roberts said . " I truly do n't know what I 'm thinking . Perhaps of will-o ' - the- wisps . I 've drunk too much white wine , and that is why the heart speaks clearly , but not the mind , and I am so pleased by the taste of cold white German wine , dry like tonight , so touched , Herr Jaeger , so terribly moved by the doors of the heart , the ducts of pity , that it opens . But I should have the courage to pour every long-necked bottle down the hillside , and let it drench the stones of the lane and the roots of cabbage . I should do anything at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she lifts a glass , I should strike it from her hand . And I  --  I should not drink when Milly is near . " The air that had been warm on their faces changed suddenly , and they seemed for a moment to be passing through the moist rock of a tunnel , but it was the bridge over the quiet , unhastening river that they crossed . And then they moved through the tepid night again as the car mounted the hill . " You may think this has happened so many times before that I know exactly what to do , but I do n't know anything at all , Herr Jaeger , " Catherine Roberts was saying , her voice low . " When children wander off in the dark alone , it 's because the question is hammering louder and louder in their blood , and they ca n't bear it any longer . They gallop in fright like colts , the way Milly has gone , direction or distance meaning nothing , and if they do n't find the answer as they run , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the underbrush andp110they eat its petals and heart , or they plunge under the surface of the water , with the songs of the wild birds that have lured them roaring in their ears as they go down . I 've had too much wine , " she whispered . " Does it seem to you sometimesthat all of us in Germany are living in limbo ? Nothinghas been decided about any of us yet , not even the durationof our sojourn , so perhaps it is more like purgatory . But Milly has never gone off like this before . She has never fled from us . She has borne us in uncomplaining docility . Ah , but I can understand her running out of the mausoleum of that house where you saw the heart of a man cut out of his breast while he still lived  --  or lived in limbo , anyway  --  and offered to the guests with the plates of hot Wurst and the beer . I should make a sea of all the beer in Hesse and drown the brewer who haunts that house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'll stop dreaming and dreaming of the sons who are prisoners of war in Russia still ! Two of them , or three , or four , perhaps a whole regimentof them , who cares ? I should send her body floating , bloated and horrible , as a warning to other mothers down the mainstream of German identity . It is they , that man and woman , who have driven Milly out ! Oh , stop me , Herr Jaeger ! Stop me from saying all these things I do not want to say ! What has happened to us here in this country ? I crying out things to you so mad that they should go down in silence to the grave with me , and you , a young man , with life quite simple , quite attainable , before you , having nothingbetter to do with your nights and days than throw them away like this ! " Jaeger trembled with pain and love for her as he rode beside her on the cushioned seat of this car that had borne him , and the Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had rocked so ponderously out over the corduroy road . Now it soared lightly toward the Schlossp111that brooded in darkness above them , and he asked the other , rushing dark at the windows how she had borne the years of marriage with the red-jowled , arrogant man in uniform , how she had slept in his bed at night and yet carriedthis illumination ( purity ? passion ? ) undimmed in her flesh . Lovers ? he thought , and it was not the first time he had reflected on it . All right , then , lovers , he thought , stabbing his own heart with the word . He wondered how she had managed it , with Colonel Roberts scenting the wind . Out of his anguish , he said : " But I have no simple , attainable life before me . I am like a refugee in this country . I belong to nothing . Only you can tell me where to begin . " " Ah , do n't say that ! " Catherine Roberts cried out . The car was taking the curves too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me tonight instead of you , a stranger , then say it ! It 's wrong of you to speak so softly , always under your breath ! You should speak louder than the others , louder than any of the others , louder than the Herr Direktor and the Herr Oberburgermeister , and louder than the brewer , because what you are saying is strangely important , like a telegram the young are sending to the old , and the sense of it must get through  --  " " But I have never said anything . I have scarcely spoken , " Jaeger said . " You spoke of a nightingale giving its blood to the white rosebush . I remember that , " said Catherine Roberts . " You spoke of genders , and verbs , and words that have no syntacticalrelation to anything in life , and the past subjunc-tive . " " No , " said Jaeger , and he laughed out loud . " Once you said There 's absolutely nothing wrong with me . I 've simply lost my horse . ' Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white wine speaking from the dark ,  |p112dark  green of the long-necked bottle ! " she said . " This is the wine speaking like an eloquent sister moving in my blood . It makes it possible  --  no , necessary , for me to say to you that when I find Milly and put my arms around her to take her home , it will only be her flesh that I touch , and what she is will still be running away from me in silence through the trees . " " Why are you going to the Schloss ? " said Jaeger . " How do you know where she will be ? " " Because I saw her as the speeches began , looking sidewaysfor help or exit , " she said . " And she could n't find either , and so she went with her head lowered , to the back row with Stephany . Oh , Herr Jaeger , be Milly for an instant ! I 'm so afraid of that lowered head , that terrible docility ! Be Milly seeking for pride  --  yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but pride entirely stripped of medals and rank  --  would n't she run blindly to the proudest child she knew , and the proudest beasts , so where else would shego ? " " Yes , " Jaeger said , slowly , pausing between each word . " Yes . Yes . " " My husband calls him a groom , a stable groom , " said Catherine Roberts , and the car climbed fast . They were nearly at the archway now . " I call him the grieving prince , " said Jaeger . " He has rubbed shoulders with the elite since childhood , but what he is by this time , I do n't know . " " He 's still a child , " Catherine Roberts said in defense of him as they drove into the courtyard . Beyond the radius of the car 's lights , the stone water-basin and the cobbles could be only dimly seen , but , closer , the brocade of moss , the short fresh blades of grass , the star-like flower heads , were as bright , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Perhaps you could call his name out under the windowp113of his room , wherever the window would be , " she said , and she lowered the headlights , and stopped the motor of the car . Jaeger got out , and quietly closed the door , and as he crossed toward the stables , he was filled with a pleasurable , quiet sense of his own power . It was as if , without warning , their roles had been transposed , and now he was the figure of action and responsibility , and she must sit passive , in abeyance , until his decision was made . He did not know where Horn 's room would be , but , wherever he found him , the language that he and Horn would speak would be their own male tongue , while the mother and daughter would wait , suspended in silence , until summoned from the shadowsby the vigor of man 's disposal of this moment in their lives . He walked across the cobbles toward the Lipizzaners ' quarters , moving toward the white horses of inestimable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a mansardroom above their stalls . He found the heavy door in the darkness , and pulled it back , and he stood for a momentbreathing the fragrance of the stables , harking to the scarcely audible sounds that bespoke the presence of the horses , the breath in the velvet nostril , the faintest of movementsin the straw . Then he called out : " Hello , Christoph Horn ! Hall-oo , Horn ! " A horse got to its feet without panic in the dark , and shook its head , and he heard the whir of its sneezing , but no answer came from the rafters . " Christoph Horn , are you asleep ? " Jaeger called . The elation still possessed him , for this was his situation as perhaps none had ever been so completely his before . There were no orders to wait for , none except those his own heart and will would give him , no voice out of any inheritedpast to tell him this or that was the thing he now must do . He was not Wehrmacht soldier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would run this story of un/equivocal decision for other men to read . In the car halted in the medieval courtyard , a beautiful , submissive woman waited , and what he did now meant either redemption or finality . However gently she might explain it afterward , he could not risk falling from a horse again . He must state in every act now a meaning so simple , so lucid , that two interpretations could not be given it . To find Christoph Horn and Millicent was not enough ; he must transmute their sleeping or their waking into innocent and honorable terms . He must speak to them as if to figures in a parable of tender love , as Catherine Roberts would seek to do . Out of their fear crouching in the darkness above his head , he would make a loud , clear music that would shake the rafters with its power ; out of their silence , a duet of Tristan and Isolde that would strike the trembling stars . It was certainly not the first time that lovers had lain in each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intruder shouted from below . " Hall-oo , Horn ! " he called out , and now someone moved in the room above the stalls . Jaeger heard the footsteps crossing the boards , heavy , guiltless steps , and when the voice came in answer , it was not Christoph Horn 's , but a voice with a broad , country accent answering through a dormer window that had opened on the court . " Horn , he took Sigmar and Neapoli out , " the voice called down , the names of the horses clanging like metal on the courtyard stones . " Took them out ? Does Horn go riding at night ? " Jaeger asked , and he laughed . He drew the stable door closed again , and stepped out of the odor of clean straw and horse into the sweet-scented night . In the shingled roof of the mews , no dormer was lit , and the sloping wing of the roof wasp115opaque shadow against the lesser darkness of the sky . " When did Horn go out ? " he called . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable boy 's voice , the pace of the words , like the movement of the thoughts in his head , labored and slow . " I 'm new here , " he said . " I do n't know the time . " There was the sound of the window closing against the warmth of June , and Jaeger walked to the car , and leaned on the open window and , in the dimness that washed back from the parking-lights , he could see the pale , sad beauty of her face . " Come , " he said gently . " Put the lights out . Perhaps he 's down at the riding-rink . We 'll leave the car here . " The rink had been built at the entrance to the thickly meshed forest floor , with only a bridle path leading to it , and a bridle path leading away . He had seen it when he walked up from town to get the story on the horse show , a circular barracks whose stained wood was tangled and lost , like the wood of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The roof of it was wheel-shaped , with the rafters the spokes of it , radiating from the hub , and a door as wide as a carriage entrance opening onto the hoof-marked path . As they walked , Catherine Roberts and Jaeger did not speak , and although only the starlight high above the path showed them the way , he did not take her hand . It seemed to him they were less alone than when they rode together in the car , and the strangeness of Catherine Roberts , or any American , walking , possessed him now as it had on the day that Snafu tossed him to the ground . Refugees , expellees , outcasts , walked ; they wandered the length of the Autobahn , carrying all that was left to them on their backs , in search of work , or in search of families they had once known , or of wives and husbands and children that had once beenp116theirs , or in search of the walls of houses that they must know were no longer standing anywhere . And Germans walked ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West , the old , the young , the crippled , the hale , some on crutches , some with arms severed at the shoulder , the elbow , or ending at the wrist , like Napoleon 's or Hitler 's armies straggling back out of the Russian snows . Or Germanscame limping back from France with the international letters stamped on their worn , grey coveralls , prisoners returningin search of what the white wine in Catherine Roberts ' veins had called the mainstream of national identity . But Americans never put foot to this foreign soil , perhaps uneasy about the imprint that the Occupier must , of necessity , always leave , thought Jaeger ; and now that CatherineRoberts walked through the darkness with him like the dispossessed , these others seemed to walk with them , stumbling , or limping , or swinging their torsos on their crutches , as they came . " When you walk through the woods , do you feel your ancestorsfollowing ? " Catherine Roberts said , and for a startled moment , Jaeger thought he had spoken aloud of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods at home , it was always the Indians following me , night and day , and just as frightening , somehow , by day , hearing them following on narrow brown feet , you know . " The white wine gave it the quality of a dream rather than truth or history . " My father was an army doctor , gentle , bewildered , and I was born on an army post ! I still do n't believe it . My mother was French . I do n't know what they were doing in the army , either of them . It did n't make any sense whatsoever . She knew a great many things , even that it did n't make any sense , so she became an invalid , planning it veryp117carefully . But I did n't know this as a child , and my heart was racked , oh , racked and torn ! You know , it is only motherswho matter , " she whispered so that none of the others following should hear . " They can give everything , or they can take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knowing that . Knowing , I mean , that fathers do n't matter , and simplyca n't matter . It 's only the desperate , desperate mothers , piecing their children together out of their own hopes and fears . My mother experienced it all in books , every instant of life . Think of sleeping with Flaubert , poor , shy Flaubert , and Romain Rolland , and even delighting Proust in bed ! Imagine the faces of the other army wives when she brought Above the Battle or Jean-Christophe 's insatiable passion instead of her knitting to the tea table ! If they were stationedin Texas , or Fort Lauderdale , or Chillicothe , whereverit was , she always escaped . Those cream-colored , blackand-redtitled , paper-back books from France were everywhere . And how could my father , so gentle , so forbearing , compete with their virility , even with Indian blood in his family history ? Gently , gently , Herr Jaeger , he drank himselffirst to sleep , and then to death , without any fanfare at all . And you ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was your father like ? " Jaeger said that in peacetime der Alte had served as a petty official in the city government of Niederstadt , sixty miles down the Autobahn , which the Americans knew only as a center of blasted factories and gutted mansions and bomb-excavated public parks . But he had grown up there and , as a boy , known it in every season and in other ways . " When I was quite young , my father became a violent Ludendorffer , anti-Semitic , anti-Christian even , " said Jaeger . " After the first war , he could no longer accept the contemporaryworld because it meant accepting the defeat of Germany , and that he could not take . He returned top118Wotan and Thor , to a sort of neo-heathenism , and he was always for the expulsion of the Jews , but peacefully , withoutmurder , or arson , or argument . " His father had never completed his education , and had been no more than an O fiziersstellvertreter in the First World War , he said . " You hear a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Catherine Roberts , but he knew it was never a dead man or a liquidated army she was thinking of . And then the high , oblong links of light appeared , shiningthrough the leaves , and the muted pounding of horses ' hoofs shook deeply in the earth . Catherine Roberts stopped . " What am I going to do ? " she whispered . " Oh , God , Jaeger , what am I going to do if Milly is n't there ? " Jaeger lifted the bolt , and the door swung wide , and a panel of light fell across the hoof-scuffed beam that served as step , and out onto the packed loam of the path . Inside , the place was lit as if for a ball , and they stepped in over the beam , and paused , bedazzled by light , on the sawdust of the entranceway . A wooden barrier stood shoulderhighbetween them and the oval ring , and within the enclosure of the ring , two pure white horses with silken tails passed in the disciplined gallop of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under their hoofs like spray . Their necks arched , their heads held faultlessly , they moved lightly , steadily , through a silence like that intervalin suspended sound when a merry-go-round revolves still , and the wooden horses rise and fall , although the calliopehas ceased to play . But now another music blared out in celebration , and Catherine Roberts put her hand quickly on Jaeger 's arm , for it was Milly who rode . She wore the gossamer evening-dress still , the skirt of it thrust insidea pair of breeches that hung too long over her bare feet , and her face was marvelously bewitched . Beside her rode Christoph Horn , his cheeks a little wan and hollow , hisp119hair , under the grey Wehrmacht cap , pushed behind his ears like a poet 's , a musician 's , hair . In his sad , drab clothes and his cracked military boots , he rode without stirrups , and the fish-eyed horse , called Sigmar for short , flowed strong and pure between his thighs . But it was not the ease of their riding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uproarof all that was understood between them , the curve of body , the slender , gripping legs , the hot vulnerability of wrist and breast and throat and lip , the lifting of hair from temple and brow , akin to the lifting of the horses ' unsullied manes . And now the Lipizzaners as well heard the music that trumpeted in the blood , and they no longer moved in their gallopade , but floated , with forelegs miraculously poised , in unison to the measures of the air . Catherine Roberts and Jaeger watched across the wooden barrier . As if they were spectators in a paddock , they watched Christoph Horn lead into the center of the ring , and Milly follow , and the Lipizzan horses appeared to pause there for an instant , but they did not pause , but moved into another fluid figure of the dance . " The Pirouette ' ! " Christoph called out , his voice vibratingthrough the rink as if he called across water to a high , far shore . And the Lipizzaners cantered lightly again , executingthe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lashed eyes on the spectators at the barrier , their bits ringing softly in their mouths . Just above the stained wainscoting of the hall , framed reproductions ran from pillarto post , showing the short-nosed stallions of the Spanish court performing their leaps , their ballotades , their caprioles , in the Vienna Riding Hall . In these antique copper-plates , ladies in grand decollete looked down from the boxes on the horses paired below , and gentlemen of the court , with swords at their belts and fringed epaulettes , watched through opera glasses as the Quadrille passed . In the platep120hanging close to the outer door , the loge of Austrian royalty was shown , with the coat-of-arms of the monarchy over the cornice , and two long-limbed warriors seated above the portraitin oils of the Emperor . But only the horses the longdeadlooked down on seemed to breathe with an enduring power . Their hindquarters were etched as strong and white as life , and their necks were packed with flesh like a mackerel'sside . Their shoulders were woven with muscle , and because of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made for horses far frailer than those that were pictured , or those  --  their descendants  --  who now moved in the ring . " The Redoppe ' ! " Christoph called out , and the horses leaped with the static grace of statues flying . Over and over they made their effortless , winged leaps , with such a strange , weightless power in their limbs that it seemed as if sawdust and sand had been pulled from under them , thus giving them the appearance of soaring in the air . " The Terre a Terre ' ! " Christoph called , and no switch flicked at shoulder or croup , and no rein seemed to tighten , but once more the horses flowed into their gallopade , and at the curve fell back upon their haunches , and rose , and leaped , and then continued the parabola of their flight , and rose and leaped again . " Jaeger , Herr Jaeger , " the mother whispered . " I 've never seen her belong to anything before . " " But you must have brought her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he watched the girl in envy and chagrin , thinking of the horse he had once ridden called Snafu . " But it is n't just that , " Catherine Roberts said quickly , and now her hand moved from Jaeger 's arm , and the clenched fingers of it beat softly on the barrier 's wood . " It 's more than just riding a horse . It 's something no one should witness , no one at all . We should n't be standing here . " Jaeger could see the hollow beneath her cheekbone , andp121the vein in her temple , and the tendrils of hair , dark copper , by her ear . Standing so , he could see the small face of the watch on her wrist , the hands of it marking twenty minutespast midnight , and breathe the subtle odors of her hair , her flesh . For the first time now , with a shock to his heart that was like a physical blow , he thought of her becominghis mistress , his own love , and he trembled . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sagging stairs , and he could even see how the dust would lie on the treads as they mounted together , and see his own hand , shaking with haste as it turned the knob of the door . They would sit on the edge of the white iron bed , and he would look at her face , knowing that it would be fixed in his sight until the last moment of his life , that he would take it down into the grave with him , fighting even in death to keep it clear of the rain , and rot , and defacement , and decay . He would be beyond speech , beyond apology for the worn places in the carpet , and for the mirror with the quicksilver flecking from it so that only garbled reflections of what they were would be with them there in the silent room . ( Even the landlady 's presence in the house would be obliterated by the torrent of this that poured through their veins , drown : ing out the whine of the voice saying that there were five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every man in England , asking what had he found the ratio in America to be ? " Only single men are entitled to rooms to themselves , " she had said , " because men have needs that women do n't have , or else do n't talk about . " The room would be wiped clean of her cautions concerning hygiene and decency . ) His hand would touch his love 's bare throat , his fingers open her blouse , his mouth close on her mouth . And then hands that were no longer his would draw the silk of her garments aside , gently at first , and then tearing them , and neither caring , neither knowing if it was midnightp122or dawn , or what was the season , for they would lie together on the roughness of the khaki blanket , she supple and yieldingon the broken springs , he burning , mindless , naked as he had never been before in the fury of this love . Here was her cheek , her throat , within reach of his hand , but if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no meaning for her , for it was as if the girl rode between them , rode back and forth on the white stallion , shouldering them apart . He had not been told the entire story , and yet it seemed to him that he knew the sequence of it . It would not be just this one isolated June night , but all the nights of youth that had followed upon the hopeless , inarticulate days of youth , that the girl had gone runningthrough labyrinths of fear . Who am I ? Who am I ? Which way must I go ? had perhaps been screamed out in the German darkness as she carne panting up the hill with the stuff of her evening-dress catching on bush and hedge and honeysuckle vine . Who am I ? What am I doing here ? she may have cried out to the absolute silence of this countryas to the silence of the others . Give me a drink now , God damn it , so that I need n't know ! Give me a drink ! shemay have shouted , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had ever been offered in the tumult and uncertainty . But now she had come to a clearing in the complex of the forest , a stillness that was not oblivion , and she sat the white horse erectly , riding as straight as Christophrode , her mermaid 's eyes holding fast to him . Whateversavage mazes lay ahead , it would be different , thought Jaeger , they would all be passable , because of a stable door that had opened , if only for a little while , on a sawdust ring marked by the iron of the Lipizzaners ' shoes . He remembered Borchert writing : " We are the generation withoutfarewell . We may live no farewell , we must not , for on the stray paths trodden by our feet our wandering heartsp123find endless farewells . " But in the end you will have to say it to Christoph , he thought , and then where will you go ? The two horses had halted side by side in the center of the ring , and now they lowered their heads and bent their knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed . But at once a clapping of hands broke out over Catherine Roberts ' and Jaeger 's heads , and they knew that there were others watching in the hall . The tempered applausewas like rain falling gently on the wheel-shaped roof , and Christoph advanced Sigmar a step or two , and looked up at the loge , and doffed his cap in deference . But who was seated there could not be seen from the entranceway , for the loge thrust like a balcony over the heads of any commoners who stood below . And now the horse that Milly rode danced forward , but the steps he executed were never the classical figures of the Spanish Riding School . The girl rode easily , lightly , without guile , as if there was no other meaning to it , while this horse of lineage laid aside his dignityand took a step to this side and two steps to the other , ready , it seemed , to cock one foot and lean against a lamp post if one came his way . " Neapoli 's a fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's voice said in German above their heads . The tone was querulous , the accent cultivated , the pitch that of an old man 's voice , a little high . But the horse danced on like an angel debased by mortal weakness , the celestial wings lowered in the dust , the grave , intelligent countenance transformed by comedy . In another moment , he might wink one eye . And this time he danced for the two standing by the barrier , for the others in the loge above had pushed their chairs back , and their steps sounded on the wooden stairs . " Oh , Milly , Milly , " Catherine Roberts whispered , watch . ing the girl 's confession danced in shy , sly parody of thep124thing she had never spoken of , and could not speak of now . For she was making a clear enough statement , hamming it , playing it as burlesque , but , however she did it , still it was this that the mother had waited a long time to hear . The foolish , unbalanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feigning hoofs , the clowning , were the stumbling , cockeyedpassages of her admission of her curse and bane . " Does she want me to say that I understand ? Does she want me to say it ? " the mother whispered , and there was hope in her voice , as if she believed in this instant that once the avowal was stated , then the various contrivances of redemption could be found . Christoph turned Sigmar on his haunches , and swung him close to Neapoli , to the great , foolish , reeling stallion who had learned obedience so well that he did not question the tricks it played him now . " Miss Roberts , be a good girl , " Christoph said in his oddly perfect English . His voice and his horse were quiet as he put his hand over her hand on the reins . " Be sensible . Remember the first rule : only movements that are natural to the horse as he runs , or fights , or plays . " The mask of his face was sharp and worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruse in city streets , thought Jaeger , and has eaten whatevercould be filched from the refuse of the incurably rich , and , year after year , lain down to sleep on stone . " Rememberthere is an audience , " he said hardly aloud , as the child might have said from the corner of his . mouth : " Watch your step . There 're cops around every corner , there 're plainclothesguys in the shadow of every door . " Their horses waited side by side , motionless , and the two riders looked into each other 's faces , their eyes and mouths sad and young and more alike than other people 's , but flickeringnow with gentle mutabilities . Christoph 's hand still covered hers , and they sat as if waiting for some authorityp125to sanction their tenderness , for Church or Law to approbatethe fragrance of orange blossoms , or the length of a white satin train , or waiting merely to be granted nights without farewell . But the authorities who now stepped into the picture were neither the Church nor Law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who emerged from the covered stairs . They were dressed for another occasion , having clearly been routed out of sleep to make their appearancehere . The lady 's elderly legs were visible to the calf , and bare , and there were plaid wool bedroom slippers on her long , narrow feet . She wore a black military cloak , perhaps acquired in Italy at a time when the Axis was still solvent , and her iron hair was wrenched back from temple and brow in a chignon that any washerwoman might have resorted to . But in testimony to her aristocratic blood , a ribbed white band of grosgrain bound fast the sagging musclesof her throat , and pinhead diamonds twinkled in her ears . Her face was equine , except for the abruptly short and pretty nose . This would be the Gra fin , Jaeger knew ; and her companion , in mustard-colored , black-velvet-collared and velvet-buttoned overcoat , would be the stiff-legged , stiffneckedGraf , shorn now of castle and estate , the lord in exile on his own domain , who lived on the rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those in the Occupation who sought to pass for gentlemen . ( For if the Schloss had been turned into an Officers ' Club , and no German guest was permitted to set foot beyond the ancestraldoors , Jaeger knew exactly how it would be : in the entrance hall , where generations of the nobly born had laid aside loden capes and silver-headed canes , had unbuckled scabbards and fur-lined boots , there would be an American news-stand displaying Time and Life and Look , and any number of colored comic books , and a glass case exhibiting variously packeted Chiclets and chewing-gums . ) The Grafp126appeared to have only a nightshirt under the shabby , threequarter-lengthcoat , and his polished , hairless shins were bare . But the neck , corrugated like a turkey 's , rising in pride from the velvet collar , and the monocle in the right eye , were dignity enough to take the look of dishabille away . They must have been roused from sleep some time before , perhaps by the blaze of lights in the riding-rink at that late hour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all should have been darkened and stilled by night . They must have been awakened in their beds in the gardener 's lodge , and stalked out past the strawberry beds and the greenhouses to see . " Good evening , " said the Graf , speaking a cool , disdainfulEnglish to these people he had no need or wish to know . He adjusted the glass in the socket of his eye , his ashen fingertips lingering on the black ribbon that hung from it , and Catherine Roberts and Jaeger repeated good-evening , but the Gra fin did not speak . And now Jaeger felt that the situation was slipping from his grasp , and he knew that if he did not speak , the roles he and Catherine Roberts played would be reversed again , and she would no longer be a woman waiting in submission while he pounded on stable doors , and shouted out names , and shifted the wings and scenery of their stage . If he ceased to act , be would again be the Julian Sorel of the Occupation , and he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veins . For what was he before these people but merely a German , a German withoutthe rights of lineage or culture entitling him to carry a brief-case in confirmation of his caste ? He was neither lackey who groomed and trained and rode their horses for them , nor a peer who could exchange with them the acrimoniousstories about the men and women who occupied their soil . He was merely a prisoner of war come home ,  |p127without  decorations , wearing an ersatz-wool suit , and shoes that were strangers to him still , and the knowledge of this tied him hand and foot before them , and gagged his mouth . " The horses , the Lipizzan horses , are beautiful , beautiful , " Catherine Roberts said , but no one seemed to hear her speak . And Jaeger stood with lowered eyes before the Gra fn and the Graf , and before the child called Christoph Horn , silent , because he who knew the poets of Germany , and the musicians , and the look of other countries , had failed to keep one room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As he stood there , the bloodless lips of the Graf seemed to shape words , as lips moved on the silent screen of a lifetimebefore , defining the story of what he and the others like him knew had taken place . One man , a foreigner , a housebreaker ( the pinched lips affirmed , having no need of the validity of sound ) , one single gangster who had alreadyserved a prison term , came tramping with soiled boots over the fair earth of the Fatherland , forcing his way into the dwelling-places of the humble and the gently bred , forcinghis way even into the churches , leaving a trail of filth on the sacred carpets and the hallowed graves . One man had stamped through the stately chambers of this manlionthat had been Germany , through the naves of her cathedrals , screaming imprecations , execrating all that had spiritual value and cultural meaning , all that was of fine workmanship , all that he could not assess the inestimable value of , all that was beyond his experience , all that was ivory , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across a mountainousfrontier , nurtured on envy , reared in poverty ( the Graf 's lips drew thin as a wire to say ) , had torn the portraitsof ancestors from the walls in frenzy , for no reason that could be named except he had none to hang there in their place . He had dragged the holy images from thep128temples of worship , besmirching , befouling all that he touched , until , instead of the ancient Germanic forbearance and tolerance , instead of the old goodness and devotion that had , since time immemorial , lit candles at Christmastide , sent little German children singing through the streets , and brought lilies to their flowering at Easter , instead , hatred , falsehoods , and , finally , murder , became the ritual of the feast days and holidays . This murderer , this madman with a gift for oratory , had turned the ancestral halls and the churches into shrines for the anti-Christ , whose name he coupled with his own . Yes , he murdered . He was a murderer , said Jaeger , standingsilent there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all this was alien to German history . This must be considered as one chapter of the new revolution that is moving across Europe , the revolt of the ignorant and unlettered against the cultivatedand wise , the revolt of the slave against the master , the assault of the homeless tramp , the vagabond , on the gentle householder as he sits at peace with his family by his hearth . It was the illiterate intruder , and those he had mesmerizedinto following him , who had brought war upon the country , and it was the literate , the informed men of rank , who had sought to curb him , and who went to their deaths without the medals of valor they had earned through their long service in the defense of Germany . It was the German generals , men of breeding and unflinching loyalty , whom the upstart had first blackened with his lies , and then ordered murdered in their beds , or hung on the gallows , without honor , in the name of the new doctrine of demoniacal revolt . These martyrs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their deaths with heads held high , stripped of their decorations , their executioners holding be/fore their dying eyes the four-pronged symbol of hatred that was hooked even into the hearts of those who had seized power in Germany . And what of the Jews ? asked Jaeger in silence , his eyes still lowered . What of the Jews while all this was taking place ? There were no Jews ( the Graf 's lips flickered on the silent screen ) . The Jews had been resettled . They had moved away . And now we who are left must bear ourselves as did those others who were stripped of all honor before they died . We must walk with quiet step , looking neither to right nor left , as the generals walked , not indifferent , but outwardly blind to the presence of those who , within the space of twenty-odd years , have won a second military victoryover us . Is all this country 's beauty , its high traditions , its carefully nurtured power , to be squandered by the money-makers on one portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Graf 's eye closed for a moment like a fowl 's blue-lidded eye , and the old lips shaped the final questions : Is this our doom ? Is this how we shall end ? " Make it clear to the Americans that it is late for visitors , " the Grd fin said in German , and she looked up with coldly armored eyes at Christoph sitting on fish-eyed Sigmar . " The Gra fin says it is late for visitors , " Christoph translatedwith gentleness to the girl . And , at once , the riding-rink with its brilliantly lit chandeliers , its enduring copper-plates of royalty , its impermanentdeposits of steaming , gold manure , was hushed for the girl to speak . And Jaeger , too , waited , having heard her voice not more than half a dozen times before . " Yes , it is very late , " she said , her tilted eyes heavy . For a moment , she stared blindly down at the Grd fen and thep130Graf , the sight of them perhaps blurred by sleep , or drink , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she said . And then came the whine of the police siren outside in the dark . Closer and closer it came , tentative , questioning , without haste , accompanied by the brittle uproar of snapped and broken brush as the car ( a jeep , it could only have been ) battered its way down the narrow bridle path . When the knocking sounded on the door , the horses remainedmotionless . When the American voices , young and male , rang out , the horses ' ears flicked , but still they did not move . It was only when the three Military Policemen stumbledinto the light that Neapoli swerved in panic , and the girl turned in the saddle and cried Christoph 's name . He swung Sigmar on his haunches , and rode swiftly , casually , but with the steel of anger in his wrists and knees , across the ring , and caught Neapoli 's head , and spoke to the girl and the horse in soft-tongued authority . " We 're looking for Mrs. Roberts , the Colonel 's wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink and smooth , his eyes stark blue , and clipped yellow bristles showed under his stiff-beaked cap . He looked like a boy dressed up for this part in a school play , not at ease with the white stick they had given him to carry , not knowing whether or not to draw the revolver from the holster on his hip . " Anybody speak English here ? " he said . " We all speak English , " said Catherine Roberts . " Why are you looking for me ? " " Well , orders , " said the young policeman , so like a child uneasily outfitted in khaki , with a white band fixed to his sleeve , and a white stick in his raw , blond hand . " You  --  if you 're Mrs. Roberts  --  and she  --  her , " he said , the words stuttering in his mouth . " You and your daughter  --  if that 's your daughter  --  we 've been looking better than an hour for131you . We got our orders to pick you up and escort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roberts said , and her lips were white . She stood there under the eyes of the Graf and the Gra fin , under the brilliant , formal lights , her color ebbingaway . " The Colonel 's orders , ma'am , " he said.  |p132It  wasthe week the currency reform took place , and , from one day to the next , the shops that had been empty as last year 's birds ' nests since the surrender were overflowing with goods that had been hoarded in attic and cellar and warehouse for this moment in history . At once , peasants jolted in from the countryside around in pre-war motor cars , the women and girls in Hessian Sunday dress , with neat white coifs and silky aprons , and the men , the old men and the young , with their sons exact miniatures of themselves , came dressed in black stern enough and enduring enough to outlast endless ceremonies of death , marriage , baptism , and countless wars . They came on bicycle and on foot , Omas and Opas , some hale and hearty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as autumn leaves . Plowhands , shoemakers , butchers , and dairymen , they were , still too cautious to buy , but coming to ogle the windows of the Fahrbach stores , seeing again the old wealth of Hohner harmonicas ; gilt-stenciled accordionswith ivory keys ; new shoes , new handbags , long fiber stockings , rubber boots , frying-pans . They paused , stricken dumb , but a gleam of calculation covert in their eyes , before umbrellas with tassels of purple silk fraying on their handles , before notebooks , both plain and ruled , and pencils , paperclips , thumbtacks , needles and thread that the women 's hearts had broken in half for in the long dark of the years . They stopped dead in their heavy boots , both women and men , on the strips of paving-stone above the cobbled gutters , held by the sight of candles and cakes of laundry soap . No one had seen the like of it in more than a decade . It was like a holiday time , a time of resurrection . Jaeger'sp133salary went up overnight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well ; he wanted to take things lightly , with a wry , quick twisting of philosophy to transform the facts to his own ends , the way a Frenchman would . A new suit , another pair of shoes , might now be possible by autumn , by winter , at least by the following spring . It was as if water had been turned to wine , silver to gold , and early one morning , in the midst of this season of festivity , he took the train for Niederstadt , his heart as light as the : June air . The train was one which only a defeated country would have any use for , made up of cars that had survived ' bombings and strafings and twenty-odd years of deterioration , coupled behind an engine that steamed at every pore . But , for him , it might have been a holiday train he was taking to glacier country ; it might have been moving over mountain passes , up slopes of gentian and edelweiss , . toward the world 's last edge of everlasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Military Government court to cover a story was merely reality ; the part of it that made him sing aloud was that he was on an excursion out of the flat country of what he had been , away from the weeping willows of his hopeless love . He walked down the corridor of the train , seeing the blur of the country through the unwashed panes , singing under his breath about " Lindy Lou , " with honeysuckle yellow at her breast . He wanted a seat alone , if he could find it , and he wanted her , darkskinnedand happy , laughing hard , waiting for him , in the Niederstadt station 's rubble , with rhinestones glittering in her heels , and in the velvet of her ears , the Lindy Lou that Robeson 's voice offered like honey to the tongue . In one compartment he passed , there was a single traveler , and Jaeger turned back , and slid the unsteady door aside . By the long-befouled window sat a young man with black , puzzled eyebrows splashed across his brow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the cane between the young man 's legs , and the yellow brassard , marked with a triangle of three black dots , upon his sleeve . The train had begun to move again , and Jaeger considered with some emotion that he could not name ( bitterness , irritation , it may have been ) that an entire division of men must have been blinded at the Russian front . God must have leaned down that winter and laid his finger on one after the other of them as they passed into the snows , saying : " This one , and this one , and this one , must give up his eyes " ; not even taking the trouble to add : " That a shame for you that you 've had only nineteen or twenty years to look at the mountains and fields and rivers and valleys , and so forth , not to mention the breasts of women and the faces of whateveroffspring you may produce . But take comfort in the biological fact , my children , that your other senses will increasein sensitivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every streetcar , in every train , in every university hall . They tapped their way to the America House of Fahrbachto listen to music , or listen to lectures , their ears sharp as traps for the sound of voices which had once read aloud to them , and might read aloud to them again . They tapped upstairs and down and along the hallways , tapping even into the projection room , for God knows what reason , where slides were being shown that they could never hope to see . Even had they not carried canes and worn the yellowarmbands , and even before the scarlet , empty buttonholesof their eyesockets could be perceived , they were marked by their excessive cleanliness , their well-brushed clothing , their well-shined shoes , the hair so neatly trimmed and combed . It was as if women , all women , cherished these blind young men in the name of the children who had grown away from them , or whom they had never borne , or for the sake of the sons wiped out by war , caring for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need , the absence of vision making them forever children for women to dress , and comb , and feed , and bathe in the warm fluid of their love . Jaeger had eased himself into the nearest corner , scarcely breathing , for this had been designated as a holiday time , and the blind got in the way . But , however surreptitiouslyhe had moved , still above the grating of the wheels , and the creaking of the exhausted wood , the young man in a black jacket gone too short in the sleeves , too tight in the armpits , must have heard the far sound of his beating heart , for he began to speak . " Are you on your way to Niederstadt or getting off before ? " he asked . " Are you traveling on business ? " Jaeger knew the sequence of question and alerted silence , questionand again alerted silence , like a wireless code tapped out to the sighted from the mine pit in which the blind were sealed . He was thirsting for talk , for sight , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Like the others , he would never be slaked , this young blind man , so immaculatelyshaved , so neatly dressed , sitting alert there in the misted sunlight , looking straight ahead . Are you going to cast me the lifeline of your voice so that for two minutes and a half I may come within reach of the shore ? he might have been asking . Are you young or old , man or woman , Social-Democrat , Communist , member of the Deutsche Partei ? " I 'm working for the Fahrbach Presse , " Jaeger said , and now there was no help for it , and he slid down the varnished boards of the bench until he was opposite the blind man . " I 'm on my way to Niederstadt to cover a story there . " " A story on the monetary reform ? " the other man asked , his speech careful , precise . Whatever else his eyes had re/linquished , they had kept their beauty , and they had refused to close , but stared indecently at nothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velvet , depthless , pupilless , fixed absolutely still . " Are you going to do a story about politics , or about religion ? I 'm interested in all these things . I 'd like to know . " Under the heavy , inky brows , even the eyes seemed to wait for the answer , for the weaving and knotting of the rope of words that would draw him and bind him , in the instant that he listened , closer to the world of seeing men . " It might turn out to be political . I 'm not sure about that , " said Jaeger . In his hand he had the pack of American cigarettes , given him by Honerkamp two weeks before . " Would you like a Camel ? " he said . " I 'm not accustomed to smoking American cigarettes , " said the blind man , and Jaeger put one between his cleannailedfingers , and waited while he lifted it to his broad , red , thirsting mouth . Then he held the flame of the match in his curved hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . " Do you know any Americans ? " it went on at once . " I 've never had a conversation with an American . I 'm a philosophy student . I 'm twenty-six . My name is HeinrichWagner . Have you ever discussed philosophy with the Americans ? " Then the questions ceased , and he waited , his eyes quite still , fixed on some point of hearing straight ahead . " I know one or two Americans , " Jaeger began , but the young man wanted to speak of the money reform , and he ran his tongue along his lip . Since the Wahrungsref arm , he said , he was in a nearly desperate situation , for it had affectedhis life in more than a monetary way . " It is essential that I complete my studies , " he said , smokingthe Camel parsimoniously . " In a sense , you are an intellectual , too , so you will understand this . Perhaps journal/ism and philosophy are not first cousins , but at least they are both labor of the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no members of my familyleft to care for me . You probably have some members of your family left ? " he said , making a question of it . Jaegershook a cigarette out of the pack . " No , none , " he said . " Good , " said the blind man . He lifted the palm of his right hand that was broadened from years of closing on the cane , and the lines in it nearly effaced , and he dropped the ashes from the Camel into the cup it made . " But you still have many advantages over me . You can see to shave , and to cook your breakfast in the morning , and to clean your shoes . But me , I have no choice now but to change my way of living . I 've been making my home with an old woman who prepared my meals , and took care of my clothes , and shaved me , even , and I paid her what I could . This week , the very week of the Wahrungsre f @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad luck for you , " Jaeger said ; and because of the sound of reproach in the young man 's voice he added : " And for her as well . " " It was the Wahrungsreform that did it , the one D-Mark for ten Reichsmarks , " the blind man said . He smoked carefully , as if to make the Camel burn until the end of time . " She could n't have managed on the money she had saved . It would n't have lasted her a month . So she gave up . It was a form of suicide , " he said , impatient with this thing she had done so willfully , with aged , trembling intent . " She always said once the Wahrungsre f orm went through , old peoplewould n't be able to heat their rooms , or eat more than one meal a day , so the whole generation of them would have to stay in bed . She was forever complaining about that , sayingshe would n't be serving any purpose that way . Shep138would n't have been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or anything , just lying there , saving her strength . Well , that 's all very well for the old , I told her , but what about the young ? We ca n't go to bed to keep warm ! We ca n't afford to miss our classes ! The university is n't going to send its professors into our bedrooms to instruct us there ! " His tongue ran nervously along his lower lip that was red as the lining of an opera-glasses case , and his jaws were pocked with the eczema of these uncertainties . " And the country swarming with expellees , and East Zone refugees , eating our food , taking our rooms , taking jobs away from the kind of Germans who have first right to them ! How will it end ? " he cried out from the dark pit in which he lived . And then he asked the question which had perhaps been groping through his mind ever since Jaeger had come in . " What do you think of the advantages of marriage ? Are you married yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , but he did not wait now for the answers to come . " In my present situation , I have no choice . A married man is given better living-quarters . That 's obvious , of course . And then he has someone to cook for him , and if he picks out a wife of some intelligence , then she can be of use to him in his work , lookingup references in my case , and keeping my papers filed . I think I will save the last half of this cigarette , " he interruptedhimself . He held it between his fingers carefully . " If you could tell me where to snuff it out , I have an envelope here I could keep it in . " " No , finish it , finish it , " said Jaeger . " I 'll give you more . " I 'm going to Niederstadt for the purpose of getting married , " the blind man said with a sigh , and he put the cigarettebetween his lips again . " Otherwise , I would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking three days off , but I 'm counting on making up the lost time doing extrap140papers over the weekend . " He said he had every hope of his fiancee turning out satisfactorily . She was twenty-two , and had been brought up under hard conditions , in wartime , which was the best kind of training a woman could have .. She could not cook or sew as well as an older woman , he said , but her mother was doing her best to correct these deficiencies , and , in the past month , although a day for their marriage had not then been set , her father had insisted that she shave him every day . " He works in the post office , and he has to be at his window at seven thirty in the morning , " he said , " so in the past weeks he 's been getting up an hour earlier so that Ursula could practice on him ! It would n't matter too much if he went to work at the post office with a nick or two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my classes at the University with a massacred chin ! " He was almost ready to laugh out loud at the figure he would cut , but there were far graver things at stake , such as the relinquishing of his privacy . He held himself fixed and rigid on his seat , as if fearing that marriage would split him in two . His palm , with the cigarette ashes in the palm of it , was extended now , and he said : " Is there some way I could get rid of these ? I do n't want to drop them on the floor . " Jaeger guided his hand to the half-open window , and brushed the ashes off  --  as wan as dawn , they looked , the handful of them in the yellow flood of sun . " There 's not much left of your cigarette , " Jaeger said . " Oh , yes , there must be a draw or two ! I felt no indication of heat on my lips . " And now the blind young man brought out a worn brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid in it , and he found what he sought , and drew a photograph out . " This is the girl I am going to marry , " he said . Jaeger took the photograph from his hand , seeing that even in this cheapest , most ephemeral , of likenesses , the kind that in America emergesp140from a slot machine in a curtained booth and in two weeks fades away , the girl 's face was illuminated by the unflickeringlight of the promises that had been made in all the legends and fairy tales of childhood , in all the heroic novels and moving-pictures of youth , promises concerning a prince with gleaming hair and eyes a clear , Saxon blue , his flesh emblazoned with dauntless courage and tenderness and imperishable love . ( Obviously , nothing had been said in the gilt-embossed book about the loss of any of his faculties , or the manner of preparing cabbage and Wurst for him , or the necessity of cleaning his shoes . ) Whether the girl herself was fat or thin , dark-haired or blonde , was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substanceof what posed before it , and had recorded only the nimbus of untroubled hope . " Of course , I 've never seen her . I 've never laid eyes on her , as the saying goes , " the young man said with an awkward laugh , but his eyes did not share in his amusement . They still waited stubbornly , perhaps fixed on the time and the place of that other uproarious joke that had blasted his sight away . " But we 've been going out in the Tiergarten together for over a year . " ( There was a lake in the Niederstadt Tiergarten , and rowboats moved across its surface every day and evening in the summer months , and on good Sundays in the spring . All summer , the lake was visited by iridescent dragonflies , and the silk of its waters was ripped and unraveled lazily by the rising and falling of inexpert oars . Reeds grew thick as braided hair in the shallows , and the prows of the boats nosed through platforms of water lilies , roped fast by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat , the blind man , Heinrich Wagner , must have drifted on Sunday afternoons , sitting upright in the stern , narrowshouldered , pinched in the armpits by his ancient jacket , his dough-white hands holding fast to the guide-cords ofp141the rudder ; and it would have been Ursula who rowed , while he relinquished his destiny and his direction for that brief hour , but no longer , for which he had paid his nine Reichsmarks out . But he had actually relinquished nothing . Even drawing the guide-cords to right or left , as she directed , he held fast to the vanity of what he was . He could not see , as testified to by the yellow brassard on his arm , but what color was the insignia required to indicate that he was hard of hearing as well ? Had he but given ear to it , he would have heard the silvery music of the water against the rowboat 's weathered wood , and the minute collision with floating flowers and anchored vines , and heard , louder and more compelling than the thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out like bells across the lake ; if he would but listen , but he could not . If for two minutes he had lost sight of his past , and his present , and his future , and listened to the life stories of those who drifted in the other boats , the puzzled look would have been undone from his thick , black brows , and the eczema been sponged from his face . But , instead , he sat tense , narrow and rigid as a lath , his moist , red lips sealed fast at the entrance of the collapsed mine shaft of his life , fearing even the pliabilityof the reeds that bowed and flowed beneath the boat . And Ursula must have rowed docilely among the artificially constructed islands , speaking of the things about them that even sight would not have enabled him to see . " There are a great many Americans on the lake this afternoon , a great many soldiers , " she may have said to him , but it could very well have been he was counting the secondsof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his money out , and deducting the total from the sum of Ursula 's dowry , so that he could not hear so much as the whirring armor of the dragonflies . " There are German girls with some of them , " Ursula may have said to him as she rowed ,  |p142but  he so feared the other voices clanging like metal in the sun that he would not have heard if someone had shouted out that a boat is a place for the young to lie down in and taste each other 's mouths . Ursula may have added that many of them were Negroes , as their high , sweet laughter called across the water , but whatever was said , the blind man could not hear . One afternoon , there may have been more Negro G.I.s than usual out on Sunday passes , some with Frduleins in the boats with them , and some without , their khaki clingingdamp to their thighs as they rowed . But whether or not there were women with them , their flesh was alive with the need of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave running hot as lava from afternoon into dusk and on into the night . The tide of their alien love and lust must have come close to touching Heinrich Wagner as he sat like a small , bleak piece of granite in the rowboat , pulling the guide-cords to one side or the other , as Ursula bade him do . A piece of Arctic ice hacked off by the heat or the elements and set adrift bears with it a glacial aura , and in like manner Heinrich Wagner , blind as a bat and deaf as a post , must have embalmed the surrounding air with his frigidity . His grim refusal to see or hear bore them unscathedthrough the waves of laughter , and through the music that echoed across the green cavern of the lake . " Oh , sugar , sugar , I love you dearly , I do take pride in you ! " came the voices ; and : " Oh , baby , baby , I love you , love you , love you , more and more each day I live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moaned in tender anguish : " Oh , God , I do love you , Helga , Gretchen , Katerina , Klara , Ingrid ! I loves you , loves you , loves you , with all my heart ! " " There seem to be people talking somewhere around us , " Heinrich Wagner may have said then to Ursula , a young woman with full breasts and a skin without blemish , whop143rowed docilely , with bowed head . The blind man had grown uneasy because of the smell of love on the air , and because of the myriad melodious voices of savages turned restless in their jungles who now swarmed across his Lutheranworld of German continence . For it was the voice of Africa that now called to the blood in the Tiergarten , and the dark people of another continent who stretched , rutting , on the grass . What good would his cane have done him in the Bled of Africa , tapping , tapping , in panic past steaming beasts coupled in shameless embrace , through vegetation so pulsing , so living , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orchid and spreading passion-flower and rigid yucca stalk ? And Ursula , smooth-throated , sweetlipped , hearing the music that he would not hear , may have slid forward on the cross-board of the rowing-seat , and advancedone pure white , submissive leg so that her foot would just touch his . But if the blood stirred with unbearableanguish in her belly and loins , Heinrich Wagner would never have known . He sat in the stern , frozen with fear as the Dark Continent closed in on them , the spears of the warriors raised on high , the bare feet padding , drums beating , beating , beating , the rhythm of fornication unceasing , unbroken , accelerating in pace as German girls , good German girls , opened their white legs in the dusk , in the evening , to the Negroes in khaki , to pollution , to eternal shame . " Let 's get out of the sound of other people 's voices , " the blind man may have said to Ursula . " I 'd like to tell you about the subjects I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The family has four daughters at home , " Heinrich Wagnerwas telling Jaeger , " the other three older than Ursula , but they have n't any prospects yet . A small income goes with each of them , the largest to the first one to be married , so that 's Ursula . I 'm lucky to get the first one , " he said , andp144he fitted the photograph back into his wallet again . " Besides taking care of the daily household chores , a wife helps you dress , and keeps you looking presentable . If you 're writing your thesis , the way I am , she can take dictation , and that saves paying a stenographer . And then you always have someone on hand to read your reference books to you , without having to depend on friends ( who ca n't always be depended on ) , or on strangers you run into in the library , who are frequently ill-bred . There 's one thing I 'd like to speak to the Americans about , " he said . " The America House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A student has to go as far as Munich to get any books in Braille . Not many students can afford the trip , or the time taken from their studies , but the Americans do n't consider things like that . There are a number of things the Americans could be enlightened about if they ever listened to advice . " The train was traveling slowly through sunny , fertile country , and now it ground to a stop at what may have been a wayside station , although no platform , and no name of hamlet or village could be seen . " So just overnight , when the Wi hrungsref orm went through and the old lady died , I made upmy mind and set the date . " The blind man 's eyebrows knitted together in the eczema-pocked area above his nose . " The only trouble is that Ursula wants to take a honeymoon , and I ca n't spare the time from my studies for it . She wants to make an excursion to Flegendorf to see the oil well burning there . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight in from the open fields came a strappingyoung man in a wide-brimmed black felt hat , in thick black corduroys , who pushed back the sliding door and shouldered his way into the compartment where they sat . He was strong as an ox , and ruddy of face , and he carried a heavy , polished stick of spiraled wood , and a red bandana with its four ends in a knot . He said good-day in a somberp145bass , like the voice of a cello throbbing , and he laid his stick , and the tidy bundle of the bandana , on the rack above his head . Then he took a seat on the corridor side of the train . There he sat with his big raw hands hanging between his knees , like a prosperous farmer on his way to a country fair , thought Jaeger ; except that a farmer would never have let his hair grow long before his ears , like an actor 's hair , nor worn the bright loop of a gold earring in the ruddy lobe of one ear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the sound of another voice in the compartment with them . " Are you traveling to the city ? Are you going to Niederstadt on business ? " he asked . And now the cigarette was nearly done , and Jaeger leaned forward and took it from him . " Here 's another for you , " he said . " I 've got an upper story to do in Niederstadt , " said the man in black corduroy . From his outfit , it could be seen that he was a wandering carpenter , a Hamburger Zimmermann , the first one Jaeger had seen since before the war . A clean , white , collarless shirt was buttoned around his sunburned neck , and , just under the Adam 's apple , a black silk tie was fixed to the shirt by a gold pin . The long narrow tails of the tie were buttoned away inside his double-breasted , whitepipedcorduroy . " I got word the masons are almost done with their work , " the carpenter said in his deep bassoon . " I 'll get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , after the roofing , there 'll be the flooring to do throughout the house . " When Jaeger held the pack of cigarettesout to him , the young man slid toward him down the bench , and his blunt , flushed fingers fumbled a Camel out . The earring shook in his left ear as he nodded , and , holding the match for him in the sun , Jaeger saw that the tiepinbore a miniature gold compass in the triangle of its head ,  |p146and  two perfectly wrought hammers , and an infinitesimally toothed gold saw . " I 've never been to Niederstadt , " the carpentersaid , pulling a great draught of the Camel into the barrel of his chest ; " but they tell me I 'm in luck to be going there . There 're blocks and blocks of damage . That 's what they say . " His flesh looked as solid as timber that nails might be driven into and still it would not splinter or split , and there he sat with his legs spread , too big for the compartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cigarette and the work ahead a rebuke to those who complained of the grief of war . " The house was hit in 1944 , a mansion , they tell me it is , almost a palace , " he said . " That 's what my comrades in the Bruderschaft say . Next week the Maurer will get to the masonry of the private lake , and start rebuilding the swannery . It sits in a private park , so I 'll be getting a lot of sun while I do the job , " he said . " So that 's the kind of work you do , " said the blind man . He had seemed to recoil within himself from the sound of saw in wood , of trowel on stone . " As for me , I 'm a student of philosophy . " " I 'm a Zimmermann , " the carpenter boomed out . " I 'm doing the years of my Wanderschaft . I have eighteen months behind me , and eighteen months to go ! " " A colleague of mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who work with their hands instead of their heads have nothing to worry about in the future , " the blind man said . " Well , I bided my time , " said the carpenter , and he laughed out loud . " I waited to take this job in Niederstadt until the currency reform went through ! " The Wahrungsref orm , the Wdhrungsre f orm , went the recurringmotif of it , stated either in celebration or lament ,  |p147as  the poem of the Lorelei might be sung , or any true German refrain . It was coins jingling in the pocket again , the Wdhrungsref orm , or else it was pockets turned inside out so that only the holes in them showed . It was hornpipe or requiem , cancan or dirge , depending on the zest of the musician , or his liver , and the key in which the air was played . And Jaeger was uncertain now what to do with the holiday spirit of the morning , and the careless whistling through his teeth about love . " How long will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not more than six months . That 's the time we 're allowed to stay in one place , " said the carpenter . " After six months , we 're bound in honor to move on . " The blind man was suddenly flayed anew by the hunger for name and dogma and destination , for the explicitly stated direction that one man might be taking who could see with his own eyes the choice of ways to go . Stop time , stop the recovery of the country ! he might have been crying out . Stop the money changing in the bank vaults ! It is all going on without me ! It is leaving me behind ! Ohne mich , ohne 7nich ! he might have been whispering to the rhythm of the wheels that bore them on . " Have the Zimmerleute any religious creed ? " he asked , and his hands moved nervously . " Have they a political party to which they adhere ? " " Nay , nay ! " the carpenter 's voice thundered out . " We 're like no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 've always been . The rules were laid down for us in the seventeenth century , and we bide by them still . We 're bound in honor to dress as we dress , " he said . The light stubble on his chin and jaws was turned bright golden by the sun . " This necktie of mine , it 's called Ehrbarkeit . Itp148ca n't be bought . Each one of us earns it through apprenticeship . It 's a symbol of our honor , " he said , and his fingers touched it as if it was a relic of the Holy Grail . " How do you Zimmerleute look on the institution of marriage ? " the blind man asked . He sat looking straight ahead . " Ah , we 're bound not to marry , too ! " said the carpenter in his strong , happy voice . " For the three years of the Wanderschaf t , we may none of us take a wife ! " He was not unlike a knight , with the armor laid aside , thought Jaeger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , guild member in a year when guilds must learn to die . Where are you going , wandering carpenter ? he might be asked , and the answer would lead back through the centuries , ever further and further back through history . " We still use words that our grandfathers and great-grandfathers used , and that other Germans do n't know the meaning of , " the carpenter said , pride warm and simple in his face . " We 're like flying birds ! We wing from one place to another . You can see the birds printed there on my neckerchief . " He raised one hand , with the Camel between the fingers of it , toward the rack . " They 're the emblem of our Wanderschaf t . " " I am unable to see your tie or your neckerchief , " the blind man said . His brows went even blacker across his face . " But what kind of religion have you ? As a man , a Zimmermann , what is your relationship to God ? " " We are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the carpenter , confounded a moment . " We 're free men , footloose and free . " If his voice had seemed uncertain in the instant that he evaded God , now it boomed out richly , deeply , again . " We carry everything we own in our neckerchiefs . What we are is stamped in pictures on it , clear enough for everyone to understand . " He stood up , giant/sized , awkward-limbed , and reached the bandana down from the rack , and he turned it , knotted full with his belongings , before Jaeger and the blindman in the sun . A procession of men in flaring corduroy trousers , in broadbrimmedfelt hats , or in stovepipe hats , marched single file across the red and white cotton stuff of it , across the map of Europe , and Asia , and Africa , as well . They were mighty men , bearing gnarled sticks in their right hands , and Tsquaresand knotted neckerchiefs under their arms , and some had the small loop of a single earring in one ear . " We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as Africa to the south ! " the carpenter told them in eagerness , wantingeven the blind to be enabled to see the procession of men who moved , identically equipped , forever freed of the burden of disparate identity . Jaeger wished to speak then , perhaps merely to say that he , too , was wounded , defeated man , and that he had taken America as bastille , and a package of Camels as amulet . But he did not speak , for now the train had slowed almost to a halt , and high , tangled banks of rusted rails could be seen outside the window , twisted , and broken , and cast aside , it seemed , by idiot children 's frenzied hands . As if undetonatedbombs lay buried still between the ties , or the area ahead was mined , the engine felt its way cautiously down the complexities of temporary track , switching to right and left , grinding over makeshift trestles ( intact , and newly painted , and manufactured in the U.S.A. ) , over excavationsof ash and slag , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ High on the sepulchral mounds of track lay the bodies of locomotives , cremated where they fell , and railway carriages with their roofs wrenched viciously away , the blisters from long-cooled fires unbroken on their metal flanks , their windows gaping , as they had gaped for three years now , on the chaos of cloth and bone , wire and leather ,  |p150man  and inanimate matter , lying compounded , inextricable , within . All that had had specific meaning once , now lay meaningless around them ; all that had once had functionand destination was twisted into so grotesque a shape that even the intention of man seemed driveling lunacy . As the train entered the dark shadow of the station , Jaeger called it in silence the city of three shattered domes : that of the railway station , and of the opera house , and the cathedralthat stood bleak against the sky . " It is difficult to put much faith in the international summerseminar the Americans have organized at the University , " the blind student said , his face puzzled under the stubborn black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes of what it will do for peace , world peace . But we had international seminars under Hitler , too , and even with American and English students here every year , summer after summer , it did n't swing those countries to our side when the war came . " On his way to the Military Government building , Jaegerbegan his letter to Catherine Roberts . He wrote it senselessly , almost without reflection , in haste , the words racing back and forth across the broken faces of the houses , and up and down staircases that led to nothing , suspended in mid-air by ropes of ivy and ladders of honeysuckle vine . He scribbled it across the scarred enamel of two or three bathtubs that hung by their pipes from upper stories , sentencefollowing sentence ( in English ) over the split panels of closet doors that war had blasted into public view . " Dear Mrs. Roberts , " he began it in the soft beauty of the day , with a semblance of respect and reason in the opening lines . " Since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has affected me as well as the economic system , and I am suddenly on fire withp151hope , impatience , and satiable desires . Something has changed overnight in the air as well as on paper and behind the barred doors and windows of banks ; something has at last come to a definite end in this country which means that something else is just about to start taking place . I tell you , I have never felt so strongly in my life that a burden has been taken from me and that I have reached the end of carryingaround for the rest of my life the weight of conformity my father decided to leave me as heritage out of his bag of sad official tricks . I see myself throwing everything to the winds , everything , as if they were yesterday 's banknotes , preconceived notions , prejudice , obligations ( monetary or any other kind ) . My concerns , dearest , beloved , perfumed Catherine Roberts , " he wrote faster and faster across the rubble of brick and rusted girders and marble fragments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the Landeskreditanstaltonce , " have all been devaluated , and because I no longer feel any responsibilities to any tomorrows , I want with all my furiously burning flesh to sleep a sweet , illicit sleep with you whenever I can manage it and however often it can be done . Not for a moment am I going to permitthe halt or the blind or the old who have elected to stay in bed for the rest of their lives because they do n't happen to like the size their pensions have shrunk to  --  oh , not for a moment am I going to allow them to impose their burdens on me ! I have had enough of being humble and poor and  --  what ? patronized ? Is that what I have been accepting from you ? Some men were made for solemn occasions , were cut out for ponderous decisions and grave reflectionsthat followed on the ponderous decisions they had taken ( or put it the other way around ) , and I know , since a clear wind has begun to blow around me , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoner of war suited me better than anything I 'd ever done , amputating as it didp152the free will and relieving me of the necessity of taking a stand . Once the question came up in Colorado as to American soldiers saluting the German officers who were impounded with us , and this called for a profound searchingof national ( but not personal , individual ) pride , for the decision reached must be based on international law and the Geneva Conventions instead of the taste of honeysuckle , and I had no base from which to spring erect and had therefore nothing to say on the subject , largely because I was accorded , or enjoyed ( the word must be polite ) , PX privileges like any G.I. , and was issued clothes and shoes . ( Shoes ! Do you hear that , feet ? ) I was as good as any memberof the United States Armed Forces , if not better , and had two pairs of general-issue shoes , fatigue and dress , and if I was guilty of anything it was of not bursting into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faced . Only since the monetary reform do I know that I should have split my sides over the business of a man , any man , clapping his heels together and raising his hand to his ternplein acknowledgment of the presence of a man who wears a more expensive uniform than his . To raise the hand to the temple in order to put an end to things would be a saner act . Once or twice , let it be put down to my credit , I gave an uneasy smile at the sight of the crew members of a capturedGerman submarine doing setting-up exercises , shoulderingarms , submerging and emerging , in the Colorado air ( thirty or forty below and three miles above sea level ) with German submarine officers barking the nautical orders out . But I had not yet begun to laugh . " Crossing the avenue along which chestnut trees , bomb-crippled but living still , raised the stumps of their arms to the sky , he wrote : " Catherine , Catherine , Catherine , " on the wide stone steps that led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and drew a heart around each name ,  |p153and  across the unscarred granite face of the building itself he continued writing : " I can probe none of the shallows or depths of your relation to husband , daughter , or foreigner , Catherine , my beloved , for all my responsibilities to other men have been devaluated ten to one , or one to ten , and become discredited currency . I have now inherited a fortune , and the new coins of it are the words I will murmur into your ears as we lie together at night in some rented room , some hotel bed , and the words that you will give me in exchange in hot , separate instants of passion , against my mouth  --  " But he did not reach the end , for just inside the marblepavedentrance hall , by the imported water-cooler , a man stood , and he knew he must quiet the tumult in his blood . His features were not discernible in the first moment of indoor obscurity , but as Jaeger moved across the hall , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalled a troubled incident somewhere when questions were asked and not quite answered in a room , perhaps a kitchen , that was uneasy because Catherine Roberts was not there . " I did n't know you covered this territory , too , " the silhouettesaid , and Jaeger knew the voice , and the convex brace of teeth . It was Overstreet , wearing a pepper-and-salt suit , chosen perhaps , it occurred to Jaeger , for the homespun look of it , at the American Clothing Store at Round-Up Circle ( which the Germans persisted in calling Bismarckplatzstill ) . Jaeger said he had come to cover the hearing that was just about to begin , and he would have moved on up the stairs then , but Overstreet chuckled behind his teeth . " Oh , the Irishman from Milwaukee ! " he said . He went on saying in a lowered voice : " I can give you some inside angles on it that might interest you . Come into my office for a minute and I 'll sketch the background in . " The door closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chair , and he himself sat down on the other side of the bare desk . Canvas awnings of faded green were lowered at the two windows , and the room was cool , almost dark , with two yellow slats of outside light lying on the window sills . Jaeger took what was left of the pack of Camels from his pocket . As he lit one , Overstreet pulled open a desk drawer . " That the brand you prefer ? " he said , not actually smiling , perhaps , but the upper lip drawn back so long a time from habit that there was difficulty now in bringing it down over the glistening gum . " I 've got quite a selection here , " he said . He proved it by pushing five different packs across the flat top of the desk . But Jaeger did not seem to see them . He looked at the watch on his wrist , and laid the match on the edge of the ash tray . And now Overstreet leaned his elbows on the arms of his chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the short fingers making a scaffolding , a church spire , which he balanced against the square of teeth and gum . He began saying there was an even better story to cover than the one that was being staged upstairs , and that was the story of the oil well that had caught fire two weeks ago down near Flegendorf . He said it was burning still , and that people were driving from as far away as Munich to have a look at it , and sightseers ' cars were parked for miles around . His eyes are like that fox 's eyes , Jaeger thought suddenly ; like the fox I saw that evening from the Hochsitz , after the kill . No white had shown in the fox 's eye , but over the barricade of fingers laid tip to tip , there was in the man 's eyes a rim of white , convexlike the teeth , and in them , as in the fox 's , the black and yellow iris was curved like the narrow body of a wasp , stabbing and stabbing its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a lot of drama and human interest in it , a local story , but one that could be blown up as big as the cur/rency reform , if a good journalist got hold of it , " Overstreet said . " Well , we have a man down there covering it , " said Jaeger . " We 've been running a column on it every day . We 've comparedit to the Hindenburg disaster , and to the Transylvania gas-well fire in 1934 , when subterranean gases burned five years or more . Our man has done quite a piece of research on it . He 's gone into descriptions of how the peasants in that part of Transylvania had no need to stop their plowing when the sun went down , because it stayed light for five years , night and day . And it stayed warm , so the vegetation changed , and the migration of birds , and the lamps in that area were put in the attic , because the fire lit up the countryside . Couples used to go there on their honeymoons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the States . " Jaeger stood up now . " I 'll have to be getting up to the courtroom , " he said . " If you look at today 's edition of the Fahrbach Presse , you 'll see a cut that our man dug up somewhere of Transylvania children playing in the fields , with the information that the photograph was taken at eleven o'clock at night , and that the fields were growing with rose-pink grass . " He moved toward the door , aware of his height , and the bigness of his bones . " But thanks for the suggestionjust the same , " he said . " I tell you what . I 'll drive you down to Flegendorf , " Overstreet said , and he , too , got to his feet . " It 's a sight nobody should miss . It wo n't take any time at all . We can make it in an hour , there and back . " With one small , nimble hand , he indicated the five packs of cigarettes lyingon the desk . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you take a carton , " he said , but Jaeger was already at the door . " I 'll have to get on with that story upstairs , " he said . " But that 's just it : there is n't any story , " said Overstreet.  |p156He  stood beside Jaeger now , the pepper-and-salt of the suit of a piece with the pepper-and-salt of his close-cropped hair , so that it was like the coat of an animal fitted neatly over his bones . " I tell you , it 's the case history of a nut . That 's all it is , " he said , with his marmot grin . " If Legal Division sees fit to let the German press in on it , then Intelligence has to get busy . I 've already had to turn three local reportersaway . The Germans do n't need to know about that kid from Milwaukee . He 's some kind of a social misfit , a religious fanatic . He 's something the German press should leave alone . " Now they were in the entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pavings under their soles . Before them , in a shaft of light from the glass dome overhead , was the white fan of the stairs , and high , in the four corners of the hall , were clusters of American flags , parade flags , with their gilded staffs crossed like spears , and their giddy stripes hanging in incongruously grave folds . " This is an assignment . My paper sent me down , " Jaeger said . His will had turned hard as metal in him . So I 'm afraid of these men of the Occupation , he thought . That 's what 's the matter with me . I 'm afraid of these Americans whom victory has made too much like other men . They 're not the ones I knew during the war . For half a carton of cigarettes , I 'm expected to do exactly what is asked , and I might have done it , a month ago I might have done it , calling it by a bettername , not wanting to face that defeat makes cowards and lackeys of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read the story anyway in The Stars and Stripes , " he said , and he started up the stairs . " The Stars and Stripes is n't read by every German in Hesse , " Overstreet said . He mounted as Jaeger mounted , not touching his arm , but holding him , step by step , by the persistance of his voice , his smile , not letting him get away.  | " Let me tell you this . " In the unabashed light the freckles stood on his forehead like sweat . " That business going on up there is typical of nothing at all , representing no race or class in America , no state in the union , either North or South . The kid ought to be in the loony bin . But Legal Division is n't Intelligence . They would n't know . " Into the conflict of this bounded Honerkamp , leaving behind him the shadows of the upper hall , jumping , running , fleeing down , as if the pack were at his heels . His eyes were fixed on something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , and so for a moment he did not see them , and then he stopped short a step above them , his breath coming fast . " Hi , Jaeger , hi , Overstreet ! " he cried out , gay as a cricket , or so it seemed , in his unpressed flannels , his unshined shoes , his tan jacket flapping wide . But the mask of worry could be seen , fixed fierce and small on the plump young face , blightingthe look of earnestness with adult chagrin . " How did you get down from Fahrbach , Jaeger ? " he asked , and Jaeger told him he had come by train . " Damn it , you could have driven down with me ! " He snapped his thumb and finger in annoyance . " I had Mrs. Roberts and Millicent as passengers . My driver 's taken them down to Flegendorf to see the oil well that caught fire . " " That 's a first-rate story , " Overstreet said . He divided the sight of his brace of teeth between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if with laughter , taking in Honerkamp , then Jaeger , then Honerkamp again . " What about riding back with us ? " Honerkamp said . " Can you be at the Press Club at four thirty ? Just go in and wait at the bar . " " Well , the weather seems to be very nice , so I 'll wait outside the Press Club , " Jaeger said . He felt the bloodp158rising under his ears , spreading across his Adam 's apple , moving up over his jaws . " I 'll wait on the steps , " he said . " Damn it , yes . I 'm forgetting regulations again . Yes . Outside , then , " Honerkamp said . He stood silent a moment , his eyes bleak , his fingers scratching uncertainly at his hair . " Look , Overstreet , " he said , " I 'm in the process of evading something , and I do n't like the feel of it . That 's why I 'm running . I 've been trying for a week to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milwaukee , but it seems I 've got the wrong credentials . It does n't do any good to be a human being . You have to be an M.P . before they 'll let you in the same room with him . " He gave a short , dry laugh . " I 'm staying out of that courtroom now because I do n't want to sit and listen without protest to what he 's going to say . " " I 'm glad you 're with me on that , Seth , " Overstreet said . " I 've been telling Herr Jaeger here that there 's no reason why the press  --  " " Good God , no , the press has got to go in ! " Honerkamp said . " The press is something else . It belongs to the public domain . I 'm just an intruder from Information Services wanting to give some advice to a kid before he stands up there in the courtroom and throws whatever he is away . " " They 'll give him twenty , thirty , years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , the long teeth longer , almost diabolicalnow . " Except there was n't any crime , " said Honerkamp . " He was shipped over too young , too soon , at the wrong time of year . The winter of 1946 was n't pretty over here . There were skeletons , Overstreet , and there was hunger walking around , and the sound of the dying made a rattling noise in the cold . It was n't like Milwaukee . It was n't like anything he 'd ever seen . "  | " When they talk about getting a lawyer for him , " Overstreetsaid , " he shuts up like a clam . " " Something went wrong in the set-up at home . " Honerkampstood on the step above them , talking fast . " His mother remarried , and so he felt kicked in the seat of the pants by maternal love . He got over here , and he did n't want to go home again , because Germany did not hesitate to take him to her womanly breast . Germany needed him badly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so did the German family he got mixed up with in Niederstadt . No girl involved . Nothing like that , " Honerkamp said to Jaeger now . " He wanted a home , a mama , a country he could rock in his arms . " Overstreet pulled at his shirt cuffs with his little sawed-off hands . He said : " What kind of a picture would that give of American home life smeared all over the front page ? " " That is n't why he should be kept from saying what he 's going to say , " Honerkamp said , the mask gone tight and desperate now . " He 's going to get up and say he wants to throw over his nationality , that he wants to become a Germancitizen . " As he turned to look up at the courtroom door , his face seemed leavened to absurd and unexpected nobility . " The German mother and father he wanted  --  and had  --  and the three German teen-age kids he could bring his PX candy to , that was all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depot for them , stealing coal , and firewood , and flour , and coffee , and sugar , and anything else they needed  --  blankets even  --  that was all right too . And when the army caught up with him , they had no choice , they shipped him home . But by that time  --  that was 1947 , last year  --  or maybe from the first day he put foot on Germansoil , this was his home , these were his people , " Honerkampsaid , " and he was n't going to stay away . "  | " He stowed away three times , " Overstreet said , and now it had become like a duel between them . His teeth bit down on his lip in sudden gravity . " Intelligence picked him up at Hamburg every time , except the last . On the fourth try , he got through . " " That must have been when you were on vacation , " Honerkamp said , and he gave the short , queer laugh again , but Overstreet paid no heed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He 's charged with illegal entry into Germany . " " And now he will get up and say under oath that he wants to renounce his citizenship , having already said it in the privacyof the stockade . And what will that do to the rest of his life ? " Honerkamp said . " I tell you , it 's going to echo inside him and outside him until kingdom come . There it'lI be , between him and himself , between him and every man  --  or woman , either  --  who comes his way , and no sense to it . He 's not a political refugee . Jaeger , " he said . He shook himself as if shaking himself awake . " You 'd better get into the courtroom quick and hear it all . You can write about it . I can think about it . There 's nothing else we can do . " " Yes , " said Jaeger in a low voice . " There 's one thing . I could always exchange identities with him . I could try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Honerkamp said . " It 's perhaps the closest thing to death there is . Do n't you feel how close it comes ? " he asked , and he touched Jaeger 's shoulder gently , as a woman might , his face bemused , as Jaeger went past him up the stairs . But the opportunity to exchange identities was never offered , for the courtroom doors of Military Government were not to be opened to latecomers once the hearing got under way . Nor was the story of the boy from Milwaukee to makep161the front pages of the local press , for , in the middle of the afternoon , a thing occurred which editors , despite tall stories that had appeared from time to time , maintained had no precedent in history . Photographs of those who played the leading roles in it , and factual accounts of the sequence of its incidents , replete with stories by half-hysterical eyewitnesses , packed column after newspaper column the next day . It was something that those who were passing in the street at the moment it happened would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a shadow , as the knowledge that one must die casts a shadow upon the brilliant clarity of daily life , lighter or darker in intensity according to the day , the season , but fixed , immutable , forever , in some halted time and designated place . Jaeger was one of those who was passingat the instant the first dust rose . He was on his way to the Press Club , taking it leisurely , with an hour to spare , thinking that from the paper 's point of view he had come a long way for nothing at all . You could always have gone to the Gerichtshof and talked to the DistrictAttorney about what local Nazi trials are coming up , he said to himself , walking past the lawns , the honeycombed glass , the stark functionalism of the O. H. Spaltenindustrie ( the fortress of industry that no bomb had ever grazed , although , for blocks around , parks , dwelling-places , mansions , lay in ruins still ) , seeing the two hundred or more windowpanesablaze with the reflection of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unscathed by war seemed now to be blazing from within . Schumacher would have been pleased at the evidence of your initiative , he thought , and he considered a feature story on the agenda of the city 's conscience , German judging German in a local court of law . Instead , he had gone to the public gardens and wandered through the fragrant aisles of the orchid house , merely , he told himself , to dream in the heat , as poets dream , but , oncep162there , he had found in the flowers the shape and texture of Catherine Roberts ' face . Even her coloring could be seen in a blue-veined white orchid , its scroll as clear and lovely as a bugle call , that reached out of the jungle swelter of bracken and maidenhair . Two snickering G.I.s had stopped before this separate flower , one eating boxed crackerjack and the other hitting at the suspended , flowering roots , gnarled like sinews , until they swung crazily above their heads . When the soldiers had moved on around a bend of crisp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single-veinedflower . The hanging , exotically leafed roots were nearly motionless again , the steam of the tropics rose from the beds , and moisture was beaded on the glass panes of the roof , the walls . " Catherine , sweet love , " Jaeger whispered to the flower , and then he saw the piece of sugared popcorn that the G.I. had dropped into the orchid 's open throat . In the street now , he passed the sloping lawns of the O. H. Spaltenindustrie , the green slopes broken by formal flower beds in circles , triangles , squares ( the pattern set like a child 's beaded game , the texture of petal and leaf as tawdry as plastic ) . The short , combed grass was watered by sprays that twisted and wove like long-armed spiders , and cast bright rainbows right and left in the sun . Here was the establishedhub of the Occupation 's life , here in this building , Jaeger knew , with American flags fixed at every turn and wing of it , and one great banner hanging high on the flagstaffthat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wheel of the Occupation turned as the brass sprays turned , as the glass doors turned to let those in uniform and others in civilian dress , pass in and out . A constantly revolvingflow of cars moved , gleaming , up the curved driveway , stopped briefly at the entrance , and wheeled on , completingthe sphere . And Jaeger felt his own life turning andp163returning to the knowledge that , in one hour , less now , he would be with her , breathing the same air into his lungs that she had held in hers , listening , listening , the spell cast like a silken veil upon him as she spoke . Whoever is sitting in the third-class carriages as the train pulls out has nothing to do with me , he thought , for I shall not be with them . I shall be riding with Milly , with Honerkamp , with Catherine , my love , telling them that my responsibilities to my fellow man have been devaluated , and that my solemnity has withered forever on the stalk . He liked the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rabelais , who would , had he been High Commissioner , have had engraved over the portals of the O.H . Spalten building : " Here enter not attorneys , barristers , nor bridle-champing law-practitioners ; clerks , commissaries , scribes , nor pharisees , willful disturbers of the people'sease " ; aware in abrupt impatience that he did not know Rabelais in French , that he did not , with any degree of certainty , know French , and that it was to be learned , it must be learned ( perhaps in classes at the America House ) , if he was to be the wit , the poet , the multiple-tongued man . If only for two hours on the Autobahn , I shall be rid of Germanyagain , he said to himself as he walked straight toward the sun . And then he saw what had happened to the power shovel on the other side of the street . It had been digging in the rubble , as on every other day of its life , lifting debris in its hinged jaws , chains jerking , neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crumpled plumbing into open trucks drawn up at the curb ; until the foundations under its treads had caved in , and down had gone the heavy forefront , gone deeply into the cellar without a cry , and the heavy , rattling jaws were still . The reddish dust of pulverized brick and tile was just settlingas Jaeger crossed the street , and he could see the face of a man at the window of the shovel 's cab . Both doors werep164wedged fast in the chaotic sea of twisted girders and blasted masonry , and here was the strangely perishable face behind the glass . In another minute , the whole contraption might ' go under , as a ditched airplane is given its moment of respitebefore the sea sucks it finally to its heart . Even the ' weight of a footstep , the vibration of a voice , thought Jaeger , might send the whole thing down . But still he made his way over the choppy waves of tossed cement , and when he was near to the cab , he knelt in the precarious rubble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction of the pane . " Try to get it open . So that you 'll have air . I do n't want to risk breaking the glass . " The shovel , with its reaching , retching neck , was balanced over a chasm far deeper than any cellar . To Jaeger , it seemed that the bowels of the earth had opened , and now the damp , fetid smell of the rankness of the earth rose from the entrails and rot that steamed in the dark below . From the street behind him , the voices of men called out , truck-drivers , their trucks loaded with the refuse of houses that men had built and men had destroyed , excavators , passers-by , calling to Jaeger to return , to crawl back , his life intact , across the treacherously slipping mass . But he had lit a Camel for the man trapped in the cab , and he reached over the moraine of broken fortifications to pass it to him through the inch that was open now above the cautiously lowered glass . He knelt on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispering across the little distance between life and death some hastily conceived fable about the economic advantages of the monetaryreform , telling with such eloquence of the miracle that had taken place in the counting-houses of Germany that the whole story seemed credible to him now . The wondrous reform of money , the freshly minted Wdhrungsreform , he kept saying , the syllables like notes plucked on the strings ofp65a harp . He talked of vacations that might now be taken , trips to the Taunus hills , to the Black Forest , men , and their wives and their children with them , the words whispered in promise to the face behind the pane , offered as rewardto the working-class of Germany if one man would agree to expand his lungs and take in the air of June while it was still available , and hold on to it even if the craft went down . It might be that the prosperity of the country depended on one frightened man 's determination to survive . And then the crowd parted to let the police pass . After them came the wailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The wrecking-crane came late , feeling its way along the curb , across the sidewalk , like a primordial beast , its grappling-hook swinging right and left . It established its position on the mounds of chaos , and extended its yellow iron neck . The crowd stood quiet as the hook began its descent . The chains that held it reeled and unreeled , and it hung there a moment , immediately above the cab , and Jaegerand the helmeted police drew back from its reach . Down it swung , curved fingers extended , seeking above the rubble as a hand might seek , and in the instant before it closed upon the cab , the shocking thing that could not happen now took place . Out of the cellar 's , or the earth 's , dark , fetid depths came a figure . It moved like a spider caught in its own web , like a broken crab , clawing its frantic way up through the rusted girders and disjointed stones . Wild as a scarecrow in the wind , it came , far wilder because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man trapped in the cab of his claim to drama , reducing his situation to merely another facet of the human predicament , as it scrambledinto the light . It emerged in all its panic and frenzy within touch of Jaeger 's hand , dislodging fragments of debris that rippled in small avalanches back into the depths , andp166Jaeger stood astounded only because he knew the entire story , had read it in newspapers half a dozen times , and dismissedit , and now must watch it taking place . Exactly as in every account , whether from Danzig , or Munich , or Warsaw , the rags of a Wehrmacht uniform clung to the figure 's bones , the sleeves , the trousers , hanging in shreds , slashed back and forth and up and down by outragedtime . A soiled , discolored beard hung to its waist , and the long , greenish locks of hair on its head mingled upon its shoulders with epaulettes of dust . Filth rendered indecipherablethe insignia that had once designated rank , and blackened the medals that had testified to the valor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an emissary from the earth 's exuding heart , a revenant from a war lost three years before , swaying , babbling , shaking , gesticulating , saluting , seeing nothing in the bright blaze of the lowering sun . The story enacted now was no more than a rumored tale , like that of the Indian rope trick , never quite seen and never once caught on photographic film , although countless cameralenses had snapped open and closed before it . As the hero of it balanced upright above the rubble , a murmur of horror rose from the throats of the people gathered in the street . " Russians ? Comrades ? " the voice croaked from the boneyardof the hero 's breast . He raised his fleshless , bleached arms on high , his hands held weaponless above his head . " I surrender ! I surrender ! " his voice echoed hollowly out of the long unbroken silence of the tomb . This was the story the papers carried under banner headlinesthe next day , if only because myth had been given the flesh of reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they read the items printed from time to time about a rain of small frogs falling , or clouds of locusts darkening the sun , but now it had actually taken place in a street theyp167knew in the week of the resurrection of the currency . Beforethe scarecrow was carried off in the ambulance ( usurpingthe rightful place of the man in the power shovel 's cab ) , he said this much : there had been five of them in the airraidshelter that April morning in 1944 when the bombers had come over , and the falling houses had sealed the five of them in . And then the tears poured from his eyes , and he wept uncontrollably as the interns helped him the long way across the rubble to the street , even his slobbering mouth seeming to weep its own mad tears . The others had died , two in the first year ( or so the survivors had calculated it ) , and two much later . Not of hunger , for the shelter had been a food reserve , and the shelves in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he clawed his way up into the light . One corridor ran as far as the opera house . He was sure of that , for once in the daily , interminable walks , he and the others , scratching for exit , had found a cello bow , and the bones of fingers interred with it above their heads . The halls contained drums of water , bottles of Schnapps and vinegar , tins of oil , all still untouched ; and barrels of flour that he had eaten in handfuls with the rats  --  and eaten the rats when he could get them . Once he had had a toothache , and he had dug the tooth out of his jaw with his army knife , he said . Then the ambulance door closed on the filthy , wooden clotheshorse that he was , lying shaking and sobbing on the snowy pillow and pallet , between the internsin starched white coats . Jaeger stayed until the crane had raised the power shovel and the scarcely remembered driver had been freed ; waited until the ambulance had returned to bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed the streets that led to the station , and in the anonymity of its destruction he sat down to write the story while he waited for the Fahrbach train . It was not that he had made a choice . It was merely that thep168Press Club had gone from his mind ; that Americans were waiting for him to ride with them was now effaced . He wrote methodically , in a kind of benumbed , halted grief , saying that each of them , every German , must claw his way out of the depths of what he was , letting the faded , filth-encrusted insignia fall from him , and the medals for military valor drop away . When the time came , Jaeger went like any other Germaninto the destitution of the third-class carriages . After a while , as the train moved up the valley , be slept , and when he awoke there was dark at the windows , and on his heart , like a weeping woman , lay the terrible burden of Germany.  |p169This  timeit was a larger hunting-party that set out at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was the Colonel at the wheel , and Stephany beside him , and Milly between Jaeger and Honerkamp on the seat behind . Jaeger had been summoned by telephone to come , and no word was said of Catherine Roberts ; but now , as they drove through the flowering country , Honerkamp spoke uneasily of Paris , seeming to fear even the sound of the illicit , Gallic word in his mouth . Without him saying the rest , Jaeger knew from the stillness of Milly 's profile , from the authority in the Colonel 's shoulders riding ahead , that Catherine Robertshad gone  --  gone to meet her brother , to buy new clothes , to stay for a week in Paris and forget the taste of Germany , Honerkamp said little by little , in intervals , as they drove . Her going might have been the signal given at last , for the Colonel had lost no time in planning his campaign and mobilizinghis men . The force he had mustered was to spend the entire day at Ober-Pastau , mapping out the lie of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eveningwould begin . By the time dusk fell , he said , driving fast through the metallic sunlight , every cow-path out of the village , every entry to the forest , would be patrolled . " We 'll draw the net tight around the bastards at last , " he said . " Referring to civilians or beasts , sir ? " Honerkamp asked . " Referring to both , " said the Colonel , his tone genial andlight despite the color smoldering , not flaming yet , in theflesh packed in his neck . " This time we 're after renegadehunters and renegade swine . I 've had enough of both , " hep170said , pleased beyond measure with the look of things ahead . " That boar who stampedes through the village streets sounds like something out of the stone age , " Stephany said . Here he was , the cheerful young subordinate , his mustache and hair agleam with life , turning now to inform the others of what the Colonel already knew . " Knau called me yesterday . He said it was seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bull . Not having any guns , they set the dogs on it , and it tossed one  --  tore it open , they say  --  before it was driven back into the woods . " " Oh , I 've been reading about the mythic beasts ! " Honerkampsaid , leaning forward in the car . " There 's a tremendousone in Irish chronicles who was fattened for seven years on the flesh of fifty cows per year , and it took the strength of sixty men to lift its tail . " " The common or garden variety of boar is not carnivorous , or so I 've been told , " the Colonel said pleasantly , forbearingly , for nothing must spoil the established mood and plan . " Is there any information available in your books , Seth , as to the date when the boar took up eating chestnuts and truffles and gave up his diet of steak ? " When he put the next question to Stephany , the sarcasm was gone . " What nights did Knau say the jeep had been out ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the briefing of his men . " They set a record this week , the deer-jackers , " said Stephany , half turned in his seat to say it to the girl . " They came out twice , and the tommy-guns were blazing . WheneverKnau was nearly up with them , they moved on . Thursday , the stream was streaked with blood , Knau said , and yesterdaymorning , early , he found a dying deer . " " I 've had enough of it , " said the Colonel , keeping his shoulders quiet , however much they wanted to toss and turn under the weight of man 's violation of this terrain held underthe Occupation in his name.  |p171In  the courtyard of every house in the village was a manure pile , liquid as a bank of moss is in the spring , but golden in color , and each courtyard was identically bounded on three sides by house , and stable , and granary . The cobbles , the benches by the doorsteps , the besoms of cut brush , all were alike , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen , stall after stall of them , in the lightdappledquiet beyond reach of the sun . The pigsties were placed between cattle and granary , and in them great , longleggedpigs grunted and throttled on their fat , their ears erect as they shouldered their way to the soiled picket gates to watch the car rock past . Only the tints of the geraniums in the window boxes varied , or , at times , the mesh of the crocheted curtains behind the dollhouse-sized panes . And only the forester 's house had glazed tiles set along its cornice , picturing in primal colors the flowers and grains of the crops that followed one upon the other from spring , through summer , into wealthy autumn . They who came in the emeraldstation wagon had nothing to offer to men who lived in this enduring prosperity  --  nothing , thought Jaeger , but the fleeting gift of three rounds of ammunition and the night 's loan of a gun . Yet it was for these modest dispensationsthat Knau jumped up from the kitchen table when the Colonel brought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Many cows , much milk and butter , " Honerkamp said in his brash German to the forester . He and the others had stepped down onto the courtyard cobbles in the sun . " Ja , ja , but no horses ! " Knau cried out in complaint . On the doorstep behind him , a silky-haired dachshund , with a face as lively as a lawyer 's , watched the strangers with bright , humorous eyes . " They took the horses away during the war , and paid us half of what they were worth . I had four of them . Good horses , too ! And then they expected us top173join their Party and fight their war for them ! " he said . He stood shaking his head at the effrontery of it , his black felt hat set low , sealed permanently to his brow , it seemed ; as much a part of him as his black-haired ears , and no more to be removed than were the ears , either for bath , or bed , or love-making , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blond , silky tail , and the mesh curtains at one window moved . There , the faces of two children watched through the geranium stalks and leaves , their grave eyes on the strangers and the car . " There 's going to be a horse fair in Kneith in September . The first since the war , " Jaeger said in German . And now , perhaps because the talk was of horses , he glanced shyly at the girl . She was standing beside the Colonel , her head lowered , and when Jaeger repeated the words , tentatively , in English to her , she looked up across the bold , Germanic sunlight at him , but neither of them gave a sign . Whatever they knew of horses , and the rage of loneliness , and love , it was a knowledge they must share in secret , for the others standing in the courtyard could not know of the tenderness that filled their hearts . Christoph ! she may have wished to call across the tide of sun to Jaeger , but her lips did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in his pain : Why did she have to go to Paris ? For God 's sake , what is she doingthere ? But , instead , he went on saying in English : " The peasants have never wanted for anything . " " There 's a fatted bull in there , too heavy to stand , " Honerkampsaid , shading his eyes to look across the courtyard to the stalls . " The entire village will have to carry it to the cattlefair and prop it up against a wall . " " It was n't easy for a man to know what to do , " Knau said to Jaeger , for all of them had turned their eyes now to the monstrous , sleek-coated beast lying in an angle of sun on its bed of straw . " There was n't any sense in putting him upp173for sale before the Wahrungsreform , " he went on in loud , bleak complaint . " It would have been throwing so much money down the drain . " The sun smote their brows and blinded them with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heat . Each thought in his head seemed like a rudderless ship adrift on the unrippled brilliance of the courtyard ; and one thought was that it was not like the Colorado sun , for this German sun halted against the boundaries of wall , or roof , or measurable distance , while the sun in Colorado went racing up cliffs , blazed its way over mountains , careened down canyons , leaped rapids , with a transparency that drenched the heart . Another thought was that German painters who escaped , by some miracle , to the south of France , or to Italy , or Spain , or Greece , could not accustom their eyes or senses to the ephemeral light , and could not put brush to canvas in their uncertainty . And still another of these thoughts that drifted without direction was that race horses , when taken to other countries , for the first long week can not gauge the slope of the land or the height of hurdles , and stumble and fall and break their necks in : the foreign light . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courtyard now it was like a door of solid gold that closed them in . " They held up their Wahrungsreform so long that the bull is nearly dead of overeating , " Knau said .. " If he ca n't stand up , what kind of a price am I going to get for him ? It 's hard in times like these , I tell you , for a man of conscience to know what he 's to do . " And now Knau 's wife , in her Hessian peasant dress , had come to the door with a pail of freshly washed potatoes in her hand . She was young , not more than thirty-five , perhaps , and her tan hair was drawn up in a tight , smooth topknoton her head . Her pale cheeks were polished like wax , polished by cleanliness , physical , spiritual ; and by the light of devotion to principle that no word or act could dim , byp174faith in an acceptance of God that was pure as a nun 's ( a Protestant , puritan God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there in the iridescence of her eyes , and in the gold cross on the chain around her neck . The dust-colored wool of her skirt fell , heavy and full , in open pleats , below her ankles , and the stiffened bodice was laced by a velvet ribbon high beneath her breasts . " The wife , she and the children saw the pig on Wednesdaynight , " Knau said . He took a handful of poppy-seed pods from his trouser pocket , and he split one pod with the black nail of his thumb . As he spoke , he offered the seeds to them in the hollow of his palm . " A ewe lamb strayed off a week ago , and after supper now in the evening , the wife takes the children and walks down to the stream . She thinks the ewe lamb might come back at sundown to drink , " he said . With the stiff hat fixed immovable on his brow , he shook his head at this simplicity . " On Wednesday , there was the boar standing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stream , close enough to have killed the lot of them ! " " His eyes were red , like coals , " his wife said quietly . With one open hand , she smoothed the darkly flowered apron at her waist . " What in God 's name are they talking about ? " the Colonelasked , but genially , patiently , determined to keep it well in hand as he looked from one to the other in the sun . And now a tall boy stood behind the woman at the door ; a boy in outgrown corduroys standing with his small head drooping forward on his strong , narrow neck , and his wrists hanging long and bony from his sleeves , flesh and bone of both of them , but already taller than either one . In his dreaming face , it was the mother 's wide , grey eyes that observedthe hunters , but from under Knau 's black , glossy brows . His neck and hands were weathered like the man 's , but his lips were delicate and the palest coral , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white flecks at the temples such as touched the mother 's hair . As she and the boy left the wooden step , the younger children watched covertly through the curtain 's mesh , watched the tiny , weightless woman who now followed them , no larger than a child herself , but she and the mother dressed identically , except for the Oma 's white coif on her head . The women moved to a bench below the kitchen windows in the sun , and rolled their heavy sleeves back on their forearms , their motions , too , identical . The boy , in strange variance with the gentle look of the prophet in his face , crossed the cobbles to brood in wonder at the guns lying on the station-wagon floor . " Walter , here , he saw the jeep both nights with me , " Knau said , the poppy seeds between his teeth . " We went after it together , carrying sticks . Two of us on foot , and without guns ! We might as well have been trying to catch witches ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . " Let 's get along to the area at once , " said the Colonel briskly . His patience was raveling out . With a gesture of his hand , he disposed of the hogs , the geese , the hens , the cattle , dismissing the sound of Knau 's complaining of he knew not what , and the sight of the women with their bright , quick knives peeling the clean potato skins away . All this was background scenery , like the funeral pyre of manure intricately laced with smooth filaments of straw that had been dyed by urine to the purest gold . " Lock up the car , Stephany , so they ca n't get at the ammunition , " he said , jerking his chin toward the tall boy . There was a reckless note in his voice now , perhaps the sound of his willful abandonmentto circumstance , as if the adventure that lay before them was as pleasurably hazardous as war . " Come , Milly ! " he called . " You and Stephany fall in together ! " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruddy flesh packedp176firmly in his khaki , a paratrooper 's silken scarf , mottled olive and sand in camouflage , knotted at his throat . And Knau , his back and shoulders as stiff as wood in the old , ceremonial black of baptisms , weddings , burials , kept pace beside him . The dachshund 's short , bowed legs were hung with champagne-coloredhair , and a flexible , twisting part ran the length of her spine , with the hair falling in two ways from it , as she followed in obedience at Knau 's heels . Here and there , a chicken that had bedded down in the dust between the cobbles fluttered up in panic , and fled with its quick , rolling , yellow-footed gait from the sound of their boots ringing out on the stone . From one courtyard they passed came , hissing aloud , a string of geese as white as swans , and their necks as long , but their vicious acceptance of the limits set by gutter and dung , and their gaudy , clown-like feet , took any title to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast aside as irrelevant to this totally male safari , the girl had never been discarded . She was there , bare-headed , bare-legged , in her green dress , neitherhunter nor hunted , so self-effaced that each could endowher with his own choice of identity . Her presence gave a liveliness to the Colonel 's step , and a knightly gallantry to this role of defender of the villagers which he had chosen to play . She walked docilely beside Stephany , her russet head lowered , a reluctant bride , thought Jaeger , approaching the altar beside a bridegroom whose flesh she can not bear . ( But what bride , what bride ? he asked himself , walking behind them . The name he wanted for her seemed on the tip of his tongue . " On earth I was a Virgin Sister , " he remembered a fragment of the poem ; " . . . and this which seems so low a post was given to me because the vows I took were broken , or rather complete observance was lost . . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flower whose name he could not remember , that delicate spirit whom Dante had asked aboutp177in Purgatory as he passed through  --  asked about as casually and colloquially as a man might ask at the corner drugstore about a girl he had taken to the movies one summer night  --  and whose face Dante had recognized among the ghostly ones that pressed about him in the Heaven of the Moon . And then Jaeger found it . " Piccarda , Piccarda ! " he had to keep himself from crying out , and he saw the girl who walked before him as lost , as damned , as violated , as the thirteenth-century Piccarda , with no one to stand between her and the purgatory or inferno that lay ahead . ) " I was thinking of Dante in the Paradiso , " Jaeger said , his voice lowered so that Honerkamp , walking beside him , cupped one hand around an ear . " Even the infantry , even marching in formation , " Honerkampsaid , " can retain for a little longer the right to think . But not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should think  --  as the threshold of the next war ! " With his eyes on Milly and Stephany , he went on saying that he did n't like the Colonel 's military strategy . " I do n't approve of his deploymentof his men , " he said . Jaeger wanted to speak to him of Piccarda Donati , who had dedicated herself to silence like the girl who walked before them in a dress the color of fern frond , of inchworm , of Paradiso ( for now the Florentine Beatrice and Catherine Roberts , like Milly and Piccarda , had become interchangeable to him , and he and Dante were abruptly one . He saw himself condemned to live , as Dante had lived , with no knowledge of the loved one 's flesh . Ach , Gott , must I make literary personages of the bone and blood of these women ? he cried to himself . Let me get them , Beatrice , Catherine , out of the pages of a book , and hold them hard against me , like a man ! ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Already , the first time we met , she made a choice . But now , perhaps tonight , she will have to act on it , for the Colonel is asking for action from us all . Itp178may be as close as that , the showdown . It 's so present that I can taste it , smell it , on the air . " The village street was like the trough of a dry stream 's rocky bed , and it now turned abruptly steep under their feet . In the spring , thought Jaeger , it must be transformed to a muddy , roaring torrent from the rains cascading down . Even in desiccation , it had the drained look of a cobbled moat , and the last bend of it brought them past the blacksmith 's forge . In the dark gap of his barn door , the forging-iron burned , white-hot and visible in its own right beyond the threshold where the outside heat and sunlight ceased . A speckled grey horse was tied to a ring in the door 's weathered frame , his loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fright as the smith cradled his hoof in the leather apron spread across his knees . Two by two , the Colonel'sentourage passed by , the elite in olive drab , and the others following in humbler dress , leaving the village behind and taking the footpath out through pasture and cultivated fields . Here the land advanced blade by incredibly green blade of rye , by small , hard , white shoulder after shoulder of winter beet under separate canopies of blistered leaves , proceeded stalk by stalk of moon-petaled poppy , and the bleached embroidery of Queen Anne 's lace , to the far edge of the forest , shadowed already by the secrecy and murder of the night . Now Knau stopped short . " The big pig came down this far last Wednesday night ! " he shouted back at Jaeger . " Mittwoch Abend ! " he roared , and the dachshund called Hexe listened sharply to him . Her ears hung in long auburn locks on each side of her sunken face , and the pointed wafer of her tongue showed in her mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would , in her eager courage , have sought out the wild boar now and driven itp179from ambush for his delight . " Right here , he stood ! " Knau shouted to Jaeger . " The wife and children had to run for their lives back to the house ! " " Before dark , we 'll leave a man here where the footbridge crosses the stream , " said the Colonel . " Seth , that will be you . You 'll get here on foot . The rest of us will drive out the lumber road . And there , out there , where the path joins the road , " he said , his arm pointing the way , " we 'll drop Stephany off . We 'll go on as far as we can by car . You 're to keep out of sight , Seth , and keep upwind . Your job is to let Stephany know if anything 's coming his way . If you hear the jeep coming out from the village along the road , double-quick it ahead , and close in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you  --  at the tires as it goes by . " The world was so armored with brilliance that the blacknessand contraband of the coming night had little meaning . The time for its peril to move out of the forest and across the shining fields seemed a hundred years away . Yet Honerkampmust have glimpsed some sight or smell of it as he stood , halted , his fingers combing quickly through his curly hair . " I think I can cope with the jeep , sir , " he said . They were standing closer together now , so there was no need for him to raise his voice . " Man and his possibilities are my terrain , I suppose . But a better hunter than I am will have to brief me on the boar . " " Just shoot for the heart , " said Stephany . He raised both arms , as if handling a gun , and mockingly took aim , and closed one eye . " That 's all . As if you were courting a woman , " the Colonelsaid ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how . " " Aim for the heart in total darkness ? " Honerkamp said.  | " You wo n't have any trouble . Their eyes are luminous , " Stephany said . He rubbed the back of his forefinger under the clean hairs of his mustache , effacing the smile . " Jaeger , you 'll circle the woods on the left flank , " the Colonel said . " Knau and I will keep circling to the right . We 'll have five guns among us , provided Milly wants to carry one . " " Five , " the girl said , speaking for the first time now . It might have been a question that she asked . " Jaeger is n't a forester , and he does n't happen to be an American . If you 're going to have regulations , then they 're to be respected even with no one looking on . At least , if I 'm around , they are , " the Colonel said . " Milly , you 're under orders , too , tonight . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll stay with Stephany . " " Yes , " the girl whispered . Her head was lowered . " Yes . But I 'll go without a gun . " " It 's the size of this boar that I 'm concerned about , " Honerkamp said . He went on talking quickly , eagerly , as if the Colonel 's words had not struck his heart their separate blows . " Hylocherus meinertzhageni , they say , is the largest known , measuring six feet , and found only in the densest forests . But , according to legend , there was a boar hunted by King Arthur that measured sixteen feet , and that had blue-black bristles , like stunted pine trees , down its spine , and the foam on its mouth when it was ready to attack , the books say , was like the spume of a mighty waterfall . " " The German variety 's slightly smaller , " Stephany said , keeping the sound of laughter back . " Ask Knau about the size of this local pig , " the Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impatient with the German words . " Well , what does he have to say ? " " He says about the size of a large dog , " Jaeger translated.  | " Thank God , my wife is n't here ! " the Colonel exploded with a show of joviality . " If she heard that , she 'd come right back from Paris and take it home as a pet ! She 's always befriending the outcasts , the lame ducks , the maladjusted . That 's why I gave her a week 's leave , " he said . His blue eye was colder than metal as he looked at Jaeger . " I would say this particular boar was maladjusted , would n't you , Jaeger ? I would say he was introverted  --  you know , unable to mix with his own kind . Ask the forester 's opinion on that sometime , " he said , his shoulders tossing , and now he set off again with Knau beside him , keeping the lead . And this time Honerkamp got out of line and caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recipe for stuffed boar 's head , " he began saying to the right side of her face . On her left walked Stephany , and she looked at neither of them , but walked as if alone . " First , you take the skin of the head off care-fully  --  " " Let 's skip that phase of the operation , " Jaeger heard Stephany say ; and Honerkamp went on : "  --  and then a mixture of minced pig 's liver , chopped applesand onion , rosemary and sage , is molded into the empty hood , restoring the boar 's head to its normal shape . Then a second stuffing is placed inside the first , consisting of sausage meat , ox tongue , truffles , mushrooms , nuts and apples , the lot of it saturated with Calvados . And once you 've got the head packed solid , you wrap it up in a linen cloth , sew it in  --  " " That would be a shroud , " Jaeger , walking alone , heard Stephany say. "  --  and you place it in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for  --  good God , I 'm hungry ! " Honerkamp broke off , and the Colonel turned quickly on his heel . " Seth , keep in formation ! " he called back across the lightof noon , his voice still equable , but the blood igniting slowly in his jowls . So Honerkamp walked with Jaeger again , and as they came to the lumber road , Knau could be heard speaking of foxes , shouting the words out louder and louder , as if the sheer volume of his voice must crack at last the Colonel 's resistance to what was being said . Knau was saying there was a fox burrow that ran in and out of and under the rocks on the first slope behind the clump of oak trees just around the turn . They would be in sight of it at once , he said , his arms threshing like a windmill 's in the direction where it lay . The foxes , the foxes , he shouted , as if in argument with the Colonel , and Hexe lifted her silky , auburn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen fox cubs who played there in the early morning and early evening , said Knau , and he wanted to wipe the marauders out . " What seems to be on his mind ? " The Colonel had turned again , and he called the questions back to Jaeger . " ' What 's he trying to get at ? " he said . But once they had passed the compact island of trees , even the Colonel could see . For now it was Knau 's campaignthat was getting under way , and it was he who designatedthe positions to be held . A man must stand in readiness at each of the far-flung exits , while he took for his own the main door hollowed in the tangled roots of the oak trees . The sun poured over the stones and the scorched earth of the foxes ' burrow , but halted abruptly at the dark line of the forest 's midday shade . Within that shade , among the lacquered leaves and fern and the rot of fallen branch and bark , Jaeger saw what he took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers . But it was not flowers , and what had seemed a wreath was the circular stampede of death as fox teeth tore the white plumage in frenzy from a still wildly fighting chicken 's flesh.  | " Get them hard on the back of the neck as they run out , " Knau was directing them , his eyes stubborn and black under his hat brim and his brows . In the absence of firearms , each man was equipped with a branch wrenched from the forest 's intricately laid floor , and they moved to their positions , testingthese in their hands . But to the girl and the Colonel , Knau gave no orders . They stood apart in the dappled sunshineby the clump of trees . " I 've counted six of them , six young , mornings and evenings when I pass . If the old ones are out in the woods , we 'll have no trouble with the cubs , " Knau said . Now the men were ready , and Knau spoke the single word to Hexe , and she went flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips half smiling , the champagne-colored silk of her tail visible an instant , as she entered the sloping tunnel of the fox 's hole . The threshold of the hole Jaeger guarded might well have been the playground of the cubs , for the earth before the opening was strewn with small , brittlebones , some leg , some rib , and with the tiny , desiccated hoofs of fawns , of lambs , and even the fan-like frame of a stripped wing , like the paraphernalia of games discarded at the sight of something marvelously new . Stephany 's exit was to the right , and he , too , stood poised , the handsome , unresolvedface above the olive of the army shirt now flushed and set with the heat of his intent . On the left , Honerkamphad something else on his mind , for his head was thrown back , and his eyes were squinting at the sky above his head . Although Jaeger stood weighing the club in his two hands , he knew that the day was too clear , too bright , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jaeger , " Honerkamp called suddenly , " I 've just worked something out . Once , just before dawn , I flew up this valley , and , damn it , I can hear the steel hearts of the bombers now . This morning , today , as we drove out , there was a roadp184sign outside Ober-Pastau saying Kastel is a hundred kilometersto the north , and I knew it must have been these hills I crossed . Kastel , " he said . " You may have been there since . We brought such annihilation on that one town that they tell me what 's left of it even now bears no more relation to reality than the hushed , volcanic twilight of Pompeii . We hit all targets . Nothing was taboo , " Honerkamp said , still looking at the high , luminous sky . " Sometimes I persuade myself that Kastel can be dismissed now , written off , as classical ruins have been written off in silence  --  those ruins produced by act of God and not by man , and somehowsalvaged by their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not like Niederstadt .

" " The opera house , " Jaeger said , not loud . The opera house . And this man , close as a brother , had his part in it . " One night in April , the music stopped playing , and the singers no longer sang , " Honerkamp said . " I had done my bit .... " And now the muffled yapping of the dachshund sounded in the labyrinth of tunnels , the frantic , strident cry of her pursuing sounding underground , now near , now far . " Get ready for action , boys ! " the Colonel cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screaming earth beneath their feet into the bodies of the waiting men . " Get ready , boys ! " the Colonel called , his voice strangely choked with his delight . At once , a wild , blind passion ran headlong in their veins . Hot and panting , it ran , like rabid dog or fox ,  |p185and  no way out for it , no exit , no escape , unless they raised their clubs and struck . Ah , but I wo n't , I wo n't ! Jaeger told himself , but he was trembling in the sun . Ah , but you 'll see , I wo n't ! he said with a craftiness designed to outwit at the final moment the hot , bright , violent desire to strike down all that ran and shrieked and bared sharp , vicious teeth at death , to deal blow after frenzied blow on all that snarled and spun and clawed at life , to strike over and over , endlessly , until the lust was drained out of his veins . " They 're going your way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coarsened , heavy look hung on Stephany 's mouth because of the fury of this thing he was prepared to do . But the outcry of the chase swerved right , then left , and for an instant it seemed that the pursued turned on the pursuer , for the dog 's voice no longer yapped , but fought savagely for life . At what moment the girl had turned from the sound of it and walked away , Jaeger did not know . For a time , she was there by the oak trees , and then she was gone , already quite far , her back turned to them , going alone in her green dress through the varying greens of the countryside , followingback the lumber road . In the foxes ' tunnels , the pack ran screaming still , and because of the fire in the Colonel 's blood , he did not seem to know that she had gone . She walked steadily away , walking , it might be over and through this country and into another , not looking back , or looking across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lumber road until it turned into the village street and then into the highway , walking until it crossed the frontier betweenthis country and the next , between Germany and France , by some bridge across a river , or some quiet wood where gravestones stretched endlessly , not stopping at the customs because she did n't have any baggage with her , having nothing but absolute silence to declare . She would walk through France , bypassing the towns , walking onp186through fields and brush as she walked now , because one got to Paris quicker like this , the way a crow or a carrier pigeon flies . The sun struck brightly on the crown of her head , so after a while only the russet of her hair could be seen glowing against the separate greens as she went on , walking through the Porte d'Orleans , crossing the Champde-Marsand the Seine to the Champs-Elysees , walking up under the marroniers to where her mother might be sitting on a cafe terrace , walking in absolute silence , slender , erect , out of the territory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jaeger wanted to call out after her . You ca n't go without him , you ca n't leave him here without  --  withoutwhat ? He paused a moment . She was growing smaller and smaller , green against the varying green , even the shiningrusset fading now . Without love ! he wanted to shout before she had gone beyond recall . " They 're bearing your way , Seth ! " the Colonel was crying out . But Honerkamp suddenly flung his stick behind him into the underbrush . " What in God 's name are you doing ? The foxes , damn it , the foxes ! " the Colonel cried . Honerkamp looked at each of the men , his face closed tight as a fist against them , and then he began to run , his tweed jacket flying open , his grey flannel trousers flapping above his tennis shoes , running swiftly and lightly , for all his weight , down the slope to the road , jumping sideways over rocks and roots , after the small , far figure of the girl . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unguarded hole . From it , the tumult of yapping now issued , high and clear . He fell on his knees before it , gropingfrantically in the underbrush at the forest 's edge for the discarded club , the stick , the bough , any bough , any branch , any stone , that might serve as weapon to clobber the fury in his blood ; and louder , sharper , wilder , racing closer to thep187surface , came the snapping and snarling of the foxes and the dachshund 's piercing cry . " Stop them , stop them ! " the Colonel roared . The whites of his eyes were shot with blood , and the irises blazing with blue fire . " Get over here , Stephany ! Get a stick for me , Jaeger ! " he pled . " For Christ 's sake , Jaeger , get me a  --  " Empty-handed , he reeled to his feet , his fingers working , reaching , as if he would strangle the life from the foxes as they came . And , one by one , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , six separate flashes of red , with Hexe close on the brush of the last one , but not close enough to seize it in her foam-flecked jaws . Off into the woods the lot of them went , the sound of the chase heard a little longer , but fading , and then the dark door of the forest was closed on the clamor of their flight . For a moment , the dachshund 's voice soared in one faint , distant note , almost musical , and now strangely touched with sorrow . She had given her bright , unquestioning courage to this that man had asked of her , and if she had failed it was becauseman , too , had failed . When she returned , she walked in shame , her eyes lowered , her tail dragging in the leaves . Jaeger had wanted to laugh uproariously in the instant the foxes flashed through the Colonel 's legs , but now in the silence of his defeat there was no humor in it . Everythinghad escaped the Colonel 's grasp  --  at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only the meaning of boar and jeep , and silence and speech , but the ebonynosed , murderous little foxes had now eluded him , gone as artfully and irretrievably as his wife and daughter , leavinghim standing baffled here.  |p188In  the middle of the afternoon , they sat down at the round table in the forester 's kitchen , Milly and Honerkamp side by side on a bench set against the paneling of the wall , and Knau on Honerkamp 's left hand , his back and shoulders rigid , his square face as inflexible as wood under the black hat 's rigid brim . Then came the Oma ( her white coif no larger than a paper drinking-cup , and she no larger than the child beside her , but a figure of unassailable dignity because of the carriageof her head and the history of consecration to God and man that was written on her brow ) . Next came Frau Knau , with the blond children seated low on stools on either side of her , their eyes just visible above the tablecloth . The Colonel , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed the circle , the boy last , sitting at Milly 's right hand . The Colonel opened the neat cartons of sandwicheshis cook had prepared , laid the waxed paper back , and distributed hard-boiled eggs and paper napkins , the good officer , the official provider , the situation well in hand again , sacrificing nothing of rank or discipline , but sharing the available rations and quarters with his men . He had nothing at all to say to Honerkamp , and no glance to give in his direction . In betraying men who hunted , it might be that Honerkamp had betrayed country and countrymen as well ; and the girl could have been dead and in her grave for all the attention the Colonel paid to her . A great wheel of brown bread had been placed in the center of the table , one of twenty Frau Knau had baked in the village oven at the end of the street . They had seen thep189others , stacked on shelves and covered with unbleached muslin , in the damp of the woodshed behind the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vest now and cut thick slabs of it , and offered each slab on the point of the knife , to the women last , once the children had been served , but offering it first to the men . And Jaeger ate hungrily , spreading sweet country butter on the bread , and drank the good coffee that Frau Knau had poured into their cups , aware that this wealth of food belonged only to the peasant , and to the Occupier of his soil . The rest of the country queued up on shoe-leather worn thin , in clothes gone threadbare a long time back , and paid their coins out carefully , one by one , on the counters of the stores . He thought he had never tasted butter as good as this , and the sugar in the flowered china basin was Jack Frost sugar , the very finest , poured from the American five-pound blue bag of it that Frau Knau kept with the other bags , and the tins of coffee and cocoa , out of sight of the curious in the cupboardunderneath the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandwiches , the prophylactically bleached slices , cut in America before traveling overseas , and spread now with potted ham and chicken , with synthetic liver-paste , with processed cheese , no tastier than wax , with cream cheese studded with olive and pimento , all from the groaning shelves of the American Commissary that stood under Fahrbach 's horsechestnuttrees , to which no German had access unless he served behind the counters there . Only the girl did not eat ; she took the half-moon of a bite from the corner of one sandwich and then laid it on the cloth , waiting , it might be , for the moment when she could put a cigarette in her mouth , or hold a drink in her hand , seemingly benumbed , almost effaced , knowing some inviolable pattern would bep190broken if she did either here . She sat , her still face masking whatever furious demands clamored within , watching the blond children across the cloth . " Here you are , kiddies-o . Here 's something you 'll like , " the Colonel was saying in a loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their stools at the sight of the bananas he now brought out . " We did n't have bananas during the war , " Knau said , the inflexibility giving a little . He picked one up in his blackrimmedfingers and drew the yellow skin back to show the children how it was done . " Maybe they wo n't like the taste , " the girl said scarcely above a whisper . And they did not like it . They drew the backs of their hands across their mouths and turned their faces aside . It was the Oma , her lips working fast as a monkey 's , who ate the waxy pieces that they left beside their plates . But however the military ostracized him , still Honerkamp would have his say about music , and he leaned one arm in the tweed jacket on the table and talked his reckless Germaneagerly to Knau . While he talked , he ate rapidly , furiously , saying , chewing , that to replace the military traditionin this country , the tradition of music , German music , must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the polyphony , say , of Mozart , he said , rejected even for one Austrian who died too young , and the figures who stood massive and immobile in German history must no longer be Frederick the Great , or Bluecher , or Moltke , or Bismarck , no longer Ludendorff , or Hindenburg , or whatever others there were who stamped out the measure of the booted , belted , homicidal dance . But , crowdingthe national stage until they became the corporeity of man 's belief , should be Bach , Handel , Haydn , Beethoven , Schubert , right up to Orff , and not stop there.  | " I see them , and all the others , poets , musicians , I have n't named , " he said , or he was trying to say , having trouble with the tenses of the verbs ; " I see them with hands reaching out to touch the hands of other poets , composers , reaching out of the past , through the critical interval of the present , into the indefinite spaces of time ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not any kind of shackles , but a living chain to which free men can cling for life  --  and not one single poet , not one musician , is to be discarded or overlooked , none , for the chain must stretch unbroken , link by link , from time long past to time immeasurable ahead , if Germany is to fulfill her destiny . They are to be cherished , these poor , longing men , in the same proportion and with the same national devotionwith which every military figure has been cherished until now . They are all to be revered , and when this has been understood , then every military figure will be rejected as unworthy to speak and act in the name of the true dignity of man . " He paused a moment , his features tense and small , chewing fiercely at the bite of brown bread in his mouth . " The hands of the musicians , the poets , " he went on finally , " the hands of these men who attest to the only absolute truth we know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one century into the next , from death through life , stretching into the only kind of afterlife of which we can be certain . You see that , do n't you ? You understand that , do n't you , Herr Knau ? " he said . " Ja , ja , " said the forester . " Ja , ja , " and gravely , wisely , he nodded his head . But in his eagerness , Honerkamp could not say it all as he wished in German , and he turned suddenly to English , askingJaeger to put it into better German than he was able to for Knau . " At the America House I 'm setting up courses that I think would interest you , Herr Knau , to come into in thep192winter when the farm work slackens off . " He reached for a sandwich now , raised one corner of it with an expert finger to see what lay within , and then folded it into his mouth . As he chewed , he listened to Jaeger putting the words into German for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the recognition of the creative identity , " he said , and Knau listened to the sound of it translated to him , and gravely blinked his eyes , and gravely , gravely , nodded . " I want to undertake some sort of study of the Befindlichkeiten of man , of musical man , as a beginning , " Honerkamp said , and the Colonel and Stephany looked across the table at him with jaundiced eyes . " Now that armed conflict is done with for the moment , another kind of conflict has got under way . And this time it 's going to be a battle to the death , and not only here in Germany , but all over Europe , the Far East , right across your world and mine , Herr Knau . " Honerkamp'sfeatures were gathered close and small to a focal point in the center of his face , fixed there by the fury of his chewing and his speech . " We 've got to take part in the survival , whether it be as civilian or military man ; the potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defender of national boundaries . That is the choice , " he said . " Ja , ja , said Knau ; " wahrlich , wahrlich , " his eyes bleak with bewilderment as he got up from the table . " Ja , ja , " he said , and he walked to the cup closet by the stove and took the bottle down . He bore it back to the table , his fingers fast around the neck of it , as if it was a living thing . In the other hand he carried five squat , greenish-colored glasses , their thick bottoms nestling in his palm . Honerkamp 's voice ceased as the forester stood looking at the faces of the men . " Would they like a little drink of Schnapps ? " Knau said to Jaeger , and he set the glasses down before them : one for the Colonel , one for Lieutenant Stephany , one for Honerkamp , one for Jaeger , and the fifth at his own empty place.  |p193They  watched in silence as he poured the liquor slowly out , filling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there might be no more than the promise of one burning swallow in each glass , still the presence of drink was like dispensation given , and the Colonel looked quickly at the girl . Then he pushed his untouched glass toward her across the cloth . " Let 's have one more here , " he said to Jaeger . " So the daughter drinks Schnapps , too ! " Knau said , and he gave a laugh . The women watched her , their eyes clear and uncondemning , not judging her for this any more than for the red on her mouth or the indecency of her naked arms and legs , observing without astonishment or censure that this was the way things went in another country , that this was American , acknowledged like the powdered substance in glass jars that turned to coffee at the touch of water , and was called , for no good reason , by an American general 's name . Now that life had taken on another look , the Colonel was smiling at Milly , and he lifted his brimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your mother 's trip to Paris ! " he said . The fires of warmth , of conviviality , were lighted in their blood again , and all that had taken place in the morning , all that was to transpire after evening fell , was bearable now , was funny , almost . A different light had been shed on everything . " Here , fill them up again , " the Colonel said cheerfully . " Now that you 've brought the issue of civilian and soldier up , " he said , his good humor embracing Honerkamp as well , " I 'd like to point out that , provided , of course , I have any say in the matter at all , I 'd prefer my daughter to marry an army man . Selfish , you think ? Well , perhaps it is . He 'd have to take orders from me , all right . " He looked around the table , and jerked his shoulders , and laughed . " Why not ? Doesn'tp194experience count for anything ? Are n't the benefits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  let 's say the experience of dealing with all kinds of men  --  is n't that good enough to earn a son-in-law 's respect ? " The girl was smiling , too , looking straight into her glass . " I think it will shock you terribly when I marry , " she said in a low voice . " Shock me ? " the Colonel cried out , his eyes quite startled . " Here , Jaeger , have Knau pour us a little more . " He pushed the drained glass forward with his fingertips . " Yes , terribly , terribly , " the girl said . She watched the liquor slowly filling their glasses again . " Because I will marry someone you would consider inferior . You know , " she said scarcely aloud , but smiling still , " the way you considerme inferior . " " Consider you  --  ? Consider what ? " the Colonel cried out . " You , inferior ? My God , what 's the matter with you , Milly ? " His hand pulled at the scarf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it were its mottled silk that choked him now . " But , yes , you do , " the girl said , her voice quiet , but her hand trembling a little as she lifted the glass and took anotherswallow of the Schnapps . " If I married an army man , then I would take on some kind of standing  --  you know what I mean . There would be rules to obey , and things like that , and you think that would raise me to a sort of standard . I mean , officially . But I 'm going to marry somebody quite different from an army man . I know exactly who I 'm going to marry , " she said , looking down into the little glass . " Oh , you do ? " said the Colonel . " So you know who you 're going to marry ? " His voice was dull now , and he spoke slowly , the fire in his blood extinguished . There seemed no anger left in him as his eyes moved to Honerkampin awful recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I suppose you could even tell me his name , and the date that you 've fixed for the ceremony , " he said , looking dully at the girl . " This is extremely interesting . I suppose your mother knows all about it . I suppose she 's gone to Paris to pick out the trousseau , " he said . But now Stephany came abruptly to life at the table . Under the smooth , glossy line of his mustache , his teeth seemed extravagantly white , his closely shaven jaws , the olive of his shirt , the cloth of his battle jacket , extravagantly clean in the glare of the indoor sun . The Colonel 's bereft eyes were turned to him , given respite for a brief moment by a look of hope , for Stephany , his hand playing with the fork beside his plate , had begun to speak with a new power and authority . " Are n't there established rules for any well-regulated game or life ? " he said . His handsome , well-groomed head was cocked sideways at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how you reacted to rational decision , and I would have said that it was a feminine and irrational reaction , except that Honerkamp took your part . Here you have poachers  --  I'mspeaking of the foxes  --  and you ca n't face up to the logical disposal of them . In failing to do that , it seems to me that you and Honerkamp are putting yourselves on the side of the men who drive out here and machine-gun the deer . " His hand played indolently with the fork still , and his mouth was quizzical under the line of his mustache . " Do you think we 're all entitled to make our own personal rules as to procedures ? " he asked , leaning back in a leisurely , almost arrogant , way in the hard , wooden chair . The Colonel had seemed to close his ears to the sound of it , and he watched him with drained eyes . " For instance  --  to give you an extremesupposition , " Stephany said , " do you think any army would have the right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beard  --  "  | " Yes , " the girl said , not looking up , her voice not loud . " Yes . Armies have done that , and sometimes they won . " " They won because they had n't shaved ? " said Stephany , the smile pulling at his soft , twitching mouth . " Well , of course , you may be perfectly right . But I think you should give us names and dates , then . I think Colonel Roberts would agree with me on this . I think you would , sir , " he said , turning his head in deference to the Colonel now . His fingers ceased playing with the fork , and he reached absentlyfor the half-empty glass before him , and , scarcely seeming to see it , drank the hot liquid down . " I know the Colonel has confidence in a system that tests a man 's qualityby his endurance , as we do in the field , for instance , by taking a team of four men , and putting each member under a thirty-pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men going over rough terrain on an average of forty miles a day . I think  --  I feel pretty certain  --  that you would agree with me , sir , that officer material , and I say quite frankly that I do n't think there is any better material  --  " " All right , " said the Colonel testily . " All right , Stephany , let 's forget it now . " This was never the love song that would woo her . This was never the music that she would want to hear . " I believe it when you do n't say it , if that makes any sense to you , " he said . He looked at Jaeger . " Tell Knau to open another bottle , " he said . " Now this morning , out in the field , Honerkamp , " Stephanysaid , keeping the offensive still , " you spoke of taking aim in the dark , and I think the information we have on that would interest you . Only in the training of the military man , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of muscle and eye co-ordination that makes it possible for the welltrainedsoldier to get his target three times out of four in total darkness at a range of fifty yards . " " My God , Stephany , " said the Colonel , " I did n't knowp197you would be going intellectual on us , too ! Let 's drink up and get out in the field and see some action for ourselves , " he said . ( At this moment , Jaeger 's mind , or perhaps merely the cranium that housed it , became a square room , bare of furnishings , lit by the single hot bulb of the Schnapps he had drunk down . In this uncluttered space , Jaeger saw severalStephanys ; saw him as child , black-eyed , black-haired , . white-skinned , emasculated by all that swaggered in him in uncertainty ; saw him as cub scout , boy scout , the uniform always fitting well , the oath of allegiance given , even if only to himself , with photogenic gravity ; saw him beloved of family , but always , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draught of the love borne him , always a stale crumb of betrayal in the fresh leaven of the bread of every day ; saw him fearful and alone because not valued by peers or teachers , never cherished as friend , and yet almost getting by because he could counterfeit all parts for short duration ; driving the family car , recklessly , heedlessly , at fourteen , belovedfor brief weeks by the wrong girls , irresolute , not quite reliable in any place , at any time , in any role , the scarcely audible sighs for what he failed to be misting the brightness of the committed hearts ; saw him , ever since boy-scout days , wanting to make it with someone others coveted , someone with a name in movies or on the stage , trusting no choice , no decision , unless it had been popularly confirmed . There he stood in the clinical light of Jaeger 's square room , with nothing but vanity to cover his stripped , quaking bones . He had ' been summoned out of the darkness of one night in the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to shoot a fellow officer  --  both of them roaring , blind , fit for the guardhouse , the story went at the Fahrbach Presse , but spared because of rank  --  and now he faced in Jaeger 's cranium the poor truth that , even unconscious , it must neverp198be your own kind that you betray . He had tried to shoot a fellow officer outside the Officers ' Club , for the sake of a German waitress smelling of American detergent and GermanKraut , whose bed he had shared the night before and wanted to share again . It was the Colonel who had shouted " Hush " louder even than the shots Stephany had fired , a " Hush " so loud that the M.P.s were n't certain they had heard the shooting down the hill ; and the Colonel it was who silenced the accusations of the other officer beforeseeing him transferred to Austria , leaving only the screams of the German girl to ring uncomforted across that April night . This the Colonel had done in brusque indulgenceof Stephany , having marked him , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his handful of clay , to be molded , punished , dressed , and decorated , year by year , not only into the figure of a son-in-law shaped by his will , but as well into a figure of a man . But always there was a sense of loss , a missing dimension , always the knowledge that he would not quite do , weighing on the longing , loving , sighing hearts that would enfold this Stephany . However he moved in Jaeger 's bare , square room , and smiled under his mustache , however he pled that he needed the Colonel 's daughter to salvage his future and his pride , still he had the grace to turn his face away a little so that no one need feel the obligation of looking into his eyes . ) Before they had sat down to eat , Honerkamp must have gone from top to bottom of the house , for he had seen the miniature organ closed in the parlor , and it was this he spoke of now . Knau told him it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church , and who played the familyorgan here . And after a while , Honerkamp had it out of them that music had given their courtship its flavor and shape . Knau had his viola in the attic still , and Frau Knau had sung , as a girl , in the church choir.  | " But now I am too old . I have too many duties , " she said , and the color rose in her smooth cheeks as high as the halfmoonsof shadow under her eyes . " She 's out picking potatoes instead of practicing her hymns ! " Knau said , and he laughed . But his eyes were soft and warm as he looked at his wife , and he pushed his hat off his brow for a moment with the back of his hand . It was to Honerkamp they spoke , offering the memories of what they had once been to him alone . In the end , Knau rose from the table and crossed the hall , and opened the door of the parlor , and beckoned to them to come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and air of everyday , and this was an honor he conferred now , ushering them a day before the Sabbath into the hush of the apple-scented room . " We have n't much time to spare , " the Colonel said in a whisper . " You 're right , sir ; we have n't , " said Stephany . He looked at the time on his wrist . But now Knau had brought his viola down , and he wiped the dust from the worn brown leather of its case , and he took it out , and laid it on the folded handkerchief under his chin . While his forefinger plucked at the catgut strings , and his dark ear listened for the " a , " the " g , " the " e , " the boy sat down before the organ and spread his fingers on the keys . The others , civilian and military alike , were crowded behind them , the Colonel and Stephany near the door , their arms crossed over on their breasts , breathing uneasily the odor of sanctity that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasp and wheeze of the organ began , Honerkamp opened the pages of the hymnal that had stood on the music rack , and the boy closed his eyes , and raised his face in humility as if to receive the benediction of some mystic light . But to Jaeger , the Colonel 's and Stephany 's distaste for Honerkampp200seemed stronger than faith and louder than the music of voice and instrument that began to fill this dedicated shrine . " Ein ' feste Burg ist under Gott ! " sang Honerkamp , and , beside him , Frau Knau sang too , her Ingres-like hands clasped on her apron , her rounded , golden throat filled with a smooth column of sound . " Ein ' gute Wehr and Wa f-f en ! " they sang . The righteous , Protestant words of Luther thundered now against the ceiling of the little room , while the music of organ and viola cried yea , and yea , and yea . The boy 's fingers pressed the keys , tenderly , urgently , pressingand pressing a fervent music from the organ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but never quite expired . " Er steht uns bei in aller Not ! " the voices declared in approbation of all that was finite and absolute , all that was uncorrupted , all that was as cold and unforgiving as stone . Knau sawed the flat of his bow from end to end across the strings , his shoulders square , his arm beneath the instrumentunshaken , his black-rimmed fingers closing like traps on each separate note and holding the handful of them fast . On one side of Jaeger stood the girl , humming under her breath , and , on the other , the Oma , her hands folded on the dusty pleatings of her skirt , her foot tapping steadily , her voice keening perilously high . " Wir treten zum Beten vor Gott den Gerechten ! " the organ pipes trebled , and the voices rose in celebration ; and so illumined was the boy 's raised face that he seemed to be seated below an altar , with the refulgence of **26;2159;TOOLONG windows shining down upon his brow . " 0 Herr , steh uns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Oma keened on her single note , mourningbecause of the potatoes still unpeeled , the socks still not darned , the new cabbage not brought in from the fields , the dishes not done , the fire , it might be , dying inp201the kitchen stove ; improvident , improvident , this lost half-day that was not the Sabbath , and the vegetables for the evening soup still in the soil . Under Knau 's chin , the viola spoke with a broad , country accent of the fatted bull that could not get to its feet in the stable , speaking in complaintof the menace of boar and unlicensed hunter , and the need of a horse in place of an ox behind the plow . It was clear that only the boy was pure enough to receive God 's illumination on his flesh ; only on him , as he played , did the pale light seem to fall . " Aber heute ist Sonntag , and apes ist vorbei ! " the voices stated with conviction , and even if this was not true , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for once , came as friends would come , by daylight instead of furtively in the twilight of evening or at dawn , or to stalk the woods like outlaws under cover of the dark . And now the Colonel and Stephany moved aside in relief , and the Oma ceased to beat time with her flexible-soled shoe , for one of the blond children , pushing a doll carriage , had come through the parlor door . In the doll carriage lay a soiled white hen , its head on the pillow , a pink doll blanket tucking its ailing body in . The hen 's bright , avid eye was turned sharply on the lot of them , and its beak seemed ready to open in venom and hurl a curse upon them all . The Oma stooped to settle the blanket closer around its scrawny neck , and " Squawk ! " said the hen in such coarse abuse that the boy lifted his fingers from the organ keys , and Herr Knau lowered his bow , and the singers ' voices died . That was late afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel had planned it , except that the boy went with them . He had just turned sixteen , this son called Walter , Knau had said , and it was time he saw a full-scale hunt . Knau and the others got into the station wagon with thep202guns and rocked away , and Jaeger and Walter set out on foot . At first it was not easy for them to speak , for Walter 's dreams , or the presence of the hymns , or the assemblage of thoughts in his head , were like a veil between them . His long fingers wove and unwove , and wove again , the string of a cat 's cradle as they walked down the village street , and then drew the cradle taut in his spread hands . But when he began to speak of the oak that had been planted at the gateway of the forest on the day of his birth , the words came easily . Gateway , he called it , as if the oak would swing back on iron hinges to let them pass , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An apple tree had been planted in the orchard for his brother , and a pear tree at the birth of his sister , and his was the oak , he said . If they entered the forest at the place where it stood , then the witches would let them be . Now they were skirting the fields , and the voices of larks could be heard high above them , and around them the separate and minute evening celebration of the myriad birds . Walter moved , long-legged and vulnerable , like a young giraffe , beside Jaeger , watching , watching , for what might be taking shape in the grass . " I 've always taken good care of my tree , and now it has grown taller than I am , " he said . " I covered its roots with fresh dung when the winters were cold , and I carried it pails of water every evening of the summer drought . That was last year , and the cattle were dropping dead in the fields , struck by the sun . " He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with worms one summer , and his brother had come down with worms ; and when his sister 's pear tree had lost its blossoms in the wind one early May , her hair had fallen out in handfuls the same week , and not grown back until the tree was putting forth its buds again . Becauseof the light that had seemed to fall on his face as hep203played ( the poet 's , the prophet 's , the saint 's illuminated face ) , there seemed nothing strange in all these things he said . He rolled the string of the cat 's cradle with painstakingcare , and put it into the pocket of his corduroys . " The witches come out in the early morning and the early evening , " he said , and his voice was low . " Oh , the witches ! " said Jaeger . " I tell you , in our countrythere 's always some kind of menace . " Our country , he had said . Our country . " There always has to be . At this moment , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now , " said Walter , the loping , tentative , giraffelikestride bringing him closer to Jaeger . " You do n't have to say it so loud . " The faces of the summer flowers had become as luminous as stars in the tall grasses on either side of the path , and now the precarious clarity of evening opened wide about them . Jaeger thought of the wild things that would stir , unseen , in the long twilight , that were even stirring now , and he was impatient with his own anxiety . " I do n't know much about witches , " he said , " but they tell me there 's nothing as tenacious about life as a boar . They can endure more than expellees , more than refugees , if you can believe it , more than Jews can , even , these Germanboar , " he said in abrupt irritation with them because they would not die . " Even a shot straight through the heart or the head wo n't finish them off , nine times out of ten . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' should be written on their coat-of-arms , for enough of it endows men and beasts with a kind of second life . " " Does it ? " said Walter , his voice wondering . " Does it ? Is that really true ? " " Oh , yes , " said Jaeger . " You can outwit a witch by the way you take into the forest , but you 're not going to fool a boar . "  | " Hush , " said Walter . " Hush , " his face as white as the flower faces around them in the dusk . " But we have to have them , just as England has to have her constant scourge of rabbits , bunny rabbits nibbling her vegetables away , " he went on , trying to make it funny for the boy . " In our forests , in our eternal dark underbrush , we have these brave , stubborn pigs . " Our forests , our underbrush , he heard himself saying . He did not remember when he had spoken like this before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , but they are also as fierce as tigers . They 'll battle the dogs when they 're cornered and shot  --  as the Jews fought tooth and nail for their lives , " he added withoutwarning , not knowing that he would say it or why it was said . He did not remember having spoken that word to any German since the war . " They tell me they never cry out , but with bullets pumped through them and intestines ripped open , they 'll leap to their feet and shake off the pack , and thrash out at man  --  " " The Jews ? " said Walter , his voice wondering still . " Yes . Well , yes , " said Jaeger . " But I was speaking of the boar . " " I can tell you a story about Jews , " said Walter , and then he stopped speaking . They had come to the edge of the forest , and in the stillness that hung in a bluish veil , and yet flooded like water over the country , Walter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young tree . " This is my oak , " he said . Behind them , the open land was going dim , and here , at the threshold of the woods , an even more impenetrable shadow was cast on leaf , and rock , and branch . " You touch the tree , too , and then there will be nothing to fear , " said Walter , and Jaeger pressed the cool side of the tree an instant with his open hand . Then they moved cautiously into the area of trunks and brush , keeping to the left flank , as the Colonel had or/dered ; and here a path was worn in the rich , ancient earth , perhaps by Walter 's feet alone on the journeys he made to his rooted , tough-leafed identity . And now that his being had been purged by ritual , wiped clear of all images , all faces , all sounds , except those of the story he wanted to tell , he began speaking of it again . " I knew a Jew last year , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jew . She was not the way they say Jews are . In the war , she 'd been in a place where people died , and when the war was finished she went to another place where all the lost children were . She was ten years old when she came to Ober-Pastau , and she lived a few months with a family in the village , waiting . She was waiting for them to find her mother and father for her , because they got lost during the war . She used to come and sing when I played the organ , but my father did n't like her to come because sometimesJews carry diseases . That 's why they had to put them away together during the war . So she and I used to walk down to my oak tree all that summer , and I showed her the way to enter the forest , " Walter said . Before them , the small voices of crickets fell silent , and spoke tentatively behind them again when they had passed . " One night she climbed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where she was staying , and no one ever saw her again , " Walter whispered . " She must have got tired of waiting . And I cried ; I cried for a long time after she was gone . She could have got lost in the forest . But nobody knows . She could have got caught , you know  --  caught , and turned into something different from a girl . " There seemed nothing strange to Jaeger in the story that Walter now began to tell , and nothing to wonder at that he wanted to tell it as they moved through the faintly breathing , faintly murmuring , beginning of the dark.  |p206It  musthave been country like here in Ober-Pastau , Walter said , and although it was June now , Jaeger could see the snow lying over the hills , and the wind sweeping it off the surface of the roads , baring the black ice underneath , and moving on across the fields . He could see the entire world armored in ice , for Walter said that when the story began , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and everything had died of the cold that month , that year . Trees were frozen upright , without so much as a crow to give life to their branches , and nowhere was there any sign of flesh andblood . Flesh and blood . Flesh and blood . If you had saidthese words aloud then , they would have begun to steam like fresh dung on the air . Everything that lived seemed to have fled from this country that had lost the war ; except the small figure of a child could be seen walking along the road . " You knew it was a girl because of the pieces of hair that lay on the collar of the overcoat , " Walter said , each detail as clear in his mind as if he had watched through a windowas she came . " They hung out from under her hood , the pieces of hair , and the hood was knitted wool , so you knew it belonged to a girl . But the rest of the clothes were men 's clothes . I saw them . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer , " he said . The sleeves of the overcoat were turned back nearly to her elbows , and still they were too long for her , and the coat was buttoned down tight below her knees , and someone had cut the rest of it off to make it the right size . Strips of sacking were bound around her feet , but they did n't keep her feet warm . But she had been walking a long timep207with hunger and cold as her companions , and she did n't want to argue with them any more . ( " I 'm telling you the story exactly the way it was , " said Walter . " She told it to me so many times that I know . She did n't have the sacking around her feet in the summerwhen she came here , but I 'm talking about the winter when she was walking still . I never could understand the story very well , so she told it to me over again every time we walked down to my tree together . She said the coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so did the Wehrmacht trousers they 'd cut down for her , and so did the grey canvas bag on her back . " ) She knew she could n't carry these things much farther , but she did n't want to give up now when she had come this far . Her head was lowered against the wind , and when she came around a bend in the road , she looked up , and there she saw the houses huddled together . Icicles as tall as men hung from their eaves , and there were frost flowers on the windowpanes , so she knew it must be warm inside them . The ends of her fingers had come through her gloves , and she looked at the white tips of them as she knocked at the first door , and then she put her hands quickly back in the pockets of the overcoat again . The woman who opened the door did n't open it very far , just enough to hear the little girl asking where Hoff nung was , but not enough to let the cold enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the sign at the turn of the road ahead , and the little girl looked across the snow at the words of direction written in Polish as well as German , for she could read Polish as easily as German now . ( " But they were n't her languages , " Walter whispered toJaeger as they walked . " She had another language , but shecould n't remember what it was . It had been too long ago . " ) " You 'll find stone sentry boxes marking the entrance top208the camp . It used to be an S.S. camp , " said the woman . Behind her skirt , the little girl could see a red strip of fire where wood burned in the grate of the stove . " It used to be very well kept up , with soldiers in fine winter uniforms , but times have changed . Now there are twenty or thirty thousand foreigners up there in Hoffnung . People who have no homes , " the woman said in blame . " Yes . Hoffnung 's the place , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go . " " So you 're a foreigner , too ? " said the woman . " I 'm not sure what I am , " the little girl said , " but I think I 'm going to find my mother and father up there , and then I 'll know . I can speak Polish very well now . I learned it on the way . " " So how long have you been on the way ' ? " asked the woman . She closed the door a little more so that the heat would not get out and the cold would not get in . " It was summer when I began to walk , " the little girl said . " I wanted to get to Hoffnung because they say that 's where the parents are waiting for the children to come . " ( " The story is hard to understand , " Walter interrupted the murmured telling of it . " Sometimes when I think of it , I do n't understand it at all , and other times it 's almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as explicitly as if it had happened to him , and more than that : as if nothing else that had ever happened in his life had the same hard , indisputableveracity . ) " Where have you slept every night since the summer ? " the woman asked , perhaps believing nothing that had been said . " Sometimes people gave me beds , and sometimes I slept with the cattle . It was better with the cattle , " said the little girl . " It was warmer there . " " Ah-ha ! " said the woman . " That 's what I thought ! If itp209was summer , you would n't have worried about being warm . You have n't been walking that long at all . " " Yes , " the little girl said . " When I slept with the cattle , winter or summer , it was better . It was not so lonely there . " " But you did n't learn Polish from the cattle ! " the woman said , closing the door until only a thread of warmth was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who walk on the roads , " said the little girl . " Well , you 'll find enough of them up there ! " the woman said , and she closed the door all the way . The little girl passed the empty sentry boxes , and came around the shoulder of the hill , and she had trouble putting one foot before the other because the snow had drifted with the wind , and here it was above her knees . When she saw the first grey stone buildings , she thought maybe the faces she had known a long time ago were waiting and watching for her at the windows , and then she saw the military cars drawn up and hooded with snow before the steps , and she went on by . It must be higher up , beyond , among the twenty or thirty thousand others , that the parentswould be , for she could see the smoke of the kitchen fires rising above the needle trees . And , at the top , she came to snow-packed streets that were like the streets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evening was beginning to close its arms around the world again . ( " It was about this time of day , " Walter whispered , for the wild game in the forest must not hear them coming ; " except it was January instead of June . The dusks are short in winter , not like now . " He had scarcely finished speaking when a faint , weary bleating could be heard before them in the undergrowth , and they halted . It seemed to be there , just ahead in the tangle of the forest floor , and they moved again , feeling their way toward it in the dark . " A week ago , we lost a young lamb , and Mutti goes to thep210stream with the children in the evening and watches for it to come to the water to drink , " Walter said . Jaeger was kneeling on the ground now , and his hand fell on its matted coat , on the small skull crowned with burrs and thistles ; and the lamb 's mouth nuzzled and sought for the ends of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It might not be a true lamb , but a witch that has taken this shape to put a spell on us , " Walter whispered . " It spoke my name . I heard it . " He would not come any nearer . " It cried Walter , Walter ' ! " he said . " Witch or not , I 'm going to tie it here so that we 'll find it on our way back , " said Jaeger . " We ca n't carry it with us . Its bleating would scare things off . Give me the string you have in your pocket , " he said , and Walter reached out from where he stood and put the string of the cat 's cradle in his hand . For a while , the lamb 's voice called after them , called piteously and grievously , and the farther they went , the less it seemed a Iamb 's voice , and more the voice of a child that cried for succor through the trees . As if to efface the sound of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , until wandering child and wandering lamb became interchangeable to Jaeger , and he did not want to think of them in the man-ridden and fox-ridden night ) . " In the first street she came to , there were people walking , just like in a village , " Walter was saying . He said there were women with market baskets on their arms , perhaps going home to make the soup , and men in work clothes , going home at the end of the day . When a group of children came by , the little girl began walking with them through the twilight , walking toward warmth and food and the parents , for this was the direction that children would know . But one girl cried out in Polish : " We 're not to go back to our houses now ! We 're to go top211the entertainment hall first ! There 's something happening there ! " The children were happy when they heard this , and the little girl thought that perhaps in the entertainment hall all the mothers and fathers would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children would go rushing down the aisles . They would take the red plush seats the parents had saved for them , and the smallest would be taken on the parents ' knees , and they would watch the stage with their mothers ' and fathers ' arms around them , and after a while the music would begin . It had happened to her somewhere before , in another country . She could remember the height of the ceiling , and the light dying in the chandeliers , and the people seated on red-cushioned seats , and the curtains parting . But she did not know the name of the city , or the country even , where this had taken place . " Appolina , Teodor , Antoni ! " the girl who had spoken called out to the younger children . She was a thin , beautifulgirl , with sad eyes , and she wore a blue handkerchief tied over her head . " Izabela , Ryszard , Sofia ! " she called to them , the way a mother would call out to her children . Now they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow-filled square , and although the small children waited at the bottom of the steps , the big boys stopped making snowballs and ran boldly up and turned the handles of the double doors . The light that poured down the steps made a passage through the cold , and the tall girl led them up this corridor , the wood of their boot soles ringing out like the boots of an army on the stone . " Sofia , Antoni , Izabela , Teodor , be quiet now ! " she said to them , and they did not talk or laugh any more after going through the doorway of the entertainment hall . ( " Twice , " Walter interrupted himself again , stopping now in the dark , " I saw a stranger in the woods , once inp212May by my oak , and the second time right here . Right where I 'm standing now , " he whispered , " maybe two weeks ago . " The first time , he had kept his hand on the trunk of his oak , and nothing had happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a gun on his shoulder , but whether he was tall or short , native or foreigner , he could not say . " The first time , I stayed so quiet by my oak that a spider spun her web between the sleeve of my jacket and my tree , " Walter whispered , " so that kept me from any harm . But the second time , I saw the ferns and violets right through his legs . " So he could have been made of mist , or glass , or running water . " It was n't quite dark , and he passed so close that I saw the blood of animals underneathhis nails , " Walter said . ) Then they went on , walking softly , and Walter took up the story of the little girl again , saying she had gone into the hall with the other children , and it was not like a theater , for there were no red plush-covered seats , and no stage , and no curtains that would part or rise . There were benches set in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there were no mothers and fathers sitting there . There were only children , hundreds of children , some scarcely able to walk , with older brothers and sisters beside them , and others with schoolbags on their backs , and the little girl walked down the aisle and found a seat , and slipped the straps of the canvas bag from her shoulders , and sat down . There was no music playing , and none about to play . But two men in uniform had climbed up on the platform , and one began to speak . " Some of you here this evening will remember me , " he began saying , speaking in Polish to them . There were coloredribbons and medals on his breast . " You will remember that I came here two months ago and spoke to all the chil/dren who have no parents in the camp . Poland still needs those sons and daughters who remain abroad . " " Is he St. Nicholas ? " the little boy called Ryszard whispered . " Maybe he 's God , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the tall girl said . " Perhaps you will remember the nice trip we offered to every child , " the officer said , clearing his throat . He was dark-haired and young , and he gave a wide , friendly look to the hundreds of children before him in the hall . " And now I want you to know that we are offering the same thing to everyone again . You may remember that I spoke about a train , a special children 's train , with all kinds of things in it that you would like , very different from any train you 've ever seen . I know many of you came to Hoffnungin trains , but they were freight trains , they were n't special children 's trains . You had to stand up in the cars you came in the way cows and horses do when they go for a trip . " He smiled out across the rows of benches , wantingthem to laugh at this , but they did not laugh . " This train , this special train , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little beds that you can climb into and go to sleep in , and it has real sheets and blankets that you can pull up over your heads . " The children had begun to talk among themselves , and the boy called Antoni turned in his chair to the tall girl who held Izabela in her lap . " Stanislawa , what are sheets ? " he asked her . " Hush , " she whispered , leaning forward . " They are white linen coverings for beds . They come between you and the blanket , and between you and the mattress , very clean and nice  --  " " And in this special train that was made just for you , "  |p214the  Polish officer was saying , " there are bright silver basins with spigots that you turn , and water runs out of the spigots into the basins . " The children murmured aloud at this , and then they listened again when the officer spoke of the pillows they would have to put under their heads . " You climb into these beds in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was telling them , " and when you wake up a wonderful thing will have happened . It will happen to you just as it happened to all the other children who left here with us two months ago . When you wake up , you will be in your homeland ! After the terror of the German Occupation , after all the years of moving from place to place , you will be back in Poland . You will be home again at last ! " He stood smiling at them from the platform , while the other officer looked down at his papers on the table , and shuffled them , getting ready to speak . " Last time I was here , the children ran out of the hall and packed up their things , " the first officerwent on , " and they were able to go off the next day in the special children 's train . This much you know , but you do not know that just before the train went off every boy in it was given a game and a picture book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could keep . These were new games , and new books , and dolls , and they never had to be given back . That was the first train to leave Hoffnung , and tomorrow the second train will be going , and it will be a finer one than the first train , for this one has a diningroomin it , a dining-car , and you can sit down and have your dinner at little tables , all of you , tomorrow night . " ( " I 'm telling you the story the way she told it to me . Whenever we went to my oak , she told it , " Walter whispered to Jaeger . " I 've never told it to anyone before . " ) The other officer picked up his papers from the table , and he straightened his shoulders , for now it was his turn to speak.  | " You have heard all about the children 's train , so now I will tell you about the special things that are waiting for you when you get back to Poland , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , and he spoke sadly and gently to them , glancing down every now and then at the papers in his hand . " The place where you will go is not a large settlementsuch as you live in here with thousands of grown peoplefrom different countries in it . It is a camp that has been arranged , just as the train has been , especially for you , especially for Polish children . There are playgrounds waiting for you there , and there are many unusual attractions , " he said , referring to the paper he held . " There are , among other things , sand piles , swings , slides , and a swimmingpool . And that is not all . For the older children , there are many opportunities offered for education . There are trade schools for girls as well as boys , special trainingcourses , and many other unusual  --  " He sought for another word for a moment , but could not find it , and so he repeated : " attractions . You can learn to be carpenters , masons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , filled with a singular sadness , as if his heart was somewhere else . " Poland needs engineers , technicians , doctors , lawyers , teachers , and professors , clerks , officers , priests , and men in other walks of life . Each young person is free to choose the work he or she wishes , and to follow the courses which seem best suited to his or her abilities . Warsaw is rising from the ruins .... " There was a stir of unrest in the hall because of the monotonyof it , and because suppertime was near , and the young officer interrupted the other with a smile . " Before you go on , Captain , " he said , " may I speak to the children of one other aspect of the future ? May I just mention the children 's families who are waiting in Poland ? " The children 's faces turned at once to him , and silence fellp216on the benches ; no piping , childish voices asked to leave the hall now , and no fretful cries were heard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memories of the older ones had been transmitted magically to those they held on their knees . " Now , I know all of you , " the officer said in his pleasant , friendly voice , " would like to have news of the parents you have been separated from for so many years . Well , that is another thing we are ready to promise you . Here you have been living with guardians , with people who have befriended you , but who are not people of your own blood . In many cases , you have become very much attached to them , for they have been kind to you . But what future awaits you if you stay abroad ? You will have a difficultlife among strangers , among those who can never be the same as your mothers and fathers , while at home you will find a hearty welcome , and the love of those nearest and dearest to you , and the future will mean working for the well-being of your own land . " The smile was fixed , immovable , on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform , looking up and down and backwards and forwards across the hall , his eyes moving swiftly across the rows . " So when this meeting is over , stop at the door on your way out  --  all of you  --  and show your identity card to the officer who will be waiting at a table in the hall . He will write down in his book your names , and the names of the towns where you were born , and that means you will be put on the list of the children who are going home tomorrowon the special train . This is your own decision to make , " he said , and , although he smiled still , his face seemed to darken . " Do not let others change your minds . Special food rations will be given to every repatriated child , to every boy or girl who decides to go home to the towns where they were born . " The shadow that had fallen on his handsome face lifted now as he went on saying :  | " There is therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow ! Your names will be sent ahead of the train by telegram , so that all the towns will know ! " It seemed to them , then , that this was the way it was going to happen . In that moment of quiet when the officer'svoice ceased , they believed that their names would run like messengers before them , and that the syllables would be called out from street to street , from rooftop to rooftop , of the towns of their own country ; and as the sound of their names rang out , the people they belonged to would spring up with cries of recognition , and would come hastening to the stations at which the special train stopped , and crowd upon the platforms as the cars pulled in . " Antoni , Ryszard , Sofia , Izabela ! " the voices of the mothers and fathers would shout down the years . " Stanislawa , Teodor , Appolina , Josef , Waldemar , Antonia ! " These imperishablenames would be heard above the whistling and rattlingof the special train , and even above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had given the children their flesh , their blood , louder than the clamor of any church bells at Christmastime , and than any organ music thunderingacross the winter air . All this went undisputed , filling them with wonder , until a dark , thin boy jumped to his feet in the middle of the hall . A purple scarf was wound several times around his neck , and the thickness of this scarf made him hold his head up as if in pride . His hair was black and curly , and uncombed , on his skull , and he faced the Polish officers without any sign of fear . " No . That is n't true , " he said in a strained , high voice . " Our parents are not there . " The children 's faces now turned to him , but almost in impatience , seeing his hair was too long , his cheeks too hollow , not wanting to hear the things he said . " My father was killed in 1940 . I saw himp218killed , " he was saying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . My mother died in 1944 in a camp where we were together . I wrote the date down . " His voice was thin and high in the silence of the entertainment hall . " This boy , here , " he said , and when he gestured it could be seen that the jacket he wore was too small for him , and that his wrists hung long and red from the tight sleeves . ( " Like my corduroy jacket , " Walter whispered , not saying : The wrists could have been mine , could n't they , Herr Jaeger ? The voice could have been mine . That 's why I do n't understand it . I do n't understand why they were n't mine . " My corduroy jacket 's getting too small for me the way his was , " he said . ) " He and his parents were brought into Silesia by the Germans , " the boy went on saying in the entertainment hall . " His mother and father worked in an ammunition factory , and he saw the factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? That was three years ago , and he saw it , and now you tell him he 'll find them again in Poland ! In some of us there is perhaps a little hope , not much hope , and not in many of us , but still a little hope is left to us who did not see them die ! " His voice had gone thinner , shriller , and now , without any warning , he flung at them the words of furious , adult obscenity . When that was done , he became a child again , and cried : " How can you make these promises to us when you do not know ? " And now the situation must be saved , for the sake of the children it must be saved , and the tall girl called Stanislawa put Izabela onto the lap of the next child , and stood up from the bench . The young officer moved uneasily on the platform , and the older one reshuffled his documents , his eyes lowered under his grey brows . Stanislawa curtsied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe me , sirs , " she cried out across the children'sp219heads to them ; " believe me , all of us here wish to go home ! " She stood like a statue , a monument , above the seated children , and on the tide of their bewilderment , their faces drifted helplessly toward her . " But where is there for us to go back to when we remember  --  we who are old enough  --  we remember everything ? You ask us to return to a special camp where there will be playgrounds for the children , and schools , and swimming-pools , and to wait there until our parents come . But our parents will not come for us , never , never . They can not come . It is no longer possible for them to come . " She looked with anxious , despairing eyes around the hall , but whatever had been ready to break in her voice faltered only for an instant , and then she went on speaking clearly and strongly again . " My brothers and sisters who are here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have been my children , Ryszard , Antoni , Sofia , and Appolina , " she said . " Whatever they saw six years ago , they have forgotten . Believe me when I tell you , sirs , that there are no parents left for us to go back to , not for any of us here ! " And now , one after another , the children on the benches began crying , but unlike the way in which children cry . It happened like this : a child in the back of the hall would cover his face with his hands , and then another , and still another , would bow his head , until it seemed to the little girl that whichever way she looked there were children cryingsilently . But this crying made no demands , shouted out no accusations , asked for nothing , not even to be heard , voices and tears having been separate so long a time that neither was part of the other any more . The older ones  --  those who did not have the right to succumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces with the ends of their scarfs , bit into them , even , to keep the sound of cry/ing in , while their bodies shook as if their hearts were tearingslowly apart inside their breasts . Even Stanislawa had failed them now . The little girl closed her eyes so as not to see them , and the hard , dry pain came into her throat . If you do n't let your mouth take the shape of crying , then you ca n't cry , she told herself . But she had been walking a long time , and she had not eaten since morning . She had come a long way to the place called Hoffnung , and it did not seem to be the place , after all , where the parents were waiting . ( " I do n't understand the story , " Walter said again . ) The fluid night had closed like water on their mouths , and sealed their eyes . They were the only two swimmers left in the current , greased and masked with black for a channel crossing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inasmuch as all foothold was illusion , they being swimmers , not walkers , swimmers drifting out of the reach of each other 's hands , almost beyond the reach of the everwideninglassos of each other 's voices . They were alone in a black sea , so far from other men that the sound of the gun firing far to the right did not concern them , and Jaeger felt no shame when the tears came to his eyes . ( Oh , God , why tears , tears of pity for what , self-pity , Walter-pity , pityfor all men whose loves have been denied them , pity because there is only one co-citizen humble enough to swim with me through the black waters without foothold or destinationor estimate of the distance covered , without passingverdict on those who have not undertaken the crossing from the familiar mainland of hearth and home , from the unalterable names of table and chair , to the floating continentof mythical foliage and beasts that speak man 's name aloud ? The tears are not for the children in the story , Walter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the same reasonthat I will not understand it , for we know it is not thep221story of a child who walks the roads of a country seeking the flesh and blood of his people , but that the child is man , his heart lifting in hope at the smell of honeysuckle or the sound of a singer 's deep voice , man seeking his own perjuredidentity , either wandering a country road , or groping through a forest , or at a copy desk , feeling his way from word to word ; and who the officers on the platform of the entertainment hall may be , I can not tell you ; perhaps merely the givers of easy answers , or wrong directions , merely the false prophets offering their meaningless jargon to harassed man . ) And then the second blast of gunfire came , closer to them , splitting the night wide open . It was , again , a single shot , but this time the reverberation of it ran a crooked course , carving like a scalpel of lightning through wood and stone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still night poured over them were fixed to the earth now , rooted like trees , the sap halted in them . " That was on the other side , down near the lumber road this time , " Jaeger said , whispering it , although the need for silence had been shattered with the night . " Ja , ja , " said Walter . His fingers closed , cold and shaking , on Jaeger 's hand . " Let us get back to my oak . Let us get there quickly , " he said . Jaeger led the way , drawing the boy on with him , seeing nothing , the mere acquiescence of the earth underfoot confirming that this was the path by which they had come . In another moment , the lamb would bleat , and they would kneel in the underbrush and grope for it , and the blunt nose would nuzzle for comfort against their hands . Jaeger would untie the string at its neck , and lift it , weightless , as the starving , the dying , are without substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They would pass the oak , pressing it with their open palms , and move along the edge of thep222marsh , talking as loudly as they pleased now that death had been dealt by the hunters and authorized the wide , dark night to speak . ( While I walk , the oil well at Flegendorf is still burning , thought Jaeger , giving the fields around it the color of flesh and blood ; the blind student is talking still of the Wahrungsreform as he taps his way down the halls of learning ; the Zimmermann upholds his honor with eternal hammer and triangle ; the Lipizzan horses still leap to the sound of Christoph 's voice in the ring ; the Herr Graf speaks unceasingly of the revolt of the ignorant and the unlettered that is moving across the face of Europe ; of all my countrymen , only the Wehrmacht soldier has changed his role : he no longer scratches and claws for freedom in the sealed halls of the air-raid shelter , no longer surrenders to the Russians , having surrendered to death in the ambulance that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Walter ? After survivingfour years of entombment , what arrant effrontery ! ) Indeed , the night was authorized to speak , but they did not know it would suddenly cry out in terror . They did not know that teeth would be sunk into its throat , tearing from it scream after dying scream . The sound of it stopped them short in the dark , and Walter stood moaning , swaying against Jaeger , his hands covering his ears so as not to hear this brutal ravishing and murdering of the night . Jaeger put an arm around his shoulders and held him fast , feeling his own heart trembling in him . And then it was done ; it was completely over ; there was nothing left but the flight of airy feet through the leaves . " The lamb . He got the lamb , " Jaeger said . The stench of fox was drifting , as smoke drifts , slowly rising , unfurling , on the windless air . " Ja , ja , but it was like a child screaming , " Walter said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he could not stop his shuddering . " We should have taken it withp223us when we went . We should have known , we might have known that ... " " Yes , " said Jaeger . He wanted the night to breathe and murmur again , to speak with the small , bright voices of crickets . " I should have carried it inside my coat , " he said . They did not see the lights of any car on the lumber road as they walked back to the village , but there in Knau 's courtyardstood a handsome green station wagon , only it was not the Colonel 's car . It was parked by the dungheap , its lights extinguished , the faint wash of lamplight through the kitchen windows turned bright and garish on its chromium armor and its Simonized flank . The rear door was open , and the short figure of a man bent in the shadows , busied with what lay within . At the sound of footsteps on the cobbles , he straightened , and they saw the silk of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tan-colored straw hat that was set on the side of his head . " Well , hi , Herr Jaeger ! " the opera singer 's voice called out , warm as a friend 's , after the first instant of recovery . He took a step forward , and then thought better of it , and took a step back . His mouth was smiling , but not quite with ease . " It 's a pleasure , but an unexpected one , to see you here ! " Dardenella said . He placed the hat , with its smartly pleated , flowered band , at a more casual angle , his hands decked out in short , yellow gloves , unbuttoned at the wrists . " It was such a pretty night for Germany that I drove out to get some country air . Guten Abend , Walter . Walter'san old buddy of mine , " he said , standing between them and the station wagon 's open back door . " Gee , I remember when I was a kid , wanting to get that two weeks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting like crazy every summer , and a couple of summers it did n't come through ! I remember that ! And there I was stuck in a placep224called Brooklyn where only one tree grows ! " He was laughingas he crossed his arms over , the links of the bracelet light and loose on his wrist . He leaned against the end of the car , one foot cocked in its neatly fitting suede shoe . " Are you doing some kind of business out here , Herr Jaeger ? " he said , his voice filled with kindliness and warmth , wanting to be on Jaeger 's side , asking for nothing but just that in return . " Yes . Interpreting for the Colonel , " Jaeger said . Whateverwas taking place , he wanted to make it explicit for this little man with his dark , yearning eyes lashed so luxuriantly , richly , like a horse 's eyes . " We left the rest of them back in the woods , lost track of them . There was shooting , so they may be bringing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephany , and Honerkamp , and the forester , Knau . " " Oh , a party ! I would n't want to intrude , then , " Dardenellasaid . " I 'd better be getting on my way . " The Colonel'sname had changed the look of things , had altered the sweetness of the evening air , and Dardenella turned quickly now , and closed the station-wagon door . He twisted the key , and drew it out , and tried the handle . Then he dropped the key in his jacket pocket , and dusted off the palms of his gloves . " Herr Jaeger , I 'm not fooling about the country air , " he said , " but I 'd like to give you the straight story of what I 'm doing here . " With the side of his left shoe , he scraped a farmyard deposit from the other sole , looking down , smiling uneasily . " Once a week , I drive out here to pick up first-class feed for the horses , for my Lipiz zan babies . I come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and crested dog's-tail , and rye grass , and yel low oat grass , and cocksfoot , and sweet vernal . I know them all . I 've studied the books , " he said , still smiling . " I come out here , and I do n't know whether it 's a black-mar/ket deal I 'm putting over , or what it is , and I do n't want to know . I just want the best I can get for the two of them , for Neapolitano Virgilia and the mare . I guess I do n't care if I 'm breaking some kind of law , Herr Jaeger . I guess it 's come to that . " He moved away from the station-wagon window , and he laid his small , gloved hand on Jaeger 's forearm . " Just look inside there and you 'll see the hay . You can see it , ca n't you ? " he said . He had drawn Jaeger forward to look through the glass at the greenish sprays that lay on the station-wagon boards . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but scarcely enough for a week 's feed . " Maybe you heard about the horse fair they 're holding in Kneith in September , " Dardenella said , almost laughing in his eagerness . " Christoph Horn and me , we 're going down . There may be a Lipizzaner up on the block . We got a tip . I do n't want to say too much , but we 're going down to have a look . That would make three . " " But a horse like that , a Lipizzaner , " Jaeger said . He sought the right American phrase . " It would cost you a million . " " Yes . A million , a cool million ! " Dardenella said , and he liked the sound of it so much that he stood there laughing , looking up at Jaeger from under the tilted brim of the tan straw Stetson , his soft mouth warm and dark with his secrets , his teeth clear white as he laughed . " You see how it is , do n't you , Herr Jaeger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hay . Only , you understand , I would n't want the Colonel to know . " There was no question that it was hay . Jaeger had seen it in the square of light that the kitchen window cast on the station-wagon floor . But when Dardenella had driven away , there was something else : Frau Knau was busy in the kitchen as they came in , bearing the tall , brown , commissary bags in her arms , lifting them from the table and carryingp226them one by one , because of the weight , to the closet underneaththe stairs . " Guten Abend , Herr Jaeger , " she said , her voice and face entirely serene . " Come help me , Walter , to clear all this away . " There was no sign of it left by the time the Colonel 's party drove into the courtyard . Frau Knau and Walter had gone upstairs to bed half an hour before the twin stream of the headlights moved across the windows and swung , like the shafts of a lighthouse beacon , toward the pigsty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jaeger had sat alone in the kitchen of the waiting , silent house , and now he put out the end of his cigarette , and stood up from the table . It was not quite ten o'clock as the Colonel and Knau came through the door . " There 's been some trouble , Jaeger , " the Colonel said shortly . " Can you tell me where my daughter is ? " It might have been something to laugh at , the fact that she was gone again , if the look in the Colonel 's face had been different . But the flush of drink , the fire of energy , were gone from it , and he stood there , haggard , brooding , old . Behind him , Knau closed the door against the warmth and the involvement of the outdoor dark , his shoulders wooden as he moved , his eyes , under the black hat 's brim , blinking numbly in the light . " She was with Lieutenant Stephany , " Jaeger began , but the Colonel cut him short . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Somewhere , during that time , she gave Lieutenant Stephany the slip . He does n't even know which way she went . " Jaeger watched a pulse beating in his left jaw as the Colonel felt in his trouser pocket and brought out a handful of crumpled bills and coins . " You gave my wife some German lessons . I do n't remember how many , but take what I owe you outp227of this . I 'm wiping all my blackboards clean . " When he threw the money down on the table , two or three coins rolled over the edge and across the floor . " Take out for the interpreting , too , " he said . But nobody moved ; nobody spoke . Knau dared not cast so much as a glance at the coins on the floor , sensing , it may have been , the presence of something more final than money in the kitchen with them now . " I 'll go upstairs and ask the wife , " he said . When he moved , the Colonel did likewise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounting vaguely , almost will-lessly , where the forester led , perhaps for no better reason than because he did not know where else to go . And Jaeger , not having relinquished yet the interpreter 's role , followed after them . The upper hall was lit by one banging , unshaded bulb , and they passed under it in single file , Jaeger stooping a little so that he would not strike it with his head . Knau , his back and shoulders rigid , turned the knob of the first door . Even when he entered the bedroom , the Colonel followed him doggedly , blindly , his mind and anger somewhere else , his step that of an older , broken man . Jaeger paused only an instant on the threshold , and then he followed behind the Colonel into the room . Knau had switched on a light on the dresser , and , along the east wall , the beds could be seen now , four of them , to judge from the wooden headboards , but the four of them pushed together to form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure white featherbeds ballooned in the half-obscurity , and long white bolsters propped the sleeping heads . Frau Knau 's was first . She lay a little in from the edge , leaving space , it might be , for Knau to lie beside her . When his labors would be done , he would take off his boots , and lay aside his ceremonious black , slip the suspenders free from his shoulders , lay his pants across a chair , and , with nop228more than this as preparation for the night , he would enter the clean white bed . Her braids were unpinned now , and one of them , tapering like a serpent 's tail , lay long across the laundered casing . The gathered shoulders of her heavy nightgown could be seen , and the buttons fastening the neck . Next to her lay the side of Walter 's face , restored to childhood as he slept , his ear and cheekbone flushed . And then came the Oma 's neat , gnome-like head , encased in a nightcap , the white ribbons of it tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the reach of the lamplight  --  the blond children lay , their heads turned dark against the bolster 's white . The shadows of the far corner had fallen like wings across them , so that for a moment the men did not see the third head there . It lay between the children 's heads , the hair fanning wide behind it flexible as satin , the brows more beautiful than Jaeger had remembered , the mouth , in sleep , pale as a flower , neither smiling nor grieving , merely untroubled , asking for nothing at all . " My God ! " said the Colonel . " There 's Milly over there ! " It seemed to Jaeger that he saw her for the first time now , the delicacy of her temples , her ears , the long , suave tilt of the closed eyes , the point of hair on her forehead as fine as the tip of an artist 's brush ; this face she always turned from them in misgiving now redeemed by sleep . It lay quite calmly on the bolster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel might have been seeing her clearly for the first time , too , for he held his breath as he tiptoed toward the bed . Just once he turned to look back across his shoulder , as if asking for help , and Jaeger saw that a glaze of tears lacquered each blood-shot eye . " Tell him he 'd better wake her and get started for Fahrbach , " Knau said to Jaeger , not speaking loud . " He 'd better get the man to a doctor now he 's found the girl . "  | " To a doctor ? " Jaeger repeated . He looked at Knau . " What man ? " " Out there in the car , " Knau said , but he did not finish , for the Colonel had begun to speak . He stood in the far corner of the room , looking down at the girl . " Milly , wake up . Morning time ! " he was saying , perhaps in remembrance of some childhood game they once had played . When she did not rouse , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white case of the featherbed high under her chin . " Milly , wake up ! " said the Colonel , but it broke his heart to do this . " We have to go quickly , Millykins . There 's been an accident . Honerkamp , he was shot . He 's bleeding like a stuck pig in the car . " " Honerkamp ? " Jaeger 's mind went blank and cold . " Honerkamp ? " he said . " There was somebody else out in the woods tonight , " said the Colonel . He straightened up and threw his shouldersback . Across the room , his eye met Jaeger 's eye . " Knau shot once . I say it was a roebuck we saw , he says a boar . He wanted to keep on through the forest after it , even withoutthe dogs , " he said , " so I let him go . Just before I hit the lumber road , coming back , somebody started blasting away . " But Jaeger did not hear the rest of it . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephany walked up and down , up and down , impatiently , moving between the dungpile and the car . " Honerkamp , good God , poor Honerkamp , " Jaeger said as he opened the station-wagon door . Honerkamp lay on the back seat , his face , in the light from the kitchen window , sapped of color , his mouth strangely dark and small . " It 's nothing , Jaeger , nothing , " he said , his mind , hit thoughts , on something else . " Did you find Milly ? " he said ,  | " She 's upstairs . She 's asleep , " said Jaeger . He was kneelingbeside him on the floor . On Honerkamp 's right arm , below the shoulder , was a tourniquet fashioned of the Colonel 's mottled scarf , and the wound in the forearm was bound by a stained cloth . The hand that lay on his chest was cold . So passive was this hand now , not leaping from plate to plate for food , from book to book on a library shelf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turmoil through his hair . " You 're cold , " said Jaeger , and he took off his coat , the brown jacket of ersatz wool with its slick undersleeves and its fraying cuffs , stretching it wide over Honerkamp 's shoulders and the beating of his heart.  |p231It  wasMonday morning , and Jaeger sat in the train that would carry him northward , a man again bereft of women , getting on now with the work there was to do . In the cellars of Kastel , the theater was coming to life , the political Stuben were satirizing Occupier and Occupied , and Borchert 's Draussen vor der Tttr was being played . It would make an article for the midweek edition , he thought as he looked through the window , his eyes seeing nothing , not even the beads of rain that merged into water snakes and writhed down the soot-fouled pane . The piece could be a depositionin his own terms concerning the dead and buried youth of Germany , and a salute to the violently alive who leaped , as if out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shout out their challenge to God , and nation , and official man , in uproarious travesty . At two , he would interviewFritzludwig , actor and producer as well , in a Weinstube off what remained of Kastel 's Hindenburgplatz . He would meet at five with the players of two political cafes as they went through the pages of the Hamburg and Berlin daily papers , and Der Spiegel , for news not yet twenty-four hours old to give fresh barbs of meaning to their acts . At eight , there would be Borchert 's comi-tragedy , acted under canvasstretched over a reconstructed stage , with the arches , and lobbies , and galleries of the demolished theater kibitzingin chaos from behind the audience 's back . And after the final curtain , he would make the rounds of the night-club Stuben that had been air-raid shelters once , where , under the debris of a ruined city , the lively farce of the Political Passion was being played . But now it was morning , thep232train had begun to move , and the houses of Fahrbach were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grind on its runners and cry out in protest . ' When he turned his head , he saw Catherine Roberts seeking to open it from the hall . " Jaeger , " she said , her lips shaping the name against the glass that stood between them . He had got to his feet , but his knees were stricken . He scarcely dared lift his eyes to see her , or breathe the air becauseof his fear of her scent . " You 're in Paris , " he said in a low voice as he jerked back the door . " You ca n't be here . " " Yes , yes , I know , " she said in confusion . She sat down , not looking at him as she spoke , but at the white fingers of the glove that she drew from her trembling hand . " Ephemeral , like the brewer , " she murmured . A half-inch of varnishedwood lay between the light linen of her dress and the brown wool of his trouser leg . " I took shape last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , talking quickly , smoothing out long and straight the fingers of her glove that lay on the woven handbag on her knees . " It took place in Seth Honerkamp 's room in the hospital . We walked every step of the way through the forest , walked it over again , I mean , looking for the stranger , the armed marauder , who was there that night . Each of us sees him in a different way  --  according to our prejudices , according to our tastes . " The damp of the rain had burnishedher hair to copper , and she seemed then more beautifulthan any woman man had dreamed of , purer , more delicately colored , than Botticelli 's Venus , but fashioned and destined for man 's single purpose like Cranach 's Eve . Ah , but something has happened to her in those days and nights in Paris ! Jaeger thought . His eyes moved in anguish over the pale shell of her ear , across her unblemished cheek ,  |p233down  the milk-white satin of her throat . Something had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temple and brow , each pore of her skin , a sun-struck lambency . Some man held her in his arms , and kissed her mouth , and touched her breasts , he thought in grief , listening to her speak of the stranger who had come and gone in the darkness of the woods . Ah , yes , in darkness ! he thought savagely . In the darkness of a hotel room ! Once , in his late schooldays , at a time when he knew nothing of America , he had written an essay placing the blame for the lack of moral values in American life on the collapse of the scaffolding of tradition that kept the social orders in their place . He remembered the simile well . Modern divergencies , he had written in young pomposity and ignorance , such as canned foods , had brought about the degeneration of the American people . They corrupted values according to their whims , the Americans , he wrote , allowing a workmanto become a senator , a businessman a general , a miner the owner of a mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him still that they split tradition up like firewood , condoning it if a married woman , a mother , an officer'swife , went to Paris and walked the streets in search of love , and found it , and carried the memory of it back like a lamp lit in her flesh . " It could have been none of the men who carried a gun that night . My husband checked every gun , and the ammunition , " Catherine Roberts was saying . Her head was lowered still , the shallow white cup of her temple level with his shoulder , the tapering of her eyebrowglossy and supple as a swallow 's wing . " Only the forestershot higher in the woods . You were there . You know that , too , " she said . " I see the man as a German , a peasant , who did n't turn in his arms at the surrender . My husband and Stephany see him as American , a civilian , of course , and , of course , of foreign extraction . My hus/band has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken into military custody . " But Paris , thought Jaeger . He could no longer bear to look at her . He thought of a shoemakerhe had known in Colorado , an old man who had left Germany while still a boy , promising his father and mother and priest that , wherever he wandered , whatever his destinationmight be , he would never at any time , in any year , pass through the cesspool of all that Paris was . He had emigrated by way of Italy , believing then , and still believing it sixty years later , that because he had never breathed the air of Paris , his flesh and his soul had not been branded by iniquity . Perhaps that belief lives in every German , in every one of us , thought Jaeger , and his heart went bleak with the knowledge of his own damnation , and the woman beside him seemed bright and hard as a pillar of salt , and her purity a spurious thing . " Only Seth showed no interest in tracking him down , " Catherine Roberts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to me it might be because he knew , or thought he knew . " Her eyes did not move from the woven straw of the handbag on her knees , and her hands moved quietly , not trembling now , smoothing out the empty fingers of the gloves with care . " My husband has never for a moment forgiven Seth for having got the Officers ' Club away from the army , and for having turned it into the America House . Never , never , waking or sleeping , sleeping or waking , " she said . " Seth was being serenaded last night from the hospital garden below his window , by oboe and flute and violin , it must have been , and he was more interested in that than in finding the man who had tried to take his life ; and interested in what you had written . " The low voice went on speaking quickly , refusing to stop for breath . " He read me the article on the Wehrmachtsoldier caught in the ruins , translated it word by word from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who buried his passport at the frontier , and his dollar bills with it , before walking across the border into Germany , expecting what flowering bush , what high tree , to grow there nobody knows . I think that is the way you wrote it . I think those were the words you used , " she said . " And Honerkamp told you I would be going to Kastel today ? " Jaeger said . If the words she had spoken were music to his ears , still he had no wish to hear them now . " Honerkamp told you that it is a city that has been nearly totally bombed , and that it was a place every American should see . I hope you brought your camera with you , " he said , his voice gone strained and evil in his mouth . " We did n't speak of Kastel , we did n't mention Kastel , " she said , and now her hands had ceased to move . " I telephonedthe newspaper . I wanted to tell you I was back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the German lessons could begin again . They said you were at the station , going away , and I got dressed , just throwing things on . That 's why my hair looks the way it does . " When she lifted her hand to put the shining tendrils back from her brow , her bare white forearm passed close to his mouth . " I could n't find you in the station , so I got on the train . It happened to be the only one there , " she said , sayingthese things quickly , breathlessly , as if fearing the other things that might be said . " As for the lessons , that might be difficult . Your husband , the Colonel , he feels you have learned enough , " he said , his voice still venomous . " Yes , " Catherine Roberts said . " I know . " " And still you telephoned the newspaper to ask that we go on with them ? " said Jaeger . He was outraged by her perfidy now . Ah , God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the chestnut trees on the boulevards go down screaming under the teethp236of the electric saw ! To see every bed in every Paris hotel dragged from the red plush and yellow satin upholstering of the rooms and burned in the Place de la Republique and the Place Vendome , and any other Place , to make a public spectacle of it ! To slash to a thousand ribbons every divan where she has lain with her lovers , to rip out the springs and guts of beds and men with my own hands , and leave them in the dismantled rooms , never again to reek with her scent , or groan beneath the ecstasies of her love ! " Yes , still I telephoned , " Catherine Roberts said , whisperingthe words scarcely aloud . " I could not bear it any longer  --  I mean , I did not wish to live any longer without seeing you . He did not know if it was he who was the first to move , or whether it was she who turned her head to him , but suddenlyhis hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him more fiercely , more tenderly , than he had ever done in dreams . Her bag , her gloves , slipped to the floor beneath their feet , and his mouth closed on the soft , moaningmusic of her mouth . A quivering tide poured through their nostrils , filled their lungs , suffocated them , so that each breathed only with the other 's breath . Now they were lost , borne farther and farther from all that had foothold in reality : the moving train , the falling rain , the unalterable demandsand meanings of their lives . And even as he perished , Jaeger cried out in incoherent rebuke : " Oh , Paris , Catherine ! Those days , those nights ! " " No , no ! " she whispered . " You are Paris , Jaeger , and all the nights and days , " the words as soft as her lips , her breasts , her body dying in his arms . " There has never been anything , anyone , before .... " They did not speak of a future , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might share together , as if this was accepted beyondp237speech , beyond conniving , as how things were to be . They walked hand in hand out of the devastation of the Kastel station , and saw that the rain had drawn aside for a moment , and this seemed like a promise made them , and they smiled . A perpendicular ray of sun , metallic as moonlight , fell like a blade through the somber grisaille of afternoon  --  it was just after twelve  --  and they stood looking across the stripped square for the sight of one hotel left standing above the rubble beyond , but the word " hotel " was not pronounced . It leaned there in memory , as pictured on postcards of Paris , or on theater backdrops , and in tinted illustrations : the Hotel de l'Univers et d'Angleterre , or du Commerce , or du Nord , supported on one side by the Hotel du Vingtieine Siecle , or du Terminus , and on other by the Hotel des Voyageurs or de la Gare . But no sign spoke out to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dump heaps of men 's lives and habitations , steaminga little in the rain-washed air , so that they seemed to smoke still , as if the bombs had fallen only the night before . " It has a terrible kind of beauty , " Catherine Roberts said , for now even the look of tragedy had been transformed into a spectacle for them , and they smiled at the miracle of each other 's faces . " Like Carthage , " she said , ready to laugh out loud . " There were crashed fighter planes lying in the fields even there , " said Jaeger , " around Carthage even . And the **25;2187;TOOLONG plows still drawn by oxen , detouring around them , going on turning the soil as they had in every other century , in every other year . " He held her arm hard against him , her hand fast in his hand . " We could take a walk through the streets , if you 're not tired , " he said . In all his life , there had never been anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roberts cried out , appalled by the mortal insult of it . But in each of their minds , the dark ,  |p238narrow  lobby led in from the shattered street to the worn desk , the counter , on which the register lay open , and the cage of the elevator mounted uncertainly to the dusty strip of carpet and the closed doors of the upstairs hall . Outside each door , the pairs of shoes stood , the man 's shoes and the woman 's side by side , the woman 's leaning , it might be , against the man 's , and none of them polished yet , but still marked with mud because they had walked a long time through the rubble in search of a place where a man and a woman might lie down together in the embrace of love . " How could I be tired ? " Catherine Roberts cried . She stood smiling , looking up at him . " You are wonderfully tall , " she said , and although there was no humor in it , still they laughed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Jaeger , his voice hard and fierce , his hand nearly breaking the pliable bones in her hand . " Would you take them off here so that I can see how really small you are , your head hardly reachingmy shoulder . I want you to do it here , in front of everyone , " he said . " Everyone ? " she repeated in wonder . She looked around her , amazed . And now that they took their eyes from each other , they saw that , despite the plague-stricken look of the square , there were others moving out of the station , some carryingbrief-cases , bags , some with umbrellas raised although the rain had ceased to fall . But none of them stopped to hold each other 's hands in love but crossed the square , knowingexactly to which black gaping entranceway , which crumblingmass , their business took them , going , with lowered heads , toward the halted heart of the town . In the first street that Catherine Roberts and Jaeger took there was no house left standing ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still they believed that in ap239moment they would come upon it , perhaps just beyond the next broken facade , on the other side of the next rampart of debris , at the end of the next shattered arcade . And although in the second street , and in the third , there was still no sign , still their hearts were no less certain , and they put their concern with it aside . As they walked , they spoke of America , arm pressed in arm , the sound of the name fillingthem with elation , as if that was the next door that would open into the widening hallway of their lives . " Most of Florida has been ruined , but still there are parts where the land and the vegetation have not given in , " Catherine Roberts said , her head lowered , watching their feet walking side by side . " You can fight your way through that wilderness , or you can skim your way over the surface of it in special boats , air-boats , they call them . I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Their eyes sought the length of another street they had turned into , and came back gently , shamelessly , to each other 's faces again . " We were stationed at Fort Lauderdale before the war , and the pinelands , the cypress swamps , the trees hangingwith Spanish moss , were stranger than any foreign country I 've ever known . Flocks of white herons , and blue herons , and red-necked vultures , and everywhere that junglemoss , " she was saying , giving the tropical look of it to the bleak stretches of death that lay before them , and lay behind them , and on either side . In the next street , or the one after that , there would be the door they could close , the key they could turn , and the bed that had opened wide for other lovers would open wide again for love . " Even in America there are lonely places , " she said shyly , almost in apology . Is it possible that we might be permitted to begin again ? she did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might sometime , somewhere , in another country , take all the first steps , say all the first words of love over and over ,  |p240not  just once , not just today in a hotel room , but somewhere forever ? Aloud , she said : " Sometimes I have wondered if you would like to become an American . " " Then listen , " Jaeger whispered , and he lifted her hand against his mouth . " I am whatever you are , whatever nationalitythat might be called , whatever name it could be given . " " No , no ! " she cried out . " You must not be humble ! " Her lips embraced his fingers now , saying to them : " It is I who wish to become exactly what you are . " The rain had begun to fall again , gently shedding its grey tears over the graveyard that was Kastel , falling gently on their hair , their eyes , but hope had no intention of dyingnow . There were other sections to this town , other streets to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gloom of the lobby , the open register in which he would write their names , would be suddenly there before them , startling them by its accessibility . But down the uneven path of the paving-stones , moving rapidly toward them , came now a clot of singularly abbreviated men . They did not stand upright , nor did they sit , for the torso of each had been strapped erect to a small wooden platform , homemade and mounted on castors , and on these platforms they sped forward , propelled by their knuckles , which were cushioned and bandaged with leather pads . There were four of them , with the beaked caps of the Afrika Korps worn jauntily on their heads , although the insignia , and the braid , had been deletedwith the honor a long time before . On the tan military blouse of each was a single , identical decoration : a tin mess cup that hung , empty for offerings , around each man 's neck on a knotted string . " Guten Tag ! Guten Tag ! " they called out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halt . They hooked arms instantly then , and blocked the way , and a kind of wit orp241humor passed , as tough as rope , from one to the other of them , as they waited there on their wooden mounts like dwarfs , like freaks , for some sideshow to open so that they might cash in on their eccentricities . But they were not dwarfs , for , down to the hips  --  which was all there was of them  --  they were handsomely proportioned men . Their faces were ruddy with health , their necks weathered with an old and enduring burn of wind and sun , as blazing as the desert underneath the falling rain . Their eyebrows were the color of sand under their caps , and their eyeballs , as white as porcelain , were marvelously diffused with blue . They might have been mountain guides seated at a table ; for they had the look of men who came from high glacier country , and not as if they were fragments left over from the battlefield , alive still only because of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , with no respect for woman or man , and no courtesy , in the sound of it . In a moment , they might forget there had been a war , and jump to their feet , and flick their ski-poles under their armpits , and go twisting and turning down a mountainside , their mouths roaring and yelping with their yodeling , the snow winging behind them in sails of spray . " Would the Gnadige Frau and the Herr Gemahl have a little Trinkgeld to spare ? " asked the first man on the left of the row of them , his voice mimicking the craven , the beaten , the poor . In the worn leather cushion that bound the knuckles of his hand , he held his tin cup out toward Jaeger . " Eine Kleinigkeit , " he whined . " A pfennig or two for the needy ! " puled the first man on the right of the line , his head cocked sideways to look up in sweetest mockery at the gentry standing there . " We 're collecting funds for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pious voice , aping the undefeated of Germany . " It will have to take place on foreign battlefields , "  |p242said  the first man , and he shook his head . " We 've used ours up . The scenery is falling to pieces everywhere . " " And , you know , this war , it will have to take place without me , " said one of the two men in the middle . He looked up at them as if in true regret . " Schade , and me such a patriot , " he said . But for all the comedy of these lines they spoke , still their eyes were sharp , their ears were peeled . They were watching for the audience before them to declare itself as well . " The whole bloody business will have to be undertaken ohne mich , " said this man who appeared to be older than the others , the lines carved more deeply around his mouth and between his eyebrows that were bleached to golden bushes by a sun that had shone on his flesh , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a long time before . " And ohne mich , if you can believe it , " said the first man , sighing deeply . " And , by coincidence , ohne mich , " echoed the man on the right . " Ohne mich as well , " said Jaeger , his voice modest , low . At once , the four men threw back their heads on their strong , weathered necks , and their platforms rolled this way and that . " But , look here , you 're still tall enough ! They could even make two out of you to swell the ranks ! " the first man said , and the platforms rolled on their castors , and the men laughed under the falling rain . All about them was a dying , grieving , somber world , and they as warm , as rich , as bulls or stallions , their flesh refusing the backdrop and wings of bloodless , broken stone . " Let me tell you that we could still serve , in case of need , set up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and still they laughed . When Catherine Roberts and Jaeger put money into their empty cups , the men 's blue eyes went sharp with acu/men . And now , as the castors bore them swiftly away , they began to shout a marching song aloud in furious blasphemy . " Und wir fahren , and wir fahren , and wir fahren gegen Eng-e-land ! " they sang , their voices loud , fierce , ironic . " Heute gehort uns Deutschland , morgen die gauze Welt ! " rang the echoes far in the wrecked quarries of what the city had become . When the interview with Fritzludwig was done , thought Jaeger , there would be time and to spare for love . If it was not to be allowed them in one long , sweet stretch , then pieces of it could be whittled from the end of the afternoon and the beginning of the evening , from today and tomorrow , and the days after that , from the quick minutes , the split half-hours , out of the hot nights of the unending summer that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenderest season , for which all things with blood in the veins or sap in the stalks eternally waited . The calendar stood arrested at the first bird 's call , the first blue lilac branch that flowered at the open door of spring . " I am hungry , " Catherine Roberts said as they walked , and now that they sat at a table against the wall in the Weinstube , held in the bower of the polished , high-backed seat , she said again in a low voice : " I am hungry and thirsty , Jaeger . " It was no more than a great stone cave , this Weinstube , hollowed two flights below the street . Around them in the half-dark the tables stood empty at this hour of the day . And to Jaeger their roles seemed singularly altered , for she was no longer a woman of subterfuges , girded with the national armor of American candor and American naivety . ( He had known it on men and women alike , that coat-ofmailof forthright innocence , so familiar to him now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought ofp244it . ) She had become uneasy as a child , a stranger in this place , and he must provide comfort and food , and interpret the meaning in men 's faces and their voices when she looked at him uncertainly . He was the one who talked , telling her that people came here in the evening , or after the theater at night , and that a gypsy orchestra wandered among the lamplittables then . It was as if she , who had always spoken so quickly , so easily , did not know the simple vocabulary that was required of her now . " Yes , we shall eat , " said Jaeger . There was only a middleagedwoman in an apron , her hair wrenched up in a fierce grey knot like a man 's fist laid upon her head , who moved in the room , switching on the table lamp , setting the Speisekartewearily before them , wiping the black oak of the table clean . " There is boiled hen . Do you like the sound of that ? " Jaeger said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he was speaking of other things . " Do you ever eat enough ? Do you sleep enough ? " she whispered , hesitating over the words . She could look at nothing but his face . " Now I shall eat enough , now I shall sleep enough , " Jaeger said . It was still the beginning of spring . As they waited for Fritzludwig , and waited for the food to be set before them , they held each other 's hands in silence , hearing a man 's voice in the kitchen exhorting the sad woman in her apron to jump higher , run faster , to get the carrots , the potatoes , the breast of chicken , the bread . They had begun to drink from the long-stemmed glasses when the woman returned to the table again and stood there , rocking a little , seeking gravely to keep her balance as does an unaccustomed ocean-traveler as a ship rolls out to sea . ( I have come to the end , the woman was certainly saying , although her grey lips failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the longish hairs on her upperp245lip trembling in the lamplight , her squat , manlike body reelinga little under the weight of all that life had been . You might think it would be getting better now that the prisonershave begun to come back from Russia , she might have been saying in the hush of the Weinstube , but that , too , was not without its awful depths of irony . Whether she told the story then or later , Jaeger did not know . It could have been articulated merely by her presence , and yet the date was somehow established in his mind . Her son-in-law , her daughter 's husband , had been missing since 1942 , and then last month , in the beginning of June , word came that he was on his way back with a shipment of them . Her face was as grey as granite and sober as a judge 's , but she held to the table as if the room were swinging and swaying from right to left , and looping the loop as she talked . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke . We were bombed out twice , the story went on , without any drama to it . My husband and two sons , fifteen and sixteen , killed the same night . And just last month , this other thing , as if we had n't had enough . ) She shifted her left hand to a chair now , and pulled it out , and sat down facing them . In her right hand , she still held the rag to wipe the table clean . She took the first swallowof white wine from the glass that Jaeger had put before her , and looked across the table with distant , absent eyes . " My son-in-law , he 'd never been much of a worker , " she said . " Missing ' was the right place for him to be . " She stared at the wine that lay like moonlight in her glass . " Back in 1943 , my daughter took up with somebody else , a good man , a butcher . She had to think of the children , " she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes it into his head to come home again . I tell you , I 've had more than enough of the goings-on of this life and the kind of tricks that God thinks He can play . "  |p246She  took another swallow of the wine , looking sternly from under her grey brows , even the whites of her eyes soiled and cold as iron in her face . And now the man , the chef , the proprietor , or whatever he might be , appeared in the top half of the swinging door , and he shouted out her name . " This is n't the time to sit down and start drinking again , Frau Klingelhofer ! " he shouted out . She got to her feet , leaning wearily on the table a moment before she moved away . Then she bore the tray of food back balanced on the flat of her palm , walking cautiously , the other hand outstretched to grasp the rail if the ship should wallow and fling her , reeling , from her course . On the dishes she set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrinkled skin , and carrots with broad , orange hips , and Salzkarto f f el laced with the green silk threads of leeks . There were white stalks of asparagus , bloated like the fingers of the drowned , different from the delicately seeded ferns that Jaeger had known by the same name in America , and that tasted of spring all summer there . When the woman had served them , she sat down with them again . " Every time a prisoner comes home , you know how it is , they start decorating the street where he lives , and the front of his house , " she said . " They string up flowers all over the place . So they did this for my son-in-law . " Jaeger had filled up her wineglass again , and she sat looking at the cold , misted substance he had poured , her eyes seeing the vision of her own life as they ate . The Weinstube was quiet , the knowledge of the rain gently falling outside , muting the air , closing them in . Fitzludwig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about my son-in-law coming back from Russia like that , " the woman said . " With the shortage ofp247meat there is , and the price of it , the butcher 's the best man for anybody to know . Some people were saying that my daughter could divorce her husband after a while , and marry the butcher , but for the day he came back they had to dress the whole place up for him . It 's always the custom . It had to be that way . " " Bring out the plates and the silverware , Frau Klingelhofer ! " the proprietor shouted after a while . " You leave the guests sitting there before their soiled dishes ! They want their Nachspeisen and coffee now ! " The woman rose , and began to stack the tray again , and the kitchen door swung closed . When she came back with the Strudel and coffee , she said her grandchildren could n't remember their father . The butcher was the only one they knew . And the butcher and her daughter had talked for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come into it , and the neighbors had all had advice to give , but nobody knew what to do . " All I could say was that she had a good man in the butcher , and that she had the children 's future to think of , " the woman said . With the ends of her fingers she pushed her empty glass across the table toward Jaeger , and he lifted the long-necked bottle  --  the second , this would have been  --  and poured the cold wine slowly , carefully , in . " All I could say was , " she went on saying , her face unrelentingeven now , " that here was a man coming back with nothing to offer , even his medals and citations worthless , after six years of being away . " When her daughter had gone to the station to meet the train of prisoners coming through , she 'd been crying night and day for a week . The butcher closed up shop for the afternoon and went for a walk so as not to be anywherearound when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman had dressed the grandchildren up in the best they had . For the first day he came back , she said , there was nothing else to do . " And then when the train came in , my son-in-law was n't on it , " she said . Her eyes were those of a hopelessly defeated man , asking help or pity of no one , committed to nothing now save the white wine in the glass . " They told her the train was running in sections , and maybe he 'd be on another section , and so she waited . She waited until all six sections had passed through . She was four hours at the station before the Red Cross told her he 'd died on the way , the night before , and they 'd taken the body off in Nurnberg . Tuberculosis . He 'd contracted it over there where he was . And that would have been all right , " she said , her voice and her face as cold as stone . " That would have been a way out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the station , the butcher had hung himself on a tree . That 's how it was . " She was sipping steadily at the wine now , running her tongue along the grey line of her lips . " Four women to every man in Germany , they tell you , and she lost two of them the same day . And the flowers , the decorations . " She broke off for a moment , and sat twisting the stem of the wineglass in her square , worn fingertips . " They took them down from the front of the house , and took them off the poles in the street , and they covered the butcher 's coffin with them , and they covered his grave with them . That 's the purpose they served , " she said , and she drank what was left of the wine in her glass . And now she got up from the table , for the man they had been waiting for came running rapidly , eagerly , down the stairs from the street , turning his jacket collar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He came past the empty tables , through the shadows , straight to Jaeger , his teeth and his eyeballs white in his dark-skinned , narrow face.
