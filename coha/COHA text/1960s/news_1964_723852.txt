txt London England has chosen . It pre- ; fers the Los Angeles pattern to Manhattan 's . It has been laced mescapa- ; bly with an immediate choice between building London into a megalopolis , a soaring science-fiction city of towers and tiers , or of spreading London 's growth instead out over dozens of new cities , towns , and suburbs gradually widening out ' over the farms and parklands of southeast England . The government has chosen the latter alternative . A white paper , published here in conjunction with a Ministry of Housing study of urban growth in southeast England , draws a line from the Wash , in Lincolnshire , to the solcnt. in Hampshire . Famous Names In that area it proposes three new " major cities , " two new towns , large-scale expansion of the eight existing new towns , ' and further expansion for some 17 famous and ancient towns ( such as Hastings of 1066 fame , Roman Colchester , and Banbury of the nursery rhyme ) . All these expanded urban areas of industries , office blocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern road network . The radial rail and road services into London itself will also need strengthening . For London 's own " overspill , " as the forces making centralization arc opposed and overcome , is expected ( to be between 1,000.000 and 1,250,000 people in the next 17 years . Economic Priority In the southeast as a whole , already 40 percent of the population of England and Wales ( 18 million people ) are congregated . The natural increase of the population is expected to be 3.5 million before 1981 . Added to this some further drift of people from the north and west must be anticipated . But priority in economic policy nevertheless is still to be given to the channeling of as much growth as possible from the area to other parts of the country . The southeast , however , is expanding fast on its own account . Left to itself , the expansion would probably be concentrated in and around London . Therefore , it is argued , it must not be left to itself . The biggest of the proposed counterattractions to London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested , should be in the Southampton - Portsmouth area . One is proposed for Bletchley in Buckinghamshire and one at Newbury in Berkshire .
