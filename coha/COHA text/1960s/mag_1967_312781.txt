Renewal . Urban sprawl . Relocation . High rise v. low rise . Blighted areas . Glass-box buildings . Open space . Population density . <P> For big-city newspapers , some of the most important new language and news in recent years has concerned the condition of the city itself . As billions of dollars are spent on the revitalization of dying downtowns , as crumbling old neighborhoods are bulldozed away , as the past gives way to the present , a hybrid journalist is developing-the urban reporter-critic . Reporting , he keeps citizens abreast of what 's going up and coming down , what city planners envision for the future . Criticizing , he serves as a civic conscience-denouncing the banal , calling for conservation of the historic or unique , pointing out that planners who think big sometimes err even bigger . <P> Subjects of such size often provoke pomposity , but the major critics turn out lively as well as worthy copy . <P> &gt; Allan Temko , 43 , is the hip , peppery critic for the San Francisco Chronicle . He likes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience . " I have a well-developed jugular instinct when confronted with mediocrity , " he says . In the six years he has written for the paper , he has drawn his share of blood . Almost singlehanded , he forced the Catholic Church to revise ultraconventional plans for a new cathedral ; he caused the city to change its plans for a bridge spanning south San Francisco Bay . " What a graceful , avant-garde bridge , " he says of the finished product , " and they were going to have us driving in a cage over the most beautiful bay in the world . " He once complained : " Although I am not especially eager for my daughter to marry one , some of my best friends are engineers . " Says Chronicle City Editor Abe Mellinkoff : " Temko 's stuff is just as salable as a murder in the Tenderloin . " <P> &gt; Wolf Von Eckardt , 49 , a wide-ranging critic for the Washington Post , is a self-appointed protector of Washington monuments past and to come-but he is engagingly unpredictable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features of New York 's Lincoln Center . " The camp thing to do is to call Lincoln Center middlebrow or mediocre , " he writes , " but I happen to thrill to noble proportions , a festive progression of spaces , and most of all perhaps to the kind of architecture which , like good writing , is so compelling that you do n't even notice that it is good . " Disagreeing with the editorial position of his own paper , he came out in favor of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Memorial : " Sure , it looks like granite darts . But it 's about time we have something in Washington besides Greek temples and Roman edifices-something from the mid-20th century in which we live . " Another something he has suggested , only half in jest , is the construction of floating swimming pools in the Potomac-since nobody seems anxious to clean up the polluted river .
