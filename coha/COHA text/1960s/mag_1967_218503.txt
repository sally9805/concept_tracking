Viet Cong terrorism grows ever wider in South Viet Nam . Recognizing the danger posed by the Allied pacification drive to win over and secure the rural villages of South Viet Nam , the Viet Cong are now concentrating on a campaign of terror against the country 's 35,600 pacification workers . Since January , they have killed 233 workers , wounded 320 and kidnaped another 42 . Last week alone , they killed ten pacification workers , but they were not ignoring the rest of the populace either . In the week that ended May 13 , Viet Cong terrorists murdered 85 civilians , wounded 97 and abducted 78 . <P> The reason for the Viet Cong 's campaign against pacification is a new drive being made by the Allies . Last year the pacification program was not much of a success : it managed to secure only a few hundred of South Viet Nam 's 12,000 hamlets , was crippled by severe organizational snafus . This year the Allies have launched a new effort to make the program work , as evidenced by the appointment two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pacification effort . The move will enable the U.S. to coordinate troop movements so that its forces can both fight the enemy and help give protection to the pacification workers , who perform such vital tasks as well digging and road and school construction . So seriously do the Viet Cong take the new effort that they now promise that any Communist who kills a pacification worker will be awarded the same honors as if he had killed an American soldier .
