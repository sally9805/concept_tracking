 |p579  TWO YEARS of preparation , 850 pounds of food and equipment , and I had forgotten the katas ! What could we do ? Tashi , my Tibetan companion , looked at me with disapproval . The two small ponies that the King of Mustang had sent to fetch us were waiting . Fortunately , an old monk agreed to sell me a kata , the narrow white ceremonial silk scarf required for a meeting with the king . Tucking the kata into my Tibetan robe , I mounted a pony and , with Tashi , rode out of Lo Mantang , capital of Mustang , by the town 's only gate . Passing a row of prayer flags , we galloped onto a barren plain . Two hours later , we reached the king 's summer palace . All but Surrounded by Red-held Tibet While we waited , Tashi briefed me as to how I should present the scarf , extending my right arm with " reserve and modesty .

" As it turned out , all went well , and that day , seated cross-legged at the foot of a wooden throne , I learned that Tibetan-speaking Angun Tenzing Trandul , 24th King of Mustang , did not know that the world is round . For him and his people , the world is flat and in the shape of a half-moon ! Was this more surprising , I wondered , than the fact that the outside world is ignorant of Mustang 's existence ? Hidden behind 26,810-foot Dhaulagiri , seventh highest peak in the world , and behind the great Annapurna massif , Mustang is bordered on three sides by Communistoccupied Tibet . Only 750 square miles in area , Mustang perches at a staggering mean altitude of some 15,000 Gateway to the past : Town of Tsarang marks the first stop of the author 's ten-week expedition to lofty Mustang , land of demons and lamas .

Mustang today forms an integral part of opal , but its Tibetan-Buddhist background , well as a long history of independence , give a special status within the Hindu realm . " hile Nepal administers Mustang 's foreign lations , the remote little kingdom preserves uch of its autonomy under its king , or raja , the Nepalese call him . As a matter of policy , the Nepalese Govnment has seldom permitted foreigners to ter Mustang , situated in a politically sensitive zone on Nepal 's high Himalayan border with Tibet . One of the few Westerners ever admitted to the tiny mountain state was Toni Hagen , a Swiss geologist who visited its capital in 1952. * Since 1959 , when the Communist Chinese completed their conquest of Tibet , Mustang more than ever before has been forbidden territory . At Oxford University , and with the aid of Professor Christoph von Fiirer-Haimendorf of the University of London 's School of Oriental and African Studies , I had planned a survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state . Perhaps because I spoke Tibetan , I received the first permit ever given to a foreigner to reside there at length . I owed this favor to the kindness of His Royal Highness Prince Basundhara , brother of the King of Nepal , to the sympathy of Professor Purna Harsha of the Department of Archeology and Culture of the Nepalese Government , and to the help of members of Nepal 's Foreign Office whom I first met in 1959 , when I had set out to study the Sherpas of eastern Nepal . Calm Words in Tibetan Reassure an Armed Guerrilla When permission finally came , reaching Mustang proved an adventure in itself . Two weeks after leaving Katmandu , Nepal 's capital , I found myself staring into the barrel of a submachine gun held by a fierce-looking man with long hair . I then fully understood the reluctance of the Nepalese Government to allow foreigners in this area . Not only do Chinese Communist troops flank Mustang on three sides , but often-unruly Khamba warriors ? anticommunist Tibetan refugees ? roam its southern border adjoining the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area , at best uncertain , is also decidedly unsafe . It was at the top of a high and barren pass that my party met two Khambas . One carried the machine gun , the other a rifle . " Kale phe , " I said , as calmly as possible . This phrase means , " Take it easy ? go slowly . " The two warriors were so astonished to be addressed in Tibetan that they put down their guns and let us go on . Finding servants and a companion for my journey had been a tricky problem . Bazaar opinion in Katmandu was that we would all be killed by the unruly Khambas . I finally recruited one servant , a cook named Calay who had accompanied me to the Mount Everest district in 1959 . Although I did not appreciate his specialty ? chocolate cake filled with garlic ? I knew that his bow legs were the only crooked thing about this honest young man . As for my 21-year-old Tibetan companion , Tashi , he was afraid of nothing . " In 99 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he observed cheerfully . Sooner or later made little difference to him . Personally , I preferred later . Despite the risk involved in not having a Western companion , I accepted this arrangement as the best way to get to know the people I had set out to study . For two and a half months , the duration of my trip , I spoke only Tibetan ( a dialect of it is the language of Mustang ) . I also wore a Tibetan cloak to be less conspicuous . Our expedition formed in Pokhara , near the Mustang border , in April of last year . Pokhara is the closest Nepalese town with an airstrip and a hospital . From there , with Calay , Tashi , and 10 porters , I set out for Lo Mantang ( maps , page 580 ) . Rigors of mountain life etched on her stoic face , a woman of Mustang dresses her granddaughter 's hair with yak butter .

" Long trumpets that make sounds like lowing cattle telescope for ease in carrying . Sitting cross-legged , monks and lamas sing and pray during the threeday observance in Lo Mantang . Seven days out of Pokhara , my porters refused to go any farther . Fortunately , however , I encountered four villagers from Mustang with a small herd of yaks , the long-haired cattle of Tibet . For an exorbitant price , they agreed to load my equipment and provisions and take us to their capital . Useful Yak Proves Expensive A yak is an exceedingly versatile animal . It gives wool for clothing , and the female , called a dri , gives milk to drink . Once a year yaks are bled and their dried blood is eaten . You can plow a field with a yak , ride a yak , or load it with a heavy pack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commands a high price in India as a fly whisk . And when a yak falls over a cliff , its lucky owner ( who , by law . is not allowed to kill his animal ) inherits as much as 800 pounds of meat . The yak 's only real drawbacks are its horns . its bad character , and the fact that it is incredibly slow . Added to this , yak transport in the Mustang area is incredibly expensive . Only astronomical fees will induce a herdsman to expose himself and his precious animals to the Khambas . I figured that this last part of the journey cost 84 a mile ! After 15 days of trekking over some of the worst trails in the Himalayas , and our hairraising encounter with the gun-bearing Khambas , we reached the summit of a high pass  |p587  and looked down upon the most spectacular sight I had ever seen . In a lunar landscape of deep canyons and barren ridges reared the mighty mass of a fortified town ( pages 584-5 ) . Above the walls towered red monasteries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mantang , capital of mysterious Mustang . In three directions I could look into Communist-occupied Tibet . To the south , at my back , rose the great snowy peaks of the Annapurna massif , part of the rarely seen " hidden north face " of the Himalayas . I led my small caravan down to the town . The sounds of trumpets echoed from a monastery as I walked through a massive gateway , the only breach in the great wall surrounding Lo Mantang . Townsmen close it every night to keep out brigands . For four weeks this fortress would be my home . Then I would set out to explore every corner of this strange land , visiting each of its 23 villages and two other towns . Royal Beasts Wear Silver Saddles A curious throng surrounded us as we unpacked our yaks within the town walls . One of the Lo-bas ? as the residents of Mustang call themselves ? offered us lodging . That same day I moved into the third floor of a house that belonged to the widow of a duke . Mustang houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are later  |p590  Weather-worn ruins remain where an 11thcentury fort sheltered a feudal lord and his court . Ocher-painted chortens cluster about the crumbling walls . In the background looms the seldom-photographed northern face of the Himalayas , which walls Mustang off from the rest of Nepal . Pledged to monkhood , the king 's grandson plays with a statue of Norchen Kunga Zampo , a founder of Mustang 's monasteries . removed . The rammed earth retains the grain of the wood , giving the houses the familiar appearance of molded concrete structures of the West . The king , at his summer palace at Trenkar , had been informed of my coming by a royal messenger who had run with the news from Tsarang , the first Mustang town we had entered ( pages 578-9 ) . It was now , with our arrival in the capital , that he sent two Tibetan ponies with silver saddles and elaborate harnesses to take me and Tashi to the palace for an interview ? and I had to buy a kata for the occasion . In the dimly lit throne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some dressed in rough sheepskins , others in fine silk brocade . This was the court ? servants and wealthy nobles 590 who spend most of their day attending the king or deliberating affairs of the small state . To one side , seated cross-legged on a sheepskin rug set upon a wooden throne ornamented with red and gold painted dragons , sat King Angun Tenzing Trandul ? a solemn man of about 65 years ( page 580 ) . He wore his long hair in the Tibetan manner , braided and wound tight around his head and held in place by a bright red ribbon . A dark red cloak draped his shoulders . King and Visitor Wait for First Words Silence fell on the assembly as I entered . Pulling out my kata , I bowed deeply before the king , presenting the scarf with a gesture that I hoped reflected " reserve and modesty . " The old man smiled and , not saying a word , indicated an orange-carpeted cushion by his side . I took my seat .  |p591  A long , embarrassed silence followed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this court , at which I was one of the first V-esterners ever to be received . For five long minutes I sat nervously in dead silence . The king and his attendants just stared at me . I returned the stares , marveling at everything around me . Half a dozen dogs roamed the throne room , chickens popped in and out the door , a dove cooed in a cage at the king 's foot , while ornate silver teacups lined low tables ? a startling combination of wealth and primitivism . The king bent over and picked up a thinnecked silver jug , beautifully embossed . He brought the narrow neck of the jug to within a couple of feet of his face and , to my surprise , - pat into it with grace ! Having thus cleared his throat , he said simply , " Ware re ? What is it ? " " We come to pay our respects to Your Majesty , " uttered Tashi shyly . We had agreed that he should speak first , since he knew the high honorific court language of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without trying the high honorific phraseology used in addressing great monks , nobles , and royalty . " Excuse me , I am ashamed , " I said , " but I speak Tibetan like a peasant . " The king was startled , both shocked and pleased . Shocked because I had addressed him in what could be compared to vulgar slang , startled because I spoke his language at all . This , though , broke the ice . Smiling , the king asked me where I came from . " I am French , " I said . A blank expression met my answer . " I come from very , very far away , " I explained ? " from France . "  |p592  " Is France near Lhasa , " asked the king , " or the island of America ? " It was then I learned he was unaware that the earth is round . The king asked innumerable questions about me and my purpose in his land . " I came to study the history of your kingdom , and its customs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . All present nodded approval . Abruptly , the king asked me : " Will the Chinese invade Mustang ? " Taken aback , I answered , " I do not think so . " I tried to explain that I was not a government official . " I am sure the Chinese will honor their border treaty with Nepal , " I added , alluding to a 1961 agreement that reaffirmed Mustang 's inclusion within Nepal . " I and my people are afraid , " the king said . " We hear great explosions from Tibet that bring the hills crashing down . " I later learned that the lights of a Chinese army camp could be seen from the hills of Mustang . Some of the Lo-bas had also seen " giant rumbling monsters " ? trucks ? just beyond the border . The king may not know that the world is round , but he is well aware ofte that his land may be thrown into today 's war political conflicts in Asia . rem As our audience neared its end , the king T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coming forward , the man touched his knees , Bud then the ground , and finally prostrated him- pair self before the king . Then he seated himself the at the foot of the throne . Taking a pointed Fl stick and a flask of black ink from the fold of that his coat , he began to write on a large piece of Amy handmade brown paper as the king dictated : the " I request that these two foreigners Tashi ? er and I , who are one person , should be allowed Ang assistance and their questions answered in king every monastery of my realm . " the The king , with a silver signet , affixed his Itt seal to the bottom of the page . He then point- ? m ed to a man in his mid-thirties , seated opposite the g me , and said , " This is my son .

Despite the Buddhist ban against taking life , these upland predators may be killed in self-defense or to protect livestock . Otherwise the Mustangese ? except for one lowly tribe , the Shemba ? strictly abstain from killing animals . This leopard 's skin measured nine feet from nose to tip of long tail . Fingers pointing at the sky , chortens echo the uplift of Mustang 's mountains . The Buddhist monuments rise nearly everywhere ? on lonely peaks , along secluded trails , at entrances to villages and towns , and on corners of houses . A wayfarer gains religious merit by passing the shrines on his right ; through long usage , even horses and yaks follow the custom . Each year , the chortens get fresh stripes of paint made from colored clays .  |p593  ten afflicts Tibetans who journey to lower , warmer lands . I gave him a common stomach remedy and momentarily forgot his case . The old king , I learned , had been out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great B ? . uidhist shrines . He had brought back the pa:r of horn-rimmed spectacles that struck tie only oddly modern note of his attire . From the king , and later research , I learned that Mustang was founded in the 1380 's by Ama Pal , a fierce soldier who had conquered e 20 great fortresses whose mighty ruins overlook the present villages of Mustang . Angun Tenzing Trandul claims to be the 23d king in line since Ama Pal , and he is one of the last remaining kings of a pure Tibetan culture . In Tibet itself the ancient small kingdoms were long ago united under the rule of the god-king , the Dalai Lama , who now lives -n exile in India . When China overran Tibet , Mustang was ed because a 160-year-old agreement e the King of Mustang a loose tributo the Hindu Gurkha kings of Nepal . According to this old treaty , Mustang still pays to the Nepalese authorities each year 886 Nepalese rupees ( $120 ) and one horse . In return the King of Mustang , who also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is allowed to administer his kingdom . Western Clothing Fascinates Mustangese Shortly after I settled in Lo Mantang , an old woman came up to me and pinched my arm . When I turned , I found that she and a small crowd of women were trying to learn what my clothes were made of . I soon realized that these Lo-bas were unfamiliar with the smallest of Western technological inventions . The only manufactured goods that reach Mustang are the rich gold and silk brocades imported from China across Tibet by yak caravans . These brocades furnish the monks and the rich nobles with elaborate shirts that are worn on festive occasions beneath their rough woolen sheepskin-lined cloaks . All other material for clothes is woven from the wool of the many goats that roam the high  |p594  hills . Women spin and weave goats ' wool ( pages 600-601 ) while men ? especially in the winter months ? twine yak wool into thick strands to make their knee-high boots . Wherever I went I was escorted by curious onlookers , many of whom had never before seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pans , even the texture of my tent ; grownups would fight over the empty tin cans I threw away . Matches are unknown ; everybody has his own flint and steel . Mustang , I discovered , is above all a sacred land . The very name is derived from the words sMon Thang , meaning " the plain of prayer . " Some 600 of the land 's 8,000 inhabitants are monks . The state religion is Tantric Buddhism of the Sakya-pa sect , very similar to the Buddhism of the Dalai Lama . In Mustang stand some of the most remarkable monasteries left outside Tibet ; at least two had been served in the past by as many as 1,000 monks . Three of the monasteries were cut into vertical cliffs , accessible only by ladders and tunnels hewn in the rock . Demons Haunt the Mountain Kingdom Twelve dukes , 60 monks , 152 families , and eight practicing witches sleep every night within the great sheltering walls of Lo Mantang . With the town 's only gate tightly shut , I expected that everybody would slumber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes to bed in fear . It is neither the Chinese soldiers nor the Khambas that worry the townspeople , but the 416 demons of land , sky , fire , and water . Thousands of expedients have been employed to fend off these evil spirits that cause the 1,080 known diseases as well as the five forms of violent death . Butter lamps burn before altars in the private chapel of every residence ; monks , dukes , and peasants recite prayers throughout the day ; thousands of prayer flags flutter on poles ; prayer wheels and prayer walls clutter every open space . But still the spirits prowl , especially at night . Even the intricate demon traps set on every house ( page 596 ) , and the horse 's skull secretly buried below each doorstep , can not stop them . When the sun sets behind the eternal snows to the west , no resident is truly safe . On the first day of the fourth lunar month of the Tibetan calendar ( May 10 , 1964 ) , I was awakened by the shrill sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a human leg bone ? an instrument frequently used by monks . From the flat roof of my house , I gazed down upon a ceremony unfolding in the town 5 94 square . It was to last three full days , filling the air with the chilling sound of cymbals and the morbid drone of drums , some made from human skulls . This was the annual " chasing of the demons , " usually held at the beginning of the New Year , but delayed for some reason last year ( pages 586-9 ) . The square had the appearance of a monastery . Monks sat on red carpets , and more than 60 of them assisted the High Lama of Lo Mantang , who officiated dressed in a vivid brocade gown with a hat representing two dragons and human skulls . A sturdy " policeman " monk patrolled the crowd of onlookers ; in his hand , instead of a night stick , he carried a sheaf of peacock feathers . On the third day the ceremony reached its climax . A mighty shriek ushered in three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their spells about the assembly . Suddenly , as if panic-stricken , everybody rose and rushed screaming for the town gate . Outside the walls , the lama shot a sacred arrow into a symbolic offering representing one of the evil dancers . The crowd cheered as the arrow hit its mark , and away ran one of the demon dancers . The operation was repeated with sling and stone , and another demon fled . Then 15 men with old muzzle-loading muskets fired at the third offering , and the last of the demons disappeared . Sharing a Room With a Corpse Had I died in Mustang , I could have chosen from quite a variety of funeral services . Following Tibetan Buddhist custom , I could either have been cremated , thrown into a river , buried , or I might have been chopped up into small squares and fed to the vultures . thus disappearing into thin air . In this manner the human body is believed to return to the four elements of which it is composed : fire , water , earth , and air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mustang adds a fifth method reserved for a man who dies leaving neither sons nor grandsons . His body is preserved in salt and then enclosed in the walls of his house . When finally , in the third generation or beyond , a boy is born , the dead body is taken out at night and secretly carried to a nearby hill , where the corpse is " traded " to the evil demons against a guarantee of long life to the newborn male heir . To my discomfort , I learned one day that a body lay within the walls of the private chapel in which I had been sleeping as the honored guest of a noble family in Lo Mantang.  |p595  ereafter I felt as if I were sleeping in a tomb . A week after my arrival , Pemba , a Lo-ba o had befriended me , scrambled up the ched tree-trunk ladder that led to my tere . The king 's son is very ill and is going to he panted . " People say you are respone , that you gave him medicine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You should never have given him anying , " said Tashi . " These people are simple d uneducated , not like those of Lhasa . " This did little to cheer me . I quickly took bottle of antibiotics from my medical kit . his will do the trick , I thought , while I sent ashi to hire ponies . A short time later we clattered up the stone steps that led to the king 's summer palace . As we dismounted , my heart sank . We were too late . Before the door smoldered a small yakdung fire beside three red-painted stones placed one upon the other . These meant that s Qmeone was seriously ill inside , and not even a close relative could enter . On returning to Lo Mantang , I was told that local doctors had gone the day before to e patient 's side . Their " medical " bags , I knew , would have contained dried frogs and similar ineffective delicacies . For three whole weeks the yak-dung fire as kept smoldering before the palace gate while the king 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could do but ponder the consequences should he die . Awaiting reports of the royal patient , I set out with Tashi to investigate the nearby monasteries . Frescoes covered the walls of the inner chambers of these sanctuaries ; every corner was a work of art . From the ceilings hung beautifully painted religious scrolls 1page 603 ) , while the altars bore gilt-copper statues of famous lamas and great divinities . Most striking of all was the gigantic figure of Maitreya , the " Buddha who is next to come , " standing three stories high in one of the main temples of Lo Mantang . Seated cross-legged in the dimly lit sanctuaries of these monasteries , Tashi and I pored over the many books stored there in pigeonhole racks . With a great thud , large silk-bound volumes , some weighing as much as 50 pounds , were dumped before us by the monks to whom we showed our royal letter of introduction . Tashi proved invaluable in translating the intricate Tibetan literary language ; it differs from both colloquial Tibetan ? which alone had taken me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some books were very old and plain . Others  |p598  had silver covers inlaid with thick gold characters . One day we were lucky enough to stumble onto a manuscript of the history of Mustang from the 1380 's to the present day . This unique manuscript proved that the small mountain state boasts a long and continuous history . In the past , Mustang had apparently been a relatively rich kingdom . The ruins of abandoned towns and monasteries support the written evidence . Mustang had also played a significant political role in the past , particularly after the Tibetan-Nepalese war of the 1850 's when , for his services in the peace negotiations , the king had been granted three peacock feathers ? one from the Manchu Emperor of China , one from the Nepalese Maharaja , and one from the Dalai Lama . The king still wears three feathers in his largebrimmed ceremonial hat . So high and barren is this land that not a single tree grows wild on its wind-swept hills . The kingdom 's few trees grow only near streams or in irrigated gardens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure of royalty and the lords of the land . At first I was amazed that humans could survive in such high and desolate terrain . The Lo-bas manage to live only through their ingenuity and trade . Elaborate irrigation canals bring water from deep mountain gorges to @# the villages . Surrounded by green fields of barley and buckwheat , these villages resemble oases on the moon . The Lo-bas ' frugal diet centers upon ground barley , complemented by yak 's milk and cheese . Nevertheless , only the salt trade between Tibet and Nepal enables Mustang to survive . The Lo-bas fetch the salt from Chinese-held Tibet , loaded on yaks , goats , or ponies . They transport this precious merchandise over the mountains to Nepal , where they trade it for grain and silver coins . One day , a salt trader told me : " The Chinese know everything that you are doing . " Having nothing to hide , I did not care . But out of curiosity I asked , " How do you know ? " " I told them , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the barren canyons of Mustang lies hidden wealth ? gold .

Contrary to my ) prehension , I was well received . The king adily answered all my questions . While we sat talking , a servant filled my cup again and again with Tibetan tea . Made of rough leaves and brewed with an equal weight of butter and salt , Tibetan tea is really a kind of soup . My royal host even had a raw egg put into the tea to please me . Attempting to smile with approval , I kept gulping the strange liquid from my never-empty cup . Everybody Works for the King The king , I found out , is not alone in administering his domain . Dukes and district lords assist in the task . Every family in Mustang has a particular duty to perform . Some peasants operate the royal messenger service , standing at the king 's disposal to carry letters and his belongings from town to town . Others must provide their king with fuel ; still others must maintain his household .

Trees ( right background ) grow at this altitude only near water and in gardens .  |p601  In many respects Mustang resembles a small feudal state of medieval Europe , though in Mustang possibly more people know how to read and write . Children are taught at home or in monasteries . If a family has two sons , at least one enters religious orders when he is eight or nine years old . This was the case with the king 's second son , now living secluded in a great monastery in the town of Tsarang . Although a monk , he had disregarded his vows of celibacy and had married . A year before my arrival his wife had died . To atone for his impious youth and to gain merit , he had voluntarily confined himself to a room above the monastery to pass three full years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Name Foils Demons The young lama received me ? as a Westerner I was a curiosity throughout the kingdom ? and even invited me to share his seclusion . We passed many hours seated together before the elaborate altar in his cell . There he gave me a new name . Hundreds of butter lamps flickered before the pensive faces of gilt statues . The lama recited prayers for a whole day ; then , after a night of meditation , he gave me a folded piece of paper . Written on this was my new name . These given names are often kept secret ; had I wanted to do so , I could have hidden the paper in a small bag to be carried around my neck . When I died , the monk performing one of my funeral rites would open the secret bag , look at the name , mutter it in his prayers , and then burn the paper . No demon would learn my identity .

One day I strode into a village to find all the men sitting in a field . Some drank chang ? barley beer ? in silver cups ; some twined yak wool ; others turned prayer wheels . I inquired what was going on . To my surprise I learned that this was a local court of justice , its members in calm deliberation . Crimes and offenses in Mustang go either I , - fore a village court , supervised by an electe " wise man , " or before the king . With wry humor , the populace knows the king 's court as " the golden yoke , " since both parties to a dispute usually end by payinz heavy fines to the king .

" I never had the courage to tell him that in France we even eat snails , frogs , and sometimes horse meat . Lo-bas avoid the killing of all animals , even rescuing flies when they fall into a cup of tea , and fleas are carefully plucked and thrown away alive . Buddhists consider killing as evil , because they regard animals as low reincarnations of human beings .
