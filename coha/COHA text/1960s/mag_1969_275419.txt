Los Angeles , one of the most auto-clogged cities in the world , is trying a new solution for its traffic trauma : a portable parking lot . The product of a local firm called Portable Parking Structures , Inc. , the lot is actually a three-level open garage that looks as if it were built with an oversize Erector set . The structure is bolted together from steel beams and prefab concrete slabs . It can be assembled quickly on temporarily unused downtown lots and dismantled within one week when the land must be vacated to make way for a new building . <P> The recently opened portable at the Los Angeles Civic Center accommodates up to 1,236 cars , and Portable Parking has contracts to build similar structures in San Francisco , St. Louis and Kansas City , Mo . J. J. Dreyfuss , the general manager , estimates that the firm will gross $7 , 000,000 this year . <P> The portable parking lots can be built in half as much time and for one-third to one-half as much money as conventional poured-concrete structures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their appearance- which is most charitably described as functional-does not do much to improve the esthetics of a neighborhood . But what parking lot does ?
