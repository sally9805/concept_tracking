In the courtyards of the Czech and Soviet embassies in Lopoldville , documents burned by night , and workers nailed covers on big wooden crates . In the Red Chinese mission , clothes were hastily crammed into suitcases . Then Communism 's Congo corps of diplomats , " technicians " and correspondents rolled in melancholy procession to the Leopoldville airport and there boarded Ilyushins for home , expelled on orders from the Congo 's latest government . Snapped one Russian diplomat : " We 'll be back . " But at least for the moment , the Russians ' chief ally in the Congo , demagogic Premier Patrice Lumumba , had lost his grip on power-and with him had crumbled the Russians ' promising foothold . <P> Unlikely Strongman . The Congo 's newest emergent leader is Joseph Dsir Mobutu , a 29-year-old lieutenant colonel whom even most Congolese had never heard of until he announced his military coup at midweek . " We are bringing a truce to politics until the end of the year , " he declared . " During this revolutionary period , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> Constitutionally , the Congo was a worse shambles than ever . There were now three governments instead of two-Mobutu 's , Lumumba 's and moderate President Joseph Kasavubu 's . But in the 3,000-man Lopoldville garrison of the Congolese army , Mobutu had at least temporarily enough firepower to make his orders stick . This was a detail that both Lumumba and Kasavubu had overlooked . Both had always been happy when they could line up enough loyal soldiers to form a personal honor guard . <P> Forlorn Forays . The week began with comic-opera flourishes . First , Lumumba rounded up two truckloads of soldiers and roared off to Radio Congo in the apparent belief that with a microphone in his hand he could conquer the world . But the United Nations had closed the station to inflammatory broadcasts , and Ghanaian soldiers guarded it with fixed bayonets . " If you try to use force , " warned the lieutenant in charge , " I 'll have to shoot . " Then he turned to Lumumba 's trusted aide , General Victor Lundula , and added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " General Lundula advised retreat . <P> President Kasavubu 's counter-interventions were no more effective . Rallying a small troop of loyal soldiers , he sent them off to capture his rival Lumumba . The troop took Lumumba by surprise , bundled him into his own official black Ford and drove him off to a prison cell at Camp Leopold II . But less than two hours later , General Lundula convinced the guards that he had orders to transfer Lumumba to another prison . Once beyond the gates , Lumumba located 40 friendly soldiers and rolled back downtown , with sirens screaming , shouting . " Today victory is mine . Death to the imperialists ! " Once again he headed for Radio Congo . Once again his path was barred , this time by Ghana 's proper , British-trained Lieut . Colonel Nathan Aferi . Roared Lumumba in impotent rage : " Let me pass , you black , imperialist bushman ! "
