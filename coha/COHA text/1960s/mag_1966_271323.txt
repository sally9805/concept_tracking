<P> " The self-evidence of ecumenical relations between the churches is now a fact . The World Council has shattered the isolation of the churches . " So last week did Dr. Willem Visser ' t Hooft sum up the change in ecclesiastical attitudes during the 18 years he has served as general secretary of the World Council of Churches . <P> Visser ' t Hooft delivered his valedictory as he prepared to turn over the duties and prerogatives of his office to the Rev. Eugene Carson Blake , 60 , the strong-willed U.S. Presbyterian who has been preparing for his new job by studying French at the University of Grenoble . Visser ' t Hooft , 66 , will remain as a consultant , writing his memoirs on the unity movement , which he says he will " try to make a little more readable than most of the literature on the subject . " <P> Committed Churches . Under Visser ' t Hooft 's patient , paternal direction , the World Council has grown from a dream of committed individuals to a reality of committed churches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a worldwide brotherhood of 217 Christian churches representing every Christian view but that of Rome . And thanks to the continuing dialogue with the Vatican that Visser ' t Hooft has carefully fostered , even Roman Catholic participation in the council is no longer beyond hope . <P> To Visser ' t Hooft , one major change in ecclesiastical outlook created by the World Council is that Protestants no longer justify their disunity by saying that they all nonetheless belong to the " invisible church " - the concept of a band of Christian brothers united by baptism and faith but no outward ties . Today , he says , " all churches are aware that a unity that can not be grasped is just as unbiblical as a faith that is kept hidden . It has now also become impossible to believe that the Western-European type of Christendom is the definite and normative form of Christian life and faith . We have learned that no member can pretend to be the entire body . " <P> Too Many Officers . Visser ' t Hooft concedes that much remains to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says , " full community of the great confessions still does not exist . The churches have spent years in dialogue , but only very few have taken the big plunge toward union . " One reason for this has been the realization that " there can be no unity until there has been sweeping church renewal " - and traditional structures are " so tough and unbending that renewal often gets stuck halfway . " Still another roadblock to progress is that " the ecumenical message has not yet penetrated to grassroots level in the parishes . We have too many officers and not enough soldiers . " <P> Impatient at the slow pace of progress in unity , plenty of young Protestant thinkers , including some on the World Council 's staff in Geneva , have wondered whether ecumenism is possible within the framework of existing churches . Visser ' t Hooft understands the impatience , but remains convinced that to abandon the church as institution is to abandon the hope of unity for good . " An ecumenical movement not rooted in the churches would just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he insists . " We must forget about the notion that others will do the job of unity for us. "
