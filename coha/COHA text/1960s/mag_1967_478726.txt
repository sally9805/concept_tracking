Mounting campaign costs and unrealistic regulations are having ominous effects on American political life . A seven-term Congressman suggests what should he done . No facet of American life cries out more loudly for reform than the dingy gray area of political campaign financing , which casts a lengthening shadow across all else we do in our elective public institutions . As a veteran of seven successful campaigns for the U. S. House of Representatives and one losing race for the Senate , I 've experienced at first hand the skyrocketing cost of politics . It is now , in fact , nearly impossible in most states for men of modest means to seek high elective office ? unless they are willing wards of the wealthy . The price of campaigning has risen so high that it actually imperils the integrity of our political institutions . Big contributors more and more hold the keys to the gates of public service . This is choking off the wellsprings of fresh , new thought and severely limiting the field of choice available to the public . I am convinced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deteriorating as a result . One curious by-product of big money in politics is the slick , shallow public-relations approach with its nauseating emphasis on " image " at Harper 's Magazine , April 1967 the expense of substance . In the arenas where Lincoln and Douglas once debated great issues , advertising agencies last year hawked candidates like soap flakes . Nineteen sixty-six was the year of the political singing commercial ; easily seven or eight times as much money was spent on 20-second or 50-second spots on TV as on programs permitting any serious discussion of issues . Candidates hired professional pollsters to sample the electorate and offer advice on the most effective color combinations , lettering styles , and photographic poses . The whole business was taking on a patently phony , make-believe veneer . This situation will not change unless Congress enacts a meaningful body of law to reform the antiquated and unenforceable regulations that are evaded by almost every candidate and ridiculed by the public . In the past decade eighteen different proposals designed to do this have been introduced in Congress . Not one has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall under the purview of an ancient statute known as the Corrupt Practices Act of 1925 . This law must have had some meaning in its day . But in 1966 it was about as effective as stuffing popcorn into the mouth of a running fire hose . The law stipulates among other things that a candidate for the House may spend no more than $5,000 in his bid for election , and a candidate for the Senate no more than $25,000 . If I told you I had never spent more than $5,000 in a House race , I 'd be a hypocrite . And if I actually had spent so little in my first race , I 'd never have been elected . The same applies to at least 95 per cent of my colleagues . The huge loophole in the law lies in the fact that a candidate need not report the funds collected and spent in his behalf by a committee . The transparent fiction is that this goes on without his knowledge . No candidate has ever been prosecuted for noncompliance with the Corrupt Practices Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a $10,000 fine for willful violation ) . In times past , revelations of flagrant overspending or unsavory contributions evoked shock and public censure . Put today our very capacity for indignation seems to have withered . We take huge expenditures for granted . In the New York Senate race of 1964 , for example , winner Robert F. KenJim Wright has represented Fort Worth , Texas , in the House of Representatives since 1955 . He is the author of two books , You and Your Congressman " and " The Coming Water Famine . " Next month " Harper 's " regular Washington Correspondent , Clayton Fritchey , will return to these columns . ously unworkable and commonly disobeyed ordinance . But what excuse can there be for us who have it directly in our hands to change the law ? It is our very profession to make the law , and to make it mean something ? if , in fact , we want it to mean something ! By refusing either to abide by it or to change it , we present a sad spectacle indeed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wants both to obey the law and tell the truth . Last summer John J. Hooker , Jr. , a Nashville attorney who unsuccessfully sought the Tennessee gubernatorial nomination , promised during his campaign to make a complete public report on his expenditures . He fulfilled the pledge on September 4 , showing total spending of $591,296.27 . Political pros in Tennessee were shocked , Certainly it was n't the first time there had been expenditures in this range ; but it was the first time such a public disclosure had been made in the history of the state . hooker could hardly have affronted tradition more flagrantly had he denounced old folks or come out in favor of General William Tecumseh Sherman . The legal limit for a statewide primary race in Tennessee is $25,000 . Hooker may have rendered himself subject to prosecution , though it is doubtful that one would be pressed . His successful opponent , Buford Ellington , played it safe and traditional . He filed a solemn declaration just a whisker under the legal limit ? $24 , - 809.12 . A similar figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor Frank Clement 's winning race for the Senate nomination ? $24,089.22 . Ellington , questioned by newsmen , conceded that , of course , it costs a lot more than $25,000 to run such a race . But he maintained that a candidate was complying with the law if he did riot " personally know " of the various expenditures in his behalf . ( His own report . made no reference to funds devoted to advertising , the inference being that the candidate had traveled throughout his slate blind to billboards , car stickers , and newspaper ads , and deaf to his own radio and TV commercials . ) Ellington should not , however , be singled out fur censure . Pretending not to know of expenditures in one 's behalf is an accepted practice . When lawmakers generally flout the law , democracy is in peril . But still greater evils result when lawmakers are subjected to mounting financial pressures . Just last year a Senate committee examined the ethics of Senator Tom Dodd of Connecticut , who paid off his campaign debts with the proceeds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Vice President ( Lyndon Johnson for the first two , Hubert Humphrey for the third ) . More than two thousand of Senator Dodd 's constituents bought tickets to one or more of these gala affairs , which jointly netted over $100,000 . For a public official , debt is debilitating , It can plague his conscience and divide his energies . It can sorely test his integrity , or sap his courage at the very time he needs it most . Ultimately , if he remains single-minded in his devotion to the public weal and keeps his back resolutely turned upon temptation , debt can drive him , despairing , nut of public life . Sometimes its shadow hovers over him for years afterwards . I know this at first hand . In 1961 , I made an unsuccessful race in a special election for the U. S. Senate . After it was over , we figured that we had spent some $270,000 . Obviously , it had n't been enough . But I ended up owing $68,000 , mostly for debts which I had not personally authorized . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the notes . Consider the ease of Democrat Leonard Wolf of Iowa , who served one term in the House . He came to Congress in January 1959 owing $89,000 in campaign debts and business losses incurred while campaigning . He was defeated in 1960 when Nixon carried Iowa for the Republicans . Today , six years after leaving office , Wolf has finally paid off most of the $89,000 . When friends urged him to run again in 1966 , he understandably said , " No , thanks . " But even this financial disaster seems minor compared with the experience of James E. Turman who conducted an unavailing campaign for Lieutenant Governor of Texas in 1962 . He came close , made the runoff , but lost in the second primary . For almost five years , he has been making regular monthly payments from his personal income to retire his campaign debt . And he calculates that , on this schedule , he will not be in the clear until 1981 . It will take nineteen years to pay for one near-miss at the polls ! Perhaps you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's his tough luck . A fellow who ca n't afford it should n't take on a campaign of that kind . " And perhaps you 'd be right . But where does that leave any able young American who genuinely wants to contribute his time and talent to the political life of his country ? Unless he has inherited spectacular wealth , it leaves him at the mercy of large contributors , who will expect him in one way or another to serve their interests . Ten Million Hands to Shake So far as my own case gees , I 've been luckier than most politicians . When I made my first run for Congress I had enough money of my own to pick up the tab personally for half ( about $8,000 ) of the campaign cost . Since the beginning , I 've made it an unvarying rule never to accept more than a $100 contribution from any individual . The average over the years has been around $10 . This preserves my independence from personal obligation . I would n't want it otherwise . A Congressman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I am ? in having a very understanding constituency . But this formula is impossible for a statewide contest , as I discovered in my 1961 try for the Senate . In that race , two balloons of fantasy exploded in my face . The first was the notion that if I announced my candidacy early , 1 would frighten off other prospective aspirants . Instead , seventy-one would-be candidates threw their hats in the ring , creating the biggest field of entries in the history of Texas politics . If this raised some doubts as to my ability to intimidate opposition , I argue that it should have established me as a leader of men , since never before had so many followed the example of one . My second and more serious fallacy was the assumption that a determined man in good health could make up by prodigious personal effort what he lacked in finances , 1 would simply WASHINGTON INSIGHT campaign harder than anyone else in the race . In the ensuing four months , I traveled 27,000 miles , made 678 speeches , slept an average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During one week , I averaged eleven speeches a day in as many different localities . But it was like trying to siphon off the Gulf of Mexico with an eyedropper . For there were then ten million people in Texas ; if I worked sixteen hours a day and wasted no time , it would have taken Ins some twenty-eight years to talk for one minute with every citizen in the state . I had four months . The upshot was that I came close , but not close enough . Out of the seventy-two entries , I barely missed second spot which would have put me in the runoff , with John Tower , the sole Republican . Tower subsequently won over airline executive Bill Blakley who had nosed me out of the number two position . Each of these two men had spent on billboard , newspaper , and radio advertising at least three times the amount I 'd been able to put together . I planned to make the race again in 196G when Senator Tower would be up for reelection . But , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large . I could not bring myself to initiate alliances with those who could provide the wherewithal in big chunks . This is , alas , the accepted way in Texas , and probably in most states . Nor , with a son in college and two daughters almost ready to enter , could I mortgage their futures on another underfinanced race which might leave me owing $100,000 or more and out of a job . In a last-ditch effort to find a broad base of campaign financing I bought $10.000 worth of television time for one statewide broadcast . I told the audience exactly what it costs to run a statewide campaign in Texas , and said that I would become a candidate for the Senate if 25,000 individual Texans who agreed with any views would participate to the extent of contributing $10 each . The response was good . I received nearly seven thousand letters ? a bona fide expression of grass-roots support . But contributions and precise pledges totaled only $48,828.50 ? far less than the $250,000 I had considered a minimum base . I am convinced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obtain it I would have had either to make a beggar of myself in repeated telecasts , or to meet privately with affluent individuals and organized groups to discuss what I could do for them primarily rather than for the United States . I 'm not temperamentally suited for the former role nor conscientiously fitted for the latter . So there was nothing to do but return the generous contributions and forget about running for the Senate . Martinis and Lobbyists My experience is no great tragedy for America . But when the same thing happens all over the country , then the consequences are ominous . Senator Dodd 's testimonial dinners were at least supported by his own constituents . This is not true of the now-familiar Washington cocktail party which is financed by lobbyists . The Congressional friends of the honoree are generally importuned to attend these gatherings ( on free ducats ) , while blocks of tickets ? ranging in price from $50 to $1.000 ? are bought by various lobbyists . Everybody stands around nibbling hors d'oeuvres and sipping martinis until a whistle blows and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His campaign fund receives the proceeds . One trade-association executive was invited ? in an eighteen-month period ? to seventy such receptions . Another money-raising gimmick , employed by the national party headquarters , is the fancy brochure with ads selling for $10,000 to $15,000 a page . The Democrats ' latest . book is called " Toward an Age of Greatness " ; the Republicans ' is titled " Congress ? The Heartbeat of Government . " Eleven of the nation 's top twenty-five defense contractors have bought ads in brochures of this kind and they 've deducted the price from their taxes as a " business expense . " Many advertisers have been corporations , legally prohibited from contributing to campaigns . But the proceeds go to the national campaign committees which divide them among various Congressional candidates . Other advertisers include companies whose activities are directly regulated by the government , including eix air-lines ( American , Braniff , Continental , Eastern , Pan American , and TWA ) ; three railroads ? the Milwaukee Road , Southern Railway System , and Union Pacific ; the Tennessee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone believe that these companies ? and others throughout the country who more quietly slip multi-thousand-dollar contributions into the individual campaign coffers of their favored candidates ? expect no selfish return ? A more subtle lure , for Presidential campaign money , is the chance to visit socially with the President at party functions by joining the President 's Club at annual dues of $1,000 . Recently , plans were said to be under way to create an " elite " President 's Club , with dues of $10,000 , the additional bonus being an invitation to the White House . I find it embarrassing that any President should have to engage in such maneuvers . And I deplore the legal vacuum that makes them necessary , Broadening the Base President Johnson in his draft bill last year asked Congress to require that every gift and every expenditure of $100 and more , whether taken or spent by the candidate himself ur by one of his " committees , " be publicly reported . He also proposed that $5,000 be established as the absolute maximum which any one individual or interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my view , $5,000 is still too much ; I think the figure should be reduced to around $1,000 . ) The President 's main recommendation was that political contributions of up to $100 be deductible in computing one 's income taxes , as are philanthropic gifts . I would like to go even further : I think we should offer a tax credit ? deductible from the tax itself rather than from reportable income ? of contributions up to $25 . This is the indispensable key to any really workable reform . Average Americans , with no axe to grind except good government , must he induced to take up the slack if we are to free American politics from its disgraceful dependence upon the little handful of blue-chip contributors . To be effective , individual tax deductions and ceilings on individual contributions should be coupled with WASHINGTON INSIGHT a practical and legally enforceable upper limit on allowable expenditures . Surely there should be some limit ? high enough to permit each side an adequate campaign of public enlightenment but low enough to take politics out of the commercial marketplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office is up for sale to the highest bidder . I introduced in the 89th Congress and again this year a bill which would limit expenditures for House candidates to not more than $30,000 for a party primary and an additional $30 , - 000 for a general election . ( The two figures add up to precisely the amount of a Congressman 's salary for a two-year term . I For Senatorial races my bill proposes a ceiling related to the population of the state . It would be calculated by multiplying $30,000 by the number of Congressmen from that state . In Texas . for example , with twenty-three members of the House , a Senate candidate could spend up to $690,000 for a primary and the same amount for a general election . In New Hampshire or New Mexico , with two House seats each , the ceiling would be $60,000 . For Maryland , it would be $240.000 ; in New York and California . a little more than a million dollars . With all parties and all contestants honoring the same law , this would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be allowed for Presidential campaigns . The present unrealistic law purports to limit a party committee to raising and spending no more than $3 million a year . However , in 1964 , the two major parties reported expenditures of S29 million . Nobody knows how much more went unreported . In the closing weeks of the 89th Congress , concern over the enormous cost of Presidential campaigns resulted in a legislative surprise ? a special amendment to the " Christmas Tree " tax bill . The new law provides that any taxpayer , by simply placing a cheek mark in a box which will appear on future income-tax forms , may authorize $1.00 of his taxes to be placed in a Presidential Campaign Fund . He will not be able , however , to direct which party gets his dollar . Proceeds will be divided equally between the major parties .
