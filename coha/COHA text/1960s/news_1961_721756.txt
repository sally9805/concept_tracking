txt ALBANY , March 26 ? Governor Rockefeller flew to Puerto Rico today for a week 's vacation , leaving his desk piled high with the accomplishments and burdens of the 1961 legislative session . While some of the bills approved by the Legislature during its closing days were actually awaiting action in the A summary of 1961 session will be found on Page 16 . Governor 's office , many hundreds of others were still being processed by the Senate and Assembly staffs . It was not until.evening that an accurate count of the bills left for the Governor could be ' obtained . All told , the 1961 session passed 1,293 bills  --  ninetysix fewer than last year ? of which Mr ; Rockefeller has already acted on 197 , leaving // 1,096 to be signed or vetoed before midnight of April 24 . Despite the formal close of the session , at least two major legislative issues were left unresolved . These were : Will the state be able to build the 828,000,000 Lincoln Center theatre for operetta and ballet for which one enabling bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key higher education bill that would authorize the State University to acquire the University of Buffalo die in the Assembly Rules Committee ? The problem involved in the Lincoln Center theatre is a legal one . Governor Rockefeller 's aides insist that the bill that cleared both houses provides sufficient authorization for construction of the project . Other authorities , however , are of the opinion that a second bill providing for acquisition of the land is essential . That measure was not passed because the New York City Council refused to approve a required resolution requesting it , reportedly because the Legislature had not proved cooperative about creating new judgeships for the city . The bill on the University of Buffalo provided one of the fillips of excitement and political intrigue in an otherwise rather dreary and routine closing . The sidetracking ' of the bill , first denied but established today , was important primarily because it had been the top personal project of Senator Walter J. Mahoney , the powerful Republican leader of the upper house . The fact that a bill so strongly backed by Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house led to immediate speculation that the action had ' been a deliberate snub or demonstration of personal power by Speaker Joseph F. Carlin of the Assembly , who heads the Rules Committee there . This interpretation appeared highly unlikely today . The bill to help the State University take over the private institution , a $4,500,000 initial investment , had been agreed upon by the Republican leaders and the Governor long ago . Moreover it was doubtful if the failure of the bill to pass would actually delay the program . Money for the purpose is provided in the new budget , and the legislative leaders could clear the negotiations by signing a certificate of intent , pledging approval of the measure next year . Actually there will undoubtedly be an earlier opportunity to correct Ole oversight . The Legislature plans to convene for a special session sometime next fall to reapportion the state 's b Conaressional districts . When the political tally sheets were added up today , the general concensus was that - Governor Rockefeller had enjoyed a successful session , although one not marked by any venturesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session ended with several of Mr. Rockefeller 's key programs going down to defeat . The Governor avoided this fate this year by two methods  --  failing to renew his most controversial proposals and winning support from Senator Mahoney for some others . This year , in part by backing an income tax rebate , the Governor . was able to win Mr. Mahoney over to the nonresident income tax bill that died in the Senate last year . Also , by making a minor concession , Mr. Rockefeller reversed the Senate majority leader 's opposition to his housing discrimination . bill . The programs Mr. Rockefeller jettisoned this year rather than risk more defeats were his fallout shelter plan and a proposal for new nonproperty taxing powers for large federated school districts . The session was also notable for a successful revolt against the Republican leadership and the Governor by upstate Republican Assemblymen . Showing rare unanimity , they forced revision , of the education aid bill to produce more money for the rural counties .               @ @ @ @ @ @
