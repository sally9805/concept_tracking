Austria also has some economic difficulties with Communism-but of a quite different character . At the time of the 1955 Austrian State Treaty , it was assigned to the political limbo of everlasting neutrality between East and West . Russia has used the treaty to object to Austria 's moves to join Western Europe 's Common Market , on which it depends for most of its trade .
