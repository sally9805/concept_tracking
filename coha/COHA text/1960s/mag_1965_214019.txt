Congressman Jimmy Roosevelt wants to be mayor of Los Angeles-and in his campaign for election in the municipal primary on April 6 , he is giving almost as good as he gets from Incumbent Sam Yorty , one of the least rascible men in U.S. political life . A sample Roosevelt-Yorty exchange last week : <P> Roosevelt : I have charged the present administration with government by tantrum because , among other reasons , its actions and decisions , affecting every citizen of our city , often seem to be arrived at on the spur of the moment and with the taint of political expediency . It is as if the mayor of the moment , after four years of junketing and bickering , has finally realized he needs to present a record to the voters . <P> Yorty : He has come to the end of the line in Washington . And maybe he thinks he will change his luck back here . But you know , he has a carpetbag filled with empty promises . <P> Los Angeles ' mayoralty elections are nonpartisan , and while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 55 , is a conservative Democrat , ideology is not playing much of a part in their campaign . Rather , the race is more an extension of the longstanding feud between Democratic Governor Pat Brown and Democratic Assembly Speaker Jesse Unruh . Roosevelt has charged that there is a " sinister alliance between the political machines of Big Daddy Unruh and Little Daddy Yorty " which " must be stopped and not allowed to take over city government , lock , stock and barrel . " Yorty accuses Brown of helping Roosevelt . Brown denies it-sort of . " I have said time and time again that I intend to remain neutral in the race for mayor of Los Angeles , " he says . " But I might add that Yorty is making it awfully difficult for me to do it . " The Governor saves most of his critical energies for Unruh . Said he recently : " I have tried time and again to go along with that s.o.b. , but things keep getting worse . " <P> Roosevelt 's name has brought the city 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter that , Yorty recently embarked on a whirlwind courtship of Los Angeles ' minority groups . In the space of five days , he lunched with the Independent Orthodox Rabbis , had cocktails with leaders of the city 's Mexican community , dined with the local Chamber of Commerce in Chinatown , introduced Martin Luther King Jr . at a World Affairs Council luncheon , attended a reception of Hungarian community leaders , and planned to appear at a dinner honoring Cardinal Mclntyre.
