To those who suffer from gephyrophobia - fear of bridges - the alumi num-painted , 2,235-ft. span between Kanauga , Ohio , and Point Pleasant , W. <P> Va. , was a constant horror . Christened in 1928 as the " Gateway to the South , " it swayed sickeningly to every vagrant breeze - so much so that Point Pleas ant Mayor D. B. Morgan banned its use during parades . Last week , under the bumper-to-bumper weight of cars , gravel trucks , and semitrailers , the " Silver Bridge " collapsed , carrying perhaps as many as 100 people to their deaths in the murky , near-freezing Ohio River waters 80 ft. below . <P> <P> The first break in the bridge 's 2-in. by 12-in . Ibar suspension cables apparently came-at ten minutes to 5 p.m. - on the upriver , Ohio side . To Dick Kuhn , 18 , a gas-station attendant , it sounded like a shotgun volley : " I thought some nuts were dusting ducks under the bridge . " Then the upstream side of the roadway tilted in surreal slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dusk and an estimated 60 vehicles onto the weedgrown riverbank and into the 6-m.p.h. current beneath . " It looked like a snake wiggling across the water , " one witness exclaimed . Said another : " The bridge just keeled over , starting slowly on the Ohio side and then folding like a deck of cards to the West Virginia side . " <P> Floating Cars . Spearlike steel girders cascaded into the shattered trucks and cars , pinning people against the bank and the riverbed . Others drifted free for a few moments . " I saw this car float past , " said Christmas-tree Salesman H. L. Whobrey . " It looked like there were people inside beating their hands against the windows . " <P> Two truck drivers managed to escape their sinking vehicles , unable to aid their driving partners asleep in the back . Bill Needham , 27 , of Kernersville , N.C. , was pushing a tractor-trailer rig to Milwaukee when he hit the water . <P> " I kept my eyes open , but the windows in the cab were rolled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt , holding my breath , until I noticed a little crack in the window . My partner was in the sleeping berth . He did n't have a chance for survival . " <P> <P> Rivercraft and rescue squads quickly swept.the scene for survivors , picking up at least eight , along with five bodies . Divers spotted three more corpses in a car but were unable to recover any of the victims pinned in the submerged scrap heap . It will take weeks of work to cut them all free . Some cars were doubtless swept downstream , and police estimated that it would be a long time-if ever-until a full count could be made of the victims . Mean while , Ohio Governor James Rhodes and his West Virginia counterpart , Hulett Carlson Smith , were pressing for an investigation to determine why the Silver Bridge failed .
