FOREIGN RELATIONS <P> In a classic brag designed to show that he alone dictated Soviet foreign policy , Nikita Khrushchev once declared : " When I tell Gromyko to take off his pants and sit on a cake of ice , he does it . " Last week , after sitting on the ice cake through nearly three years of steadily worsening U.S. - Soviet relations , it looked as if Khrushchev 's successors may have at last told Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko to get off and hitch up . With the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. already moving toward the conclusion of a New York-to-Moscow air pact and an outer-space treaty , the habitually dour Gromyko astounded newsmen by emerging from a State Department dinner with the observation that " both countries are striving to reach agreement " on measures to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons . <P> It was a small straw , but straws make the bricks of international agreement , and U.S. officials and newsmen alike grasped at it eagerly . Perhaps too eagerly . Before the week was out , Soviet Party Boss Leonid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he issued a tough reply to Lyndon Johnson 's recent appeal for better East-West relations . " If the U.S. wants to develop mutual relations , " snapped Brezhnev , it must " remove the main impediment , " which , in his view , is the bombing of North Viet Nam by U.S. aircraft . <P> Had Gromyko got his signals crossed ? Hardly . He told President Johnson much the same thing in a private chat at the White House last week . Yet for weeks he had also been transmitting subtle signals of encouragement . <P> Free of Flak . The first such signal was flashed when Secretary of State Dean Rusk met Gromyko at the United Nations last month and found the atmosphere refreshingly free of polemic flak . Kremlinologists thought they detected an extra beep when Gromyko , in the midst of an otherwise vituperative speech to the General Assembly , remarked : " Even when other centers of international tension appear , Europe still remains the barometer of the world 's political weather . " That , in the convoluted language of Soviet diplomacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may say in public , are tired of letting Viet Nam stand in the way of agreements elsewhere . Heartened , Rusk invited Gromyko to see President Johnson . <P> Gromyko found L.B.J. racing through a schedule that even by Lyndon 's standards was frenetic . He was boning up for his Asian tour , politicking for Democrats , discussing Viet Nam with Laos ' Prince Souvanna Phouma and Britain 's Foreign Secretary George Brown . <P> The war was also the overriding issue during Gromyko 's 1-hour 45-minute talk with the President , and U.S. officials concluded from what was said that Moscow would like to see a settlement there , but will not lift a finger toward that end until Hanoi gives the go-ahead . Leaving the White House by the back door , Gromyko headed for the State Department for a shrimp and lamb dinner with Rusk . The talk centered on prospects for a nuclear-nonproliferation treaty . " Gromyko made it very clear , " said one official , " that there will be no agreement , now or in the future , by which Germany could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that Gromyko and , obviously , his bosses were willing to talk at all indicated a shift , in view of the fact that negotiations have been stalled for nine months .
