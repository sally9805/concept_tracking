Among the professionals of world finance , the U.S. 's Robert L. Garner , 67 , talks from a background of 14 years in international economic development , first as vice president of the World Bank , then as president of the International Finance Corp . Last week , about to retire from IFC , Mississippi-born Bob Garner spoke in Vienna at the annual meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund ( see BUSINESS ) . Out of his experience , he delivered himself of some of the most sense-making ideas so far about the problems of giving foreign aid-and of receiving it . Excerpts : <P> " We need to keep in mind two significant developments in the postwar world . First , the spreading realization that no nation can today walk alone ; second , that for the first time those countries which have achieved a more abundant life have accepted responsibility to assist their poorer neighbors to improve their economic lot . Thus the less developed countries have the unique opportunity to draw on the fruits of centuries of experience , organization and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubled by the extent to which there is growing up the insidious consequences of too great reliance on foreign aid . There are too many instances where the obvious attitude is that the chief responsibility of a government is to secure the maximum help from abroad , with lesser responsibility to mobilize its own resources . Over the postwar period immense sums have been made available to the developing areas . However , to most of the recipient countries , the amounts are never sufficient . They never can be , because money alone accomplishes nothing . It is only a tool . The effective spending of large funds requires experience , competence , honesty and organization . Lacking any of these factors , large injections of capital into developing countries can cause more harm than good . <P> " Economic development or lack of it is primarily due to differences in people-in their attitudes , customs , traditions , and the consequent differences in their political , social and religious institutions . Much effort and the sacrifice of some of the accustomed ways are the inevitable price of advancement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It wo n't work . Only frustration and failure can result from seeking the fruits without being willing to pay the price of admission to modern economic society . <P> " Out of my experience , I have arrived at a few simple requirements for any country to make its way up the economic ladder : <P> &gt; " A reasonable degree of consistent law and order-government which can govern . Without a degree of continuity in political life , consistent economic growth is not possible . <P> &gt; " Reasonably honest and effective public administration . There is no denying that in many countries graft and corruption in public office lay a heavy tribute on resources which should go into development .
