All had been authorized by the Legislature . Mayor Lindsay asked originally for an increase in taxes of ; $520.5-million , out of which he had planned to give the Transit Authority $84.3-million . However , he received less than half of his request  --  a total of $253-million ? and the Legislature refused to pass a bill authorizing a transfer of city funds to the . Transit Authority . Authority Could Act Despite this refusal the City Council early Saturday morning passed a bill to transfer the funds to the authority . Mr. Lindsay has 45 days to sign or veto the fund-transfer bill .

The authority has estimated that its deficit // for the fiscal year ended July 1 will exceed $80-million . There was no activity yesterday at the authority 's headquarters at 370 Jay Street , Brooklyn , . to indicate that a decision on the fare was imminent . In addition to Mr. O'Grady , the authority members are John Gilhooley and Daniel T. Scannell .

" He added that there was " no way of knowing " how long it would take the Mayor to complete his study of the legal report . Mr. Lindsay had originally asked the Legislature for permission to impose $520.5-million in new taxes to help balance the city 's $4.5-billion budget . The Council agreed to back the Mayor 's request for new rev-1 enues because there was $84.3-million in the municipal budget earmarked for the Transit Authority .
