txt President Johnson pressed officials of his Administration today to hold down their next year 's budgets because of higher defense expenditures expected for the war in Vietnam . Secretary of Commerce John T. Connor and Secretary of Agriculture Orville L. Freeman said after discussions with Mr. Johnson at his ranch 65 miles west of here that their budgets or the fiscal year beginning July 1 would be smaller than the current fiscal year 's . At the same time , Defense Secretary Robert S. announced that the President had approved plans to build a new force of bombers to take the place of the ** and B58 's being phased out of the Strategic Bomber Force . Plan Reported Last Week Plans for developing the new bomber were reported last week and Mr. gave further hints of the new plane on Wednesday , when he announced that two-thirds of the existing force of 600 ** and all 50 of the ** in the Strategic Air Command would be inactivated by 1971 . The new plane , to be known as the FB-111 , will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F-111  --  a tactical fighter-bomber now being developed in twin versions for the Air Force and the Navy . A third version , the ** reconnaissance craft , was authorized by the Pentagon last week All four planes will be based on the controversial TFX ( tactical fighter , experimental ) with a movable wing to permit short takeoffs and high-speed flight . Authorization for the 1.75 billion FB-111 program will be sought from Congress as part of the Defense Department 's requests next year , Mr. ' said . Speedier Than the B-52 Mr. 's zrinouncement on Wednesday touched off sharp Congressional criticism , which raised the prospect of renewal of the debate over whether the Defense Department was relying too much on missiles . The new bomber , Mr. said today , will be about twice as fast and have about the same range as the B-52 's it will replace . This would mean a speed of about 2,000 miles an hour and a range of something over 6,000 miles . Mr. also said that Congressional critics of the phaseout announced Wednesday " spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eliminate bombers from the strategic forces , " he declared . The heavy bomber force now totals 680 planes , he said . At the end of this decade , it will total 465 planes , he said , and about 210 of them will be the new FB-111 's . The United States ' heavy bomber force is now four times , as large as that of the Soviet ' Union , Mr. said . He predicted that the United States would continue to have a comparable advantage . The amount that would be spent on building the nevi bomber would be less than the cost of modifying the B-52 's , Mr. said . Hence , he said , the United States will be obtaining a better bomber at less cost . Some of the new bombers are to be in use by 1968 and all units are to be equipped and in service by 1971 , Mr. said . The phaseout of twothirds of the ** and B-58 's is scheduled to coincide with the introduction of the new bombers . The defense secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locate them than with ** because they would need shorter runways for takeoffs and landings . The new bombers , he said , will be able to carry both conventional and nuclear weapons and will be able to carry fifty 750-pound high-explosive bombs . The controversy over the TFX , ancestor of the F-111 series . reached a high point in a Senate investigation in 1963 . Mr. insisted that the plane be developed so that it could be used by both the Air Force and the Navy with minor modifications , even if the performance was inferior to that of a specially designed plane for each service . The Secretary cited the superior " commonality " of the designs of the General Dynamics Corporation to justify selection of the company as the prime contractor . The uniformed heads of the two services had recommended selection of the Boeing Company 's designs . General Dynamics has retained its prime contractor role for the F-111 series . Mr. made his announcement at a news conference after conferring with President Johnson about the Defense Department budget to be submitted to Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Johnson 's ranch 65 miles west of here by Deputy Defense Secretary Cyrus H. Vance and the Joint Chiefs of Staff . The President spent the entire day in budget discussions . Aside from the Cabinet members , he saw Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg , chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission , and James E. Webb , administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration . Charles L. Schultze , Director of the Bureau of the Budget , and Joseph A. Califano , 4r. , a special assistant to the President , also came to the ranch from Washington to sit in on the meetings . Secretaries Conner and Freeman said that their budgets for next year would be less than this year 's . Mr. Connor said that he had recommended expenditures of about $1.1 billion , against $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion this year . Some of the Great Society programs administered by his department , notably the economic development program designed to assist economically distressed areas , will get off to a slower start than originally planned because of the reduction , he said . Mr. Freeman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " down from this year 's , which is about $6.9 billion , but he did not give a figure for his proposed budget . He said that the increased costs of the conflict in Vietnam had had a part in the reduction . Mr. Webb , whose space agency budget this year is nearly $5.2 billion , said that Mr. Schultze had recommended cuts in the budget sought by Mr. Webb for next year . Without giving figures , Mr. Webb said that he wanted more money for his agency this year than last . Dr. Seaborg , whose agency 's budget this year is $2.4 billion , said he expected to get less next year than he was seeking , but that this was the case every year . Budget discussions have not been completed , he said , so he could give no estimate on how much his agency would get . Mr. said he could not give a total figure for the Defense Department budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1 until further work is done on it . He said that the budget for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gross national product ? the nation 's total output of goods and servIces ? than in any of five of the last six fiscal years . He refused to be drawn into a discussion of how large he thought the gross national product would be . He said that he had discussed with the President the possibility of a supplemental appropriation request for the current fiscal year and that this almost certainly would be sought from Congress in January . He declined to say how much money would be asked . The supplemental appropriation will be required because of the increased American commitment in Vietnam . There are about 180,000 American troops in Vietnam now , Mr. said . He refused to predict how many more would be sent , but said that whatever forces United ! States military commanders in Vietnam required would be sent .
