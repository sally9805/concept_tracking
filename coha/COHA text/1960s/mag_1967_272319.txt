Ever since Thai Silk King James Thompson vanished without a trace while vacationing in the Cameron Highlands of Malaysia ( TIME , April 17 ) , his friends have grown increasingly suspicious about the disappearance . The biggest search that the highlands have ever known failed to produce a trace of Thompson . No word of his presence has filtered down from the aborigine villages of the highlands . There has been no sign of Thompson 's remains , which would certainly attract birds of prey . Hoping against hope , Thompson 's friends have therefore concluded that he may still be alive , the abducted victim of some international intrigue . <P> Last week , to back up their hopes , an anonymous group of Thompson 's friends doubled , to $25,000 , the previous reward for information that would lead to his return alive ( and offered $10.000 for proof of his death ) . Thompson 's Bangkok-based silk company sent back to the highlands for another careful look Richard Noone , 49 , a British officer in SEATO who was once an adviser to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and habits of the area 's tribes , brought along a North Borneo border scout and an aborigine witch doctor . Thompson 's friends flew in Peter Hurkos , the psychic Dutch crime detector who directed his talents toward solving the Boston Strangler case without notable success in 1964 . " Thompson is alive , " declared Hurkos . " He has been abducted to another country , but he is not being held for ransom . I would stake my neck on this . " <P> Political Abduction ? Thompson 's friends , who include former OSS agents ( Thompson first came to Thailand when working for the OSS ) and other men with experience in intelligence work , feel that he could have been kidnaped for a ransom not yet demanded . But they lean toward the belief that he was abducted for political motives . What political motives ? They are not sure , but feel that he may be the prisoner of Communists who wish to use him as some sort of intermediary or in a propaganda ploy . They point out , for example , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of the Japanese defeat in World War II . <P> These vague speculations gain some credence from a couple of suspicious events that occurred a few days before Jim Thompson disappeared from a friend 's home in the highlands . On the way there , the driver of Thompson 's taxi was mysteriously switched , whereupon the taxi headed for a garage for repairs . There , Thompson and his traveling companion were asked to take another taxi that already contained two men , but refused to share the ride . Friends figure that this may have been an abortive kidnap attempt . On the day that Thompson disappeared , a caravan of five cars was seen going up the usually traffic-free road to the highlands and coming down three hours later- right after Jim Thompson vanished .
