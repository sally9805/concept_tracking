A START IN FREEDOM by Sir Hugh Foof. 256 pages . Harper &; Row . $4.95 . <P> <P> " I am one of the last of an almost extinct species , " admits Author Foot , " a British Colonial Governor . " Few members of the species have worked harder toward self-extinction than Sir Hugh , who spent 30 years in the colonial service and was Britain 's last Governor General in Cyprus before independence . In this sprightly autobiography , which combines exploits worthy of James Bond with a scholar 's critical look at current history , Foot draws some important lessons from Britain 's race to haul down the flag . <P> Raised on Burke . Ex-Governor Foot , who is now an adviser to the U.N. , believes that the rising tide of animosity of the world 's poor nations for the rich will eventually displace the cold war as the greatest threat to peace . Britain , too , once rowed on this flood tide , he says , " but we rowed with it , not against it . The most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The people must be given a lead , a hope , an assurance that orderly and constructive effort will be worthwhile . " <P> Even among the many superbly qualified colonial administrators that Britain produced , Hugh Foot is a standout . He is a " slightly out of step " member of England 's most brilliant nonconformist family . His late father , Isaac , a deeply cultivated man who raised his family on Edmund Burke and amused himself by reading the Bible in Greek , was a Liberal Party member of Ramsay MacDonald 's 1931 coalition Cabinet . His brother Dwight was a Liberal M.P. , and another brother , Michael , is the enfant terrible of Labor 's left wing . " We liked to work to the rule , ' Let not the left Foot know what the right Foot doeth , ' " cracks Hugh . Yet the family always preserved a merry unity through a running game of intellectual oneupmanship . One famous parry came in 1958 , when Sir Hugh was trying desperately to halt the internecine war between Greek and Turkish Cypriots . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : SEE SECOND CORINTHIANS FOUR VERSES EIGHT AND NINE . *Delighted , Sir Hugh cabled back : SEE ROMANS FIVE VERSES THREE AND FOUR. + <P> Leave Him There . To most of Britain 's postwar colonial administrators , the liquidation of empire seemed a natural and even inspiring process . Foot explains : " Take a young man with only a few years ' experience in the territory to which he has been sent . Put him in charge of a District . Leave him there for say five years . He becomes wholly devoted to the people of his District . And he spends much of his effort fighting higher authority to get for his people what he thinks they need and deserve . "
