txt Five of the nine bankers on the World 's Fair Corporation 's finance advisory committee resigned yesterday in a dispute over what they called the fair 's failure to provide ' them with detailed information about . its finances . " We feel that by remaining1 on the committee we permit the implication that the fair is in a satisfactory financial condition , " said George S. Moore. , president of the First National ' City bank . Mr : Moore , who is the chair-1 man of the advisory group , said ; he was confident that the fair ) would obtain whatever funds , it ' needed and that it would reopen on schedule . He made these comments at a news conference at the bank 's ; headquarters , at 55 Wall Street. ; Others Who Resigned Resigning besides Mr. Moor &; were William S. Renchard , 1 president of the Chemical Bank New York Trust Company ; ; David Rockefeller , president of : the Chase Manhattan Bank ; 1 W. H. Moore , chairman of the Bankers Trust Company , and ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guaranty TrustI Company . Neither Mayor Wagner nor ; Robert Moses , president of the ; World 's Fair Corporation , could ; be reached , but their offices ; said they had no comment at ; this time . However , Mr. Moses ' office , : in a prepared statement co- : signed by Thomas J. Deegan ! Jr. , chairman of the fair 's ; executive committee , promised , " a full reply " later . " We want to be helpful , " Mr. Moore said , " but we have toi // know the score  --  and we do not . " He said that financial information sought by his committee had not been provided . " We are resigning because of the way finances are being handled , " he added . Mr. Moore was asked if he had any information to turn over to the office of the district attorney for investigation . " Absolutely not , " he replied . " I am simply saying that , as bankers on a finance advisory committee , we should be supplied with details of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so informed . " Mr. Moore and Mr. Renchard joined in saying that the resignation of the five committee members was " not precipitous . " The committee members who did not resign were F. H. Brandi , W. H. Morton , J. M. Schiff and A. M. White , all investment bankers . There was no comment from them . Last week , the fair announced that it would raise the admission price for adults to $2.50 from $2 when the fair reopened April 21 . The increase was attributed to rising costs , which the fair said could not be met solely by economies in management . The committee 's action followed two letters , one sent to Mr. Moses last Dec. 22 and one sent to Mr. Deegan last Saturday . The first letter was signed by Mr. Moore , the second by the five resigning committee members or their representatives . The first letter said : " Since the ' general dimensions of the fair 's financial problems are now apparent for the first time , we feel the following steps are essential : 1 . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition of the fair . " 2 . That no further financial statements or reports be issued without certification by the fair 's auditors , Peat , Marwick , Mitchell &; Co. " 3 . That the Fair Corporation develop and install procedures for fiscal and budgetary controls including personnel , which will provide assurances that all financial commitments will be within budget limits , under audit control . " Since the finance committee 's role is purely advisory and the administration of the fair is under your sole direction , subject to the board of directors , we are not suggesting the manner in which Item 3 above should be implemented . " Unless these matters can be dealt with to our satisfaction , we do not feel that we can effectively continue our advisory functions in relation to the fair 's finances . " Mr. Moore noted yesterday that Henry J. , " an extremely competent man and a former controller at Chase , " had been employed by the fair last Nov. 1 as a financial consultant . " Mr. Moses liked him till Nov. 28 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a financial report . Three days later the fair released him . " Mr. Moore said that although no reply to the December letter was received , " Mr. Moses invited us to his new apartment ? up around Gracie Square somewhere . " He said the guests stayed " about an hour . " " We had a drink and Mr. Moses showed us the view out the windows of his new apartment , " he said . Mr. Moore said that the meeting was amicable , and that Mr. Moses agreed in principle to the general tenor of the remarks in the letter . " But , " Mr. Moore said yesterday , " We want action , not just words . " Subsequently , Mr. Moore said , the second letter was drafted . The letter noted that after almost a month , the committee had been advised as to the current financial condition of the fair , in accordance with the first point of the December letter but that the second and third points had not been acted on . " Mr. Moses did ask a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to recommend a financial officer , " the second letter said , " but we do not believe that this step alone would be sufficient to meet our basic objectives . " " Meanwhile , " the letter went on , " additional financial information has been developed which increasingly emphasizes the need for prompt action . While we have not received projections prepared by auditors , it is clearly evident that the fair will need a substantial amount of outside funds between now and its opening day . " The letter added : " We feel that the only means at our disposal to bring about the action necessary to safeguard the essential interests of the city , the state and the thousands directly involved  --  employes , exhibitors , investors and others  --  is for us to resign from the finance committee . We , therefore , reluctantly , submit our resignations , effective immediately . " Mr. Moore , when asked why $7.5 million of the fair 's $30 million in bonds had been paid off last summer in light of the fair 's financial difficulties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a , $50 million surplus and would be able to pay off all its bonds by the end of last October . From Aug. 18 , 1959 , when the fair set up shop , and Aug. 31 , 1964 , the fair corporation took in $117.2 million and disbursed $104.5 million . The $12.7 million difference indicates that profits would be considerably below the $53 million predicted for the two years . It appeared doubtful that New York City would receive a $24 million reimbursement for permanent improvements for the fair , or the $29 million that was to have been earmarked for permanent parks in Flushing Meadows . Abraham D. Beanie , City Controller , commenting on the committee 's position and action , said : " I have already asked Mr. Moses and the World 's Fair Corporation as of Oct. 26 to send me a detailed statement of income and expenses and al detailed balance sheet and cash receipts and disbursements . Mr.1 Moses said there would be nra statements till after the close of the year . " Last Tuesday I wrote to Mr.1 Moses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in knowing why the surplus was only $12.7 million and I wanted to know what the outlook was . " Mr. Moses gratuitcasly suggested that we should not count on getting back the city 's entire $24 million . There is the question of how much of it we will get , if any . This brings up the question of the Controller 's right to audit . It Is my belief that I have the right of financial investigation . I still expect to get this information , and if I do n't I will keep pressing for it . " The statement by Mr. Moses and Mr. Deegan said : " The executive committee of the fair met recently and was fully informed on the subject of finances . The fair management will make no comment at this time to the finance committee members resigning but a full reply to George S. Moore will be made . " The essential interests of the city , state and thousands involved referred to by Mr. Moore are and always have been safe- , guarded . "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
