 | Do all women need husbands to be happy ? Lots of people think so . The American dream , female version , pretty much adds up to a home of your own with His-and-Hers towels and a sandbox in the backyard . And we tend to assume that , past 35 or so , an unmarried woman is either a reluctant , disappointed spinster or , perhaps , even a lesbian . The truth is , many attractive women remain unmarried by choice ? and may even end up with more happiness than girls who have walked down the aisle . This may be because a single woman 's expectations tend to be more realistic than a wife 's . Perhaps the very fact that an unmarried woman does n't really expect everything to come up roses for her ? at least not the way a bride does ? protects her from disappointments and lets her be pleasantly surprised at the way her life does turn out . At any rate , according to studies made at the National Opinion Research Center of the University of Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married men . Next on the contentment scale come single women , followed by married women and , at the very bottom , unmarried men . ( The myth of the gay bachelor would appear to be just that ? myth . Bachelors show the highest rate of sickness , instability and suicide . ) Furthermore , we do n't need the poll-takers to tell us what anyone has discovered from experience : many unmarried women enjoy interesting jobs and a full social life ; many married women are restless , bored , or just plain unhappy . It looks as though the old equation of marriage with personal fulfillment needs updating , or at least qualification . How can we explain the fact that so many women do n't seem to need men ? Well , for one thing , the world has changed . A hundred years ago , a woman had two choices : she could marry , devoting herself to the intensely real , demanding business of childbearing and housekeeping ( and maybe helping her husband plow the land and fight off Indians ) ; or she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' house , tatting doilies . No wonder the " old maid " became a comic-strip caricature ? a tiresome old busybody with no place in the social scheme . Today , of course , a woman has multiple choices . If she does n't wish to marry , she can have an intensely real life as a research chemist or an officer of a bank . Furthermore , she does n't need a husband to enjoy sex . Moral standards are more lenient than they used to be and a woman 's private life can remain just that ? provided , of course , she 's discreet about it . Contraceptive devices are reliable and easy to come by . In short , some of the old incentives to marriage ? getting a home of one 's own , safely enjoying the pleasures of sex ? do n't operate any more , or do n't operate in the same way . The changed meaning of marriage is nowhere more evident than in the cities ( and ours is increasingly an urban world ) . Women who have studied or worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drop it in exchange for a husband . As for keeping the job and taking on a husband too ? well , some girls feel the game 's not worth the candle . " If I got married , " a successful model said to me , " I 'd live just the way I do now ? only I 'd have to get up earlier to make breakfast , and remember to pick up his shirts at the laundry after work . Frankly , who needs it ? " The problem is especially acute for brainy girls who have , say , reached the mid-twenties . Up till then , they 've been too busy with college or advanced training even to consider marriage . Suddenly , they stop and look around ? and find that all the best men have been snapped up . It 's a simple fact of the marriage market that girls hope to marry up , getting husbands brighter or abler or more successful than they are ; men prefer to marry down , getting wives just a shade simpler than themselves ? nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A bright girl who ca n't marry  | up may decide not to marry at all . Or , quite simply , a bright girl with a promising career may be unwilling to commit herself permanently and exclusively to one man . She may need a man as much as the girl who starts thinking about silver patterns in high school ? but she does n't need him in the context of marriage . There are still other reasons why some women can be happy though unwed , reasons not having to do with changing times but with the essential nature of females . Women , on the whole , are less troubled by the absence of sex than men . In part , you see , our need for sex is learned . There 's a solid biological basis , of course , but a woman who has never been awakened physically may never be physically aware of sexual frustration . There are also cultural factors : a large part of the pressure for sexual gratification comes from the standards of our society and that pressure is greatest on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove their masculinity by sexual prowess . Girls prove their femininity in other ways , more passive and often independent of their sex roles . Freud 's term " sublimation " is now out of fashion , but the phenomenon it refers to ? a transformation and redirection of sexual energy into other channels ? is very real . And it usually works better for women than for men . It 's a rare man who finds important satisfaction in his role as uncle or godfather . Many women , on the other hand , can place friends or a substitute family ( nieces , nephews ) at the center of their emotional lives . It 's also true , I think , that women are more able than men to build friendships that endure for years and that offer a sense of identity . And because women are so often able to establish long-term relationships with each other , they can form stable and satisfying " home " units . Homosexuality is not necessarily , or even usually , a factor here . A women-only household can be built on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because women compromise more readily , they can continue to find satisfaction in situations which would  | ordinarily be unrewarding to men . In addition to the large numbers of women who can contrive to be happy without husbands , there are the special cases : women who definitely should n't marry . The outstanding instance of this last type is , of course , the lesbian . No one knows how many female homosexuals there are ; clinical reports indicate there are about three times as many males as female homosexuals in psychoanalytic treatment , but that may be just the tip of the iceberg . Nor can we be sure just what combination of circumstances prcduces the tragedy of lesbianism Sometimes it stems from a hostile domineering mother who may have discouraged feminine activities ? cooking and sewing and the like ? and relied heavily on her daughter as a confidante and companion . Other times the trouble starts with a little girl 's inability to resolve her sexual feelings toward her father . Some girls , unable to cope with the alarming and incestuous ? but by no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all men . A comprehensive list of women better off without husbands would include those whom psychiatrists describe as " obsessive-compulsive . ' These are women whose behavior patterns are so rigid that they can not make the adjustments necessary marriage . It would also include women who are subject to wild shifts of mood , from unnatural excitement to suicidal depression ; women with a " district attorney " cast of mind ( " Where did you go ? Who with ? " ) ; women who never succeeded during adolescence in separating themselves from their parents ; women who shy away from all physical contact ; women who have n't the emotional stamina for a longterm partnership .... And so on . In short , marriage is not necessary for everyone . The human psyche is marvelous in its variety and flexibility . Perhaps , as we move toward a more diversified and open society , we will recognize this and recognize , too , that there are many legitimate paths to fulfillment . They do n't all involve a wedding ring .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
