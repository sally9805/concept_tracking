Relaxed from a tranquilizer , the 65-year-old woman , an abdominal cancer victim , lay quietly on an operating table in the University of Mississippi 's Medical Center . Anesthesiologist Leonard Fabian opened her mouth , sprayed a local anesthetic on her throat , inserted an " airway tube " to ensure unobstructed breathing . Under the watchful eye of Surgeon James Hardy , Dr. Fabian attached a tiny electrode to each of the woman 's temples . At his signal , a technician turned a control on the face of a small box from which thin wires trailed out to the electrodes . Within 60 seconds the woman was sound asleep , and the operation began-first ever performed in the U.S. under electrical anesthesia . <P> Because sending electric currents through the brain can produce death and convulsions , scientists have long suspected that they could anesthetize surgical patients by some precise combination of voltage , current and frequency . To the U.S. Army , the idea was especially attractive : it was hunting for a safe , simple way to anesthetize battlefield patients without the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , doctors at the University of Mississippi , experimenting with dogs and monkeys , set out to construct a cheap mobile unit that could be used to shock human patients to sleep . <P> " Most of the difficulty arises in the fine line that separates anesthesia from convulsions , " says Lieut . Colonel John Moncrief , who monitored the project . The Mississippi machine , although still experimental , looks promising : it puts the patient to sleep , keeps him under as long as the current remains constant , permits him to awaken within 60 seconds after the juice is turned off . It uses 22-30 volts , 50 milliamperes , and a frequency that is brought up from 0 to 700 cycles to put the patient under . It causes some spasms , which drugs easily stop , but produces no convulsions , loss of memory or even headache . Its price : $150 . Commented the first patient : " I did n't feel a thing .
