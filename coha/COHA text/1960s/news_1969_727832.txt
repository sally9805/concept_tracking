txt Prof. Jdseph J. Copeland of the City College biology department was named yesterday as acting president of the college . The choice of the new president , who will take over in a period of turmoil , was announced by the executive committee of the Board of Higher Education after a three-hour meeting . The session was held under considerable pressure because Dr. Buell G. Gallagher , president of City College , in a resignation statement on Friday , said he wanted to be relieved of his duties by 9 A.M. tomorrow . Dr. Copeland , 61 years old , has been on the faculty for 41 years . He was one of the three faculty members involved in recent negotiations with dissident Negro and Puerto Rican students . Disorders on the City College campus have caused its closing for much of the last two weeks . Calm on the Campus Dr. Copeland said he hoped to resume negotations with demonstrating students beginning tomorrow . He is waiting until tomorrow to explain his own approach to problems at City College , but he made it clear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting was conducted under severe pressure , the campus itself was calm yesterday . Few classes were scheduled and the police outnumbered the students . Policemen were stationed outside all of the 22 college buildings and other policemen patrolled the campus on motor scooters . At other city campuses that had reported trouble during the week ? Brooklyn College , Queensborough Community College and Pratt Institute ? there were no disturbances . Class was scheduled for tomorrow at all of these schools , as well as at City College . The disturbances at City College have stemmed from five demands by Negro and Puerto Rican students , including an in- ' sistence that the percentage of /Negroes and Puerto Ricans in ' new freshman classes be increased to about 50 per cent to reflect the ratio of these groups in the city 's public high schools . The percentage was about 24 ' per cent in the last freshman class .

Teaching Is Preferred Dr. Copeland , a botanist who ' prefers teaching and research/ to academic administration , , said that he would accept ap-1 pointment as acting president , " during this period of campus unrest because I do not believe in offering opinions without accepting the responsibility , if called upon , to implement them . " TiEt son of an Indiana Quak2 er minister and a self-described " philosophical pacifist , " Dr. Copeland interrupted his teaching career twice to serve in the armed forces : three years during World War II as an Army Air Force volunteer , two years during the Korean conflict in response to a reserve officer call-up . Dr. Copeland looks to a " rational solution " of problems confronting City College . " I am basically sympathetic to the demands of the black and Puerto Rican students , " he said . " I became even more so during the recent negotiations and , while I do not regard illegal action as either proper or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can not be dodged by tokenism or solved by brute power . " Referring to the demands made by black and Puerto Rican students in an address to members of the faculty April , 30 , he said at one point : " We are not giving these people a fair break , and before God we will do it . " He sharply criticized members of Students for a Democratic Society in the same speech , however , saying : " Their program is to tear down . They are dropouts . " Referring again to the blacks and Puerto Ricans , he said : " I would rather irre New York l roes Prof. Joseph J. Copeland deal with people who want to , make improvements . " " We can win what would be ' a military victory here , " he continued , ' ' hut what advantage . would it be to walk in the , smoke and ashes of Harlem ?

For many years Dr. Copeland was a resource consultant to the New York City Police De-1 partment on botanical evi- ! dence . In one case that received widespread press coverage , he , was able to show that tiny ' grass seeds found in the pockets ) of a murder suspect were ! grown in a particular area of ! Central Park , where the vic-. aim 's body was found . That case occurred early 1943 , when Dr. Copeland , then ' a lieutenant in the Air Force described in minute detail to a jury the appearances and characteristics of Plantago lanceolata , Panicum dichotimalorum , Eleusine indica and other grasses that grow in Central Park . The seeds from the same kind of grasses had been found in the pockets of Anibal Almodovar , a 21-year-old former seaman and clothes presser , who was on trial for strangling his 20-year-old wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The blue ribbon jury found him guilty and he was put to death in the electric chair at Sing Sing Prison on Sept. 16 , 1943 . Dr. Copeland was active in efforts to obtain integration of Mount Vernon public schools and was elected by his neighborhood association to present its views on local zoning problems to the City Council of that city . The City College controversy was the subject of political attention yesterday , with two State Senators clashing as the State Senate Committee on New York City prepared to begin closed hearings on campus disorders here this week . At a news conference at 270 Broadway , the chairman of the committee , State Senator John J. March ; of Staten Island , a candidate for mayor in the Republican primary and the unopposed Conservative nominee , said policemen should be sent to campuses when needed , adding : " There is no privileged sanctuary . I reject this as utterly ridiculous . " But Senator Seymour R.

" The subject of politics was injected into the City College situation by Dr. Gallagher on Friday when , in his resignation statement , he declared : " With the intrusion of politically motivated outside forces in recvent days , it has become impossible to carry on the processes of reason and persuasion . " Dr. Gallagher has refused to amplify on his remark , except to say it was the reason he is not remaining until the end of the semester . He had tendered his resignation last February in protest against budget cuts . The resignation has greatly complicated the already difficult problem of trying to reopen negotiations between dissident students and the college administration that were broken off when the 20,000-student school was ordered reopened . City College has been in almost constant crisis since April 22 , when about 200 Negro and ' Puerto Rican students barricaded themselves inside the South Campus , cutting off student access to eight buildings . As negotiations were opened , Dr. Gallagher ordered the college closed . The Board of Higher Education , under pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the wake of racial clashes among students , Dr. Gallagher closed the school lege administration that were broken off when the 20,000-again . On Thursday , fires broke out and new clashes , broke out among students . The school remained open on Friday at the behest of the Board of Higher Education and there was no trouble . At Pratt Institute in Brooklyn , the Black Students Union reached a negotiated agreement yesterday with the president , ' Dr. James B. Donovan , on black student demands for a greater role in policy . In a statement , the union suggested that other colleges could avoid violence by following Pratt 's example . Brooklyn College , where there where many incidents of vandalism , and student clashes last week , was calm yesterday . Queensborough Community College was also quiet . In that Bayside school last week , there were two days of violence and on Friday a convocation of faculty members and students was ended after a bomb scare .                  @ @ @
