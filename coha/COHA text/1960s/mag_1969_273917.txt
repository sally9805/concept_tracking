As a self-proclaimed free trader , President Nixon is plainly on the spot . His campaign commitment to protect the U.S. textile industry earned him Southern votes , but it also encouraged other industries to clamor for new barriers to imports . The line-up of supplicants now includes such diverse groups as steelmen , strawberry growers , carpet weavers , piano makers , beekeepers , glass producers . <P> Next to textile men , no other group has flexed as much political muscle as shoe manufacturers . By last week 303 members of the House had petitioned President Nixon for " voluntary " import restrictions on shoes . On a similar petition in the Senate , Republican Margaret Chase Smith of Maine gathered another 59 signatures , including those of Senators Edward Kennedy and Edmund Muskie . <P> Unique Penetration . Support for the trade-restricting measures cuts through geographic and party lines because shoe manufacturing is scattered across 40 states . It is a principal industry in New England and ranks high in Pennsylvania , Tennessee , Missouri , Arkansas , Ohio and North Carolina . Altogether , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of them located in small towns where they are vital to the local economy . <P> " The shoe industry , " says Congressman James A. Burke of Massachusetts , a chief promoter of curbs , " is seeking a reasonable solution such as quotas based on the 1968 import levels , perhaps allowing for a 5% increase per year . " Industry spokesmen claim that expanding imports of leather and vinyl shoes-mostly from Italy and Japan - have for years absorbed all the growth in the U.S. market . Since 1955 , imports have risen from 8,000,000 pairs representing only a 1% share of the domestic market to last year 's 175 million pairs , or about 21% of the market . " No other industry that now enjoys import limitation or even the promise of import limitation can show market penetration of 21% , " says Senator Smith . " Seven plants closed in New England during the first four months of 1969 with imports cited as a major factor in each case . " <P> Scapegoats . For all those figures , there is considerable evidence that foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is struggling with problems reaching far beyond import competition . The industry includes hundreds of small , lightly cap italized firms , and many plant closings are the result of mergers and acquisitions , not foreign competition . <P> Domestic manufacturers blame their troubles primarily on the gap between U.S. and foreign wages . In the U.S. , wages and benefits for shoe workers average $2.75 an hour , compared with $1 in Italy , 560 in Spain , 580 in Japan and 480 in Taiwan . Labor is indeed a prime cost factor in an industry that has never been able to mechanize to any great extent . But price is not the only reason that the imports do so well . Craftsmanship and leadership in styling are equally valid explanations for the appeal of foreign shoes , particularly those from Italy , which account for 35% of the imports .
