 | Slow , deadly poisoning is hardly the first thought that comes to mind when a healthy young family starts complaining of fatigue , poor appetite and off-and-on stomach pains . Yet that was exactly what was happening to Dr. Thomas J. McDevitt and his family : mother , father and three small children were gradually dying of a deadly poison . And in true mysterystory tradition the lethal dosage was being delivered to them by an altogether innocent-appearing , everyday household object . It began almost three years ago when Tom McDevitt , then a young physician-in-training at a veterans hospital in Los Angeles , found he was tired all the time and had no appetite . His redheaded wife , Bruna , could barely drag herself through the day 's work and often had mild stomach discomfort . Little Sean , almost four , merely picked at his food . Three-yearold Margie , normally a good eater , now left her meals half finished . Charlie , just one and a half , cried a lot and hardly ate . All three children suffered from frequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chirpy , uncomplaining and hungry . " I guess we all have a touch of the flu , " Tom told Bruna . " There 's been a lot of it around this winter . " Although they were all under par , no one in the family was quite sick enough to call off the party for Sean 's fourth birthday on February 25 . But Bruna kept the plans as uncomplicated as possible ? just cake and ice cream in the backyard for a few neighborhood children . The young guests happily romped through party games and gobbled their refreshments , but the listless McDevitt youngsters failed to brighten up even for the party . Sean was particularly irritable and at one point got into a quarrel with another little boy who pushed him to the concrete walk . Sean got up in tears , with a bump on his forehead ? a bump that , as events worked out , may well have saved his life , but which at the time no one noticed . After his friends left , Sean moped about the house , skipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A half hour later Tom heard sounds of distress from Sean 's bedroom and found the boy vomiting in his sleep . While he was changing his son 's pa- jamas , he noticed that Sean moved as if in a daze . " Let me see you move your leg , " Tom said gently . His son seemed puzzled and looked up with a kind of helpless expression . It was then Tom realized his son was paralyzed on the left side . A doctor often gets more frightened than other parents , for he is thoroughly aware of the disasters that can befall a child . Tom 's own area of specialization was ear , nose and throat , and facial plastic surgery , but he had studied and seen head injuries . He knew that paralysis following a head blow usually means that a blood vessel in the brain has broken . If that 's the case , surgery is required to relieve pressure on the brain and prevent coma and death . In seconds Tom was on the phone to the family 's pediatrician , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Hospital in Santa Monica for emergency surgery . Tom rushed the boy to the hospital , while Bruna stayed at home with the other children and tried to control her terrors . Although the paralysis had lessened by , the time Sean reached the hospital , the boy still had only limited motion on his left side and there was some weakness in his facial muscles . Dr. Duke Hanna , the  | neurosurgeon , and his surgical team thought the improvement was a good sign , but nevertheless wanted to go ahead with a surgical investigation of Sean 's brain . They reasoned this way : If the paralysis was just a transient phenomenon , caused by a little brain swelling , then Sean would have undergone unnecessary surgery . But if the paralysis was due to hemorrhage , the operation could save his life . The decision was for immediate surgery . After Sean was anesthetized and his red hair shaved off , the results of routine blood-and-urine examinations were brought to the operating room . The blood showed a marked anemia , with a blood count low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzled at this finding . Bruna McDevitt always served nutritious , well-balanced meals and insisted that the youngsters clean their plates and drink plenty of milk and fruit juice . How could Sean be anemic ? Tom had little time to ponder this problem , for the surgeon was already making an opening in Sean 's skull with an instrument much like a carpenter 's drill . As the bone was removed , the outer brain covering , called the dura , bulged up into the hole . Dr. Hanna then made an incision into the dura . There was a gush of clear , cerebral spinal fluid , but no blood . Greatly relieved , Tom hurried to the telephone to forward the good news to Bruna . " No hemorrhage , " he told her happily . " Sean 's going to be all right . " Weeks later Tom found out that the surgeons had been less optimistic at that point than he , for they had feared the gush of cerebral fluid under pressure could indicate an even more dread condition , a brain tumor . Nonetheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to alarm the parents . Meantime , they kept Sean in bed and gave him blood transfusions for his anemia . Almost immediately the little boy bounced back to rosy-cheeked good health and all his symptoms vanished . The first few days back at home Sean had a vigorous appetite , but before long his desire for food started declining again and his good color faded . The other children , Margie and Charlie , also were showing less and less interest in eating . Could they be ruining their appetites by filling up on juice before dinner ? their father wondered . For a few days the McDevitts kept the juice pitcher off the table and sure enough , the whole family began to eat better . But Tom and Bruna believed fresh fruit juice was important for growing children and for adults , too , especially after a bout with the flu . So the juice pitcher came back , with the children being limited to half a glass before meals . Within weeks , the trouble began again . Now it was little Margie who seemed most irritable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ household , as she usually did , Margie would sit quietly on the floor and often cry for no reason . But it was hard to believe there could be anything seriously wrong with her ; she 'd had a complete physical checkup only a few weeks before and had been pronounced in perfect health . Still , knowing there was diabetes in the family , Tom decided that maybe some more tests were in order . He took samples of the little girl 's blood and specimens  | of her urine to the laboratory at the hospital where he was training . The next day the laboratory reported that the diabetes tests were normal , but the blood showed serious anemia . In order to examine the individual red blood cells the technologist took more blood from Margie and also drew some from Tom to compare with his daughter 's . That same afternoon Chief Pathologist Dr. Fishkin called Tom to his office . He looked up from his microscope only after Tom had waited a long moment , and said , " Dr. McDevitt , both you and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are being poisoned . " Tom was too stunned to answer . " The tests show nearly lethal doses of lead poisoning , " Dr. Fishkin went on . " Lead , as you know , Tom , is a cumulative poison and you have about reached your limit . " Lead poisoning ! It was almost impossible for Tom McDevitt to accept the idea . In his medical studies he had learned about the hazards of lead poisoning in industry . He knew that ingesting the metal or inhaling its fumes could cause extreme stomach discomfort , anemia and in severe cases brain damage and death . He had even read that some experts attributed the decline and fall of the Roman Empire in large part to poisoning of the people from lead-lined cisterns and pots and lead-based cosmetics and paints . But the idea that his family ? his wife , three children , he himself ? was falling victim to this deadly poison was too much to grasp . Besides , how was it happening ? How could all of the McDevitts be absorbing lethal quantities of lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxious period of detective work . First , Tom checked the plumbing in their home to make sure there were no lead pipes . None could be found . Just to be doubly sure , he had the water tested . It proved pure . Could the children be chewing on something painted with lead-based paint ? Since obviously neither he nor Bruna were given to gnawing on painted crib rails or windowsills , that could just about be eliminated as an explanation . Tom checked anyway and came to another dead end . Meanwhile further blood analysis had established beyond all doubt that the ill health of five of the six McDevitts and also Sean 's paralysis and brain swelling were due to lead poisoning . Only the baby was untainted . Lead was unquestionably the villain ? and just as unquestionably the McDevitts were getting sicker day by day . Dr. Fishkin urged the family to get out of their house . " It may be the only way to save your lives . " Tom and Bruna began a frantic search for a new house that would accommodate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet in the back of their minds was the nagging worry that even after the heavy expense and trouble of a move , they might find that they had packed up the unknown source of the poisoning and moved it right along with them . This fear was working away at Tom one morning as he watched Bruna pouring orange juice for the family from a brown earthenware pitcher that a friend had brought them from Mexico at Christmas . Ever since then , the graceful container had been in steady use on the table as a juice pitcher and its matching mugs had remained decoratively on a shelf . Suddenly some vaguely remembered connection between ceramics and lead popped into Tom 's mind . He recalled from a highschool shop class that lead was an important ingredient in pottery glaze . He looked hard at the pitcher . All the family , except the baby who was still on formula , drank juice from it daily . And all the family , except the baby , was being poisoned . " Empty the pitcher , " Tom told Bruna . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Santa Monica Public Health Department cut through its own red tape and went into action immediately . Next day Dr. H. N. Broderson , the district health officer , called Tom to present him triumphantly with a small plastic bag full of a white powder . " A little present from the health department , " he said to Tom McDevitt . " Pure lead chromate ? enough to kill two people . It came out of your juice pitcher in just one washing with acid . "  | The mystery was solved . The McDevitt children spent days in the hospital in a painful series of treatments that removed stored lead from their bodies . The parents , less affected because of their size and the smaller amounts of juice they drank , were treated at home with penicillin . In less than two weeks after Tom snatched the pottery pitcher from Bruna 's hand , the McDevitts ? adults and children ? had regained their appetites , their energy , their high spirits and their good health . But the episode was not entirely over . Tom McDevitt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a situation that had led his family to the brink of death . How many other families unknowingly faced the menace of lead poisoning in their homes ? How could they be warned and saved ? Tom set himself the task of finding out . He learned that lead compounds are widely used in ceramic glazes to achieve a smooth , lustrous surface resistant to high and low temperatures . When properly applied , as they are by all commercial manufacturers and large potters in this country , these glazes are harmless . But handcrafted and " folk " pottery does not always follow such exacting standards . The McDevitts ' pitcher was typical of the inexpensive brown ware and painted cream-colored pottery that is available all over Mexico and in the Southwest U.S. , as well as in specialty shops elsewhere in this country . If pottery of this type is not fired long enough at high enough temperatures , the glaze fails to seal completely . When an acid , such as orange juice , is poured into a poorly glazed pitcher , the lead leaches into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead it gives off , ranging from insignificant traces to dangerous doses . The public , Tom soon found out , has no protection from this health hazard . Even though the problem of lead-leaching in pottery has been known for 150 years , there are no import restrictions or required inspections for handmade pottery sold in Mexico and brought into the U.S. No  | labels warn users of possible dangers . And a bad glaze can not be detected merely by looking at the pottery . Tom set to work on many fronts to change this situation . He 's still at it . One of his projects is to extend to the small pottery producers of Mexico the standards set by the United States Potters Association , which are in effect among ceramic makers in this country , Japan and many European countries . He and other health authorities have tried to alert the Mexican government to the health risks faced by Mexican people . Dr. Evan Cambell of the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratories , who has tested Mexican earthenware , feels that there may well be a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the symptoms are so easily confused with malnutrition that damage by lead has so far gone unmeasured . In his talks before medical and lay groups , Tom McDevitt repeatedly urges his listeners never to put acidbased foods in folk-crafted pottery that has a glaze . And if such pottery is to be used regularly for food of any type , it should first be treated in order to wash out the lead in the glaze . The platter or pitcher or bowl should first be washed with soap and water and allowed to dry completely . Then the surfaces are rubbed with lard and the utensil heated in a hot oven for at least 30 minutes . After it has cooled , the inside should be washed out several times with vinegar . Finally , it should be filled with vinegar and stand for several hours or overnight . ( Do not put vinegar in the vessel while it is in the oven because of the production of irritating vapors . ) These precautions should get rid of loose lead which foods might otherwise pick up . The McDevitts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Understandably they no longer use any folk pottery for food . Such a simple thing as labeling the pottery could have saved us all from illness and our son from serious surgery , " says Bruna McDevitt . " I often wonder how many other cases are n't detected soon enough ? or at all . That 's why Tom , as a doctor , feels he has to keep working to help other families avoid the near tragedy that struck us. "
