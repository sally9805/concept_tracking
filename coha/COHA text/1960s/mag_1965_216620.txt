The grey-haired spinster waved a delicate , S-shaped twist of plastic at her audience of newsmen in New Delhi last week and announced triumphantly : " It 's foolproof . " What Dr. Sushila Nayar , India 's Health Minister , held aloft was a contraceptive device . She was opening Family Planning Week , the start of a new government campaign against the nation 's severest problem : overpopulation . <P> The problem is everywhere to behold-in fly-filled villages , along dusty bullock paths , in the dismal density of city tenements-millions of people trapped in desperate squalor . In the hope of ending all this , India has struggled ineffectually for years to promote family planning . The rhythm method proved too complicated for a 75% illiterate population . To help women keep track of the days of the month , the government devised a handy string of beads ( green for safe days , black for unsafe ) . Children upset the arithmetic by toying with the beads . Some women mistook the strings for a charm against conception ; others shunned them because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as decoration . Other methods-even the pill-proved too costly or required too much medical supervision . More than 800,000 persons have submitted to voluntary sterilization since 1956 , but this has not substantially reduced the country 's birth rate . <P> <P> Subsidized Control . Though Dr. Nayar herself had long been a birth-control skeptic in the Gandhi tradition ( she was once his private physician ) , she agreed three years ago to test the Lippes loop , a U.S.-designed intrauterine contraceptive device that prevents the development of a fetus in the womb . Only eleven of the 2,839 Indian women fitted with them last year became pregnant , and five of these conceived after their little white loops had been removed . That convinced her , she said last week , that Lippes loops are " the answer " to India 's problem . <P> The loops cost so little to manufacture ( 1 each ) that the Indian government expects to give away 1,000,000 within a year , 2,000,000 a year by 1967 , and 5,000,000 a year after that . While the country prepares a plant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loops from the Manhattan-based Population Council . Radio broadcasts , movies and roving clinics will explain the device in thousands of villages , and the government will divide a $1-per-insertion subsidy among midwives who bring women to the clinics , doctors who insert the loops , and local agencies that administer the program . Tradition may be against it , but last week the Municipal Corporation of Delhi bought newspaper space to advertise : " A small family is a happy family . Plan your family the ' loop ' way .
