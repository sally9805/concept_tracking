For a distinguished example of local reporting in a United States newspaper , published daily , Sunday , or at least once a week , during the year , the test being the quality of local news stories written under the pressure of edition time . <P> - Pulitzer Prize category <P> It was the Fourth of July , and Robert David Mullins , the Salt Lake City Deseret News correspondent in Price , Utah , a mining town 125 miles south of the state capital , was celebrating the holiday by watching his four-year-old daughter wave sparklers in the warm desert evening . Then the phone rang . Murder had been done in Monticello , a tiny village 150 miles away . Correspondent Mullins , whose beat covers four counties and 17,488 sq . mi. , is thoroughly conditioned to long-distance assignments ; he wasted no time getting to work . <P> On the way , Mullins stopped off in the town of Moab , and there he got word of an even juicier crime . Near by , on a mesa called Dead Horse Point , someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wounded Charles Boothroyd , 55 , shot and killed Mrs. Jeannette Sullivan , 41 , and vanished into the desert with Mrs. Sullivan 's teen-age daughter Denise ( TIME , July 14 ) . Cursing his reportorial luck-the timing meant that the evening Deseret News 's competitor , the morning Tribune , would print the story first . Correspondent Mullins forgot about Monticello and headed for Dead Horse Point . <P> Bad Timing . Time worked against Mullins and the Deseret News on nearly every important development of the case . The morning Tribune was so emphatically first with the murder-abduction that when Mullins ' story appeared in the afternoon , it did not even rate column eight-the preferred Page One spot for the big story of the day . Once more , simply because it was a morning paper , the Tribune scooped the Deseret News on the apprehension of the killer . Even more embarrassing , the guilty man turned out to be one Abel Aragon , one of Mullins ' neighbors back home in Price , who put a bullet in his head when FBI men stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Mullins ruefully , before stitching together what was by necessity largely an echo of the Tribune 's earlier coverage . <P> Correspondent Mullins doggedly stayed with the case until the search for Denise Sullivan was called off ( her body has not yet been found ) . He logged 1,800 miles-much of it driving the 500-mile round trip to Salt Lake City with photographs . " Stamina , " as Mullins himself put it , was about all the story required , and that Mullins had . At length , his stamina delivered a modest payoff . The reporter was with a search party in the desert when the murder gun was found one morning . Mullins begged the use of a mining company 's two-way radio and flashed word of the discovery in time for the Deseret News 's final edition .
