Dramatic and dangerous as it was , the seizure of the U.S.S. Pueblo was only the latest and loudest thunderbolt from a long-gathering storm of North Korean belligerence . Under Premier Kim II Sung , a tough , Soviet-trained soldier , the North has become increasingly frustrated by its place in the Communist world and its poor showing visa-vis South Korea . Moved by the desire to bolster his regime internally and win some international notice and prestige - plus his oft-stated desire to distract the U.S. from its role in Viet Nam-Kim has deliberately launched his country on a high-risk policy . <P> The North has plenty of reason to feel frustrated . Its seven-year plan , due to end last year , failed to meet its goals and had to be extended-while South Korea 's healthy economy was spurting ahead at a G.N.P . rate of 8.4% in 1967 . Kim and his government failed in their efforts to disrupt the South Korean presidential elections last spring , watched with embarrassment while South Korea sent 46,000 men to fight its Communist allies in Viet Nam . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of North and South Korea realized before he reaches 61 , the all-important year in a man 's life cycle according to the Korean zodiac . <P> Brazen Incursion . As that prospect dimmed in the face of Southern success and stagnation in the North , Kim switched from talking about " peaceful " reunification and declared : " We must accomplish the South Korean revolution and unify the fatherland in our generation . " To that end , he set up subversion and terrorist schools in North Korea , where some 2,400 commandos are now being trained to infiltrate the South to start a guerrilla war . The results have become apparent in the North 's new aggressiveness along the Demilitarized Zone at the 38th parallel . In 1967 , there were 566 North Korean infiltration incidents v. only 50 in 1966 ; 117 exchanges of fire compared with only 19 in 1966 ; and 122 men of the U.N . command killed ( including 16 Americans ) v. 35 the year before . No wonder Kim warned recently that " a tense situation in which a war may break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> Last week , just two days before the Pueblo 's seizure , North Korea made the most brazen incursion into South Korea to date . From its subversion camps , it dispatched 31 North Korean agents into the South in a meticulously planned attempt to assassinate South Korean President Chung Hee Park . Their orders : make their way into the Blue House residence of the President in Seoul , cut off Park 's head and pitch it into the street . The attack marked the first time since the Korean armistice in 1953 that a large number of North Korean terrorists had had the audacity to enter the capital . <P> Organized into six groups , each commanded by a North Korean army captain , the assassination team members had trained for two years in guerrilla-warfare tactics , then practiced their assignment for 15 days in a mock-up model of the Blue House erected in their base at Wonsan . Setting out on foot to slip through the snowy DMZ , each of the 31 wore an overcoat , black sneakers and a woollen winter cap and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun , a pistol , a dagger , eight hand grenades and one antitank grenade .
