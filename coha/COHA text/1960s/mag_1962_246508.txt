Posted throughout Dunbar Vocational High School are cards bearing a Ben Franklin motto : " He that hath a trade hath an estate . " The exhortation is hardly needed at the rambling tan brick school on Chicago 's squalid South Side . To its 2,300 youngsters , 99% of them Negro , Dunbar is a life raft in a sea of poverty . It is perhaps the most effective vocational school in the U.S. <P> <P> Dunbar 's importance lies in harsh statistics : 30% of U.S. high school students never graduate ; the rate hits 50% in some blighted urban areas . As automation invades new fields , as unions make old fields tougher to enter , the unskilled dropouts are almost unemployable . Unwanted , they wallow in anger and sometimes crime . The U.S. can ill afford such " social dynamite , " wrote James B. Conant recently in Shims and Suburbs . At Chicago 's Dunbar , * Conant was delighted to find just about " the ideal in vocational education .

Assistant Principal Victor D. Lewis recalls , for example , " a big decorating firm downtown that would n't hire a Negro , even to clean a brush . Now one of our people is a foreman there . We simply produced a good decorator and challenged them to hire him . " <P> Too Busy for Trouble . Dunbar keeps in close touch with the job market , constantly seeks to raise its high level of basic training . The school 's 37 shop teachers all have at least ten years ' outside experience , stay well up on new techniques . Stressing meat-and-potatoes training that will pay off on payday , they talk up the benefits of belonging to a union ( many do themselves ) . <P> To produce " employable " graduates , Dunbar insists on promptness and tidiness . The students work harder and longer ( and drop out less often-the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high schools . Discipline is well in hand . Future aircraft mechanics are too busy peering into a jet engine , or revving up a mounted piston engine , to get into much trouble . In the auto shop , young tinkerers stay out of trouble with " outside jobs . " At Dunbar , a pricewise Chicagoan can get a Cadillac engine overhauled for $160 , v. $350 at the factory . <P> Academic work is not skimped : Dunbar requires four years of English , three years of science and social studies , two years of mathematics . The problem is how to make this palatable for future beauticians and bricklayers . Dunbar has a handy solution : it puts all machinist students in the same math class , for example , so the teacher can deal not only with abstractions but also with applications of math to machine tools . Dunbar 's graduates also acquire enough academic work to enter college if they wish to ( 10% to 15% do ) . Says Principal Joseph J.
