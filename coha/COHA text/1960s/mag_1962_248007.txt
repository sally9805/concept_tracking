TO speak of Alexander Archipenko is , for many , to speak of a ghost-an artist whose glories are in the past and who only haunts the present . Yet no ghost could be more lively . This week an Archipenko retrospective will open at Manhattan 's Perls Galleries , and another show will head for a tour of Canada . Archipenko has always been an innovator ; at 74 , he still is . <P> Archipenko 's father was a mildly successful inventor in the Russian city of Kiev , and invention has held a fascination for Archipenko all his life . While the father thought of an invention as a mechanical problem , the son saw it also as an esthetic one , an assemblage of forms . By the time he moved to Paris at the age of 21 , young Archipenko was not only a trained engineer but an accomplished sculptor as well . <P> In 1908 , when the cubist paintings of Picasso and Braque began to appear in Paris , Archipenko fell under their spell . He was perhaps the first ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his work of that great period ( see color seems as vital as it was when it was done in the years before the first World War . But if these show Archipenko at his most memorable , they do not fully reveal him . <P> When he first settled in the U.S. in 1923 , he was hailed by the critics as " the greatest sculptor since Rodin . " The fact was that he loathed Rodin . " Since photography , " he said , " representation is unnecessary . " His **30;2908;TOOLONG shapes arranged , friezelike , upon a flat plane - were pioneer constructions . He boldly used glass , wood , clay , metal or mother-of-pearl to achieve new effects , often allowing the materials to shape their own destinies , much as today 's abstractionists let their work grow out of itself . Long before the younger Henry Moore , he gouged holes in his sculpture to turn space inside out ; often he would make concave what nature had made convex . He was-and still is - one of the few sculptors to use color to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , should know color as well , as form ; " This was true of the ancients , in Greece , in India , " <P> There are times in Archipenko 's more recent work when experiment drowns out art , when the struggle is too obvious , the effect too contrived . But in 1961 he could still turn out work of extraordinary range . His Kimono at the Perls Galleries has the simple and timeless authority of a primitive mask ; his Linear Oriental is a daring swoop of lines as graceful as a woman 's dress . Archipenko is not much in fashion these days ; yet the old freshness still shows through . Modern art owes him a debt , and the debt has not all been paid .
