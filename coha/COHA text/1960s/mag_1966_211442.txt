In a part of the world never known for unity , the oil-rich countries of the Middle East have been unusually har monious in demanding " akthar , akthar " ( more , more ) from the Western oil consortiums . The loudest voice has come from Syria , which has no wells but makes do with the next-best thing : a 305-mile stretch of the pipeline through which the Iraq Petroleum Co. pumps oil from its Iraq field to the Syrian port of Baniyas on the Mediterranean . Last week , after weeks of futile negotiations on new rates , Damascus seized the pipeline " to achieve the full rights of the people . " <P> The I.P.C. , composed of French , British and U.S. partners , including Mobil and Jersey Standard , considers Syria 's demands " fantastic . " Syria wants its annual take increased by $15 million to $43 million ; on top of that , it is asking for another $11 million a year over the next decade to make up for what it calls " faulty accounting " in I.P.C. 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sums , Syria at first threatened to blow up the pipeline , then decided to seize it and force I.P.C. to run it under government supervision . As things stand , I.P.C. may have to double its annual shellout to $56 million before it can get its pipeline back . <P> It may be no consolation to I.P.C. , but every Western outfit in the Persian Gulf area may soon be paying more . Iran is demanding that its producers increase their output by 17.5% this year to boost its royalties to $625 million . Iraq wants production increased by 10% to bring its revenues to $372 million . Kuwait has decided that its $636 million annual take is not enough . <P> There is more than simple greed behind the pressure . The Persian Gulf countries want high pumping quotas as insurance against competition from new oil sources being developed in areas closer to world markets . By year 's end Libya will pass Iraq in production , rank fourth in the Middle East ( after Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , and Iran ) . Algerian production is growing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . Before long , Egypt will be in the market , thanks to a Phillips Petroleum strike near El Alamein announced last week . <P> All of this puts the major oil companies in a better bargaining position than ever before . With new , often cheaper sources available elsewhere , they are not as dependent as the sheiks are on Persian Gulf oil . Syria , among others , does not yet seem to have got the word .
