Defense attorneys at the raucous trial of the Chicago Eight are doing their best to show that U.S. District Judge Julius Hoffman is biased . The little jurist often seems determined to prove them right . Before the jury , he has praised U.S. Attorney Thomas Foran as one of the finest prosecutors in the country . On the other hand , he badgers and belittles lawyers for the eight men who are charged with conspiracy to foment a riot at last year 's Democratic Convention in Chicago . <P> The 74-year-old judge unquestionably has been provoked . Last week , for example , the defendants draped a large Viet Cong flag over the counsel table after Hoffman denied them a day off to participate in the nationwide peace demonstrations . Foran denounced Attorney William Kunstler for supporting the defendants ' efforts to bring the Moratorium into the courtroom . After an angry exchange , Foran growled : " I have contempt for Mr. Kunstler . " The judge rebuked only Kunstler . As the dominant figure in the courtroom , a judge can easily influence the jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convicted , the Chicago Eight are likely to argue on appeal that they were unable to get a fair trial because of Hoffman 's attitude . <P> Quoted in Jerusalem . As might be expected , Hoffman bristles at criticism of his handling of the trial . " I do n't want to be glorified , " he told TIME Reporter James Simon in an interview , " but I do n't want to be vilified either . " To prove that the press attacks are undeserved , he produced a thick file of testimonials ; he read from a speech by one federal judge who praised him as " warm at heart and a gentleman of character . " Another judge interprets Hoffman 's self-advertisements as " a search for reassurance . " He says : " I think that underneath Judge Hoffman 's appearance there is a deep concern and striving to be worthy of the power he possesses . " <P> The son of a furrier , Julius Jennings Hoffman grew up in Chicago , graduated from Northwestern University Law School and went into corporate practice . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled what became the Brunswick Corp. , which makes bowling alleys and other products . He served as the company 's counsel until he was elected a state circuit-court judge in 1947 . A generous supporter of the Republican Party , he became the first Jew on the federal bench in the Northern Illinois district when President Eisenhower appointed him in 1953 . <P> Illinois lawyers respect Hoffman for legal knowledge and craftsmanship . Last year he upheld the Government 's first suit to desegregate a Northern school district . In his decision , which involved the Chicago suburb of South Holland , <P> Hoffman eloquently described desegregation as " a very small down payment on an investment whose dividends are good citizenship , justice and the welfare of the nation . " The judge proudly notes that his words were quoted " around the world-even in the English language newspaper in Jerusalem . "
