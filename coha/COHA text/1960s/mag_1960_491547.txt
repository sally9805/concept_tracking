The airline pilots saw it when it first began-a dozen years ago . Flying by night out of Boston , northward toward Portland , Maine , and south to Providence , New York , Philadelphia , Baltimore and Washington , they watched the dark land between the cities come alive with the lights of homes and shops and factories . The face of America was changing . Out of the angers and dissatisfactions of millions of people , out of their hopes and dreams and aspirations , Megalopolis  --  the " Great City " ? was being born . It started slowly in the first years , for cars were hard to come by just after the war , and this was a mass migration that could only be supported by the automobile . First the cities began to send out thin fingers of light along the radial highways , poking deeper and deeper into the empty hinterland . Soon , though , this pattern changed . As Detroit performed its miracle of production , starfish clusters of light began to form along all the rural roads that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clusters grew and ran together and multiplied and spread , until the overflow from one central city began to blend and merge with that of another many miles away . The cities , somebody said , were like huge bonfires , sending out sparks that fell at random to light new fires in the surrounding dark . Somebody else , less poetic , saw the whole Northeastern Seaboard as a giant panful of fried eggs whose whites spread until they touched . The lights of Boston flowed north and west toward Lowell and Lawrence . Springfield and Hartford reached out groping fingers for each other . New York , hemmed in by its rivers , sent a tide flowing up the valley of the Hudson . Philadelphia spread north toward Trenton and south toward Wilmington . Baltimore and Washington began to blend into one great urban region , and Washington 's population spilled southward over the Potomac , deep into the once rural counties of Virginia . A few thousand real-estate men knew what was happening , and a few hundred builders , and all the bulldozer drivers who were scraping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form the raw , red , flat places where the huge subdivisions , the shopping centers and the factories were to stand . For a long time , though , the sociologists and the geographers , the economists and the demographers , the political scientists and the ecologists who study the human animal in relation to his environment , paid little attention to the great change that was going on under their noses . CONTINUED ON PAGE 1$ CONTINUED FROM PAGE 13 For the past two years , however , they have paid little attention to anything else . A special census taken in 1957 gave statistical confirmation to what was already known by every airline passenger who had taken the trouble to look out of the window of his plane . Americans were no longer living where they used to live , nor working where they used to work . Great human tides , made up of white middle-income Americans , were flowing out of the cities into the rural hinterlands . Into the cities , to take their place , dark tides were running  --  of Puerto Ricans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been restless and mobile had suddenly become as fluid as quicksilver . Today dozens of brilliant and learned men who are concerned with human behavior in all its cultural , social , economic and political aspects , arc studying Megalopolis with the concentration of a physicist probing the heart of an atom , trying to find out what triggered the great explosion and what , if anything , can be done to guide , direct and control it . Wilfred Owen of Brookings Institution ; Paul Ylvisaker of the Ford Foundation ; Harvey Perloff of Resources for the Future ; William Wheaton of the University of Pennsylvania ; Ray Vernon of Harvard ; and Jean Gottman of Princeton Institute for Advanced Study  --  the brilliant French geographer who gave Megalopolis its name  --  to name only a few , are writing books , lecturing and haranguing one another endlessly in seminars , trying to explain what is happening and what it will mean to America in years to come . They all agree that the great shift in population is not confined to the Northeastern Seaboard alone , though there it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America touches blue water , and in some inland areas , the same thing is taking place . From Chicago eastward to Detroit , Cleveland and Buffalo , along the shores of the Great Lakes an urban region is spreading that before the century is out may meet the westward-running tide that is flowing up the Hudson and Mohawk valleys . Another is forming from Cleveland to east of Pittsburgh , another along the Gulf Coast ; and on the Pacific the open space between San Francisco and San Diego is swiftly filling in . As our great inland resources of iron and oil and lead and timber begin to dwindle , there is a drift toward the deep-water harbors where future foreign imports will come in . They know now what is happening . They do not yet comprehend all its implications . CONTINUED ON PAGE 7.1 74 When the present airs . Giesler and l were married , we had very little The depression was in full swing , and had financial obligations arising out of my divorce . I 'll never forget one night m hen 1 took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money for one order of fish . Fortunately , hard rolls were served free , and the bus boy served two pats of butter . I ordered one order of lino of sole , and I hat , with the rolls and butler , was our dinner . But we 've had a lot of fun together . e 've never had dull times  --  at least I have n't . We are opposite types . I 'm quiet and reserved . She loses gaiety . But at Ones our marriage has been trying to Mrs. Giesler , who occasionally remarks that I not only am married to her but also to my work . Being it wise and reasonable wife , she does n't say that resentfully . She mentions it as an established fact , and she puts up with things other wives wouldn't. such as not having vacations . She gives my morale a tremendous lift by sitting up with me until I go to bed , no matter w hat time it is . I may work on a case until two o'clock or four o'clock in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had as little as two hours ' sleep during the night , but she 's always there to see if there 's anything she can do for my comfort or to give me a fight talk if I need one . One night while I was preparing for the third Busby Berkeley trial , I thought , " It 's too hard . I ca n't do it . " Without realizing it , I said those things out loud as 1 paced the floor . " What ca n't you do ? " my wife asked me . " You can do anything if you put your mind to it . You 've won harder cases . Impossible cases . " True or not , it gave me the courage 1 needed . When the Alexander Pantages case was over , we moved a little closer to easy street . After the Pantages trial , I got more important cases , and we moved from our flat to a beautiful apartment at Sycamore and Beverly . Mrs. Giesler did the decorating , and it was exquisite . From there we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There we put in our first swimming pool . That house , however , was too big . By that time we had two children , but even four of us rattled around . Our answer was to buy the one we live in now , which is more manageable . Mrs. Giesler decorated my law She has a knack for doing such things . My office has a quiet muted atmosphere , enhanced by dark green walls and pinpoint spotlights concealed in the ceiling . She had a small photograph of Mr , Darrow and a small photograph of Mr. Rogers both enlarged and matted and framed to harmonize with each other . Then she hung them on the wall behind me , so that I appear between their two likenesses . If you talk to her , she 'll tell you that I have certain pluses and minuses , One plus is that I have infinite patience . " But when it conies to business matters , not so good , " she 'll soy . " I 'm his business manager . He needs one . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy mark . She tells a story to prove she 's right . One night the front doorbell rang . Mrs. Giesler and I were propped up in bed watching television . She put on her robe , went to the front door , opened the peephole in it and asked , " What is it ? " A man 's voice asked . " Is Jerry home ? " " You mean Mr. Giesler ? " she asked . " What is it in reference to ? " " I must see him , " the man said . " It 's important . " " I 'm sorry , " Mrs. Giesler said , " but Mr. Giesler does n't see anyone on Saturdays and Sundays . You 'll have to call him at his office Monday morning . " But the man was persistent . He kept saying , " It 's very urgent . I have to see him , " and Mrs. Giesler kept saying , " I 'm sorry , but you ca n't . " Finally the man said , " I 'll go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . " He did go over to the hotel and he did call me . He said that he was desperately in need of money , and he asked if I would lend him a little to tide him over . What burned Mrs. Giesler was that I 'd never seen the fellow in my life . He 'd gotten my address from the phone book . But although I knew nothing about him , I was softhearted enough to say I would lend him money . When Mrs. Giesler heard me say that , she excused herself and disappeared  --  downstairs . was fumbling in my pockets to see how much cash I could find when the doorbell rang . Mrs. Giesler went to the door and said through the peephole , " What do you think this is , a loan company ? Get out of here fast or I 'll call the police ! And it takes the Beverly Hills police only two minutes to get here ! " Our maid saw the stranger run like a deer past the kitchen window . The thought that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never even heard of before is one Mrs. Giesler wo n't let me forget in a hurry . " If you 're that soft , " she told me , " I 'll make a few touches around here myself . " Mrs. Giesler has been a help to me in many other ways too . I used her as a mobile model in trying to work out in my mind just how things had happened in a case that another lawyer had tried and lost . I was asked to retry IL It involved an Italian triangle . My Italian client was charged with murder . He was charged with killing his wife and her lover when became home and found them in the bedroom . The husband shot the man as he went through a door . A bullet killed his wife as she tried to get out through the same door . T It I was n't worried about defending my client for shooting the lover he had found in his own bed with his wife . There is no law which permits shooting under such circumstances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as extreme provocation . But when it comes to shooting a wife under the same circumstances  --  well , juries are apt to be more difficult . It was my client 's story that his wife had been hit by one of the bullets he had fired at the fleeing homewrecker . The only thing wrong with his story was that she had fallen facing her husband . At home with Mrs. Giesler , I tried to reenact that scene in the way my client said it had happened . Hour after hour I placed my wife by a door , took a gun  --  unloaded , of course  --  pointed it at her , and had her try to go through the door ; then I pretended to fire . Finally it came to me . What had happened was the same thing that happens when a hunter hits a deer with a high-powered rifle . If you hit a deer in the shoulder when it 's running away from you , the force of the bullet is apt to spin him around . When her husband 's bullet had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into the room , facing him . When 1 used one of my associates to demonstrate this in the courtroom for the jury , they found the husband not guilty . I have been said by the press to " dress well , " whatever that means . If that is true , it 's because Mrs. Giesler selects my clothes . She has a tailor come to our house for fittings , and she chooses the fabrics . She even buys my shoes . I take her word for these things . She insists on laying out at night the clothes that I 'm going to wear the next morning , including my shirt and tie , and she does all my mending . The truth is , she takes care of me like a baby . She wo n't like my talking this way . She does n't want any credit for being a help to me . But I want to give her her due . She deserves it . There was a time when I 'd answer my phone anytime , day or night . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone needs me for something really important , she does n't object , but most of the people who call merely want to chew the fat about a case , or they are worried or nervous and they want someone to soothe them . Mrs. Giesler has a system to help me get a few hours ' rest when such calls come . She answers the telephone and says , " I 'm S AT tilt DAY ft VF , N I N ri 1 . ( 1ST sorry , I 'm a maid in the household , but I 've been given instructions not to awaken Mr. Giesler . " She says she can always tell whether it 's really urgent or not . If it 's not , she says , " You can call him in the morning at his office , after nine o'clock . " Most of the time they never call , and she says , " You see ! They 're just people who /magined they needed you . " The few times I 've tried to take a vacation I 've been unhappy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm never out of touch with my office . If I 'm in New York , 1 call my office at least twice a day and ask my secretary , Mrs. Fitzpatrick , to read me the mail or tell me what telephone calls have come in . One year my wife persuaded me to go to Palm Springs with her . She thought that / should cut myself off from my office and have a complete rest . After making sure that it had no telephone , she rented a house near the springs . I tried to fall in with her idea , but I could n't stand it . Somehow I managed to get into Palm Springs three or four times a day to call my office . The Friday before Easter I called Mrs. Fitzpatrick and said , " I wish you 'd drive down here and bring my mail and any messages . " When she arrived , I said , " You 'd better stay over the weekend . 1 think I 'll drive back with you Monday . " With me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness . I 've been asked if I ever plan to retire . Mrs. Giesler puts it this way : " Every once in a while Jerry says that he might retire someday and take it easy ; but I do n't really believe it , not him ! " 1 talk about taking it easier , but since I 've tried to be honest all through this story , I 'll be honest to the very end . Mrs. Giesler is right . I do not plan to retire . I plan to die with my shoes on  --  preferably in a courtroom  --  but I may not be that lucky , There are people who are silly enough to sty to act as their own lawyers in acriminal court . As a youngster I was in court one day when one of those do-it-myself defenders was having his day in the sun . The judge was patiently waiting to sentence him , but the defendant had spent the morning making motion after motion , although they had all been denied . Finally , it neared noon and the judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I pronounce sentence ? " " Yes , " the defendant said hurriedly . " Your honor , I move we adjourn . " Even the judge laughed . He could n't help it . But he did n't adjourn . He proceeded with the sentencing . Right now I feel the way that self-appointed defender must have felt , and on my own behalf I 'll say , as he said , " I move we adjourn . " This is the last or eight articles by Mr. Giesler . ? THE EETTOR9 Our Urban Revolution They argue whether it is good or bad , and they seem to agree that a change so overwhelming can not bring with it human happiness and content so long as it remains as it is now  --  formless , chaotic and unplanned . Even the phroces they use to describe it express their doubts . The word " megalopolis " itself does not fall pleasantly on the ear , and " conurbation , " the word the British use to describe the same phenomenon of growth , is even uglier . They speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " scatteraLion . " They refer to the " fragmentation " and the " Balkanization " of local gov ( Continued from Page 15 ) ernments , and to the " blight " and the " gray areas " that surround the cores of cities as their most intelligent and productive citizens move out . They find their misgivings shared by the populace in general . When they mention Megalopolis at a cocktail party , a blank look at first comes over the listener 's face . When they go on to explain that by this they mean the great strip city of nearly 30,000,000 people that is beginning to spread for 600 miles along a narrow belt of Northeast Coast , from north of Boston to south of Washington , the confused expression changes to a look of consternation . The inevitable reaction is : What a horrible prospect ! Ca n't something be done to stop it ? Upon this one point all the students of Megalopolis are agreed . It is a horrible prospect , and nothing can be done to stop it . The flight from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run its course . It began when the first automobile went chugging down a dirt road past the end of the streetcar line , Two wars and a great depression delayed it , but the pressures that had been building up for fifty years inevitably had to find release , All that was needed to set off the great explosion was the prospect of a few years of prosperity and peace . That time arrived at the end of World War II . Since then , the cities have been like dying stars , sending out great coronas of flame and energy while swiftly cooling around the central core . What we are witnessing now , they say , and will continue to witness for several generations to come , barring another depression or atomic war , is one of the great migrations in human history , a revolution in land use which destroys forever the old patterns of human habitation . The ( Continued on Page 78 ) 78 tfontinuni from Nee 741 classic concept of the metropolis as a central city ringed by its beitroom suburbs and satellite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and toward which all men 's thoughts were turned-110 longer has any validity . The old metropolis thinned at the periphery , but its boundaries were clear cut . Framed by fields and woodlands and empty space , it was a definite and definable spot upon the earth . Now fields and uoodlands and open space are rapidly disappearing . And the " Standard Metropolitan Area " of the old census definition -- -a city of 50,000 or more with its contiguous suburbs  --  has spread and sprawled into an " urban region , " whose farflung inhabitants may look to one or many cities , or to none , as a focal point of culture , industry and commerce . The citizen of Philadelphia , moving into Bucks County , may return to work or shop or visit friends . He is equally likely to be drawn into the orbit of Trenton to the north , or Burlington . New Jersey , to the east . Or he may ignore them all and find his job , his friends and all the goods and services he needs within Bucks County itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a magnet , is losing its pulling power . Dirty , noisy , choked with traffic , it is no longer an efficient place in which to work , nor a pleasant place in which to live . There are those , of course , who will deny this denigration of the city and will rebuke such statements bitterly . One of them is Mr. Robert Moses , who for a generation has carried on a one-man crusade to make his home city of New York grander and more beautiful . A master of the jeremiad , Mr. Moses paraphrases Jeremiah and describes all doubters and naysayers as " wild jackassaa braying in the wilderness of their own confusion . " The city will survive as long as our civilization survives , says Mr. Moses , and the outpouring of its citizens into the countryside is a demonstration not of the city 's weakness but of its boundless vitality . It is carrying out its ancient destiny of growth . No scholar , nor anyone else in his right mind , wishes to be drawn into public debate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in which to work and live , for his gift of eloquent invective is too well known . They merely answer , mildly , if the city still is the seat and center of all human interests and activities , why are so many millions of people leaving it so fast ? And why are they trying to move so far away from it ? This suggests that , though men have lived in cities since the days of Tyre and Sidon , they never really wanted to live there in the first place . Except in those Asiatic countries where by habit and tradition the home and the place of work are housed together , men have always tried to live removed from the central market place , and they have used each new means of transportation as it came along to accomplish their escape . The city of the walking man and the horse-drawn buggy was a tiny place . The city of the streetcar spread wider , and the commuter train scattered the well-to-do far out into the countryside . The city as a market place had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the river port or the railhead was there : and these were the routes over which goods were transported . But the people moved as technology gave them the means to move , and the downtown mansions of the wealthy became the slums that housed the poor . Today , the students of Megalopolis point out , not even the city as a center of trade and industry has to stay in its old fixed spot . Just as the automobile gave the clerk and the factory hand , as well as the boss , the privilege of living as far away from his work its he cared to ride each day , the giant truck gave industry an equal mobility . The great migration that is tilling up the space between the cities is not , therefore , a movement of people only . It is a movement of industry as well . Factories , no longer tied to ports and harbors and railroad junctions , can be set up wherever the highways run and the cloverleaf of the great expressway will become the center of the sprawling city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have shown that for many industries it is cheaper to be near the market than to the source of raw materials . As the people moved , therefore , the factories followed . And as the factories moved , after them came their wholesalers and distributors . Shops and stores and offices sprang up where once were empty fields , and little suburbs that started out as quiet bedroom communities soon found , to their consternation , that they were becoming embryonic cities , afflicted with all the problems of noise , dirt , crowding and confusion which the happy emigres to the country thought they had left behind them forever . The citizens of Lazy Acres felt a vast sense of well-being when they peered out their picture windows , across their tiny , struggling lawns , toward the rolling green hills where dairyman Witherspoon grazed his cows . Disenchantment soon set in , however , when they woke up one morning to hear the bulldozers growling and snorting , leveling the green pastures for a factory , a shopping center or another subdivision whose picture windows would stare directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a concrete carpet over the hills between them and the grammar school , its nearest crossing ten miles down the road . Disillusionment grew when the lawn turned into a reeking quagmire and they found that septic tanks just do n't work very well when set in certain types of soil ; or when the deep-drilled well ran dry because there was n't enough water underground to serve 500 clean-living families who liked to take a bath every day ; or when the school people sent a note to say that , with the opening of the new subdivision down the road , the grammar school would have to go on double session , which fouled up mamma 's car-pool driving arrangements sorely . The list could go on and on , but it serves to illustrate the weakness that lies at the heart of Megalopolis  --  the unplanned , unpredictable , to-hell-with-tomorrow haphazardness of . the sprawling growth , Here and there , of course , a few trained planners , a handful of enlightened builders , an occasional old community trying to avoid being inundated by the tidal wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope will save some open space , keep the air clean and the water pure and plentiful , and hold the population at a level of density the community can support without mortgaging its future forever for new schools , water mains , firehouses and sewer lines . Such farsighted men and municipalities are rare , however , and the voice of the planner , begging plaintively that a little green space be left for parks , a few acres set aside for schools , churches and community centers , has been drowned in the clank of the bulldozer and the bang of the carpenters ' hammers . The pressures of population have been too great . The surge to the suburbs is motivated by emotions as strong and deep as those which sent the pioneer wagons rolling westward a century ago . It also has been about as poorly planned and as destructive of scarce natural resources , The pioneer went westward seeking land of his own and elbow room . In finding it and making it his own , he slaughtered the forests and destroyed the fertility of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suburbs , seeks the same things ; and in finding them and making them his own , he is prodigally wasteful of our rapidly dwindling resources of pleasant vistas and of unsullied open space . Under the streets and rooftops of suburbia , a million acres of rural land arc being buried every year  --  much of it the best farm and orchard land the nation owns . The result , the planners and thinkers say , can only be eventual chaos  --  an endless jungle of poles , wires , asphalt and television aerials stretching away to the horizon under a smog-filled sky in a disorderly sprawl , with never a park or a woodland to break the ugliness and monotony . This has happened already in many places ; and it eventually will happen ev-erywhere , as the rush to the outlying lands becomes stronger in the years ahead . The great migration that has already taken place , the census analysts point out , was based on a relatively thin segment of the population . The sparse baby crop of the ' 30 's was just beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 's , and it is they who have filled the countryside with homes . The huge baby crop of the ' 40 's is just now reaching the family-forming stage , and the millions of babies born in the even more fecund ' 50 's will be moving into the country far into the ' 70 's  --  if there is any country left to move into by then . There are only two things , the planners and prophets say , which could keep this unhappy prospect from becoming a more unhappy reality . One would be some great change in our national fortunes , or our attitudes , that would stop the migration altogether . Another would be a vast program of intelligent planning which could guide and control future use of the land in such a way that growth would be orderly , and at least some of the basic amenities would be preserved . Neither seems likely to come to pass any time soon . So far , no Moses has appeared who could lead the children of Megalopolis out of the wilderness which they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under which the migration might be halted or diminished . Up to now it has been fed by two counterfl owing streams  --  the outward flow from the cities to the suburban fringe and the inward flow from the rural areas and the little towns to a metropolitan middle ground which is neither city nor country , but partially both . The old definition of the city dweller as a country boy who moved to the city to work like a dog to make enough money to move back to the country no longer applies . Today he moves from the farm or the little town to a suburban ranch house , where the smoke from his back-yard barbecue grill blends with that of his neighbor who came from the city . That trend could change . The great migration that saw 13,000,000 people move from the farm to the urban regions between 1940 and 1957 was set off by new technologies  --  mechanized farming , new and better seeds and fertilizers  --  which released millions of hands for work in offices or the service trades . Today 7,000,000 farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dismay of the taxpayers who must subsidize this glut and to the harassment of Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson , who must try to dispose of it , As population increases , though , and more good farm ! and is buried under the concrete of great highways , the asphalt of parking lots and the rooftops of suburban houses , our excess of foods and fibers may change to scarcity . By 1975 , when the census people anticipate that we will have a population of 220,000,000 , it may be possible that the farmer 's son will find it more profitable to stay on the land and work it , rather than to seek a job in industry . A drastic change in population growth could also alter the pattern of the future . In every projection made so far , the population of 1975 exceeds 200,000,000 . If people have babies in the next fifteen years at the rate they were having them in 1940 to 1942 , the population will stand at 207,000,000 . If they have them at the 1954-55 rate , the figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere around 220,000,000 . The census analysts know very well , however , that in making these projections they are on dangerous ground . They remember with embarrassment the error they fell into in the ' 30 's , when they assumed that the low fertility rate of that time would continue , and they foresaw a population leveling off at around 150 , x10,000 by 1955 and declining thereafter . They know that they now may be as overly optimistic as they were pessimistic then . " Anybody who tries to predict what the child-bearing habits of the American people will be in any future decade , " said Prof. Philip Hauser of the University of Chicago , " is either a fool or a charlatan . All we can safely say is , ' If what is happening now continues , the result will be such and such . ' " If the present prosperity continues , the population projections may prove conservative enough , for the growth patterns of past decades show that fertility rates are directly related to employment and income , A great depression  --  even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the urban regions , for in tirnt.s of economic trouble marriages fall off . Young bachelors and maidens remain in their city apartments , postponing their dream of marrying and buying a little house in the suburbs until things pick up again . At the moment there is a certain uneasinacs in the air , but the prospect of depression still seems remote . Young men arc still finding jobs that enable them to support a wife ; and all over the country , sextons are getting calluses from tolling wedding bells . In the event of atomic war , of course , no predictions would have any validity . For the moment , though , global war seems no nearer than it ever has since the end of the last one . There are some sociologists , in fact , who believe that strengthening prospects of peace would have the effect of slowing down the metropolitan sprawl . The flight to the suburbs , they contend , has been stimulated by an instinct for survival , by a desire  --  subconscious perhaps , but compelling  --  to get away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell on Hiroshima , some ancient wisdom whispered that the city in the future would be no place for a prudent man to live , If the time should evercome when the headsof stateagreed to outlaw the bomb , and men believed them , the outflow from the city would diminish , lhere are other conditions , all of them unpleasant , which might slow down the spread of Megalopolis . The urban fringes may , in time , become too costly for many of the low-middle-income people who now are flocking there . Suburban taxes are rising . Land is cheaper in the suburbs , but the cost of building a house there is going up faster than incomes arc rising . Many outlying areas already arc beginning to choke in their own traffic ; and for many a commuter the ride to work is becoming depressingly long and tedious . None of these things now , or in any foreseeable time to come , is likely to halt or even greatly diminish the tides of migration that arc so strongly flowing . In the words of Dr. Luther Gulick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will go right on . The drift from the soil to the city will go right on . The economic advantages of industrialism will not abate .. . . Thus the great sprawling urban regions , the metropolitan complexes , will go right on growing , and their problems will he bigger and worse and more demanding . " Most of these problems are physical and apparent , and the outlying communities can solve them in time if they are willing to pay the price . When all the wells go dry , the community can set up its own water system  --  or buy high-priced water at retail from some older municipality nearby . When the septic tanks overflow , municipal sewer lines can be laid out , with the householders bearing the cost  --  though howls of protest may arise from the neighboring community down the road , which does not like having sewage dumped into the stream that ( lows into its recreation lake . Schools can be expanded , and policemen and firemen hired . But all these things cost money . The first moment of disillusionment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill . One of the reasons he went to the suburbs in the first place was that tax rates were lower there than in the city . He finds out they were lower because the suburban municipality did not provide the services that the city he had left provided . And when he starts demanding these services , the costs leave him stunned . He had paid for them in the city , too , of course ; but painlessly , for they were hidden in his rent bill . These arc the householders ' problems , though , and somehow he will work them out . Of equal interest to the men who study Megalopolis arc the great intangibles , the still unanswered question of what the metropolitan sprawl is doing to America socially , culturally , economically and politically . There are those who contend that the spread of suburbia is stultifying the American mind . Great cities , they point out , arc centers of intellectual ferment where the finest talents congregate , and mind strikes sparks from mind . There is stimulation there in the great libraries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new suburbs , on the other hand , are , to resurrect Mr. Mencken 's old epithet , Saharas of the Bozarts  --  vast expanses of intellectual sterility where the only mental stimulus , if it can be described as stimulus , comes from the television screen . Other , more pragmatic , men point out that the man who spends a pleasant Saturday puttering with his petunias , or mowing the lawn , or building a boat in his garage , or sitting with a beer before the television set , watching a baseball game , is living as he likes to live . Hewould n't be peering at old masters in a museum , or attending musicales even if they were available . The homogeneity of the suburbs is of concern to some . Here , they point out , there is none of the great variety of human types , old and young , rich and poor , native and foreign , who jostle each other on the city 's streets and , by their very presence , make of each city dweller a cosmopolitan . In every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families much alike in age , in income , education and attitudes ; and this , it is held , makes for dullness and conformity . It also , it would seem , makes for a fairly happy and tractable neighborhood in which each man lives at peace with the man next door . This homogeneity , particularly of age , does have its disadvantages however . In some suburbs there arc hundreds of babies  --  and no teen-age baby sitters . In others there are hundreds of teen-agers eager to earn pocket money  --  and no babies with whom to sit . In some areas adjacent to the great cities of the North , the homogeneity is not only of age and income but of race and religion . The residents are predominantly Italian or Jewish or Irish or Middle European . Thus the old patterns of the ghetto  --  the Little Italys , the Little Erins , the Little Polands of immigrant days  --  are being reproduced in sylvan surroundings . This , the sociologists believe , is a fragmentation of America that should be deplored  --  a defeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are even more concerned by the fact that the outlying areas are predominantly white , while the central cities grow darker every year . The European immigrant of years gone by had little trouble taking on the manners and mores of the indigenous population , for the native was there for him to observe and emulate . With the white population fleeing the city , leaving the Negro and the Puerto Rican behind , there is small chance for the newcomer to absorb the culture patterns of the metropolis . Political scientists ponder the effect this separation of people along racial and economic lines will have on the future of the two great political parties . Cities have been traditionally Democratic and will likely remain so as their lower-income citizens increase in numbers . In the two-party slates , the old well-to-do suburbs and the rural areas have been traditionally Republican . Will the city Democrat cling to his old loyalties when he moves to the suburbs and becomes a property owner ? Or will he shift his allegiance to the G.O.P. ? The next national election should provide some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has had a tremendously stimulating effect not only upon the building trades but upon the whole economy . The mover to the suburbs must have a car , and whenever he can afford it he owns two . His new status creates all sorts of new demands for goods and services associated with outdoor living  --  for garden tools and power mowers , grass seeds and fertilizers and lawn furniture and barbecue grills , and casual clothes of a different type from those he wore in the city . The result has been a great upsurge in retail sales in which the city , for all its efforts to lure the shopper back downtown , has had trouble getting its share . As a result the great downtown department stores have had to join the hegira , setting up branches in the hinterlands which , in effect , compete with the mother store . All the above leads finally to the question which troubles all those who ponder the long-range effects of Megalopolis . With its tax values falling , with many of its best and brightest citizens leaving it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crumble slowly into decay , becoming at best an island of office buildings surrounded by a gray sea of slums ? Or will it use its concentrated wealth and brains to light the forces that would destroy it , and arise more vital , more magnetic and more magnificent than before ?
