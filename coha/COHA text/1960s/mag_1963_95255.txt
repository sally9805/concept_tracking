I always heard that horse racing was the sport of kings and now I know . I have to confess that it is far too rich for my plebeian blood . // You may have heard of a filly named Nubile . At Aqueduct on July 6 she dared to run against the great Cicada and was beaten by only a neck . Next Saturday at Delaware Park , Nubile will run in the New Castle Stakes . The following Saturday , July 27 , she will run in the Delaware Handicap , the richest race in the world for female horses . If she should win these two  --  and you have to give her a chance off her record  --  she could earn $156,000 in eight days . // Would n't you like to own her ? Unless you happen to be a king , do n't answer too fast . I own her  --  and , being just a commoner , I 'm not sure I like it at all . // Every horseplayer dreams of some day owning a racehorse , and I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of having a stakes horse , and I have been an owner for six years . Nubile is my dream come true , the fulfillment of all my ambitions . I should be delirious with joy . I should be singing from morning till night . Am I delirious ? No . Am I singing ? No . What am I ? I 'm worried , that 's what . // Owning horses used to be fun . I started with a $4,000 mare named Wedding Ring . The trainer who helped me buy her assured me that I could n't possibly lose , since she was worth more than that as a broodmare even if she never won a race . She immediately won a $950 purse at Florida 's Sunshine Park . Then she ran third at Delaware Park , and my delight knew no bounds . // As all too often happens in horse racing , Wedding Ring went lame . Lame , schmame . All I had to do was sell her as a broodmare and start over with another horse . But again , as so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nobody wanted to buy her as a broodmare . I tried to give her away in return for her first foal . Still no takers . So I found myself forced into the breeding business . I put her on a Kentucky farm and bred her to a young and untried stallion named Distillate  --  not so much because of his bloodlines , though his bloodlines were spectacular , but because at that stage of his career he was free . // When the veterinarian said Wedding Ring was in foal , the hope that springs almost eternal in the horseplayer 's breast started to spring once more . Perhaps Wedding Ring had been a bad investment as a racehorse , but now she would drop a fine big colt that would put my stable in the black . // With my luck being what it was , she dropped not a colt but a filly . I named her Nubile , which was another mistake . I thought it was generally known that Nubile is pronounced " nooble " ( to rhyme with ruble ) and means ripely marriageable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to be the world 's most erudite race caller , pronounces it new-beel and seems to feel that it has some sort of connection with the auto industry . // Nubile was fun , though unprofitable , as a 2-year-old . She once worked a half mile in a fast .46 , keeping that hope springing . But she never had enough success to be worrisome , nothing better than fourth . Then last year , in her first start as a 3-year-old , a $6,000 claiming race at Pimlico , she won so easily that , paradoxically , all the fun began to disappear . When you have a cheap horse , you can blithely enter it in claiming races , not caring and sometimes even half hoping that somebody will take it away from you . You can be pleased when it runs fourth and earns $125 , delighted when it runs third and earns $250 , delirious when it runs second and earns $500 and absolutely out of your mind when it wins and earns $1,425 . When you have a good horse , you start to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter it in a $10,000 claimer , lose it  --  then watch it go on to win a couple of hundred thousand for its new owner ? On the other hand , suppose you keep running the horse over its head , never winning even a nickel in purses , until you have broken its heart and destroyed its will to win ? // I figure  --  or I figured then , I 'm not so sure now  --  that if you are in a crazy business like horse racing you should go for broke . I decided to run Nubile in allowance races only , where nobody could take her away . She promptly got beaten nine times in a row . I have two partners who started with a piece of Wedding Ring and thus own a piece of Nubile . You should have heard them grumble. // It was not until last October that Nubile won again . Then she won four in the space of eight weeks , against good company and at distances up to 1 ? miles . I felt great , my judgment vindicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What to do next ? Send her to Santa Anita for the winter , while she was at her peak ? Or rest her up and hope for a really great season in 1963 ? We decided on the rest . With a total lack of appreciation , Nubile got so fat that it was the middle of April before she was ready to compete again . She ran fourth , against mares that were anything but world beaters . // Still , to my eyes , she had that look of eagles . I sent away a check for $250 to enter her in those two big races at Delaware , and some other checks for handicaps at Aqueduct and in New Jersey . What with these stakes fees and the training bills , all the profits she had made in the last few months of 1962 began to melt away . Soon I was having dreams where I was hauled before a judge and asked to explain how I had managed to show no profit whatever with a horse that was better than at least 90% of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this filly . I have spent a lot of time with her in training hours , and I can tell just by walking her once around the barn how she feels . If she jumps in the air every time she turns a corner and tries to shake me off the other end of the shank , she 's happy . If she merely plods along , she is depressed . When she is depressed she wo n't eat enough oats to keep up her strength unless you cut up carrots real fine and mix them in . I have cut up hundreds of carrots for her , which is more than I have done for my wife . // In the paddock before a race , she stands absolutely still , not nervous , not washy like many fillies . Once her trainer , Rein Vandernat , has tightened the saddle girth , she turns her head my way so that I can put her blinkers on . I always know she will do her best . She has not won in nine starts this year , but she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year since she failed to finish at least as close as fourth . // Still , how can anybody not a king stand this kind of excitement ? Personally , I have always had to work for a living . I started in the Depression , my first year 's salary was $825 , and large sums of money make me nervous . On July 6 at Aqueduct , first place was worth $12,622 more than second place . If the race had been five feet longer , Nubile would have been first instead of second . I felt proud of her , ecstatic  --  and also a little sick . This Saturday the difference between first money and second will be around $30,000 and next week around $95,000 . What if I have to live through a photo finish then ? // I may not even go near the two big Delaware races . If somebody made me an offer , I might even sell Nubile  --  and simultaneously shed a tear and heave a sigh of relief . These pains in my stomach tell me that what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse who would have a chance for one of those $950 pots at Sunshine Park . Then I could start to enjoy racing again .
