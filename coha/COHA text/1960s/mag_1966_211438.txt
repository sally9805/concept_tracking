PUBLIC POLICY <P> Until 18 months ago , Leo Carter 's job was to sweep , mop and polish the floors at Miami Beach 's St. Francis Hospital . Today , as proprietor of The Best Floor Waxing Service , he is an entrepreneur with six employees . Mexican-born Joe Garcia , on relief in Manhattan eight months ago , now takes in about $240 a week as the operator of a midtown newsstand . David Flowers , who had to give up his job as a house painter after he injured his back in an auto crash , has become the owner of a thriving eight-pump , seven-employee service station on Chicago 's South Side . <P> Easy Terms . For all three men , the Federal Government supplied the funds that enabled them to start their own businesses . With finances too meager for them to qualify for ordinary bank loans , they borrowed their capital on easier terms ( 51% interest , up to 15 years to repay ) than many a blue-chip corporation could arrange amid today 's tight-money pinch . The loans came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1964 antipoverty law , which aims at helping the poor in depressed neighborhoods to become self-employed and to put struggling little firms on a sounder footing . To that end , SBA has just raised the maximum loan from $15,000 to $25,000-the level where it was until 13 months ago . <P> Relying mostly on character instead of credit to judge who should get its largesse , the SBA in 22 months has lent $25,281,230 to 2,475 borrowers in 44 communities . Though defaults have come to 3.4% of that total as compared with a mere 0.2% in commercial bank lending , the agency calls itself " pleasantly surprised " that the record is not worse . Even so , some critics complain that the SBA has taken some mighty peculiar risks . A service station folded because the owner was n't around enough to keep track of the operation . A small manufacturer of plastics and draperies failed because he priced his products below cost . Even though he had undergone one bankruptcy before , Chicago Taxi Driver Lawrence Young persuaded the SBA to lend him $19,500 to launch a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent that the agency lost $14,000 even after auctioning the fixtures for $5,000 . Young , now working as a janitor , blames his misfortune partly on his failure to attend the SBA 's free courses on how to run a business . <P> A Problem of Confidence . Nearly a fifth of the SBA 's loans so far have been made in the New York City area , helping hundreds of formerly long-term unemployed relief recipients to become owners of beauty parlors , record shops , Laundromats , and even small factories . The big problem , says Sidney Shiff , executive director of the New York Small Business Development Center , which screens and funnels loan applications to the SBA , is to " give people the self-confidence to go into business for themselves . You ca n't start big , with grand programs . But when neighbors see that somebody 's made it with a new store , they 'll try harder . " SBA Administrator Bernard Boutin vows to try harder too . As a start , he has ordered his staff to " go out into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the potential to run a business .
