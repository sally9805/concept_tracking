CRYOBIOLOGY <P> James H. Bedford , 73 , a retired psychology professor dying of cancer , in Glendale , Calif. , had decided years ago that he wanted his body preserved by freezing for later revival if possible . He had left $4,200 for a steel capsule and for liquid nitrogen to keep his body frozen at about 200 below zero centigrade . When Bedford died on Jan. 12 , his physician , Dr. B. Renault Able , began to pack the body in ice . Members of the Cryonics Society of California arrived to help . They spent eight hours , sending out periodically for more ice , getting the body frozen solid . They used artificial respiration and external heart massage to protect the brain from oxygen-loss damage until it was frozen , drained out the blood and replaced it with antifreeze solutions . Then Professor Bedford 's icy body was flown to Phoenix , where Edward Hope , a wigmaker by trade , waited with the capsule he had designed and put the professor 's remains in liquid-nitrogen storage . <P> Dim Prospects . Underlying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer are discovered , Bedford 's body could be thawed out , cured , and restored to healthy life . This hope has been fostered by Robert C. W. Ettinger , a physics teacher at a Michigan junior college , in his book The Prospect of Immortality ( TIME , Sept. 30 ) . <P> The fact is that although some of the lower forms of life , such as bacteria , can survive freezing and thawing , no higher animal can , and certainly not man . Not even a single major human organ can be thus preserved . The National Naval Medical Center , the world 's foremost freeze bank , stores only three types of tissue : corneas , skin , and bone-marrow cells . Frozen red blood cells and sperm will also keep for months or years . It is not for want of trying that researchers have failed to preserve whole organs , for a frozen-kidney bank would be invaluable to transplantation surgeons . <P> All freezing results in the formation of ice crystals . Some water to make the ice is drawn from inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the water freezes , its dissolved salts are expelled . The permeability of cell membranes is altered ; capillaries are injured ; countless enzyme systems are ruined . Much of the damage may not develop until the organ is thawed . <P> Organs &; Cells . If organs are removed from an animal 's body , they can be flushed out with antifreeze solutions to reduce the ice-crystal damage . Kidneys treated in this way have survived 24 hours of freezing and then recovered part , but not all , of their function when reimplanted in the same animal . <P> The University of Virginia 's Surgeon Leslie E. Rudolf has tried a number of variations , including supercooling with DMSO , under different oxygen pressures , to reduce the cell 's metabolism . Dr. Rudolf believes that ways of reducing the metabolism still further may provide the key to preservation of a single whole organ . Even that comparatively modest achievement , starting with a live organ , still lies in a distant future . The prospect of restoring function to a whole human body , with dozens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought back to life , is even more remote .
