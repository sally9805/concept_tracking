txt // far less than they used to be . The big factors reducing it are better canning practices and the inception of the cold-rolling of steel , a development which , I believe , must be credited to the automobile industry . Nevertheless , the study of corrosion that occurs inside of cans has been a thrilling adventure for me . About the time I joined the Research Laboratories of the National Canners Association , there was issued a weighty report of a study of the corrosion problem in canned foods made by a large committee consisting of representatives of the U.S. Bureau of Chemistry , the American Sheet and Tinplate Company , and the Research Laboratories of the National Canners Association . The one positive recommendation to improve the can , in that report , was that if the steel baseplate could be made with a lower phosphorus content , a better tinplate would result . To understand this , it is necessary to appreciate how tinplate was made at that time . Steel sheets , a few to several on top of each other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then cut into sizes most suitable for making the various sizes of cans . The sheets then had to be annealed in hot ovens , for which they were piled in stacks a few feet high . The hot-rolling and the heat of the ovens caused the sheets to stick together , and unless the phosphorus content was kept below an established maximum , this sticking was so firm that the sheets might be torn in separating them . When cold-rolling of steel for tinplate was adapted to rolling steel in long strips , thousands of feet long , and the strips were passed in a single thickness through the ovens , the phosphorus content could be reduced because there was no longer a sticking problem . After being annealed , the steel sheets were passed through an acid pickling bath to remove any surface oxide of iron , which would interfere with adherence of the tin . The pickled sheets were then passed through pots of molten tin . As they emerged , they were passed between rollers so set as to give the thickness of tin desired . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 1.50 pounds of tin per base box ( 31,360 // square inches ) . Both sides were equally coated . The lowest coating that could be given by this so-called hot-dipping process was designated as 1.25 pounds per base box , called coke plate . Actually , the plate had only about 1.1 pounds per base box . since the rating was based on the amount of tin used and there was always some loss of tin due to oxidation and alloying with iron . This loss was found in the bottom of the tin pot . The thickness of tin with 1.00 pound per base box would be 0.000059 inch . Now , with electrolytic deposition of tin , coatings as low as 0.25 , 0.50 , 0.75 and 1.00 pound per base box are being used in the industry . This has posed the problem of determining which is the most suitable for each product from the standpoint of economy and of the shelf life of the product . Besides reporting this constructive effect of a lower phosphorus content in the base plate , the Tin Plate Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one locality were more corrosive than from another locality , but in another year the behavior of the apples of the two localities might be reversed . In many instances , general corrosion can be greatly minimized by coating the corroding metal with a neutral coating like that of paint on structural materials ? for example , bridge beams . In canning colored fruits and beets , it was found that a so-called enamel coating was necessary to prevent bleaching of the color . One might expect this coating to minimize the corrosion in the can , like the paint on a bridge . The Committee found that , to the contrary , it greatly increased the losses from corrosion . Such were the conditions in the early twenties when I went to my chief , the director of the Research Laboratories of the National Canners Association , to ask him for permission to work on the corrosion problem . This evidently seemed to him a brash request from a young first lieutenant recently out of the Army , with little experience in the canning industry . In refusing , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large committee that had thousands of dollars at its disposal . I reminded him that the committee had studied tinplate . I wanted to study the products that were doing the corroding , // for which I would not need much money , merely a laboratory , a desk and a few chemicals . This did not seem to impress him and his answer was still " No . " I will admit to a bit of stubbornness at times and to wanting my own way . By this time I had made the acquaintance of some important technical men in the two large can companies , American and Continental , which contributed half the budget of the Research Laboratories of the National Canners Association . While this might be classified as going over the head of my superior , I told them I wanted to work on the corrosion problem and solicited their support . I have subsequently found on more than one occasion that seeming disloyalty to superiors is helpful if one is sure it is necessary to get on the right track . Before long , my superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and study corrosion as it occurred in Oregon fruits ? strawberries , cherries , raspberries , and the like . Such colored fruits are always canned in enameled cans . It may he explained here that the so-called enamel is not an enamel but a lacquer baked on at as high a temperature as the tin coating will permit without melting . This gives it an enamel-like finish . Cognizant of the effect of atmospheric oxygen in most corrosion , I first devised a field method to determine the gaseous oxygen in the various fruits . This consisted of two Wolf ( litersized ? about one quart ) flasks , connected with a rubber tube on the glass tubes on the side , near the bottom of each flask , and enough mercury in the flasks to fill one flask . The rubber tube between them had to be long enough so that one flask could be set on the floor while the other was at least 32 inches higher on a table . The flask on the table had a rubber stopper carrying two glass tubes , each with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitable rubber tube and the other to a gas-analyzing apparatus . The flask to be lowered was first raised to fill the flask on the table with mercury and the tube leading to the can-puncturing device with air-free water that I had floating on the mercury . Then the can was punctured and the flask to be set on the floor was lowered ; as the mercury flowed into it , there was created a certain vacuum in the other // flask , sufficient to boil the fruit juice or syrup and withdraw all the gaseous oxygen as well as other gases . Then , by closing the stopcock in the tube leading to the can , opening the one leading to the gas-analyzing apparatus and lifting the flask from the floor , the gas could be transferred to the gas apparatus for analysis . In freshly canned fruits , the gas consisted only of nitrogen , oxygen , and carbon dioxide . Later , when some corrosion had taken place , there would be also hydrogen ? a product of the corrosion . I soon found there was enough oxygen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the corrosion , since I showed that in a can whose volume was 600 cubic centimeters ( 11 pints ) , half a cubic centimeter of oxygen was a material factor in the corrosion . I also demonstrated that the normal respiratory process of these fruits could be adapted to use up this oxygen if given a chance . As a matter of fact , this was already being utilized to some extent in the process of canning , although it was not realized by anyone in the industry . All that was necessary was to augment the respiratory activity , where it was found necessary . This opened a new viewpoint on the corrosion problem , and after my summer 's work on the problem , no one would have wanted to stop my studies . I must digress to pay tribute to two great men in the canning industry . Frank E. Gorrell organized the National Canners Association in 1907 and its Research Laboratories in 1913 . Although he was a lawyer by profession , he had a thorough appreciation of scientific matters . To the time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gorrell was the National Canners Association , so to speak . His title was secretary-treasurer . At that time , H. A. Baker became President of the American Can Company . He had come up through their laboratories and hence had a full appreciation of scientific matters . Mr. Gorrell relied greatly upon Mr. Baker in budgetary matters . When I left the National Canners Association , Mr. Gorrell gave me letters and telegrams that had a bearing on my work . From one telegram from Mr. Baker to Mr. Gorrell , dated April 29 , 1924 , I quote : " Kohman 's perforation work is closely connected with // vitamin study and is worthy of complete investigation . It is along entirely new lines and all previous studies have been only partially effective . I do not know of any work that the Association could carry on that is as promising as the work on vitamins and perforations along the lines suggested by Kohman . " At that time , perforated cans were the outstanding manifestations of corrosion . Pinpoint-size holes actually appeared , mostly in the countersink of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only electrochemical corrosion was involved , hydrogen gas would form at the point where iron was exposed , and in time this would bulge the can ends and make it unsalable . The fruit colors also take up hydrogen and this is the cause of their being bleached . They are therefore classified , among chemists , as hydrogen acceptors . It is appropriate to explain here how the canning process makes use of the respiratory process in fruits to reduce the oxygen in them . After the fruit is placed in the can , it is covered with syrup . Fruits , all fruits and harvested ( non-growing ) vegetables , are in as desperate need of oxygen for their normal respiration as you and I. But they have no lungs , as we do , to inhale it . They must depend on its diffusing into their tissues . The syrup covering the fruit in the can completely cuts off all oxygen . If given enough time , the respiratory process of every fruit and harvested vegetable will utilize every trace of oxygen within their tissues . The cans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a steam-filled box called an exhaust box . As the can contents become warmer and finally hot , there is a two-fold effect in eliminating the oxygen . As the temperature rises , the gases in the fruit are expanded and some are actually driven out . But this , formerly regarded as the only effect , is only a minor effect , as anyone familiar with gas laws knows . More important is the increase of the respiration as the temperature rises ? just as you and I , when we run or play or work , get warmer and breathe faster to supply the increased demand for oxygen . The respiration in the fruit becomes more and more rapid until the high temperature finally kills the life process . This point is much higher for the fruits , however , than // for any animal . But when oxygen is withheld , the life process in fruits is not killed , as it is in animals . So avid is the demand of fruits for oxygen that when its supply is cut off , it takes oxygen from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remainder of the sugar molecule gives rise to products with less oxygen content . Among such products which have been identified are alcohol and acetone . I mentioned the puzzling experience the Tin Plate Committee had with canned apples . Apples are more porous than any other common fruit , and therefore contain more air , and hence oxygen , than other fruits . The air in them always contains less oxygen , in proportion to nitrogen , than atmospheric air because the apples are constantly using oxygen . It is their large amount of air ( minus a little of its oxygen ) that makes apples so well suited to the Halloween game of ducking for one in a tub of water . But in spite of the fact that air in apples contains somewhat less oxygen than normal air , it still contains so much oxygen as to render the exhaust commonly used for other fruits wholly inadequate to can them successfully . About the time that so much difficulty was experienced with apples , there was a patent issued to one of the large can companies to remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason given in this patent for the necessity of such a procedure is that apples , as well as other fruits , like growing vegetation in the fields , take up carbon dioxide and release the oxygen , thus causing a high oxygen content in the air of fruits . This is of course entirely in error , not only for apples but for all harvested produce , even the green leaves of spinach after it is cut . A pump will do an adequate job of removing oxygen from apples if it is a good pump , but a canner in Oregon accidentally found a better way . When apples were canned , the flesh of the apples tended to darken , becoming somewhat brown , as we all have seen in baked apples . This canner wanted to retain the whiteness . While experimenting to avoid the browning , his help peeled and quartered too many apples for his experiments , and they were told to cover them with a salt solution to keep them from darkening , as is done often with peeled fruits in many // households @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the canner did not regard the apples as suitable for further experiments , and he instructed the help to can them , even though he was doubtful about their passing quality standards . Upon examination the following morning after being canned , lo and behold , the apples were found to be white in color , just as the canner would have them . This , then , became the standard method for canning apples without anyone realizing that during the night , even at the cool Oregon fall temperature , the respiratory process consumed all the oxygen in the apples ' tissues , which was the real cause of the darkening of the apples as it is in baked apples . But holding a large quantity of peeled and quartered apples under a salt solution overnight required a large area and many tanks . Efficiency demanded experiments to hasten the process . As is well known , practically all processes in the plant kingdom are hastened by raising the temperature , and this was found to be effective with these apples . Now the time is reduced to about one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fahrenheit . The peeled and quartered apples are inserted into one quadrant of a large reel , the lower two quadrants of which are under a salt solution . By the time the first quadrant has been under the salt solution sufficiently long , the second and third quadrants have been filled . The reel is then turned to permit emptying the first quadrant and canning the apples , while the fourth quadrant is being filled . This provides a continuous process for preparing and canning apples . While apples were once the most corrosive fruit to be canned , they are now probably the least corrosive . In the chapter on vitamins , more will be said about this method of depleting fruits of their oxygen . But all this did not answer one of the confusing questions the Tin Plate Committee had raised : Why did enameled cans perforate more than plain cans with the same fruit , contrary to the fact that metals , particularly those involving iron , generally corrode much less when covered with an inert concoction such as paint or enamel used in cans ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good one for laboratory study in the nonOUTWITTING // canning season . I was aware that all corrosion is said to be galvanic . Briefly , galvanism involves two metals in electrical contact through an electrolyte , namely , the food in the can . The galvanic relationship of the iron baseplate and the tin coat seemed to me to be where the answer should be found as to why inside-enameled cans corrode more and perforate the cans more quickly . It should be borne in mind that no coating , whether it be another metal , paint , or enamel , is ever so perfect as not to leave at least pinpoint areas of the coated metal exposed . Even if such complete and perfect coverage in tinplate were possible , distortions to which tinplate is subjected in making cans , particularly sealing on the ends , would disrupt the continuity of the tin coating . One could therefore rely on the inevitability that the two metals of the tin can are exposed in every can of food , and are in contact with the can contents as an electrolyte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would supply all the essentials for galvanism . To understand all this , it is necessary to point out a very important and unique property of metals which is the basis of galvanism . This is the so-called solution pressure , or , in terms of more recent physical chemistry , the electrolytic solution tension , of metals . In simple terms , metals have a tendency to go into solution in an electrolyte , that is , any liquid consisting largely of water . But they go into solution in a different way from other products , for example , sugar . When a molecule of sugar goes into solution , it remains exactly as it was in the crystalline form . It in no way affects the solution electrolytically . Salt consists of a sodium ion with a positive electrical charge and a chlorine ion with a negative electrical charge . Although salt separates into its respective ions when it goes into a solution , the solution is not charged electrically because the positive charge on the sodium ion equals the negative charge on the chloride ion . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it leaves something behind on the metal , namely , one or more , ( depending on the metal ) negative electrical charges called electrons . In the case of tin , each atom , as it goes into solution , // leaves behind two electrons and therefore is no longer a complete tin atom ; it is then known as a tin " ion , " which has two positive charges of electricity called protons . In a tin atom , the electrons and protons exactly neutralize each other electrically . When an atom of tin gives up two electrons to the remaining tin and goes into solution as an ion with two positive electric charges due to its two excess protons , the solution becomes positively charged and the metallic tin becomes negatively charged . The same may be said of iron , each atom of which , when it goes into solution , leaves behind on the metal two electrons and becomes an iron ion with two positive charges of electricity , because of its excess protons . These positively charged ions from the metals cause the solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metals with their accumulated electrons of negative electricity . Some energy or force is involved in a metal 's going into solution in this manner . But this force can go only so far before equilibrium is reached and the negatively charged metal will attract the positively charged ions with a force equal to solution pressure of the metal . The amount of metal going into solution , from the standpoint of weight , is exceedingly small but is capable of easy measurement electrolytically . It apparently occurs instantly as the metal comes in contact with the electrolyte . The degree to which each metal positively charges the electrolyte with its ions is specific for each metal ; or , otherwise stated , the amount of negative electrical charge that each metal accumulates when in contact with an electrolyte is a specific property of the metal . The shape or size of the metal in no way influences or alters values . But it should be stated and borne in mind that the nature of the solution or electrolyte in which the metal finds itself is not without effect on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be amplified further on . When two metals are in contact with the same electrolyte , it is obvious that they will accumulate or acquire different negative electrical charges . At the time I contemplated these matters as applied to the inside of cans of food , all textbooks listed the // metals in a table termed the " electrochemical series of metals . " In this series , the metals were looked upon as arranging themselves in the order of their nobility , to use a rather unscientific term . Cathodic is more scientific than noble , or nobility . The most noble metals are platinum , gold , and silver ; then , with a big drop in nobility , follow copper , tin and iron , to mention only a few of the more common metals . The nobility is in inverse order of the negative electrical charge a metal will acquire in an electrolyte , which is specified in arranging the electrochemical series of metals . In terms of galvanism , the more noble metal in contact with a less noble metal in a given electrolyte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less noble metal to corrode more than it otherwise would by itself . On the other hand , the actual corrosion of the less noble metal would inhibit or minimize corrosion of the more noble of the two metals . Tin , listed as being more noble than iron , would tend to cause the iron to corrode more than if not in contact with tin . There was no question about this , as evidenced by the use of the table in textbooks accepted by scientists generally , and by those in the canning and tinplate industries in particular . To show how prevalent this idea was generally , and especially in the canning industry , I will quote from Rawdon 's book , Protective Metallic Coatings ( 1928 ) . This is an American Chemical Society monograph ; Rawdon was a well-known chemist in the U.S. Bureau of Standards . He says : So long as the coating is intact it tin affords excellent protection to the metal beneath from corrosion but it affords no protection in an electrochemical way after the underlying metal has been exposed , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron bear the same general electrochemical relation toward iron that tin does , that is , they serve as a cathode and the iron as anode when the two are in contact and wet with the same electrolyte . The effect of the alloyed tin upon the service behavior of the coated iron is therefore of no practical concern since pure tin itself affords no electrochemical protection to iron against corrosive attack . By " compounds of tin and iron , " Rawdon means the tin-iron alloy between the baseplate and the tin coat . In terms of rela50 CANORAMA OF A CHEMIST tive nobility of two metals in contact in a galvanic couple , the more noble metal is the cathode and the less noble is the anode . Rawdon thus says tin is more noble than iron , with no qualifications . I will also quote from Allen B. Dove , F.C.I. , M.E.I. , who delivered the Mordica Memorial Lecture in Chicago , in October , 1949 , when he should have been familiar with my work , which had been published in January , 1928 . Dove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Canada . The title of his lecture was " The Corrosion of Steel and Its Protective Metallic Coatings " ; among these , of course , tin is the most prominent . Dove related the discovery by Luigi Galvani in 1780 of the electric current produced by a bimetallic couple as evidenced by the twitching that it produced in a frog 's leg . He particularly calls attention to his ( Dove 's ) galvanic series , since , as he says , " it is based on actual corrosion testing experience with numerous corrosives in the laboratories , in operating conditions , and on practical results with metals and alloys in long service . " He asks that it " should not be confused with the familiar Electromotive Series which is found in many textbooks and is of value in physical chemistry and thermodynamic studies . " In " his " galvanic series , he still places tin on the same side of iron as copper . He thus regards tin as more noble than iron . Thus the galvanic relationship of iron and tin would appear to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enigma , that enameling the can on the inside intensified the tendency of the food to perforate the can ? that is , to corrode the iron where it is exposed ? did not cease to appeal to me . There is nothing more tempting than elucidating enigmas . This is not the exclusive right of such as Sherlock Holmes or Perry Mason . And remember that I proposed to my chief to study the electrolyte , the food that was doing the corroding , rather than the tinplate , involving the two metals . It required only relatively few experiments to convince me that the accepted views regarding the galvanic relationship between the iron and tin of a tin can , with anaerobic foods in // the can as the electrolyte , were greatly in error . But to convince a lot of doubting Thomases would require masses of data involving many electrical measurements and hundreds of corrosion experiments , many of which would require considerable time to mature . The corrosion experiments were made with specimens of baseplate ( the iron ) and of sheets of pure tin rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be 1 inch wide and 3 inches long , suitable sizes with which to work inside glass jars . One specimen of each metal could be placed in opposite sides of each jar . In some cases , there was no metallic contact between the two metals . In other cases , electrical contact between the specimens was made by cutting a very narrow sliver on one end of each of the two specimens long enough so that , after fusing the tin sliver on the iron sliver , the two specimens would again stand up on opposite sides inside the jar . The jar was filled with boiling fruit so that all oxygen would be eliminated , and the jar was then hermetically sealed . It should be understood that the specimens were weighed before they were fused together by the sliver ; after the experiment , by slight heating where the junction was made , the two specimens could be separated with no noticeable effect on the weight and they could then be weighed separately again . In this manner , hundreds of specimens were used with many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case when the two specimens had no electrical contact , the iron corroded more ( lost most weight ) than the tin specimen . When the two had electrical contact , the situation was reversed ; that is , the tin specimen lost most in weight , and much more than when not in contact , whereas the iron specimen lost much more when not in contact with tin . I must digress again to talk about another property more or less prominent in metals , so decidedly exhibited by tin that it caused me once to write an article entitled " Tin the Wonder Metal " I refer to what is scientifically called " hydrogen overvoltage . " Every electrolyte , even water , pure as it may be , contains hydrogen ions , which are atoms of hydrogen which have lost an electron and therefore have a positive electrical // charge just as do iron and tin ions , except that a hydrogen ion has but one positive charge , whereas tin and iron carry two positive charges each . An acidic electrolyte , like the fruits , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed in a simple acidic electrolyte , it corrodes very little . This is so because tin manifests hydrogen overvoltage to a high degree ; that is , it acquires a layer of hydrogen on its surface in some form or other , the exact form being theoretical . Hydrogen gas has two atoms per molecule . The hydrogen film on tin is probably not in gaseous atomic form . It is more likely to be in a monatomic form . It may even be in a chemical combination with the tin to form a tin hydride . There are known analogies for such combinations . The important thing is that , although tin is a less noble metal than iron and therefore might be expected to corrode more than iron when not in contact with another metal , it corrodes very much less . I want to mention one other effect of this hydrogen overvoltage on tin because it is very important in considering the food in the can as food , as will be done more fully in the chapter on vitamins , rather than considering the food as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hydrogen overvoltage provides . ( As a mere hint at this point , this is the opposite of oxidation potential . ) In all the experiments in which tin specimens were placed in fruits , in comparison with iron ( baseplate ) specimens , they always corroded much less than the iron . Although tin corrodes little when not in contact with iron , it corrodes more in colored fruits than in the non-colored fruits , such as grapefruit and pineapple . The colors in the colored fruits are known , as a class , as anthocyanin pigments . In their molecules they contain oxygen in a peculiar form , sometimes spoken of as tetravalent oxygen . Suffice it to say that the anthocyanin pigments have strong oxidation properties which tend to break down the hydrogen overvoltage on the tin and that , as a result , tin corrodes more in colored fruits than in non-colored fruits . The colors in turn are reduced chemically , but this is spoken of in the canning // industry as being bleached . This explains the necessity of enameling cans for colored fruits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Royal Anne cherries . All of them have a rosy cheek when ready to be picked . This colors the syrup when canned ? a fairly deep pink . This color is not wanted in Royal Anne cherries . Hence , they are canned in unenameled cans and , within a month or two , the color is bleached and the syrup is colorless . But this chemical reaction is more or less reversible . If the can is opened too soon after canning , the oxygen of the air again oxidizes the color , and again the syrup is pink . This sometimes results in complaints on the part of the consumer if the canner allows his pack to get on the market too soon after canning . Consumers generally do not understand this . It is of interest here to mention a closely analogous relationship to iron coated with tin , namely , iron coated with zinc , to which reference was made in the quotation from Rawdon . Whereas tin protects itself by the phenomenon of overvoltage with a layer of hydrogen , zinc , even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air with a coat of zinc oxide . Both zinc and tin in the absence of oxygen galvanically inhibit or minimize the corrosion of the iron with which they are in contact . Both are less noble than iron , yet they afford good protection for the iron as well as for themselves , the tin by hydrogen overvoltage , the zinc by its oxide . In one respect , the experiments involving the use of specimens of equal size of baseplate and tin did not represent the situation on tinplate , where huge areas of tin are exposed in comparison with microscopic areas of iron . To cover this situation in laboratory experiments , specimens of unequal areas were fused together with slivers as described above . When the area of tin was only twice the area of the iron , the corrosion of the iron was less than a fifth of what it was when the area of the two metals was the same . When the area of the tin was twentyfive times that of the iron , the corrosion of the iron was too small to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although there was a measurable increase of tin corrosion over the amount of corrosion of tin when it was not in contact with iron . It was said that each metal in an electrolyte develops a potential with reference to the electrolyte in which it finds itself , by virtue of the electrons that each atom of metal leaves behind when it enters the electrolyte as positively charged ions . This potential is wholly independent of the area of the metal , be it a sliver or an area a thousand times greater . Then how does tin exert its galvanic protective effect on the iron in proportion to its area ? So far , we have considered the electric current of the galvanic couple of tin and iron only from the standpoint of negative electrons flowing from the tin to the iron through the slivers that connect them . But that is only a part of the electric current . In Galvani 's case , the frog 's leg completed the circuit . In our case , the fruit completes the circuit . Now we must consider what takes place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connecting the two metals , the supply on the tin decreases as they flow through the sliver to the iron . This disturbs the equilibrium between the tin and the electrolyte . Consequently , more tin may enter the fruit as ions , leaving electrons to replace those that have passed through the sliver to the iron . This overabundance of electrons on the iron depresses the tendency of iron atoms to go into the fruit as positively charged ions , since the atoms would have to leave more electrons on the iron , already overcharged with electrons from the tin . As more and more tin ions accumulate in the electrolyte , if they should get near the iron specimen , a tin ion might theoretically be attracted by two electrons on the iron to neutralize its two neutrons and become a tin atom deposited on the iron . There is some evidence that this sometimes actually occurs in canned foods , but the evidence is questionable . Fundamentally , however , this involves the basis for the deposition of tin on baseplate in making electrolytic tinplate , which today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly in fruits which are moderately acid , there is an abundance of hydrogen ions , each with one // positive electric charge . The tin ion is about 125 times as heavy as a hydrogen ion and presumably at least as many times as large . Therefore , the hydrogen ion can travel many times as fast as the tin ion to reach the iron , where the two positive charges on the two hydrogen ions are neutralized by two electrons on the iron to form two hydrogen atoms . These combine to form a molecule of hydrogen ; many such combinations accumulate as a bubble of hydrogen gas . In canned fruits , this is the way so-called hydrogen swells develop . It was probably the hydrogen ions coursing through the frog legs of Galvani that caused them to twitch . In canned fruits , the hydrogen gas forms at the microscopic points of iron not covered by tin . I will now try to explain how the huge area of tin so completely depresses corrosion of iron on the minute areas exposed in a plain ( unenameled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involves two factors . First , there is the potential , the voltage , resulting from the solution pressure of the metal . An electric current may be likened to a stream of water . The potential is the steepness of the stream . Then there is the amount of water of the flowing stream . This corresponds to the amperage of the electric current . Suppose that , in an irrigation district , two streams are drawn from the same lake and for some time their slope is the same , but one is 5 feet wide and the other 50 feet wide . If anyone should hold his hand in them , he would find them to be flowing with equal force . But when the two streams reach their destination , the 50-foot stream will cover 10 times the irrigation area of the 5-foot stream . In other words , the 50-foot stream will protect from drought 10 times the area of the 5-foot stream , just as a large area of tin will give more protection against iron corrosion than a small area . Or , put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal areas , the 50-foot stream would produce a much better yield in the crops , just as the larger area of tin gives better protection for smaller areas of iron . This I have proven in experiments with tin and iron specimens supplemented by electric measurements . In an enameled can , the great bulk of the area of tin is covered by the enamel , but where a pinpoint of iron is not covered , there SG CANORAMA OF A CHEMIST is only the edge of the tin coating surrounding the pinpoints of iron exposed . Thus , the area of tin exposed in an enameled can may not even equal the area of iron exposed . The largest area of iron exposed is at the double seam . That is where the plate is distorted by crimping the end on the body . And so the enigma of why an enameled can results in more corrosion , has a greater tendency to perforate , than a plain can becomes clear . But first I had to prove to the satisfaction of all that tin in canned foods is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there will ever be a substitute for the tin can . If the question is whether we could find another metal with which to coat the iron baseplate , then it is easily answered " No . " Complete aluminum cans are now being made and used , mainly for frozen concentrated citrus juices and sardines . How widely aluminum cans will displace tinplate cans for such products is still problematical . A can made of steel baseplate and coated with platinum , gold , silver , or copper , even if it were cheaper than tinplate cans , would be worthless because those metals are so much more noble than the iron that such cans would have a great tendency to perforate . As often happens , fundamental discoveries are made simultaneously by different individuals . In patentable matters , the one who first makes a patent application is the winner . In nonpatentable matters , such as this corrosion question , the one who first publishes his results generally gets priority . I first presented the results of our experiments before the annual meeting of the American Chemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the January , 1928 , issue of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry . Lueck and Blair of the American Can Company arrived at the same conclusion : the tin in the tin can is anodic to iron , and in that state it tends to minimize the corrosion of the iron . Their work was first reported in September , 1928 , before the meeting of the American Electrochemical Society . However , the American Can Company workers and I were far from agreeing on our reasons for why this is true , and on the factors in back of this relationship . When a specimen of iron ( baseplate ) and one of tin are first introduced into an elecOUTWITTING // trolyte ? that is , in fruits ? the tin is actually cathodic to the iron . But in a relatively short time , minutes usually rather than hours , too short a time to measure the loss in weight due to corrosion , there is a reversal of the galvanic current between them and the tin becomes anodic to the iron and then remains so indefinitely . Lueck and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the true one , and the one that finally prevails to be due to hydrogen overvoltage on the tin . If it were the monatomic layer of hydrogen on the tin that is anodic to iron , it would have to have a solution pressure greater than the iron ; that is , the hydrogen atoms would go into the electrolyte as ions . It would then not be long before this monatomic layer of hydrogen would be used up in the process . To make the process continuous , the monatomic layer would have to be constantly reforming , and we would have all the requirements of a perpetual-motion mechanism . This would indeed make tin the wonder metal beyond wonder . There is no dispute about tin 's ability to develop a high hydrogen overvoltage . I have already indicated it as a very important property of tin in its service in a tin can , and I will have still more to say about its services to the food in the can . The electric current in a galvanic couple is a dynamic thing . It represents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the anode , is the electrons which are left on the tin , when an atom , because of the electrolytic solution tension , goes into the electrolyte as a tin ion . I ? it is a hydrogen atom as Lueck and Blair suggest , then that layer of monatomic hydrogen causing the overvoltage would soon be used up and we would be back where we started . If the film of hydrogen involved in the overvoltage increased the solution pressure of the tin , where is the source of energy which enables it to do this ? To my knowledge , there has never been any consideration of such a possibility . My explanation of the tin being for a short time cathodic is rather simple and based on well-known facts and conditions that are easy to understand . Tin , like many other metals exposed to the air , acquires a thin coat of oxide , an atom of tin combined with an atom of oxygen . If , as both Lueck and Blair and // I agree , tin is first cathodic , hydrogen ions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxygen of the tin oxide to form water , while the electrons coming from the iron electrode neutralize the positive charges or protons of the tin ions which were combined with the oxygen ; the resulting tin atom will be deposited on the metallic tin , thus affording a back pressure to the solution pressure of the tin and hence suppressing the tendency of tin ions to go into solution . When the thin layer of tin oxide is exhausted , then there remains only pure tin metal , which proceeds to put tin ions into the electrolyte , leaving electrons behind to supply the energy of the reversed galvanic current , and this remains its direction . It may be asked , Why is it that tin is actually anodic to iron when the electrochemical series given in practically all textbooks indicates otherwise ? In the first place , let 's be fair to at least some textbooks where it is pointed out that , while the electrochemical series is determined under what may be termed physical-chemical " standard " conditions in the electrolyte , those conditions do not pertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an electrolyte that will reverse the position of two metals from those they occupy in the standard electrochemical series . Scientists in the tinplate and the canning industries had fixed the standard table of the electrochemical series in their minds but did not fully familiarize themselves with the text accompanying it . If memory serves me correctly , some textbooks illustrated a reversal of nobility in the galvanic couple of copper and zinc . Each of these two metals will send atoms minus two electrons ( ions ) into the electrolyte until equilibrium is reached . Copper , being more noble than zinc , will reach equilibrium with fewer atoms than zinc . If the two metals are now made to touch each other to form a galvanic couple , the greater number of electrons on the zinc will travel to the copper , which will be cathodic . But now suppose something is put into the electrolyte that precipitates the copper ions as soon as they form , thus virtually removing them from the electrolyte . This will cause more copper ions to enter the electrolyte and // the electrons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current and the relative nobility of the two metals . In canned foods , tin ions tend to be removed from the electrolyte by some of the food components , and this adds to the wonder of tin as a part of the tin can . The process by which tin ions are removed from solution in fruits is known as adsorp-tion , and the ingredients that adsorb tin ions are the proteins . Fruits are not especially high in protein , but there are adequate amounts for the occasion . In the berries , there is an abundance of protein in the seeds , and it is in the seeds of the berries that most of the tin which berries acquire from the can is found . It is of interest to consider the significance of this adsorption of tin by protein from the standpoint of the can contents as food . Since the passage of the first pure-food law in 1906 , the government has been obligated to consider the wholesomeness of all foods . As canning procedures developed , it became incum-bent upon the government to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the province of the U.S. Bureau of Chemistry . It was well known that canned foods acquired both iron and tin from the can . The matter of iron caused no concern since it is well known that we need iron in our diet . Leading nutritionists who have worked on iron availability in our foods have assured me in correspondence that there is no reason for assuming that the iron which a food acquires from the can differs in availability from that normally in the food . This bad long been my belief . On May 24 , 1962 , to satisfy my own ideas , I wrote to Dr. C. A. Elvehjem , an authority on iron availability , then president of Wisconsin University . He replied : " I assume you mean iron which may have gone into solution in the con-tents of the can .... I am sure this iron would be available to the animal body . " On July 27 , 1962 , Dr. Elvehjem died . Being in some doubt as to whether it would be ethical for me to quote from Dr. Elvebjem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous students , Dr. Frederick J. Stare , head of nutrition and biological chemistry at the Harvard University School of Medicine , who replied : " I am certain that it would // be entirely ethical and , in fact , highly desirable for you to include a direct quotation from Dr. Elvehjem in your forthcoming book . " But the U.S. Bureau of Chemistry did concern itself about the tin that foods acquire from the can ; I quote from their report to the National Canners Association : It was planned to undertake primarily feeding experiments with both animals and human beings , in which experiments the tin ingested should be only that normally acquired by the food in contact with tin as in canned foods . ( a ) In one group guinea pigs were the experimental animals and were fed canned pumpkin which contained 777 parts per million of tin . In this group of animals some were fed the tin diet for approximately five months , while others were killed periodically during the course of the feeding experiments . ( b ) On all of these animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note whether there was any retention or storage of tin . All these tests were negative of tin . No attempts were made to collect either urinary or fecal samples from these experimental animals . A series of cats were fed canned sardines containing 212 parts per million of tin . Some of these cats were fed a period of seven months , while others were killed at intervals before the expiration of the full feeding period . Here analyses were made of the various internal organs and no evidence of the retention of tin obtained . In the cat experiment also , no urinary or fecal analyses were made . ( c ) In order to determine the urinary and fecal elimination of tin a human diet squad of four subjects was made . In this experiment the four subjects were placed on a diet shown analytically to be tin free for a period of 9 days . This was followed by a tin-feeding period of 6 days in which canned pumpkin and canned asparagus were fed . The canned pumpkin was in two separate lots , one of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 363 . The canned asparagus contained 361 parts per million of tin . During the tin-feeding period , the four subjects ingested a total of 2,278 to 2,942 milligrams of tin with an average daily ingestion ranging in the four subjects from 426 milligrams to 290 milligrams of tin . During this tin-feeding period the diet was supplemented by such of the tin-free foods as the subjects desired . Following the tin period was a return to the tin-free diet for 10 days , which period was divided into three intervals , that is , ending the third , sixth and tenth days . The urine and feces eliminated by each of the subjects were composited for each of the periods indicated and analyses made for tin . In the // urinary samples , no tin was found in either the pre-tin , tin or post-tin periods . In the tin period fecal analyses showed the greatest elimi nation of tin , with diminishing amounts in the three samples of the post-tin period with measurable quantities of tin still present ten days after the tin-feeding period . The elimination of tin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 73.8 , 91.4 and 91.2 percentages respectively , for the four subjects . It may be stated that neither during the tin-feeding period , nor during the post-fin period did any of the subjects show any evidence of illness or discomfort even after ingesting such abnormally large amounts of tin-containing foods . From the above , it seems clear that the tin taken up from the can by the food is firmly bound by some constituent of the food , which I take to be protein , and that this combination is indigestible and the adsorbed tin passes through the digestive tract without any effect . ' Protein , by absorbing tin ions , serves to make tin metal anodic to iron , and thus minimizes corrosion and at the same time renders the tin taken up by the food inert so that it never enters the bloodstream . A rather wonderful property for a good container ! In a water solution of acetic acid equivalent to the malic acid in apples , tin is cathodic to iron . However , in my experiments I have shown that , if various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crushed peanuts , crushed almonds , crushed prune kernels , crushed cherry pits , and so on , the tin becomes anodic to iron . This undoubtedly is due to the tin ions being kept at a low level on the tin surface because of their being absorbed by the protein . Another striking thing , not so easily explainable , is that increasing the acidity of low-acid products , notably low-acid fruits such as sweet cherries and prunes , increases the anodic relationship of tin to iron and that in these canned products it had a striking effect in lessening the losses from corrosion . When I first reported that increasing acidity lessens corrosion , I received no little razzing from some die-hards because in most cases of corrosion this is not true . One of the worst-perforating // fruits , which must be canned in enameled cans to preserve the beautiful color , is the wonderful Bing cherry of Oregon and Washington . Adding citric acid very markedly diminishes their tendency to perforate the can . In one experiment , in 302 days , without citric acid addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were perforated ; a quarter of one per cent of added citric acid reduced the perforations to 14 per cent ; a halfper-cent addition of citric acid reduced the perforations to 6 per cent ; while with a one-per-cent addition of citric acid , there were no perforations in the cans . Unfortunately , the increased acidity changed the flavor to such an extent as to make it impractical , although in some fruits the same acidity is not undesirable . In another case , the addition of acid was desirable from a taste standpoint . Prune puree , made from dried prunes , when canned in plain cans as baby food , swelled the can so soon after canning as to make its canning almost impossible . Parenthetically , now that all baby foods come in glass jars , many do not recall that at first all baby foods were packed in cans . I would not appeal to a mother to look at the label of a can of prune puree for her baby for a notice saying that " acid " had been added , even though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from sulfuric or muriatic acid . But there was an easy way out in the case of prunes , which often have lemon added when stewed at home . As long as prune puree was packed in cans , it had added lemon juice to supply citric acid , which renders tin more anodic to iron and greatly reduces the hydrogen formation in the can ; otherwise , the can would swell early in its history and would be unsalable . Frankly , I can not offer a satisfactory explanation for this phenomenon , but it has been thoroughly proven in actual canning , in corrosion experiments , and in electrical measurements . Since it solves a problem rather than makes one , there is lacking the usual motive to investigate the reason . Here it is appropriate for me to add further to my encomium of tin , the wonder metal . Practically all foods taste better in plain cans than in enameled cans or in glass . Tomatoes and tomato // juice may be cited . I think practically every packer of tomato juice has tried glass for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass . It is utterly impossible to pack grapefruit or grapefruit juice in glass or in enameled cans . It turns dark and becomes distasteful . One canner did can some grapefruit sections and grapefruit juice in tumblers which could be used as drinking glasses . They had a wide mouth . He inner-lined the covers with tinfoil and stored the containers upside down for a month before shipping them out for retail sale . At one time , Stokely , a prominent canning firm , extensively advertised the " golden lined can " in which they canned many products . This was merely the usual enameled can . But its merchandising appeal had a marked impression on Mr. Dorrance , president of the Campbell Soup Company , and he gave me the assignment to try all their products in enameled cans . I did not limit myself to enameled cans . I had stainless steel cans made . In some enameled cans , I placed strips of plain tinplate , which I carefully tinned at the cut edges to avoid an overexposure of iron . At the Campbell Soup Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the president . While I tasted many cans of soup , plain , stainless steel ( practically non-corrodible ) , enameled , and enameled with a strip of tinplate , the final decision that all products tasted better in plain cans than in enameled or stainless-steel cans was not mine . All soup eaters know that canned soups come in plain tinplate bodies with enameled ends . One striking thing came out of these experiments , for which I have no explanation , but which has often caused me to wonder . Canned macaroni in cheese sauce in enameled cans acquired the typical evaporated milk flavor far more strongly than any evaporated milk I ever encountered , while in plain cans no such flavor developed . Why do canned foods taste better in plain tin cans ? I can give only my explanation ; no one has ever proved why . I saw a statement by a Continental Can Company technologist in one of their publications that it is the tin ions which improve the flavor . With this I do not agree . As far as I have been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea to a controlled test . It is // merely the easiest answer that might occur to one . Foods in tin cans acquire tin ions ; they taste better in cans than in glass : ipso facto , tin ions make canned foods taste better than foods in glass containers . My explanation is quite different . We have already called attention to some deleterious effects of oxygen . In my estima tion , oxygen is inimical to practically all foods . In all my think ing and observing , I have come across only one instance in which oxygen reacts favorably . I have in my youth helped to make many a batch of cider . When first pressed , it is insipid . The next day , it is what cider should be . In canning apple juice , care must be taken to avoid overexposure to air or it becomes cider . In preparing foods for canning , there is unavoid ably some exposure to the air . This is particularly true in the case of such products as tomato juice and soups , but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another effect of the hydrogen overvoltage on tin . This affords a high reduc tion potential which goes a long way to overcome the delete rious effects of oxidation that might have taken place during preparation of the foods for canning . The tin in a tin can has a twofold reduction capability ; in turn , it can be oxidized in two steps . When tin enters the food in a can , it enters as a stannous ion carrying two positive charges of electricity , the atom having lost negative charges of elec tricity ? that is , two electrons . These two electrons are capable of reducing an atom of oxygen , which then can not oxidize anything else . If no oxygen is present , the two electrons are capable of reducing some food component that oxygen had previously oxidized during exposure to air . The stannous ion is capable of giving up two more electrons which can reduce an atom of oxygen or some food component that oxygen had previously oxidized . Based on this principle is a patent used in the pineapple industry for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms of frozen pineapple . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has sanc tioned this use of tin salts for purposes of stablizing such pineOUTWITTING // apple products . Each stannous ion in those salts is capable of giving up two electrons which may reduce an atom of oxygen and thus prevent that oxygen from oxidizing anything in the pineapple . In this patent , there is no claim that the tin improves the flavor ; it merely stabilizes the flavor by preventing oxidation . This confirms what I have long held to be the true role of the plain tin can . The reader may have received the impression that from the standpoint of corrosion , inside enameling is always undesirable . This is not the case . The best can is the one in which the area of iron exposed is the smallest possible in proportion to the tin exposed . Distortions of the tinplate in making the can are the cause of the greatest iron exposure . Of course , distortion of the tinplate is greatest on the can ends , at what is called the expansion rings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more so in the double seam . By enameling the can ends , the ratio of the areas of exposed iron and tin is greatly reduced . Hence , can ends are generally enameled . Figures 1 and 2 show how completely the plain unenameled body prevents the enameled end from corroding . What can not be seen in Figures 1 and 2 is that , had the can ends not been enameled , the greater area of iron exposed would have caused tin corrosion on the uncoated body . There is also serious distortion of that portion of the body of the can Mich enters into the double seam . In experimental work , I have shown that if the can body is strip-enameled , an even better can results . By " strip-enameled , " I mean that each end of the body has a strip of enamel about 1/2 to 34 inch wide . This strip is applied before the can is made , while the sheet of tinplate is still flat . Such a can lengthened the shelf life of the can for all of Campbell Soup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The shelf life needed for a product depends on the time required to sell it ? that is , its turnover period . In general , soups should not require as long a turnover period as a seasonal product . Strip enameling makes necessary an additional operation in the making of the can . If the longer turnover // is not necessary , the added cost of strip enameling can not justify itself . One of the most interesting problems in tinplate corrosion with which I had to deal came with the advent of the glass jar for baby foods . It happened that about the time the glass jar for baby foods came into use , the president of Campbell Soup Company gave me the assignment of developing the five baby soups which each producer of baby foods was providing : liver , chicken , beef , lamb , and vegetable soup . He made this assignment conditional on the proviso that unless I could come up with better products than were on the market , the Campbell Soup Company would not be interested . This did not worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Association , I had worked with some of the baby-food packers and one of the big packers remarked that flavor in baby foods is of relatively little importance because babies will eat dirt and chew rugs . With such an attitude on the part of top management , there was little one could do toward improvement of quality . At the Campbell Soup Company , I knew , the baby soups I would develop would first be examined not by babies or their mothers but by Campbell Soup Company 's top officials , including the president . It did not take me long to satisfy those officials on the basis not only of taste compared with products on the market but of vitamin content . Their appreciation was gratifying . And as glass jars were beginning to be used , they decided to put the soups in glass jars . Incidentally , a pleasing flavor in such products and preservation of vitamins go hand in hand . Aromas and vitamins are both sensitive . Soon rumors appeared that other packers were experiencing perforations in the caps of the glass jars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but was at first not much concerned because I knew that such products as I had developed would not perforate cans in many years ; and the same tinplate was used to make the caps of the glass jars as was used in making the cans . But the rumors persisted and became word-of-mouth reports . I finally checked in the warehouse and found that a quarter of the jars of liver soup packed only a few months had // perforated caps . Furthermore , this was not a case of tinplate being distorted as in crimping the ends on cans . Perforations occurred on perfectly flat surfaces . It was one of the most disastrous cases of corrosion ever encountered in the canning industry , and to me the most inviting . No one asked me to work on the problem . I simply sat down and went to work . This was a challenge right at my front door . I made experiment upon experiment for a matter of about three months . I was not interrupted by other assignments being given me . I knew that other packers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat them were having work done at the Mellon Institute in Pittsburgh , the Batelle Memorial Institute in Columbus and the Armour Institute in Chicago . At the end of about three months , I had the mystery solved . With that information , the glass and cap manufacturers have been able to minimize and practically eliminate the difficulty . Again it proved to be a striking case of galvanism in which there was a huge cathode and tiny anode , a reversal of the condition in a plain can with its huge anode and tiny cathode . I suppose the ability to put facts together from different sources is what in time gives one the title of expert . One startling factor in this case was that not even a trace of hydrogen was ever found in glass jars . Since hydrogen appears at the cathode , the cathode could not be inside the glass jar . Since perforations appeared on flat surfaces of the enameled caps , the area of metal exposed was very small , and since the perforations occurred in such a short time , the cathode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed the way . Years earlier , the can manufacturers used paper gaskets to hermetically seal the can end on the body but only at the bottom of the can where the paper could be kept dry during the sealing operation . It did not make a satisfactory seal if the paper got wet before the seal was completed . With some products , notably canned tomatoes , there appeared in time what was called " white rust " outside the can in the crevice between the end and body of the can on the end with the paper gasket . An analysis of this material disclosed that it consisted of sodium , // potassium , and tin carbonates . The carbon dioxide of the air would explain the carbonate and there was , of course , a goodly supply of tin from the can , outside or inside . But from where could the sodium and potassium come ? Only from inside the can : the sodium came from the salt used to season the tomatoes , and potassium is a common constituent of tomatoes . But the can was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or out . True , the seal was a paper gasket which might act as a blotter and , as the tomato liquid dried on the outside , more and more liquid soaked through , so to speak , to keep it moist . Unless the paper gasket was constantly wet , the seal would not be hermetic . So far , the logic is faultless . But not all the conditions have been accounted for . The sodium in the can was there associated with chloride ions and the potassium with some anion of the tomato , most likely the citric ion . There was no chloride or citric ion in the white rust . Sodium and potassium are positively charged ions which travel to the cathode . The chloride and citric ions are negatively charged and they travel to the anode . Therefore , the anode had to be inside the can and the cathode on the outside of the can . The paper gasket at all times would be expected to be wet with tomato juice , which acted as the electrolyte of the galvanic couple . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make either metal cathodic to the other by bubbling air around it . Hence , the outside tin can surface would be expected to act cathodic to the inside surface . Thus , the explanation of the perforations in baby food caps was relatively easy for me to discover . But there was a difference between the white rust of the canned tomatoes and the baby foods . There was never any sodium or potassium outside the seal of the baby food jars . It should be borne in mind that there were more hydrogen ions than sodium or potassium ions in the baby foods and since the former travel much faster , they could serve to take up electrons from the cathode and , in turn , in the presence of air either combine with oxygen and form water or form bubbles of hydrogen and escape in the air . The baby-food caps are cut from enameled sheets of tinplate as flat // discs . While there is some distortion of metal in forming the caps , it is not as pronounced as in crimping the ends on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are pinpoint areas of iron exposed even on flat surfaces of enameled tinplate caps . These provided the tiny anodes , while the outside edge of the cap provided the cathodic areas , huge in comparison . The gaskets used in the caps to seal them on the jars were of the nature of artificial rubber , but the pressure between cap and jar was limited by the fragility of the glass . This was adequate to prevent sodium or potassim ions from passing through , but it is well known that hydrogen ions have no difficulty in traveling through such materials . No doubt if one held the jars in a container free of oxygen , sooner or later one would be able to find hydrogen gas in it . But although many a criminal has been executed on circumstantial evidence , here the evidence was indisputable . The cap manufacturers diligently worked on gasket materials , and today the difficulty is minimized to a great extent . Some will claim that no such galvanic couple between inside and outside metal still exists in baby food jars , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrosion that causes surface discoloration , darkening , in some jars with some products . It has been shown that hydrogen ions will go through the baseplate ( iron ) of the tin can . Therefore , I think it would be a difficult matter to find a gasket material that would definitely and completely prevent hydrogen ions from passing through in significant amounts . Even though such a material could be found or produced , the pressure between the gasket and the glass , being less than atmospheric pressure , is in my estimation not enough to prevent formation of a film of moisture , that is , electrolyte , between the gasket and the glass . Capillarity has a greater force than the relatively few pounds per square inch between gasket and jar . Some may not agree with me in this viewpoint . I have stood alone before , at least temporarily , and I am content to do so now in this matter . As soon as someone reports finding hydrogen in a jar of baby food , I will be convinced there is an inside cathode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard // this evidence as grotesque , but to the discerning scientist , it is irrefutable and definitely convincing . In the seam of the tin can , the pressure , even with the paper " gasket , is many thousands of pounds per square inch . In the meantime , the Campbell Soup Company was beginning to find that mothers were not much inclined to buy their soups when they then had to go to other packers ' shelves to buy the individual products , such as carrots , peas , and so on . And now with perforated caps in a rather large pack that had been made in readiness for national distribution , it was decided to drop the baby-food business . But my services with reference to babies did not end there . Government bulletins generally carried an admonition not to feed soup to babies because it was too filling , providing insufficient energy and protein . The Campbell Soup Company had been rather meticulous in their advertising about this adjuration . I suggested that if their general soups were diluted with milk instead of water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consulting relationship with a leading pediatrician , and I urged them not to take my word alone but to ask his opinion . To this they agreed . All the Campbell Soups were lined up around a table , one can of each variety diluted with milk and a second with water . The pediatrician waxed enthusiastic about the dilution with milk : this would even provide a way to get children who refuse milk alone to get their quota . The Campbell Soup Company thereupon put on an advertising program to promote diluting their soups for babies with milk . The vice president in charge of research asked that one of the soups not be included in the display for the pediatrician because he thought it too highly spiced . By mistake , the chef included it and , after the pediatrician had failed to notice it as different from the others , I told him about its having been included by mistake against the wish of the vice president and asked him to examine it again . He said there was no need for excluding it . About this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during my postretirement period and could take time off when I wished , my wife and I flew to the Hawaiian Islands , there // being a strike on the ship line . In touring the Islands , I noticed Campbell Soups in all the gift shops and roadside stands , as well as in stores . On returning , I was told by Campbell 's sales department that on the Islands there were being sold annually 11 cans per person with no sales office there , while on the mainland the sales were only 81/2 cans per person . But not long after the promotional program advocating Campbell soups diluted with milk for babies , sales in the United States rose to 11 cans per person . The reader will have to be the judge as to cause and effect . Before leaving the subject of corrosion , I wish to tell of an interesting examination of a certain lot of Royal Anne cherries , some cans of which were hydrogen-swollen . On opening the cans , I noticed some of the cherries had blisters under the skin . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lighted match over a blister while puncturing it with a needle , I was able to obtain a small explosion . Thus , hydrogen swells of Royal Anne cherries provided some fun , possibly more than some human swells . But the fun did not end my further curiosity . I wanted to know where in the can the cherries first acquired the blisters . For this I picked a can that was not yet a swell but had lost much of its vacuum . I had my hunch , and it proved correct . I carefully picked out the cherries , noticing exactly their position in the can . I found that the cherries with blisters lay adjacent to the corner of the can , if a round can may be said to have a corner . More accurately , they lay near the crevice that is made where the end is crimped on the body of the can . After having examined thousands of cans , removing the ends by opening the seams , I became convinced that the distortion of the tinplate in this area was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to be formed ? on the cathodic iron exposed by distortion of the tinplate in crimping the end of the body of the can . Now an explanation is in order as to why the hydrogen formed blisters . As hydrogen formed in the can , it dissolved more or less in the cherries . As the hydrogen pressure increased , more and more of it dissolved . When the can was opened , the hydrogen pressure // dropped to zero . The cherries were then supersaturated with hydrogen , and the excess escaped from solution and formed bubbles which the skin of the cherries captured . A Note on the Discovery of Galvanism* I have long been under the impression that Galvani 's wife , rather than Galvani , should be given credit for the discovery we know as galvanism . Galvani was a biologist and was studying the effect of an imposed electric current on the nerves of skinned frog legs . The electricity caused the muscles to undergo con-tractions and the leg to twitch . Legend has it that his wife , nee Lucia Galeazzi , daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a woman of superior intelligence . One day , as she was preparing frog legs for her husband 's experi ments , she noticed that when her scalped touched the metal of the machine on the table and was simultaneously in contact with the nerve of the frog leg , the leg twitched just as when an electric current was imposed . Over the years , I developed a real admiration for Galvani 's wife on account of her observation . But this admiration received a severe shock from a lecture entitled " The Guide of Life , " by C. J. Ducasse , Professor of Philosophy at Brown University , as published in the January , 1958 , issue of Phi Beta Kappa 's Key Reporter . According to Ducasse 's version , Galvani 's wife was a consumptive , and her physician prescribed broth made from frog legs to strengthen her . One day , as Galvani was preparing frog legs for his wife 's broth on his balcony , which had an iron railing , he hung the prepared legs on the railing with copper hooks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused . This version has more or less been ridi culed in the literature as being on old wives ' tale , on the grounds that if Galvani were cooking this for his wife , he would // more likely be doing it in his kitchen , rather than in his laboratory or on his balcony . To me it seems far-fetched on the part of a physician to have the idea that the tremendous strength of frog legs would be an inherent property of the broth made from them . After all , Galvani was a biologist and as such it is doubtful that he would harbor such a notion . I wrote to Professor Ducasse , who thereupon made a search of all available encyclopedias and other publications in which galvanism was mentioned , and found each version about equally often but all lacking evidence as to which was true . I recently located translations in English of Galvani 's publication , Commentary on the Effect of Electricity on Muscular Motion and of Galvani-Volta ? A Controversy That Led to the Discovery of Useful Electricity , and went through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bimetallic effect on the nerves of many dead animals . He had earlier also studied what has been termed a " marine torpedo , " an " electrical animal , " possibly our electric eel . He found the same effect as with two metals . Galvani was thus imbued with the idea of animal electricity . He believed that the electricity involved in two metals as he used them originated in the animal tissues , and called it " animal electricity . " When Galvani 's work first came to the attention of Alessandro Volta , the latter was inclined to accept Galvani 's idea that the electricity involved was animal electricity . His interpretation was that there was an upset in the amount of electricity in the muscle and the nerve and that the two metals served to complete the circuit and restore the balance . But as he experimented himself , he soon changed his mind . He observed that when he placed a piece of tinfoil on his tongue in contact with a silver coin , a sourness developed . When he made his eye a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensation of light , just as a blow on the eye does . Then began the heated argument that is said to have led to the discovery of useful electricity . But this controversy was not between Galvani and Volta , as is usually stated , but between Volta and Galvani 's nephew , Giovanni Aidini , Professor of Physics at the University of Bologna . Galvani is reported to // have tried to answer Volta in only one publication . He seems never to have realized that the electricity involving two metals results from a change in one or both to produce electric energy . While Galvani reports that an assistant first noted the bimetallic effect on frog nerves , there seems to be no record as to the identity of the assistant . The evidence strongly points to its having been his wife . At any rate , my admiration for her has been restored . I have written to the head of the chemistry department of the University of Bologna and also to the president of the university , asking if there is any way to learn if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed the twitching of frog legs in their experiments was his wife or someone else . I have never received an answer . I suppose the answer to it is anyone 's preference . // The Elusive Vitamin Before I finished my graduate work , Dr. E. V. McCollum had published his discovery of vitamin A. But during my college career , this had not yet gotten into any textbook ; I do not recall its having been incorporated into any of my professor 's lectures , although one of my minor subjects was physiological chemistry and my major was organic chemistry , in either of which it would have been appropriate . But the idea of vitamins had been publicized in popular literature , as it well deserved to be . To me , it appeared to promise one of the most far-reaching developments in any branch of science . My greatest regret during the next several years was that , in the positions I held , it was not appropriate for me to do any work in the field myself . However , in time such an opportunity presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind that is prepared . " When I first joined the Research Laboratories of the National Canners Association , the problem to which I was assigned was far from suggesting anything pertaining to vitamins . But developments regarding vitamins were so intriguing that I felt anyone and everyone dealing with the handling of foods should know , would be interested in knowing , about the fundamentals involved . I therefore indulged in what might be called extracurricular activities in writing two articles on vitamins . Both my chief and the secretary-treasurer approved my request to submit them to the canning trade papers for publication . But when I wrote a third paper , those same superiors had second thoughts on the matter . As they put it , " Better let sleeping dogs lie . If there are vitamins in the foods that are canned , we will can them . If not , we can not can them . " But even dogs do not // sleep all their time , and in this case they were , before long , provoked to noisy barking . About that time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time no doubt the outstanding food chemist of the whole world , author of several textbooks on food chemistry , and Victor K. LaMer , one of Sherman 's graduate students , whom I had known as an undergraduate at the University of Kansas , published a paper entitled " The Physical Chemistry of Vitamin C. " They heated tomato juice in Erlenmeyer flasks placed in water baths held at various temperatures ? 60 , 80 , and 100 degrees centigrade . There was a cotton plug in the mouth of the flask . Since my second minor in graduate school was physical chemistry , the subject was not unfamiliar ; the purpose of the cotton plug was a mystery to me since , as far as the atmosphere was concerned , the flasks were still wide open . Such cotton plugs are normally used to prevent bacterial entrance but , at the temperatures involved , bacterial activity was impossible . I shall leave this point in abeyance for the moment . Sherman and LaMer reported there was an increasing loss of vitamin C with increase in temperature and drew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that heat destroys vitamin C. Dr. McCollum was then at the University of Wisconsin and much in the limelight because of his discovery of vitamin A , the first of the alphabetic series . He no doubt received many invitations to speak at other universities and before other groups . Since Wisconsin was a prominent canning state , he was fully familiar with the fact that , while Sherman and LaMer used a maximum of only 100 degrees centigrade ( 212 degrees Fahrenheit ) , all canned products other than fruits are sterilized at 240 to 250 degrees Fahrenheit . McCollum was of course fully aware of the fact that only a beginning had been made in the discovery of vitamins . The publication of Sherman and LaMer to the effect that vitamin C is destroyed by heat gave him cause for concern as to what might be the effect of the heat of canning on other vitamins , still undiscovered . General nutrition was his field . He had done // notable work in the field of farm-animal nutrition but felt the discouragement of the slow progress with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years to answer many questions . Fully cognizant of the common elements in the problems of nutrition of different species of animals , McCollum decided he could make much greater progress with small animals . He therefore proposed to make his studies with rats but ran into serious opposition from his colleagues in the university . What would Wisconsin farmers say to rats being raised in their agricultural college , a species of animals whose extermination was their main concern about them ? This opposition on the part of his fellow college workers and officials for a time seemed to be an insurmountable obstacle . Fortunately one backer , whose fame reached to all parts of the world , came to his support . This was Stephan Moulton Babcock , who invented the method , known by his name , for determining the fat content of milk . This became the basis on which milk was evaluated for purchasing throughout the world , and was of great help in preventing the adulteration of milk by the addition of water . McCollum thus became the first to use the white rat for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our nutritional knowledge today is based on information gathered from experiments with the rat . McCollum had no grounds for doubting the report of Sherman and LaMer . In his speeches and lectures he could only report what was in scientific literature . I had earlier asked permission to do some work on vitamins , but then my ideas as to exactly what to do were not definitely crystallized . As a consequence , my request was easily disposed of by the " powers that be " with reference to sleeping dogs . However , I had by now finished an exhaustive study of the occurrence of oxygen in foods in connection with studies of corrosion inside the can . ( This is described in the previous chapter . ) I now calculated the vapor pressure of tomato juice at the temperatures used by Sherman and LaMer . Suffice it to say that it is lower over tomato juice than over water at the same temperature . Even at 100 degrees centigrade it displaces less of the atmosphere // than many people might think , evidently including Professor Sherman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water vapor and air ( a cotton plug can in no way change that ) , and the sum of their two pressures must equal the atmospheric pressures . Since the tomato juice in the Erlenmeyer flasks used by Sherman and LaMer was in rather shallow layers or depths , the convection currents in the free-flowing juice would be quite effective in bringing changing portions of the juice to the surface and exposing it to the oxygen of the air over the juice . There were some indications in scientific literature that vitamin C might be susceptible to being destroyed by oxidation . Since this would be a chemical reaction , it would be , like all chemical reactions , more rapid at higher temperatures , as also would be the convection currents . These factors could easily be expected to offset the lesser amount of air over the tomato juice at the higher temperatures , and explain the greater destruction with the higher temperatures . I now stuck my neck out , so to speak , and wrote a paper by putting together all such thoughts as the above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be " granted permission for me to give this before a national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Pittsburgh . The import of this paper was that if Sherman and LaMer had excluded air exposure , as is done in canning , they would not have had any vitamin C loss . Since I gave this paper before a meeting of the American Chemical Society , it was the society 's privilege to publish it . But before I sent it to their journal for publication , I sent it to Professor Sherman , since I discussed his work in it . He penciled on the margin of the manuscript : " Such destructive criticism should not be published . Not only the vapor of the tomato juice but the cotton plug in the mouth of the flask excluded air . " That a cotton plug will exclude air is of course without a smidgen of reality , and although I had done not even a lick of work on vitamin C , I gave my paper the title " The Protection of Vitamin C in Foods . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That accomplishment must be credited to Dr. E. V. McCollum , whom I had never met. // One day Mr. W. R. Roach of Grand Rapids , Michigan , a former president of the National Canners Association and , at that time , the dean of the canning industry and the packer of as high quality of canned foods as have ever been canned , came to me and said , " What are we going to do with this man McCollum ? He is going to kill our business . " He then elaborated on the publicity that McCollum 's statements were getting , particularly on the possible effect of the heat of canning on the vitamins , obviously based on the report of Sherman and LaMer on their work with vitamin C. I did not suggest we do anything to or with Dr. McCollum . I told Mr. Roach the time had come for the National Canners Association to do something on the question of vitamins in canned foods . By now what I wanted to do was well crystallized in my mind . I wanted to prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protection of Vitamin C in Foods . " At that time , there were no chemical methods for determining the presence of any of the vitamins . They could be determined only by feeding experiments with appropriate animals . The basic procedure was to concoct a diet lacking a certain vitamin on which animals would either die or , before that dire end , show the avitaminosis symptoms of the particular vitamin in question . By then adding gradient portions of the food to be tested , its comparative vitamin content could be estimated . It was then known that rats did not need vitamin C in their diet . They never suffer from scurvy ; they can make their own vitamin C. Now , the metabolic process by which they do this has been pretty well worked out . It is now known that only man , primates ( monkeys ) , guinea pigs , and a few less-known and unimportant species require vitamin C in their diet . All other species make their own from the food they eat . It is therefore not the whole truth to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now made with Dr. Walter H. Eddy , professor in Teachers College , Columbia University , who had done notable nutritional work in animal feeding , to do the work of feeding the canned foods , which I would arrange to be // packed under strictly commercial conditions under my supervision . The agreement stipulated that the results of all experiments , whatever they might be , were to be published by him as senior author and myself as junior author . Such an agreement , I think , implies at least two interpretations : ( 1 ) The canning industry , more particularly my superiors , realized that facts in this field could not long be hidden . ( 2 ) I had gained the confidence of my superiors . Dr. Eddy neither received nor asked for an honorarium . He had to have help in feeding the animals ; this was provided in the budget . The Teachers College 's laboratories provided facilities for which there was no provision in the budget . I think both Columbia University and Dr. Eddy were pleased to have this work done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so popular was anything pertaining to vitamins at that time . Dr. Eddy was then also director of Good Housekeeping Bureau , which was several times as remunerative as his professorial salary . Dr. Eddy was one of the most interesting and pleasant men with whom I ever had to deal . Professionally , as a scientist , he was outstanding , though often criticized on the ground that he tended to sell his science for a mess of pottage ( meaning publicity ) . Everyone who worked with or for him held him in the highest and most affectionate regard . No one ever considered him unfair in any respect . The following typifies this . While the agreement was that he was to be senior author of all publications , after the first paper he said to me , in substance , that all original ideas involved in our work were mine and therefore it was more appropriate that I be the senior author . I do not recall that either he or I ever brought the matter up with the National Canners Association , but after our first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further on , I was senior author of all publications . About this time , a Miss Delf in England published her work on the effect of home-cooking cabbage on the loss of vitamin C. At that time , the so-called fireless cooker was much in vogue . Miss Delf cooked cabbage in a fireless cooker , and also by direct boiling . In all cases there was serious loss of vitamin C ? // 70 to 90 per cent . While cabbage , to my knowledge , was never canned commercially , I decided to can cabbage because of Miss Delf 's experiments . The experiments were designed to bring out the effect of both the time and the temperature of heating for sterilization , commonly referred to as processing . At 240 degrees Fahrenheit , a rather common temperature used with vegetables , the time we used was 15 minutes in one lot , 30 minutes in another , and 45 minutes in a third . Another lot was processed 30 minutes at 260 degrees , a temperature not then used for any product , to my knowledge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 60 minutes . Since there was no precedent as to how cabbage was to be prepared for canning , I had to develop my own idea as to how it should be done . One might expect air to be trapped between the leaves in the head . The head was first cut lengthwise into sectors . After cutting off the core from each sector , the can was filled as solidly as possible with these sectors with the same net weight in each can , for simplicity in weighing out amounts for feeding . The cans were then filled to the brim with the usual hot brine , that is , water with enough salt for seasoning . This brine displaced most of the air between the leaves and in other voids in the can . The heat of the brine was not enough to inactivate the respiratory enzymes , but it speeded up their activity in consuming the oxygen , both within the cabbage tissue and possibly adhering in films on the surface of the leaves . The cans were then passed through a steam exhaust box . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to heat the contents further , so that when the closed can and its contents were eventually cooled it would acquire the desired vacuum to draw the ends into a concave position . Even after emerging from the exhaust box , the temperature did not become high enough to completely inactivate the respiratory enzymes , which would continue to use up oxygen well into the first portion of the process time . There was some loss of vitamin C in every lot of canned cabbage but no great loss , such as reported by Miss Delf in home-cooked cabbage . The loss in the canned cabbage was // established by comparing it in feeding experiments with some of the raw cabbage . The loss was less than in cabbage cooked in open kettles in the kitchens of the Home Economics Department of Teachers College . But the striking result disclosed in feeding the various lots of canned cabbage is that there was no difference because of degree of temperature . The lots processed for 30 minutes at 240 and 260 degrees Fahrenheit showed no difference in vitamin C content . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later compared with the stored raw cabbage in January and February , it had actually more vitamin C than the raw cabbage from which the outer wilted leaves were discarded . These results completely disproved Sherman and LaMer 's report to the effect that heat as used in the canning industry destroys vitamin C. I had , in connection with corrosion studies in canned fruits , made a thorough study of the occurrence of oxygen in apples , the fruit that contains more oxygen than any other fruit . I demonstrated how the respiratory process could be employed to eliminate every trace of oxygen in the apple tissues . For our second experiment , therefore , I had canned , according to my directions , a series of lots of apples at Geneva , New York . From the corrosion studies , I got the idea that the respiratory process in apples might , more effectively than a vacuum pump , remove oxidative substances that might destroy vitamin C. I reasoned that although the respiratory process in apples used the oxygen in burning sugar and evolved carbon dioxide , such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Several lots of apples were canned , but of particular significance were the following three , for all of which the apples were first peeled and quartered . 1 . The apples were held under a 2 per cent salt solution for a time ample to allow the respiratory enzymes to consume all the oxygen in them ( actually , overnight ) . The salt merely served to prevent darkening . The apples were then packed in cans which were then filled with water . 2 . The apples were placed in cans , and the cans were then set under a bell jar and subjected to a high vacuum , which was // released with nitrogen . This was done three times , but for the final repetition , the vacuum was released with air-free water , to completely cover the apples in the cans . 3 . Immediately after being peeled and quartered , the apples were inserted into the cans without any further treatment . The cans were then filled with water . After all the other cans were prepared , they were passed through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desired vacuum in the can after they were closed , processed , and finally cooled . For sterilization , it is necessary to process apples for only a relatively short time ( 15 minutes ) at 212 degrees Fahrenheit . The cans of the first two lots were practically free of oxygen , whereas the cans of the third lot had 4.5 cubic centimeters of oxygen per can . The fact that apples contain so much oxygen or air made them particularly suitable for this experiment , as it likewise does for bobbing for apples at Halloween time . These three lots of canned apples were designed to bring out the destructive agents responsible for vitamin C loss . Other lots were also canned , but they tended only to emphasize what these three had disclosed . Now we will see what that answer was . In lot 1 , there was no detectable loss of vitamin C when fed , in comparison with raw apples from the same lot . The apples were canned in October . In March , a normal storage period for the variety used , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C , but the vitamin C content of lot 1 of the canned apples was still the same as when canned ; that is , they now had a higher vitamin C content than the raw apples from the same lot . It would not be justified to say the canned apples of this lot had lost no vitamin C. Now that we have more accurate chemical methods for vitamin determinations , there is indication that there may be some vitamin loss with long storage of canned foods . On the other hand , the chemical methods have also proved that all raw produce loses vitamin C , some rather rapidly , while in the canned foods the vitamins are relatively stable . The canned apples in lot 2 did show noticeable loss of // vitamin C. This bears out the idea that while the vacuum pump would remove gaseous oxygen , there might be intermediate respiratory products , before the carbon dioxide stage is reached , in which the oxygen still has a destructive effect on vitamin C. I do not wish to maintain that the respiratory process produces intermediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More work is necessary to establish such a point unquestionably . The third lot of canned apples , which received no treatment to eliminate oxygen , had no vitamin C at all . Guinea pigs receiving them in any quantity developed scurvy as soon as those receiving the basic vitamin-C-free diet . In other words , 4.5 cubic centimeters of oxygen in a 600-cubic-centimeter can is sufficient to destroy all the vitamin C in the apple . An actual calculation revealed , moreover , that this figure , 4.5 cubic centimeters , is not far from being the correct amount to oxidize the vitamin C in the apples . These three lots of canned apples conclusively proved that vitamin C is readily destroyed by oxygen in foods when they are heated . As a matter of fact , the destruction also takes place at ordinary temperatures , although at a slower rate . It has not been established whether the loss of vitamin C in sound raw products ? the loss on storage of apples and cabbage , already noted ? is due to oxidation or some other effect . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C ( ascorbic acid ) in the young tomato plant might reflect the vitamin C content of the tomatoes that the plant would eventually produce , I soon found that the plants , after being in the sunlight all day , had about twice as much ascorbic acid as they had the next morning . I found that , if the plants were cut off at their base in the evening and placed in water to prevent wilting , they retained their ascorbic acid to a far greater extent than if left growing in the soil until morning and then cut off . Evidently the growing plant in its normal condition used the ascorbic acid in some way , possibly to produce higher carbohydrates . Experiments with peas , years later , revealed quite a different situation . By bubbling air through the puree pressed from green // peas , I could destroy all the ascorbic acid as measured by the chemical method for its determination . However , in a relatively short time ( an hour ) most of it returned . This was brought about by an enzyme which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is oxidized , the resulting product is dehydro-ascorbic acid . If this is taken by mouth , it has the same vitamin C value as the original ascorbic acid . But it is very unstable , and outside the digestive system it soon breaks down to products that are irretrievable as vitamin C. The juice of potatoes and apples , and no doubt many other products , has no such recuperative mechanism for oxidized ascorbic acid as exists in peas . There are now chemical methods to reduce dehydro-ascorbic acid back to ascorbic acid in many juices , but unless this reduction is carried out promptly , the dehydroascorbic acid breaks down to recoverable products , other than vitamin C , which have no vitamin C value . The value of the findings with canned cabbage and apples to the canning industry was inestimable . Instead of lowering the prestige of canned foods , the vitamin story , with its wide dissemination , enhanced that prestige . Dr. E. V. McCollum recorded the results of our experiments in the next revision of his The Newer Knowledge of Nutrition , the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead of " killing the canner 's business , " he became one of the industry 's most valuable supporters . A few years later , he and I wrote separate sections of a bulletin which the National Canners Association published and distributed . The value of the findings were of equal importance to me personally . They completely justified all statements I had made in my paper " The Protection of Vitamin C in Foods . " All those statements might be said to be based on circumstantial evidence , since I had previously done no work pertaining to vitamins . It might justifiably be said , " I stuck my neck out . " I prefer to think of those far-reaching statements as having been made on the basis of sound reasoning . The important thing about them is that the results of our experiments proved they were fully justified . Perhaps I was just lucky . Many sayings , even proverbs , // may be found about luck and chance . John Ray is quoted as saying : " It is better to be lucky than wise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck . Strong men believe in cause and effect . " It was of importance to me that there was now no question about these vitamin studies being continued . Various other vitamins were subsequently studied in a number of products over a period of more than ten years , resulting in fifteen scientific papers and a considerable number of semipopular papers . The work elicited a considerable amount of editorial comment in various well-known publications . At that time , the Literary Digest was among the more widely read popular publications , and it ran reviews of our work . It is interesting to recall that the Literary Digest fell by the wayside because it so firmly predicted that Alfred Landon would win the presidency over Franklin Roosevelt . More important were the reviews in the Journal of the American Medical Association and in that Association 's popular journal , then called Hygeia , which is now Today 's Health . To sum it all up , our studies demonstrated that there is no more efficient way than commercial canning to bring to the consumer 's table the intrinsic nutritional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the consumer grows himself for prompt use . He can not do as efficient a job of canning them himself as commercial canning , which makes them all available at all times in every place . I have often been asked about frozen foods . The first frozen vegetables were marketed by General Foods . This is natural , since they were marketing fish frozen by the Birdseye process . But General Foods did not produce the frozen vegetables themselves . They had a member of the National Canners Association freeze them . This too was to be expected , since the canners grew the raw products that were appropriate for freezing . From this relationship , it seemed evident that the freezing of vegetables would eventually fall to the lot of the canners . It was therefore entirely appropriate that I study the freezing of vegetables . Rumors had it that General Foods were anxious to bring // the vegetables to the housewife as if they had just been freshly harvested . Some one facetiously added they were going to leave some soil on them to make it more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the fact that at the time winter tomatoes sold as high as seventy-five cents a pound while in summer they could be produced for one cent per pound . I therefore picked the tomato as the first vegetable to get my attention for freezing . From the first , it looked disappointing . Upon thawing , the tomatoes collapsed seriously and lost all semblance of firmness . Perhaps I was too slow in getting them frozen , I reasoned with myself . I hit upon a remedy for that difficulty . I would freeze them in liquid nitrogen . This proved to be very revealing . After a tomato frozen in liquid nitrogen had thawed , it was almost possible to grasp the core at the stem end and lift the entire fiber out of an almost clear amber-colored juice which was all that was left of the tomato . I therefore dismissed the idea of liquid nitrogen and proceeded with vegetables with less water . I froze the gamut of our common garden vegetables . But within a few months when they were thawed and cooked , they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once that only enzymes could bring about such changes . By dropping the frozen vegetables directly into boiling water I proved that this change had taken place during storage in the frozen state . In short , enzymes can not be inactivated by freezing . It was therefore clear that they had to be inactivated before freezing , and the only practical way was to apply enough heat to inactivate them . The blanching process used in canning vegetables seemed the appropriate way to achieve the desired end . This left the vegetables more or less uncooked and not ready for serving as are canned vegetables . Such blanched vegetables when frozen and properly stored in the frozen state underwent practically no change either in structure or flavor . I wrote this up as a scientific paper to be presented before the meeting of the American Chemical Society in Buffalo , in 1928 . For some reason I could not attend that meeting and the paper was not read , but its abstract , which // one had to submit accompanying it , was published . Thus my work on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date . In the spring of 1931 I went to Oregon to study the canning of fruits on the West Coast . I landed at the cannery of the Ray-Mayling Company in Hilsboro , Oregon . As I called upon manager Bert Mayling and started to tell him what I had in mind with the canning of fruits , he said , " I 'm not interested in fruits this morning . I have sixty thousand dollars ' worth of unsalable frozen beans . I wish you would tell me what is wrong with them . I 'll have some sent out to our kitchen and have our home economist cook some for you . " We walked out to the kitchen ; the beans had already arrived and were being opened . I sniffed the air and said : " You need not cook them . I know what is wrong with them . You did not blanch them . All vege-tables must be blanched for freezing . " Bert Mayling said he had sent some of the beans to their ( General Foods ' ) laboratory and their chemist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were frozen . " If their chemist does not know more about beans than that I do not want anything to do with the  --  - . " In appearance , the beans were perfect . At the moment , they were freezing peas without blanching . According to Bert Mayling , they had been freezing vegetables for three years but had to destroy many of them shortly after distribution . At that time , then and there , they started blanching the peas . Whether my friend , Bert Mayling , made the change on his own or first consulted General Foods officials , I do not know . But that marks the beginning of the successful freezing of vegetables . I am given credit in textbooks and elsewhere for having first demonstrated that , for freezing , vegetables must have their enzymes inactivated . This had not been necessary for fish or fruits , the latter having been frozen for years in bulk , with some added sugar for subsequent use in making jams and the like . At a meeting of the National Association of Frozen Food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one paper : " Speaking particularly of vegetables , it is not surprising that the basic // principles are not generally known , for it was only twenty years ago that Kohman of the National Canners Association first reported the deleterious effect of enzymatic activities in frozen vegetables . He observed that if the enzymes were inactivated by a short precooking period , vegetables could be frozen , and if properly stored , their flavor remained unimpaired over a normal distribution period . Kohman 's work on frozen vegetables is at some time to be as significant to this industry as was Appert 's to the canning industry . " Several years later , when the distribution of frozen fruits in retail packages got under way , in the development of which the U.S. Department of Agriculture took an active part , I was vividly reminded of my experience with freezing tomatoes in liquid nitrogen . The U.S. Department of Agriculture had an exhibit of their study of the effect of the temperature at which the frozen fruits were frozen and of the temperature at which they were subsequently stored . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at which the fruits were frozen ( if one may use the term " higher " in connection with freezing temperatures ) , and the higher the temperatures of subsequent storage , provided the fruits were kept frozen , the less was their collapse when thawed . This was especially noticeable with strawberries and peach and pear halves . Enzymes in fruits seem to produce no markedly adverse flavor effect in frozen fruits . Hence , low temperatures in freezing and storage are to be decried in the case of frozen fruits , instead of extolled . But the temperature must be low enough to prevent mold and other microorganisms from growing . The relative efficiency of canning as opposed to freezing in supplying the intrinsic nutrients is the next problem . Subsequent to our work on the vitamins in canned foods , when chemical methods became available , both the canning industry and the freezing industry made extensive vitamin analyses of their products . But these methods do not tell the whole story of what the consumer gets , because frozen foods are saturated with air and still need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free of air ( hence , of oxygen ) . // Both canned and frozen vegetables get a short precook ? the blanching process . The canned foods are then hermetically sealed to exclude air ( oxygen ) as far as possible ; they are then processed , which includes thorough cooking . Frozen foods , after being blanched , are cooled in water ; this might be expected to continue some extraction of soluble nutrients , from which foods for both canning and freezing suffer in blanching . But in pack-aging for freezing , the vegetables are drained , and each parti-cle ? pea , lima bean , cut bean , carrot slice , or cube ? is packaged surrounded by air . To prepare canned vegetables for serving , no actual cooking is required . They have been fully cooked and need only be warmed to serve , and are thus devoid of even a trace of oxygen : such a product takes up air ( oxygen ) very slowly , too slowly to have any effect while heating for serving . Frozen vegetables throughout their preparation are surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . Not all vitamins are affected by oxygen under such conditions as is vitamin C. It is therefore not possible , at present , to make an accurate estimate of the relative efficiency of canning and freezing in bringing the nutrients of vegetables to our table . In answering questions on this subject , I usually state that there is probably not much difference and that , since each consumer must decide for himself the matters of flavor and cost , he had better let these decide for him . If I am pressed , I usually present the matter as I have above . I have implied that canning tends to stabilize nutrients . This statement needs some qualification . Nothing organic is stable . If it were , life would not have gotten started on this globe . Canned foods consist of a mixture of numerous organic com-pounds , including a number of mineral elements . It has been reported from Yale that three hundred compounds have been identified in the one-celled tuberculosis bacillus . It can be sur-mised that a can of food contains just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disorganized state , in a medium more or less favorable for interaction , without such interaction , is expecting too much . It is well recognized that canned foods do deteriorate in quality , but the changes are so slow as not to // interfere seriously with normal distribution . It is also recognized that they deteriorate more rapidly in the tropics , where the temperature is higher than average . Canned foods cached by explorers in polar regions have been found with little change in quality after many years . A striking phenomenon in this connection may be cited with orange juice . When the frozen concentrate was first put on the market , the idea was not to subject it to any heating since the freezing temperature would prevent bacterial activity . But it was found that the enzymes , even in the frozen state , were still active enough to spoil the juice , interfering with the distribution of this seasonal product . Now the temperature that is found necessary to inactivate the enzymes is sufficient to pasteurize the regular-strength canned juice . One advance that seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is that cold storage in some form or other will be increasingly employed . There are new methods under experimentation for sterilization that do not require the drastic heat treatments now necessary , which are responsible for the color and flavor that are often so different from home-cooked foods . But unless cold storage is employed , the gains in color and flavor revert more or less to that of the regularly processed foods before it is possible to distribute seasonal products . A combination of such methods with satisfactory cold storage may be looked for with improved quality . As intimated , the freezing of concentrated orange juice may be cited . A word here is in order about the catchy phrase " quick " or " deep freezing . " There is a lot of hocus-pocus being foisted upon the public in the use of such phrases . For blanched vegetables it has no meaning at all . Whether they are frozen in twenty-four seconds or twenty-four hours is immaterial . The essential requirement is that , after blanching , they be cooled sufficiently , and promptly enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freezing is not necessary , unless " freezing " is too long delayed . The texture of the foods is independent of the time required to actually freeze them . I once attended an exhibit of various frozen fruits at the // U.S. Department of Agriculture laboratories . It was definitely brought out by the samples that the less severe the freezing and the higher the subsequent storage ( of course while maintaining the frozen state ) , the better was the quality after thawing . The main effect of the low temperatures was a greater collapse of the fruit pieces , such as whole strawberries or peach and pear halves . For over ten years , I have practiced in my own home what I call " frigicanning . " In this I have used the run of garden vegetables that I have myself grown . After the necessary prepa ration required ? shelling the peas , cutting the green beans , peel ing the small onions , slicing the carrots ? I add enough water , properly salted , just to cover the vegetable in the kettle in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them about 5 minutes , then insert them , with their proportionate amount of the boiling liquid , into glass jars which I had previously arranged to have ready in another kettle of boiling water . I immediately close the jar with the disc and screw top , the disc having also been in the boiling water . I then replace the closed jar in the boiling water from which it was taken . My kettles permit handling only six pint jars at a time . When all the filled jars are back in the boiling water , I take the kettle to the kitchen sink and start cold water running into the boiling water in the kettle , stirring the water and avoiding the stream of cold water hitting any jar , as that would break the jar . Within two minutes the danger of breaking jars is passed ; and in fifteen to thirty minutes , depending on whether they have free-flowing liquid in them , the contents are practically as cool as the spigot . They are then placed in a regular refrigerator which I keep as near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole year , such products are practically the same as when picked in season and prepared for eating at once . I mentioned that I became senior author for all publications of our vitamin studies after the first paper , with one exception , which I will mention here . During the course of our studies , Dr. Martha M. Kramer of the laboratories of the department of foods and nutrition of the Kansas State Agricultural College // reported her studies of Kieffer pears , raw and home-canned , open-kettle and cold-pack . She reported that the open-kettle canned pears had lost all their vitamin C , but the cold-pack pears retained some . I reasoned that , in cold-packing the jars , the pears would be covered with syrup for a greater or lesser time before the jars were closed . Since this was done in glass , which is a poor conductor of heat , the pears would not for some time reach a temperature that would inactivate the enzymes . But the warming-up time would speed up the respiratory activity , and much of the oxygen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the respiratory process . This would explain the better retention of the vitamin C in the cold-pack as against the open-kettle canned pears ; in the latter , the temperature of the pears might be expected to become heated in a much shorter time . It occurred to me that , if Dr. Kramer was willing , this would be a good opportunity for us to carry on a joint experiment comparing home canning and commercial canning . Dr. Kramer gladly joined us in the cooperative experiment . Pears are fruits that can not be allowed to reach the raw eating stage on the tree . There is not and can not be such a thing as a tree-ripened pear . It would not be of acceptable quality for distribution . There are two chief varieties of pears that are canned , Kieffer and Bartlett . Kieffer pears are picked when hard and green and , for canning , are placed in cold storage . This is mainly a Michigan operation . Periodically , some are brought out of cold storage and allowed to ripen and mellow , to be suitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time after harvesting , and commonly not in cold storage . The Kieffer pear-canning season may be long , extending into January and February . Actually , the amount of vitamin C in pears and any favorable data on its preservation in canning are of little significance . But to obtain the interest of an independent , unbiased investigator such as Dr. Kramer at this time was of untold value to the canning industry . The unfavorable publicity based on misconstrued evidence , solicited by those who did not understand the circumstances , had put the canning industry in a bad light . // It always takes much more effort to correct a mistaken idea than to introduce one . The canning patriarch 's fears that McCollum would kill his business did not involve McCollum alone . In the earlier history of canned foods , there had been a serious lack of confidence in canners . Much of this lack of confidence had been overcome , but now it was threatening to reappear from nutritional considerations . As our vitamin work progressed , it gave promise of being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popularity of vitamins . Dr. Kramer deserves more than a word of thanks and appreciation from the canning industry for her efforts in this connection . Dr. Kramer reported that open-kettle home-canned pears lost all their vitamin C , whereas cold-packed pears retained some . It has been explained how the cold-pack method prob ably embodies some of the principles of commercial canning , the principles involved in eliminating oxygen and helping to preserve vitamin C. Upon testing the commercially canned Kieffer pears , if canned before being stored to the point of becoming mellow and ripe for eating , there was no loss of vitamin C. But the commercially canned , mellow Kieffer pears had somewhat less vitamin C. Only ripe , ready-to-eat Bartlett pears were canned commercially and they , upon being tested by Dr. Kramer , were found to be on a par with ripe Kieffer pears . It may be recalled that we had previously found that apples stored normally to reach the eating stage had lost some vitamin C ; and no doubt the same happens with pears . There is a lack of knowledge on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in vitamin C of different fruits . The large tree fruits such as apples , pears , peaches , and apricots rank very low compared with the citrus fruits and tomatoes ( which are also citrus fruits in the sense that their main acid is citric acid ) . The small fruits , strawberries , raspberries , gooseberries , currants , and such , markedly outrank even the citrus fruits , which most people believe to be our richest source of vitamin C. Black currants are outstanding . Whereas a high figure for oranges is 50 milligrams of ascorbic acid per 100 grams of fruit , black currants have been reported as having as much as three // hundred milligrams per 100 grams of fruit . Milligrams per hundred grams are exceedingly small percentages , as a little figuring will disclose . One per cent of 100 grams is 1 gram or 1,000 milligrams . Fifty milligrams is one-twentieth of 1,000 , which , written as a decimal fraction , is 0.05 per cent , the amount of ascorbic acid in oranges richest in vitamin C. This will help us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products that have been discovered . In 1948 , the Western Regional Research Laboratory of the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported they had found green English walnuts ( a misnomer : the walnuts are of Persian origin ) to contain 25 to 30 per cent of ascorbic acid , or 25,000 to 30,000 milligrams per 100 grams . According to the report , even the ripe hulls contained 5 per cent of ascorbic acid , and methods to extract it had reached the pilot-plant stage . Evidently , things never went further than the pilot-plant stage , and it is easy to understand why . Commercial synthesis and production has been developed to produce it at a lower cost than it can be extracted from any natural product and the manufactured product has its identity with the natural product proven beyond any question . While oranges are reported in the U.S. Department of Agriculture Handbook to contain 49 milligrams of ascorbic acid per 100 grams , apples contain only 5 milligrams , peaches 8 , apricots 7 , and pears only 4 . Yet a prominent professor of nutrition at Cornell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few decades ago seldom saw an orange except in their Christmas stocking , went on record as saying that no one eating an apple per day would ever suffer from scurvy . We are told that each of us needs each day 5,000 International Units ( I.U. ) of vitamin A. Half a cup of cooked carrots will provide 12,500 I.U. and half a cup of baked sweet potatoes will provide 9,510 I.U. I could go on and on in this fashion with all the known vitamins and reach the conclusion , to sum it up , that there is nothing more absurd than to say that any normal person in these grand United States needs vitamin pills , with our abundance of nutritious foods . Scurvy was the first recognized dietary deficiency disease . // To me the most graphic description of scurvy is to be found , not in medical books , but in Richard Henry Dana 's Two Years Before the Mast . Scurvy was first known as the " black death of the sea " ; it has been estimated that , from the fifteenth through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is therefore appropriate that I quote from Two Years Before the Mast . The setting is aboard ship east of South America on the return trip from San Francisco to Boston . The scurvy had begun to show itself on board . One man had it so badly as to be disabled and off duty , and the English lad , Ben , was in a dreadful state , and was daily growing worse . His legs swelled and pained him so that he could not walk ; his flesh lost its elasticity , so that if pressed in it would not return to its shape , and his gums swelled until he could not open his mouth . His breath too became very offensive ; he lost all strength and spirit ; could eat nothing ; grew worse every day ; and , in fact , unless something was done for him , would be a dead man in a week , at the rate he was sinking . Then after meeting the Solon , just from New York , fresh foods , chiefly onions and potatoes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dozens . The chief use , however , of the fresh provisions , was for the men with scurvy . One of them was able to eat , and he brought himself to by gnawing upon raw potatoes and onions ; but the other , by this time , was hardly able to open his mouth , and the cook took the potatoes raw , pounded them in a mortar , and gave him the juice to drink . He swallowed by the teaspoonful at a time ; . . . by the effect of this drink . . . he became so well as to be able to move about . . . . This course soon restored his appetite and strength , and in ten days , ? from lying helpless and almost hopeless , ? he was at the mast head , furling a royal . The foregoing treatment of potatoes in a mortar and pressing out the juice is reminiscent of a report in a French journal , published about the time I wrote my " Protection of Vitamin C in Foods . " Berssonoff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in potatoes resides in the juice or the pulp . He pressed the juice out with a hydraulic press and found it less active than the intact potato when fed to guinea pigs . The pressed pulp , in // amounts equal to the intact potato , had very little vitamin C. And the juice returned to the pulp reinforced it only slightly . The experiment was very revealing to me in my decision to . write and publish " The Protection of Vitamin C in Foods . " It seemed plain to me that in manipulating the potato in this way there was ample opportunity and time for the oxidation of vitamin C and for breakdown of the resulting dehydro-ascorbic acid . Now this is known for certain . Potatoes do not have the dehydro-ascorbic acid reductase that I later found in peas . On May 20 , 1747 , Dr. James Lind , a Scottish naval surgeon in the Royal Navy on board the Salisbury at sea , divided twelve patients , equally afflicted with scurvy , into six pairs . " They all had putrid gums , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he wrote . Each pair was given a different dietary addition . The two who received two oranges and a lemon per day for six days were fit for duty by the time that the supply was exhausted . When they came into Plymouth on the 16th of June they were appointed nurse to the rest of the sick . On May 22-23 , 1953 , the Lind Bicentenary Conference was held at his alma mater , Edinburgh University , and a memorial plaque was placed in its halls . One might expect that scurvy in the civilized world would never again appear . But when bottle-feeding of infants became the custom in the United States , scurvy became prevalent in infants . As a result of active educational work by Dr. A. F. Hess of New York , an eminent pediatrician , it became customary to add fruit juice to the diet of bottle-fed infants . At that time , Dr. Hess went on record to the effect that infants can tolerate tomato juice , which of course is always in the canned form and is therefore not raw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was practically always obtained by squeezing an orange , and hence was unheated . And thus I am afforded an opportunity to get in a plug for canned tomato juice , of which I will have more to say a little further on . In spite of something in fruits and vegetables that was recognized as the antiscorbutic factor for years , even centuries , before the term vitamin was coined , it was only about thirty // years ago that this important substance was isolated and iden-tified as ascorbic acid . There is some confusion and difference of opinion as to who deserves the credit for this important development . Dr. Charles Glen King , professor in the University of Pittsburgh , and his graduate students and co-workers were actively engaged in isolating and identifying the antiscorbutic principle in citrus fruits . Among them was Joseph L. Svirbely , son of a Hungarian emigrant steel worker in the Pittsburgh area . Joseph Svirbely received his undergraduate training in the University of Pittsburgh and completed his thesis for his Ph.D . under Dr. King , working on this problem . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem of tissue respiration , with no thought of any vitamin being involved , since at that time it was not recognized that many of the vitamins , if not all , functioned as enzymes or co-enzymes in such body functions . In his work he reported having isolated a reducing substance from cabbage , in crystalline form , which he designated hexuronic acid . Under such conditions , " crystalline form " is tantamount to being a single , chemically pure compound . Joseph Svirbely , upon completing his Ph.D . thesis under Dr. King , received an exchange student fellowship and asked Dr. King to arrange a European connection for postdoctorate work . This arrangement Dr. King made with Wieland in Munich , Germany . But shortly before he was to leave , Joseph Svirbely , largely at the urging of his father , decided instead to go to Hungary to work with Szent-Gyorgyi . While working with Dr. King . Svirbely had attempted to repeat Szent-Gyorgi 's prepara-tion of crystalline material , as had some other laboratories , but all failed . This is not surprising since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable in manipulation than in others . In substantiation of this , I need only recall the difference in potato and pea juice . Nevertheless , Svirbely knew that the antiscorbutic preparation he had made in Dr. King 's laboratory had resem-blances to Szent-Gyorgi 's preparation . In the meantime , King and his co-workers further purified their material and identified it as ascorbic acid . // When Joseph Svirbely reported all this to Szent-Gyorgyi , it is easy to imagine that the latter must have gotten much excited upon hearing of the work in the University of Pittsburgh . At any rate , he immediately asked Svirbely to test his hexuronic acid , isolated from adrenal glands or cabbage ( which was known as a good antiscorbutic vegetable ) , for vitamin C activity , although Svirbely had gone there to study anatomy , pathology , and physiology . But the powdered milk necessary for the basic diet was not available , and the animal experiment failed ; no positive results on the activity of vitamin C of Szent-Gyorgyi 's product were obtained until after Dr. King had sent an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chemists ( the usual custom before presenting a paper at a coming meeting ) . At the same time he sent a short paper to Science ( also customary when one has made an important discovery ) . Then too , there was the Ph.D . thesis of Dr. Svirbely in the University of Pittsburgh archives . There seems , therefore , to be no doubt that Dr. Charles Glen King and his co-workers deserve the credit for first having isolated and identified vitamin C as being ascorbic acid . Szent-Gyorgyi received the Nobel Prize , officially in recognition of his studies on tissue respiration , which included his work on hexuronic acid , which later turned out to be ascorbic acid . Many have gotten the impression that the Nobel Prize to Szent-Gyorgyi was in recognition of his being the first to have isolated and identified vitamin C as ascorbic acid . This could have been avoided if he and Svirbely had been more circumspect in giving credit where credit was due . Svirbely continued his work with Szent-Gyorgyi for two years , but they gave no reference to Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any of their publications . Since then , both Dr. King and Szent-Gyorgyi have done scientific work that has brought them eminence . One is sometimes led to wonder about the value of such awards . Are they necessary ? Do they accomplish anything ? Are they really an incentive to scientific endeavor ? It is obvious that in this case the incentive predated the award . Does not science itself offer
