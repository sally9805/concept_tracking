In war and in peace , women have stood staunchly beside Viet Nam 's menfolk for nearly 2,000 years . Sometimes , they have stood in front . Still celebrated are the two Trung sisters who mounted elephants to lead a revolt against Chinese overlords in 40 A.D. More recently , Madame Nhu carried the banner in Saigon toward the end of the Diem regime and thought it only proper that her sloe-eyed daughter , Le Thuy , receive a pistol for her 18th birthday . <P> The better to shoot Viet Cong with , declared Madame Nhu , who knew only too well the uses that the V.C. were making of their own female stalwarts . One such is Kim Loan , a pistol-packing mama commanding a guerrilla company near Saigon , who occasionally slips into the town of Tan An for a hairdo . Other tools are the thousands of fishwives and fruitsellers in the market places of South Viet Nam 's cities . Their vending stalls provide handy platforms for picking up information or passing propaganda and military messages . <P> <P> Powder Puff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mangues ( sweet as mangoes ) . One sweetie surfaced from Viet Cong ranks last April when South Vietnamese police caught a " pretty , well-shaped and lovable " 17-year-old girl named Nguyen Thi Nga , which means " Moon Fairy . " She and two friends had been making themselves lovable around the U.S. officers ' mess at Soctrang Airbase , which they planned to blow up with plastic bombs fitted into talcum powder cans . The Viet Cong run a sweeping intelligence network by means of Saigon 's myriad bar girls , also have agents working in most of the U.S. military installations around the country . One knowledgeable observer estimates that at least half of the female help employed at Danang also work for the Viet Cong . Though the V.C. often encourage wives to go along with their guerrilla husbands , few women are actually combatants . An exception was among the Viet Cong dead after last month 's bloody battle at Dong Xoai . There lay the body of a girl lieutenant company commander . <P> The Communist press of late has been proudly recounting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a guerrilla since 1940 , now has risen to the rank of deputy commander as well as member of the National Liberation Front presidium . Nguyen Thi Dinh got her Communist apprenticeship in the V.C. 's Women 's Liberation Association , which functions in thousands of South Vietnamese villages . The W.L.A. is a kind of Viet Cong ladies ' aid : besides nagging government officials , the ladies write letters to boys drafted into the South Vietnamese army urging them to defect , recounting wild tales of the government troops ravaging the folks back home . <P>
