The Methodist Church . Bishop Garfield Bromley Oxnam once hinted , needed both the whirlwind evangelist and the stable , district-bound administrator ; for it owed as much to George Whitefield , who " preached and passed , " as to John Wesley , who " organized and abided . " Methodist Oxnam , who died last week at 71 from bronchial pneumonia , * shared in the qualities of both men . No U.S. Protestant leader of his time preached more ardently about the causes he cared for ; few churchmen were his equal at the homely , slighted arts of governing a district or chairing a conference . <P> Brisk , stocky G. Bromley Oxnam. the liberal son of a politically conservative mining executive , was one of those men to whom success seems as natural as sleep . He was a tennis champion and a football star at the University of Southern California . Assigned to a rundown parish in the Los Angeles slums , he renamed it the Church of All Nations and rebuilt it into one of the showcases of his faith . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1936 and then became , at 44 , the youngest bishop of his church at that time . Oxnam took the honor lightly , and with some wit . Shortly after he was elevated to the episcopacy , a friend began a conversation with " My God , Bishop . . . " " No , " Oxnam interrupted , " it 's Milord Bishop . " <P> Passion for Punctuality . Oxnam was a thorough and energetic church official . In the four areas he directed-Omaha , Boston , New York and Washington-he made it a point to inspect every one o " f his churches from basement to belfry , sometimes at the rate of 25 churches a day . His passion for punctuality allowed him the luxury of additional churchly duties : he served as president of the Federal Council of Churches ( predecessor of the National Council ) and as co-president of the World Council of Churches . <P> A lifelong advocate of leftish causes , Oxnam joined scores of semipolitical groups , including some-such as the Council of American-Soviet Friendship-that were later exposed as Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged on the floor of the House that Oxnam " served God on Sunday and the Communist front for the balance of the week . " Oxnam requested and got a well-publicized hearing from House Un-American Activities Committee , belligerently went through a ten-hour session countering the subcommittee 's sloppily documented charges . At the end , the Congressmen wearily agreed that Oxnam had no tinge of Red . <P> " Exploitation of Man . " Perhaps inevitably , Oxnam developed a fairly wide circle of enemies . He riled businessmen with his comments on the inequities of capitalism , stirred a number of Catholic bishops-including New York 's Francis Cardinal Spellman-to public protest by his angry , blunt attacks on the political aims of Catholicism . Yet his opponents never questioned his moving belief in the brotherhood of man under God .
