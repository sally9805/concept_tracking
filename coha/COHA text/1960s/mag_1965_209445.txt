With an eye to tens of thousands of Spanish-speaking Puerto Ricans in New York City who were disenfranchised by a 44-year-old state law requiring that voters demonstrate literacy in English , New York Senator Robert Kennedy last spring pinned a shirttail amendment on the 1965 Voting Rights Act . Labeled Section 4(e) , it provided that no U.S. citizen could be denied the vote through a literacy test if he could prove he had a sixth-grade education in any " American flag school " - including the Spanish-language schools in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico , where residents have long elected their own Governor and legislature . <P> As a result of Section 4(e) , some 8,000 Spanish-speaking Puerto Ricans registered to vote for the first time in the Nov. 2 elections . Last week , however , a three-judge Federal District Court in Washington ruled that the amendment was unconstitutional . A suit challenging the section claimed that , under Article I of the Constitution , Congress had no right to impose laws governing voter qualifications in any state . Government attorneys had argued that New York violated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disenfranchising Puerto Rican voters , pointing out that Congress acted years ago to encourage cultural autonomy in Puerto Rico by allowing Spanish to be the primary language in school . <P> The majority decision , written by Judge Alexander Holtzoff , 79 , said that the 14th Amendment was beside the point , declared flatly that Section 4(e) " transgresses the powers granted to Congress and , therefore , is repugnant to the Constitution and invalid . " The " appropriate recourse , " said the court , would be an amendment to the constitution of the State of New York . Instead , the Justice Department planned to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court , where a hearing on the full Voting Rights Act is scheduled on Jan. 17 , as the result of another suit .
