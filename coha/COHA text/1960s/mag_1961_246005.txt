Jews like to joke that when three of them get together , they are bound to produce four opinions . As of last week , Jewish leaders with deeply held and vastly differing opinions were involved in a dispute that went to the very heart of Jewry . At immediate issue was the relationship between the U.S. 's 5,500,000 Jews and the proud state of Israel ( pop . 2,115,000 ) . But even broader and greater was an old issue revolving around the meaning and purpose of Jewry . Is Jewishness a religion , a nationality or a peoplehood ? In sum : What is a Jew ? <P> Most passionately engaged in the debate are Israel 's nimbus-haired Premier David Ben-Gurion , 74 , and three key Jewish organizations . The three : <P> The World Zionist Organization , whose U.S. affiliates have 750,000 members . Under the presidency of New York 's Nahum Goldmann , 66 , the Zionists consider themselves the main " bridge " between Israel and the Jews of the U.S. as well as other countries . They argue that a Jew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should feel a strong devotion also to Israel , which he should fulfill with financial contributions , sympathy and emotional attachment . The World Zionist Organization would like to speak for all U.S. Jews-but it does not and can not . <P> <P> The American Jewish Committee , which is " non-Zionist " but friendly to Israel . It has 28,000 dues-paying members , publishes the well-regarded monthly Commentary , and has as its honorary president Baltimore 's Jacob Blaustein , 68 . The American Jewish Committee takes an independent position among Jewish factions - and sometimes gets caught in a crossfire . <P> The American Council for Judaism , which is sharply anti-Zionist and has some 20,000 members . The council stands on the credo of its longtime executive vice president , Rabbi Elmer Berger : " We are Americans by nationality , Jews by religion only . " It was founded in 1943 by 15 Reform rabbis and some 25 laymen , and is supported largely by Pennsylvania 's Lessing J. Rosenwald , philanthropist , art collector and onetime board chairman of Sears , Roebuck &; Co . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen in the U.S. ) , donates relief funds for some of the 1,000,000 Palestinian refugees displaced by the Arab-Israeli war ( $3,000 last year ) . Arabs consider the council an ally , distribute Rabbi Berger 's anti-Zionist pronouncements . <P> In complete concert with none of these organizations is Israel 's Ben-Gurion . Bred in Czarist Poland , Ben-Gurion can not understand how any Jew can possibly be happy or productive living outside Israel . Thus believing that a true Zionist must necessarily commit himself to settling in Israel , Ben-Gurion has branded U.S. Zionists as hypocrites , and has fenced for years on the issue with Zionist President Goldmann . Speaking to the 25th World Zionist Congress in Jerusalem last December , Ben-Gurion threw fresh fuel on the controversy by interjecting a Talmudic passage : " Whoever dwells outside the land of Israel is considered to have no God .
