Life in the Movies A Story by H. E. F. DONOHUE Drawings by Peggy Lloyd W H A T do you want ? " he replied , knowing , from under the pillow to his sister who was whispering in hisses at him through the dark . She was fifteen and still afraid of the dark . I am not afraid of the dark , he reminded himself under the pillow trying not to hear her . She found and flicked on the bright ceiling light . " You 'd better get down there , " she said into his uncovered ear . " The old man 's off again . " He sat up straight and held his breath . There . From two floors down up through two doors around corners along long walls up into the attic room in wisps and curls came his father 's voice , booming . " Please go down , " his sister Grace said . " He might hurt her . " Please , she had said . She was scared . Next she would call hint Michael . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hurt anybody . " " Go down anyway , okay ? " she said . " He listens to you , Michael . " He listens to me . Nobody listens to me . Nobody listens to anybody . Why should I listen to her ? Michael looked at her . She stood in the middle of the room in the middle of the night fully dressed , ready , as she always was , to go , to move out . " What time is it ? " he said . " Almost two , " she said . " Go down , huh ? " Their father 's voice seeped into the room again carrying with it now a funny edge , a tight high straining . " All right , " he said , rolling out of bed . " But he was okay before . " Before , he remembered as he put on sweat socks and started down the stairs shivering in his underwear , everything had been all right after the trouble about the food , which his father did not like too hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always piled everything up on the plate right down in front of you steaming . Good Irish food , she called it , sniffing . She had done that before at supper-time and his father had folded his newspaper muttering and had put it down , as always , without thinking where he was and he had pleasantly plowed right into the boiled cabbage . All that Michael had managed to do was to say Oh-ohhh to himself and reach for the beer . His father had flipped the whole works  --  food plate fork and all  --  back over his head into the kitchen sink . Neat . Then Michael had handed him the beer . The awfully quiet time had been broken up when Grace had tried to laugh  --  she had come out with a little choke . So when the shouting did come , it had only been a loud lecture with a banging on the table about'bcing sworn to a wife for thirty-three years who was still trying to burn out his honest tongue . Then a strange silence had gone on . It had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chess , which they did almost every night , had done for years , 55 would do , where Michael whipped his father easily and heard him talk talk talk about every single thing under the silly sun . But this night he had hardly talked at all . And he had fallen for the rook 's sacrifice to the horse , something lie usually did not do . This night he had said after only a few hours of play : " Enough , enough , Michael-A  --  I am dying up on the vine . " So Michael had gone to his attic room to do the math and stare at Cicero and wonder about the finals of the high-school debate  --  Resolved : That the world be abolished . That had been about nine . Now he was back down again . H E SAW that his mother was not at her usual listening place at the dining-room table brushing away invisible crumbs . She was sunk in the parlor sofa and she wore a confused not a frightened face . When she saw Michael she twitched her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd give to a dumb bus-driver or to somebody , anybody , tracking in free mud . Must I do everything , the look said . Where have I failed , it said . Fah , it said . Then she swung her big eves back at her husband , his father , who was tramping around the room in his bare feet and no shirt over his BVDs , head down as if memorizing the fading changing design of the tattooed rug . He was in a rage . He was walking back and forth so fast and talking to himself so loudly and so hard that he did not notice Michael until Michael , his fifth child , his fourth son , called out : " Hey , what 's up ? " " You stay the hell outta this ! " his father yelled , hitting the short straightaway . Then on the next turn : " I 'll tell you all right ! I 'll tell you what 's up ! " He finished another lap : " The sky is up ! So is every tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he roared , suddenly stopping completely , " is the holy lying land of the free ! " Ile mopped his brow with the back of his hand and spoke to his wife quietly , " Get me another beer , Nell . " " Oh Stephen my ? " she began . " Holy Christ ! " he hollered , deeply speared . " Do not Stephen-Mah-Deah me . Get me a goddam glass of goddam beer ! " She lumbered up and off the sofa and away to the kitchen padding through the dining-room and their lives chittcring . When Michael turned away from watching her go , from the everyday event , from the already fixed and strange and fond scene  --  Oh my darling Mother , Mother ! ? he found his father 's red face puffing a few inches from his , the mouth in a pout , nose heaving , eyes probing suspiciously . Calmly Michael faced back at him . The chill of the November night hadsettled throughout the house , but his father was sweating heavily . The exam , instantly , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old bear in the park cage , angrily , to speak hopelessly between the times he swore . Sometimes he would yell , sometimes scream , Now and then a whisper would come , now and then a wild growing jumping roar . He was speaking of he unfairness of it all and what that means to an alive , an honest man , eager and able to live in this wild world , a world full of fools at best and crawling with conniving rotten bastards at the worst of it . " Why the pattern would be plain to a walleyed paper hanger ! " he cried . " Clear as the clear light of the very first day ! The bastards . The silly goddam bastards . " The trouble , therefore , Michael could decide . had come from outside . It was not food , cold or hot . It was not watered booze . Not warm beer . It was not a credit collector calling him at work . It was not the newspaper being torn before he got it . Nor was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sharp shears , his special nail file , his spotless comb . It was not the windows being unclean , one of which he had brightened once by punting a sidechair through . It was not dust bunching up in corners . It was not simmering stew . None of the household things . None of the family . None of his sons . As he went on speaking it became clear that the trouble had come from outside . He spoke as if the Democratic party had doubted him , as if he had been hurt by Heaven , so that from now on he would have to live a different kind of life . He sounded like somebody else , like a lawyer in the movies fighting for a lonely lost cause  --  explaining , not complaining ; proud if loud : pounding a firm fist into a kind palm ; more hurt , more hopeless , more outraged , than any man since the very first man 's very first fall . The beer came . Michael 's mother took over the sofa again . His father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old upright and spoke to Michael straight . " See that , " he demanded , pointing between and in front of them across the room . H. E. F. Donohue is a free-lance reporter and researcher working in New York on his first novel . His first published story ( " Gentlemen 's Game , " which appeared in " Harper 's " ) was listed in " Best American Short Stories 1959 . " He formerly ran a bookshop in Chicago and was business manager of " Poetry Magazine . " 16 LIFE IN THE MOVIES " Huh ? " Michael said . " That ! " he snapped , stabbing with one tong strong finger . " See that friggin thing ! " " What ? " Michael said , confused . It was in the house then , after all . " That thing ! " his father yelled , jabbing his finger again , parting the air . " There ! " Michael was amazed . His father was pointing at the silent telephone . " See that thing ! " his father said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who pays for it ? " " You do . " " Do I ? " " Sure you do . " " And do I , " his father sweetly said , " do I ever use it , too ? " " No , " Michael said . " Not much . " " Not much , " he repeated , wide-eyed . Then he cried : " Not much ! What the hell are you talking about ! When have you ever seen me use that thing ? " " When Uncle Tim died you talked to Boston . " " What ! What ! Am I surrounded by ninnies then ! And you are the smart guy . Of all among em , you . The smart guy . It is College for you this very next year , huh ? Now what College is going to fall for that ! What College is going to take in such a smart guy ? How in the name of holy hell are you going to make out in this man 's world being so smart ? Why you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Geesus ! Everybody and his brother knows it was your mother called them up there saying Isn't-that-too-bad and Sucha-fine-man and Aa-yah Aa-yah . Smart gay . Get the hell upstairs . I 'm going out on a toot . " " Tell me the trouble first , " Michael said . " I do not think you care . " " I care , " Michael said . His father looked him over for a while . " All right , " his father said , gathering himself . " Get this . If you can . You are the reasonable one . You are the one always yappin about being reasonable . All right . Be reasonable . I ask you , as one reasonable American to another : Have you ever seen me go over to and pick up and use that tell-lee-phone ? " " No . " " No ? " " No . " " All right , " his father said . " Now : Do you use that telephone ? " " Sometimes , " Michael said . " Some times ! Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toy ! And when you get tired you pull strangers in to keep it in shape ! Every-body ! " While his father continued to report correctly and with accurate , sporting gestures and tones how everybody else used the phone , Michael glanced beyond at his mother , who , he knew , was on it at least once every afternoon . She shrugged and coldly closed her eyes halfway down and circled one limp hand around one of her ears . But she leaned forward to listen . " No Sir-ree Sir , " his father was saying , " I never have , and furthermore  --  as you wise College guys would say  --  f have never wanted to use it . Not until tonight . But I did tonight , goddamit . Oh I did tonight . " She spoke : " He tried ? " She stopped . She lowered her head before his glare . " Nothin , " he sadly told Michael . " She does n't know nothin . And give me no lectures please . She not only does n't know anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You are too smart . Like your brothers . Those two . Those heroes . Off to war fighting England 's trouble , And your smart sisters , these two , the silent ones . " He paced about the room once more , along three sides of it , staying away always from the small bench by the foot of the stairs , the built-in bench that held the telephone , circling it and talking at it , always facing it as if , if he looked away , it might move . " It is all a large shame , " he said . The sound of this seemed to make him ponder the words . He also seemed to be counting his toes . He scratched his elbow . " A great big shame , " he told his toes . Michael leaned forward and asked confidently : " What happened ? " " Do n't push me ! " he roared . " I 'm fed up being pushed . I 'll tell you all right . I 'll tell you . You 'll explain it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , always taking the other guy 's side . I do n't care . But I wanted to talk to John Morrisey tonight . I wanted to talk to smart guy John . About something important , something real . About a special job I 've been working on . A new and special section for the Hellcat . They gave it to me three weeks ago . And they have been pushing me . But it takes time and care . That 's why they gave it to me ! But they are pushing , pushing . They want to see . They want to take a test punch . They  --  oh what the hell am I talking for ! Nobody in my own house knows my trade . " " I know some , " Michael quickly said , " because you told it to me . " His father gated at him , not believing . M ICHAEL talked on : " You told me about the test punch . " He rushed through his memory to recall some of the many things his father had told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade , the machinist 's trade . Tempered metals . Cutting tools , the best designed . Male and female . Huge machines under heavy pressure pressing other metals out into the contours of the die . " What was it this time ? " he asked his father . " Two ? Ten ? Twenty tons ? " His father smiled kindly , the patient parent , the wise authority . " Twenty tons ? " he said . " Children 's play . A mere tinker toy . You are not so smart after all , are you , College Boy ? " Michael kept still . You got by that one , Michael Aloysius . There 'll be others . " But I have been informed , " his father formally said , " I have been led to believe by certain of your admirers that you knew just about everything . " Michael waited . Anything could come . " Well , " his father finally said , " you can just forget about the details , College Boy . This is a special job , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day on the telephone . Some about my work you know . Not enough to crowd a thimble . But some . Enough to know I do not want anybody monkeying around with my work until it 's finished , done , and without me there watching what they do . Right ? " " Right , " Michael said , " You 're goddam right ! " he said , working himself up again . " And I am the one to know when ! Right ? " " Right . " " Well everything is wrong . It is not ready yet . Not yet . Not time . Time . Time . Ahhhh ! But Mon-isey . Morrisey ! That famous foreman of mine who is all of thirty-five . Imagine ! Why most of us working there have forgotten more than he ever learned . But he does not care . Not him . All he cares about is pleasing the Navy inspectors and they do not care about anything ! And they want to test punch . They want to test my work on this special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way . This special way . My way . And ? " he cut himself off . " Never mind , " he said . " Yes , " Michael said . " What the hell does that mean ? " his father said . " That 's what I heard from Morrisey this afternoon . I said Son the work is not ready yet for a punch . And he said , Yes . You see , do n't you ? No , you do n't . How could you ? You see , if they take a test punch and something gives , if the female cracks , say , then they will never again try this kind of a job this way . My way . The way I say will work and the way that young engineer who 's even younger than Morrisey , that young engineer straight out of Rensselaer , he says it wo n't . That young engineer  --  I am twice as old , I am more than twice as old as that young engineer . DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well I just wanted to make sure . I left a note . I wrote in the note : Do Not Take Test Punch . Was that reasonable , College Boy ? Was that civilized ? Dignified ? Honest ? Haa ! Fair ? Fair ? " Michael nodded . " You 're goddam tootin it was , " his father said . " But I am a careful man and I wanted to be even more sure . I wanted to be sure he got my note and not some dumb sweeper . I wanted to talk to him and be sure . I thought I 'd just set him straight . I thought I 'd just sashay over to the telephone and call him up . So I went over to it and I lifted it up and 1 tried to use the goddam thing . " " But , " Michael 's mother began , " ' he didret ? " " Shut up Mom , " Michael snapped . " Cut that , " his father said earnestly , spinning on him . " Cut that out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your mother that way again or I 'll club you down . And you , " he said to here " you stay out of this . You had your chance . " " I 'm sorry , " Michael said . " Sorry he says , " his father said . " He says he 's sorry . Who the hell is n't ? That 's what that operator said when I tried to use that phoneSorrreeee . I said Miss 1 wish to talk immediately 58 LIFE IN THE MOVIES with the smiling Mason John J. Morrisey about something very important . And she said in that phony voice of hers **30;1515;TOOLONG ? How do you like that ! " " Well , " Michael started to reply , " she had to ? " " I was under the impression , " his father said ominously , " that you wanted to hear this . " Michael clamped his teeth together and nodded again . " Maybe you are part of the whole thing , " his father said . " They 've got it all fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What-is-hisnumber-please ? I said I am an experimental tool-and-die man , not a member of your monopolistic company . Flow the hell do I know his number-please ? That 's your job . And she said **27;1547;TOOLONG . Little girl , little girl , I have all the facts I need , I was telling her , all I want is Butter-Mouth Morrisey , when this other dame  --  that 's what she was : a dame  --  cuts in and says May-I-help-you ? She talked like she was looking along her nose , like - Mrs . Astor 's horse . Well , I said , that 's certainly up to you , I said , for all I want to do is to have a word or two with Gentleman Jonathan Morrisey called Jack by a few and I am getting pretty goddarn sick and tired telling everybody in your shop that bit of news . And do you know what she said ? She said **32;1576;TOOLONG ? This party . Morrisey , get it ? " He shook his head . Michael nursed him along : " Then what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell cares . I do not want to visit him . I want to repair something before it is broke . For all I know . I said  --  trying to be helpful  --  he lives across the dinky river in Morrisville , or up the pike near Hopewell , or maybe he camps out in the fancy new Pennington section . I do not know , I said , but please PUT THE MAN ON ! And she said I-am-looking . Can such things occur in the capital of a state in the forty-first year of the twentieth century ? Please . Do not answer . No mumbo-jumbo . Do not give me that guff about how anything can happen anywhere . You and your kind only know words . You do not even yet know what it is to wait , had a long wait . While she said she was looking I had a long lonely wait , a patient reasonable man , Professor , and after a long long while she came back on and said I-am-sorrreeee she said , **28;1610;TOOLONG . Do you know what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is young . I said My name is Stephen A. Gahagan here on his paid-up telephone who wants to talk to Mr. Morrisey , thirty-five , so stop all this funny business and connect him right on with me . Then another dame got on and said she was the supervisor and what did I want and I told her and for another long time there was nothing on the wire but my own breathing and then she Caine back on and said there was nothing nobody could do for me . Nobody . Nobody . Nobody . Then she hung up on me . " He snapped his fingers : " Just like that . " He stood still , hands on his hips , feet apart . head down  --  the tough pose of the short little man beaten . Around him and his silence , silence grew . The silence began to fill the room . It went through the house as incense on a hot night goes through a church . A T FIRST the silence had surprised Michael . He had not seen it coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling was over , the story told , the evidence in . No questions , your Honor . Hoo-haa . But where was the moral , Mr. Actor-man , the message , the appeal , the final plea ? Ora pro nohis ! Say something . " What do you want to do ? " Michael asked him , sorry as he said it that he had spoken . For the question seemed to make his father freeze . It made him seem rigid , numb . He shook himself free and shouted with little sound coming out of his wide open mouth , as if clawing his breath , his way , out of an awful dream . " Do ! " he shrieked , strangling . ' ' What the hell can I do ! That thing there , " he choked , lashing one hand at the telephone . " is a fraud ! It works for everybody but me ! " Gradually his voice came back on full , " Why Johnny must have a phone ! I have one and I want to talk to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! What do I want to do ! tell you all right . I 'll tell you what I want to do . I want to rip that friggin thing out by its roots ! " The words made Michael 's mother catch back her breath . The sound caused them to turn . His father turned back . She curled her upper tip at him . Michael turned back , too . His father sat on the piano stool with one foot on his knee rubbing the ankle and cranking around the toes . For a while no one said anything . Then she spoke up in a cheery tone : " All right ! Now it 's all , all right ! " she said . " Fine , " she said , clapping her hands . No one else did anything . She stared at Michael . " Fine , " she said happily . " Everything 's fine . Everybody understands . " Nothing . She glared at Michael . At last he glanced at her . She laughed . " And as the donkey said when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' So I have talked to you . I have talked to you since you were very small . I bet you do n't remember . You came into the room with a big hat on and tried to cheer me up . You recited the whole poem nobody ever knew you 'd learned . ' Let me sit down for a minute , ' you said , and then the whole poem . What a surprise . What were you ? Six , then ? " Michael slowly nodded , Yes . " I never taught anything like that to your two brothers . They knew about words , I guess . They did something instead . Even if it was to leave home . I hope they are not hurt in this war . I never tried to talk to your sisters . But I almost thought for sure I would talk to that other one , to splendid old Kevin . He never missed a trick and he cared about everything and he was very quiet and polite and a little nuts . But you did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognitions sang through Michael 's head and each one said : Oh yes , oh yes , yes , yes , I knew him honored and loved him my beautiful beautiful brother . He shook his head , No . " How old was he , " his father asked the ceiling , " when he died ? Six , then ? " Michael nodded , Yes . Before the age of reason . An angel now in Limbo . Ora pro  --  Michael 's mother made a terrible sound . He would not look at her . " And how old were you ? " his father asked him . " Four ? " Michael nodded once more . " Well , " his father said . He would not look at her , either . He lighted a cigarette . " Well , " he said . He put the cigarette down . " Two holes in the ground , " he said . He stood up . " So all I could ever do after a while was to talk , talk . And tonight I could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is nothing you can do either . But I am glad that you mean well . And you arc a good boy . " H E REACHED for his beer . The glass was empty . But he did not see . He had closed his eyes . He raised it slowly and slowly brought it up to his mouth and slowly tilted it back on his lips and then he opened his eyes when nothing happened and saw that it was dry . He dropped his arm slowly and took his time walking out of the parlor through the dining-room into the kitchen around the corner out of sight . Michael and his mother listened to the familiar sounds as he got out a cold bottle of beer and opened it and poured . " Mary and Joseph ? " she hissed at Michael . 60 LIFE IN THE MOVIES " You certainly rook your sweet time . " Michael looked at her . " All right , " she said , looking away . " I can handle him now . " H I S father catne back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ china closet with the curved glass door and the paper doilies under the plates and saucers and the cut-glass bowls . On top of the closet sat a silver-plated sailing ship under full silver-plated sail and in its round side was an electric clock , which he observed . He put his beer down and took out his flat watch , which he wound , muttering , shaking his head . He picked up his beer again and walked out of the dining-room into the parlor over to the piano stool under which were his shoes and garters and socks . He put his beer down again on the simplified classics and picked up his sacks and tucked one into each shoe and held both shoes by the heels in one hand and picked up his beer with the other and he turned and gave one last look at the undisturbed telephone . Michael spoke to him . Michael said : " Go ahead . " " What ? " his father said . " Rip it out , " Michael said . " What ? " his father said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " Sure , " Michael said . Then his father understood . He put down the beer , dropped his shoes , and in two wide strides got to the phone . He clamped his hands on it , lifted , and pulled . Nothing happened . " Here , " Michael said , moving to him . " Oh no-no , " she said . " Pull ! " Michael said . And an instant before his father pulled , Michael tore the wire From its black wall-box and turned to unwind the wire from his hands to see his father totter backwards into the center of the room clutching the telepho'ie to his big belly . He got his balance back , pivoted , and strode to the front door . When his hand touched the knob , he stopped . Michael 's mother moaned : " Merciful heaven ! Two of them ! " His father had not heard . He was occupied . He was held by the hand holding the phone which he now held high , glancing down along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forth along the floor . He stared again at the instrument in his hand . He seemed surprised to see it there . He turned and walked to the middle of the room carrying it carefully so it would not break and carefullyplaced it in the center of the floor . Then he went back to the piano for his shoes and socks and beer and turned around and headed straight at Michael , his eyes narrow and the bones in his face working . When he got quite near he peered closely into Michael 's face , piercing , intent , as if it were an enemy map . He squinted at him . He scowled . Michael thoughtfully looked into his father 's face , wondering : Why can I only see one eye at a time ? How many of mine does he see ? His father stopped staring at him and walked around him to the stairs , saying as he tramped up into the darkness : " I sleep to work to pay for everything around here . " Michael waited For him to slam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he could hardly hear it close . Nothing budged . He waited for a short time , then he knelt and flicked his fingers across the torn wire drooping from the wall . Nothing . It was made up of three small wires and they were all bright , different colors : red and dark green and light blue . He wondered if anyone else knew . He wondered if a light or something was buzzing in an office somewhere . telling . His mother knelt beside him . " Will they take it away from us ? " she whispered . " I can tape it up again , " he said . " Go to bed . " " What on earth . " she hissed , " ever made you do a thing like that ? " He waddled around on his knees until he faced the telephone a few feet away in the center of the floor . She turned around on her knees , too . They heard Grace creeping down the stairs behind them . " What 's going on , kiddies ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wrapped her nightgown around behind her knees and knelt with them in their tight semicircle . Then she saw the telephone . " Oh , " she whispered , " that 's just great . " " He 's crazy , too , " his mother whispered , nodding at him . " No , I 'm not , " Michael said . " Well , " Grace said , " the old man sure as hell is . " " Grace ! " her mother said , " do n't you ever let me hear ? " " Well , " Grace said , gently hugging her mother , " the old man sure is . " " No , " Michael said , " he 's not , either . " " You both are , " his sister said , looking beyond her mother at hint . " Everybody is . " " Maybe , " Michael replied , gratefully , indebted to her . " Maybe . But he isn't.
