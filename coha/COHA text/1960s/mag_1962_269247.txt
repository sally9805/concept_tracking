To many doctors , the incident is becoming distressingly familiar . A child , usually under three , is brought to the office with multiple fractures-often including a fractured skull . The parents express appropriate concern , report that the baby fell out of bed , or tumbled down the stairs , or was injured by a playmate . But X rays and experience lead the doctor to a different conclusion : the child has been beaten by his parents . He is suffering from what last week 's A.M.A. Journal calls " the battered-child syndrome . " <P> Psychopathic Personalities . There is no indication that the ancient ritual of child beating has been mitigated by modern theories of child raising . Parents continue to kick and punch their children , twist their arms , beat them with hammers or the buckle end of belts , burn them with cigarettes or electric irons , and scald them with whatever happens to be on the stove . Gathering documentation from 71 hospitals , a University of Colorado team headed by Pediatrician C. Henry Kempe found 302 battered-child cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 85 suffered permanent brain damage . An accompanying Journal editorial predicts that when statistics on the battered-child syndrome are complete , " It is likely that it will be found to be a more frequent cause of death than such well-recognized and thoroughly studied diseases as leukemia , cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy . " <P> Although the Colorado doctors found that " beating of children is not confined to people with a psychopathic personality or of borderline socioeconomic status , " as is often thought , the beatings usually indicate psychologically disturbed parents . Occasionally a child beater will admit and even boast of the beatings , but in most cases the parents deny any responsibility for the injury , and voluntarily bring the child for treatment , often to a different doctor after each successive beating . Parental denial of any wrongdoing reinforces a doctor 's natural hesitance to consider child beating as the cause of injury . Detection may be further hampered by the child 's inability to speak for himself . <P> Physician 's Responsibility . But switching doctors , falsifying medical histories and feigning concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kempe report : " To the informed physician , the bones tell a story the child is too young or too frightened to tell . " Since child beating is almost always repeated , X-ray signs of fractures in different stages of healing are almost always a strong indication of parent-inflicted injuries . " The radiologic features are so distinct . " say the Colorado doctors , " that other diseases generally are considered only because of the reluctance to accept the implications of the bony lesions bone injuries . " <P> The A.M.A. Journal report argues that doctors must overcome this reluctance , must be ready to assume responsibility for the safety of the child . Objective and well-documented evidence should be submitted to legal authorities . " Above all , " concludes the report , " the physician 's duty and responsibility to the child requires a full evaluation of the problem and the guarantee that the expected repetition of trauma will not be permitted to occur .
