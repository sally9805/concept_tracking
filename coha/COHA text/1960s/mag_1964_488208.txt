On December 21 , 1963 , at tiny B'nei Yakov Bridge  --  in Ottoman and Mandate Days , it was the majOr transit point on the Tiberias-Damascus highway  --  eleven Israeli prisoners were exchanged for eighteen Syrian prisoners . Supervising United Nations personnel stationed at the now-little-used ' bridge observed that the faces of seven of the Israelis were apathetic masks , and that the men were totally oblivious to their surroundings . While UN officers were escorting him over the Jordan River to the Israeli side , Reuven Liebes , who had spent the previous eleven years in Syrian prisons , suddenly shouted : " It was unbelievable . It was too horrible for words . There are ' still more of them back there . " M the moment , on that Piece of neutral ground in northern Galilee , Liebes was considered " the maddest of the lot . " As it ' developed , however , Liebes was invincibly sane ; he returned to engineering School , became engaged and , miraculously , picked up where he had left off eleven years earlier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge were , according ' to Israeli psychiatristS , hopelessly insane , in a state of complete mental and physical ruin from treatment suffered during periods varying from five to eleven years in Syrian prison camps . The story behind the prisoner exchange at B'nei Yakov Bridge was withheld by Israeli authorities pending an examination of the returnees by the Red Cross or the UN World Health Organization . In order to leave no doubt as to the barbarisms heaped on the men , Israeli authorities asked these organizations to inspect the prisoners and issue a report on their condition . Refusal came first from the Red Cross , which . explained that it could not , as a matter of policy , become involved in a political dispute . The WHO then declined to act on the ground that such investigations did not fall within its jurisdiction . Continuing to withhold the details of ' the men 's condition and treatment , Israel then attempted to convene an international panel of psychiatric experts . But one English doctor 's schedule was too tight , and one Swiss doctor could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ficers ' abroad were informed- that the probable " political repercussions " prevented foreign experts from accepting the invitation , their governments not wanting to become involved , in so delicate an affair . ' So , ' by last spring , the plan for issuing an ' objective report by some international psychiatric board was dropped . Israeli psychiatrists then issued a terse statement noting that the seven former prisoners , all now in mental hoSpitals , were " completely insensitive to reality , " " severely disoriented , " " unable to give organized details of their imprisoninent , " and in such advanced psychotic : states as to make an eventual rehabilitation " unlikely . " Liebes , however , remembered everything , and psychiatrists came to regard him ' as a living refutation of the English penal code dictum that after ten ' years as a POW no man can be expected to have his faculties intact . Liebes told officials and doctors , with what is described as " extraordinary accuracy as to times and dates , " how he learned Arabic and English dUring his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ailer s ' ' oft-repeated contentions that the Israel Government , when the ' Syrians announced their desire to return him , had replied that it did not want Liebes back . The 30-year-old Liebes was born in Poland , where his parents were soon killed by the Nazis , and where he endured the war in a number of hiding places . After being fanned out to various camps and orphanages , he arrived in Israel in 1951 at the age of 17 . The following year , in 1952 , he was abducted ha a Syrian border raid . Liebes told questioners , of " routine , beatings " with a whip on the soles of the feet ; of setting wild dogs on the prisoners ( which drove one of his fellows insane ) ; of bodies smeared with honey and staked out in the sun at the mercy of flies ; of electric shock applied to ' the genitals ; of pummelings by new guards every time a new Damascus regime swept into power ; of solitary confinement , sometimes extended as long as three months ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men went mad from an untreated ' rupture which over a nine-year period developed to the size of a watermelon ) . ? Psychiatrists are ' still ? talking to Liebes , trying to determine what strength of character kept him October 19 , 1964 together- , for ' eleven fantastic years , When this ' comrades , none of whom had been imprisoned for as long , disintegrated one by one . The prisoner swap at the B'nei Yakov Bridge had been in the making for more than ten years . During this time Israel , through the UN Mixed Armistice Commission , sent dozens of letters to Syria , requesting a prisoner exchange . The Syrians denied holding the men whose names appeared on the Israeli lists ; at the same time , they refused UN Or Red ' Cross officials access to the prisons , in Palmyra and Damascus where intelligence reported that the Men would be found . Even a Security Council request for the prisoner swap was rejected by the Syrian authorities , who continued to claim that they held no Israeli prisoners . The existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israeli turncoat , who had broadcast in Arabic from Radio Damascus and had - later settled in Czechoslovakia , underwent a change of heart and sent Israeli officials the names ' - 'of fifteen or so Israeli prisoners whom he had seen . In ' confirmation , hired ' Arab informants provided lists bearing almost the identical names . ' Early in 1963 , Syria ' suddenly announced that it would release eight prisoners . Damascus ' would supply no names , but this was at least an admission , that prisoners were indeed in Syrian hands . At this point Israel held a total of eighteen Syrian prisoners and wanted an approximately equal number in exchange . Damascus countered this demand by , cliarging that Israel actually held fifty Syrians , ' and . stated that all lutist be'returned . Israel termed the number fantastic , but added that six or seven ' deserters from the Syrian army had eventually mar-lied , settled in Israel and taken out citizenship . Upon interviewing these men , the ' UN agreed they could not be forcibly repatriated . The charges and countercharges as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange negotiations to the breaking-off point . The UN then pressed Israel to exchange all the Syrians it held for all the prisoners , the Syrians would release , and the exchange went through under these conditions . Both Israeli and UN observers attested that the returning Syrians were " strong and healthy , wearing good ' clothes " and " able to cross the bridge under their own power . " In addition to Liebes , the only sane Israeli returnee 's were two men and a woman who had had the misfortune , six months earlier , to be in a boat on the Sea of Galilee with three Belgian friends when a sudden storm swept ' them onto the northeast shore line . According to the UN Armistice Agreement , the shore line is in Israeli territory , but the Syrians held the group , releasing the Belgians after two weeks , and holding the others until the prisoner exchange a half year later . Rumors circulated in Israel as to what the Syrian soldiers had done to the woman turned out to be untrue ; the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a few whip- , pings on the soles ' of the feet . - Exactly how some of the Israelis found ' themselves in Syria in the first place is still not entirely clear : two , including Liebes , were soldiers known to have been ' captured in a Syrian border ambush in 1952 ; . two mistakenly ' crossed over in a poorly marked border region , and the stories of the ' others , two of whom had a history of mental illness , are still " unintelligible . " Liebes explained later ' that his outburst on the bridge , far from being ! hysterical , " was designed to impress on the UN people examining me ' that we had suffered inhuman treatment in the Syrian prisons . I felt my making a fuss might prompt ' them to renew their efforts to secure the releaSe of the others . There are still ten more in Syrian prisons " Inevitably , Liebes was asked why he and the others had never tried 2-17 to ' escape . 1-Ie explained that one prison in which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounds , of an army camp ; the other , in Palmyra , was in the middle of the desert , on the Iraqi border . Only two prisoners had tried to escape : One , Liebes said , Was ' found and shot within twelve hours , and the . other " was taught and put on redticed rations in solitary confinement until he died ? " he just wasted away . " - ' Five of the ten Israelis known ' still to be held are feared in - worse condition than those recently returned . As before , the Syrians deny their existence , but it is preSumed that they are being kept for possible bartering in the future . The Red ' Cross is unwilling to investigate their condition in Syria , explaining that it is concerned only with the exchange of War prisoners . ( The fact that Syria never signed an armistice with Israel and still considers itself very much " at war " ap- : parently does not influence the agency 's decision . ) Even the United Nations admits it can do nothing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proper Syrian authorities . " Privately , UN officials acknowledge " almost complete helplessness , " not only in the agonizing prisoner negotiations , but also in its efforts to restrain Syria from constant border harassments around the Sea of , Galilee , which most often take ' the form of firing on farmers and fishermen . " Still , we go on trying , " a UN official said . On which an Israeli army major commented , " Yes , they try , but nothing happens . But then , once the UN stops caring , who else will care ? World opinion has never been an influence , because what is the ' torture and murder of a handful of Israelis , compared to the murder of six million people ? For the six million , world opinion was equally nonexistent , " The only difference is ' that some of these people now are being tortured three times as long as the concentration camp victims . Reuven Liebes endured thirty years so he can finally begin his life now . And perhaps somewhere in Syria there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not merely for three years , but for eleven years . We ca n't afford to waste such people . "
