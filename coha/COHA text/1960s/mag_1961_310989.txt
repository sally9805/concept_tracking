THE DEMONS ( 1,334 pp. , 2 vols. ) - Heimito von Doderer-Knopf ( $13.50 ) . <P> <P> Vienna in the 1920s-with its coffeehouse society making a last whipped-cream stand against change , with the Franz Josef heel-clicks just receding and the Nazi jackboots faintly approaching-is both scene and protagonist of Heimito von Doderer 's two-volume , half-million word novel The Demons , which was 25 years in the writing and two years in translation . The American edition contains a publisher 's list of characters numbering 142 , with 31 starred as principals . <P> The narrator is Georg von Geyrenhoff , a civil servant retired in early middle age who , from the vantage point of the 1950s , sets down the book 's events in reminiscence . The book peers into boudoir and bar , smart rendezvous and thieves ' kitchen , Vienna woods and Vienna sewers , museums , palaces , and slums . There are political riots , murder , sadism , Lesbianism , and varieties of amorous intrigue ; but Von Doderer 's temperament triumphs over passion and violence to give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tableaux vivants , Von Doderer has captured a moment of history , a few years between World Wars , when Vienna thought that tranquillity had been restored , past values retained , that life would move on and , therefore , up . <P> Two Realities in Amber . Like Goethe 's Wilhelm Meister 's Apprenticeship , the ancestor of most German philosophical novels , The Demons is a search for reality . The title refers to a medieval manuscript-discovered in the course of the story and included in toto-that implies that each man 's demon is a second , obsessive , false reality , which he must learn to discard or to unify with his true self . <P> But Von Doderer has failed to make his good document a novel , has done little more than preserve a number of variously interesting flies in an immense sea of amber . <P> The son of a well-to-do railway building contractor , Heimito von Doderer was born and has lived most of his life in Vienna , is considered Austria 's most eminent novelist . He was a prisoner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hitler 's Luftwaffe in World War II . Of his ten books of fiction and five other works , The Demons , meticulously translated by Richard and Clara Winston , is the first to see English . <P> Gravid Times . Von Doderer knows his city intimately and writes of a time when that city was politically gravid . Yet his people have virtually no political awareness . The two political riots in the book do not grow out of the book , they erupt into it . In fact , Von Doderer 's judgment on his people may be that , ignoring the urgencies of their time , they failed to safeguard the best things in it . But half a million is a lot of words in which to make that point obscurely . One wag has dubbed the book " the Ninth Symphony of Viennese gossip . " But it does not resemble Beethoven as much as it does another Viennese , Gustav Mahler . Like Mahler 's symphonies , the book is ambitious , traditional though not conservative , often beautiful , but long rather than large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
