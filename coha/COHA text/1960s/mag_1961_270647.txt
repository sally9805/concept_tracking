One of the State Department 's most persistent domestic headaches is the housing of African envoys in Washington-a city that is Southern by temperament as well as by geography . Last week the problem was very nearly solved , as six Washington real estate men , prodded by President Kennedy , offered to drop color bars in their luxury-apartment buildings . The six : Builders Morris Cafritz , Frank Luchs , Norman and Leo Bernstein , Mark Winkler and Louis Richman . African diplomats , said Norman Bernstein , would be wel come at three of his " restricted " ' apartment complexes : Kew Gardens in Georgetown , Cathedral Mansions on Connecticut Avenue , and Connecticut Gardens in northwest Washington . <P> Satisfied that foreign diplomats would have far less house-hunting trouble from now on , Protocol Chief Angier Biddle Duke admitted that there was still much to be done for Washington 's own Negroes . Said he : " You should n't have to have a passport to get a decent place to live . ' ' Added a hopeful N.A.A.C.P. spokesman : " Ironic as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people from Africa , the American Negro is bound to benefit . "
