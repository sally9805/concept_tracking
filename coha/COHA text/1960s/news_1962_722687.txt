txt The Consolidated Edison Company of New York plans to build the nation 's third largest hydroelectric power plant on the Hudson River , near Cornwall , N. Y. The project , estimated to cost $115,000,000 , also will be the nation 's largest privately owned hydroelectric plant . It will have a pumped storage plant with an installed capacity of 1,350,000 kilowatts . At present , only the Niagara River project , with 2,190,000 kilowatts , and the Grand Coulee Dam on the Columbia River in Washington State , with 1,974 , - 000 kilowatts , exceed the Corn'wall plant 's capacity . Grand ' Coulee is operated by the United States Bureau of Reclamation as part- of the Bonneville Power Authority ; Niagara , by the New York State Power Authority . Technically , the Cornwall plant on the river 's west bank will be a reversible pumped storage plant , the company said yesterday . When demand for electricity is low , , as at night or on weekends , the six 225,000-kilowatt turbines will act as pumps , drawing water from the Hudson and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reservoir . When demand is high during the day , the water will fall vertically down a steel and concrete-lined shaft at the bottom of the reservoir and then laterally , with a slight slope , 7,900 feet to the plant at the bank of the river . The water will then pass through the six turbines , which will then act as generators , to produce electricity . The plant site is in the service area of Central Hudson Gas and Electric Corporation . Power to be generated will be fed into the Con Edison lines through a 345,000-volt transmission line from Cornwall to Con Edison 's Dunwoodie substation at Yonkers . Harland C. Forbes , chairman of Con Edison , told a news conference that the company had been studying such a system for the last 20 years , but that it had become feasible only recently because of improved transmission and other equipment . He described the project as providing the benefits of " a gigantic storage battery on our system . " He also indicated that the project was timely because of stepped-up interconnections between his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cornwall plant would cost about $70 a kilowatt of installed capacity against the $130 to $150 that very large steam units would cost in this area . ' He indicated that the utility " soon " , would file an application with the Federal Power Commission for a license to build the plant ' and said that no delays were expected . In answer to a question he said that the company 's counsel did not think the Army Corps of Engineers ' approval would be necessary since the plant would not interfere with river navigation . The proposed reservoir lies in , a natural depression between ' White Horse Mountain and , Mount Misery southwest of , Storm King Mountain . It will , encompass 230 acres , which is , the equivalent of 17,000 acrefeet or storage for 740,000,000 , cubic feet . The dikes will be from 80 to 350 feet long and the working level of the water will be 150 feet deep . At present , part of the acreage is a reservoir providing water for Cornwall .

He said that no difficulties were anticipated on that matter or in acquiring the land , which he said was held by three or four private owners , including Harvard University . Uhl , Hall &; Rich ; a subsidiary of Charles T. Main &; Co. of Boston , will be the consulting engineer for the project , which is planned to be in operation in 1966 . Mr. Forbes said part of the costs would be in addition to the $1,100,000,000 the utility had budgeted for expansion projects from 1961 through 1965 . The Cornwall project will be by far the largest pumped storage system in this country . The Appalachian Power Company , a subsidiary of American Electric Power System , is building a 400,000-kilowatt pumped storage plant at Smith Mountain on the Roanoke River in Virginia . The Union Electric Company of Missouri is working on its Tam Sauk plant on the Black River in Missouri . It will have a capacity of 350,000 kilowatts .
