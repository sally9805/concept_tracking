Bulgaria 's Todor Zhivkov may still toady to the Kremlin 's foreign-policy wishes ( see above ) , but when it comes to internal matters , he is as reform-minded as any other Eastern European . <P> At the Bulgarian Party Congress last week , Zhivkov proudly detailed " an all-round upsurge " in the nation 's economy - the product of a quiet three-year-old reform experiment that has placed 60% of Bulgaria 's industry on a profit-incentive basis . <P> In factories freed from the rigid grip of central planning , Zhivkov reported output improved and labor productivity nearly tripled . Partly as a result , Zhivkov was able to promise Bulgarians " TV sets , refrigerators , washing machines , vacuum cleaners , cars , furniture " - coupled with a shorter work week ( down from 46 hours to 44 ) and a much needed 7% wage increase across the board . <P> The Yellow Tiles . Sofia , once the dreariest of East-bloc capitals , has already taken on a new vigor and vivacity . A burgeoning fleet of privately owned automobiles now dominates yellow-tiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall-clad street cleaners who once were its only traffic . Red Coca-Cola trucks bustle about town , carting the bubbly produce from three local bottling plants . In such cafes as the Astoria and the Alenmak , where only two years ago the twist was a reform-school offense , big-beat music blares from well-stocked jukeboxes ( current top hit : Get off of My Cloud ) . <P> " It is inevitable , " said a Bulgarian official last week over a Coke . " Our people , especially the young , are influenced by the increasing number of Western tourists who come here . " Since Bulgaria opened its borders to currency-laden <P> Westerners three years ago , 3,000,000 tourists have swept through-most of them to bask in the sun on once-deserted Black Sea beaches , others to visit Sofia 's antiquity-rich hinterland dotted with Thracian , Macedonian and Roman ruins . Recently , Bulgaria , Yugoslavia and Turkey joined in a tourist venture publicizing " historic " Highway E-5-the Roman route to the Near East that later carried Crusaders and pilgrims in their long journey to the Holy Land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road also served the Turkish janizaries in their harsh 500-year occupation of Bulgaria . <P> Shield on the Underbelly . The highway project reflects Bulgaria 's growing interest in cultivating its once-hated Balkan neighbors . Foreign Minister Ivan Bashev visited Ankara last year , recently approved an agreement with Greece to increase trade and tourism . Exulted one Bulgarian in Sofia last week : " The Balkan powder keg is a thing of the past . " Nothing dies harder in the Balkans than ancient history , however , and the Bulgarians are still effusive each year in their thanks to Russia for freeing them from Turkish bondage 88 years ago . What 's more , the Kremlin is pleased to see Bulgaria on a friendly footing with NATO members Turkey and Greece : Sofia is Russia 's shield on the " soft underbelly . "
