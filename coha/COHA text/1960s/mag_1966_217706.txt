THE AMERICAN HERITAGE PICTURE HISTORY OF WORLD WAR II , edited by David G. McCullough ; text by C. L. Sulzberger. 640 pages . Simon &; Schuster. $20 ( deluxe edition : $25 ) . <P> <P> There are at least 14.9 million experts on World War II in the U.S. That is the number of Americans still living , out of a total of 16.3 million , who served in the armed forces during the war . A good proportion of this group will almost certainly find something to carp about in this bulky history-a skirmish ignored , a river crossing forgotten , a campaign brushed off , a battle mentioned only in passing , a hero underrated , a sequence out of order . <P> In a brief introduction , the editors disarmingly acknowledge that they are prepared for such criticism ; they admit that no one book could ever contain the complete history of a global war involving 56 nations . Their aim instead is to present in words and pictures the essential history of the greatest war and try to re-create a feeling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it . By and large , they have succeeded . Although the text by New York Times Columnist C. L. Sulzberger is sometimes stiff and distant , the book contains engrossing eyewitness accounts from such diverse types as a Japanese kamikaze pilot , a Berlin housewife , an Englishman at Dunkirk and a U.S. Marine sergeant on Guam . By far the best value is found in the 720 pictures ( 92 in color ) , which capture the events from the Treaty of Versailles to the rise of Hitler to the Japanese surrender on the deck of the Missouri in 1945 . <P> Commendably , the book never tries to glamorize the war . The pictures of Hiroshima , the faces of Hitler and Goebbels , the stacks of dead at the Gusen concentration camp in Austria , are reminder enough that it was a war in which compassion and decency lay among the victims .
