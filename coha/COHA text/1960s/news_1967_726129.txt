txt That old political throwback  --  the dollar-ayear man ? is trying for a major comeback in California . The new Republican Governor , Ronald Reagan , hopes to dust him off , remold him , reshape him , refit him , refine him , and let him burrow deep into California state government . Governor Reagan and his running mate in the past election campaign , Lt. Gov . Robert Finch , stood at podiums around the state and dreamed aloud of enlisting the private sector heavily in the business of government . They dreamed it would be cost-free to the state . In part it seems to be a dream coming true . Even before he took office , the new Governor persuaded three accounting firms to audit the state 's finances . The three did so ? free . They just finished telling the Governor that they find the state spending $1 million a day more than it takes in . Not all the free help the Governor hopes to enlist is expected to produce such bad news . Mr. Finch , right after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Chad ) McClellan , to set up a statewide private job hunt for men on welfare . Now the McClellan project ? at no cost to the state  --  represents the heart of the Governor 's welfare program . And shortly , Governor Reagan intends to bring some 150 businessmen into government for an intensive 32-week look at various state operations to see how they can be run better for less . Eventually , Mr. Finch predicts , the state will enlist still other troops from the private sector to help govern the state . " We 've got some things in mind , " he says , " but I ca n't announce them yet . " Mr. Finch also says the Reagan administration hopes , after the present university budget-cut controversy dies down , to lure academic personnel in to do research for the state . The Reagan administration hopes to pay for most of these things with a combination of free talent  --  donated by private industry  --  and foundation money . The Governor even asked that state em* // *Reagan seeks to reenlist $liwa-year men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On Lincoln 's Birthday , however , the idea was overwhelmingly rejected when fewer than 200 workers out of 166,000 in the state went to work . A similar result is expected on Feb. 22 , Washington 's Birthday . Governor Reagan is banking on involvement of the private sector in the business of government as the one thing that will perhaps most distinguish his administration . It 's what he means when he talks loftily of a " creative society . " Volunteerism is a basic tenet in the Reagan political philosophy . He says he thinks government is best which is citizen-oriented . He said so over and over in the campaign , and his key appointments reflect this philosophy . Grand-scale talent and problems His staff and departments are sprinkled with citizen types , mostly businessmen and young lawyers with little past political experience , on leave from their jobs . It 's almost as if the whole government is on temporary loan from someplace else , including the Governor . Mr. Finch thinks California is uniquely suited to this kind of grand-scale experimentation with the private sector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and problems on a grand scale . " All the environmental problems we face are so vast today , " he says , " that government alone ca n't hope to solve them anymore . It is not enough for a businessman , for instance , now to say , ' I paid my taxes , let government take care of it . ' We 've got to break out of that bind , beginning with the civil-rights problem . The private sector has just got to assume a greater obligation . " Since Mr. Finch thinks civil rights is the most pressing problem of all , this is getting major attention . It is what the McClellan drive to employ unemployed Negroes is all about . It is why Mr. Finch is heading a Job Opportunity Council to try to retrain unskilled workers on welfare ? most of them Negroes . California 's other major experiment with the private sector  --  the plan to enlist a team of businessmen to put state government under a microscope  --  is n't unique . Washington and Ohio have both done it in recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departments and recommend new ideas . The ploy wound up saving the state $75 million to $80 million the first year and about $60 million in recurrent years . The same Chicago consulting firm that set up the Washington and Ohio plans  --  Warren King &; Associates ? has been called in to help California . Mr. King himself has been snooping around the Capitol staking out areas of potential study . Hotel men invited California will launch its **33;87;TOOLONG program within the next month and a half . Then for 32 weeks some 150 businessmen will spread out in teams through California government looking for ways to run things better and save money . Since California , for instance , beds down more people than anybody else in the country , hotel men will come in for a look . Sandy Quinn , a key Reagan aide , explains it this way : " We will say to a big hotel chain , for instance , ' Look , you have a trouble shooter who goes around to recommend how you can improve your operations and save money . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state is also a major purchaser of things . So purchasing experts from the outside will come in and tell the state how to purchase better for less . The Reagan administration met with more than 100 corporation presidents and board chairmen in Los Angeles in early February . Those executives have since pledged among them more than 100 of their top-level people to the project  --  free of charge . A big-name chairman to oversee the project will be picked shortly and will probably spend most of his time for the next six months in Sacramento coordinating the project . His salary : 50 cents probably . Some things government does just do n't lend themselves to business methods . They involve things more human and intangible than cost control , quality control , and the profit motive . No matter what a businessman wants to do , he ca n't do inuch about hiring or firing or moving around a civil servant . Business measures ca n't define a needy child . But the Governor 's chief staff aide , Philip M. Battaglia , thinks some of the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fused in for a more efficient operation . And that 's what he intends to pay the new gang of dollar-a-year men to do .
