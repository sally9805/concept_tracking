Early Winter Roundup Film comedy takes a welcome turn with the arrival of Goldfinger , made from an Ian Fleming thriller . Fleming may have intended his books as sex-and-sadism stimulants , though they arc so dreadfully written that I have never been able to find out ; but the first two Fleming films were headed in the direction of comedy . They were impeded ( in Dr. No ) by too much sci-fi hocus-pocus out of Saturday afternoon serials and ( in From Russia With Love ) by too heavy a reliance on the personality and sexual exploits of the cloddish Sean Connery . Goldfinger , with a new director , Guy Hamilton , strikes exactly the right note . Connery , still miscast as Bond , a dressed-up stevedore in a role that calls for a young Cary Grant , is not taken any more seriously as a libertine than he is as a sensible detective ; and all the apparatus is now hilariously melodramatic rather than supposedly frightening . ( Example : Bond is strapped to a metal table by the villain and a laser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buzz-saw . ) But it is neither straight satire of private-eye eyewash nor surrogate fulfillment of adult repressions . The acting is too straight for the former and the plot too extreme for the latter . ( When Bond embraces a girl , he sees in her eyes the reflection of an assailant approaching from behind . ) Bond can not be a vicar of violence for us because , although the details of his behavior are generally credible , his decisions and the context of his actions are absurd . He reminds me of a swimmer I once saw on a docksmall compared to gains won . Given resources of civil rights forces , steady application of their energies ought to accelerate the recent rate of progress . FILMS drying himself with a towel , in perfectly normal fashion , in the midst of a rainstorm . That is Bond , as character ; Goldfinger , as film , is neither satire nor release but a pleasant travesty of adolescent daydreams . In contrast , a comedy called John Goldfarb , Please Come Home is doggedly unfunny . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hero is an American U-2 pilot , Jewish , who loses his course for Russia and is forced down in an Arab oil kingdom . Shirley THE NEW REPUBLIC MacLaine is a US news photographer who has smuggled herself into the king 's harem . Goldfarb has been a football coach , and the king spares him on condition that he help the prince , a Notre Dame football reject . The State Department , in order to cover up the U-2 landing , agrees to arrange a game between the Arabs and Notre Dame . The dialogue by William Peter Blatty may be witty ; we shall never know because , in the main , it is incomprehensible . The film never has a chance because it is directed by J. Lee Thompson who showed a dull hand in What A Way to Go ! and here dulls it further . Like all untalented people attempting farce , he thinks the prime element is speed ; everything is done very fast . In fact the prime elements are timing ( by no means the same thing as speed ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can not possibly laugh at payoffs . In addition , Thompson has no gift with actors . Miss MacLaine has never been so unendearing in her attempts to endear , Richard Crenna is a void as Goldfarb , and even Peter Ustinov , who ought to have been funny since he is simply repeating his familiar bumbling act with an Arab accent , has been allowed to blur . Bay of the Angels , directed by Jacques Demy , is a thin and ultimately false French film about gambling , but it contains two elements of note . From time to time , in the casinos of Nice and Monte Carlo , it catches some of the fever and helps you to understand the gambling passion of Dostoevsky and others . And it contains another vivid and interesting performance by Jeanne Moreau , dyed blonde , neurotic , with consciousness of and dedication to her neurosis . Three films about marriage by two directors . Andre Cayatte , whose distinctions include We Are An Murderers , has made his own double feature , called Anatomy of A Marriage , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man 's view in one full-length film and from the wife 's in the other . The idea is very watery Pirandello ( contradictions can both be true ) but might have been successful if the trick had been condensed to one film ; and if the characters were significant , the events reasonably representative of the problems of modern married life , and the colorings not predominantly soap-opera purple . The Pumpkin Eater is by Jack Clayton who made the extraordinarily good Room at the Top and then made the mistake of attempting James 's Tura of the Screw ( as The innocents ) . Here , with Harold Pinter as his adapter , he has taken a plush-lined ladies ' novel by Penelope Mortimer and taken it seriously . A woman has a compulsion to have children , has a large number by two husbands , falls in love with another man , divorces her husband , and in effect drives her new husband to intensify his philandering by her philoprogenitive craze . This , it seems to me , is a subject for comedy , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like Kim Stanley , went to England to make her most recent film , comes off less well than Miss Stanley because her role is principally one of dreary noble suffering . Peter Finch , the Rip Van Winkle of actors , seems almost to have awakened from his long sleep and may one day once again be worth watching . There are two sharp moments . James Mason has a scene , as a married friend , in which he plays a descending scale from amiability to vicious sexual aggression ; and there is a beauty parlor scene in which Miss Bancroft , trapped under a hair dryer , has to listen to a demented monologue from a woman next to her . The monologue is well written and is excellently played by Yootha Joyce . It has only one defect : it is totally irrelevant to the story . For the rest , Clayton strains for muted meanings by taking us on extended tours of the furnishings of various rooms . Clayton and Cayatte suffer from a prevalent directorial disease ( shared by Leopoldo Torre Nilsson ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their judgment of material . Some directors choose feeble material out of desperation . ( After I saw Karel Reisz 's poor version of Night Must Fall , I asked a well-known director why , after the opportunities opened up by Saturday Night and Sunday Morning , Reisz had chosen to remake this old thriller . " Probably he just waited too long , " said the director sympathetically , " and got panicky . " ) Often it is simply weak editorial ability . It is increasingly clear that this ability and directing talent do not necessarily go hand in hand . There are a few directors who make films as many other artists work ? that is , as expressions of an organic vision of life , perhaps a philosophy . That is why one can forgive most of Bergman 's lapses ; they are usually attempts , however unsuccessful , to dramatize an evolving personal view . But most directors simply shop for usable material , from film to film ; and some of the most capable make some of the worst choices . STANLEY KAUFFMANN  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
