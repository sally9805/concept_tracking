The three square-headed giants had no eyes and indeed no faces , but they somehow lived up to their name , The Watchers . Elsewhere in Manhattan 's Knoedler Galleries last week , a Lion seemed to roar through a megaphone mouth , eerie beasts trotted around on spiky iron legs , and headless winged figures danced an unearthly ballet . The menagerie was the work of a burly , mussed-looking man named Lynn Chadwick , at 46 a major talent in the new wave of British sculptors who followed , but did not take after , the great Henry Moore . <P> Chadwick first heaved into public view shortly after World War II , in which he had served as a pilot with the Fleet Air Arm . He had by then given up an early ambition to be an architect because he wanted to work on his own without having to meet the demands of clients , contractors and zoning laws . Unsure where his tastes and talents lay , he began by cutting out mobiles , only to find the shapes too " rigid " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clarke , his most notable English contemporaries , Chadwick took to the welding torch . <P> His sculptures happen to look something like beasts , birds and people , but any resemblance is pretty much coincidental . Convinced that " art school makes you think rather than feel , " Chadwick taught himself , and approaches his art much as an action painter would . He tries to suspend conscious thought in developing his forms because " the subconscious has the larger vocabulary . " He works rapidly with wire and metal rods , allows his construction to grow almost as if it had a goal of its own . If the construction does not please him , he can correct or discard ; if it does , he fills it in like flesh over bones with a plaster made of gypsum and iron powder . <P> The only mechanical part of the whole process is the making of two or three legs-or perhaps four : " That 's a beast or two people . " The titles are an afterthought , for Chadwick 's purpose is not to express any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . " But I want my work to be considered for itself . What interests me is the physical result , the form , the object rather than the idea . " Then why bother with making legs at all ? Answers Chadwick : " One must start from somewhere or else there is chaos . And I could n't stand the strain myself . "
