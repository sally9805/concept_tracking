You will see that this little clicking contraption with the revolving handle will make a revolution in our life . . . It is much better than the heavy , long-drawn-out kind of writing to which we are accustomed . . . The cinema has divined the mystery of motion . And this is greatness . <P> So said Leo Tolstoy in 1908 , when he was 80 , peering into the future of an infant art . He might have altered his opinion had he seen this Russian adaptation of his masterwork , War and Peace . It has escaped greatness , except in cost and length . The film took $100 million and five years to make . After extensive cutting it is now six hours and twelve minutes long . In the Soviet Union it was released in four different segments ; in the U.S. , audiences must see it at two separate showings . <P> The movie is awesome in war and pusillanimous in peace . For a single engagement , Director Sergei Bondarchuk could deploy 120,000 troops-supplied by the Soviet government , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as art . And Bondarchuk makes the most of his forces . Cavalries plunge and break in tidal waves ; columns of infantry writhe to the horizon and beyond ; choruses of cannons shout like narrow mouths of hell in a series of vivid instants that recall the trancelike battle paintings of Uccello . With a knowing artist 's eye , the director composes vignettes reminiscent of the harshness and heartbreak of Goya etchings . Again and again , the dolor and grandeur of Russia 's convulsive struggle with Napoleon provide a panorama truly worthy of Tolstoy , a writer who did not believe in leaving anything out . <P> But in the book , the war was only the background framing the twin heroes , Prince Andrei Bolkonsky ( played by Vyacheslav Tikhonov ) and his friend Pierre Bezukhov ( played by Director Bondarchuk ) , who represent the two faces of the aristocracy . The outlines of the plot are familiar even to those nonreaders who saw the 1956 miniversion , with Audrey Hepburn , Mel Ferrer , and Henry Fonda . Andrei , a sophisticate and soldier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war . Pierre , muddling through the chaos around him , does nothing right , but because he has the capacity to grow and change , he survives . Between the two flutters the lissome Natasha ( Ludmila Savelyeva ) as she grows from spritely adolescence to tragic womanhood . <P> It is in the telling of their lives that the film fails . Pierre and Andrei are at best only shallow , literal representations of Tolstoy 's rich characters . To portray Natasha 's giddiness , Savelyeva never walks when she can dash , never smiles when she can give shiny-eyed grins that reduce her to a caricature coquette . Amateurish cutting and arbitrary shifts from color to black and white mutilate the film . Moreover , the dubbing is disastrous : the actors ' faces show feelings far more profound than the dull words that can not quite fit their mouths .
