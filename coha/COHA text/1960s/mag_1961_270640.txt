Wild Life ? <P> <P> Sir : <P> As your July 14 cover story " Ah , Wilderness ? " suggests , Daniel Boone would be ashamed of the present-day luxury-laden camper . <P> Two years ago , we embarked on a rather rugged hitchhiking tour of the western U.S. Although traveling with only knapsacks on our backs , we found room for a stove , transistor radio , camera and a fishing pole . <P> After 2 months and 10,500 miles , we ended our wheelless camping trip , which led us into 17 states and Canada . <P> Paraphrasing your question , we say of TIME 'S article , which revived many memories of pampered campers we met on our adventure : " Ah , wonderful ! " <P> <P> TOM GRIMM JON BEYER Peoria , Ill . <P> <P> Sir : <P> Your Virgil Partch cartoon amused me greatly , because it is not so far from the truth . I watched my mother hook up her electric blanket to the overhead light in one of the permanent tents at Yosemite National Park last summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a.m. that the extra warmth was quite welcome ! <P> <P> PATRICIA MUSTEN National City , Calif . <P> <P> Sir : <P> <P> Your article reminded me of a verse that my stepfather once wrote after a disappointing visit to Yellowstone : <P> The thing to do in Yellowstone Is to leave the grizzly bears alone , Find a geyser , watch it spout , Express surprise , and drive on out . <P> <P> MARY DAMEREL Cambridge , Mass . <P> <P> Sir : <P> Your two-page cover panorama brings to mind some of the unfortunate experiences we have had , but suddenly they seem a lot funnier than they did at the time . <P> <P> MAHLENE FRITSCHI Los Angeles <P> Sir : <P> In our five years of family camping ( mostly weekends , I admit ) solitude is harder and harder to find each year . We are so grateful for the rare areas that allow primitive camping ( box toilets and a pump ) and an opportunity not to hear your neighbor snore and his baby cry . Acreage is what we need more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PATRICIA H. FITT Washington , D.C. <P> <P> Sir : <P> Over the years it has come to my attention that the original material for TIME 'S cover is sometimes given to the person pictured thereon . <P> Having identified myself , having been identified by my wife ( reading TIME while she does all the work ) , and having been identified by my children ( departing from tent not entirely clad ) , I am curious to know what disposition is intended of Artzybasheff 's original drawing for this issue . If one of the many others also shown in the picture has not already staked his claim , will you consider mine ? <P> <P> CHARLES G. WILLIAMSON JR . <P> <P> Washington , D.C. <P> The line forms at the gatefold. - ED . <P> <P> Sir : <P> I was immediately struck by the resemblance of the July 14 cover illustration to that of a Flemish painting entitled The Garden of Earthly Delights , a 15th century masterpiece by Hieronymous Bosch . <P> I find them similar in subject matter , the pursuance of pleasure , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this comparison is more than a far-fetched coincidence as the action shown in both cases is by no means identical . But one can not deny that both boil down to the same idea : the important role that pleasure plays in the life of man . <P> <P> CAROLE BERGMAN <P> New York City
