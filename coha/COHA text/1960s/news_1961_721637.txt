txt Washington , Jan. ** a move to halt the drain on American g o 1 d reserves , President Eisenhower today ordered United States citizens and companies to dispose of gold holdings abroad by June 1 . Under the order , American citizens and companies are barred from holding gold or gold securities deposited abroad , which means they cann .. t buy or keep gold . It is not known how much in dollars is involved in the White House executive order . It is known , however , that Americans have been speculating in gold in the London and Toronto markets , and that they have had to keep their InAlion and certificates abroad , because private citizens and companies are barred from holding gold in the United States . Available to Foreigners Foreign countries can and do have gold holdings in this country . These can be withdrawn from Fort Knox or bank vaults by the governments , which may , directly or indirectly . be acting for individual owners . American purchases abroad have contributed in a measure to the outflow of gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more than a year . The flow lhas been due in part to the fact that this country has been spending more abroad than other countries have been spending here . U. S. OK 's London Sales In order to keep the London market near the official American price of $35 an ounce , the treasury has been approving gold sales in the London market by the Bank of England . The bank has purchased gold from the United States to make up for the price-pegging gold released in the London market . In 1960 , foreigners purchased 2 billion dollars worth of American gold , which Americans themselves can not buy . In the first two weeks of 1961 , foreigners bought 200 million dollars worth of gold . American gold stocks n o amount to 17 billion 600 million dollars , their lowest level in years . In 1957 the stocks Were 23 billion , which means they have dropped 5 billion 400 million in three years . Must Preserve Dollar " It is not believed that a large amount of gold is being held abroad in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , since individuals and enterprises subject to the jurisdiction of the United States are not permitted to hold gold in the United States . it is reasonable to prohibit such holdings abroad where purchases generally represent an outflow in the United States balance of payments . " The prohibition of such holdings ' also underlines the fact that gold today represents principally a means of settling international payments between individual foreign countries . " The White House also said The ban on overseas gold holdings by Americans is another step toward " taking ' all possible measures to assure the strength of the United States ' dollar as the cornerstone of the internatonal monetary system . " The Eisenhower order amends an executive order issued in August , 1933 , by Franklin D. Roosevelt , then President , prohibiting citizens in this country from holding gold . The President last November ordered drastic cuts in the number of military dependents to be sent abroad lin an effort to stem the gold drain and improve the balance of payments .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
