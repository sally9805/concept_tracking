txt Governor Rockefeller today accused Dr. Albert H. Bowker , Chancellor of the City University , of raising " fictitious " issues in barring 2,300 students from admission next fall for the lack of space . The Governor told Dr , Bowker , in a letter made public here , to " insist " that the city administration make available all the state funds allotted to the university . He asserted that Mayor Linday 's proposed budget did not include *5-million in state aid intended for the university . In . New York , Mayor Lindsay vigorously denied tonight the Governor 's contention . He declared in a statement from City Hall : " The Governor in his letter to Chancellor Bowker is inaccurate with respect to the money needed by the City University and , in any event , misses the whole point . " In his letter to Dr. Bowker , the Governor also made it clear that he would not support two Democratic bills that would increase the state 's share of aid // Speaker Anthony J. Travia , the Assembly 's top Democrat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they learned of the Governor 's letter , which was distributed in a news release . The Speaker worked . late with his staff to come up with an answer to the Governor . ' Senator Ohrenstein said that the Governor 's contention that there was no need of a construction fund , the state was already oligated to pay 50 per cent of building costs was " preposterous " and " totally misleading . " The whole purpose of the fund , he said , would be to take university construction out from under the debt ceiling , just as the state has done in the case GOVERNOR SCORES STAND BY BORER // for the City University and establish a $400-million construction fund for expanding the complex of four senior colleges and six community colleges in New York City . Mayor Lindsay appealed yesterday for Mr. Rockefeller 's support for the bills . The Governor 's implied " no " ' today sets the- stage for a bruising battle with the Democratic supporters of the bills . But the Mayor in his statement tonight reiterated that the bills were " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-term commitments but to be able to provide educational opportunities for the 2,300 students it has had to reject this year . " Mr. Lindsay 's position thus put him on the side of the Democratic legislators in their fight with the Governor over the bills . Governor Rockefeller contended in the letter that the state has already made provision for the needs of the City University ? His ' $64.4-million budget for the City University , he said , contains the $5-million that the university said it needed to accommodate the students . And as for future construction , the Governor went on , the state since 1960 has been prepared to pay 50 per cent of the principal and interest expense for expansion . ' No Justification ' " Thus , " he wrote , " there is no need and no justification for denying 2,300 qualified young people admission to the City University this fall , and it is most unfortunate that these young people and their families have been so needlessly and cruelly upset and that the public has been so grievously misled . " Two weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university would prevent the acceptance of these students . All would have been accepted last year . The chancellor contends that even if facilities could be found to house the freshmen in the fall , the university would not be equipped to educate them when they become juniors and seniors . Dr. Bowker reiterated his position in an answering letter to Governor Rockefeller today . " In the present budget there is not enough money for either construction or instruction , " he wrote . " I mean no disrespect to the Governor , but I should be derelict in my duty if I did not press for both , and I insist that 2,300 ' students can not be properly handled with our present resources . " As for the extra $5-million Governor Rockefeller said the city already had , Dr. Bowker said he would study the discrepancy " without delay . " Statement by Lindsay In his statement , Mayor Lindsay said that the crisis confronting the City University involved more than just operating expenses . " The City University has rejected 2,300 qualified students for next fall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient facilities to assure their full four-year education . " Only if a realistic expansion program is instituted this year and additional operating expenses are forthcoming will it be possible to admit these qualified students . The Ohrenstein bills now pending before the Legislature meet both of these conditions . " Then , on the $5-million budgetary discrepancy charged by the Governor , the Mayor said : " Our best estimate of the amount that will be available , from the state to the city in the coming year is $54.8-million . The Governor . we believe , sub-I stantially overestimates they money the city will receive. , Nothing beyond the ? present , formulas is available to the City University without additional legislation . " However , in view of the Governor 's surprising statement , I hope he will direct his budget staff to meet with my budget director and resolve their different estimates . " At any rate , Dr. Bowker has said that the $5-million would still not open the university 's doors to the rejected students , since they would only face a " dead end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern , observers felt , was for legislative approval of a $400-million City University construction fund . As set up in a bill by Senator Manfred Ohrenstein , Democrat of Manhattan , the fund would be created from equal city-state contributions of up to $200 per student .
