" I 'm not a commercial person , " said Brian Epstein . " I 'm a frustrated actor . " <P> He was , in fact , a spectacular commercial success . As discoverer-manager of the Beatles , he personally earned $14 million in five years . Yet he was right about his life ; it was the ache of being a failed actor and an outsider among the Beatles that most pained Epstein . <P> One morning last week his body was found in bed by his valet in his town house around the corner from Buckingham Palace . He was 32 . Police uncovered " no suspicious circumstances , " but no natural causes either . He had been ill with mononucleosis , but that disease is almost never fatal . So a coroner 's inquest was ordered , with a verdict due this week . One speculation : <P> Epstein may have died inadvertently from a combination of alcohol and the barbiturates found on his bedside table . <P> " Something Big .

The army discharged him after twelve maladjusted months ; he got nowhere at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts . He was 25 before he made a go of something-running one of his family 's record departments . <P> One day in 1961 , a customer asked for a record made in Germany by a group called the Beatles . When Epstein discovered they were playing near by in a joint named The Cavern , he took a squint .

Yet I recognized the appeal of their beat , and I rather liked their humor . I sensed something big-if it could be at once harnessed and at the same time left untamed . " That was Brian Epstein 's life work : organizing the unruly Merseyside boys , adding some professional polish , and making them wash ( but not cut ) their hair regularly . When they finally clicked after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt fulfilled . " My own sense of inferiority , " he said , " evaporated with the Beatles . " <P> The bourgeois manager never did swing with the zesty , remarkably creative Beatles . A slightly dandified bachelor , he kept pretty much to himself ; he said recently that he had made five LSD trips in one 14-month period . Asked once what he feared most in life , he replied : " Loneliness . I hope I 'll never be lonely , although actually , one inflicts loneliness on oneself . " <P> Mystic Cult . With the Beatles cutting out personal appearances and thus needing him less and less , Epstein built up a management agency for other big-beat talent . He bought a West End theater and produced such works as James Baldwin 's Amen Corner . He also made a none too impressive debut as host of a five-minute segment of NBC 's Hullabaloo TV series . <P> When Epstein died last week , the Beatles were some 225 miles away in Wales , getting initiated into an Indian mystic cult led by one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four Beatles rushed back to London , making statements like John 's , " We loved Brian , and he was one of us .
