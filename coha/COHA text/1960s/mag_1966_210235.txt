" There is an end to everyone 's patience , even ours , " steamed Egypt 's President Gamal Abdel Nasser . " In the past few years , the Saudis have trained Yemenis to enter Yemen and ambush Egyptians . We left Saudi Arabia alone . But today our policy is different . If aggression is carried out in Yemen , or if there is infiltration into her territory from Saudi Arabia , then we shall strike at the bases of that aggression and occupy them . " <P> Tempting Target . Thus did Nasser , in a breast-beating May Day speech , serve notice last week that the 45-month-old battle for Yemen was entering a crucial new phase . The Egyptian-Saudi truce signed last August is clearly dead . Nasser refuses to pull out of Yemen , as promised . And the Saudis refuse to stop pouring in aid , as promised . Saudi arms and supplies are flowing back again to Imam el Badr 's Royalists through the southern Saudi towns of Najran and Qizan , and from the South Arabian town of Beihan al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas by parachute , while camel caravans , moving under the cover of darkness , plod silently across the Saudi border into Yemen . On top of a previous $400 million arms deal with Britain and the U.S. , Saudi King Feisal announced fortnight ago that he is buying twelve British-built Hawker Siddeley jets , and plans a military airfield near Qizan , within ten miles of the Yemen border . <P> " We can destroy those twelve aircraft in five minutes , " Nasser scoffed in his speech last week . For his part , Nasser is launching what he calls his " long-breath strategy . " He is paring his army from 70,000 men to 40,000 , withdrawing from exposed positions in eastern and northern Yemen , and tightening his hold on the parts of Yemen that really count : the Red Sea coastline ; a northern boundary that takes in the well-fortified town of Hajja and the capital , Sana ; and the border with the South Arabian Federation , which becomes independent in 1968 and offers a tempting target for further Nasser expansion toward Aden . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other " bases of aggression , " Nasser was acting as if he meant business . " After all , " he reasoned last week , " these were originally Yemeni towns , which the Saudis usurped in 1930 . " Toward week 's end , some 5,000 Egyptian troops were massing along the border only a few miles south of Qizan . About the same time , Republican Yemen issued a formal statement , claiming Qizan and Najran as Yemen territory and pledging to " regain-by force if necessary-these usurped areas . " <P> As positions hardened on both sides , the U.S. 's Raymond A. Hare , Assistant Secretary of State for the Near East and South Asia , flew in for talks with both Feisal and Nasser . In the Saudi capital of Riyadh , Hare urged Feisal to cut off Royalist aid and give Nasser a chance to pull back without losing face . Feisal seemed willing-if he could be sure of Nasser . In Alexandria , Nasser refused , even though by doing so his country risks losing part or all of a new $150 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of industrial-development aid that Nasser badly needs .
