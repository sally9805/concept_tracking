In a hilariously solemn metaphor . Dartmouth 's college anthem boasts that the school breeds men with " the granite of New Hampshire in their muscles and their brains . " Dartmouth people darkly suspect that the world pictures their school as an Ivy League training camp for ski bums and football players , dressed in the foul-weather fashions of six-month winters and rarely troubling their granitic heads with studies . Yet these days the Hanover hills are ringing with academic reforms and resounding to the whoops of culture . <P> Just opened is the Hopkins Center for creative and performing arts , a triple-threat ( art , drama , music ) complex designed by Lincoln Center Architect Wallace Harrison , with advisers ranging from Conductor Leonard Bernstein to Choreographer Jerome Robbins . Celebrating the occasion , Dartmouth last week served a cultural feast : new music by French Composer Darius Milhaud , a show of paintings by Abstract Expressionist Hans Hofmann , the world premiere of Director John Huston 's Freud , and the first completed U.S. work of Italian Architect-Engineer Pier Luigi Nervi , which happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Small &; Lovable . What makes such a flurry the more notable is Dartmouth 's isolation-a headache since 1770 , when the Rev. Eleazar Wheelock trudged up from Connecticut with rum , drum and Bible to " civilize and Christianize ' ' the pagan redskins of New Hampshire . Some 140 miles north of Boston , where Harvard was already 134 years old , the doughty divine built a log-hut school called Dartmouth College after its English angel , the Earl of Dartmouth . Unhappily , the Indians ignored Wheelock . He was forced to import paleface students , who at first took a wry view of his brave motto . Vox Cla-mantis in Deserto ( The Voice of One Crying in the Wilderness ) . <P> The voice nonetheless got heard in 1818 , when Alumnus Daniel Webster tearfully told the equally moved U.S. Chief Justice John Marshall : - " It is , sir , as I have said , a small college , and yet there are those who love it . " In the 29 years prior to 1945 , Dartmouth won national status under President Ernest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet isolation remained a problem . When Hopkins retired , the faculty was inbred , overage , lacked the metropolitan stimulation of other famed schools . To find girls on weekends , the boys regularly killed themselves speeding down narrow roads to civilization . <P> Girls &; Books . The nearest supply of college girls is still 40 miles away at Colby Junior College . But isolation is rapidly becoming a virtue under President John Sloan Dickey , the reticent alumnus ( ' 29 ) and Boston lawyer who quit the State Department in 1945 to succeed Hopkins . For modern city kids , the Outing Club offers a 27,000-acre wilderness to romp in . Superlative Baker Memorial Library , with 800,000 volumes in stacks open for browsing , gives many a Dartmouth man his real education . Dickey parlayed the advantages : under him , endowment has more than tripled , to $73 million , book value . In six years , Dartmouth has put up $27.4 million in new construction , including the $7.5 million Hopkins Center .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
