txt Like the smile of the Mona Lisa , which he retouched with mustache and goatee , Marcel Duchamp remained an enigma . Thrust into the international limelight by the 1913 Armory Show , he abandoned his career only a decade later , at the age of 36 . Yet in half a century the enfant terrible who had thumbed his nose at the pantheon of art grew up to become the spiritual father of the pop generation ? and Marcel Duchamp the artist had blossomed into Marcel Duchamp the idea . The idea , however , posed more questions about the nature of art than it answered , for at its roots it was the idea of rejection . " I 'm afraid I 'm an agnostic in art . " Duchamp once said . " I just do n't believe in it with all the mystical trimmings . As a drug , it 's probably very useful for a number of people  --  very sedative ? but as religion it 's not even as good as- God .

His exit was final , and the perfect complement to his output as an artist . Thus his life , as well as his much shorter career , was looked upon as esthetically significant ( or insignificant , for some critics regarded the withdrawal of the Grand Dada as an escape from his own inadequacies as an artist ) . But for the most part Duchamp maintained an aristocratic detachment and reserve from such speculations , politely nodding in acquiescence to the legend that he gave up art to play chess ; or , with a thin smile crossing his sharply fea- , wed . ascetically gaunt face , describing his occupation of later years as that of " respie rateur . " He was , in the words of Lawrence Alloway , former curator of the Guggenhein Museum , " the Duke of Windsor of modern art . " And even in his abdication he commanded the esteem of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is disastrous for an artist to declare  --  to defend his art , " he said to a reporter late last year . " Posterity has to decide  --  and even if it is wrong call over the place it has the advantage of coming into being . I ? wish I could live another hundred years . " " But , " he added with a pensive smile and a moment 's pause , " perhaps it would be better to be dead . You see , I find it perfectly acceptable to contradict myself . " ? Contradiction formed an important part of the ideological and artistic universe that Ducbamp had created for himself . Finding scientific laws to be too arbitrary , he formulated his own . " Why , " he asked , " must we worship principles which in 50 or 100 years will no longer apply ? " " He responded by devising a personal logic in which cause and effect became subject to chance , and reality shifted ( through visual and verbal puns . In his universe an apple might not choose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act of love might  --  in mock deference to 20th-century science  --  exist as a fourth-dimensional ritual of machines . It was all very seriously tongue in check , yet it was also especially appealing to more than a generation of in ? tellectuals who felt that science had stripped them of traditional values and left them spiritually bankrupt . If Duchamp did not provide the cure for spirituel malaise he at least offered wit , absurdity and the humor of ' paradox as anodyne . t.Yet Duchamp 's works also pointed , to more positive concepts of art that would be articulated by generations to come : the illusionism of painting giving way to the reality of the three-dimensional object , the self-effacement of the artist , the object competing and merging with its environment .

At the center of public ridicule , heaped primarily on the cubist section of the exhibition , Duchamp 's " Nude Descending a Staircase " stood as the symbol of the insanity to which modern art had progressed . The Association of American Painters and Sculptors , organizers of the show , not only anticipated the clamor that America 's first exposure to Europe 's new , nonrepresentational painting would generate ; they also helped to create a circus atmosphere for its inspection . Press releases deluged the newspapers , which responded enthusiastically with satirical cartoons and derisive commentary . The " Nude " became an " explosion in a shingle factory " and " a collection of saddlebags . " Big crowds filed into the 69th Regiment Armory , at Lexington Avenue and 25th Street , and guards had to restrain outraged art lovers from damaging the painting . It was neither the nude nor the staircase , apparently , that had provoked them , but the title , painted onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with either  --  and the idea of a nude descending instead of traditionally reclining or standing . Time and Space ' Duchamp carefully explained the , painting : It is an organization of kinetic elements , an expression of time and space through the abstract presentation , of motion . " In trying to consider the notion of form through space , in a given time , he said it was necessary " to enter the realm of geometry and mathematics . " " Now if I ? show the ascent of an airplane , I try to show what it does , " he continued . " I do not make a still-life picture of it . When the vision of the ' Nude ' flashed upon me , I knew that it would break forever the enslaving chains of naturalism . " Half a century after the Armory Show , Duchamp recalled the indignation that had made his name a household word : " I found it very pleasant because after all my aim was not to please the general public . The scandal was exactly in my program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That also was very pleasant . " The picture , which hangs in the Arensberg collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art , is now valued at more than $250,000 . Marcel Duchamp was born in Blainville , near Rouen , on July 28 , 1887 , the third son of a family remarkable for its contribution to art of this century . His eldest brother , Gaston ( Jacques Villon ) , was to achieve international renown as a painter before his death in 1963 . Another brother , Raymond ( Duchamp-Villon ) , who was killed during World War I , had been one of the most gifted sculptors of his generation ; a younger sister , Suzanne , would also become a painter . With the blessings of his parents , Eugene Duchamp , prosperous notary , and Lucie Nicolle Duchamp , Marcel left home at the age of 17 to pursue a career in art . He arrived in Paris at the twilight of an epoch . In just a few years , Braque and Picasso were to shatter the conventions of representational art with cubism ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the avant-garde , and Dada would insist on sweeping away established values . He enrolled at the Academie Julian in 1904 and took up quarters with his brother Jacques . But the Academie soon lost its glamour . " I was already disgusted with the cuisine of painting , " he said later . " I played mostly billiards at the time . " After a year of military service the young painter returned to Paris . He had already demonstrated an easy technical grasp of Cezanne and Matisse when he began to experiment with the geometry and muted colors of cubism . Unlike his brothers , however , who were to adapt their own sensibilities to cubism , Marcel again began to alter his style . Like the futurists he employed a succession of flat overlapping planes to depict spatial movement of machinelike forms . He also supplemented his work with verbal , extravisual ideas . His famous " Nude " had in fact started as a sketch for a poem . In-1912 , after making several preliminary studies of the " Nude , " he submitted it to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The futuristic elements of the painting angered the members of the group , and at the request of his brothers he withdrew the work . Duchamp recalled : " I put the painting under my arm , got into a taxi and went home . After that groups meant very little to me . " ' Playful Physics ' In the years preceding the war , he and the artist Francis Picabia , who shared each other 's sense of iconoclastic wit and absurd humor , became close friends . Both had been familiar with earlier practitioners of the genre : Alfred Jerry , the playwright who , suffering from malnutrition , on his deathbed had asked for a toothpick , and Erik Satie , the composer who , criticized for writing shapeless music , offered a work entitled " Three Pieces in the Form of a Pear . " In this spirit , Duchamp developed a " playful physics . " Dissatisified with the meter as a fixed unit of measurement , he created his own , painstakingly scientific unit . He cut pieces of thread exactly one meter in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exactly one meter . He then varnished them in the chance positions they had assumed and had wooden rulers cut from them . Later he used the rulers to trace lines in his big unfinished work on transparent glass , " The Bridell Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors , Even . " Meanwhile he had begun to question the visual basis of art . " I wanted to get away from the physical aspects of painting , " he once explained . " I was interested in ideas ? not merely in visual products . I wanted to put painting again in the service of the mind . " In 1913 he produced the first of his " ready-mades " ? the everyday objects he elevated by mere selection to the stature of art . These parodistic gestures against what he considered the inflated importance of " retinal " art were to become the altarpieces of pop artists and junk sculptors . Tracing the development of the ready-made , Duchamp said in Hans Richter 's " Dada : Art and Anti-Art " : " In New York in 1915 I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wrote ' in advance of the broken arm . ' " It was around that time that the word ' ready-made ' came to my mind to designate this form of manifestation . " A point that I want very much to establish is that the choice of these ' ready-mades ' was never dictated by esthetic delectation . " The choice was based on a reaction of visual indifference with a total absence of good or bad taste . . . in fact a complete anesthesia . " Sometimes I would add a graphic detail of presentation which , in order to satisfy my craving for alliterations , would be called ' ready-made aided . ' " At another time , wanting to expose the basic antinomy between art and ' ready-mades ' I imagined a ' reciprocal readymade ' : Use a Rembrandt as an ironing board ! " With the outbreak of war , Duchamp , out of uniform because of a heart ailment , became a target of abuse in the midst of patriotic fervor . Never drawn by " the spectacle " of Parisian cafe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his reserve was soon to be challenged in New York . He arrived here for the first time in 1915 , a celebrity for the scandal he had created in absentia . He quickly fell into an avant-garde artistic circle and glittering social milieu . Women found wit in Duchamp 's conversation , elegance in his manner and masculinity in his gray eyes , reddish blond hair , sharply defined features and trim build . In 1917 Duchamp resigned from the Society of Independent Artists after it had reversed its policy of accepting for exhibition any work accompanied by a $6 entry fee . The object of the controversy was " Fountain , " a porcelain urinal turned upside down and signed by a Philadelphia sculptor , " R. Mutt . " " Fountain , " of course , was Duchamp 's own contribution to the exhibition . In 1919 he visited a Paris in the full bloom of Dada as a hero of the movement . After contributing his " ready-made aided " Mona Lisa for the cover of Picabia 's 391 magazine , he returned to New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemd to only enhance his prestige . By this time he had abandoned painting on canvas and had begun piecing together , little by little , " The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors , Even , " or , as it sometimes called , " The Big Glass . " He also decided to adopt a female alter ego , Rose Selavy ( a pun on c'est la vie ) , who signed such ready-mades as " Fresh Widow , " a carpenter 's model French window with black , leather-covered panes . After working on it for eight years  --  never more than a few hours at a time  --  he stopped in 1923 ' because " the whole thing no longer interested me . " That year also marked his departure from the formal practice of art . Commercialization and the acceptance of art by the middle class , he said later , had been factors in his withdrawal . In the years that followed , he devoted a good deal of his time to playing chess , a game that he had enjoyed since his youth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts a good match , who would rather risk loss by playing an unusual game than win , conventionally . ' During the nineteen-thirties and forties Duchamp 's forays into public activity were infrequent . A shadowy presence on the international art scene , he advised dealers and collectors on purchases . The rise of pop art in the early sixties stirred a renewal of interest in Duchamp 's work . However , pop art 's celebrations of the Coke bottle , the Campbell 's Soup can and other mundane objects , unlike its ' ready-made predecessors , were to be accepted as genuine artistic statements . In 1962 he wrote a letter to Hans Richter , another founder of Dada : " When I discovered readymades I thought to discourage esthetics . In Neo-Dada they have taken my readymades and found esthetic beauty in them . I threw the bottle-rack and the urinal into their faces as a challenge and now they admire tnem for their esthetic beauty . " Duchamp accepted his new acclaim , however . Museums ? the august institutions he had long ago mocked ? paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big retrospective , at the Pasadena Art Museum . Another large Duchamp survey was mounted in 1966 by the Tate Gallery in London . Duchamp , who became a United States citizen in 1955 , lived comfortably in a brownstone on 10th Street off Fifth Avenue with his wife , the former Alexina ( Teeny ) Settler , whom he married in 1954 . On the walls of their living room , paintings by Matisse , Mire and other " retinals , " as he called them , suggested that he would not have to issue a check on the " Teeth 's Loan ** Co. , Consolidated " to pay a $115 dental bill , as he did in 1919 . His dentist , in true Dada spirit , accepted the check and later sold it , back to him for more than the amount owed . In recent years Duchamp was a familiar figure on Madison Avenue , visiting galleries and keeping up a lively commentary on the state of art . He attributed his longevity to " not much liquor but all the women you want , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to inexpensive Philippine cigars . He also gave up chess . " I do n't play very much any more , " he said last year . " I have a hard time winning , even from the wood pushers as we call them . Once or twice a year I go to the Marshall Chess Club across the street , but that 's all . You can forget about something you love very much . It 's a Zen concept . When I put my ' Nude ' under my arm and went home , it was my first Zen experience . Do n't cry . "
