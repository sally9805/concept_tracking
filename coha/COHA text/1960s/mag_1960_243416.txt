Adulterers in Connecticut run a risk of five-year jail terms , but in Kentucky can incur no heavier legal penalty than a $50 fine . Nevada does not even consider adultery a crime . Because of such disparities and contradictions . Manhattan Lawyer Morris Ploscowe , expert on U.S. criminal codes and a former New York City magistrate , argues for a major overhaul of U.S. sex laws in the current Duke University law review . Says he : " American men and women are continually upon the move . They should not be exposed to the risk of being branded felons in one state for sexual behavior that may be legally innocuous in another . " Examples of state-to-state variations : <P> The age of consent , generally set at 16 to 18 years , ranges from 12 in Alabama to 21 in Tennessee . <P> Homosexual acts between consenting adults are misdemeanors in New York , but in Nevada and Michigan they are felonies punishable by life imprisonment . <P> In North Carolina , promiscuity of an underage female can be a defense against a rape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even when the woman involved is a professional prostitute . <P> Fornication is not a crime in South Dakota , Vermont or Washington , but in Arizona carries a three-year prison sentence . <P> <P> Besides these disparities among state laws , Ploscowe is bothered " by the gulf between the laws and what he thinks are the prevailing U.S. patterns of sexual behavior as shown by Kinsey-type reports . " Sex offense legislation presently on the books , " says Ploscowe , " is largely unenforceable , and much of this legislation does a great deal more harm than good . Few branches of the law have shown such a wide divergence between actual human behavior and stated legal norms . "
