He is young but not angry . He could n't care less about whether there is room at the top . He is a vague and vagrant first person singular who drifts through a colloid of far-out characters that are his ( and his plot 's ) only visible means of support . His mate is a dim , dumb , sensible girl , who pulls up his socks from time to time and does her best to dry his tears of existential anguish . <P> Authors Colin Wilson and Rayner Heppenstall are an improbable two-piano team . Wilson , 30 , is the lank young man who scored five years ago with a precocious , philosophicallow book of criticism called The Outsider , and has produced three non-scores since . Heppenstall , 50. is a respected British critic ( The Fourfold Tradition ) and novelist ( The Blaze of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But in these two books they are hammering away at the same theme . The music is not much ; the main difference is that Heppenstall can really play . <P> Bourgeois Animal . Wilson 's Adrift in Soho is about Harry , who felt like " a trapped animal " in his Midlands town . So he came to London with about 25 , a cardboard suitcase and a haversack full of books to practice his trade of being a poet and philosopher .

Heppenstall 's The Greater Infortune concerns a Scot named A. W. Leckie who goes bankrupt , settles in London with his incredibly cheerful wife Alison , and begins to subsist on handouts from a rich homosexual . He goes partying with a congeries of unlovable eccentrics , such as the frail and balding Gabriel Fantl , who was " reputed to have more women by the month than any known man , ' ' elderly Effie , who had three ghosts ( a poltergeist , Thomas De Quincey , and a half-man , half-beast ) , and Flora Massingham , " as fat and pink as a pig at Christmas , " who took him to see a magic show where a young woman was really sawed in half .
