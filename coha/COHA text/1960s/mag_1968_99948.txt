Outside the Arena in St. Louis gleams a massive orange-and-yellow neon sign . Occupying the far left section of the sign is an electronic hockey player in the uniform of the St. Louis Blues . Every night during the season the player repeatedly draws back his stick and blasts mighty shots toward a net at the far right of the sign 250 feet away . As each shot flies toward the goal , the words HOME OF THE ST . LOUIS BLUES  --  NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE appear in dazzling blue letters , and in a gaudy splash of red the puck sails unerringly into the net . // Early in the season the only thing the real , live Blues had in common with that electronic hot shot was the uniform . Not scoring was their specialty . So adept were they at missing the net that they looked like odds-on noncontenders for the Stanley Cup . // But look at the Blues today . They are right up there with the top teams in the expansion division of the NHL . Why ? One man . Scotty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last in the West and Goalie Glenn Hall was the one player not giving fans the lowercase blues , Lynn Patrick , who had been doubling as coach and general manager , put the 34-year-old Bowman behind the bench . Bowman immediately made a trade for New York 's Gordon ( Red ) Berenson and , lo , the team started winning . Since then St. Louis has been just about the hottest of the expansion teams , and the youngest coach in the NHL is already beginning to look like one of the best . // Some fanatical fans even claim the Blues ' new-style attack reminds them of the Montreal Canadiens , the way they head-man the puck and storm the net . Obviously , this is partly because they have in Bowman a man who spent 12 years in the Montreal organization as a coach and a scout and knows what perfection is. // The Canadiens were ripe for talent-raiding two years ago when the Blues owners , Sidney Salomon Jr . and his son , Sid III , skimmed a little off the top of their insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They wanted some of the Canadiens ' sharp young minds , and within days of each other Bowman and Cliff Fletcher , another Montreal scout , came to work on the west bank of the Mississippi . // " In the original agreement I was just supposed to scout this year , " says Bowman , a dark-haired bachelor . " I was n't supposed to start coaching until next year . I really did n't want to take over the team . I was n't in the mood to coach . I 'd been scouting in Europe and did n't have a feel for the players . But Lynn insisted he could n't handle both jobs , so I did n't have much choice . " // Six days after Bowman was made coach , he and Patrick sent their leading scorer , Ron Stewart , to the Rangers in exchange for Berenson , a man with a lifetime record of 16 goals in 185 NHL games . At the time it seemed to be the ho-hum trade of the season . // " The fact that Stewart was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Bowman . " We could n't score anyway . Stewart is a checker  --  a defensive forward  --  and that 's what Emile Francis of the Rangers wanted all along . But Berenson  --  now there 's an offensive player . He once scored 23 goals in 30 games for me at Hull- Ottawa . Lynn and I were just hoping that all Berenson needed was a chance . " // A big ( 6 feet , 185 pounds ) center with long arms and legs to match , Berenson started off slowly in St. Louis , mainly because he had gotten out of shape sitting on the bench in New York . Then he caught fire , and now he has become the Stan Mikita of the new league , scoring the big goals and setting up his teammates . St. Louis fans are in love with No. 7 , with reason : Berenson , along with Wayne Connelly of Minnesota 's North Stars , is one of the West 's first potential superstars. // " Just watch him , " says Hall , the All-Star goaltender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago . " Red seems to combine the skills of both Stan and Bobby . There is n't anything he ca n't do . He 's a great play-maker and his shot  --  well , the only trouble with his shot is that sometimes he shoots too hard . " // Berenson always could skate , pass and shoot ; in fact , he was considered one of the finest prospects in the Montreal chain until he made the apparent mistake of accepting a scholarship to the University of Michigan . " As far as the Canadiens were concerned , Red was going to waste four of the most critical years in his development , " says Bowman . " They did n't want him traipsing off to play hockey in the States . When he came back  --  with just about every record in his league  --  he was tabbed as just another American who would n't stand up to the beating he would get in the pro game . " // For the next five years Berenson shuttled between the Canadiens and their farm teams , playing for Bowman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was traded to New York . // " I never got started with the Rangers , " he says . " First I broke my foot . Then I broke my cheekbone . By the time I was ready to play , the team was going good and Emile was n't about to change it around for me . Last fall I asked Emile if he would trade me. " // " I remember a plane trip I made with Emile last spring , " says Bowman . " He said that someday , somewhere , Berenson was going to make somebody a helluva hockey player . He said he only wished it could be in New York . " It has happened instead in St. Louis , to the surprise of neither Bowman , Francis nor Berenson himself  --  although few others in hockey expected any such miracle . // One day in December , Bowman handed 3-by-5 cards to the players during a team meeting . Bowman asked each man to write how many points he thought the team would score during the rest of the season and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We were in fifth place with 23 points , " Bowman says . " I told them we would probably need 68 to make the playoffs . The cards came back with modest predictions . A few had us missing the playoffs altogether . But Berenson ! First he thought we 'd get 50 points  --  good enough for first place . Then  --  even though he had only one St. Louis goal at the time  --  he predicted he would score 20 goals and 30 assists in the remainder of the season . " Berenson , who has 22 goals and 26 assists for the year , has scored 19 goals and 20 assists since the day he filled out the card . // Without Berenson , says Bowman , the Blues would merely be playing out the season for experience . But without Bowman , say the experts , the team would have those blues you ca n't lose . // Bowman has the ability to handle each man as an individual , from the ultra-sensitive Hall ( " If he does n't throw up before a game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the belligerent Plager brothers , Barclay and Bob . " Scotty just seems to understand us , " says Berenson . " It 's as simple as that . " // Bowman says he understands hockey players because he played hockey himself . The truth of the matter is , he would probably be playing professionally today had not Jean Guy Talbot lost his temper 17 years ago and broken his stick over Bowman 's head during a junior game in the Montreal Forum . " I was lucky , " Bowman says with a wince . " The doctors said if the stick does n't break , I 'm dead . " Bowman never played again , while Talbot , after being suspended for three years for clubbing Bowman , went on to 12 brilliant seasons as a defense-man for the Canadiens. // It was to talk about Talbot that Lynn Patrick walked into Bowman 's office one afternoon this winter . " Scotty , " he said to his coach , " Detroit has asked waivers on Talbot . " Selected third by Minnesota in the expansion draft , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was 35 years old and sliding out of the NHL. // " He can still skate , ca n't he ? " asked Bowman. // " I think so , " replied Patrick . // " Then claim him , " said Bowman. // Jean Guy Talbot is now leading Canadienlike rushes for young Mr. Bowman , who insists : " We can always use a guy who can skate .
