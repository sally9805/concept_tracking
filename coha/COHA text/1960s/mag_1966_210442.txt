WHO ARE THE VIOLETS NOW ? by Auberon Waugh . 252 pages . Simon &; Schuster. $4.95 . <P> Auberon Waugh is the son of the late Evelyn Waugh and a facile satirist in his own right ( The Foxglove Saga , Path of Dalliance ) . The hero of Violets is an epicene idealist who ghostwrites advice columns for a woman 's magazine and comforts his faltering ego in a spare-time campaign for world peace . He also campaigns to seduce the white mistress of a Negro extremist , but before he can succeed , he meanders his motorcycle euphorically , and fatally , into the path of a passing automobile . So much , says Author Auberon , for epicene idealists . He has obviously inherited his father 's acerb satiric wit , but having nothing new to say , does not know what to do with it .
