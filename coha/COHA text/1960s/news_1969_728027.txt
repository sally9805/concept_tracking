txt There is growing evidence that Cuban Premier Fidel Castro , in an effort to shore up his nation 's economy , has come to some sort of new terms with the Soviet Union , the nation he once excoriated in sharp language . Cubanologists in the United States have for months noted this evidence , dating from the time of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia one year ago . Since that time , Dr. Castro has had only kind words to say about the Soviet Union . And there have been numerous other evidences of this new friendliness . The latest was the visit last month to Cuban waters by a Soviet Navy flotilla . Seven warships marked the first significant Soviet naval penetration into Latin-American waters . Ships and their crews were warmly welcomed by Dr. Castro , who said Cuban ports would always be open to Soviet Navy vessels . Even more important , according to students of Cuban affairs , are various diplomatic efforts between Moscow and Havana . They include reports that the Soviet Union will purchase half of Cuba 's 1970 sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a final-year goal of Cuba 's five-year program to increase sugar harvests . Debatable implication Dr. Castro 's friendliness with the Soviet Union , the visit of Soviet naval vessels , and Soviet sugar purchases together tend to confirm disclosures made last month by a Cuban intelligence officer who defected to the United States . These disclosures first appeared in The Christian Science Monitor July 16 . Defector Orlando Castro Hidalgo ( no relation to the Premier ) said that Dr. Castro had signed a secret agreement with the Soviet Union in the summer of 1968 providing for continuing Soviet economic assistance in return for Cuban support of the Soviet Union . The implication in the Castro Hidalgo testimony was that Dr. Castro 's lagging economic situation demanded the agreement . Whether that implication is correct is open to debate . Moreover , there is no firm evidence that such a Soviet-Cuban agreement does in fact exist . Mr. Castro Hidalgo 's testimony is the only statement that such an agreement exists . Nevertheless , there is plenty of circumstantial evidence to suggest that he may be correct . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , the fact is there has been a warming trend in Soviet-Cuban relations since last summer . Break had loomed Prior to that time , Dr. Castro 's increasingly independent tone led some observers to conclude that a break between the two nations was imminent . Dr. Castro expressed verbal displeasure over ' Moscow 's effort to line up trade and diplomatic relations with Latin-American nations  --  a move running counter to Cuba 's effort to foment revolution in Latin America . Dr. Castro also attacked strings tied to Soviet aid to Cuba , the alleged lack of firm support for North Vietnam and the Viet Cong on the part of the Soviet Union , and Moscow 's policy of increasing coexistence with Western nations . Previous levels pledged But this approach ended last summer . Careful reading of all Castro speeches since then has failed to turn up evidence of such a policy line , Instead , speeches have included firm praise for the Soviet Union . Reports from Havana recently suggest that whether there was actual agreement between the two nations , the Soviet Union did agree last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels and to give that island nation about $60 million yearly in military assistance . Soviet aid to Cuba in the past has been estimated at somewhere in excess of a million dollars daily ? including an important sugar subsidy paid to Cubans for sugar taken by the Soviet Union . This subsidy is similar to that paid by the United States for its sugar purchases abroad , though the United States does not include this sum in its aid programs . Cuba is hoping that its 1970 sugar production totals 10 mil ? lion tons . If the Soviet Union purchased half of it , assuming production totaled the full 10 million tons , the purchase would net the island $600 million . Cuban Government sources say they hope to sell the remainder to Communist China , East Germany , Algeria , and other nations ( the latter under terms of the International Sugar Agreement ) . Such a sale would be a bountiful benefit to the island nation 's economy and would help , it is felt , to end some of the grumbling being heard more frequently on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
