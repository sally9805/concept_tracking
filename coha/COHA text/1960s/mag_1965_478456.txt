Just do n't get too complicated , Eddie . When a guy gets complicated he 's unhappy . And when he 's unhappy ? his luck runs out .... ? Raymond Chandler , The Blue Dahlia Raymond Chandler was fifty-seven when he risked his life for me . By then most of his books had been written ? some of them twice : first , long ago , for a pittance from the pulps ; then , again , when they were combined and expanded ( " cannibalized " as he called it ) for publication as hardbacks and , later , as paperbacks . His creative days were almost over , but his great success was just beginning ; royalties were coming in now , followed by movie sales . For the first time in many years ? since he ceased to work as an executive for a Los Angeles oil company ? Chandler and his wife were able to enjoy such modest Southern Californian comforts as they desired . Ray appeared at the Paramount studio in Hollywood soon after I got there ; he came at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on dialogue and to supply the Los Angeles atmosphere for a movie called Double Indemnity , which ( as played by Edward G. Robinson , Barbara Stanwyck , and Fred MacMurray ) made a lot of money and received an Academy nomination . By then two of his books had already been made into films ( Farewell , My Lovely and The Big Sleep ) but Ray had not been invited to work on the screenplays . He grumbled about that ? as he did about a number of things that happened to him in Hollywood . Sometimes he did more than grumble . I hardly knew Ray when he issued his first ultimatum to the studio . Typed on a long sheet of yellow paper , it listed the numerous indignities which he claimed he was suffering at the hands of his collaborator and demanded their instant redress . 1 remember two of his grievances : Item ? Mr. Wilder was at no time to swish under Mr. Chandler 's nose or to point in his direction the thin , leather-handled malacca cane which Mr. Wilder was in the habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilder was not to give Mr. Chandler orders of an arbitrary or personal nature , such as " Ray , will you open that window ? " or " Ray , will you shut that door , please ? " Our Gentle Bond Apparently his demands were met , for he stayed on to finish the script . It was during this time that our friendship began , based on the surprising premise that he and I alone , of all those currently employed at Paramount , were British Public School Men ? and , consequently , Gentlemen . It lasted till his death in 1959 . It is not always easy to remember that Chandler , whose literary territory was bounded by Malibu on the west , Long Beach on the south , and San Bernardino on the east , and whose writing gave the world some of its most ruthless documentation on the seamier aspects of Southern California society in the ' twenties and ' thirties of this century , had spent most of his adolescence in England and had been educated in the classics at Dulwich . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the pressures of the glib and forceful men with whom he was working , I think he was hoping to recapture with me , for a few moments , the sounds and memories of his childhood . It was one of the basic inhibitions of that Public School system that you did not ask questions about your companion 's past ; consequently , I never got to know much about Chandler 's life . There was a story around the studio that he had earned his living for a time stringing tennis rackets ; there was also a rumor that he had , for many years , been an alcoholic . This was easy to believe , for the first impression Ray gave was one of extreme frailty ; it was not till later that you discovered the peculiar strength that lay beneath his ashy , burnt-out look and his querulous hypochondria . In life he was too inhibited to be gay ; too emotional to be witty . And the English Public School system which he loved had left its sexually devastating mark upon him . The presence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbed and excited him . His voice was normally muted ; it was in a husky whisper that he uttered those juvenile obscenities at which he would have been the first to take offense , if they had been spoken by others . Soon after he had finished Double Indemnity Ray came to work with me on what was to be my first film . Charles Brackett had just produced a successful ghost story called The Uninvited ; what more natural than that the studio should change the title of my rather banal mystery to The Unseen ? . It was felt that the script needed some added toughness ; who was more qualified to toughen a script than Ray Chandler ? At a thousand dollars a week , Ray was agreeable . The fact that neither of us was under any delusion as to the transcendent merit of the project on which we were engaged helped to make the seven or eight weeks of our association relaxed and pleasant . After the " polish job " was over we continued to see each other occasionally . We dined together several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove the monumental , gray-green , vintage Packard convertible of which he was soproud up the steep dirt road that ran around the edge of the hill between King 's and Queen 's Roads , high above Ciro 's and the Hollywood Strip . From my terrace , to the right , we could see the Pacific and Catalina ; far off to the left . still visible above the smog , the pyramidal tower of City Hall ; directly below , the long thin line of La Cienega ( before it became the Fifty-seventh Street of the West ) stretching directly ahead till it got lost among the oil wells of Baldwin Hills ? all Chandler territory . With him on these visits ? with him , in fact , wherever he went , except to the studio ? was his wife , " Cissie . " In Hollywood , where the selection of wives was frequently confused with the casting of motion pictures , Cissie was an anomaly and a phenomenon . Ray 's life had been hard ; he looked ten years older than his age . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty years younger . Later , after she had died , " not by inches but by half-inches , " Ray wrote to me of their " thirty years , ten months and four days of as happy a marriage as any man could expect . " He wrote from the loneliness of his big house overlooking the sea in La Jolla , where he and Cissie had hoped to retire . The letter ended ; Before I stop talking about myself ? I do n't really want to , but a lonely man does it too much , I know ? I do like to remember what I worked on for you . We once wrote a picture called The Blue Dahlia , remember ? It may not have been the best but at least we tried . And the circumstances were a bit difficult . ... I do remember . We did try . And the circumstances were , as Ray said , " a bit difficult . " To the Rescue of Alan Ladd It was early in 1945 , not long after Buddy da Silva 's stormy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to the horrifying realization that Alan Ladd , Paramount 's top star and principal asset ( at that time the highest-rated male performer in the U. S. ) would be reentering the Army in three months ' time , leaving behind him not one single foot of film for the company to release in his absence . At our next producers ' meeting , between the dire threats and fulsome flatteries with which our new executive producer was wont to entertain us , we were given to understand that anyone coming up with an Alan Ladd vehicle ready to go into production within a month ( a sheer impossibility ) would earn the *Mr . Chandler 's letters are quoted with the permission of Helga Green Literary Agency . undying gratitude of the studio and of Mr. Balaban , its chief stockholder . Two days later Ray Chandler , lunching with me in one of the funereal cubicles at Lucey 's , across the street from the studio , complained of being stuck on the book he was writing and muttered that he was seriously thinking of turning it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we went to his house ? a small , Spanish-style stucco bungalow west of Fairfax , where Cissie was lying in a cloud of pink tarlatan , with a broken leg ? and I read the first hundred and twenty typed pages of his book . Forty-eight hours later Paramount had bought The Blue Dahlia for a substantial sum and Ray Chandler was at work on a screenplay for Alan Ladd . I was to produce it , under the supervision of Joseph Sistrom , a lively second-generation Hollywood movie man who , with his pink cheeks and his stiff , black golliwog hair , looked like a schoolboy of fourteen . In those lush days , it usually took about a year and a half to produce an A-picture . The average writing time for an adaptation was around five months ; for an original , rather more . After that , there was a period of gestation to allow everybody to criticize and tamper with the script ; this created the need for revisions which took another three months . Then came the casting . And while we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that came later ( as the business began to fall apart ) , it often took three or four months to find the right actors for a picture . Finally , a director having been chosen and having almost certainly demanded rewrites which might take another eight to fifteen weeks , production would start . The average shooting schedule for an A-picture was between seven and twelve weeks , and the editing and scoring took another three to four months after that . Ray Chandler delivered the first half of his script ? about forty-five minutes of film ? in under three weeks , at the rate of four or five pages a day . This was no miracle ; the scenes and the dialogue were already written , with transitions which Ray carried directly into the screenplay . After the first seventy pages had been mimeographed , a shooting date was set ? three weeks away . Everyone was astounded , and busy taking credit . Our director was one of the old maestros of Hollywood ? George Marshall , who had been in movies since their earliest days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had never become one of the giants , but he held a solid and honorable position in the industry . His most famous picture was Destry Rides Again , which , according to him , he had practically created on the set . This and similar successes resulted in a state of mind ( which he shared with many of his colleagues at the time ) in which the director showed absolutely no respect for the script and made it a point of prestige , justifying his high salary , to rewrite it almost entirely as he went along . It took a lot of earnest talk from me ( though , since I was a beginner , George did n't pay much attention ) and from Joe Sistrom to convince George Marshall that The Blue Dahlia was an inspired script which he was not expected to rewrite or improvise on the set . Casting presented no serious problem . The leading part , as written by Chandler for Alan Ladd , was perfectly suited to the special qualities of that surprising star , who had played a part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kane and had continued to work as a stagehand , between jobs , until the lucky day on which he appeared in This Gun for Hire , playing a professional killer with a poignant and desolating ferocity that made him unique , for a time , among the male heroes of his day . As a star , Ladd had some say in the choice of the persons with whom he worked . Since he himself was extremely short . he had only one standard by which he judged his fellow players : their height . Meeting another actor for the first time , if his glance hit him or her anywhere below the collarbone , he was sure to explain as soon as we were alone that he did n't think he or she was exactly right for the part , and would we please find someone else . Veronica Lake was the perfect size for him , but we had trouble over the part of his dissolute wife in which , not altogether perversely , we had cast a beautiful , dark-haired girl named Doris Dowling . Since she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a determined attempt to get rid of her ; we placated him in their scenes together by keeping her sitting or lying down . Also in the east were Bill Bendix and a whole troupe of those low-life types with whom motion pictures , and now television , have always been so plentifully populated . Rumanian-born , Cambridge-educated John Houseman has produced and directed an extraordinary number of artistic and commercial successes in three decades in the American theater , movies , radio , TV , public service , and university teaching ? from " Four Saints in Three Acts " and " Men from Mars " to " Executive Suite " and " The Seven Lively Arts . " Now writing in Paris , he will return to the U.S. next year to head the new drama division of the Juilliard School of Music , 58 LOST FORTNIGHT Shooting of The Blue Dahlia went well from the start . By the end of our first week we were a day and a half ahead of schedule . In the next fortnight we gained another day . It was not until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of alarm invaded the studio when the script girl pointed out that the camera was rapidly gaining on the script . We had shot sixty-two pages in four weeks ; Mr. Chandler , during that time , had turned in only twenty-two ? with another thirty to go . Pause at Page 83 Ray 's problem with the script ( as with the book ) was a simple one : he had no ending . On page 83 of the shooting script he had reached the following impasse : Ladd 's wife ( all five foot seven of her ) had been found shot ? in a position that suggested , but clearly was not , suicide . Our hero was suspected ( by the police , but not by anyone else ) of having knocked her off in a rage on discovering the kind of life she had led during his absence in the South Pacific . Of the members of his bomber crew , with whom he had returned from the war , one was a dull and devoted friend ; the other ( Bill Bendix ) , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments of total aberration , was under very serious suspicion which he was doing everything possible to aggravate . Obviously , he was innocent . There was a villain , lover of the hero 's wife ; as the main suspect he , too , was clearly above suspicion . There was also the villain 's estranged wife ( Veronica Lake ) , who had picked up our hero , at night , on the Pacific highway ; but since she had immediately fallen in love with him and he with her ? in a nice way ? it was quite clear that the murder could n't possibly be her work . Other characters and suspects included a professional killer , a number of petty crooks , two blackmailers , an ambulance chaser , a house detective , a bartender , and a night watchman , each of whom could very plausibly , with one or two added close-ups and a few planted lines , assume responsibility for the shooting . Still , I was not worried . Ray had written such stories for years and I was quite confident that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy the suspense ) he would wind up the proceedings with an " artistic " revelation ( it was his word ) and a caustic last line . But as the days went by and the camera went on chewing its way through the script and still no ending arrived , signs of tension began to appear . Joe Sistrom , who shared my faith in Ray but who was being tortured by the production department , called a couple of meetings in his quarters on the ground floor of the main Paramount office block , with its Elizabethan timbering and casement windows , to discuss the situation and to review our various suspects . And it was during one of these meetings , early one afternoon , that a man came running down the studio street , stopping at the various windows to shout something we could not hear to the people inside . When he reached us , he shoved his head in and told us that President Roosevelt was dead . I remember that we sat stunned for a while . One by one , we said all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already , on the photographs from Yalta how reckless it had been of him to take that ride in the pouring rain through the New York streets ; how he had looked and sounded on that morning of his first inauguration almost exactly twelve years ago ? all the things that everyone was saying , in that moment , all over the world and would continue to say in the days and the years to come . Finally we fell silent and sat there gloomily for a while . Then , gradually , we drifted back to our story conference ; half an hour later , we were deep in the intricacies of The Blue Dahlia , looking for the least likely suspect and trying to decide on whom it would be most satisfying to pin the murder . We went through all the tired alternatives , using them to smother the realities of the world outside , and Ray sat listening , only half there , nodding his head , saying little . Two days later I was sitting in my office when my secretary hurried in to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was not used to this formality and there was something strange about the way she said it . When Ray came in , he was deadly pale and his hands were trembling . She made him a cup of coffee and , piece by piece , I heard his story : Late the night before , Ray 's agent had called him to say that the head of production would like to see him , privately , in his office , at nine-thirty the next morning . Ray spent a sleepless night ; he was a timorous man and his agitation was increased by the admonition that he should , under no circumstances , mention the appointment to me . When he appeared in the paneled executive office with the English hunting prints and the cream wall-to-wall carpet , Ray was told that the future of Paramount would be seriously imperiled if the balance of The Blue Dahlia script was not delivered on time . If it was ? such would be the studio 's gratitude and appreciation that a check for five thousand dollars would be exchanged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was the front-office calculation , I suppose , that by dangling this fresh carrot before Chandler 's nose they were executing a brilliant and cunning maneuver . They did not know their man . They succeeded , instead , in disturbing him in three distinct and separate ways : One , his faith in himself was destroyed . By never letting Ray share my apprehensions , I had convinced him of my confidence in his ability to finish the script on time . This sense of security was now hopelessly shattered . Two , he had been insulted . To Ray , the bonus was nothing but a bribe . To be offered a large additional sum of money for the completion of an assignment for which he had already contracted and which he had every intention of fulfilling was by his standards a degradation and a dishonor . Three , he had been invited to betray a friend and fellow Public School man . The way the interview had been conducted ( " behind your back " ) filled Ray with humiliation and rage . Waiting for Whodunit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous despair , the depth of which it took me some time to realize . But finally , when he assured me that his creative mechanism had been wrecked and that he had no choice but to withdraw from a project to which he had nothing more to contribute , I found myself believing him . After he had gone ? to lie down and , later , to discuss the matter with Cissie ? I tried to evaluate my situation . The latest word from the sound stage was that we would complete page 93 before night . That left us with seven pages of unshot script plus two short scenes which we had delayed making till we knew who had done the killing . In all , less than three days ' work . And in ten days ' time Alan Ladd would vanish beyond hope of recovery into the U. S. Army ? forever . The front office called in the afternoon over the executive intercom and I ignored the call . Joe Sistrom came around and I told him what had happened . While he was with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the circumstances , almost seemed like good news . During a scene of mayhem , one of our heavies had let a massive oak tabletop fall upon and break another heavy 's toe . But when we reached the set , George Marshall told us not to worry ; he had found a way for the Injured heavy to play the rest of his scene from the floor . He also asked where the rest of the pages were . The next morning , true to his promise , Chandler appeared in my office , looking less distraught but grimmer than the day before . He said that after a sleepless and tormented night he had come to the unalterable conclusion that he was incapable of finishing The Blue Dahlia script on time ? or ever . This declaration was followed by a silence of several minutes during which we gazed at each other , more in sorrow than in anger . Then , having finished his coffee and carefully put down his cup on the floor , Ray spoke again , softly and seriously . After some prefatory remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he held me , he made the following astonishing proposal : I was certainly aware ( or had heard it rumored ) that he had for some years been a serious drinker ? to the point where he had gravely endangered his health . By an intense effort of will he had managed to overcome his addiction . This abstinence , he explained , had been all the more difficult to sustain , since alcohol gave him an energy and a self-assurance that he could achieve in no other way . This brought us to the crux of the matter ; having repeated that he was unable and unwilling to continue working on The Blue Dahlia at the studio , sober , Ray assured me of his complete confidence in his ability to finish it , at home ? drunk . He did not minimize the hazards : he pointed out that his plan , if adopted , would call for deep faith on my part and supreme courage on his , since he would in effect be completing the script at the risk of his life . ( It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since he had a doctor who gave him such massive injections of glucose that he could last for weeks with no solid food at all . It was the sobering up that was parlous ; the terrible strain of his return to normal living . ) That was why Cissie had so long and so bitterly opposed his proposed scheme , till Ray had finally convinced her that honor came before safety , and that his honor was deeply engaged , through me , in The Blue Dahlia . My first reaction was one of pure panic . Such is my own insecurity that contact with a human brain that is even slightly out of control frightens , repels , and finally enrages me . On that ground alone I was horrified by Ray 's proposal . I also knew that if I was mad enough to take this risk , it would have to be entirely on my own responsibility and without the studio 's knowledge . At this point Ray produced a sheet of yellow foolscap paper ( of the same format as that on which he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the list of his basic logistical requirements : I took the paper from him and asked him for an hour to think it over . With great courtesy and understanding , Ray agreed . For half an hour I walked the studio streets . I visited the set where George informed me , not without satisfaction , that he 'd be out of script by evening of the following day . I went to Sistrom 's office by the back way . I showed him Ray 's demands and told him I had decided to take the risk . Joe approved . He said if the picture closed down we 'd all be fired anyway . He would give the front office some virus story and immediately requisition the limousines and the secretaries on different charge numbers . I thanked him and went back down the hall to my office where Ray was sitting , reading Variety . With all the Public School fervor and esprit de corps that I could dredge up from the dim memory of my ten years at Clifton , I accepted his proposal . Ray now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he suggested , as proof of my faith in him and of my confidence in the efficacy of our scheme , that we drive to the most expensive restaurant in Los Angeles and tie one on together immediately . We left the studio in Ray 's open Packard and drove to Perino 's where I watched him down three double martinis before eating a large and carefully selected lunch , followed by three double stingers . I then drove the Packard , with Ray in it , back to his house , where the two Cadillacs were already in position and the first relay of secretaries at their posts . Early next morning the limousines were still there , shining in the sun . The drivers had been changed ; so had the secretaries . Ray lay , passedout , on the sofa of his living room . On the table beside him was a tall , half-filled highball glass of bourbon ; beside it were three typed pages of script , neatly corrected ? Ray 's work of the night . As one of the black limousines rushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have guessed long ago : that the murderer of Doris Dowling was the house detective . Ray had given him a death scene : * * * I was on the sound stage when a boy on a bicycle arrived with the pages , still damp from the mimeograph machines . George Marshall read them and found them acceptable , except for one scene where Ray had the heavy with the broken toe ( which he had n't heard about ) still on his feet ; but that was easily fixed . 1 think George had looked forward to saving the day by improvising the last week 's work on the set , and that he was disappointed and perhaps a little hurt that we preferred the work of a man in an advanced stage of alcoholism to his own , but he behaved admirably . So did everyone else . The film was finished with six days to spare and Alan Ladd went off to the Army and Paramount made a lot of money . During those last eight days of shooting Chandler did not draw one sober breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips . He was polite and cheerful when I appeared and his doctor came twice a day to give him intravenous injections . The rest of the time , except when he was asleep , with his black cat by his side , Ray was never without a glass in his hand . He did not drink much . Having reached the euphoria that he needed , he continued to consume just enough bourbon and water to maintain him in that condition . He worked about a third of the time . Between eight and ten every evening , he sat in Cissie 's room and they listened together to the Gas Company 's program of classical music on the radio . The rest of the time was spent in a light sleep from which he woke in full possession of his faculties and picked up exactly where he had stopped with whichever of the rotating secretaries happened to be with him . He continued until he felt himself growing drowsy again , then dropped back comfortably into sleep while the girl went into the next room , typed the pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reread and corrected when he woke up . As his last line of the script , Ray wrote in pencil : " Did somebody say something about a drink of bourbon ? " ? and that 's how we shot it . Ray had not exaggerated when he said he was risking his life for The Blue Dahlia . His long starvation seriously weakened him and it took him almost a month to recover , during which his doctor came twice a day to administer mysterious and reviving shots which cost him a lot more than the " bonus " lie was to receive . During his convalescence he lay neatly dressed in fresh pajamas under a silk robe ; when I came to see him he would extend a white and trembling hand , and acknowledge my gratitude with the modest smile of a gravely wounded hero who had shown courage far beyond the call of duty . What It Takes to Survive In the years that followed we talked and wrote a lot about doing another movie or a television show together . It never happened . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short period in which Ray pretended to be angry with me . I had written disparagingly , in Vogue 's annual " American " issue , of the current Bogartian hero and bracketed him with Chandler 's Philip Marlowe whom ( paraphrasing Ray 's own words ) I described as a drab , melancholy man of limited intelligence and mediocre aspiration , who is satisfied to work for ten bucks a day and who , between drinks , gets beaten up regularly and laid occasionally . Ray wrote me a sharp letter in which he said that my piece was typical of the glib thinking and crummy values that made him detest Hollywood producers and all their works . In his opinion , Marlowe and his kind were the last honest men left in our society ; they did their assigned jobs and took their wages ; they were not acquisitive nor did they rise in the world by stepping on other people 's faces ; they would never try to take over the earth nor would they compensate for their own weakness by pushing other people around . Marlowe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-respecting , decent man could maintain in today 's rapacious and brutal world . I did not see much of Ray after he went to live in La Jolla . And it was only in the last two years of his life , after Cissie was dead and Ray was traveling between La Jolla and London , that we once again began to exchange letters . It was in one of these that he wrote on a subject which , till then , I had always found him reluctant to discuss ? his life as a writer : What should a man do with whatever talent God happened in an absent moment to give him ? Should he be tough and make a lot of money like me ? Of course , you do n't get it just by being tough . You lay your neck on the block in every negotiation . And for some reason unknown to me I still have my head . A writer has nothing to trade with but his life . And that 's pretty hard when other people depend on you . So how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could write a best-seller , but I never have . There was always something I could n't leave out or something I had to put in . I do n't know why . . . I am not a dedicated writer . I am only dedicated as a person . . . . Most writers are frustrated bastards with unhappy domestic lives . I was happy for too long a time , perhaps . I never really thought of what I wrote as anything more than a fire for Cissie to warm her hands at . She did n't even much like what I wrote . She never understood , and most people do n't , that to get money you have to master the world you live in , to a certain extent , and not be too frail to accept its standards . And , also , they never understood that you go through hell to get money and then you use it mostly for other people who ca n't take the punishment but nevertheless have needs . At the end , as a sort of postscript , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of myself as important and never could . The word itself is even a bit distasteful . I have had a lot of fun with the American language ; it has fascinating idioms , is constantly creative , very much like the English of Shakespeare 's time , its slang and argot is wonderful , and so on . But I have lost . Los Angeles . It is no longer the place I knew so well and was almost the first to put on paper . I have that feeling , not very unusual , that I helped create the town and was then pushed out of it by the operators . I can hardly find my way around any longer . . .
