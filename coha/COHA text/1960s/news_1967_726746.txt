txt President Johnson is not repeating at the peak of the Vietnam war the mistakes , or failures , of his predecessor , Harry S. Truman , at the peak of the Korean war . In circumstances much like those of today , President Truman flew to Wake Island to consult with his great battle leader , Gen. Douglas MacArthur . It was an act of re spect , and even humility . The President did not want to take the general away any farther than necessary from the scene of operations . The result was unfortunate . The general did not gain out of the Wake Island meeting sympathy for the President or for his problems on the home front . He returned to his command post and shortly began a series of appeals to the public over the head of the President . Mr. Truman tolerated it as long as he could and finally was forced to recall the general . The President 's only alternative at that time would have been to hand over to the general the great decisions of policy and strategy which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American political system is to function properly . The public was deeply troubled . Confidence in the President declined . At the time President Truman dismissed General MacArthur , Lyndon B. Johnson was a rapidly rising party leader in the Senate . He was one of those Democrats called to the White House for consultation . He knew intimately the whole Truman vs . MacArthur story . He shared in the damage it did to his party . We are now probably at or near the peak of the Vietnam war . This is the season when policy and strategy decisions must be made // *How LW handles generals // for the next year of war . It is a time when A president would like to have a full and - frank exchange with his top battle captain . , President Johnson is doing just that . But ' everything about the meeting between the Y'resident and Gen. William C. Westmoreland is as different as can be from the Truman-MacArthur meeting on Wake Island . At Wake Island it was almost like two heads of sovereign states meeting at a neutral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian Czar and French Emperor meeting on the raft , floating in midstream , at Tilsit , came to the mind of some present at the time . Friends of family ' This time General Westmoreland was invited to Washington . He , his wife , and daugh ; ter were " put up " at the White House . They were treated as " friends of the family . " There were several private chats . There was no. overtone of a " state occasion . " There was no hint of a negotiation between saver  --  eign and equal men . Indeed , the great decisions of policy and ' strategy for the next year of war were . , studied , and taken , before General Westmoreland and Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker left Saigon for Washington . The President had called in his theater leaders not to ' . consult on high policy but to listen to their reports and to inform them of their tasks . And , of course , if in the meantime the gen.eral 's presence happened to help the Presi'dent face down his critics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The main item of business in the Johnson-Westmoreland talks was to convey to the general a full appreciation of why he can not have substantially more troops than he has now , or is in the process of getting . The build-up is not yet entirely finished . United States troop strength in Vietnam will reach about 525,000 sometime during 1968 . This will not be enough to permit United States forces going over to the stra tegic offensive . But is is all that can be managed without calling up reserves and going over to national mobilization . These steps will not be taken , under existing plans . Retraining emphasis The general 's assignment for 1968 , therefore , is to continue to hold , consolidate , and strengthen his bases , inflict what damage he can on the enemy , and put special emphasis on retraining the South Vietnamese forces toward the point where they will begin to become effective . It is hoped that this process will permit the withdrawal of some United States units beginning in 1969 . About 15 battalions of the Army of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully combat effective . More should reach this level during 1968 , and thus increase General Westmoreland 's available forces . It is hoped that as more South Vietnamese units come into line he will be able to gain the strategic initiative , though this may not be possible before 1969 . At present , enemy strategy still dominates the battle . Beginning last March , enough pressure was brought to bear on the United States marines in the north to require reinforcements . These were withdrawn from the center . Enough pressure has been kept up ever since against the marines and their helpers , now called the Americal Division , to prevent any reduction of units there for use elsewhere . Bomb pause disputed Now fresh pressure is being applied in II Corps area in the center , from which the reinforcements for the marines were taken . And all United States forces in the remaining areas are being kept fully occupied . There will not be sufficient strength to take the offensive in the Delta unless or until substantial segments of the South Vietnam Army are fully retrained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general and the ambassador arrived from Saigon . That was over the question of another pause in the bombing of North Vietnam . That is , apparently , still under consideration . But the inclination seems to be going against such a pause . ' Main argument against it is that there is still no hard news pointing toward a likely response from Hanoi . Meanwhile , the President appears to have got the better of his critics . They gained on him during summer . and early fall . A publicity counterattack was mounted by the White House in mid-October . By now it seems to have more or less won out . Many a critic is still unhappy about the war . But no clear way out has yet appeared .
