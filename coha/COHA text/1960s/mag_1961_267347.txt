With diffident grace , as " an Oxford man with an uncertain academic record . " Alexander Frederick Douglas-Home. 57 , the 14th Earl of Home ( pronounced Hume ) , last week accepted an honorary doctorate from Harvard University . " Amid winds of change , he labors with sure lucidity for community among nations . " said the citation . In a Harvard speech , in another in Chicago , in private talks with Secretary of State Dean Rusk in Washington , Lord Home was getting across to Americans what the British have already learned to their considerable surprise : in less than a year on the job . Home has emerged as the strongest British Foreign Secretary in years , a man who seems more realistic about the Communist menace than his boss and old friend , Harold Macmillan . <P> Crisis Coming . Why is a Berlin crisis coming , Home asked the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations rhetorically last week . " It is in Germany that the Communists are seen to be losing in fair competition with a free society . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany , voting with their feet . So , apparently , the peace of the world is going to be endangered because this puppet regime can not survive unless the Iron Curtain is clamped down still more vigorously . " <P> A main purpose of Home 's trip was to lay to rest fears that Britain might welsh on its Berlin commitments . " Our signature is on the treaties , " he said . " They must be interpreted with intelligence , but we shall never falter or default on them . Some of the columnists seem to think that unless we go around whistling military tunes to keep our courage up that there is disunity among us . " <P> Such ringing conviction was the last thing his critics expected when Home took office last year . In fact , some were unkind enough to hold that his life had peaked 39 years before at Eton , where Classmate Cyril Connolly remembers him as " the graceful , tolerant , sleepy boy who is showered with favors and crowned with laurels , without any apparent exertion on his part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " At Christ Church College , Oxford , Home could not earn his blue at cricket , never matching his brilliant 66 on a sticky wicket for Eton against Harrow . He caught Neville Chamberlain 's eye and became his parliamentary private secretary-only to suffer obloquy later for having ridden with Chamberlain through the cheering crowds at Munich . In the 1945 Labor landslide , he even managed to lose his family 's " safe " Parliament seat in Lanarkshire . In 1951 , he went off to the musty House of Lords after acceding to his father 's title and his share of the family 's 100,000 acres in Scotland .
