such charges are usually allowed to lapse , for even if the result in a particular state should he changed , the winner would rarely lose his electoral majority . But if the popular vote alone were decisive , and the election close , there would he every incentive to demand investigations and recounts , and these would inevitably precipitate counter-demands , while the country waited to sec who its leaders would be . In addition , a direct popular vote would powerfully tempt the states to compete in lowering voting ages , liberalizing registration requirements , and so on , in order to increase their relative influence on the election . Another , and perhaps more serious , objection to iibolishing the electoral college is the threat to the stability of the two-party system , which has been a key element in the endurance of American democracy . Most third-party efforts either have never got off the ground or have proved transient , because , as Professor Alexander Bickel , of Yale , has noted , they have been unable to win electoral votes unless they operated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Strom Thurmond and Henry - Wallace received approximately the same popular vote , but Thurmond got thirty-nine electoral votes and Wallace none . Individuals with a common interest or conviction are restrained from forming an independent party by the knowledge that they can not carry any states and therefore will not receive any electoral votes , while their activities will tend to subtract votes from the major-party candidate who is ideologically closest to them . With only the popular vote at issue , however , regional roots are irrelevant , and groups united by belief or need  --  from blacks and those opposed to the war in Vietnam to the John Birch Society --  - might fragment the electorate into new parties in search of maximum political power . They could , as the Liberal Party has done in New York , bargain with one of the major parties for concessions in return for its endorsement , or offer to withdraw in the midst of a campaign in return for concessions . Such a party might also run candidates in the hope of forcing a runoff election in which its support would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least forty per cent of the popular vote for election , with a runoff between the two top candidates if no one gets that much . And although only Harrison received a popular minority and an electoral majority , fifteen Presidents have been elected with less than a majority of the total popular vote . Therefore , almost half of our elections have been contests in which , theoreti-cally , a third party could have held the balance of power . In two of our three last Presidential elections , the popular margin was less than a half-million votes , and in America it is possible ? with money and energy  --  to organize a half-million people for almost anything . Still another objection centers on the impact that eliminating the electoral college would have on the relative im-portance of large and small states . Both the advocates and the opponents of re-form have assumed that direct popular vote would reduce the emphasis on the large states with the most electoral votes . Yet reform might well have the opposite effect . Usually , campaigns are directed at a swing vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the assumption that the rest of the vot-ers arc pretty firmly committed . Under the reformed system , any candidate in search of those votes would have to concentrate his energies and his strategy on the large states , for that is where the people are , and also where the most vol-atile vote can he found . For example , Richard Nixon , Southern strategy and all , received about the same number of popular votes in California alone that he received in all nine states of the once solid South ( roughly three and a half million ) . Even though Nixon ran well ahead of Vice-President Humphrey in the South , a change of little more than two per cent of his vote in favor of Humphrey in the four largest states , or a change of less than one and a half per cent in the seven largest , would have cancelled out his entire Southern margin . In fact , about half the popular vote for the two major candidates came from only seven states . No political strategist , therefore , could wisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big states in the hope of picking up a few more Southern or border states . ( In fact , exactly this kind of risk-taking helped defeat Nixon in 1960. ) ft is just as likely- , and far more economical in terms of energy and expense , that under the new sys-tem a candidate would assume a basic minimum of Southern and border votes and shape his campaign to the demands of large-state politics . Why should a Presidential hopeful take positions cal-culated to win Southern states if those same positions might lose him the two or three per cent of the vote in Cali-fornia , New York , Illinois , and Penn-sylvania that would he enough to can-cel out all his gains ? All this , of course , reflects only the psychology of cam-paigns , since in fact the electoral vote has followed the popular vote . Yet once political strategists stopped thinking in terms of states and the intricate arithmetic of the electoral college , they would tend to focus on areas where the population is concentrated and on the large television " market areas . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received forty-seven electoral votes and helped keep twenty-eight more from Humphrey , while California gave him only forty electoral votes . Thus , the Southerner who voted for Nixon actually had more influence on the electoral majority than did the Californian who went Republican . ) None of these are certain consequences of change . Yet they are all possibilities , as are other results , which we can not now foresee . ( Our history is strewn with discarded democratic reforms , such as the initiative and the referendum , that frequently defeated expectations and sometimes became the instruments of those special interests they were designed to protect the country from. ) in return , we will he guarded against the possibility that the popular loser will be the electoral winner . Not . only is this highly unlikely ( in most close elections the electoral-vote majority has far exceeded the popular margin , thus strengthening the position of a President-elect ) but even if it should happen it would be in a contest so close that one would he hard put to it to claim that a firm or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sources of our national stability has been our unwillingness to change the Constitution except when abuses or malfunctions have already manifested themselves . It has never been amended simply because we feared that something might go wrong at some future date . Yet that is what is now being proposed . We will find , however , no system of choosing leaders that is guaranteed to work perfectly . Certainly a great deal of skepticism and prudent hesitation should attend any effort to " perfect " a system that has worked as well as ours . A Wonderful Time WE were on an escalator last Wed n esday afternoon , riding from the fourth floor of Stern 's department store to the fifth floor , when a bright-eyed lady in a long fur coat turned to us and said , " Do n't you think I look like a mature woman who 's trying to reenter the business world ? The sign on the main floor said there was going to be a symposium here today for the mature woman who wants to reenter the business world . Actually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you reenter something if you 've never been in it ? " As we stepped off the escalator right behind her , trying to remember what we were there for , she handed us an orange-paper package . " Here , will you please hold this for a minute ? It 's a Bloozningdale 's hag . I do n't know whether I should he seen with it here . Maybe that man over there can tell me where the symposium is . " Crying " Hey , sir , " she sprang toward a small salesman , who ducked gracefully behind a television console . Undaunted , she tracked down a larger salesman and obtained directions to the Special Events Center , on the sixth floor . Though ordinarily we are not easily distracted from our purpose ( whatever it was ) , we Followed the lady across the floor and up a flight of stairs that led to the Credit Department . " Oh , my God ! " she exclaimed . " Why do I always end up here ? " She raced past the row of credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , too . Each symposiast was being handed an envelope tilled with pamphlets and press releases concerning the topic to he discussed  --  like " Do 's and Don'ts for Mature Job Seekers " ( " Do hold yourself erect " and " Do n't keep stressing your need for a job " ) ? and program of the afternoon 's events . Marching through a crowd of three or four men and hundreds of women , most of whom appeared to he in their forties or fifties , our companion led us to the first two rows of chairs , which were decked with " Reserved " signs . She removed two of the signs and her coat , sat down , and beckoned to us to join her . We sat down . She reached into the envelope and pulled out a thin paperback hook called " Women ! Business Needs You ! A Back-to-Business Guide for Modern Women , " by Sahatino A. Russo , Jr. , with William Laas . " Can you tell how old I am ? " she asked . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell . " By the way , my name is Janet , " she said . " Business needs me . " The stage , which was a few feet in front of the chairs we were occu- ? ? pying , was furnished with a wooden lectern , a table set for three panelists , and several colorful freestanding doors , labelled with the names of fictional business concerns . According to the program , the symposium was the third annual " Business Needs You " gathering , and was sponsored by Stern Brothers and the American Girl Division of AGS Services Corporation , a temporary-office-work agency , whose president , Sahatino A. Russo , Jr. , was listed as moderator of the symposium . Janet scanned the program and remarked that the only speaker she really wanted to hear was Dr. Rose Franzhlau , the well-known psychologist , who was scheduled to he the final speaker and offer advice on " How to Weather the Emotional Crisis of Returning to Work . " " I think she knows my Aunt Clara , " Janet said , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As a matter of fact , I have been in the business world . I worked at Blooming-dale 's for a week before Christmas . I made ten dollars a day and spent thirty . See this ? " We looked , and she pointed to the heading of Chapter 4 in Mr. Russo 's book : " The One Crucial Skill  --  Typing . " " I ca n't type , " she said , growing glum . " But I once took dictation from Orson Welles . " Just at that moment , Miss Mildred Collins appeared on the stage . She is a vice-president of Stern Brothers and a rare exception , we later learned , to the general absence of women from executive positions in business . Miss Collins welcomed the audience , addressing them as " ladies like you , " by which she meant , we figured out , ladies over forty who had been without jobs for the last ten or twenty years , and who were now interested in finding jobs but fearful of being turned away for being too old or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Collins and then hack at the hook in her lap . " ' Ask yourself these questions , ' " Janet murmured . " ' What is my education ? How is my health ? Physical needs ? ' Nobody 's ever asked me that before , ' What are my present interests ? ' My present interests arc my physical needs . ' Favor28 FEN-WARY 8 , 199 ite recreation ? ' I think that taking a bath is my favorite recreation . " Meanwhile , Miss Collinswas introducing Mr. Russo ; " A young man . He is married , unfortunately Bril-liant ... Dynamic leadership ... " Janet continued reading . " ' What arc my natural aptitudes ? ' Do you have a pencil " We handed her a pencil , and she used it to check " Car driving , " " Dancing , " " Handling people , " and " Travel . " Mr. Russo , a fine-looking young man and a dynamic moderator , introduced Miss Dorothy .

Mr. Russo then returned to the lectern to explain the difference between permanent work , part-time work , temporary work , and home work . Before comparing the business world to an oyster , he advised the ladies to brush up their skills , and warned them not to forget to find out whether their husbands or teen-age children might have objections to their plans to reenter the business world . " Nobody objects to my working except me , " muttered Janet . She nudged us and pointed to the book again  --  to a questionnaire designed to indicate whether temporary work would be the most suitable form of employment for a particular mature job seeker . " Does your husband travel a great deal , leaving you alone for extended periods of time ? " one question went . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended period of time ? " she asked Us . While Mrs. Kathryn Kozlowski , from Personnel Services of the Allied Chemical Corporation , was saying that " realism is a mandatory characteristic of the mature woman , " Janet was making a perfect score on a sample vocabulary quiz .

It ... room at the top , even if you start at the bottom , " said Mrs. Kozlowski . " I want to start at the top , " Janet said . Mrs. Evelyn Cunningham , Director of the Women 's Unit of the Office of the Governor , urged the members of the audience to consider the expense of going hack to work  --  the cost of lunches , subway fares , taxes , proper garments , and visits to the beauty parlor . This , Janet told us , reminded her of her week at Bloomingdale 's . Mrs. Mary D. Keyserling , a mature woman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ? Vomen 's Bureau of the United States Department of Labor , owing to the change of Administrations , was presented with the first annual Woman Behind the Woman Award , for encouraging large numbers of her fellow-women to return to work . Mrs. Lyndon Johnson was quoted more than once as having said , " This is a wonderful time to he a woman . " Janet reached into her coat pocket and pulled out a crumpled scrap torn from the help-wanted page of the Times . She stood up abruptly . " I 've got to go brush up my skills , " she said . In spite of the prospect of hearing Dr. Franzhlau , she grabbed her coat and her package and ran . Later in the week , when we read in the Times that the Forty-second Street branch of Stern 's would be closed down forever before summer , we were still trying to remember what we went there to buy the day we met Janet . From Off Off to Off -D AMES AT SEA , " the season 's newest musical hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a capacity audience of a hundred and eighty-three at each performance . A takeoff on movie musicals of the nineteen-thirties , the show has two acts , sixteen songs , three musicians , and a cast of six . It has two producers , thirty-four investors , one director-chorcographer , one set designer , one stage manager , eight stagehands , four hoxoffice workers , five press agents , and three writers . It took the writers nine years to get the show written , produced , and , as it happened , acclaimed . The writers are three men in their forties  --  Jim Wise ( music ) ) and George Haimsohn and Robin Miller ( hook and lyrics ) . We met them in a body the other day at the Algonquin , hunched around one of those low , round , small wooden cocktail tables in the lobby , and we asked each , in turn , where he was horn , and what he was doing before he committed himself to " Dames at Sea . " Wise , a thin , gray-haired man with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Akron , Ohio , spent five years in the Army during the Second World War , reaching the rank of captain , and has been a teacher of modern drama at Newark College of Engineering for the past dozen years and , for longer than that , an instructor for a course in English at the Bernard M. Baruch College of the City University of New York . Haimsohn is tall , almost portly , with curly , untrimmed sideburns , and he was born in St. Louis , grew up in Los Angeles , majored in English at the University of California at Los Angeles , Caine to New York in 1950 to write , and did write poetry , short stories , and books entitled " The Portable Hamlet , " " The Bedside Faust , " " Inside Romeo and Juliet , " and " Carmen Confidential , " the first two of which have been published . Miller , the tallest ( six feet two and a half inches ) member of the trio , has neatly trimmed sideburns and a resemblance to Rex Harrison , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew up in an oil-lamp-lit house near Woodbridge , Suffolk , England . His parents collected records of hit tunes from American musicals . He came to New York in 1952 , when he was twenty-four , to he a writer but instead got a job in the mailroom of Foote , Cone &; Belding , the advertising agency , and worked his way up to the position of copywriter . " Why did you want to be in New York ? " we asked each of the writers . " I came to New York , in 1947 , because I wanted to write music for Broadway shows , " Wise said . " Everything comes from New York , " Haimsohn said . " A poet in Los Angeles does n't mean very much . " " New York was where everything was happening , " said Miller . " I had no connection with the theatre except that my great-uncle Roger Quilter was a composer . He wrote two operas , and some lovely music for a heavily patriotic play for children called ' Where the Rainbow Ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five . I went backstage , and I knew then that this was the most exciting thing ever , and that it was what I wanted to do . " " And ? " we asked . " After Foote , I went to another agency , which promptly lost its biggest account and folded . I was twenty-seven , and I knew it was now or never , " Miller replied . " I worked at all the usual odd jobs just to have enough money to live on , so that I could he free to write . I clerked at Doubleday at night . I even worked in a drugstore . In 1960 , I went to see ? 14.1ary Sunshine , ' the spoof of had old operettas . You know the way writers arc when they see a play . They 're on two levels  --  the enjoyment level and the thought level . About halfway through that show , I thought : I 'd like to write a spoof , too . I had the nucleus of an idea for a spoof of the movies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea to everybody . Everybody at bars , everybody at parties , everybody I saw . Finally , I talked to a literary agent I knew named John Schaffner . And that " ? Miller opened a hand in the direction of Wise ? " is where Jim came in. " " 1 had known Mrs. Schaffner during the war , " Wise said . " She was in the O.S.S. , and I was in Army Public Relations , as a press censor . I had minored in music at college , and I played the piano , just for fun , in the bar of the Hotel Chatham in Paris , where all the press correspondents hung out . After a day of working at censorship , I really enjoyed playing the piano in the Hotel Chatham 's bar . Anyway , it was the Schaffners who introduced me to Robin , because he needed a composer . " " And ? " we asked , looking at Haimsohn , " Jim and I had met in the early fifties , shortly after I came to New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write lyrics for his songs , and we found that we could work well together doing special material for night-club performers . People like Pat Carroll , Gloria De Haven , Dody Goodman , and Bibi Osterwald . " " What special material , for example ? " we asked . Wise answered . " Well , for Pat Carroll , around 1954 , we did a special- ? material song called ' My Best Girl Friend 's Very Best Boy Friend 's My Best Boy Friend Now , ' " he said . " In those days , Pat Carroll was sort of the girl-next-door type , and that was a good song for her . " " Jim and I had had the same idea as Robin , " Haimsohn said . " We were going to do something on the ' Gold Diggers ' movies , and when Robin met Jim , Robin said he felt he needed an American to work with . That 's how the three of us came together . " " 1 . Ve found that we all had a passion for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us , as kids , had lived in our local movie theatre on Saturday afternoons , " Wise said . " Mine was the Liberty in Akron . It cost ten cents . " " The Woodbridge Cinema . One shilling , " Miller said . " The Golden Gate , " Haimsohn said . " It cost a quarter . One night , we got in the family car and hit a triple feature ? Top Hat , ' A Night at the Opera , ' and a preview . " " We all got headaches watching those marvellous musicals , " Wise said . " There was one where a whole chorus disappears into a huge coffeepot . " " And in ' Kid Millions , ' with Eddie Cantor , there 's this giant chocolate milkshake that everybody comes out of , " Haimsohn said . " Deanna Durbin was my pinup , " Miller said . " And I identified madly with Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland . " " All the films on the late , late shows , " Vise said . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it 's all about  --  because they see those movies on television . " We rapped a little on the wooden cocktail table . " Well , what happened when you started working together ? " we asked . " It took us five weeks to do , " Wise said . " It went fast . " " Then what ? " we asked . " We were very naive , " Miller replied . ' We tape-recorded it , and I dragged a huge tape recorder around town , trying to get people interested in it . I remember playing it for Herb Jacriby , at the Blue Angel , one hot afternoon . He said what everybody said : Nobody knows about the thirties . ' " " We tried and tried , and then we gave up , " Wise said . " Robin went hack to England and was working there . Then George met some friends who knew Joe Cinn , of the Caffe Cino . " " A very interesting man , " said Haimsohn . " A marvellous man , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showcase for writers . He was very dedicated to this . " " What happened to the Caffe Cino ? " we asked . " Joe Cino died , " Wise said . " But not before we put on a one-act version of ' Dames at Sea ' there for thirteen weeks , in dic summer of 1966 . We were the biggest hit of Off Off Broadway ever . I was there all summer at the piano . I had a contract to teach summer school , which I had to give up . I do n't know if you remember the summer of 1966 . Heat ? " " And not once did Jim take off his coat , " Haimsohn said . " Did you get paid ? " we asked . " Yes , " Wise said . " They would pass the hat . One week , there was eight dollars and seventy-nine cents for everybody . Fourteen people , including us and our two leads , who , by the way , are still in the show Bernadette Peters and David Christmas . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stewart face and manner . Hc 's wonderful , too . " " What happened after the summer of 1966 ? " we asked . " It 's a complicated story , " Wise said . " You tell it , Jim , " said Haimsohn and Miller . " Well , someone told us we ought to have a lawyer , " Wise said . " So I called up a man named Jordan Hott , who was getting out the Off Broadway Playbill , called The Show Card . I 'd never met Hott , but I asked him for the name of a lawyer and he named a lawyer for me . A year later , our theatre at Newark College of Engineering needed a teacher-director , and I called up Hott for a recommendation again . We talked about it over a cup of coffee , and a few days later he called me up and said that he was interested in taking the job himself . Everybody at Newark liked him , and he started working there . And at one point he asked to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to him , and he said he wanted to take an option to produce it . " " I came back from London last October , and we did some cutting and rewriting , " Miller said . " We had already expanded the script to two acts while playing the one-act version at the Cino . " " How much did it cost to produce ? " we asked . " It was budgeted at thirty thousand dollars , but it cost six or seven thousand more , " ' Wise said . " Most of our investors are lawyers and doctors , " Haimsohn said . " Three are teachers from Newark College of Engineering , " Wise added . " Shares were sold at six hundred dollars apiece , but we could n't afford to buy any , " Miller said . " Except for me . I bought one , fifty-fifty , with a friend , " Wise said . " Two Christmases ago , I was driving a taxi in London , " Miller said thoughtfully . " Well , how are you all doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard six-per-cent royalty , " ' Wise said . " I 'm staying with friends , " Miller said . " I ca n't afford a hotel . " " We 've paid off the option money , and so far we 've each got about a hundred and fifty dollars , " Haimsohn said . " I 've been wondering about these fellows who finish writing a show and then fly off to Jamaica for a six-week vacation . " " We 'll be all right as soon as the investors are paid off , " Wise said . " There 's interest in ' Dames ' in London , and in Germany , Sweden , and Holland . Next to ' Promises , Promises , ' we 're the biggest musical hit . "
