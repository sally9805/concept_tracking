Fluttering high above the craggy mountains and lush rolling hills in northern Thailand , the tiny , single-engine aircraft picked its way through the mist , in search of a village airstrip . " I think that 's it , " the pilot shouted to a companion over the whine of the engine . Dipping down through the clouds , the plane came in at treetop level , then bounced into a 700-ft. clearing . Eager tribeswomen in turbans and blue-striped frocks rushed toward the visitors , smiling through betel-stained teeth . Their menfolk set about happily unloading medicine , food , seed and other supplies . " This is the one place in Southeast Asia , " the pilot beamed , " where we 're a little ahead of the Communists . " <P> Far ahead , in fact . Only three years ago , northern Thailand was considered one of the country 's most vulnerable areas for Communist subversion . Inhabited by 250,000 primitive , fiercely independent tribesmen , the area lived almost completely outside the law of Bangkok , haunted by superstition , disease and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opium . Today , Red terrorists are active both in the country 's northeast and in the Moslem provinces of the south . But thanks to a civic-action program that is nipping Red subversion in its earlier stages , the north is relatively free of trouble . " Nation building is what we 're doing , " says one official in Mae Rim , 107 miles from the Laos border . " We 're extending government influence to all within Thai borders . " <P> Schools &; Fruit Trees . A joint operation of Thailand , which contributes $500,000 a year , and of the U.S. , which kicks in another $500,000 a year ( mostly in planes and technical assistance ) , Thailand 's counterinsurgency effort is handled by the country 's 6,500-man Border Police Patrol . In 2 years , the patrol has helped build 66 village schools , 60 small airstrips for communication and supplies and scores of medical-aid stations and has dispensed friendly advice on everything from crops and animal husbandry to personal hygiene . In the process , the border patrol has welded 44 key border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyes and ears of northern Thailand 's anti-Communist defense system . <P> Working mainly with the more numerous Meo , Yao , Lisu , Lahu and Akha tribesmen , the border patrol has built two major " development centers " and three more are under way , complete with dispensaries , trading centers and schools . In the village of Huai Fuang near the Laos border , last week about 50 students sat in crisp regulation white shirts and khaki shorts in an open , thatched-roof classroom , learning to read and count from a border policeman whose platoon had supplied the class uniforms and haircuts . On the wall behind the teacher were three objects that symbolized the new presence : a Thai flag , a picture of Thailand 's King Bhumibol and Queen Sirikit and a picture of the Lord Buddha . The police had even directed the building of a network of bamboo pipes to carry fresh water into every household in the village .
