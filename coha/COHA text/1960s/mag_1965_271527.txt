At the Church of the Holy Spirit in Salinas , Calif. , one Sunday last month , Mrs. Phyllis Edwards , 48 , walked to the altar to minister at 8 o'clock Holy Communion . Dressed in a deaconess ' dark blue , nunlike robes surmounted by a deacon 's stole , Mrs. Edwards calmly intoned the prayers and then distributed the bread and wine of Communion , which had been consecrated by the church 's rector at a previous service . <P> The parishioners thereupon became the first Episcopalians in the U.S. to receive communion from a woman . The service took place - where else ? - in the diocese of California 's experiment-loving Bishop James A. Pike , who is de termined to ordain Mrs. Edwards to the diaconate . A widow with four chil dren , she is now one of about 70 active Episcopal deaconesses authorized by the church to perform social work and teach the catechism . <P> " Serious Division . " Unlike male deacons , for whom the office is normally a one-year prelude to ordination as a priest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administer sacraments to the sick . Pike believes that he can change this rule because of a word-switch in canon law made by the church 's General Convention last year ; women now are " ordered " deaconesses by a bishop , instead of " appointed . " The convention also dropped the canonical provision that deaconesses must be single or widowed , but Mrs. Edwards says , " I have no desire to marry again . " <P> Most clerics think that the change is purely verbal and balk at Pike 's plan Bishop Francis W. Lickfield of Quincy , Ill. , head of the Anglo-Catholic American Church Union , warned that the step could create " serious division " in the church . In the end , Pike postponed the ceremony until he can argue his case before next fall 's House of Bishops meeting . <P> St. Paul 's Misogynism . Pike believes that " there is no viable theological objection to women in holy orders , " and it is an argument that is slowly but surely taking force in Christianity . More than 70 U.S. Protestant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women have been ordained ministers in the Lutheran state churches of Denmark and Sweden and in a dozen Reformed and Evangelical churches of France , Germany and Eastern Europe . <P> Even in the Roman Catholic Church , where bishops overwhelmingly reject the idea , at least a few theologians wonder about the possibility of change . In a recent book , Peruvian Jesuit Jos Idigoras argued that there was no difference in the rites of ordination for deacons and deaconesses in early Christianity , and that St. Paul 's misogynistic teachings ( " I permit no woman to teach " ) must be interpreted in light of women 's position at the time . Some members of the St. Joan 's International Alliance , an association of equality-seeking Catholic women , have petitioned Rome to allow women the dignity of the priesthood.
