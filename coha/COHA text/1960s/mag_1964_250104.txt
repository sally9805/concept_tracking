During his trial on charges of swinging fellow Texans-to say nothing of assorted banks and financing companies-Billie Sol Estes objected vehemently to the presence of TV cameras in the courtroom . His objections were overruled : Estes was convicted and sentenced to eight years . In agreeing to consider his appeal last week , the Supreme Court did not concern itself with Billie Sol 's guilt or innocence . The sole question before the court is whether his unwilling TV performance prejudiced his right to a fair trial . <P> Whatever the eventual decision it could affect more than TV 's tireless insistence on sharing the newsman 's right to cover trials . In accepting Estes ' appeal , the Supreme Court involved it self in the kind of quarrel that has been stirred up whenever the press , in the exercise of its constitutionally guaranteed freedom , is accused of infringing a defendant 's constitutionally guaranteed right to a fair trial . <P> The Lesson of Dallas . The longstanding controversy is picking up fresh impetus . Last week Jon O. Newman , U S Attorney for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might prejudice a defendant 's rights . " If in doubt , " admonished Newman 's memo keep silent . " A New Jersey Supreme Court judge recently imposed a similar silence on every lawyer and policeman the state . In Rochester , NY two men awaiting trial on gambling charges won a temporary injunction against publication of their police records by a local newspaper . If such intelligence got out , they claimed , it would impair their chances for an impartial trial . After a few days , however , the court canceled the injunction . <P> Such actions reflect a prevalent opinion that the press is less concerned with impartial justice than with unthrottled crime coverage . It is an attitude that found support in the Warren Commission 's report on the Kennedy assassination . " The promulgation of a code of professional conduct governing representatives of all news media , " said the commission in summing up , " would be welcome evidence that the press had profited by the lesson of Dallas . " <P> That newspapers often try , and frequently decide , criminal cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even editors do not deny . This year a convicted wife-murderer , Dr. Sam Sheppard of Cleveland , was released for retrial after ten years in prison because a federal judge agreed with Sheppard 's contention that Cleveland papers had so inflamed public opinion as to destroy all possibility of cool justice . <P> Six years ago , Chicago papers seemed equally determined to convict a suspected killer . TERRORIST BARRY COOK ADMITS SLAYING WOMAN IN PARK ran one banner headline that was only part of a noisy press chorus demanding swift court retribution for the crime . This sort of coverage did not abate until Cook 's trial jury , obviously unresponsive to newspaper suggestion , acquitted the defendant . <P> Legal Support . Cook 's release despite the energetic newspaper campaign to have him executed , is cited by defenders of the press 's habit of trying cases in print . At discussions on press freedom and fair trial , Managing Editor Robert Notson of the Portland Oregonian has repeatedly and vainly asked lawyers and judges to name one occasion on which hostile newspaper publicity helped convict an innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
