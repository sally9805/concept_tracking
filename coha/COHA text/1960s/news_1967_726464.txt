txt The Arapahoes would never recognize their old camping grounds . A century ago they staged war dances on what has since become the lush golf course of Columbine Country Club . But for sheer frenzy , the dancing Indians probably could n't match the re ( ent goings-on here . In the space of a few days , more than two dozen blue and white concession tents , stocked with food and drink , have sprouted on the clubhouse grounds , Scores of television technicians have hauled in an estimated $5 million of electronic gear  --  from color cameras to microphones in trees that pick up the whack of a player 's shot . Workers have rigged bleachers , scoreboards and some 75 portable restrooms . And to keep expected crowds in check , groundskeepers have strung nearly 10 miles of nylon rope . It 's all part of one of golfing 's biggest spectacles , the PGA ( Professional Golfers Association ) Championship Tournament , which gets under way here at Columbine this morning with such big names as Arnold Palmer , Jack Nicklaus and Billy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work by nearly 1,000 golf enthusiasts  --  largely volunteers from Columbine and other nearby country clubs . A Mammoth Task Running a major golf tournament is a mammoth task And it 's a job that gets bigger each year thanks to golf 's growing popularity and to increasing television coverage of the sport . Attendance at the nation 's 40-odd tourneys that draw top golfing stars should exceed 2 million this year , up from 800,000 a decade ago Prize money will reach a record $5 million , five times the total 10 years ago . The PGA Championship at Columbine is one of the so-called big three golf tournaments ; the U S. Open and the Masters are the other two . Columbine , a 500-member club located 12 miles south of downtown Denver , is co-sponsoring the tourney with the PGA , an organization of 6,000 pros who run golf shops , give lessons and travel the professional golfing circuit . Columbine hopes to draw crowds totaling 60,000 to 65,000 during the tournament . It expects to clear as much as $250,000 from ticket receipts , food and drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights . What 's more , television and newspaper coverage should lend the club prestige and help heti ' , the membership roster full . Plenty of Headaches But there are plenty of headaches involved , too . Columbine figures it has nearly $300,000 tied up in the tournament , if the event flops , it could ruin the club . Bad weather is the biggest woi ry . Rain throughout the four to five-day tournament would slash gate receipts and concession sales , although the club is partly protected by a large advance sale of tickets . A ticket for the run of the tournament costs $25 . Moreover , until a few weeks ago , players were threatening to boycott Columbine unless the PGA gave them a greater voice in tournament scheduling . That dispute has since been resolved . Columbine 's interest in running the PGA Championship goes back to 1963 , when it sent a three-man delegation to Dallas to confer with PGA officials there for that year 's tournament . Several club members knew of the $100,000 profit that neighboring Cherry Hills Country Club reaped from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively young and little known club , was looking for ways to build its reputation . In the spring of 1964 , the PGA chose Columbine from among at least six other clubs bidcling for the 1966 tournament . But a flood in 1963 nearly wiped out the course and forced postponement of the tourney here until this year . i Firestone Country Club , Akron , originally scheduled as the site for this year 's tournament , agreed to swap dates ; it staged last year 's event in Columbine 's place . ) Spelling Out the Terms Columbine 's agreement with the PGA calls for the golfers group to provide the players , a field staff of six , a press aide and the prize money  --  a minimum of $150,000 this year . In return , the association expects to collect about $190,000 from ticket sales and advertising revenues , plus another $178,000 as its share of the television rights purchased by American Broadcasting Co . To Columbine fell the bulk of the tournament preparations . Right off , it faced a problem : The young age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tremendous amount of members ' volunteered time , but younger members usually are n't able to take much time off from their businesses to help out . The club did two things to case the problem . It named its president , Everett Collier , as general chairman of the tournament . A 60-year-old electrical contractor , the white-haired Mr. Collier shouldered many of the responsibilities that would normally fall to workers down the line . He estimates that in the past three years he has devoted about 5,000 hours to the job . Then , in early 1965 , the club hired a business manager for the event , J. Edwin Carter of New York , a former department store buyer and newspaper publisher who has managed sonic 100 golf tournaments . Club officials ' describe Mr. Carter as the tournament 's " insurance " against failure . As a professional manager . he provides the necessary know-how , including invaluable promotional ideas tested at other tournaments . Mr. Collier , of course , is n't paid for his work Mr. Carter , however , stands to earn about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the profits . He has managed several other tournaments since starting to work with Columbine . To raise needed funds for Columbine , Mr. Carter relied heavily on selling advertising in the 210-page tournament program . National oncerns , many of them golf equipment manufacturers , provide about 70 ' ' of the ad money . i The rest comes from local merchants solicited by club members . " You ca n't use paid sales-7 men  --  they 're too high pressure , " Mr. Carter explains . Opposition From Retailers Even so , the club ran into opposition from retailers . Many complained  --  and a few club members agreed  --  that the ads were overpriced . The Denver Retail Merchants Association , in fact , urged its members not to buy ads . A full-pa , ge , four-color ad costs $1,400 . Mr. Collier concedes this is " quite expensive , " but he argues that the programs are saved as souvenirs and re-read several times by golf fans . Since 1964 , Columbine has poured more than 5135.000 into improving its course for the tournament . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the 1965 flood . Little flood damage is visible today , though . Two new greens have been designed , and portions of four other holes rebuilt . Some 120 trees  --  elms and evergreens  - -  were brought in to replace those uprooted by floodwaters Once a river bed , the relatively flat course has been lengthened by 500 yards to 7,4361 yards . making it the longest course on which the PGA Championship has been played . One reason for the added length was that the course was c onsidered too easy for the pros ; Denver 's mile-high altitude allows a ball to fly about 7f further than it would in the heavier air at sea level . Lots of Fertilizer To keep the course in top shape , Columbine has boosted its maintenance budget to $115,000 from $85,000 in prior years . Groundskeepers mow each green daily to a height of 3-16 of an inch . Final touches for the pros include narrowing the fairways to between 90 and 120 feet from a normal 150 feet and allowing the rough to grow to 41 , : - to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some Columbine members are awed by the improved course . " It 's a real monster , " says banker William Garrison . " I 'm sure that all our handicaps have gone up by six or seven strokes . " After the tournament , the course will be maintained basically in its present form , although tees will be moved forward to shorten some holes , a few traps will be removed and the fairways will be widened . The tournament will require some 200 caddies , most of whom were recruited from Columbine and other clubs and specially trained for the event . For their work , the caddies , all over 16 years old , will earn a minimum of $7.50 a round , paid by the players . Those fortunate enough to work for winning players may receive up to 5% of the player 's prize money , or as much as $1,500 . To keep out gate crashers and control crowds , Columbine will use 200 volunteer marshals and 40 paid men from a private detective agency , as well as state police and the 40-man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's men will be on horseback . The club has also purchased extra liability and property damage insurance for a premium of $13,000 . Amusement Enterprises of Dallas , the tournament 's concessionaire , expects food and drink sales to total $60,000 . It has laid in some 14,000 gallons of beer , 60,000 hot dogs , 400 galIons of mustard and 25,000 ice cream bars .
