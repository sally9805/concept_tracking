Half a dozen of the most potent drugs used by physicians have been known for years to cause changes in the chromosomes in some of the body 's cells , with the parallel risk that they might also cause genetic defects if the patient later became a parent . Up to now , such drugs have been used only in the treatment of advanced cancer , so the danger to children has been minimal . But last week , in the journal Science , a team of researchers at the State Uni- versity of New York in Buffalo reported that LSD ( lysergic acid diethylamide ) , the favorite magic carpet of psychedelic trippers may produce the same sort of chromosomal damage . <P> Geneticist Maimon J. Cohen and his colleagues were making a highly preliminary report . They had found this phenomenon in the blood of only three people . From two healthy subjects they drew blood , then grew the white cells in the test tube . When LSD , in varying concentrations , was added for durations of four to 48 hours , the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as tenfold over the small number usually found in healthy cells . <P> Then the investigators took blood from a 51-year-old schizophrenic , who had been given LSD under careful medical supervision 15 times in six years . In his cells , the number of broken chromosomes was more than three times normal . <P> <P> " The significance of these findings can not yet be assessed fully , " says the Buffalo group . There is no certainty that damage to chromosomes in blood cells is accompanied by similar damage in germ cells-sperm or ova . But the two kinds of damage have been shown to go together after excessive radiation , and the same may be true after repeated use of LSD . Blood specimens from patients who have " flipped " and become psychotic after LSD are now being sent to Buffalo to see whether the phenomenon is widespread .
