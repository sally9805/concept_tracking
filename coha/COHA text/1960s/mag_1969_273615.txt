The Proverbial Woman <P> Sir : Your article on Ethel Kennedy April 25 is a great tribute to a woman of exceeding fortitude . The only greater tribute to this virtuous woman is found in Proverbs 31 : 10-31 : <P> A perfect wife-who can find her ? <P> She is far beyond the price of pearls . <P> Her husband 's heart has confidence in <P> her , <P> from her he will derive no little profit . <P> Advantage and not hurt she brings him <P> all the days of her life . . . <P> She is clothed in strength and dignity , <P> she can laugh at the days to come . <P> When she opens her mouth , she does <P> so wisely ; <P> on her tongue is kindly instruction . <P> She keeps good watch on the conduct <P> of her household , <P> no bread of idleness for her . <P> Her sons stand up and proclaim her <P> blessed , <P> her husband , too , sings her praises : <P> " Many women have done admirable <P> things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charm is deceitful , and beauty empty ; <P> the woman who is wise is the one to <P> praise . <P> Give her a share in what her hands <P> have worked for , <P> and let her works tell her praises at <P> the city gates . <P> It 's a truism that the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world . If American women emulate their ideal , then Robert Kennedy 's dream of a Newer World would not be far in the offing . <P> ( THE REV . ) GEORGE B. DYER , O.P. <P> St. Pius Priory <P> Chicago <P> Strike at the Factory <P> Sir : Harvard cover story April 18 is superb ! <P> As a Harvard College alumnus ( A.B. , 1939 ) , I think your " faceless factory " analysis is apt . It is the Harvard Corporation that must go ! Harvard and similar institutions should be run by scholars and scientists ( faculty ) , some students , outside laymen . <P> EDWARD S. BABCOX JR . <P> Shaker Heights , Ohio <P> Sir : When Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bust the heads of innocent children seeking to discover the relationship of their university to the world , I can only conclude that the university is trying to hide evidence of various actions , various bad actions , such as expansion into surrounding urban areas , or research for the War Department ( somehow the old name seems more appropriate ) , or connections with the CIA . Such actions are wrong ; they are tantamount to murder . And just as any self-respecting citizen would act to prevent a murder , we students must act to prevent the university from committing murder in a more discreet , more scholarly fashion . If this involves shutting down the university , so be it . <P> JUAN JEWELL , ' 72 <P> University of Chicago <P> Chicago
