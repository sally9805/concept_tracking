The British government last week announced that it is making oral contraceptives available at trifling cost under the National Health Service to Britain 's women , who number 12,250,000 in the child-bearing ( 15-49 ) age bracket . The measure , though duly limited by requiring doctors ' prescriptions , seemed a significant step toward massive , government-paid support for curbing a nation 's population . Yet much concern in the House of Commons was over the possible but unpredictable cost to the treasury. * <P> For each prescription , which is expected to cover a month 's supply of 20 pills , a woman under NHS will pay a token charge of 2 shillings ( 28 ) . The government will pay the rest , estimated at $2.08 a month . Health Minister Enoch Powell told Commons that he hoped doctors would prescribe the pills only when they had good reason to believe that a woman should avoid pregnancy . But in effect he conceded defeat in advance : " It is not for me to indicate to doctors what they should decide , for medical reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left it up to doctors to decide whether or not to prescribe the pills for unmarried women . <P> <P> *When dollar-conscious Britain decided to try out oral contraceptives developed in the U.S. , doctors in Birmingham thought they might cut the cost by cutting the dose . U.S. authorities had just approved a cut from 10 mg. per pill ( taken 20 days a month ) of norethynodrel ( trade-named Enovid in the U.S. , Conovid in Britain by G. D. Searle &; Co. ) to 5 mg . The British cut it to 2.5 mg . The policy proved to be penny-wise and pound-foolish : of the first 48 women who took the half-dose pills , 14 became pregnant . Later trials switched to a 5-mg. dose , and then there was only one pregnancy among 215 women .
