txt President Johnson said today that the time had come for " austerity " and a " total national effort " to win the war and peace in Vietnam and solve domestic problems . In a fiery speech to the annual convention of the National Farmers Union , Mr. Johnson also made it clear that he was not going to alter his Vietnam war policy despite Communist military successes and opposition to his renomination within the Democratic party . Sometimes pounding on the lectern , sometimes jabbing a finger at the 1,000 persons in the audience , the President lauded his diplomatic advisers and military leaders and . Clescribed critics who would do less in Vietnam as those who would " tuck our tail and violate our commitments . " Desire for Peace At one point he said : " We love nothing more than peace , but we hate nothing worse than surrender and cowardice . " The President and Mrs. Johnson took a ' few extra hours to fly here on their way back to Washington from a weekend at their Texas ranch . The President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Leamington Hotel served as the opening round of a campaign to fight back . 1 The President chose the home state of one of his chief Democratic critics , Senator Eugene J. McCarthy , to make the speech . The farmers union delegates responded with strong applause when the President described his anti-inflation program as austere . Appeal Stated The President put his appeal this way : " Your ? Zit sident has come here to as you people , and all the other people of this nation , to join us in a total national effort to win the war , to win the peace , and to complete the job that must be done here at home . " I ask all of you to join in a program of national austerity to insure that our economy will prosper and that our fiscal position will be sound . " But the delegates were noticeably quiet when he mentioned two of the major elements of his " austerity " program ? a 10 per cent surcharge on taxes and a $3-billion to $4-billion cut in Federal spending within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The budget cuts now being considered with Congressional leaders , the President said , are in nondefense , non-Vietnam items " all across the board . " The farm audience did applaud , however , the President 's suggestion that all nonessential travel outside the Western hemisphere be postponed . The delegates also cheered the President 's pledge to help the farmer increase his bargaining power , but there was some skepticism afterward . The reaction of E. W. Smith , president of the North Dakota Farmers Union , was typical . " We 're still going to demand action and not words , " Mr. Smith said . A number of delegates also said they wished that the President had talked more about farm problems and less about Vietnam . The farmers union , like many other organizations , is divided over the , war . The group has about 250,000 families as members . In his defense of his Vietnam policy and in a call for unity to support " our own security , " Mr. Johnson did not refer directly to his two opponents for the Democratic Presidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator McCarthy . But his words unmistakably suggested That the " A to Z " reappraisal of war strategy disclosed by Secretary of State Dean Rusk a week ago would not lead to any basic change in policy . This policy , he said , seeks a middle ground between two ex tremes ? those who would " go in quickly with all flags flying and get it over with quickly , regardless of the dangers involved , " and those who think " that you can just have peace by talking for it , by wishing for it , by saying you want it , and that all you need do is pull back to the cities . " As for the first " extreme , " the President said , " we do not seek a wider war . " As for the second , he said the recent enemy offensive showed that lives could not be saved " by moving the battlefield in from the mountains to the cities . "                  @ @ @
