MARK TWAIN 'S LETTERS FROM HAWAII edited by A. Grove Day . 298 pages . Appleton-Century. $5.95 . <P> <P> In 1866 , when he toured the Hawaiian Islands , Mark Twain planted a monkeypod tree which lived to a great age and developed to enormous proportions . What he did for the tree he also did for his career . When Twain sailed for Honolulu as a South Pacific correspondent for the powerful , popular Sacramento Union , his literary reputation rested uncertainly on one widely read newspaper story : " The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County . " When he returned to California four months later , his newsy and engaging letters from Hawaii had made him " the best-known honest man on the Pacific Coast .

Astride a spavined horse named Oahu , he viewed a bone-strewn battleground , exotic foliage , and " long-haired , saddle-colored maidens " with the rapt admiration of a Peeping Tom newly admitted to Eden . <P> " I had rather smell Honolulu at sun set , " he said , " than the old police courtroom in San Francisco .

" Sometimes he reported earnestly , filing statistic-studded essays on the whaling and sugar industries . He was at his best when he gave in to his sense of humor . Of lower-class Hawaiians traveling on an inter-island schooner , he reported that " as soon as we set sail the natives all laid down on deck as thick as Negroes in a slave pen , and smoked and conversed and captured vermin and ate them , spit on each other , and were truly sociable . " Hawaiian oranges were delicious , although " I seldom eat more than 10 or 15 at a sitting , however , because I despise to see anybody gormandize. "
