txt The auto industry once again is yielding to the urge to woo customers by bragging about the number of horses under the hood . The five major auto company presidents agreed in 1957 to a ban on speed and horsepower promotion . This followed pressure from 11 Congressional subcommittee investigating traffic safety ; it also was partly due to the rising cost and the crash publicity risks of factory participation in stock car racing . But , to some in the industry , the appeal to a motorist of controlling a powerful engine has proved too potent a sales lure to leave unused . Some of the returns to the speed theme are subtle . When General Motors Corp . ' s Chevrolet division : reco.lt.y launched a supercharged version of its compact Corvair. the car was called the Corvair Monza Spyder. the two last names respectively suggesting an Italian race course and a West German racing sports car . The Spyder packs 88 ' ; more horsepower ( 150 ) than the earlier Monza . Chevrolet 's ads have the Spyder " skirring " around curves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly hastily . " Chrysler 's 300-H Movie Chrysler Corp. , leaves little doubt what it is driving at with a new movie showing at one point a souped-up version of its Chrysler 300-H , tooling along a beach at 189 miles an hour . But the 60 copies of the film are meant to be Ishown only to luncheon groups , sports car clubs and the like , not to mass TV audiences . 11 ' an official says . Clear evidence of the returning stress on horsepower was seen at the recent Chicago Auto Show . In addition to Chevrolet 's Spyder , other newly hopped-up passenger cars included : A supercharged 215-horsepower version of the compact Oldsmobile F-85 , which had a top horsepower of 185 previously ; a Galaxie . Ford 's full-sired car . with a 405-horsepower engine that far outstrips its previously most powerful , 300-horsepower unit ; an intermediatesized Ford Fairlane ? with 164 horsepower compared with a former top of 143 ; a 410-horsepower Plymouth . which had only 305 horsepower in its previously most powerful 1962 model engine . The auto company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Association , pledged " to encourage owners and drivers to evaluate passenger cars in terms of useful power and ability to afford safe , reliable and comfortable transportation . rather than in terms of capacity for speed . " Their resolution specifically banned factory participation in auto racing and speed and acceleration tests or the advertising of race results , whether they participated or not . Some observers thought the resolution would stick , despite a history in the industry of broken bans on speed promotions . Stock car racing activities , designed to prove cars fast and durable , had been costing the companies an estimated $6 million annually . ' Hot ' Cars a Gambit But even before the ink was dry on the pact , there . teas evidence that ad copywriters were figuring ways to convey to their readers that , even if the ads sounded more conservative , the cars-had lost none of their zit ) . One gambit was to describe a car as " hot , " which could conceivably mean that it was selling well , not that it was fast . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trend , but a source close to the association agrees that the " spirit , " if not the letter , of the agreement has been well shattered . He notes , however , that it was a " gentleman 's type of agreement , " and if the gentlemen have chucked their pledge , nothing will be done about it , at least not until there is a public outcry . The extent to which auto makers have returned to stock car racing , is hard to determine , since participation usually is concealed . But reporters at the recent 500-mile stock car race at Daytona , Fla. , noticed that engineers and officials of GM 's Pontiac division were touch in evidence in the pit area . Puntiaes placed one-two-three in the race . Why are speed and power promotion so irresistible ? Auto merchandisers concede that these considerations seldom are at the top of the list in surveys of why people buy cars . But a Chrysler advertising man says : " Some of the glory of the high speed cars rubs off . It 's a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
