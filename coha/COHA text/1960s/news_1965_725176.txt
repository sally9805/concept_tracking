txt When GOP chieftains meet next week in Washington they will bump head on into this question : Should the party hold a special national convention next year ? The idea belongs to Michigan Gov . George Romney . And he is expected to throw it out on the table when the Republican Coordinating Committee meets on Monday . Mr. Romney 's idea is for Republicans to meet to forge a new statement of party policy . Some others on the 28-member GOP committee back the Romney scheme ? in principle . However , it poses problems . How would it be implemented ? How would delegates be picked ? What guarantee is there that those picked would have a different approach to the issues ? And would such a convention knit ? the party 's moderate-conservative schism or deepen it ? Those are tough questions . But they are about to be asked . A key challenge facing American foreign aid boils down to " proteins . " The problem is how to get more high protein food to poorer nations and then get them to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surplus wheat , for instance , are down to 736 million bushels  --  from 890 million last year . In 1960 wheat stockpiles topped one billion bushels . Soybeans are high on proteins . But they are n't in surplus at all . Neither is rice . All of this is cropping up to bother experts now making a high-level review of American foreign aid policies . The White House hopes many countries can hike their own high-protein food outputs . But the United States will still have to pitch in . President Johnson therefore is looking at plans to buy high-protein foods on the domestic market and ship them to protein-shy nations . The Secretary of Agriculture is already authorized to buy dairy products to that end . This list may now broaden . Trends .. Every department in Washington is now Iracticing the art of the five-year budget a la McNamara . It 's a new procedure . Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara pioneered it in his department . It involves mapping out budgets for fiscal 1967 , how much they will cost , and how they fit into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all departments to do it that way . And five-year plans are now pouring into the Budget Bureau , all loaded with things called " options " and " cost effectiveness " estimates . The President wants options . He wants to know , for instance , if he should group all pollution activity under the new Department of Housing and Urban Development or under Health , Education , and Welfare . Or should he spread it out through several agencies ? Between now and mid-January the President will sit down and sift budgets and options with each department and out will pop a policy . How and why .. . Vietnam is something like a sieve . Infiltrating North Vietnamese sift southward through the mountains with comparative ease . Nor will the United States plug these holes anytime soon . It just is n't able to yet . Sea routes have been severed easily by the Navy . But land routes are another matter . A stop-gap effort will mount in the air soon to harass the land routes in the mountains , especially along the borders of Laos and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But to cut the routes finally demands that the mountain regions themselves be seized . This is still too big a job for the available United States forces . Washington thinks it will take the massive buildup of American forces now contemplated to plug the sieve . And even then it wo n't be easy . One of the hottest fights in the poverty war is raging in the House committee investigating the program . A Democrat , Rep. Sam M. Gibbons of Florida , has been visiting poverty programs in what some consider " model " communities . His reports have been glowing . But a Republican , Charles E. Goodell of New York , has been visiting poverty trouble spots . His reports have been anything but glowing . He charges administrative ineptitude and insists the poor are being bypassed . Furious committee Democrats think Mr. Goodell is just trying to make political hay . And Mr. Goodell says the Democrats have sat on their hands and conducted " superficial " investigations . It 's a hot pocket in the poverty war .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
