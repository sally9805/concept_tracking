txt Almost overnight a one-sided presidential race has taken on the appearance of a neckand-neck contest that could go either way . Hours before the voting booths opened both Gallup and Harris Polls called the race a toss-up . A Nixon 2 percent lead , as now seen by Gallup , narrowed to 1 percent when the pollster took into account the undecided vote . Mr. Nixon now was given a 2 percent edge by Harris . This was close enough , according to the pollster , to " throw the final outcome in doubt . " State-by-state surveys , conducted by several newspapers , were also showing Hum- phrey gains . But they were also showing Mr. Nixon with a rather firm edge . The New York Times on Nov. 4 published a state-by-state survey , relying on representatives of that paper in each state , indicating a tightening race . But it still gave Mr. Nixon the lead in 30 states with 299 electoral votes needed to win : 270 electoral votes . Assessment recalled Mr. Humphrey was seen as the leader in eight states plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nov. 3 the Washington Post published a similar survey showing Mr. Nixon leading in 31 states with 295 electoral votes . Mr. Humphrey was believed to be ahead in seven states plus the District of Columbia with 67 electoral votes . The Christian Science Monitor in a state- by-state assessment published Oct. 30 gave Mr. Nixon 34 states with 333 electoral votes  --  but noted that Mr. Humphrey was continuing to show gains . Mr. Humphrey was given six states plus the District of Columbia . However , Monitor writers in the 50 states reported that , additionally , Mr. Humphrey had become the possible winner in 17 states . Together this comes to 286 electoral votes . The week before Monitor writers reported that Mr. Humphrey had gained on Mr. Nixon in 24 states with 261 electoral votes over the previous two-week period . . Thus , for the last three weeks , there has been ample evidence of a dramatic rise in Mr. Humphrey 's support . But would this be enough for Mr. Hum* // *Nixon-Humphrey race looks closer in polls // phrey to win or even to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upsurge more appearance than reality ? And was Mr. Nixon actually on the verge of a decisive victory ? These were questions that could only be asked as the voters cast their ballots . They alone had the answer . It now is thousands of campaign miles since the snows of New Hampshire . The oratory and the battling are finally over . No one can be certain of the effects of last-minute campaigning . President Johnson joined Mr. Humphrey in the campaign for the first time , pleading with a large Houston Astrodome audience to elect his Vice-President as his successor . Mr. Johnson called Hubert H. Humphrey " a healer and a builder who had labored not to generate suspicion and fear among our people , but to inspire them with confidence in their ability to live together . " Richard M. Nixon , on NBC 's " Meet the Press , " volunteered to fly to Paris or Saigon after the election to move peace talks off dead center . Mr. Nixon said he was fully behind the President in his peace move in Vietnam . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bombing halt was politically motivated in an attempt by the President to help Mr. Humphrey win the election . Meanwhile . George C. Wallace , too , was claiming victory for himself . Also , in Atlanta , Mr. Wallace accused the Republicans of attempting to bargain with this electorate . " Our electors are n't going to have anything to do with him , " he said . On ABC 's " Issues and Answers " Mr. Wallace repeated his position in the event of an electoral vote that does not provide either of the three candidates with a victory . He said his terms for releasing his own presidential electors to one of the other candidates still involved a public avowal of support of Mr. Wallace 's own views  --  to be broadcast on national television by any candidate hoping to gain Wallace support in the electoral college . Crowds on rise The bombing halt seemed to be helping the Vice-President as the election neared . His crowds suddenly were bigger , and his own rising enthusiasm seemed to reflect the candidate who felt he was seeing better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own victory , a rite usually expected just before the vote . " People arc coming to us by the thousands , " Mr. Humphrey said . " Whether they are coming fast enough and soon enough , only the election can tell . " But Mr. Nixon , too , was exuberant , in the manner of a candidate fully expecting to win . He repeated that his victory margin would be from 3 million to 5 million . But he again urged that his workers intensify their efforts to get out the vote in his behalf . He called for a vote that would provide him with a " mandate , " big enough to keep the race from becoming deadlocked in the electoral college . The American public plainly wants a change . The polls show this . Political leaders of both parties are convinced of this . Mr. Nixon saw this early , and this has been the central theme in his campaign . Mr. Humphrey saw it , too , and he has been struggling to extricate himself from the present administration and to present himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own ways for attacking pressing problems at home and abroad  --  and that as president he would be " captain of the team " whereas as Vice-President he was only a " member of the team .
