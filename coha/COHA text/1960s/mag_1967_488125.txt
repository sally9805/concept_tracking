I have been out of town for some time and must try to catch up . Arthur Penn 's Bonnie and Clyde is a mesmeric , shocking , often delightful and far from perfect film , and I think I know why it has generated an almost excessive amount of controversy . The complaint that it is not an accurate account of the Dust Bowl 1930s is beside the point , since it is not , nor intended to be , an accurate account of any decade . Its pale , nostalgic Technicolor and insistence on stilted group snapshots ; on occasion , the marionette attitudes of its performers and syncopated pace of its action , make clear that it is dealing with legend , not life . The movie 's relevance , moreover , is less to its own era than to ours . The fun-loving Barrow gang , laughing and lark ? ing its murderous way through the depression-stunned small towns of the Southwest , rootless , aimless , squalid and lethal , was not , it now seems , a poisonous symbol of temporary crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As Penn tells it , Bonnie and Clyde robbed banks because they had no idea who they were . The money they got was never more than enough to keep them in hamburgers until they could pull a next job , but it was not fear of hunger that drove them , it was fear of anonymity . " We rob banks , " they announced to strangers on the road , and smirked as they said it ; they squandered the cash but treasured the press clippings They did not kill from viciousness but from incompetence , and Clyde was unable to make love to Bonnie in their infantile world of romance on the run . All this should strike the viewer with icy familiarity in our day of motorcycle gangs and flower children , Nazi insignia , cheap beads , incense , drugs , apathy and motiveless violence . I have some doubt that Bonnie and Clyde were quite the hallucinated children that Penn makes them , but in retrospective fiction they legitimately become so The fault of the picture is that emotionally it is somewhat untrustworthy The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is eloquent , intelligent and marvelously plastic . Indeed , in Penn 's hands it becomes too plastic , for the director seems uncertain as to his attitude toward his material , and hisplayers dexterously act it In a variety of styles . At times one seems to be entirely on the outside , witnessing a clinical demonstration ; then the filter shifts and we are enveloped in sudsy sentiment . Passages are offered in an estranging , mocking slapstick , only to merge into old-fashioned chase melodrama and then into the pain of real emotion and real laceration from real bullets . The effect is morally queasy ; it leads to charges of exploitation , sensationalism and irresponsibility . This was perhaps bound to happen , but it may be unfair . I think Penn wanted to make a picture that , through poetic remove from the extravagance of its incidents , would both gratify as entertainment and instruct as fable It is not easy to drive that tandem vehicle , but Bonnie and Clyde comes near enough success to make its intention clear . Shirley Clarke , a director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigate extreme situations ( The Connection , The Cool World ) , has made in Portrait of Jason one of the most daring films ever screened . I refer at this point not to the content of the picture  --  which is certainly daring in the usual sense  --  but to its structural idea : for an hour and three-quarters one camera holds its eye on one man , sitting , lounging , posing in a smallroom and talking about himself . You would suppose that , whatever the merit of such a project for the specialist 's archives , it could not possibly work as public entertainment . But it does work , and brilliantly . Miss Clarke has been both resourceful and acute . By recording on the sound track the voices of herself and her associates , exchanging technical information or cueing the subject , by frequently permitting the picture to go out of focus and occasionally allowing the screen to fall dark as the voice carries on , she turns the making of the picture into an aspect of its content . For me , Miss Clarke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus too often and for too long at a time . I am told that her purpose was to relieve the viewer at moments when she thought the intensity of the image was becoming excessive  --  above a reasonable pain threshold  --  but as I watched , the device seemed in use primarily to mark breaks or transitions and , like any repeated film convention of that sort , it quickly became obtrusive . Nevertheless , Miss Clarke 's style of on-set informality ( which she used even more elaborately in The Connection , where the text of the original play supplied the motive ) gives her work a sense of immediacy that is electrifying . And Miss Clarke was acute in discernbig the cinematic possibilities of the man who calls himself Jason . This homosexual Negro mate prostitute and sometime houseboy is gifted with a power to convey his ideas and impose his personality that is altogether exceptional . His body is genuinely elegant and his face is so eloquent of his thoughts as to seem handsome , which indeed it is not . He is intelligent , witty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been places and done things and knows to a fine tuning how to play back his life . He is also sell-deluded and desperate ; his compulsive confessions are near-mad attempts to break himself into endurable fragments , his iterated determination to become a night-club performer is an agony of self-contempt ( and his demonstration of what his act might be is an embarrassment almost beyond endurance ; Jason has talent only for exhibiting himself ) . The sight and sound of this man laughing at himself can be called , with almost no hyperbole , a hellish spectacle . The suspense of the picture , in short , is whether or not Jason can get through it without going completely to pieces . By dint of alcohol , marijuana and innumerable cigarettes , refreshed by rests from time to time , he just manages . A magnificent picture  --  and I suspect that if I were as open as Jason I would be disgusted with myself for having sat through it . I am not a sadist or a voyeur , 446 I do n't crowd around street calamities or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there and allow this pathetic , appalling man to tell me his story ? Particularly toward the end , when an off-camera voice goads him to higher emotional excesses , why did n't I flee such suffering ? I do n't know whether or not Jason was a conspirator in that sudden attack ; it may have been all camp . In any case , it was ugly . Of course , I " sympathize " with Jason  --  that is , I pity him  --  but what good is that to him or me ? It is not true that all human experience is instructive ? I can learn from Jason nothing that is of the slightest use to me , and since I have neither the intention nor the means to be of any use to him . I am treating him as a strange thing , not a fellow man . All that insight and wit is remarkable only because it is incongruous ; I 've heard better talk a thousand times , and I 'm patronizing Jason by extolling his human attributes . I 'm a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there to report on the picture , but that too is not really honest ? I 've walked out on more movies than I can remember . No , I stayed because Miss Clarke and her terrible discovery compelled me to stay . A magnificent picture , and a damned wicked one . I wish that some of Shirley Clarke 's talent for exposition had been available for Titicut Follies . Its director , Frederick Wiseman , is a man clearly motivated by social zeal , but he does not appear to understand that the meaning of what a camera shows is as much in the context as in the content  --  a generalization that has particular force when the scene is the Bridgewater State Hospital for the criminally insane . As far as content is concerned , Mr. Wiseman is relentlessly explicit . His documentation amply confirms what one had suspected  --  that Bridgewater , and presumably dozens of institutions like it across the country , are Gothic anachronisms . Its corridors , cells , common rooms and baths , with their exposed pipes . naked lights , peeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large-mammal house in an old-fashioned zoo . The resemblance is heightened by the life of the place : the inmates spend a large part of their time naked in the airless warmth and the large , slow-moving guards treat them with the indulgent informality of keepers for their charges . However , I ca n't recall ever seeing a zoo custodian bait the animals , as some of the guards ride their prisoners . It looks cruel , but I do n't know that it is ; the men may get some satisfaction from the rough barking back and forth  --  they looked to be under sedation and would perhaps sink into apathy if not riled up And since I was given no clue as to the mental prognosis for the group of patients shown in such scenes , I can not judge whether or not purely custodial care is the best that can be done for them . There are some doctors about the place  --  a very few  --  presumably devoting themselves to minds that might be cured . The one shown most prominently speaks with a heavy European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seems bent on winning debating points with his patients . He , does n't look to be the ideal man to deal with sick young men of rather provincial American backgrounds , but , again , he may be doing a good job under the circumstances . I 'm not going to jump him merely because he 's a type I would do a good deal to avoid  --  perhaps getting out of his clutches is part of the idea . I watched a sad old man being forcibly fed in what looked like a slum kitchen . The doctor stood on a chair to pour the food down the tube , using as a container one of those cartons you find at a supermarket delicatessen counter , a cigarette dangling from his lips as he administered the nourishment . It was not an elegant scene , but when the ordeal was over the doctor gave the obdurate old fellow a rough pat and said he was a good patient . That may count for a lot . And what about the musical show that gives the picture its name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The camera never finds the performers off-stage . Are they the Bridgewater elite , is the show a part of their therapy , how does the audience respond ( there is not a single shot into the house ) , is this a regular feature of the hospital life ? No one could be interested in the ghoulish jamboree for its own merits , and if you do n't know what it means in the Bridgewater setting there is not much to be gained from enduring it . The film makes clear  --  what we already know  --  that institutions like Bridgewater are ill-equipped and understaffed ( except for the guards , who seem to congregate like elephants in the cramped alleys ) . Recreation is almost nonexistent ( a bare exercise ground where monomaniacs harangue their fellows , a birthday party , a tense little woman trying to get men in their 50s and 60s to play a game suitable for 5 year olds ) It is shameful , but that it is a snake pit , I 'm not prepared to say . That is a matter of context @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical TV network one-hour " controversy . " I feel expected to express outrage , and am willing to do so  --  something is obviously very wrong . But before I begin yelling I need to know the quality of the iniquity and the identity of the villains . THE DiaTwig/October 30 , 1967
