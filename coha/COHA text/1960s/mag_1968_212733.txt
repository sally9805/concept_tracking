Pop War GORE AND IGOR by Meyer Levin. 315 pages . Simon &; Schuster. $5.95 . <P> THE TOWER OF BABEL by Morris L. West . 361 pages . Morrow . $5.95 . <P> <P> The Arab-Israeli eruption of last June was a pop war , unless you happened to be an Arab or an Israeli , and a pop war novel about it is a provocation no truce commission could have been expected to prevent . Meyer Levin ( Compulsion ) has fired off a rooty-tooty , pot-woozy , **41;2061;TOOLONG novel about how it was n't in the Sinai campaign . <P> Levin 's principals are Gore Taylor , a young American protest singer , and Igor Mikhailovitch , a young Russian protest poet , who meet in Israel as the Six-Day War is about to start . So Gore drives this fantastic ambulance , and Igor fixes a Russian tank captured from the Arabs . They become great buddies , of course , while a lot of studs get their brains shot out . But mainly , the war as here described amid all this profound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a fraternity picnic . All the action moves along double time , like a fast-motion film ; everything is jerky , smaller than human . With so much motion , there is no time for motive . War , sex , poetry and friendship demand some viewpoint from the author . Levin supplies none . <P> A companion volume of sorts is The Tower of Babel , a spy novel about Middle East tensions in the period just before the Six-Day War ; it has no faults except that it is neither tense nor in any way Middle Eastern . The wily Lebanese banker , the fanatic Syrian colonel , the Israeli undercover agent and his trusty Damascan mistress all speak as if their lines had been written for them by-to pick an absurd example-a plonking Australian novelist named Morris West , author of The Shoes of the Fisherman . This is Eric Ambler territory , and no Western writer less accustomed to its rigors should go out in the Mideast sun .                  @ @ @
