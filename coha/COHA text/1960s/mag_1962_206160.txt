Like most airline passengers , Los Angeles Lawyer Charles E. Wills shuffled patiently through the electronic bureaucracy of reservations , confirmations and reconfirmations with the blind faith that when the right time came , he would be aboard the right plane . But on Oct. 11 , 1959 , when he showed up at St. Louis ' airport an hour before he was scheduled to take off for Los Angeles on TWA 's Flight 77 , he was told that his seat in the tourist-class section of the plane had been given to a ticket-holding fellow traveler-from first class . <P> TWA , following a practice indulged in by most airlines , had " overbooked " the flight , counting on enough cancellations at the last minute to squeeze everybody aboard . But there were fewer no-shows than expected , and Flight 77 was in trouble . Wills finally got to Los Angeles on another airline , 4 hours late . <P> Wills decided to sue , acted as his own attorney in the case . Says Wills : " I 'm a guy who can be pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the idea of this fellow jerking the ticket out of my hand . " At the trial , he pointed out that his tourist reservation was made prior to the first-class reservation of the passenger for whom he was bumped and contended that he , a tourist-class passenger , had been discriminated against . <P> Los Angeles Federal District Judge William C. Mathes last week ruled that TWA will have to pay Wills $5,001.54 . The $5,000 was an " award of exemplary damages , " as a warning and example to the rest of the industry ; the $1.54 was for a long-distance phone call Wills made to his wife to tell her he would be getting home late . <P> Taking TWA to task for overbooking , Judge Mathes cited 12,166 " oversales " in TWA domestic flights between July and December 1959 that resulted in 4,129 bumpings . But airlines have their problems . Experience has shown that 10% of those who reserve space two weeks before a flight fail to show at flight time , 5% of those with one-week reservations . The carriers are left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the no-shows demand ( and get ) their money back . The U.S. 's eleven major airlines recently reached agreement on a new policy : in the future , no-shows who do not cancel their reservations before flight time will not be refunded the full price of their ticket-the penalty will be about 50% of the fare up to a maximum of $50 . If CAB approves , the new rule will go into effect March 1 .
