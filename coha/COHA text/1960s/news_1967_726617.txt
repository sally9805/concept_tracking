txt Sen. J. W. Fulbright sees the best prospect for Vietnam peace now in United Nations action . He says the " most logical " and " most important " thing to be done now " is for the Security Council to take up the Vietnam situation as a procedural matter . " In an interview that focused on several important issues of the day , the Arkansas Democrat , chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee , underscored the UN role . He said a recommendation should be placed on the Security Council agenda calling , first , for a cease-fire in Vietnam and , second , for a reconvening of the Geneva conference . Wrong time now Such a recommendation , he noted , would be " procedural not substantive , " was not subject to veto , and could be placed on the agenda with only nine affirmative votes . He said he thought such recommendations might well gain the approval of all major powers . " I have suggested this procedural approach to Undersecretary of State Nicholas deB . Katzenbach .

Continued from Page 1 would follow through . " Perhaps they do n't want this , " he said . Although he approved of Ambassador Arthur J. Goldberg 's speech to the General Assembly , the Senator doubts this is a good moment for talking peace with Hanoi . " Cer. tainly , there is no probability of peace feelers now . " He feels there is great bitterness in Hanoi over the bombing and " also because of our refusal to respond to their ' gestures  --  not only the one involving Ashmore and Baggs , but there were two or three before that . " The Senator raised questions about the President 's unwillingness to see Harry Ashmore and William Baggs on their return from Hanoi : " After all , we have had only . three or four people who have been in North Vietnam . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would think the President would want to see these people and hear , personally , what they have to say . " ( Mr. Ashmore is a vice. - president of the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions in Santa Barbara , Calif . Mr. Baggs is editor of the Miami News . ) Senator Fulbright spoke with discouragement about the current state of the nation : " We are in a very serious situation . Our domestic fiscal situation is in a shambles . Inflation threatens us . It is the problems abroad that is the principal reason for our internal disarray . I do n't think we have been in such a disarray internally in the 25 years I 've been here . " ABM decision criticized He voiced his opposition to a presidential request for increased taxes that has not been accompanied by cutbacks in spending . He said he thought the move toward an antiballistic-missile defense was ridiculous at a moment when Mr. Johnson was seeking more revenue . Elaborating on the UN-Vietnam question , the Senator said if the objection is raised that this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still should seek a recommendation for the reconvening of the Geneva conference with its original participants , plus representatives from the NLF National Liberation Front , political arm of the Viet Cong , if they will come . " This subject of what is procedural and what is not is a tricky matter . That is why it would be good for the major powers to get together with U Thant in an informal meeting beforehand and decide on what would stand a chance of getting support on the basis of being procedural . " But I think these both are procedural . We wo n't be seeking a vote on the matters involved ? we would just be making recommendations . But if some would say that the cease-fire move would be substantive , then we could put the emphasis on recommending the reconvening of the Geneva conference . It 's worth trying ' " I 'm not sure . myself what could be worked out . But it is worth trying . I ca n't see why the other side , the Russians and others , would object to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on both sides , have from time to time said the principles of the Geneva accord were properly based for working out a settlement . All the powers have said this . Senator Fulbright called the Goldberg speech , which emphasized finding out if talks would  --  not could  --  follow stopping of bombing in Vietnam " worthwhile . " " I agree with what he said . But my impression is that they , the North Vietnamese , are not anxious to deal with us directly . " You ca n't bomb people as severely as we have without arousing bitterness and feeling . And you do n't make it easy to sit down and talk about peace under these circumstances . " The Senator was asked to detail his role in the Ashmore-Baggs peace-feeler incident . " I 've known Harry Ashmore a long time . For several years he was an editor of a newspaper in my state , in Little Rock . When he got back from Hanoi and came here , he gave me a ring , as he always does when he comes to Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me what he and Baggs had done , all about the trip to Hanoi . Letters at odds " I thought it might be wise if the President heard about it because word of such things does not always filter through to the President . I told them that I would like the President to hear the story first-hand . I told them this . " Then I talked to the President . " He did n't feel it was necessary to talk to them . He said that responsible men in the State Department would hear the complete story . And he said that he intended to satisfy me that the matter would be given full consideration . " He said that he would set up a meeting at the State Department in which . I would sit in . " That was on a Wednesday or Thursday . The meeting was the following Saturday , Feb. 4 , I believe . I sat in , and that was the only part I had in it ? being sure the President was made aware of it . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent to Ho Chi Minh ? Was it the same or the same vein as the on the administration sent to Ho four days later ? " I do n't feel they say the same things . " Did the second one cancel out the first , as Mr. Ashmore has charged ? " That 's what happened , was n't it ? " In your estimation , what should the State Department have done in the AshmoreBaggs case  --  with their so-called peace overture , that is ? " It seems to me in terms of what Mr. Bundy Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs William P. Bundy said ? he was present at the Feb. 4 meeting  --  there might have been a more candid and more courteous way to handle it . Such as : if Mr. Bundy had said to Mr. Ashmore , ' We appreciate all you are doing , but we have other channels . Perhaps we ought to drop your approach at the moment . ' " The second letter did cancel out the first , from Ashmore and Baggs . Ho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is not my opinion . That is what actually happened .
