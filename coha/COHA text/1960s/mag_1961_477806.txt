One of the few truly distinguished art critics of our time considers the thorniest of the controversies that harass the world of art ? the relation of the artist to his audience . ART is an extensive word . In this essay I limit it to the branch of art that I know best , the visual arts : and I take this term to cover everything made in response to the feeling that certain events or objects of contemplation , seen or imagined , are so important that they must be recorded ; and that certain objects of use are so important that they must be enriched . These two aspects of visual art I refer to as image and ornament . They used to be called " fine art " and " applied art , " and in the nineteenth century were severely distinguished from one another . Today we tend to minimize this distinction . We believe that the formcreating instinct can express itself in both ornament and image ; all ornament , however abstract , suggests some visual experience ; all images , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms of order . And both are sacramental . " What is this sacrament ? " as the catechism says . " The outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace . " Both image and ornament are revelations of a state of mind and social temper . Having accepted this basic unity , however , these two branches of visual art show very great differences , especially in their relationship to society , and I shall consider them separately . I think it true to say that all image art of any value has been made by , or on behalf of , a small minority : not necessarily a governing class in a political sense , but a governing class in an intellectual and spiritual sense . Since I shall often refer to this minority , I must decide what to call it . Plato 's " governors " is too narrow a term , Rousseau 's volonte gdnerale is too wide and too mysterious . For the sake of brevity I have referred to it as an elite ; although in fact it is not elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Images are not made for fun . In fact it is almost true to say that all image art of value illustrates or confirms a system of belief held by an elite , and very often is employed consciously as a means of maintaining that system . Obvious examples are the theocratic art of Egypt , the Parthenon with its Olympian embodiment of Greek philosophy , the stained glass of Chartres and Bourges illustrating not only Christian legend but the whole superstructure of patristic theology , the temples of Angkor and Borobudur , the Basilica of Assisi and its Buddhist equivalent Ajanta , the Stanze of Raphael , and so forth , down to David 's picture of the Oath of the Horatii . The list could be expanded till in the end it would include most of the greatest visible feats of human imagination and all of those which are in any way related to society and do not depend solely on the genius of an individual artist . It seems that an image achieves the concentration , clarity , and rhythmic energy which make it memorable only when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an important truth . The images provided for the majority by the elite may be more , or less , popular . Franciscan art in the thirteenth century and Baroque art in the seventeenth century were two attempts to create a new repertoire of images which should be more popular than that which preceded it . Both consciously exploited emotionalism . But the artists who gave the finest expression of those styles ? let us say Cimabue and Bernini ? were working for a small group of patrons , and were deeply receptive of their ideas . Bernini 's Saint Theresa became a popular image ; it revealed to the majority a hidden need . But it was Bernini 's own invention and in its origin it owed nothing to popular demands . Even the images which we first believe to have a popular origin ? for ex-75 ample those charming woodcuts known as images d ' Epinal ? are for the most part na ? ve and imperfect memories of images already invented for the elite by such an artist as Philippe de Champagne . The only exceptions I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , often with the help of balloons of text . Such were the illustrations of late antique manuscripts , the painting of popular artists like Pacino di Bonaguida , the Bihria Pauperum and its derivatives , and a number of Japanese scrolls , like the comic animals attributed to Toba Sojo . These , I believe , are the only forms of autoehthonous popular image art before the nineteenth century , and mention them now because they reveal a fundamental characteristic of all popular art : that it is concerned with narration . At first sight ornament would seem to be a more popular form of expression than image . Ornament has the character of a language ? nineteenth-century writers used , quite properly , to speak of the grammar of ornament ? and in so far as it is a living language it is accepted almost unconsciously by the majority . However there is this difference , that whereas language seems to have evolved unconsciously from mass needs , a system of ornament has seldom been invented by " the people . " In fact I can think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is outstandingly beautiful and does seem to be a genuine popular creation . In Europe good folk ornament turns out almost always to be a cruder rendering of a minority style ; and I think the same is true of China , India , Persia , and the whole Moslem culture . I would even extend this to the most vital anti expressive of all ornament styles ? that produced by the socalled folk-wandering peoples . I believe that the finest Scythian ornaments were by a great artist working for a chief , and that most of what has been discovered in Scandinavia or Scotland is a half-understood imitation of these aristocratic adornments . In ornament the ulterior motive is less strong than in the image . It does not openly recommend Sir Kenneth Clark , eminent art historian , was formerly Director of the National Gallery in London , Slade Professor of Fine Arts at Oxford , and Chairman of the Independent Television Authority of Great Britain . His books include " The Gothic Revival , " " Moments of Vision , " and " The Nude . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cooper Union Centennial in New York in late 1959 and the Lloyd ? Rnherts lecture given to the Royal College of Physicians.a system . But no one maintains that it exists solely to please the eye , and lacks ulterior motive altogether . It is an assertion of status ? whether in a cope or crown or crosier or portail royal or precious reliquary . This fact , which has been worked out in detail by Marxist historians , is taken by them as a condemnation of art ; and , as everyone knows , Veblen coined for it the expression " conspicuous waste . " This expression is apt , but I do not find it at all damaging . All art is waste in a material sense ; and the idea that things should be made more precious-looking in accordance with the status of the user seems to me entirely fitting . I think that a bishop should have finer vestments than a deacon and that the portal of a cathedral should he more richly ornamented than the door of a warehouse . 1 would go further , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only the result , but the cause of status . The carving on the corner capitals of the Doge 's Palace and the central window of the Palazzo Farnese confer a kind of kingship on those points of the buildings . In a democratic building , where all windows are equal , no ornament is permissible : although I understand that the higher executives may have more windows . THE FIRST AND SECOND LAWS S 0 I would deduce from history this first law ( in the Ruskinian sense ) of the relationship of art and society : that visual art , whether it takes the form of images or ornament , is made by a minority for a minority , and would add this rider , that the image-making part is usually controlled in the interests of a system , and that the ornamental part is usually the index of status . Created by a minority : yes , but accepted by the majority unquestionably , eagerly , and with a sense of participation . The degree of physical participation in the great popular works of art is hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gothic cathedrals ? Chartres is the most familiar example ? whole villages moved to be nearer the work , and men were prepared to learn subsidiary crafts in order to help the professional masons . We can assume that the same was true of Borobudur or Ellora , although the economic status of the workers may have been different . A parallel in modern life would he the building of a great liner in Clydebank , where the whole life of the town depends on the work . But apart from this active participation , one has only to read the accounts of how in the great ages of artistic creation works of art were brought into existence ? the long and serious thought which preceded the commission , the public anxiety about its progress , the joy when it was at last accomplished , and the procession in which it was carried to its destination , to the sound of bells and singing of a Te Dcum ? one has only to come upon such documents , common enough in the Middle Ages and Renaissance , and applicable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recognize that the society of those times needed art , believed without question in the value of art , and participated imaginatively in its making . So this would be my second law : that a healthy and vital relationship between art and society exists when the majority feel that art is absolutely necessary to them , to confirm their beliefs , to inform them about matters of lasting importance , and to make the invisible visible . Now in saying that this is the healthiest relationship between art and society , I must not be understood as saying that these are the only circumstances under which good works of art can he produced . Even before 1870 great pictures were painted by individuals who had no relationship with society at all and whose work was distasteful or incomprehensible to the majority . Rembrandt and Turner , in their later phases , are obvious examples . In the history of art , as in all history , nothing poses a more delicate problem of interpretation than the relationship between individual genius and the general will . But even if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiration is more likely to illuminate an individual than a mass and that all the memorable forms of art were originally invented by individuals of genius , .. we must agree that at certain periods these individuals are isolated , at others they enlist behind them a whole army of assent and participation . Nor is this direct relationship of need and unquestioning belief certain to produce good art . artistic faculties are somewhat unequally ? we may think unfairly ? distributed among the peoples of the globe ; and although the relationship may be sound , not all needs have the same validity . However , I am sufficiently a Ruskinian to believe that when a society , over a long period , produces an art which is lacking in vitality and imaginative power , but which nevertheless seems to be accepted by the majority , there is something wrong with that society . This brings me back to the part of my opening definition , where I said that art was a sacrament ; and I must now consider how an inward and spiritual grace can he given outward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A symbolis a sort of analogy in the physical sphere for some spiritual or intellectual experience . Usually it is the concentration of several related experiences so complex that they can not be expressed in any rational form , and so intense that a physical symbol suggests itself unconsciously . We know from the saints of every religion that the most poignant spiritual experiences demand expression by physical analogies , and , in spite of Pascal and Spinoza , we may infer that spiritual experiences which remain abstract are not usually very intense . Symbols may start as a result of private revelations , but their value in art depends on the degree to which they can be felt and accepted by others . In fact nearly all intensely felt symbols have some universal quality , which makes them comprehensible even when their maker believes them to be peculiar to himself . But it is also true that the sacramental character of art is far more easily achieved when the principal objects of belief have already been given a symbolic form which is generally recognized and accepted : in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WHY AN EMPTY CHAIR WILL NOT 1/0 I N THIS question of art and society the importance of an accepted iconography can not be overstated . Without it the network of beliefs and customs which holds a society together may never take shape as art . If an iconography contains a number of sufficiently powerful symbols , it can positively alter a philosophic system . The points of dogma for which no satisfactory image can be created tend to be dropped from popular religious exposition , and episodes which have scarcely occupied the attention of theologians tend to grow in importance if they produce a compelling image . I would go so Ear as to say that the failure to discover a satisfactory symbol for the Holy Ghost has seriously impaired our concept of the Trinity . Let me give an example of iconographic triumph and disaster from one painter in one place : Titian in Venice . In the Frari his sublime image of the Assumption of the Virgin is so corporeally convincing that it provided a point of departure for Baroque painting , and this image was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own day . In the " Salute " is Titian 's painting of Pentecost , a work over which he took great pains , but without success . It was the final blow to a subject which had never found an impressive iconographical form , and which in spite of its theological importance , gradually faded from the consciousness of popular Catholicism . I.et me take another example from Buddhism . It had been categorically laid clown that the Buddha must not be portrayed , and in the earliest scenes of his Life , such as those on the stupa at Sanchi , the central point of each episode is left a blank ? an empty chair or a deserted boat . This insult to the image-making faculty was not to be borne , and a representation of the Buddha was finally accepted . But where did it come from ? From the imitation , in the fringes of the Buddhist world , of some Praxitelian Apollo . Thus the most extreme example of spirituality was embodied by the most concrete expression of physical beauty . Conversely , dogma may triumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and produce an iconography , like that of later Buddhism , with its 10,000 Buddhas , which deprives images of all artistic quality . Lest it should be thought that this question of iconography does not apply to modern life , let me add that it is not confined to dogmatic religion . For example , the iconography of the Romantic Movement from 1790 to 1830 was almost as compulsive as if it had been laid down by the Council of Trent , The tiger ? in Blake , Stubbs , Gericaull , Delacroix , Barye , and a dozen lesser artists ; the cloud ? in Wordsworth and Byron , Shelley , Turner , and Constable ; the shipwreck ? in Byron , Turner , Goya , Gericault , Delacroix , and Victor Hugo : these are symbols of Romanticism , used and accepted unconsciously because they expressed the new worship of nature and power , and a new sense of destiny . I think it would be a mistake to call this state of mind a religion . That word should be reserved for beliefs which are based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observances . But at least we can say that the belief in nature , which expressed itself in the landscape painting of the nineteenth century and has remained the most productive source of popular art to this day , is a non-material belief . It is something which can not be justified by reason alone and seems to lift the life of the senses onto a higher plane . This suggests another " law " in the relationship of art and society : that it is valuable only when the spiritual life is strong enough to insist on some sort of expression through symbols . No great social arts can be based on material values or physical sensations alone . This " law " leads me to consider the problem of luxury art . Now , it would be dishonest for me to take a puritanical or Veblenist view of luxury VOYAGE SAMUEL MENASHE Water opens without end At the prow of a ship Rising to descend Away from it Days become one I am who I was art . Moreover there is a point ? Watteau 's " Enseigne de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of luxury art is so fine that it offers a spiritual experience . We are playing with words and concepts which , as we breathe on them , become alive and flutter from our hands . Still , the fact remains that , in the Long run , luxury art implies the reverse of what I have called a healthy relationship between art and society and so has a deadening effect . The most obvious example is the art of eighteenthcentury France , where , however , the arrogant elaboration demanded by powerful patrons is sometimes sweetened , and given lasting value , by a reasonable belief in the douceur de vivre . Rut the predominance of luxury art in the eighteenth century is a short and harmless episode compared to that long slumber of the creative imagination which lasted from the end of the second century B.C. to the third century A.D. For almost five hundred years not a single new form of any value was invented except , perhaps , in architecture . Works from the preceding centuries were reproduced interminably ? made smoother and sweeter for private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can we say of the relations of this art to the society which produced and accepted it ? That no one believed in its symbols ; that no one looked to it for confirmation or enlightenment . In short that no one wanted it , except as a conventional form of display . The Romans did not want art and they did not make it ; but they collected it . The problem of luxury art is complicated by the act that the periods in which it predominates are usually periods when the art of the past is collected and esteemed . This was obviously the case in Hellenized Rome and in eighteenth-century England ; conversely the idea of collecting and displaying works of an earlier period was hardly known in those cultures where the need for art was strong and widely diffused . One must distinguish , of course , between the fruitful use by artists of earlier works , which took place in thirteenth-century Rheims no less than in fifteenth-century Florence , and the competitive accumulation of collectors . The feeling for the art of the past in DonateBo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connoisseurs ? at once more passionate and more practical . " How can I use these admirable inventions to give my own message ? " " How can I surpass them in truth or expressive power ? " These are the questions aroused by the work of the past in the great ages of art . In periods of luxury art , on the other hand , works of the past are collected at worst for reasons of prestige and at best in order to establish a standard of taste . The concept of good taste is the virtuous profession of luxury art . Rut one can not imagine it existing in the twelfth century , or even in the Renaissance ; and without going into the complex question of what the words can mean , 1 am inclined to doubt if a completely healthy relationship between art and society is possible while the concept of good taste exists . WHAT COUNTS IS THE COUNT S If C H , then , are the deductions that I would make from studying the history of art ; and I have ventured , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is arguable that this word should never be applied to the historical process : we see too little . But at least we can say that these are strong probabilities which should he our first criteria when we conic to examine the relations of art to society at the present day . In doing so I may be allowed one assumption : that Fundamentally human beings have not changed . The picture of human nature which we derive from the Book of Kings or the Fourth Dynasty Egyptian portrait heads in Cairo and Boston is much the same as what we know today , and I think we may safely assume that it will take more than television and the internal combustion engine to change us . In fact , I would suppose that we have more in common with the Middle Ages than our fathers had , because to us universal destruction is an actual possibility , whereas to our fathers it was only a pious fiction . However , if human nature has not changed . human society has ; and changed as the result of a basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one word : materialism . The word has taken on a pejoraLive sense , but materialism has been the source of achievements which have added immeasurably to the well-being and happiness of mankind . Whether as the dialectical materialism of the East or the liberal materialism of the West , it has given to masses of men a new standard of living , a new sense of status , and a new hope . These benefits have been achieved because materialism has been the philosophical basis of two outstanding human activities , one in the moral and one in the intellectual sphere : humanitarianism and science . These are the integrating forces of our culture , and they are as powerful , and as all-pervasive , as was Christianity in the Middle Ages . Now , how does this underlying philosophy of materialism relate to art ? One can not help being aware of one very serious obstacle . Materialism and all its children are dedicated to measurement . Bentham 's philosophy was based on the greatest good for the greatest number . Democracy depends on counting the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Science , although it claims to have outgrown that phase , reached its present position by an unprecedented accuracy of measurement . In its century of triumph , measurement has even become an article of faith . The potential of faith in the human mind is probably fairly constant , but it attaches itself to different ideas or manifestations at different periods . The bones of the Saints , the Rights of Man , psychoanalysis ? all these have been the means of precipitating a quantity of faith which is always in solution . People probably believe as much nonsense today as they did in the Middle Ages ; but we demand of our precipitant that it look as if it could he proved ? that it appear to be measurable . People might have believed in art during the last fifty years if its effects could have been stated in an immense table of figures or a very complicated graph ; of course they would not have checked the figures or understood the graph , but the existence of these symbols of measurement would have sustained their faith . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derive from a song . We can not even measure the relative greatness of artists , and attempts to do so by giving marks , popular in the eighteenth century , produced ridiculous results ; Giulio Romano always came out top of the poll , which as we all know , by some unanalyzable form of knowledge , is incorrect . The more honest philosophers of materialism have recognized that art can not he measured in material terms . Bentham invented the unforgettable comparison between pushpin and poetry , coming down on the side of pushpin because more people wanted it . Poetry he defined as " misrepresentation , " which is the liberal counterpart to Veblen 's " conspicuous waste . " The philosophers of dialectical materialism have accepted art only in so far as its magical properties have conceded the right to enjoy and even to produce art among the rights of minorities . Art is the opiate of the few . How are the philosophic assumptions of materialism reflected in the actual status of art in modern society ? It is incontrovertible that fine art , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very small minority . We must not be bamboozled by the claim that more people listen to " good " music or visit picture galleries ; nor even by the fact that a few of us have tricked the unsuspecting viewer into looking at old pictures on television . Similar claims could be made for the nineteenth century ? for example , during the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition in 1857 , special trains ran from all over England . and whole factories closed down in order that the workers could enjoy the experience of art ; and yet the next fifty years saw the consolidation of a Philistinism unequaled since the Roman Republic . Anyone who has been concerned with those " arts " which really depend on the support of a majority ? the cinema , television , or wholesale furnishing ? knows that the minority which is interested in art is so small as to be irrelevant in any serious calculation . In England , the majority is not merely apathetic , but hostile to art . A recent example was the film of The Horse 's Mouth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant acting and hilarious comedy ) simply because the leading character was an artist . If only , they said , he had been a schoolmaster or a doctor ! This is perfectly understandable . The existence of these freakish members of society whose usefulness can not be demonstrated , but who often seem to be enjoying themselves and sometimes even to be making money , is an affront to the ordinary hard-working man . It is fair to say that in spite of this feeling , artists are treated tolerantly in democratic countries . We should be grateful for this tolerance , but does it not fall far short of my second condition for a healthy relationship between art and society : that the majority feel art to be absolutely necessary to them ; that they are not merely consumers , but participants ; and that they receive works of art as the expression of their own deepest feelings ? Before answering this question , I must look back at my original definition of the word " art . " Do the majority still feel that material things must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images are so important that they must be preserved ? In a sense the answer is " yes . " The majority still want ornament on their clothes , their furnishing fabrics , their wallpapers , and many objects of daily use . More than this , they still mind very much how things look , independent of their utility . Whether it be dress or automobile design , they are still in the grip of style . They and the designers arc swept along by a blind destiny , a mysterious force which they can not analyze , but of which they are acutely conscious when they look back at the fashions of twenty years ago . A NECESSARY PURGE B U T no one pretends that , in the last fifty years , the use of ornament has revealed a satisfactory relationship between art and society . Ruskin and William Morris supposed that this was due to the intervention of the machine . But this theory turns out to he applicable only to the Gothic style . In almost every other style the machine is an extended tool that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal of the ornament of the past , from the Viking goldsmith work of Sutton Hoo to the inlaid panels of the Taj Mahal , is entirely devoid of manual sensibility and might just as well have been made by a machine . From a technical point of view , the premises on which ornamental art is produced have not greatly changed . When we examine it in the light of my other laws , however , the change is considerable . With a single exception , the ornament favored by the majority is no longer made for an elite ; and it no longer has any underlying sense of symbolic meaning . In one branch of art ? in architecture ? it has almost ceased to exist ; and although we have now grown used to buildings without ornament , the historian must record that this is a unique event in the history of art , and one which would certainly have shocked those famous architects of the past who gave so much thought to the character of their ornament , and counted upon it at all points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architecture was perhaps a necessary purge and had certain health-giving consequences . But often it is simply an impoverishment , an excuse for meanness and a triumph for the spirit that denies . That it is not the expression of a popular will we learn when we look down the blank face of a modern building into the shop windows at its base ; and this leads me to the exception I mentioned just now : it is women 's dress . There , it seems to me , the compulsion is so strong that a healthy relationship between art and society is never lost . I am not suggesting that all fashions are equally good ? of course there are moments of failing invention and false direction . But they always right themselves because there is an indestructible volonti genera le ? aninteraction between the elite and the masses , a sense of status and an unconscious feeling for symbolism . If the position of ornament in modern society is uneasy and incomplete , the position of image art has suffered a far more drastic change , owing to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and credible images has in no way declined , but it is satisfied every day by illustrated papers ; and the love of landscape which , as I said , was one of the chief spiritual conquests of the nineteenth century , is fed by colored postcards . I am not denying that there is an element of art in press photography ; I will also admit that I derive a pleasure from colored postcards which must , I suppose , be called aesthetic . I prefer a good colored postcard to a bad landscape painting . But in both these projections of the image , much of what we believe gives art its value is necessarily omitted . There is selection , but no order , and no extension of the imaginative faculty . To realize how destructive has been the effect of the camera on image art , consider the art of portraiture . The desire to hand down one 's likeness to posterity produced one of the chief social arts of the postmedieval world . It did so because the portrait painters of the time had behind them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sitters participated because they knew that their desire to perpetuate their likenesses could not be achieved in any other way . Now , no one supposes that a photograph , however skillful , is comparable with a Goya as a work of art , or even as a likeness . But the fact that photography exists , and can tell us far more accurately than a mediocre painting what people looked like , has knocked away the foundation upon which portraiture rested . There is no longer a feeling of participation in the sitters . The portrait painter no longer feels that he is really needed , any more than ornament is needed on a building ; and so he , too , has become an anachronism . The portrait is typical of the decline of confidence in art which is felt unconsciously by the mass of people as a result of the camera . Thereis however one form of popular imagery which is not entirely dependent on photography , and that is the poster . Here , a number of my conditions for a healthy relationship between art and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minority and aim at supporting some belief ; they appeal to a majority , and millions of people derive from them what they take to be information about matters which they believe to be important . Moreover , posters achieve their effects through the use of symbols , and it is a curious fact that the ordinary man will accept in posters a symbolic treatment , a freedom from realism , which he would not accept in a picture framed in a gallery , simply because a poster does not exist for its own sake , but is concerned with something he needs . All this is true , and yet we know that in spite of many effective and memorable posters , advertising has not produced an art comparable to the windows of Chartres Cathedral ; and never can . The reason is , of course , that it lacks what I have called the sacramental element in art . I said earlier that the nearest equivalent in modern life to the building of a medieval cathedral was the construction of a giant liner . But the liner is built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cathedral was built to the glory of God . One might add that advertising art is concerned with lies , of a relatively harmless and acceptable kind ; but one must remember that the great art of the past was also concerned with lies , often of a much more dangerous kind . The difference is not one of truth , but of the different realms to which these two forms of art belong ? the realm of matter and the realm of spirit . CAPTURE YOUR BIRD ALIVE I NEED not press any further the point that the philosophy of materialism is hostile to art . But what about its two noble kinsmen , humanitarianism and science ? Although they are to a great extent committed to measurement , they are not wholly materialistic . They recognize values which we may call moral , intellectual , and even aesthetic . They are the integrating beliefs of the last 150 years . How are they connected with art ? The more enlightened supporters of humanitarianism have often bewailed the fact that art seems to have flourished in societies which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinctively that this is natural ; that kindness , mildness , decency , are not as likely to produce art as violence , passion , and ruthlessness . One of BY KENNETH CLARK SI the most ancient and persistent images in art is the lion devouring a horse or deer ; and it must puzzle the humanitarian mind that this bloodthirsty episode came to be accepted as a suitable decoration for pagan sarcophagi ; then entered Christian iconography as a symbol of the spiritual life ; and finally became the dominating motif of the only great religious painter of the nineteenth century , Delacroix . The answer is given in Blake 's Marriage of Heaven and Hell , and I will not be so foolish as to elaborate it . But I may quote the words of a great living painter : " It is n't enough to have the eyes of a gazelle ; you also need the claws of a cat in order to capture your bird alive and play with it before you eat it and so join its life to yours . " To put it less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which must devour and transform all that is passive and phlegmatic in life , and no amount of good will can take the place of this creative hunger . I am not saying that violence and brutality beget art , or that there is not still far too much violence and brutality left in the world . The bright new towns in our welfare state are an achievement of which humanity may be proud . But do not let us suppose that this peaceful , humdrum , hell-free , de-Christianized life has been achieved without loss . And apart from the unlikeliness of art being forged at such a low temperature , the doctrine of equality and the drift toward equality , on which such a society depends , run counter to one of my first laws . We have many reliable indications of what Mr. and Mrs. Honest Everyman really want . We do n't need surveys and questionnaires ? only a glance at suburban or provincial furniture stores and television advertisements . There we see the art of a prosperous democracy ? the art that is easily unwrapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter much , were it not that Gresham 's law ? that bad money drives out good ? is equally true of spiritual currency ; and we are all surrounded by far more bad art than we are aware of . I observed during the war , when the amount of conspicuous waste was cut down in the interest of economy , and objects of daily use , like teacups , were made without even a curve , let alone a pattern , that the appetite for real works of art was much keener and more discriminating than it was before . With science the position is rather different . It is not so much a soil in which art will not grow as it is a rival crop . The development of physical science in the last hundred years has been one of the most colossal efforts the humanintellect has ever made . Now , I think it is arguable that human beings can produce , in a given epoch , only a certain amount of creative power , and that this is directed to different ends at different times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the last seventy years have deflected many of those skills and endowments which go to the making of a work of art . To begin with , there is the sheer energy . In every molding of a Florentine palace we are conscious of an immense intellectual energy , and it is the absence of this energy in the nineteenthcentury copies of Renaissance buildings which makes them seem so dead . To find a form with the same vitality as the window moldings of the Palazzo Strozzi , I must wait till I get back into an airplane , and look at the relation of the engine to the wing . That form is alive , not ( as used to be said ) because it is functional ? many functional shapes are entirely uninteresting ? but because it is animated by the breath of modern science . WARM BLOOD IN SCIENCE T H E deflections from art to science are the more serious because these are not , as used to be supposed , two contrary activities , but draw on many of the same capacities of the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination . Artist and scientist alike are trying to give concrete form to dimly apprehended ideas . Both , in the words of Aristotle 's famous definition of poetry , are hoping " to see similars in dissimilars . " " All science , " says Dr. Bronowski , " is the search for unity in hidden likenesses , and the starting point is an image , because then the unity is before our mind 's eye . " He gives the example of how Copernicus ' notion of the solar system was inspired by the old astrological image of man with the signs of the Zodiac distributed about his body , and notices how Copernicus uses warmblooded expressions to describe the chilly operations of outer space . " The earth conceives from the sun " or " The sun rules a family of stars . " Our scientists are no longer as anthropomorphic as that : but they still depend on humanly comprehensible images , and the valid symbols of our time , invented to embody some scientific truth , have taken root in the popular imagination . Do those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of atomic structure ? I am too ignorant to say , but I accept the symbol just as an early Christian accepted the Fish or the Lamb , and I find it echoed or even ( it would seem ) anticipaced in the work of modern artists like Kandinsky and Mir6 . Finally there is the question of popular interest and approval . The position of science in the modern world illustrates clearly what I meant by a vita/ relationship with society . Science is front-page news ; every child has a scientific toy ; small boys dream of space ships ; big boys know how to make a radio set . What does a compulsory visit to an art museum mean compared to this ? An opportunity to fool about and hide behind the showcases ? And , at the other end of the scale , the research scientist has universities competing for his favors with millions of dollars ' worth of plant and equipment , while principalities and powers wait breathless for his conclusions . So he goes to work , as Titian once did , confident that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . ELITE OR PRIESTHOOD ? U C H are the conclusions which force them- selves upon me when I examine , in the light of history , the present relations of art and society . Those who care for art and feel a sense of loyalty to their own times may feel it their duty to refute these conclusions , but I think they will find it difficult to do so without straining the evidence . Does this mean that a broadly based social art is unlikely to appear for a long time ? I am inclined to think so . This is not as catastrophic as it sounds . At least 90 per cent of our fellow countrymen get on very well without art , and I do n't quite know why we should bother about them or try to persuade them to take an interest . No one tries to persuade me to take an interest in racing . And yet some instinct I can neither define nor defend makes me believe that people without art are incomplete and that posterity will have a poor opinion of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have described . This is what I find . The fact that art is not only tolerated , but actually supported by government and municipal funds , although it is hardly worth a single vote and practically no politician has the faintest belief or interest in it , shows that it has retained some of its magic power . The unbelieving majority still recognize that the believing minority , in picture galleries and concert halls , achieve a state of mind of peculiar value . There are very few people who have never had an aesthetic experience , either from the sound of a band or the sight of a sunset or the action of a horse . The words " beauty " and " beautiful " of ten pass the lips of those who have never looked at a work of art ? oftener , perhaps . than they pass the lips of museum curators ? and some meaning must be attached to them . I believe that the majority of people really long to experience that moment of pure , disinterested , nonmaterial satisfaction which causes them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience can be obtained more reliably through works of art than through any other means , I believe that those of us who try to make works of art more accessible are not wasting our time . But how little we know of what we are doing . I am not even sure that museum art and its modern derivatives , however extended and skillfully contrived , will ever bring about a healthy relationship between art and society . It is too deeply rooted in cultural values which only a small minority can acquire . Here we reach the crux of the problem : the nature of the elite . It was my first conclusion that art can not exist without one , my second that the elite must inspire confidence in the majority . During the last hundred years values in art have been established by a minority so small and so cut off from the sources of life , that it can not be called an elite in my sense of the word . Let us call it a priesthood , and add that in preserving its mysteries from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather too mysterious . There is something admirable in all forms of bigotry , but I do not believe that we can return to a healthy relationship between art and society over so narrow a bridge . On the contrary , I believe that our hope lies in an expanding elite , an elite drawn from every class , and with varying degrees of education , but united in a belief that nonmaterial values can be discovered in visible things . Is it fatuous to interpret the large sale of books on art and the relative success of certain television programs as a sign that such an elite is forming ? But even if these are genuine snowdrops , and not paper flowers stuck in the woods by hopeful highbrows , many obstacles will remain . There is a lack of an iconography . There is the glut of false art which blunts our appetites . There is even the danger that true art may be degraded through the media of mass communications . But I believe that all these obstacles can be overcome if only the need for art , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , yet is manifested by him unconsciously every day , can be united with the will to art which must remain the endowment , and the responsibility , of the happy few .
