MORALS <P> ( See Cover ) <P> The Orgone Box is a half-forgotten invention of the late Dr. Wilhelm Reich , one of Sigmund Freud 's more brilliant disciples , who in his middle years turned into an almost classic specimen of the mad scientist . The device was supposed to gather , in physical form , that life force which Freud called libido and which Reich called orgone , a coinage derived from " orgasm . " The narrow box , simply constructed of wood and lined with sheet metal , offered cures for almost all the ills of civilization and of the body ; it was also widely believed to act , for the person sitting inside it , as a powerful sex stimulant . Hundreds of people hopefully bought it before the U.S. Government declared the device a fraud in 1954 and jailed its inventor . And yet , in a special sense , Dr. Reich may have been a prophet . For now it sometimes seems that all America is one big Orgone Box . <P> With today 's model , it is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Improved and enlarged to encompass the continent , the big machine works on its subjects continuously , day and night . From innumerable screens and stages , posters and pages , it flashes the larger-than-life-sized images of sex . From countless racks and shelves , it pushes the books which a few years ago were considered pornography . From myriad loudspeakers , it broadcasts the words and rhythms of pop-music erotica . And constantly , over the intellectual Muzak , comes the message that sex will save you and libido make you free . <P> The U.S. is still a long way from the rugged debaucheries of Restoration England or the perfumed corruption of the Gallant Century in France . But Greeks who have grown up with the memory of Aphrodite can only gape at the American goddesses , silken and seminude , in a million advertisements . Indians who have seen the temple sculptures of Konarak can only marvel at some of the illustrated matter sold in American drugstores ; and Frenchmen who consider themselves the world 's arbiters on the subject , can only smile at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be undergoing a revolution of mores and an erosion of morals that is turning it into what Reich called a " sex-affirming culture . " <P> Two Generations . Men with memories ask , " What , again ? " The first sexual revolution followed World War I , when flaming youth buried the Victorian era and anointed itself as the Jazz Age . In many ways it was an innocent revolution . In This Side of Paradise , F. Scott Fitzgerald alarmed mothers by telling them " how casually their daughters were accustomed to being kissed " ; today mothers thank their stars if kissing is all their daughters are accustomed to . It was , nevertheless , a revolution that took nerve , and it was led by the daring few ; today 's is far more broadly based . In the 1920s , to praise sexual freedom was still outrageous ; today sex is simply no longer shocking , in life or literature . <P> The difference between the ' 20s and ' 60s comes down , in part , to a difference between people .
