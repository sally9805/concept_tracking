Notes and Comment OUR uptown insomniac friend has sent us some more of his night thoughts , which go as follows : " God knows , I am accustomed up here at Ninety-eighth and Fifth to winter winds that unconscionably flatten mothers and children , doormen , delivery boys , museum-hound old ladies , and other intrepid types . But I doubt if I could stomach another three-day wind like the one that hounded the Northeast at the turn of the year . That remains in my memory as a unique and fearful wind , for it was  --  hereabouts , anyway almost completely invisible . It carried no snow , rain , hail , or sleet . It was accompanied much of the time by brassy , poker-faced sunshine . And , though invisible , it was loud and brutally cold  --  like a huge ghost . Its sixty-mile-per-hour gusts were n't after houses and trees ; they were after souls . If I sound agitated , it 's because I was vacationing alone in a small old house in Head of the Harbor , Long Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me by surprise . I had n't bought a paper for a couple of days ( Newsday and the Long Island Daily Press have the same unmistakable transparency as Boston papers ) , the house has no television , and the radio reception is poor . Besides , the first day of the blow came up clear , cold , and brisk  --  an ideal winter day . Around lunchtime , though , there was a sudden upstairs crash , followed by an irregular thurnrnbb thumnibb-thummlib thumnibb . Racing upstairs , I was met by a torrent of icy air . A porch door had blown open and was flailing against a wall . The door had no lock , so I barricaded it with a heavy armchair and a six-foot split-log bench . The wind rose steadily , but the sun was bright , and around two o'clock , as is my custom , I took a short nap . At two-forty-five , while I was having a cup of tea in the kitchen , the radio , static and all , died . I turned on the kitchen light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living-room lamps nothing . The power , which meant the furnace , too , had failed . The thermometer outside the kitchen window read six above . Well , the power will be restored soon , I thought , and sat down to finish my tea . At three-fifteen , I tried the radio and the lights . No soap . Visions of frozen pipes exploding by candlelight filled any head , and after making a quick , fruitless inspection outside for fallen wires I called the Long Island Lighting Company . A polite , corporate-sounding voice informed me they were swamped by calls but would do what they could . At three-thirty , there was a heavy knock on the front door , and a burly , cheerful-looking policeman came in and introduced himself as Chief Edward J. Moroncy , of the Head of the Harbor police . ( The force , I learned later , totals two . ) ' Your lights out ? ' he asked me . I nodded . ' Stanley 's , too , next door , but they got power on your other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill past Stanley 's , see what she 's got . ' The Chief dialled a number on the kitchen phone . ' Mizz Lawrence ? The Chief . You got electric up there ? Yeh- Yeh-mm . O.K. ' He hung up . ' Looks like it 's just you and Stanley . I 'll call the Long Bland Lighting . ' He left , and the phone rang . It was Stanley . He 'd spotted a small loose wire at the top of a telephone pole between our houses . Pole No. 22 , he said . He also said that the water pump for our houses was out and that the pressure would be gone in half an hour . I told him I 'd call the Lighting Company again . A different but equally polite corporate voice said they were swamped by calls but would do what they could . It was four o'clock , and the wind had reached a persistent roar . Sunlight , weakened by the woods west of the house , wavered on the kitchen wall . The temperature in the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the living room , where I could see my breath ; turned on the gas oven in the kitchen ; and put on a windbreaker . In the next half hour , the upstairs door blew open twice , shoving the chair and the bench six feet across a rug each time , and two windowpanes shattered . I called Lighting again . Then I drove to Stony Brook for some candles . When I got back , it was dark . The front-hall thermometer was at fifty , and the living room was near freezing , fire or no fire . It was four degrees outside the kitchen . I lit half a dozen candles and turned up the oven , closing off everything but the dining room . For the moment , there in the kitchen , I was warm , and even snug . Then the house trembled , like a dreaming dog , and the wind took on a  --  well , massive sound . As I started dialling the Lighting people again , a small truck pulled up in front of the telephone pole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head in a sweater , clamped a hat un top , and went out . The wind was deafening and the cold excruciating . I had a jumbled impression of air turned to blowing blocks of ice , of Dante 's Inferno , and of creaking , thrashing , agonized trees . The scene at the telephone pole was heroic . The repairman  --  enormous , muffled , helmeted  --  had turned on a powerful floodlight , raised an extension ladder to the top of the pole , and clambered up , and he and the ladder and a dozen tree limbs were performing a slow , wild , dangerous dance . After five minutes , I could stand the cold no longer and ran woodenly hack to the house . I slammed the front door and stumbled across the hall and into the dining room , and  --  bang ! ? the lights went on . I laughed , then cheered . The hall thermometer had reached forty , and it was only five-fifteen . " It blew for two more days , of course , hut everything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my empty car blowing slowly and spookily down my driveway the next night , a nose , vengeful , whanging gutter , and wind , wind , wind , wind was anti-climactic . It is late and time to close . I have been back in town for three luxurious days . Despite the noise and brutality and dirt and madness of the city , we are pretty coddled here . Good night . " Kandinsky SOME rolling stones do , too , gather moss . Vasilv Kandinsky , who had painted something like fifteen hundred oils and water colors when he died in Paris at seventy-eight , was horn in Moscow in 1866 ; went abroad with his family at three and attended nursery school in Florence ; moved to Odessa at five ; entered the University of Moscow at twenty ; at twenty-three , accompanied an anthropological expedition to the Vologda District , in northwestern Russia , and then visited St. Petersburg and Paris ; was back in Moscow three years later for his law examination , and his first marriage ; then revisited Paris and returned to Moscow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty , abandoned his law career in order to paint , and settled ( for a while ) in Munich ; visited Holland , Venice , Odessa , and Moscow at thirty-seven ; went to Tunisia a year or so later ; divided the next three years among Odessa , Paris , Rapallo , Switzerland , and Berlin ; returned to Munich at forty-two ; moved to Murnau , in southern Germany , at forty-three ; revisited Russia at forty-four ; backtracked to Germany and , after excursions to Zurich and Russia , went to Sweden for the winter when he was forty-nine ; returned to Moscow the next year , married his second wife , and stayed until he was fifty-five ; resettled in Germany , to become a teacher at the Bauhaus , and remained for eleven years ; and , at sixtyseven , when the Nazis closed the Bauhaus , moved to Paris , where , after side trips to the C6te d'Azur , Normandy , and the Pyrenees , he died in 1944 . The chief depositaries , or depositories , of his work are his widow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miinter Foundation , at the Stadtische Galerie in Munich ; and the Guggenheim Museum , whose first director , Baroness Hilla Rehay , was a great Kandinsky fan , and which is about to open the world 's first comprehensive Kandinsky show . We 've had a pre-installation visit with the Museum 's director , Mr. Thomas M. Messer , who has been rounding up the exhibit for the past two years . " It 's been a most ambitious undertaking  --  diplomatically , organizationally  --  in selecting the pictures and in publishing the catalogues , " he said after giving us a rundown on the foregoing itinerary . " We 're showing ninety-six oils and thirty-five water colors , which , after April , will travel to the Musee National d'Art Moderne in Paris , the Municipal Museum in The Hague , and the Kunst-balk in Base , and we 've organized a second show , of sixty-five oils and thirty-one water colors , which will be shown in ten American institutions , starting with the Pasadena Art Museum and ending with the Worcester-Art Museum . Both shows will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kandinsky in Germany , and Kandinsky in France . He was at one time or another a citizen of each of these countries . We 've gathered the exhibits from our own collection of nearly two hundred Kandinsky works and frorn the equally important collections formed , or inherited , by his friend Gabriele Winter and by his wife  --  the Miinter collection is strong in early Kandinskys , and Mme. Kandinsky 's collection is strong in later Kandinskys  --  and we 've obtained , through channels , seven Kandinskys from Russia ; they 're owned by The Hermitage , in Leningrad , and the Tretyakov Gallery and the Municipal Museum in Moscow . This is the first time such a door has been opened , and we hope it may set a fruitful precedent . Mme. Kandinsky , who is coming here for the opening , is a Russian lady , now living in Paris , who is persona grata in the Soviet Union ; it was she who estahfished the initial contact there , with the Russian authorities , that made the loan possible . Her husband was active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizing twenty-two museums in Russia and founding the Academy of Arts , of which he was vice-president . It was only in 1921 , when he decided that his contribution to art could be made most effectively in the ' Vest , that he left to join the Bauhaus , " We asked Mr. Messer to give us a lecture on Kandinsky , and he obligingly complied . " His most decisive contributions were made between 1909 and 1913 , " he said . " Our show starts with 1902 , when he was doing poetic representations ; around 1908 distortion begins and shapes are attenuated , until by 1910 you are on the borderline of abstraction . Around 1913 , pure forms come to the fore , and color and form assert their independence , and this free form continues until 1920 . During the Bauhaus period , we become aware of a certain tightening , which creates a geometric vocabulary . In the late Paris period , the styles combine ; he is going back to a freer form , with control attained through geometry . To put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representation to art expressing itself in non-objective form ; went on to another transformation , from his organic period to one of geometric forms , in which the free form was harnessed and disciplined ; and , finally , put all these things together , achieving a synthesis in which he even recalled representational associations . It 's really an anthology of the modern movement . Kandinsky was an innovator of the greatest significance ; he was among the first painters to deploy non-representational forms for pictorial ends . We 're showing his work chronologically . We 'll shoot people up to the fifth floor and let them descend the ramps through forty years of Kandinsky 's evolution . The Guggenheim Museum is ideal for this kind of show ; the continuity is indicated in the spiral architecture . I think it would be too much to claim that this is what Frank Lloyd Wright had in mind , but it works out beautifully . " ? INCIDENTAL INTELLIGENCE : One of the " fun activities " that are advertised by the Holland-America Line is " Religious Services . " Founders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but illustrious men and institutions , bent on being venerable , occasionally err in the opposite direction . A few years ago , Mr. P. G. Wodehouse celebrated a purported eightieth birthday , with a round of interviews , during the October in which he in fact became seventy-nine , and last month The Players similarly jumped the gun by a twelvemonth , inviting members and guests to a Founders ' Night celebration with a card that read , resoundingly , " Seventy-five years ago this New Year 's Eve Edwin Booth stood before the fireplace in the Great Hall and read the Deed of Gift to the assembled Founders , and thereby established our club , The Players ! " Actually , it was on the night of December 31 , 1888 , that Mr. Booth turned over the fine house he had bought on Gramercy Park to the members of the club he had dreamed up . Adding to the confusion ( and , conceivably , accounting for the statistical error ) was a decision to hold Founders ' Night , traditionally a stag affair , several nights after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deference to an increasing disposition of members ' wives to greet the New Year in the company of their spouses . Thanks to the hos-pitality of a member , we were happily on hand , and , following an excellent dinner of roast beef and Nuits-Saint-Georges ' 53 , we stood before the fireplace , which housed an excellent fire , as Mr. How-ard Lindsay , the club 's president , read congratulatory telegrams from a couple of absent , unimpeachably octogenarian members ; called attention to the clean-ing and restoration of the club 's Sar-gent portrait of Booth " as evidence that we take care of our heritage ; " read a poem by Thomas Bailey Aldrich celebrating the portrait of Booth ; and touched on some of the changes that had taken place since the club was founded . " When Richard Mansfield had din-ner here after the theatre , he stayed overnight at a nearby hotel , " Mr. Lind-say said . " He felt that it would he too much to undertake the long carriage trip uptown to his home , en Riverside Drive . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were intro-. duced to the joys of the cocktail in the days of prohibition , and they do n't like to drink alone , and this has cut down on our attendance during the cock-tail and dinner hours . I remember the time when a man would come in here for a drink in the late afternoon , pick up the telephone , say to his wife , ' I wo n't he home for dinner , ' and hang up . " Nostalgic applause greeted this forthright recollection . " For the past month , we have seen more of our news-papermen members than formerly , " Mr. Lindsay continued , and he pro-ceeded to introduce one of them  --  Mr. Turner Catledge , the managing editor of the Tinier and the speaker of the evening . " At last I 've come to exemplify one of the basic traditions of The Players , " Mr. Catledge said . " I 'm out of work ! ' Coming down through the ages , Mr. Catledge told of the club 's beginnings  --  it was originally planned in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including Aldrich , the actor Lawrence Barrett , and the editor Parke Godwin , during a cruise on a friend 's yacht  --  and of the solace it gave Booth , " a man who lost two wives and two fortunes , and suffered from the rash act of his brother . " Mr. Catledge went on to explain , " By the violence of his life , Booth became a target for loneliness . He was disturbed by the inferior social status of his profession . He left behind , here on Gramercy Park , a place where he could return not only his physical self but his emotional self . " Mr. Franklin Cover , a strikingly handsome actor , next read a letter of dedication that had accompanied Booth 's deed of gift , and Mr. Charles Connolly , the bar manager and an honorary member , passed  --  as he had done for the past thirty-five years  --  a great silver loving cup , from which the ninety-five men present took affectionate swallows . We descended to the bar and fell into conversation with Mr. John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-eight I ears ' standing . " The magic business is n't what it used to he , " he said . " Where in hell can I get a silk hat or a pair of white kid gloves from an audience today If 1 bring them along , they look like props . In the old days , when you performed before a family the father was a college graduate and that was that . Today , both parents are college graduates and three out of four grandparents are college graduates . They 're full of modern science , which takes the edge off magic . And the children ! I gave a show at the Union Club the other afternoon , and there was this four-year-old boy watching me narrowly . ' You know , Mr. Mulholland , ' he said when l was through , ' your performance was perfectly astounding . ' And recently a six-year-old girl at a party said , ' How much of what you just did was conjuring and how much was prestidigitation : ' I know how to handle grown-up drunks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Declarative IN this off-election year , we 'd like to nominate for the **31;2498;TOOLONG crown the author of the following communication , which was discovered in the apartment of a lady we know whose faucets were leaky : The plumber was here and fixed plumbing . THE PLUMBER Newcomer HAVING perambulated the bustling premises of the Standard , the sixday-a-week tabloid founded , according to a statement on the front page of Vol . I , No. 1 , " solely to serve as an interim medium until such time as the normal flow of newspapers is restored , " and talked with some of the people involved in its publication , we are prepared to tell you , to begin with , that the paper is the brain child of an ebullient thirty-nine-year-old recently transplanted Texan named Leonard E. B. Andrews , whose previous journalistic experience embraced the editing of a weekly Air Force newspaper ; die writing of a column and of numerous articles for banking and financial publications while he was serving as vice-president in charge of public relations and advertising of the Texas Bank &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he describes as " two books nobody ever heard of . " One of his financial articles  --  a three-thousand-word exposition of a plan he had devised for eliminating the use of checks in credit exchange , which was published three years ago in the iimerican Banker  --  caught the attention of , among others , a Californian named Joseph P. Williams , who was then a vice-president of the Bank of America . Williams struck up a correspondence with Andrews , and the two men subsequently met , left their banks , and migrated to New York , where , early last year , they became associated in the establishment of the Uni-Sery Corporation ( Williams is president , Andrews is vice-president ) , a credit-card organization whose clients consist mainly of New York retail stores  --  some eighty-five hundred of them in the five boroughs  --  a n d whose card-carrying members now number more than three hundred and fifty thousand . " Ours is what you might call a family credit card , " Mr. Andrews told us . " We 'd been thinking of expanding our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some similar publication , so the idea of putting out a paper had been in our minds before the newspaper strike . After the strike had gone on for a while , we saw the need for a regular newspaper here right away . We were sure it could do a real lot of good for all New Yorkers . " He discussed the project with Mr. Williams , secured his approval and the financial hacking of the corporation , and started wheeling and dealing . For an opener , he telephoned a friend of his named Harry L. Welker , Jr. , and offered him the job of editor of the new paper . " Like an idiot , I said ' Fine , ' " Mr. Welker told us . " We jumped feet first into this round-the-clock nightmare , and I 've seen my family once since . Normally , I live in Dnhhs Ferry . Now I 'm living , so to speak , at The Tuscany . " Mr. Welker , who is forty-three , sandy-haired , and freckled , began his journalistic career as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to such other enterprises as Time , the Denver Post , the King Features Syndicate , and the Herald Tribune Syndicate , of which he became editor . " I left there last summer , after five years , to pursue a couple of personal projects , " he said . " Those were pretty much wound up when Len Andrews called about this thing . " That was on December 20th , and at four-thirty that afternoon Welker and Andrews met at the Overseas Press Club . " We talked until about eleven o'clock , laying it all out , including the budget , " Andrews said . " So far , we 've come within five per cent of the original figures . Incidentally , we 're not in this to make money . We look on the Standard as a public service . At the same time , we 're trying not to lose money . It 's too early to say how that 's going to pan out . " Another participant in the initial discussion was a friend and contemporary of Andrews named Leonard Saflir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , first in Dallas and then in Tokyo , and had later established his own public-relations firm in Manhattan . " We 've been working until three or four o'clock in the morning ever since Len asked me to come in as his assistant , " Mr. Safi-if , a dark-haired , quiet-spoken man , told us . " I have n't set foot in my own office since . " A couple of days after the original meeting , John L. Catucci , the realestate-advertising manager of the Pest , became the new paper 's advertising director . " It was just what I was looking for , " Mr. Catucci , the only member of the Standard staff who customarily wears a jacket at work , told us . " I did n't want to work for a publication that was going to be in business after the strike . When I heard about this  --  a public service , a quite sincere effort to fill a void  --  I said , ' Gee whizz , I 'd consider it a privilege to play on that ball team . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the four-man staff tackled the myriad tasks involved in bringing to life the paper that had been named the Standard . That was one of seven names the staff had contemplated . " We 'd thought of things like Gazette , Press-News , Bulletin , and , of course , there were some whimsical suggestions , too , " Mr. Welker told us . " Probably the most apropos , as it turned out , was the Daily Miracle . We picked the name Standard because that was the first one the lawyers cleared . My main job , naturally , was getting a staff . As soon as I decided to take the job , I began phoning people I wanted  --  mostly as department heads . I let them recruit the people they wanted to work with . We lined up about fifty for the editorial side . With only one or two exceptions , all of them , from department heads to copy boys , came from the nine unpublished papers . Marshall Peck , of the Herald Tribune , became head of the foreign desk ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national desk ; John Bowen , of the Daily News , news editor ; Joe Donnelly , also of the News , city editor ; Steve Tyno , the Times , sports editor ; Allyn Baum , the Times , picture editor ; Marilyn Mercer , the Trib , woman's-page editor ; Elinor Klein , the Trib , amusements editor ; and William Robbins , the Times , financial editor . These people signed on others : Milton Bracker , the Times , for the city desk ; Henry Walter , the World-Telegram , for City Hall ; Tony Marino , the /Vows , for police headquarters  --  and I could go on . In short , one hell of an impressive staff . " Meanwhile , John Catucci was recruiting an advertising staff of about forty , and Andrews and Saflir were coping with the problems of office space and printing . " We needed ten thousand feet of space that we could rent on a weekly basis , and that 's not too easy to find in New York , " Saflir said . " The place also had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decent location , and so forth . " On December 27th , he rented Floor 12-A of 270 Madison Avenue . On the morning of December 31st , he concluded arrangements to furnish the premises with rented equipment , and that afternoon he supervised the moving in of seventy desks , seventy typewriters ( not everybody is there at the same time ) , and numerous chairs , wastebaskets , in-and-out baskets , a coat rack , a water cooler , and other necessities . " Where but in New York could you set up an office practically on New Year 's Eve ? " Mr. Saflir concluded , still slightly awed . The Standard 's newly hired department heads checked in on the day the office was being furnished , and the full staff reported for work on Wednesday , January 2nd . The first issue of the paper was scheduled to appear the following Sunday . Though the printing problem had been a sticky one , Mr. Andrews thought he had finally solved it by arranging to farm out the typesetting to four commercial typographers , collect what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transport the whole works to a printing concern that would turn nut the paper . Early Saturday morning , he found that this plan had gone askew . " After I thought I had it all sewed up , the printer called the deal off , " Mr. Andrews said . " There I was with forty pages of mats  --  Sunday 's paper on my hands , and no place to print them . I picked up the phone and made some calls , and finally closed a deal to have the paper printed in Elizabeth , on the presses of the Daily Journal . Then Len Saffir and I got in my car to take the mats over . We 'd been forty-eight hours without any sleep to speak of , and we got lost twice getting there . We finally made it , and the presses started rolling at about five-thirty . We took the first three hundred copies , tied them up into two bundles , tossed them in the car , and drove hack to the office . We walked in with these two big bundles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have seen the reaction of those veteran newsmen . They let out a roar like something you hear after a pinch-hit homer in a World Series . The Standard was off the ground . It was a miracle . " The atmosphere around the Standard office continues to be one of pleased amazement . " The mechanical side is still incredible , " Mr. Welker said . " It 's getting a little smoother , though . The type is collected from the various typographers , and when the mats are made they are taken to the heliport downtown , and from there they 're flown by helicopter to Newark Airport , where a car picks them up and takes them on to Elizabeth . It 's real pony-express stuff . As for the editorial side , that 's no less incredible . To get out that first issue , these people worked twenty- and twenty-four-hour days  --  on the last stretch I myself worked without interruption for twenty-eight hours  --  and they 're continuing to just knock themselves out . People do n't work like this for money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some cases higher , for department heads  --  and staff members can collect their pay by the week or by the day , whichever they wish . Money- aside , there 's something special about this operation . We 're getting better every day , the ads are flooding us , and we 're looking to a million circulation . But there 's no letup in the pressure . It 's still perpetual hysteria . "
