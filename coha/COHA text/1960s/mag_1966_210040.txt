THE TELEPHONE Ringing in the Suspect <P> The phone can ring at any hour of the day or night . There on the other end of the line is the unidentified voice , mouthing obscenities or threats . The receiver in most cases is a woman , often in a city apartment . Until now , her only way out of such repeated and nerve-shattering harassment has been to change the telephone number and have it unlisted . For , as she quickly discovers , simply hanging up does not break the circuit , which is controlled by the caller . To apprehend him , the police tell the victim to keep the caller talking until they can trace the call and , in some cases , have her make an appointment with the caller . <P> Abusive calls have increased so much in recent years-New England Telephone Co. estimates up to 1,500 a month are made in its area-that A.T . &; T. Chairman Frederick Kappel has called for a crackdown , and individual Bell companies are now declaring statewide " wars on obscene calls . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " called-party holding , " which the telephone company hooks up free . It consists of a small signal box that is linked to the nearest central office . By simply pushing the button on the box , the victim signals the central office , which immediately locks the circuit . Even if the caller hangs up , the circuit remains open and the telephone company can begin tracing the call . <P> The device is not foolproof . Calls made from party lines make tracing tough . But already it is paying dividends in terms of arrests . With slight variations , New Jersey Bell Telephone has been using it since last fall , Bell in Pennsylvania since the first of the year . In Rockland , Me. , the device pinpointed a 17-year-old boy who had been pestering a family with several teen-age girls . And in Massachusetts it has led to a dozen convictions in the past six months on charges of harassment and use of obscene language , resulting in sentences ranging from a $200 fine to three months in prison .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
