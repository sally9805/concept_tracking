txt Vice President Humphrey , campaigning in California , strongly reaffirmed today his support of American involvement in Vietnam but promised to take a fresh look at the war " with new advisers " if he won the Presidency . His pledge to reassess the war next January , which he coupled with a firm defense of President Johnson and his present policies , came during a local television interview in Sacramento this morning . The interview marked the beginning of a busy day in the Humphrey campaign in which the Democratic nominee ac cused Richard M. Nixon of misreading the crime problem in America , compared the dissidents who have hooted and heckled him to " Hitler 's storm troopers , " and participated in a motorcade in downtown San Francisco . Identities Not Disclosed He did not reveal the identities of his " new advisers " when he first mentioned them this morning . But his comments assumed greater meaning later in the day with the announcements ; " from Wash ington , that Arthur J. Goldberg would play a major role in his New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as chief United States representative to the United Nations to become his chief foreign policy adviser . Both men are known to have had misgivings about some aspects of the Administration 's war policy , which Mr. Humphrey has consistently defended . Accordingly , their sudden and dramatic arrival on the scene added fuel to speculation here that Mr. Humphrey might well make a fresh attempt to disassociate himself from Mr. , Johnson on the war . His remarks today , however , in what his advisers regard as a major foreign policy state-1 ment , gave little support to this interpretation . He indicated that he still shared the fundamental assumptions behind the Johnson policy , promising that he would " inventory " in January America 's commitments in Vietnam and would , more broadly , completely reappraise America 's peacekeeping role in the world at large . In his television appearance , for example , he compared Vietnam to Korea , saying that both had been " wars of policy , " undertaken to honor America 's commitments and defend smaller nations against Communist aggression . " I sincerely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been the cost , that our stand in Vietnam has surely been of some significant help to the lives of the people in Southeast Asia and to stability and security in that part of the world . " And that is vital to our national interest , because if all Asia were to go Communist , and fall prey to aggression , or at least all of Southeast Asia , the power balance hi this world wouicl ? be thrown out of kilter , completely , and there 's no way of pfedicting what the cost would be to this country in terms of its own defense . ' Mr. Humphrey 's re-affirmation . of the basic tenets of the Administration 's heavy involvement in Southeast . Asia gave rise to still a second interpretation of the appointment of Mr. Ball and Mr. Goldberg to key posts in his . campaign . . This- interpretation holds that Mr. Humphrey has no real intention of disassociating himself from Mr. Johnson , but at least wants to offer the doves in his party the hope that , if elected , he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Take Stock In this sense , Mr. Ball and Mr. Goldberg are seen as a largely , symbolic concession to the ' doves . In both the interview and a king policy statement called a " New Strategy for Peace , " Mr. Humphrey offered himself as a man who , after the election , would not be afraid to make changes in American commitments , in Vietnam or anywhere else . During the interview , he said : " Whenever you change management you ought to take an inventory . I am going to take stock , not only in Vietnam , but throughout the world to see whether the policies that we are following are relevant " " If it 's not working , we should feel no obligation to keep at it simply because a Democratic President ? Truman or Kennedy or President Johnson ? designed it . It may have served its needs for one time , but is no longer necessary . " If we need a new policy for new situations , I 'm going to have the courage to say so . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to have the courage to say so . ' , " If we need to change our military or diplomatic posture relating . to Vietnam to obtain an . honorable peace , I 'm going to have the courage to say so . " And in the policy statement ? part of which he delivered to a luncheon audience of members of the Commonwealth Club ? Mr. Humphrey pledged that if he was elected he would pursue a many-pronged " strategy for peace , ' , ' designed , in part , to reduce America 's worldwide commitments and encourage other , nations to bear a larger share of . the responsibility for resisting aggression . Calling for a reassessment " of our national interest " and a redefining of " our goals and . priorities , " Mr. Humphrey suggested that fresh , efforts be made to develop " regional and multilateral responsibility " among smaller nations . He added : " Not only should we encourage regional cooperation  --  such as we see in the Alliance for Progress , the Asian and African Development Banks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where possible , unilateral involvement , either militarily or economically ? where multilateral means are available . Global Role Questioned " The United States can not play the role of global gendarme , " he declared , which is a point his chief opponent , Mr. Nixon , has also been making in some of his recent speeches . Striking a fresh note , the Democratic nominee called for new efforts to strengthen the United Nations and make It " the instrument for controlling conflict it has so far failed to be . " Noting that past peacekeeping efforts by the United Nadons had been hampered by lack of funds and lack of manpower , he called on members of . the United Nations to " earmark and train units of their armed forces for international peacekeeping assignments . " He pledged specifically to : filUse the United States ' military assistance program to help less-developed countries prepare units of their armed forces for United Nations and other " peacekeeping " assignments ; 913egin new efforts to resolve the world body 's financial crisis ; IThielp create a United Nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial contribution of S20-million.
