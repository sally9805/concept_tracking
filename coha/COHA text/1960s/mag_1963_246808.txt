( See Cover ) <P> He skylarks down the scruffy street , the colored slum kid in the Northern city , headed for the public school . He wears a white shirt with a bow tie , and a good warm windbreaker . His smile is toothy , his epithets vile . He is eight , and ca n't read much . His teacher , a man with a heart of case-hardened gold , sometimes thinks of him as a " little bastard , " but the boy has good intelligence and intentions . Such , in many variations , is the " disadvantaged " child , and he and his like now comprise one-third of all pupils in the nation 's 14 largest cities . <P> They are the rural dispossessed-Southern Negroes , Appalachian whites , Puerto Ricans , Mexican-Americans-who fill the urban void left by middle-class migration to the suburbs . They share the American dream of salvation by education and go to the public school that everyone says will save them . Why is it that just the opposite happens so often in city schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of this question is New York City , where the nation 's biggest school system has just acquired a highly skilled school superintendent who may have some of the answers . At 44 , Calvin Edward Gross is a man with more than a million children , almost half of them Negro or Puerto Rican . Seven months in office , he feels ready to cope with the hardest school job in the country . " We are now enjoying the best fall beginning we 've had for a long time , " Gross peppily wrote his teachers not long ago . " Let 's take it from here . " <P> How far anyone can take New York City depends on reconciling the disparity between the nature of the children and the nature of the school system . New York City has long specialized in educating immigrants , but these children-being Americans to begin with-are different . They are shorn of the drive that spurred their predecessors , weirdly cut off from the middle-class culture that teachers abide by . <P> <P> " I do n't want to grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manhattan slum kid recently . Such children know adults who can not even read the want ads , and sense the despair of unskilled teen-agers loitering on streets where drink , dope or death is the only exit . Yet as other Americans reach new heights of affluence and aspiration , slum kids are made to feel all the more worthless by their poverty and the color of their skin . Often , dinner is a hamburger served in a paper bag ; books are nonexistent ; home is a rooming house so transient that in a recent year 50% of all Manhattan pupils switched schools , making a mockery of sustained education . " <P> " Try the Post Office . " IQ tests use middle-class references that the slum child does not understand ; his low score then plunks him into the slow group . He is repelled from reading by fatuous primers about " nice " children who seem laughable even in the suburbs , let alone in Harlem . Harried principals stand ready to expel him ; guidance counselors are reluctant to encourage him too much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you can do . Try the post office . "
