txt Talk about devaluing the dollar mounts . But also mounting among many financial authorities is the conviction that , for all practical purposes , such a step is impossible . The U.S. could , of course , raise the official price at which it buys and sells gold in transactions with other governments . This is the sort of " devaluation " that the U.S. may be " on the road to . " according to Federal Reserve Board Chairman William McChesney Martin . But to devalue the dollar in terms of other currencies  --  the sort of devaluation that would bolster the dollar 's sagging position in world markets  --  would be a very different matter . The U.S. could change the dollar 's value in terms of gold to , say , $70 an ounce , twice the current official value . But , analysts note , this would not necessarily mean that the dollar would be worth 312.5 Italian lire instead of 625 as at present or two West German marks instead of the present four . Other countries could  --  and very well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationships with the dollar from changing . Foreigners ' Attitude " It 's entirely up to the other countries , " declares Peter B. Kenen , chairman of the economics department of Columbia University . The consensus among economists is that foreign governments would block devaluation of the dollar in terms of their own currencies . Their logic is not hard to understand : Allow the dollar to depreciate in terms of your own currency ( so that U.S. exports , for example , become cheaper and imports become more costly for Americans ) , and you permit Uncle Sam . a mighty new advantage in the world marketplace . It was precisely to improve its competitive position that the United Kingdom devalued the pound by 14.3% last November ; many analysts say that it is still too early to assess the results of the U.K. move , though they think it should prove at least modestly successful in the long run , provided that most other major countries do not follow suit . Such a devaluation of the U.S. dollar , however , would be intolerable to major foreign governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysts believe , a few major foreign countries might decide to increase slightly the value of their own currencies in terms of the dollar , presumably through the sort of action carried out by West Germany , for instance , in early 1961 . At that time , West Germany revalued the mark at 4 to the dollar ; previously , the official exchange rate was 4.2 marks to the dollar . The Titan of Trade Foreign reluctance to permit a significant dollar devaluation reflects diverse factors , according to analysts . Foreigners generally feel that the U.S. already is the titan of world trade ; unlike Britain , America boasts a long string of huge trade surpluses over the post-World War II years . Though these surpluses have recently become smaller  --  and are clearly inflated by commodity exports financed through U.S. aid to foreigners ? they remain the envy of many capitals abroad . It 's widely believed that foreigners simply would not allow the U.S. to enjoy still greater trade surpluses through a unilateral devaluation . On top of this , on the purely political level , mapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dollar 's present difficulty stems from Vietnam , these officials claim . So why should the U.S. be allowed to improve its trade position simply in order to facilitate the carrying on of the Vietnam war ? Although foreign counteraction could eliminate any competitive edge that the U.S. might seek through devaluation , many economists note that a devaluation of the dollar in terms of gold would still have some important ramifications . An Inflationary Influence Take , for instance , the possible effects of a gold price increase to $70 an ounce . While not all economists agree , in theory at least , such a U.S. move would exert an inflationary influence around the globe in a variety of ways . It would sharply increase the wealth of countless foreign gold-holders , enlarge the money supply in many nations , relieve the U.S. and other lands from having to adopt restrictive measures ( such as boosting taxes and trimming governmental spending ) to hold on to dwindling monetary reserves . Beyond economics , an increase in the U.S. gold price would produce awkward political consequences . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has persistently contravened U.S. wishes and cashed in its dollars for gold . On the other hand , it would penalize such countries as West Germany , which has obligingly refrained from massive gold-buying . Moreover , a gold price rise would greatly benefit the big gold producers , South Africa and the Soviet Union . Neither nation , obviously , is a favorite of Uncle Sam . One U.S. official estimates that doubling the gold price would " permit the Russians to expand their foreign aid programs by at least 50% . " Surveying such prospects , Gabriel Hauge , president of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. , recently told a London audience : " In my judgment , if some future events should require a basic decision on the gold-dollar relationship , the decision would be to demonetize gold rather than to devalue the dollar in terms of gold . " Unless a gold price increase were " very large , " the bank president added , " it would soon generate expectations of the next round " of gold price increases . One extreme possibility if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other countries might treat the dollar like any other commodity , allowing the law of supply and demand to determine whether it would be worth , say , 625 lire or 1,000 lire or 500 lire . If analysts who contend that foreign governments wouldn't. allow the dollar to depreciate are correct , however , such a " floating " dollar would presumably remain worth 625 lire or 4 marks ; in such circumstances , it 's presumed that other governments would , in effect , support the dollar in foreign exchange dealings , buying dollars when the price of a dollar threatened to sink and selling when the price threatened to increase . ( The U.S. , some analysts say , could also decide to support the dollar , rather than gold , as at present , without necessarily breaking international monetary agreements . ) It is possible , to be sure , that considerable day-to-day uncertainty over the value of a " floating " dollar could develop . In that event , some economists contend , international businessmen most likely would hesitate to go ahead with deals , unsure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currencies . In the end , some fear , such a situation would inhibit international commerce and capital movements ; international business might shrivel and in the process depress the level of domestic business round the world . If world commerce and capital flows were to dry up , however , many economists say that most foreign lands would be more severely affected than the U.S. They reason that foreign trade bulks much larger in most foreign economies than in the relatively self-sufficient U.S. Many analysts who doubt that the foreign governments would allow a unilateral devaluation of the dollar also note that foreigners have already showed considerable restraint in not retaliating against such U.S. moves as placing special , taxes on purchases of foreign securities and the new restrictions on direct corporate investments abroad . Such moves , these analysts contend , are tantamount to a small unilateral devaluation of the dollar . They tend to make the dollar less valuable because they limit what can be done with it . Many economists believe that the U.S. has gone absolutely as far as it dares with such " camouflaged devaluations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction , it 's believed by many , would not be allowed . Other countries would simply retaliate in kind .
