New York 's Governor Nelson Rockefel ler pressed a lever , and psss-CHUNK ! -a pile driver began to hammer in the first pile for a 200-ft. observation tower , the highest structure at the New York World 's Fair 1964-65 , and part of New-York State 's elegant $5,000.000 pavilion , designed by Architect Philip Johnson . The fair , declared the Governor , was going to be a vast success , visited by 70 million people , and yielding " lasting benefits as a magnificent showcase . ' ' <P> The 646-acre site in Flushing Meadow looked less like a showcase last week than a sordid battlefield of machinery and men . And inside the administration building , the generalissimo of it all . Fair President Robert Moses , kept things moving like the centurion in the Gospels , who described himself as a man who says " Go . and he goeth ; and to another . Come , and he cometh . " <P> $20 Million Cancellation . There has been more coming than going . Already in the foundation stage are the buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Electric Power &; Light . Ford . Festival of Gas , IBM , General Motors , Sinclair Oil , Travelers Insurance , and the heliport . The international exhibitors are somewhat farther behind ; 65 foreign exhibitors have declared their " intent " to be present . Of these , at least 35 have signed up for specific space , 17 have submitted designs . and two - Hong Kong and Vatican City* - have started test borings . Altogether , 83% of international area space has been allocated , 71% of the industrial area , and 77% of the transportation area . Thirty states , so far , have agreed to come in . <P> But there has been some going , too . Most notable : the announcement from the Soviet Union last fortnight canceling Russia 's building , which was to have been the fair 's largest , budgeted for $20 million ( Congress has appropriated $17 million for the U.S. entry ) . <P> Funny Business . For the present , at least , New Yorkers are most aware of their fair in terms of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borough of Queens . Travelers taxiing into the city from La Guardia and Idlewild airports are sometimes dumfounded to find a full-fledged traffic jam of early bird commuters at 6 a.m . But fair officials seem confident that when the new network of roads is in operation , their facilities will be able to handle a traffic-jamless 36,000 people an hour coming by car or bus . <P> With such round figures to deal in , Robert Moses and his aides are inoculated against most of the hair-tearing problems that are bound to pile up between now and opening day - and after . As Moses himself says : " The fair is a funny business , if , indeed , it can be called a business at all . It involves a strange combination of engineering and showmanship . It is part theater , part traveling carnival . part insubstantial pageant and part permanent park . " <P> <P> * Pope John has agreed to send Michelangelo 's famed Picta , which will be leaving St. Peter 's Church for the first time since it was placed there in 1749. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
