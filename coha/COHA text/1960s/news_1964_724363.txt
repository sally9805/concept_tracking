txt J. Edgar Hoover , the usually taciturn director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , spoke out publicly today about the Warren Commission 's report on the assassination of President Kennedy and about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. , the Negro civil rights leader . In a meeting with selected Washington newswomen that was as remarkable for its three-hour length as for its mere occurrence , Mr. Hoover loosed a broadside of uncharacteristic public charges . He denounced the Warren Commission 's criticism of his bureau for not warning the Secret Service that Lee Harvey Oswald was a potential threat to the President . He called the criticism " unfair and unjust " and " a classic example of Monday morning quarterbacking . " He attacked Dr. King , head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference , as " the most notorious liar in the country . " Mr. Hoover said Dr. King had asserted that F.B.I . agents in Georgia were failing to act on Negroes ' complaints because the agents were Southerners . He based his assessment of Dr. King on this reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobel Peace Prize last Oct. 14 as " the person who has done most for the furtherance of brotherhood among men , " was not available for comment tonight . Aides said he was vacationing in the Bahamas and would have no reply ' until tomorrow , at the earliest . Many civil rights workers in the South have long been dis satisfied with the bureau 's role in communities where there has been anti-Negro violence . Mr. Hoover 's remarks were not made generally available to newsmen , but bureau spokesmen confirmed the accuracy of various reports of the session . Mr. Hoover is known to have been deeply angered by the criticisms of the bureau in the , Warren Commission report . His scorn was plain today . " It is not a fair report as far as the is concerned , " he declared . He specifically attacked the commission 's suggestion that " an alert ageficy , such as the F.B.I . " should have ' had the foresight to list Oswald , the assassin , " as a potential threat to the safety of the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The commission called this omission by the bureau an example of " an unduly restrictive view of its responsibilities . " The bureau itself subsequently dis-il ciplined and reassigned the two agents implicated by the commission . The commission 's recommen dation for better communications between the bureau and the Secret Service has resulted in the bureau 's sending thousands of names to the White House security detail each time the President journeys out of town , Mr. Hoover said . The Secret Service is " hopelessly undermanned and illequipped to do the job it is supposed to do , " he said . He asserted that the bureau 's new function had " also charged the F. B. I. with the obligations of a psychiatrist . " It was not Mr. Hoover 's first criticism of the commission , but it was his strongest . In closed testimony before the commission , Mr. Hoover warned that the recommendations would tighten safety precautions around the President to the point where the country would approach " totalitarian security . " This brush with the commission did not become known until last Oct. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimony available to The Washington Evening Star . The testimony has yet to be released by the commission . Mr. Hoover , who will be 70 lyears old Jan. 1 , would ordinarily have to retire on his birthday . However , President Johnson has been considering Waiving the compulsory retirement age to permit Mr. Hoover to remain as director past the age of 70 . Some observers here raised the question whether Mr. Hoover 's remarks today might not have a bearing on the President 's decision . Mr. Hoover 's attack on Dr. King was based on the clergyman 's reported advice to other civil rights workers not to report acts of violence or other violations to F.B.I . agents in Albany , Ga. , because the agents there were all Southerners and would do nothing . Albany has been the scene of prolonged racial violence . " The truth is , " Mr. Hoover declared , " that 70 per cent of the agents in the South were born in the North and four out of five agents in Albany , Ga. , are Northerners . " A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albany were from Kingston , N. Y. ; Auburn , Ind. ; Arlington , Mass. , and St. Peter , Minn. , " and Dr. King knew it . " Mr. Hoover 's wrath fell with unusual , if not equal , frankness on both sides in the civil rights struggle , He charged that " red-necked ' sheriffs " in Mississippi and members of the Ku Klux Klan had participated in racial violence , But his harshest remarks were addressed to Dr. King . He repeatedly stressed the recurring theme that the bureau did not protect anyone . He said that included the President and " those who go down to reform the South . " Mr. Hoover contended that in New York City alone there were 7,000 persons who would have to be picked up by the police every time the President went there if it became necessary to round up " every individual who might threaten the safety of the President . " Mr. Hoover charged that agents investigating civil rights cases in the Mississippi swamps had been hampered because that area was " filled with water moccasins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same category as far as I am concerned . " He exempted , however , the Mississippi Highway Patrol , which he said had cooperated with the bureau in investigating the murders of three civil rights workers last summer near Associated Press J. Edgar Hoover Philadelphia , Miss . He said great progress had been made in that investigation . On several counts , he had harsh things to say about the courts , including the Supreme Court . Referring to " bleeding hearts who want to - move the age of juvenile delinquency up to 21 " to soften the legal consequences of crime on more mature youths , Mr. Hoover said , " I think it should be moved back to 16 . " Mist jurisdictions regard youths tinder 18 as juveniles . " Some of our bleeding heart judges ought to have more guts when it comes to handing down sentences , " Mr. Hoover said . " You ca n't safely walk the streets of Washington , D. C. , even in the daylight . " In New York City 's Central Park , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are holdups on Fifth Avenue at 9:30 or 10 at night . " He also fastened the " bleeding heart " label on the Justices of the Supreme Court who had ruled that prisoners in Washington , D , C. , must be arraigned promptly after their arrest and could not he held for questioning without a specific charge . On other points , Mr. Hoover declared : cOn the John Birch Society ? " We have never investigated the society . I have no respect for the head of the society , Robert Welch . " Mr. Hoover was the subject of a laudatory article in the society 's magazine last month . cOn the Ku Klux Klan and the Minutemen ? " We are looking into the activities of the Minutemen . There is nothing more like the Ku Klux Klan and we have done a job on them . " He said that " all of the lynchings and the bombings of homes in the South " were the work of Klan members . He said , " We know pretty well who they are . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken the position that there is no such thing as a lie detector . It has to be operated by a human being , Whenever a human being reaches conclusions , he is apt to make an error . " ( iOn firearms control ? " I think strong laws should be passed restricting the sale of guns , but when you try you run head on into collision with the National Rifle Association . " cOn the American Nazi party ? The bureau is watching the activities of its leader , George Lincoln Rockwell . " He is bigoted and biased and I would n't pay much attention to anything he said . " The news conference was unusual for Mr. Hoover , who , rarely even grants interviews . ' , One bureau spokesman said hel could not recall the director 's ' , holding " a regular news con-I ference . " It was his third uncharacter- ' istically controversial move in recent weeks . The testimony criticizing the Warren Commission was leaked Oct. 2 . Then , on Oct. 15 , Mr. Hoover sent flowers and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the former special assistant to President Johnson who resigned Oct. 14 after disclosure of two morals arrests , That gesture brought upon Mr. Hoover some of the harshest criticism of his 40-year career from spokesmen of conservative viewpoints who had been among his stanchest admirers . The bureau was subsequently ordered to investigate the security aspects of the Jenkins case , and Mr. Hoover 's critics charged that his " blunder " had " compromised " the bureau . Dr. King on Island In Atlanta , an aide to Dr. King said last night by telephone that the civil rights leader was on Bimini Island , off the coast of Miami Beach , and could not be reached for comment before the morning . Meanwhile , a prominent biracial group in the South criticized the F. B. L 's role in Albany . Leslie W. Dunbar , executive director of the Southern Regional Council , said in Atlanta , " The main drawback to vigorous enforcement of civil rights by the P. B. is their organizational approach of working very closely with local law-enforcement ' authorities . "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
