The suspicion is that Harry Hopman , coach of Australia 's Davis Cup team , picks his players as much for the hang of their jaws as the strength of their forearms and wrists . At least it looked that way last week , when Hopman and his prognathous protgs posed proudly with a sterling-silver heirloom . And why not stick out their chins ? The Aussies have been inviting the world to come fight for the Davis Cup every year . But hardly anyone makes much of a scrap of it . <P> Australia 's Challenge Round opponent this time was India , and rarely , if ever , have the Davis Cup finalists been so obviously mismatched . All four Aussies-Fred Stolle , Tony Roche , Roy Emerson and John Newcombe-were ranked among the top ten amateur tennis players in the world . <P> Neither of India 's two challengers , Ramanathan Krishnan and Jaideep Mukherjea , had ever won a major tournament ; and neither was ranked . Krishnan and Mukherjea had reached the Challenge Round by beating a couple of similarly unranked Brazilians-who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not going to be overawed , " insisted Raj Kumar Khanna , India 's nonplaying captain , as the match got under way in Melbourne 's Kooyong Stadium . " The whole world lives on hope . " <P> Maybe so . But in tennis , Australia springs eternal . Displaying the form that has won him two Wimbledon titles , four Australian championships , a U.S. and a French championship in the last four years , Emerson swept both of his singles matches in straight sets-polishing off Mukherjea in 66 min. , Krishnan in 95 min . Fred Stolle 's " big " serve , the biggest in the amateur game , did the rest . Aceing Krishnan twelve times and Mukherjea 20 times , Stolle won the other two singles matches to give the Davis Cup to Australia for the 21st time and the 14th in the last 17 years . <P> The Indians only managed to avoid a shutout by upsetting Roche and Newcombe in the doubles , 4-6 , 7-5 , 6-4 , 6-4 . <P> The real consolation for the losers came in reports that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that Stolle , 28 , was planning to turn pro-following in the footsteps of Dennis Ralston , the U.S. 's top-ranked player , who signed a $100,000 contract last week . <P> The loss of Emerson and Stolle could cripple Australia 's Davis Cup chances next year-although the loss of Ralston , in the view of one expert , just might boost U.S. chances for the cup . Said Aussie Coach Harry Hopman : " I do n't think America will miss Ralston from the team . He did not have a very good record in Davis Cup matches . "
