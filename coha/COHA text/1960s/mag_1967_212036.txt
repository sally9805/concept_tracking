Last month he was in the White House reporting to President Johnson on the troubled temper of the nation 's cities . Three weeks ago he was in Saigon observing the Vietnamese elections . <P> Fortnight ago he was in Gibraltar watching the plebiscite on whether ownership of the Rock should revert to Spain . Last week Brobdingnagian ( 6 ft. 5 in. , 280 lbs. ) , peripatetic Richard M. Scammon was back in his office in Washington , busily psephologizing as one of the capital 's most sought-after ad viserson political trends . <P> Flypaper Memory . Director of the U.S. Bureau of the Census from 1961 to 1965 , Scammon , 52 , comes to his role steeped in statistics and unafraid of conclusions . Vice President Hubert Humphrey , a longtime Minnesota friend , calls Scammon " one of the smartest men in town , " adds : " He is n't just a statistician-he 's a profound and deep student . " British Political Scientist Harold Laski , under whom Scammon studied for a year at the London School of Economics , pronounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " CBS 's Washington Commentator Eric Sevareid , a University of Minnesota classmate , ascribes a " flypaper memory " to Scammon , says , " he 's always startling you by coming up with the vote in some borough in England in 1872 . " His mastery of U.S. statistics is even more phenomenal . Scammon can recite from memory the political , social , economic and ethnic characteristics of hundreds of congressional districts throughout the nation . <P> Such praise results from Scammon 's thorough knowledge of a huge bin of sociological statistics , from which he is able to sniff out the elusive mood of the voters and come up with the right answer . Though he is obviously not always right , he has been so consistently accurate that political bosses , Presidents , Congressmen and Washington observers have come to depend on his analyses . He was , for example , one of the minuscule band of political scientists who thought Harry Truman had a chance to win in 1948 . <P> No. 1 Issue . Scammon 's prescience springs in large part from his wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. and abroad . He has observed and analyzed elections for the U.S. Government , and , in his capacity as the director of the Elections Research Center of the privately operated Governmental Affairs Institute , in a clutch of other countries , including Russia , Israel and the Dominican Republic . He has served as a senior consultant to the Lou Harris Poll ( 1959-61 ) , is now chairman of the Select Committee on Western Hemisphere Immigration , a senior research consultant to the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders , and wheelhorse of NBC 's nonstaff election consultants . Between times , Scammon has , somehow , managed to edit all five volumes of America Votes , a classic reference work on U.S. elections , and collaborate on This U.S.A. , a lively , statistically based debunking of the doomcrier 's view of U.S. problems .
