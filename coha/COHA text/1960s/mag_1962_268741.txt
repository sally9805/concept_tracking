When Dwight Eisenhower reached past nine senior generals in August of 1959 to select David Monroe Shoup as commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps , no one was more surprised than Shoup himself . <P> Said he : " This is the first pot I ever won without having a hand in the game . " Through his performance and personality , Commandant Shoup , 57 , has had his hand very much in the game ever since - to the point that he has become President Kennedy 's favorite service chief . <P> Since taking charge , " Uncle Dave " Shoup has presided over a boost in Marine manpower from 175,000 to 190,000 , upgraded the First Marine Brigade on Hawaii as the nucleus of a Fourth Division . With its air support , it can be deployed anywhere on 30 days ' notice , and , says Shoup , " I would n't be ashamed to put it in ? " He has ordered promotion exams for officers as well as noncoms . <P> On the theory that marines do not pause in combat for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the annual physical fitness tests , instead has his men climb ropes , march three miles , dash 50 yards to retrieve a presumably wounded buddy while being timed by a stopwatch . He works the men longer , stressing night training and field exercises . <P> His orders : " Get used to the field mice , screech owls , coyotes and katydids . " Searching Their Faces . Apart from his performance , his brusque manner and salty language has endeared him to the corps . An Indiana farm boy who took a math major at DePauw University and went directly into the Marines from ROTC , Shoup earned a Congressional Medal of Honor by directing the 2nd Marine Division in its bloody , 76-hour assault on Tarawa , despite a badly wounded leg . Terse and tough , he constantly urges his commanders to know their men better . He asks them : " Do you search the faces of your men every day ? Do you know their problems ? Are you helping them ? " <P> In meetings of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Shoup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While he argued successfully for more marines , he has no grandiose ideas about the capabilities of the corps . Says he : " We ca n't do six or seven or eight divisions ' worth of fighting , but we sure as hell can do three divisions ' worth . " After a JCS discussion on the use of chemicals to defoliate guerrilla hiding spots , Shoup dismissed the whole thing with the comment : " I 've been using defoliants at my farm in West Virginia for years , and they do n't work worth a damn . " <P> " How Damn Good ? " In recent weeks , Shoup has made headline news by his insistence to the Senate subcommittee on military " muzzling " that his marines do not need instruction about the theory and practice of Communism in order to fight Communists . All a marine needs to know about an enemy , says Shoup , is " how damn good he is " as a fighter . Nor does Uncle Dave have any opinion at all on where or when the Marines should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he declares , " our equipment , weapons and training will stand us in good stead . Whether we go or not is none of my damned business . "
