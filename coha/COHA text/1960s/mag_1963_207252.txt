Plastic shoes have been around for years , and 35 companies now turn them out . But plastic has mostly been used for cheap shoes because it does not breathe like leather and usually makes feet hot and uncomfortable . Now a plastic-like material has been developed that looks , feels and breathes like leather , and is said to wear better and cost less to make . For the $700 million leather industry , which devotes 85% of its business to producing leather for shoe uppers , a challenge is at hand as great as the one that faced the textile industry a dozen years ago . Says Boston Shoemaker Hector Lynch , president of Howard &; Foster Co. : " This may well be the nylon of the leather industry . " <P> The threat to the industry comes largely from giant Du Pont , which has developed its own synthetic material for shoes after 13 years of searching in the labs . Du Pont is producing the material at a pilot plant in Newburgh , N.Y. , is building a plant in Tennessee for full-scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to building overseas plants . The largest U.S. shoemaker , St. Louis ' International Shoe Co .. hopes to make shoes from Du Pont 's material by spring of 1964 , and other firms are sure to follow . A similar synthetic material has been developed by New Jersey 's small Arnav Industries Inc. , which plans to produce 5,000 pairs of children 's shoes a day by summer , is buying a plant in Pennsylvania to turn out 20,000 pairs a day by year 's end . <P> Secretive as Russians . Both Du Pont and Arnav are as secretive as Russians about their processes , but both achieved breakthroughs by finding a method of putting thousands of microscopic holes into synthetics to enable them to " breathe . " Both firms shy away from calling the synthetics plastics ; Du Pont is calling its product a " poromeric material " ( meaning full of microscopic holes ) until it can decide on a trademark name . The shoe material is made in two or three layers : outside is a polyvinyl chloride film that can be treated to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is either a layer of nylon or orlon ( Du Pont ) or one of polyurethane foam ( Arnav ) ; the shoe 's inside layer is one of the standard lining materials . <P> The new shoes are said to be waterproof and scuff-resistant and are supposed to keep a permanent shine . Both Du Pont 's and Arnav 's new material has the advantage of coming in uniform , easy-to-handle rolls instead of in awkward pieces shaped like a cow . Though the new material is thus much cheaper to produce than leather , Du Pont has no intention of damaging its discovery 's reputation by putting it into cheap shoes , will sell the material for a considerably higher price than the 40 to 80 per sq . ft. for leather . Though Arnav could profitably sell its children 's shoes for $3 , it will charge $5-.5 . <P> Not Married . Du Pont salesmen have taken samples of their material to more than 100 shoe manufacturing plants , have found shoemakers so interested in the new material , says a Du Pont executive , that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not married to leather , " says President Samuel Slosberg of Boston 's Green Shoe Manufacturing Co . " If the consumer goes for this new stuff , so will we . "
