Even at the painful cost of $200 million a year to its balance of payments , Britain has long accepted its role as one of the world 's foremost aluminum importers . The high price of the electric power required for aluminum smelting has kept British manufacturing down to an insignificant annual 39,000 short tons of ingots , less than 10% of the country 's needs . <P> Soon this is going to change . After years of dawdling , the Labor government finally announced its plan to help set up a domestic aluminum industry . British Aluminium Co. . ( partly owned by Reynolds Metals of the U.S. ) and the British mining concern , Rio Tinto-Zinc Corp. , received the go-ahead to build two smelting plants . They are expected to produce an annual 224,000 tons of ingots by 1971 and save $100 million a year on imports . <P> Cheap Power . Key to the state-sponsored scheme is a special deal to pro vide the plants with cheap power . Each company will build its own smelter and invest jointly with the government in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $149 million to cover the investment in the power stations and will charge the companies special low rates for the electricity they use . <P> Rio Tinto will build its 112,000-ton smelter on the Welsh island of Anglesey at Holyhead . As the " buying-in " price for a cheap power deal , it will in vest $79 million in the new Dungeness nuclear-power station in Kent . British Aluminium got the coveted site at Invergordon in the Highlands , the last undeveloped deep-water port in the United Kingdom . Its 112,000-ton smelter there will be fueled at the cheap rate in return for a $70 million investment . <P> Six years from now the new plants , plus the increased smelting capacity of Alcan Aluminium Ltd. , should be able to put 348,000 short tons of ingots on the market annually , but some analysts are predicting an aluminum glut before then . Sir Val Duncan , chairman of Rio Tinto , disagrees . " If you look at it globally , that must be nonsense , " he says . <P> " The world increase in aluminum demand is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That means some 360,000 tons of new capacity of aluminum must be found every year . " <P> Nevertheless , marketing patterns are bound to change as British producers gradually meet most of the domestic needs . Industry leaders are looking forward to shedding their dependence on foreign producers . The biggest potential loser : Norway , which now sells a third of its aluminum ingot exports in Britain , duty-free .
