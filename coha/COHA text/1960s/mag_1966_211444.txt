Canada owes its prosperity in great part to American investment , but " creeping continentalism " - as some Canadians sneeringly call their country 's close economic ties with the U.S. - is for many a matter of national pride and politics . An overdose of both ele ments has escalated a dispute which in volves U.S. banking beyond any neigh borly squabble . <P> Canada 's target is the Mercantile Bank of Canada ( assets : $225 million ) , which , as smallest by far of the country 's eight nationally chartered banks , would hardly be noticed were it not wholly owned by New York 's First Na tional City Bank . In Ottawa last week , parliamentary hearings began on a bill designed to limit the size of banks in which non-Canadians have more than a 25% interest . Mercantile , as it happens , would be the only one affected ; under the new rules , it would be forced to pare its assets to $200 million or find new Canadian owners . <P> In pushing the bill , Finance Minister Mitchell Sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage would build Sharp 's Liberal Party strength , polish his chances of one day succeeding Prime Minister Les ter Pearson as party chief . As a result , Mercantile , which had existed for ten years under Dutch ownership before Citibank bought it in 1963 , is now a bank to be bullied . <P> The U.S. is angered at the bill 's punitive tone and retroactive nature ; it is also fearful of the precedent the measure could set in other countries where U.S. banks operate . Snapped one U.S. <P> official last week : " You do n't change the rules of the game during the game . " <P> Hoping to cool the nationalistic temper surrounding the bill , the State Department issued a strong formal protest ; it reminded Canada that its own huge banking interests in the U.S. - including about half the lucrative Wall Street call-loan market - amount to some $1.6 bil lion and hinted at possible reprisal . The note did not find a welcome . When one high-ranking U.S. diplomat explained the U.S. position in Ottawa , he was told , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Liberal government seems in a mood to push on with the bill , to the astonishment of many Canadians . Montreal Gazette Business Columnist John Meyer called the bill " quite inexcusable " and warned that " the implications of this for other foreign investors are absolutely frightening . " At the hearings , Bank of Montreal Chairman G. Arnold Hart protested that " such an arbitrary and discriminatory " act could only " lay us open to retaliation . " Possibly so . If the bill passes , the next U.S. Congress will probably act on a measure , sponsored by New York 's Republican Sena tor Jacob Javits , that provides tit-for-tat treatment for countries where U.S. banks are unfairly hampered.
