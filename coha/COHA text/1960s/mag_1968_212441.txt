Director Marco Bellocchio 's family name means " beautiful eye " - and European cinema buffs are satisfied that it is a highly suitable patronym . On the basis of only two films , they are already hailing Bellocchio as Italy 's brightest movie light since Antonioni . The 28-year-old son of a lawyer from Piacenza , Bellocchio won the Silver Ribbon , Italy 's Oscar , with his very first effort , Fists in the Pocket ( 1965 ) . His China Is Near ( 1966 ) won the special jury award at last summer 's Ven ice Film Festival . Both films are now being released in the U.S. <P> Bellocchio put up most of the mon ey for Fists in the Pocket himself , cast it with friends and beginners willing to take a chance , and shot it at a villa that belonged to his mother . The stark , Faulknerian story of Fists in the Pocket is so gruesome that it often seems faintly ridiculous . In a decaying country house lives a blind woman with two epileptic teen-age sons and a neurotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job in a nearby town and wishes he could afford to get married . It looks as if his restrictive responsibilities may be over at last when his brother Alessandro loads the rest of the family in a car and sets out to drive them all over a cliff . At the last minute he chickens out , but he eventually manages to shove his mother over the cliff , and drown his epileptic brother . He is about to do in his pretty sister as well , when he is stopped by a violent paroxysm . <P> The frustrated rage and alienation of adolescence is the real point and power of Fists . Bellocchio , who wrote his own script , may have personally identified with Alessandro 's rampage , but he keeps his distance ; the film has the detached quality of a series of animated tableaux . The actors however perform with great competence-especially Lou Castel as the matri-fratricide , Paola Pitagora as his sister , and Ciliana Gerace as the mother . The tableaux are often visually stunning , in the best tradition of Italian neorealism : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat steals food from the blind mother 's plate , the seedy despair of rooms where beds are never made , the solemn revelry of a dance in town . <P> Graffiti &; Time Bombs . In China Is Near , Bellocchio abandons adolescent hostility for political disdain ; the film makes fun of the full range of Italian leftist politics , from the filo-cinese ( the sinophiles of the left ) to the moderate Socialists , with their progressive pretensions and bourgeois attachments . China 's political satire kicked up a furor in Italy . But U.S. audiences are likely to be more amused than annoyed by this story about a rich , bumbling professor who campaigns for local office as a Socialist , while his equally ridiculous Maoist brother harasses him and his colleagues with graffiti , time bombs and police dogs . <P> Everyone is depicted as compromising public ideals for private advantage , and the satire is often obscure and heavyhanded . Yet , as in Fists , there is visual evidence that the director has an unerring flair for the camera , which watches the proceedings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first two movies inspire high hopes that next time this promising young moviemaker will supply himself with better material .
