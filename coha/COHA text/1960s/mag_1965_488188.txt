" Mississippi has changed from a reality to an abstraction , " said Cur-A 's Hayes , who was McComb Project director last summer . Not that there still is n't plenty of nonabstract hunger and bombs and suffering . But to someone comparing the feel of summer 1964 with the present , this made sense . Mississippi today seems less a battleground " between good and evil , and more a labyrinth where none of the possible paths is a sure way out . It has become fashionable and squabbled-over , almost like Africa in the 19th century . Politicking has nearly outmoded heroism , and the symbol of the Philadelphia martyrs has given way to a huge , curling question mark . A host of new forces is now operating in the state , with LBJ humming We Shall Overcome in the background . The federal government came into the picture this past summer with a million dollars for Operation Headstart , an anti-poverty program to prepare underprivileged children ( mostly Negro ) for primary school . At about the same time , the National Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by helping to set up the Mississippi Democratic Conference with Negro leaders unsympathetic to the MFDP , plus liberal white Mississippians . On the junior level , a successful Elizabeth Sutherland , editor of Letters from Mississippi ( McGraw-Hill ) traveled recently in Mississippi , Louisiana , Alabama and Tennessee . She directs the office of the Student Nonviolent Cool dinating Committee in New York . 212 fight has been waged to prevent the charter of the Young Democratic Club from falling into the hands of a new , integrated group allied to the MFDP . , The National Council of Churches ( NCC ) set up a new division , the Delta Ministry , working in two areas . The ministry was conceived last year , with the idea of improving economic conditions in Mississippi . At one point it was considered a means of containing what some considered the overly radical , anti-compromise influence of MFDP and SNCC . This year , the Delta Ministry has spent most of its resources aiding the cotton choppers and tractor drivers of the new Freedom Labor Union who struck for higher wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mt . Beulah Conference Center , located in the small town of Edwards about 20 miles from Jackson . The Mt . Beulah campus has been the focus of activity for a surprising variety of organizations . It has served as headquarters for Operation Headstart and has also been host to meetings of the MFDP , whose Congressional challenge the NCC has supported . At one point , Washington ordered Headstart moved to an area less contaminated by the civil rights movement , Headstart 's staff threatened to resign en masse , and the program stayed at Mt . Beulah . Meanwhile , white Mississippi changed some but not all of its bad habits . Outside the front entrance to the Pamla County Clinic , in the northern part of the State , a stack of discarded signs lies on the porch floor . They say " White Entrance " and " Colored Entrance , " and it was good to see them gathering dust in the sunlight , In Jackson , an interracial couple told of shopping in a white supermarket without harassment or hostile stares , whites even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that same week a white Jackson minister was shot for the mildest of civil rights activity . In Gulfport , on the tourist coast , a Negro assigned to test restaurants complained of so much compliance that he had had to eat seventeen full dinners in one day , but another Negro was refused service and almost beaten up when he ordered a hamburger . Among " responsible " whites , the prevalent attitude seemed to be that expressed in a sign at a drive-in ; it had read The NATION PRIVATELY OWNED BUSINESS ? WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE SERVICE TO ANYONE but was bitterly scrawled over to say ONCE WAS A PRIVATELY OWNED BU SINE 5 S ? WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO REFUSE SERVICE TO ANYONE . Up in Cleveland , Miss. , the Holiday Inn motel gave a room without question to two women , one of them Negro , when they arrived at night . At breakfast , however , the manager came to their table before they had ordered and demanded immediate payment for a long-distance call completed only five minutes earlier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for particular people " ? but said he did not mean Negroes , he meant " single women . " When the women refused to pay at once , he moved to call the police His anguished Southern soul had compelled him to indulge in harassment  --  but with a sharp eye on what was now legal . Thus Mississippi finds itself gripped by the confusion and tension of new forces at work . Daily life is not improved ; the " new South " is still almost invisible . In the counties where there are federal registrars ( nine out of eighty-two ) voter registration has generally gone well , but how much will that change ? As with school integration , the burden is on the Negro to go register  --  and risk his child 's neck or his own . Civil rights workers feel frustrated . The extreme danger which often bound them together in 1964 is lacking now ; security systems have dissolved . At the same time , a number of local NegroeS have died under sinister circumstances , but the Justice Department says it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In this atmosphere of fragmented reality , the movement searches for a grip on the future . Beginning last March , cotton choppers went on strike in a succession of delta areas , seeking $1 25 an hour instead of the standard $3 for a 10-to-12-hour day . Tractor drivers demanded raises from $5 to $12 per day . The decision to strike was sometimes taken at a meeting ( but rarely , if ever ; by formal vote ) ; sometimes a group would simply not show up for work and others would then join them Strikes have failed because adequate measures were not taken to supply the participants ' needs . But the idea spread October 11 , 1965 quickly from the delta to McComb , where Holiday Inn maids making 39c an hour walked out ( to be replaced by others at the same wage ) , and to other states . The birth of the Mississippi Freedom Labor Union caught the imagination of Americans everywhere who had always felt that the vote was no cure-all . There are two versions of how it all started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the strikes originated in the small settlement of Tribbett when he went there with gifts to distribute last Christmas and found the people had not been reached by civil rights workers . They began to talk and out of this came the decision of several tractor drivers to strike . But according to George Shelton , state president of the MFLU , the strike began on the Seligmann plantation near the small , depressed town of Shaw . A Freedom School class had finished reading Howard Fast 's Freedom Road , and began to talk about what could be done to improve their living conditions . A number of cotton choppers then struck . At one point , 1,000 to 3,000 persons were not working . Today in Tribbett , five large tents with wooden floors stand in a field behind a little store ; these are to house the eight families thrown off their land who form the hard core of strikers there . A sign nearby proclaims STRIKE CITY ? LOCAL No. 4 , MFLU . No one seems to know why this is No 4 , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encampment has clearly been readied for a long siege . A total of 300 workers intend to stay on strike through the , winter and an all-out effort is planned for the spring . The grim truth is that by 1966 many choppers will probably have been made obsolete by chemical spraying , and many pickers by machines . " The whole delta would strike tomorrow , " said a SNCC worker in Shaw , " if they knew there would be something to eat . But they do n't . " Although small increases have been granted in some areas , the MFLU demand for $1.25 an hour instead , of $3 a day is hopeless if human hands are no longer needed . For this reason , some people in the movement believe that the issue is not wages but land ownership . Curtis Hayes , a former SNCC staffer , is ' investigating the possibility of buying a large chunk of plantation land with the aid of a government grant and setting up a communal operation based on an Israeli model . Sharecroppers thrown off their land for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business use . Hayes talks about raising half a million dollars privately , to be matched by a government grant . This kind of thinking may surprise people who have known SNCC , the pioneer organization in Mississippi , as distrustful of the federal government and suspicious of money which may have strings attached . But they overlook ' SNCC 's diversity of viewpoint and the experimental spirit - of many SNCC workers . The fact is that white Mississippi 213 has been driving the Negro out of the ; state . This has been going on for years , but now the pace seems to have accelerated . The radio carries a , stream of announcements about domestic jobs in the North . On the plantations , machines are pushing Negroes off the land . Last month , a more subtle way of forcing emigration emerged when school integration began , In Tallahatchie County , and a number of others , a Negro child who did not have at least one parent living in the state could not transfer to the formerly all-white public school this fall without paying " tuition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the hundreds , if not thousands , of children whose parents have moved to the North for better jobs , leaving their young with relatives . The relatives pay taxes , but no matter A child can be adopted , but when the relative goes to take out papers he finds that the fee runs around $100 The only choice left is to send the child to his parents or have him continue at the Negro public school But here comes the final twist : if the child is not living with a parent or legal guardian , he must now pay tuition to attend the Negro school ! Such fees run from $100 to $275 in Amite County , a rural area where good jobs are hard to find and adults often leave for work elsewhere . They ? may send money to support their children , but they can not afford such tuition fees . Thus the white authorities penalize the Negro child and drive Negroes from the state . The more who leave , the less trouble for the whites  --  and a lot can leave before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negro 's economic situation is desperate ; new jobs must be created , sustenance provided . And so the black Mississippians talk more about getting jobs with Operation Headstart than about voting , All across the state , people grasp for ways to create work that pays and ways to get more for their work . A new okra cooperative in Batesville ( the only legal co-ops in Mississippi are agricultural ) aims to cut out the white middleman , a new sewing firm has sprung up in . Canton , another in Indianola . This is not an entirely new development ; Ruleville has had a quilting group for several years . But the proliferation is new as is the Poor People 's Corporation which aims to help establish such enterprises . Jesse Morris , a SNCC staffer , set up the corporation last spring . It conducted a training program during the summer at Mt . Beulah where , because of limited funds ( raised privately ) ; training was restricted to three skills . On August 29 , the corporation held its first meeting . Members came together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okra cooperative , the Canton sewing firm , the three new firms which will make leather and suede handbags , belts , pouches , as a result of summer training Softly and sometimes inarticulately , spokesmen talked of their enterprises and asked for grants of $400 , $1,000 ? nothing very large . They passed around sample goods while members of the audience asked detailed questions about production and marketing . It was easy to invoke nightmare visions of bad management and laughable bookkeeping , but people were going to learn by doing , and that was something the white boss had , never encouraged . Another new project , also with its base at Mt . Beulah , is the Freedom Now Brick Company , conceived by SNCC worker Frank Smith . The purpose of the company is to provide housing for Negroes kicked off the land . The company 's function is to be three-pronged. a foundation will be set up to extend the necessary funds , a factory is privately , with hopes for a supplemental loan from the Small Business Administration . The company 's board of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businesses of the Poor , People 's Corporation , It plans to sell 15,000 shares of preferred stock at $10 a share and 5,000 shares of voting stock at $1 a share . When he went to open a bank account for the brick company 's development fund , Frank Smith was asked by the teller : " Are you the president of the company ? " Smith had been an outspoken foe of " leadership " and excessive structure within SNCC , but , this time he simply said " yes . " The game had changed ; you ca n't fight bankdom if you 're going to start a company . Perhaps none of these enterprises will get off the ground . And even if they do , the dent in Mississippi'spoverty will be slight . They - may , " however , compel other , richer and more powerful agencies to take steps . The Delta Ministry has already announced the formation of the Delta Opportunity Corporation , which would seek federal assistance on economic development , jobs and housing for ten counties . The Delta contains Mississippi 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem can truly be solved only by massive federal action . Meanwhile , some of the civil rights people have recognized the need to attack economic problems and to utilize federal money where possible . SNCC workers , for example , can help get government grants to those who need them most by providing the necessary information and contacts , It may not quite be possible " to radicalize the 0E0 ( Office of Economic Opportunity ) , " as an MFDP worker in Jackson put it , but it is n't necessary to assume that the movement will be bought off if federal money is used In any case , the movement ca n't compete with $1 million . A Freedom School ca n't compete with a Headstart School . In the past , too many civil rights workers ? particularly middle-class Northerners , both Negro and white ? have sought to impose their justified alienation , from American ? ma-terialism upon Southern Negroes who just do n't know what they are talking about . To a sharecropper 's wife with eleven hungry kids , a pair of shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a love of freedom so deep that it will abide with her through both trials and satisfactions of the flesh . Most of the economic developments mentioned here , particularly the Mississippi Freedom Labor Union , would not have come about without the 1964 ' Summer Project and the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party . Both catalyzed the strength and desire of black men to speak out , to do something about their deprivation . The MFDP does not yet have a unified state program of action on local issues . It has concentrated its attention this year on the Congressional challenge to unseat the five Mississippians . To many Negroes , it is therefore a structure of leaders and little more : the complexities of political struggle in Washington are remote , baffling . When there has been political action on a local issue , it has sometimes been taken in the name of the MFDP , sometimes not People set up voting leagues or " improvement associations " without including the Freedom Party in their names . Some counties have frequent MFDP meetings , others do not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it is hard to imagine the party existing otherwise . Some day this may have to change ? for example , when the MFDP runs candidates for state office in 1966 , as it now plans to do . The Challenge has been dismissed by a vote of 228 to 152 , but not without shaking up Congress and white Mississippi . MFDP feels that was only the beginning . The MFDP has been unable to fill the vacuum created by the demise of the Council of Federated Organizations last winter . In the summer of 1964 , there were thirty-odd COFO projects around the state , serviced by SNCC or CORE personnel and funds , plus 650 volunteers who had usually gone through a week of well-planned orientation . In the summer , of 1965 , SNCC agreed to recruit volunteers on the basis of needs to be specified by the MFDP county committees . Most of the volunteers were supposed to bring with them specific skills , not just their white bodies , and the MFDP was to orient them . It did n't work . This past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last minute amid great confusion . Few of them had the skills specified and no one seemed to know where they should be assigned to work . Orientation was cut short by the emergency in Jackson : the new workers went there to join the mass demonstrations and were thus oriented in jail . The volunteers seemed to me often of a poorer quality than last year 's ; less inspired , more frustrated . In fairness to the MFDP , it should be said that SCOPE 's summer workers in Alabama ? recruited by the Southern Leadership Conference ? seemed no better off Their orientation had been orderly but abstract ; they learned some Negro history , little about what to do when beaten or jailed . In any case , the time for massive numbers of white volunteers has passed . Also gone from Mississippi this year is Robert Parris Moses , director of the 1964 project . Having dropped his last name in an effort to break the hero worship and leadership role he had acquired , Parris worked this year on a new approach to Mississippi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Nation , July 19 . He acknowledges the importance to the Negro of material well-being , and the effect this can have on his political behavior . He believes that if the grass-roots movement is to retain its vitality and keep on pushing for change to benefit not merely the teacher but also the sharecropper , that movement must gain strength by hooking up with other protest groups around the country . These include elements of the peace ' movement , the student movement , the civil rights move ment and Community organizations such as the Students for a Democratic Society project in Newark . An attempt at bringing them together was the Assembly of Unrepresented People in Washington , August 6-9 , which held workshops and declared peace in Vietnam . George Shelton , president of the MFLU , was there from Shaw , as were the two young men from McComb who created a furor with their flier urging Negroes not to serve , in Vietnam . " We talked to a lot of people in McComb about the idea before we put out the flier , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So we did it . " Across Mississippi and outside it , people grope for answers . Ask a SNCC worker where the movement should go and he will usually say , " I do n't know , " Ask an LCDC lawyer about the dynamics of change and he will see no solution within our system as we know it . Ask a sharecropper like Mrs. Miller , in her delta shack . Mrs. Miller decided to send all seven of her school-age children to the white school in town this fall . Her home was shot into shortly after she registered them . Their going to school means the loss of seven cotton pickers , and that much less food . The planter has already indicated his displeasure , and she and her family will probably be thrown off the land . Mrs. Miller knows every corner of her trap . She should be brought to Washington , to testify about economic oppression , in the same way that Negroes have come before to tell of political oppression . If the government listened and acted , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So Mrs. Miller does n't know the answer either . Meanwhile , Negroes from Mississippi continue to go north in search of some small improvement . They go to Watts , and Watts will be repeated . Northern liberals may be appalled to learn that Los Angeles gave a certain satisfaction to the nonviolent Negro of Mississippi . He regretted the toll of black lives ; he sympathized with the spirit of insurrection . He too has been on the verge of armed " riot " ? in Greenwood last year , in Natchez this year when an NAACP worker 's car was booby-trapped . For today he feels , simultaneously , the hope of change and the depth of racism in this country .
