txt Paul W. Kayser and Darrell Grisham are successful businessmen and officials ? of the National Alliance of Businessmen . There the comparison ends . Mr. Kayser is white , vice president of a large corporation , Pepsico , and is executive vice chairman of the National Alliance . Mr. Grisham is black , president of a small company , the Parker House Sausage Company in Chicago , and is on the board of the Chicago Alliance of Businessmen , the local branch of the N.A.B. Although they . are both working toward the goals of the alliance , their views on what it ought to be clash sharply , and in this respect they represent two sides of a broader controversy that is emerging around the country between N.A.B. administrators and critics in the cities who object to the way the program has been operated . The alliance %. vc formed in January , 1968 , as a partnership between business and Government intended to find , train and hire the hardcore jobless in the ghettos through a program called Job Opportunities in the Business Sector . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founding , it has reported 338,275 job pledges and 268,920 persons placed in jobs . The ' criticism comes from whites as well as blacks , from bureaucrats and businessmen as well as members of civil rights organizations , in such places as Chicago , Detroit and Birmingham . It focuses partly on the N.A.B. 's claims of success in reducing ghetto unemployment . The critics point out that 126,047 or something less than half of those placed have left the jobs , leaving 142,873 still working . Normal turnover in industry is about 35 per cent . The critics also complain that blacks are not given a big enough voice in the venture , and that too many of the jobs are low-level with // few promotional opportunities . The alliance 's program . is divided Into two areas . The first is a drive to enlist businessmen to pledge jobs to the hard-core jobless . The other is a contract program in which businesses are reimbursed by the Department of Labor for the cost of training and other expenses for handling problems associated with the unemployed , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out $300-million in reimbursements . While more and more companies elect to participate in the contract program , most still prefer to do their own recruiting and skip the Government subsidy . Officials reported that of 70,000 companies in the total one-fourth make use of the contracts . Officials explained that most companies fear Government interference , while many just agree with the critics that they should not be reimbursed for such job categories as porters and maids . Questions with racial overtones arose almost from the beginning , though they are viewed differently by the black and white staff members of N.A.B. and others supporting the organization , such as the Urban League , who were interviewed in person or reached by telephone in several cities . Many See a Race Problem To Mr. Grisham as to other blacks , the - alliance has a race problem . To Mr. Kayser , the only black problem is that of finding jobs for the disadvantaged , most of whom happen to be black . As a matter of fact , he was concerned that the alliance was considered a black organization . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kayser said . " It 's for the disadvantaged , whomever they they might be . " Negroes were sensitive to such things as the lack of black professional staffers on N.A.B. Most staff members are on loan from companies , and in city after city those persons were white . Mr. Grisham and other blacks were concerned that Negroes were not " getting a piece of the action " as consultants on the problems that affect Negroes . " There just is n't any thought given to such things as these by the whites who run N.A.B. " one black job expert said . " It might not be that they are consciously doing it , but it has been so natural for so long to not have blacks involved that no thought is given to it . " However , to Mr. Grisham and other Negroes interviewed , race is tied to other factors that they feel are simply overlooked by the predominantly white staffs of the alliance . These include participation of black companies as employers and consultants , and Negroes as staff members . They also see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their parent agency , the Manpower Administration , on the one side , and Concentrated Employment Programs on the other over which is best qualified to find jobs for the poor . aConcentrated Employment Programs have offices in ghetto areas , are jointly run by the Labor Department and the Office of Economic Opportunity , and seek to place the chronically unemployed in jobs . Mr. Grisham complained that black companies were only recently awarded contracts to train the poor , and mostly in larger cities . A check in smaller cities such as Buffalo , San Antonio , Birmingham and Columbus and Dayton , Ohio , found no black companies participating " In the beginning the black community in Chicago knew nothing about contracts , " Mr. Grisham said . Mr. Kayser and some local alliance members said they had never paid much attention to directing their effort to Negro companies in pushing the availability of contracts . " I was just selling the contract idea , trying to get the word out that they were available , " Mr. Kayser stated . Negroes were also worried about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keith , job specialist for the Birmingham Urban League , said : " The jobs are not usually as good as we expect . " A Washington manpower expert said : " We screen out low level jobs . Sometimes we do n't even-have to tell the employers ? they get the message that we want good jobs . " Meaningful Jobs Sought Negroes and some N.A.B. members have complained that the Labor Department provides reimbursement for training for such jobs as busboy , porter , maid , parking lot attendant , housekeeper , laborer and airlines baggagemen . The critics agree that there is no place to go but up in those jobs , but they say they can not understand what training would be needed for them and they think companies should not get money for them . However , most N.A.B. officials see nothing wrong with such jobs . " There is nothing wrong with a $1.60 an hour job , so long as it leads someplace , " Mr. Kayser said . " I would certainly not discourage such jobs where efforts are made to make certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than no job at all . " Low level placements that offered no chance for advancement have resulted in the formation of an organization and protest actions in Birmingham , according to Ray Someral , director of-the Concentrated Employment Program in the northern Alabama City . He said that the Poor People 's Action Committee was organized by former trainees of N.A.B. , mostly women . He said his and other employment agencies were currently trying to put the people to work . Mr. Someral described the situation this way : " Enrollees had been very frustrated and very critical of N.A.B. jobs , so . they formesd this committee . They were upset because they had been trained for menial jobs in the first place , but then they got angry when they felt they did n't have ample opportunity to move upward . " Some companies made the commitments under the contract , put the people in the program and got the money for it , but then discovered they did n't have the job openings they promised or the upward mobility they promised , particularly for woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems here ; it trains big groups of women but there just are n't the jobs for them and the quality of job for those who are placed is bad . " The Battelle Institute in Columbus , Ohio , conducted a study that the institute said showed further polarization of blacks participating in alliance programs because false hopes of good jobs with promotional opportunities had been raised but not fulfilled . Charles Lazarus , chairman of the alliance branch in Columbus and president of Lazarus Department Store , said the study worried him . " At Lazarus , as a result , we were very interested in promotions and pay incentives for the trainees , " Mr. Lazarus said . " This should have been a concern of national N.A.B. , at least I thought so . So I took the man who conducted the study and another associate to Washington to personally deliver the study . National N.A.B. could have cared less . " Malcolm R. Lovell Jr. , United States manpower administrator , whose agency approves the contracts for the jobs , feels reimbursement for low-level jobs is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advancement . " We are not opposed to those jobs if they pay a decent wage , " he said . " If the Government is going to invest money , the job must be worth the training . We will not encourage poverty wages . " New Look at Standards Ron Durbin of the Chicago alliance sees low level jobs as a way to get a " foot in the door " of many businesses . He said quite a few businessmen still did not accept the N.A.B. " We feel we have caused a lot of them to take a new look at their job standards and qualifications , " Mr. Durbin said . " Many of them are hiring people they would not have considered hiring two years ago . This is good . " Mr. Grisham has an idea that he feels would greatly enhance the alliance and improve its program . He said white businesses had not taken advantage of the experiences of black businessmen and he had urged President Nixon to call a conference of 100 of the top black business leaders . " Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " After all we 've been hiring the hardcore since we 've been business* men . It 's ironic that they white businessmen are out trying to learn from each other about hiring the disadvantaged ' We could at least shove them how to get the brother'to come to work on Monday , , ' to not cuss out his supervisor and to be a good employe . " Statistics Questioned The major problem with alliance programs is that very little can be double-checked . Thus if the alliance says 268 , - 920 persons have , been placed in jobs or if a businessman says he has hired 50 disadvantaged persons , there is no precise means of confirmation . Mr. Kayser said the alliance was in the process of establishing a monitoring system using employers ' Social Security numbers . He said the numbers would be checked to follow through on workers placed to see if they were still on the job and how far they had gone . Local alliances are often caught up in the conflict between the Concentrated Employment Program and state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Concentrated Employment Program will be ' brought under the control of the state agencies . Some local Concentrated Employment Pro ' - grams are vigorously fighting the change . Another concern expressed by a few local alliance officials : was loss of enthusiasm by the top local businessmen . The all ' : ance has a provision whereby ' the leadership is changed annually , but in some cities the leadership has slipped from senior executives to junior executives .
