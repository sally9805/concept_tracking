Spiritually speaking , the Roman Catholic student at Notre Dame or Georgetown has it made . His campus is studded with chapels ; hundreds of priests are available to hear his confession or try to resolve his doubts over a cup of coffee after class . In contrast , for thousands of Catholic students on secular campuses , the only source of spiritual help is likely to be the overworked chaplain of the school 's Newman Club , an institution better known for tea dances than theology . <P> A promising third way is being explored in Pittsburgh . There the 8,000 Catholic students who attend Pitt , Carnegie Tech and all-girl Chatham College are served by what the city 's theology-minded Bishop John J. Wright calls " a Newman Club in depth . " This is the two-year-old Pittsburgh Oratory , a highbrow study center staffed by priests who follow the rule of prayer and discipline laid down by Florence 's St. Philip Neri in the 16th century . <P> Located midway between the Pitt and Carnegie Tech campuses , the Oratory , unlike most Newman Clubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by promoting a score of social activities . It offers only spiritual and intellectual help . Mass is celebrated daily at Carnegie Tech and at Pitt 's handsomely Gothic Heinz Memorial Chapel . At least one of the Oratory 's four priests-Bishop Wright hopes eventually to build a staff of twelve clerical specialists in different intellectual fields-is available 24 hours daily to handle any student questions that arise-on morality , eschatology , or obedience . <P> Every evening the Oratory offers a class or seminar on such subjects as modern Biblical criticism or the psychology of religious experience , often using texts by avant-garde theologians-Austria 's Karl Rahner , or France 's Henri de Lubac . The creditless courses are well attended , do much to resolve conflicts between dogma and science for students . One Oratory student recalls how he was stunned by his discovery of experiments in modern genetics that offer man the distant prospect of creating life . " But I consulted one of the priests here , " he says , " and I discovered that there is no dogmatic denial of the possibility of spontaneous generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is precisely what the Oratory hopes to do . " Our job , " says the center 's director , Father Philip Walsh , " is to see that faith , far from shackling reason , actually frees it , opening up new dimensions of reality which reason unaided by faith is incapable of knowing .
