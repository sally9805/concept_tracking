The most enjoyable way of becoming an instant expert on the forthcoming waterfowl hunting season in the U.S. is to peek , and one of the best views is to be found at Tom Wheeler 's Cabbage Willows Camp on James Bay , Quebec . // There , where shooting began this year on Sept. 11 and closed with the first snows Oct. 13  --  at least a month earlier than in the U.S.  --  hunting was spectacular , with strong indications that the 1969 season farther south may well be the best in 10 years . // Millions of snow geese , blues and Canadas move south from Arctic breeding grounds to the marshes along James Bay and , for a few brief weeks of autumn , rest among the cattails and bulrushes at Cabbage Willows , fattening themselves on salt grasses , sedges and herbs . For centuries the Cree Indians knew about this part of James Bay , but they kept the secret to themselves . Each fall small bands of Indians would move by canoe from their villages at Moosonee and Rupert House to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter they harvested enough geese to feed themselves until spring . It was not until 1945 that the white man discovered this Indian hunting ground , and even today few white men have hunted there . // It is not an easy place to reach . The road north ends at Matagami , some 140 air miles away , and flights from there depend upon the whims of weather . Of a dozen shooting camps on James Bay , the oldest and best is Wheeler 's at Cabbage Willows . A pioneer in aviation and wilderness exploration , Wheeler made his early bush flights into northern Quebec with one sportsman 's eye focused on where the hunting and fishing looked best . He opened his camp 24 years ago when he obtained a long-term lease from the provincial government on 32 square miles of marsh  --  20,000 acres of the choicest waterfowl resting and feeding grounds . The original camp has grown over the years into unexpectedly luxurious quarters for an area so remote . From the air the double cluster of buildings , one on either side of a tributary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance of a small community . Some 15 Cree Indians with their wives and children live in the southerly buildings . // Across the tributary , which is spanned by a narrow footbridge , sits the main building with its bunkrooms , each sleeping six , comfortable lounge , bar , dining room and kitchen and several additional cabins and storerooms . Every building is insulated , heated and electrically lighted . The meals are feasts usually begun with such appetizers as escargots and smoked sturgeon , and the wine at dinner is served in crystal . // In addition to Cabbage Willows and his main Lac Ouimet Club 80 miles north of Montreal at St. Jovite , Tom Wheeler operates three fishing camps : Finger Lake in Ungava , where during the July-August season anglers take Arctic char to 28 pounds and lake trout to 40 ; and Lac Repos and Lac La Carpe camps north of St. Jovite , from which anglers fish for speckled and lake trout in 35-odd lakes accessible only by air . // The standards , the style and the sport at all Wheeler camps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his clients are repeat business . Considering this , the rates are a bargain . A three-day shoot at Cabbage Willows , plus a day at each end getting there , costs $530 and includes everything from arrival at Montreal to departure : bar-equipped limousine from and to the airport , pre- and posthunt accommodations at Lac Ouimet Club , transportation by land cruiser and floatplane to and from James Bay , food , lodging , liquor , ammunition , licenses , Indian guides , canoes , outboard motors , waterproof clothing , hip boots , gratuities , and even such personal items as long Johns , socks and a gun , should a hunter come without them . // The flight from Matagami to camp takes an hour and 20 minutes in normal weather , but it must be timed to the high tide and there is little margin for delay . Once in camp , the hunters are similarly dependent upon tides , since the canoes can navigate the two miles or so of river to the hunting grounds only when the water is high . Then they must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tides vary during the season , shooting parties often leave camp before dawn , stopping on the way to gather willows for blinds . // Near the river 's mouth the boats move away from the broad water , following a network of streams deep into the marsh . There the Indians moor the boats and , two Indians to each pair of hunters , head out on foot . Finally the Indians stop . They stick the willows into the ground , fashioning a circular blind , shoulder high , four feet in diameter . Then they move to a pool a dozen feet away . With paddles they scoop up mud , shaping and smoothing it into mounds with their hands . They pull handkerchief-size white rags from the canvas bags and place them carefully over each mound of mud . They put other rags over bent willows and plant these , too , in the mud . // Soon there are perhaps a dozen mud and willow decoys that look nothing like geese , but the Indians seem satisfied . They move beyond the decoys to a clump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is falling and the sky has turned from black to gray . Then , suddenly , the birds begin to fly . They appear on the horizon in V-shaped wedges , honking and gaggling and shrieking . From the bushes the Indians call back , their voices rising higher as the geese answer . A flock of birds passes over the decoys , swings around and circles back . // " Shoot ! Shoot ! " the Indians shout . // The birds barely clear the blind , swooping over the hunters ' heads from behind . They are out of range in seconds . The hunters , caught off-guard , look dumbly after them . One of the Indians stands up and waves his arms . // " Turn around , " he calls . " Face other way ! " // Feeling foolish and inept , the hunters turn their backs to the decoys. // Another flock circles and comes back . This time the birds set their wings , gliding directly toward the blind . Together the hunters stand and fire . Three geese fall . The Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They prop up the geese with sticks , adding them to the bogus flock . // The birds come in now from all directions . By 7:45 there are nine real geese propped among the imposters at the blind . The limit is five per hunter per day . There is still one bird to go . // And then , as abruptly as their flight began , it stops . An occasional flight passes by , high and uninterested . An hour passes without a shot being fired . Then finally a flock approaches , lower than the others . It hesitates , studying the gathering below , then flies on . One goose separates from the flock . It is coming in , but high . At the blind it flares . The hunter fires . We have our limit . // It is 9 o'clock . There are still two hours to the next tide and a limit of ducks to be taken . The Indians gather the geese and boxes and bits of rags and we start back across the marsh to the boat . // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost as wide as the main river . Again they produce their bits of cloth , fashioning new decoys at the edge of the point . They are like the first ones and look no more like ducks than they did like geese . But in minutes a green-wing teal flies directly into them . Several more come by . There are no flocks of ducks this morning , only singles and pairs , but they come in steadily . // After a while another canoe comes along . It carries the Royal Canadian Mounted policeman who is stationed at Cabbage Willows for the shooting season . He exchanges pleasantries and warns that the tide will soon change and the wind will slow the trip back . The Indians again gather up birds and gear . The morning 's shoot is ended . // At camp there is a hot buttered rum for each hunter as he climbs up the bank from the boat . The Indians spread the birds on the wet grass , then pluck , dress and pack them in cold storage . They will scrub the hunter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil his gun in preparation for tomorrow 's hunt . And tomorrow 's hunt , like every hunt at Cabbage Willows , will be spectacular .
