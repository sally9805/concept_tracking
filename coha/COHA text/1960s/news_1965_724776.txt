txt A sheet of yellow , legal-size note paper bearing the handwritten inscription " Lindsay volunteers sign up here " was Scotch-taped to the wall of a hallway in the Roosevelt Hotel yesterday . At the far end of the hall , partly blocked by a desk and filled with political aides and telephone installation men , a door bore a photograph of Representative John V. Lindsay . In 12 rooms off the fourthfloor halt , about 25 volunteers answered hundreds of calls from others who wanted to help the Manhattan Republican in his efforts to win City Hall from Mayor Wagner . Pale green plaster fell to the carpeted floor as a telephone company workman drilled through a wall to lay , cable for a switchboard wired for 60 extensions and 15 trunk lines . The switchboard , with no number in its dial , stood disconnected amid a stack of cardboard cartons in one of the rooms . Hotel employes moved beds , sectional furniture and television sets out of the rooms . Others moved in tables , filing cabinets and desks .

She told him what she told all , the others : " We will call you in a couple of weeks . " Eager to Help " I 'm a Lindsay fan , " Mr. Birnbaum said later . He said he had voted for President Johnson but that he had missed " the youth and exuberance " of President Kennedy . Wearing sunglasses and a kerchief over her dark hair , Dolores Lamanna , 34 , filled out a card . She said she was a freelance writer and researcher and would do anything for Mr. Lindsay 's campaign from stuffing envelopes to working a sound truck . In a room behind the desk .
