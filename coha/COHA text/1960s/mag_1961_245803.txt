South Africa 's racist apartheid policy , he told the House of Commons , was a " tragically misguided and perverse philosophy . . . abhorrent to the ideals towards which mankind is struggling in this century . " Because of this stain on South Africa 's honor , said Macmillan , the South African flag should " now be flown at half-mast . " <P> Macmillan 's plain talk must have startled South African Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd , who arrived home from London prepared to boast about , not apologize for , leaving the Commonwealth . Verwoerd found many of his countrymen confused and uneasy .

What seemed to rankle most was Macmillan 's line about the South African flag . Actually , cried Verwoerd. the flag would only be at half-mast if " we had chosen self-destruction and mass suicide . " As it was , with South Africa established as an internationally isolated , white-dominated island in Black Africa , " the flag flies proud and free . " Shouted the government benches : " Hoor !
