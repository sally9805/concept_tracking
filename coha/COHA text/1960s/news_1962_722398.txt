txt LONDON , April 18 ? Warrants were issued today for the arrest of Donald D. Maclean and Guy Burgess , former British dipllomats who defected to the Soviet Union eleven years ago . They are expected to arrive in Britain tomorrow by plane from Moscow . No authentic ? explanation of their expected return was available . However , " reliable sources suggested that the return of the two former diplomats might be part of a Soviet move to obtain the release by Britain of Gordon Lonsdale , a Soviet spy who headed a ring that infiltrated the Portland naval base . The warrant issued for their arrest said there were grounds for supposing they " may be contemplating leaving or may have left " the Soviet Union . A spokesman of the British Embassy in Moscow said Wednesday that neither Burgess nor Maclean had applied for permission to travel to Britain , United Press International reported . He said the embassy had had no contact with the two defectors . Maclean and Burgess remained under Soviet protection tonight , adding another mystery to the many that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as counter-espionage agents were about to question them . Within the last forty-eight // hours , I. 5 , the British security service , heard , apparently through its overseas branch , M. I. 6 , that the two men were about to leave Moscow . Accordingly , Detective Inspector George Smith of Scotland Yard 's Special Branch applied for warrants for their arrest under the Official Secrets Act of 1911 . Soon afterward , British European Airways announced that Maclean and Burgess would be on a flight due to arrive at London Airport tonight from Moscow by way of Amsterdam . The Special Branch prepared to seize the two men when they left the plane . Later the airline announced that they were not aboard . Maclean , Government sources said , was still in his Moscow apartment and apparently concerned lest any news of his intended arrest in London reach his American-born wife , Melinda Marling Maclean . Burgess was reported to have been away from the Soviet capital for two weeks . Behind this tangled tale lies a cloak-and-dagger melodrama . One piece of the puzzle , British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted to a Soviet scientist and an electrician who had returned to the Soviet Union after having sought asylum in the Netherlands and Italy , respectively . The emphasis placed on that news conference by the Soviet Government apparently was intended to balance the effect in the Communist bloc of the return of Maclean and Burgess to Britain , officials said . Delay Laid to Bureaucracy Something evidently went amiss . What it was , no one in authority here would say . The best-informed speculation was that the vast machinery of the Soviet bureaucracy had stalled on the relatively simple administrative matter of granting exit visas to the two Britons . Of the two men , Burgess has been the most forthright in voicing a desire to return home . In 1959 , during Prime Minister Macmillan 's visit to Moscow , he told correspondents he wanted to visit his relatives and friends in Britain . Of the two men , Maclean is the more important . Like Burgess , he was well-born and welleducated . Unlike him , he had risen , despite doubts about his Communist inclinations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always al No. 2 man , while Maclean was clearly marked for the highest posts . Maclean had been a valued , member of the British missions in Washington and Cairo before , he became head of the Amercan Department in the Foreign Office . Burgess also had been , stationed in Washintgon . When 's he fled he was a minor Foreign Office official . Maclean , now 49 years old , has been employed on a number of jobs since his arrival in Moscow . One was editing a leading Soviet political magazine , International Affairs . He has also played a role , British sources said , in the formulation of Soviet policy on the Middle East . Burgess apparently , has been employed as a translator by the Soviet Foreign , Ministry . Maclean Still at Apartment MOSCOW , April 18 ( Reuters ) ? Donald D. Maclean was still in his apartment here tonight despite reports that he was flying to London . Earlier in the day , Maclean had told a reporter who called at his apartment that he had " absolutely nothing " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guy Burgess had been issued in London , " I do n't want to talk to you at all , " he said , and he added : " have asked you never to come and see me.
