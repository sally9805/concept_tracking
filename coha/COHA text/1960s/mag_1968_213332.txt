DO BUTLERS BURGLE BANKS ? by P. G. Wodehouse. 191 pages . Simon &; Schuster. $4.50 . <P> Which came first , P. G. Wodehouse or the English butler ? Wodehouse 's publishers confess they are not even certain whether he is 87 years old and has written a million books , or a million years old and has written 87 books . Anyhow the figures strain the imagination-but not more so than this potty tale about a bogus butler who sets out to burgle a Worcestershire bank . Connoisseurs of the old master 's brand of daffy brouhaha will savor it to the last page . For those who do n't trust any writer over 80-well , maybe they should sample a little vintage Wodehouse first , like a whiff of Carry On , Jeeves ! ( 1925 ) , or the tiniest dollop of Love Among the Chickens ( 1906 ) . <P> THE CONSTANT CIRCLE : H. L. Mencken and His Friends by Sara Mayfield . 307 pages . Delacorfe Press . $6.50 . <P> Sara Mayfield 's chatty account of " the Sage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Menckeniana . Miss Mayfield , an Alabamian who was a close friend of Mencken , is most revealing on Mencken the professional bachelor who finally gave in at the age of 49 and endorsed monogamy as " comfortable , laudable , and sanitary . " <P> Her admiring view of Mencken overlooks much in his work that was malicious . That is not hard to do , considering the Gargantuan proportions of his sense of fun . It is difficult to quibble about a man who , as an agnostic , prepared himself for the possibility of Judgment Day with the statement , " Gentlemen , I was wrong . "
