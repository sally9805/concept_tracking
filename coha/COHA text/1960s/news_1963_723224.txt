txt The House Ways and Means Committee tentatively rejected today President Kennedy 's proposal for repeal of special tax allowances on income from dividends . It was the second largest item of the many reforms in the Kennedy tax bill . The committee 's action , if upheld as the bill proceeds to final enactment , means that the taxrate on dividends will continue to be lower than that on other earnings . This advantage tends to favor persons with large incomes , inasmuch as they are the country 's biggest stockholders . The committee also acted on two other sections of the tax bill today  --  deductions for medical expenses and drugs , and deductions for the expenses of child care . In both cases the committee acted to liberalize the law . A Tentative Vote All of these actions are subject to reconsideration by the committee after it has gone through the bill item by item and has drafted the technical statutory language to fit its tentative decisions . It is possible that it will complete its tentative decisions on reform items this week . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , money that the Government does not get so long as the special allowances remain . The only larger item among the reforms is a proposed floor on itemized deductions , which the committee is expected to reject when it gets to it . The floor , which would allow such deductions only to the extent that they exceeded 5 per cent of income , would raise annual tax revenues by $2,300,000,000 . These two , dividends and itemized deductions , account for all but $600,000,000 of the $3,300-000,000 revenue-raising reforms that President Kennedy originally asked . Double Help The dividend allowance has two parts  --  a $50 exclusion and a 4 per cent credit . A person with dividends of $50 or less may simply exclude them when computing his income for tax purposes . This money is , in short , tax free . A person with more than $50 of dividends excludes the first $50 and gets special treatment on the rest . This permits him to subtract from his tax an amount equal to 4 per cent of any dividends over $50 . The credit and exclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eisenhower in , 1954 to encourage investment in stocks . The Eisenhower proposal rested on the long-standing view of business econOrnists that investment was hampered because corporate profits were taxed twice  --  first as profits , then as dividends . ' Democrats have sought repeal of these allowances ever since they became law . President Kennedy sought repeal in his 1961 tax bill , but the Ways and Means Committee refused even to consider it . Today 's defeat came in a vote on a compromise plan that would have killed the 4 per cent credit but retained the $50 exclusion . The vote was 14 to 11 . There was no vote on the Kennedy proposal as a whole , because it would have been defeated , too . On the medical - expense reforms , the committee took the following actions : flit rejected a Republican proposal to make health insurance premiums fully deductible for everyone who pays them . Sit rejected Kennedy proposals for a number of reforms that would have increased tax revenues , including a proposal , to lump together the existing 3 per cent floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor for drugs . int approved , for persons over 65 , an unlimited allowance for deducting drug expenses . This means that persons over 65 may deduct all they spend for drugs . Persons under 65 may do the same on drugs for dependent parents who are over 65 . Under present law , there is no deduction unless drug expenses exceed 1 per cent of income , and then the taxpayer may deduct only the excess . The committee 's action on child care was along lines that President Kennedy had proposed . The general purpose is relief for parents who must work and who must pay to have their children cared for while they work . The committee added one year to the age limit on children for whom child care deductions may be claimed  --  making it 13 years instead of 12 years . The committee also voted to permit a man to claim child care dedections if his wife is in an institution , instead of only if his wife is deceased . Also , the committee set a new and higher ? $900 ? ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more children , leaving the old $600 ceiling in effect in the case of one child .
