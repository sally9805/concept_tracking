Hello , Cyril ? This is your roommate Bonn . I have the most divine news . I mean , divine . You remember Modesty Blaisel And The Day the Fish Came Out ? Well , now there 's a raving new one called The Touchables , and it is absolutely not to be believed it 's so-so , well , divine . <P> There 's two gorgeous wrestlers , you see ? A white one , Ricki Starr , played by Ricki Starr . And a black one called Lillywhite-do n't you just love it ? Ricki wears red ballet slippers and pirouettes in the ring . And Lilly has these terrific pectorals and wears a mask like Batman . He kind of falls for this absolutely sumptuous rock-'n ' - roll singer , Christian , played by David Anthony . But before he can kidnap him , some wretched girls-the Touchables , they call themselves-capture Christian and spirit him away . They also steal some statues . The statues are the ones with expressions . <P> Anyway , they take Christian to this house , only it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course it 's a phallic symbol , silly . Is n't everything ? The Touchables keep Christian prisoner and make love to him . Women are such wretches , are n't they ? I mean , they can only think of one thing . The end ? Well , the wrestlers fight it out-divine-Christian goes to Hollywood , the girls get nothing , and their dome deflates . <P> Cyril , you better run if you want to catch it , because I do n't think it 's going to last too long . There were people actually booing when I saw it . The wretches .
