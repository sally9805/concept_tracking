It sometimes happens that a commissioned work-even of a well-known composer-does not please the patron . But usually in such a case , the less said about it , the better ; the patron either grits his teeth and holds a performance anyway , or he quietly shelves the work . Last week New Orleans Philharmonic Symphony Conductor Werner Torkanowsky broke this protocol by talking for the record about a commissioned work that he had rejected . And what made the case even more striking was the eminence of the composer : Darius Milhaud , 75 , durable veteran of the historic Les Six group of French composers in the 1920s . <P> Milhaud had delivered Music for New Orleans , a 30-minute orchestral piece commissioned for last week 's symphony concert in honor of the city 's 250th anniversary . After studying it and rehearsing it , Conductor Torkanowsky pronounced it " a disappointment " and substituted Milhaud 's 1923 composition , <P> La Creation du Monde , on the program . " As the greatest living French composer , Milhaud deserves to be represented in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a public statement . " We do not propose to present him at what might be his worst . " Furthermore , he said , the new work " would be a disappointment to the audience and to the spirit of the 250th anniversary . " <P> If he was bothered by the rejection , Milhaud gave no sign . At his apartment in the heart of Paris ' bouncy Pigalle district , he hardly had time to relax between chores . Besides busily attending rehearsals for the Paris Opera 's revival of his 1938 opera Medee , he had just finished incidental music for the Paul Claudel play , L'Histoire de Tobie et de Sara , and was starting a new orchestral composition . Meantime , he was looking ahead to a batch of forthcoming performances of his works - including Musique pour Lisbonne , a chamber piece that he has composed especially for this spring 's Gulbenkian Festival in that city . As for the New Orleans piece , Milhaud was plainly puzzled ; Torkanowsky , he said , had told him only that the performance of it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Torkanowsky 's public statement , he merely snorted , " Silly ! " - and went back to work .
