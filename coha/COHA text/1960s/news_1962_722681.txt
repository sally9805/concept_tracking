txt Ca n't Boss Reds , Refugee Says BY JULES DUBOIS Chicago Tribune Press Service ) Miami , Sept. 24 - Premier Fidel Castro has been barred from issuing orders to Russian troops in communist Cuba and is , therefore , facing one of the worst crises of his career , a refugee from Havana said today . Identity of the exile , who arrived here last week-end , is withheld to protect his relatives who are still in Cuba . Castro 's crisis primarily involves his wounded ego , the refugee said , and is similar to the one he went thru last year when the communist high command replaced him as president of the National Agrarian Reform institute with Carlos Rafael Rodriguez , one of the top old guard party members . Will Castro Accept ? The question now , the refugee explained , is whether for reasons of survival Castro will reconcile himself to a role ? seeondary to that of the Russian commander in Cuba . The exile made the following points : 1 . There are three Russian troop encampments , which no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Havana and Matanzas provinces . 2 . No estimate can be given as to the numerical strength of the Russian force other than to say that " there are enough of them now in Cuba so that attackers would be compelled to commit great damage and destruction to , make an invasion . " Castro 's Brother Obeys 3 . Castro has no control over the Russian force . The Russians take orders only from their own officers . 4 . His brother , Raul , deputy premier and minister of armed forces , is obediently taking orders from the Russian military . 5 . The Russians have landed missiles on 50 foot trailers that are believed capable of hitting targets in southern Florida . The trailers are used as launching sites . 6 . Africans from the Congo and Guinea were brought in as dock laborers to unload t h e Russian arms and ammunition . No Cubans have been allowed near the war supplies . Ca n't Rely on Militia 7 . At least 80 per cent of the Cuban people are opposed to the Russian invasion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great and informers are so numerous that the people have no chance to show their opposition . 8 . The militia is no longer a loyal force upon whom , Castro can count . On the night of Aug. 24 the militia , manning guns on rooftops at the Havana waterfront , failed to fire back at the student yacht that attacked the Mirimar district . Instead they cowered behind the walls to protect themselves from the invaders ' fire . Castro ordered the arrest of the gun crews the , next day . 9 . There have been clashes between Castro 's militia and Russian troops . None has reached major proportions . Most Favor Invasion 10 . The overwhelming majority of the Cuban people are clamoring for the United States to help liberate them . They would support any such action provided an invasion force led by Cubans lands with sufficient strength and fire power to consolidate a beachhead and has the full backing of the United States or Organization of American States . 11 . The dismissal of Anibal Escalante , top guard Communist , last March was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Castro . 12 . Castro requested the withdrawal of Russian Ambassador Sergei Kudriatsev because he had masterminded the downgrading of the premier a few months earlier when Castro accepted a figurehead status under party discipline . Moscow complied with his request . 13 . Shortages continue in food and clothing . A ration book allows a person to buy only $7.80 worth of scarce food a month . The shelves in the confiscated Sears stores are virtually empty , altho the show windows have attractive displays . If a customer asks for an item displayed in the show winnow nel or she is informed that it is unavailable but is on order . 14 . The Russians drink heavily and frequent bars . A group of curious Cuban Negroes in Matanzas were recently watching the Russians in a drinking bout in a bar . The Russians began to spit on the Negroes . The Cubans went to their homes and returned with knives determined to slash the Russians . Cuban soldiers had to be summoned to disperse them .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
