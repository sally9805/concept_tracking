txt In this prosperous , ? car-clogged capital anyone , it seems , can play the world 's oldest game . Here is how it 's done : " Hello , there ! " a voice hails you familiarly . It 's 10 o'clock on a ' cool African , morning . You are dressed for a press conference , hurrying to yo  --  ur car after running an errand on Government Road . " How have you been ? " You turn . The speaker is an African , in suit and tie like yourself . He 's just stepped off the curb toward his car . " Hello , " you respond ? quizzically . You have never seen him before . " What are you doing these days ? " he asks , coming over . " Oh , the usual . I 'm on my way to a meeting now . " " As usual , eh ? " He smiles in a friendly way . It is not easy to meet educated Kenyans , . to talk with them as equals . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Have we met ? " you ask , wanting to . formalize it . You figure : maybe all white men look alike . " Of course , it was . . . let 's see . . . " An apologetic smile . " It does n't matter , " you say . You introduce yourself . " Of course ! " He smiles . " I 'm Mr. So-and-so . " You shake hands . " Maybe we 've met at a press conference . Who knows ? I travel so much . I 'm permanent secretary of the Such Ministry . " You think : What great luck ! A " PS " has stopped you on the street ! " Just got back from Uganda two days ago . I was at Gatundu yesterday reporting to the President . " You think : The Presdient was busy yesterday ! There is a political crisis , and the Cabinet met then , too . " Tell me , " you say , " as long as we 're talking , what do you make of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It smacks of the ruling-party viewpoint . But at least ' it 's the viewpoint of a high official . " Can I give you a lift ? " you ask . " No , my driver will be right here , " he says . " My wife and her niece are with him . They 're going for a drive in the country . I think I 'll come to this press conference , too . " " Good , " you say . " Wonderful ! " " I 'm going to rent a car for my wife . Actually , I 'm a little short at the moment . Could you lend me ? 2 ? " " Pardon me ? " You must have heard it wrong , ? you think . The man is obviously educated , well dressed , and employed  --  one of the elite . " Could you lend me ? 2 ? Just till the press conference ? I 'll stop by my bank on the way over . " You stutter excuses . " Oh , you 're almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the way ? Well , I 'll see you later . " But he does not make the press conference , which is what you expected . Checking , you find that So-and-so really is the name of the " PS " of the Such Ministry . But was that he or an impostor ? You are not sure . You want to find out . GL What you have found out , though , is one of the ways that old , old game is played in Nairobi .
