txt There 's an international poker game quietly under way in Montreal . Only a few miles from Expo 67. a group of U.S. and foreign participants gathers regularly on the tenth floor of a downtown building for a contest of nerves whose outcome may pose problems for the future of international air travel . The players are government aviation experts from 15 countries . They are trying to rough out either a new treaty or an amendment to the 1929 Warsaw convention , raising officially the limits of accident liability for airlines here-and abroad engaged in international transportat ; ion of people and cargo . It 's a game with a longhistory , raising high emotions and carrying significance that may well surpass the limited-issues immediately at stake . The 1929 " agreement , covering more than 90 nations , specifies that the airlines are presumed at fault in any crash and must bear the legal burden of proving otherwise . It sets the liability lira , ' for personal , n , -. ury or death at only $8,300 per passenger  --  a sum that U.S.-Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on a human life . Absolute Liability A later increase affecting some flights was not enough to satisfy Washington . In response to U.S. threats to quit the Warsaw agreement . major international airlines have adopted an interim accord that raises the top liability to $75,000 and pins carriers with absolute , incontestable liability up to that amount , no matter what the cause of the crash , for flights to , from or stopping in the U.S. But that stopgap arrangement seems shaky . Its actual dollar effect on the airlines is not yet clear , and most participants would prefer a solider government-to-government treaty with milder terms . As the Montreal talks continue this week , however , the U.S. Government 's ' representatives are taking a stiff stand ; some want to go beyond the terms of the interim agreement . If they push too far , both U.S. and foreign airlines may balk . " We are just about convinced it would be cheaper to contest every claim on its merits , without any liability limits , if the Government tries to keep the absolute liability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says an Eastern Air Lines executive . If agreement is n't reached , experts from industry and Government agree , the resulting ill will could have these ominous effects : ? Future negotiations between the U.S. and other countries on landing rights and airport and aircraft safety standards could be bogged down . ? Commercial deals involving such expensive items as American-made jumbo jets and supersonic transports could be hampered . ? Operations of numerous international airline working arrangements allowing passage between many foreign points on a single ticket could be endangered . Differing Views No one really knows how high the stakes are . John Wanner , a Civil Aeronautics Board consultant who is a chief U.S. participant at Montreal , belittles the consequences , saying " we place little value " on the Warsaw treaty as it now stands . Some airline industry men , however , fear its demise could prove disastrous . Without the kind of uniform ticketing arrangements made possible by the treaty , says Pan American World Airways Vice President John Pirie , " the whole interline business gets to be a nightmare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international travelers are aided by such arrangements . The Warsaw treaty , designed to protect the fledgling airline industry against damage claims that could financially wipe out a carrier as a result of a single disaster , limited damage payments to $8,300 per passenger unless it could be proved the accident resulted from the airlines ' gross negligence or wilful misconduct . Primarily because of U.S. urgings , many of the Warsaw countries met at The Hague in 1955 and agreed to a new figure of $16,600 . The Hague accord , however , was never ratified by the U.S. Senate , and in 1965 the State Department announced the U.S. would withdraw from the Warsaw convention in mid-May 1966 unless the liability limits were raised to about $100.000 . In February last year , the discussions moved to the Montreal headquarters of the International Civil Aviation Organization , where the current talks are also going on . After weeks of maneuvering in early 1966 , an impasse was reached . " We all viewed these negotiations as a sort of lottery or poker game , " recalls Edward Bolster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The other representatives just did n't think we were serious about withdrawing : ' Finally , the International An- Transport Association , a private airlines ' group , asked if the U.S. would withdraw its denunciation of the treaty if the carriers themselves came up with an interim solution . In reply , Under Secretary of State Thomas Mann cabled the IATA director general , Sir William Hildred , " We will make every effort to do so if your efforts are successful . " Sir ** was able to convince 35 major international airlines to accept the interim arrangement requiring them to agree not to contest fault in personal injury and death cases involving flights to and from U S. points and where damages sought are lf:5.000 or less . Under U.S. pressure , more than 90 airlines have now joined up ; these carriers account for some 95 , ; ' , of Americans ' international travel , according to the CAB . As it now stands , the situation is one of more or less regulated confusion , decipherable by lawyers but perplexing to travelers , diplomats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hague agreement and the interim arrangement exist simultaneously , most aviation experts prefer to discuss the topic in terms of examples rather than broad rules . For instance , if a man is traveling from one Warsaw-convention country to another , he 's liinited to $8,300 recovery for damages , and the carrier is presumed liable . If he 's traveling from a Hague-agreement country to smother Hague eorritv-y , he can get up to $16,600 damages with the same presumption of liability . But if he touches down in the U.S. at any point in his travels , he can recover up to $75,000 , and the airline is deemed absolutely liable up to that amount . Aside from these complexities , the U.S. officially is pretty happy with the state of affairs now prevailing . Mr. Bolster of the State Department says he would like to stay with the interim agreement for at least a couple of years longer to see how well it really works . But there are several considerations adding urgency to the Montreal efforts to draft a new or revised permanent treaty . First , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the private arrangement among airlines . A treaty would indicate to any courts involved in litigation resulting from air disasters that the agreement in effect had the backing of the governments involved . And a treaty would certainly symbolize international harmony and goodwill better than the present stopgap arrangement . Second , very few governments or airlines are happy with the interim agreement . One key aviation industry man predicts " a sort of run on the bank " by earners wanting to get out of the agreement if they find one of their number hard hit by damage claims after the first crash to come under its jurisdiction . U.S. negotiator Wanner concedes the agreement may be " tottering on the brink . " Here are a couple of the reasons for such forecasts : ? While neither the insurance companies nor the airlines are divulging specifics , it 's generally acknowledged that airline insurance rates have gone up since the temporary agreement took effect last year . Some estimates put these increases between 100 ' ' , and 40()% for various carriers here and abroad . ? In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interim agreement seems to have dampened an international air travel deal .
