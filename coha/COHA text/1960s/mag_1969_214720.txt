REFLECTIONS UPON A SINKING SHIP by Gore Vidal . 255 pages . Little , Brown . $5.95 . <P> Put a toga and a wreath on Gore Vidal and he could pass as a Roman at Nero 's court . You know , the cheerfully disillusioned fellow in the corner who always said the empire would come to a bad end and-now that the fire has started-is absolutely the life of the party . <P> Nobody can beat the exhilaration of a pessimist who thinks the end-time has come . Writing slightly bad-tasting novels ( Myra Breckinridge ) and bland-tasting plays ( Visit to a Small Planet ) is just the start for Vidal . He keeps busy as an opinion maker , staging shoot-outs with William Buckley on TV and churning out some of the liveliest doomsday journalism ever , mostly in today 's essay form , the book review . <P> One imagines Vidal pressing these occasional pieces into hard covers , pronouncing them a book , then hurrying back to the new novel . The irony is that , like Norman Mailer and James Baldwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonfiction than fiction . The tart , slight , often exquisite perceptions in this book-concentrated as sour fruit drops-are really his forte . <P> Decline of the Best . As he watches the sun slowly set on Western civilization , Vidal , scribbling his epitaphs in the shape of aphorisms , could hardly glow more brightly . Nothing is beyond his sardonic appreciation : the Kennedys , Tarzan , the 29th Republican Convention , Susan Sontag , pornography . <P> A sort of well-informed aloofness is the secret of the Vidal all-purpose style . <P> He writes about live people rather as if they were dead and dead people rather as if they were alive . He approaches American politics like an alert observer from a foreign-and slightly hostile-country ( " American Empire " is one of his favorite phrases ) . On the subject of sex , he scarcely seems to belong to the human race at all , doing a marvelous impersonation of an anthropologist from Mars on a friendly but clinical visit . <P> Vidal is his own best act , and he does show off . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ references to the Spartans , and advising the reader to check his concept of masculinity against circuitous quotations from the Apocrypha ( Il Maccabees 4 : 7-15 ) . Even in the midst of considering children 's literature , the portentous generalization can tempt him : " In the last fifty years we have contributed relatively little in the way of new ideas of any sort . From radar to rocketry , we have had to rely on other societies " etc. , etc . Sarcasm betrays him into rhetorical flourishes : Lyndon Johnson is " the Great Khan at Washington " ; objection to John O'Hara 's handling of sex is archly laid to the " Good Gray Geese of the press . " <P> Maverick Lemming . But Vidal allows neither exhibitionism nor malice to keep him from his duties as journalist . Vidal did a flagrant hatchet job on the Kennedys ; but he is also highly informative not only about the Kennedy family but about politicians in general and how they behave in the pursuit of power . He is wickedly funny about Henry Miller , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
