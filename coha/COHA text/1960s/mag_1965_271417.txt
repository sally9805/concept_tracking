Two of the Arab world 's most important monarchs last week chose new crown princes . The conscientious kings of Saudi Arabia and Jordan both bypassed younger brothers ( both named Mohammed ) to name more sobersided brothers who are younger still . <P> &gt; Jordan 's plucky King Hussein , 29 , ignored his tantrum-prone younger brother Mohammed , 24 , to bestow the title of Crown Prince on Prince Hassan , a gifted Harrow graduate who is already enrolled at Oxford at the age of 17 . By so doing , Hussein took the crown rights from his own infant son , three-year-old Prince Abdullah . He feared Jordanians would reject Abdullah as King because the child 's mother , Princess Muna ( formerly Toni Gardner ) , was a British commoner . After the decision was announced , Princess Muna flew abruptly to Britain for a " medical checkup , " taking Abdullah and his little brother with her . It was her second trip home to see the doctor within a month , but spokesmen at Hussein 's palace in Amman denied that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saudi Arabia 's sad-eyed King Feisal , 61-who succeeded profligate King Saud only last November-skipped Prince Mohammed ibn Abdul Aziz , 57 , and picked shy Prince Khaled ibn Abdul Aziz , 55 , as his eventual successor . The passed-over prince is a cheerful bon vivant , who himself suggested that Khaled be named the royal heir-and was reportedly rewarded with more than $1,000,000 for his unselfishness . Khaled , who is known as " the quiet one , " has assisted Feisal at international conferences , currently is Saudi Arabia 's Deputy Premier . A painfully shy , hardworking administrator , he is an expert hunter , relaxes by competing in camel-milk-drinking contests with Arabian desert tribes .
