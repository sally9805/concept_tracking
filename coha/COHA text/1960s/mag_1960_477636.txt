EVERYBODY knows that it is wicked for the public to run anything that makes money . That is Socialism ? the sin which we are taught front the bassinet to shun beyond all others . I know men who have broken at least seven of the Ten Commandments with no perceptible shudder , but who will start sweating and crossing themselves at the very mention of Socialism . For that is the transgression their friends could never forgive . The boys at the office might blink at adultery or even overlook a little theft , if performed with benefit of counsel ? but any hint of softness toward Socialism would put a man forever outside the tribe . On the other hand , if an enterprise is clearly unprofitable , then it is perfectly all right for the public to run it . Our folk customs have always condoned government operation of those things which are absolutely essential , but which can never hope to make a dime ? the Army , for example , and the Post Office and the schools . According to these moral precepts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public to take over most of the commuter railroads . They arc obviously indispensable ; our big cities could n't keep going for a clay without them . Just as obviously , they are unprofitable ; for years now their own managers have been whimpering that the commuters are bankrupting every rail system which they infest . The outcome has been apparent for a long while . Eventually each of the great metropolitan areas ? New York , Philadelphia , Boston , Chicago , Los Angeles , and a few others ? almost certainly will have to take responsibility for providing rail service for its commuters . This need not mean , of course , whole railroads . Commuter service passenger cars ( and the right to move them over the rails ) to some public authority . ( A third function , long-distance passenger service , probably will wither away , as travelers complete their shift from trains to highways and the air . In many places it has disappeared already ; a Texan , for instance , can no longer travel by rail from his state 's capital to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to handle the commuter business is a specialized , non-political body such as New York 's Port Authority ? for reasons noted by Edward T. Chase in the June issue of Harper 's . Such an authority can reach across state lines , to cover the entire metropolitan area . It can mesh rail service with bus and private auto traffic , to create a unified system designed to move people in and out of the city 's inner core as efficiently as possible . And it can use its profits from toll roads and bridges to offset losses from the commuter rail service . ( That , incidentally , would purge it of the dread taint of Socialism . Because the New York Port Authority is raking in so much cash at its toll booths , its soul is now in mortal danger ; but it can be saved if the PA takes over the money-losing commuter assignment . ) Unless sonic such system is adopted fairly soon , all of our biggest cities will find themselves choking to death on auto traffic ? and breaking their fiscal backs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to unclog their streets . For the steady deterioration of the commuter lines is daily forcing more people to travel by car ? and every study yet made has proved that the auto is the most costly and disrupting method for such travel , while the railroad is the cheapest and most efficient . W H Y has n't a remedy so sensible ? and so inescapable , in the long run ? been taken long ago ? Only now are we beginning to experiment gingerly in this direction ? notably in Boston and Philadelphia . But every other major nation in the world 14 THE EDITOR 'S has long since adopted it , usually a couple of generations before we even got around to thinking about it . From London to Tokyo , metropolitan transport is managed by public agencies as a public service . Moreover , in all of the big foreign cities that I 've visited , the result is far more satisfactory than anything we can show here . ( The exception was Moscow , but I was there just at the end of the war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost total destruction . Even then , the subways put ours to shame . ) It 's a puzzlement . Here we are , a people who pride ourselves on our practicality , our knack for big-scale organization , our talent for Getting Things Done . Yet we 've failed to tackle the only practical , and proven , solution to one of our most painfully urgent needs . Why ? The answer , I suspect , may be purely theological . We cower away from the shadow of sin , even though the substance has vanished . After all , the railroads once made money ? great , handsome green gobs of it . Because it is hard for us to realize that those days are gone forever , we still think of the railroads as divinely reserved for private enterprise . So the notion of public management of even the most bankrupt fraction of these once-sacred relics still carries a whiff of the Socialist heresy . Although in this case the sin of Socialism is now patently impossible , yet we shrink from any action ? however practical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an octogenarian Methodist deacon , far past any suspicion of concupiscence , would still hesitate to be seen in night clubs with a chorus girl . IT IS hard to think of any other explanation . Some people might argue that anything the government runs is bound to be inefficient ; but for two reasons , this argument wo n't hold much water . True enough , some government operations are notoriously inefficient ? the Post Office and the Pentagon , For example . Yet others ? the National Park Service , the Tennessee Valley Authority , the Federal Reserve Board , to mention only a few ? run with a smooth competence that most private firms might envy . And even the worst of our government services do n't really have to be as bad as they are . England and France both manage to run postal services that strike a visiting American as marvels of efficiency ; in London mail is delivered six times a day , and so swiftly that you can drop a note in the box in the morning and get a reply before dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it badly enough to take the postal system entirely out of politics , and to give it the money it needs ? there is n't much doubt we could get it . The second hole in the efficiency argument is EASY CHAIR that our commuter railroads could n't possibly be any less efficient than they are now . For example , only a real genius at mismanagement could get the New York Central and the New Haven ? the biggest of the country 's commuter lines ? into a worse mess than the one they have been stewing in for years . If you have n't ridden their trains , you will find it hard to believe that Americans could run anything so badly . They are chronically late ; breakdowns and fires arc constant occurrences . The roiling stock gets so little maintenance that it sometimes falls apart even when standing still . A Few weeks ago I boarded a train at Grand Central just as a door dropped off one of its cars : the conductor took twenty minutes to find a laborer to tote away the rusted slab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haven announced last June that it was laying off the men who cleaned the cars , the news astonished its customers ; they had seen no evidence that such crews ever existed . Sleet , snow , rain , or a heavy dew can paralyze both lines for hours , and during the winter passengers think nothing of sitting in a dead train indefinitely , without heat or light , while the crew tries to figure out what went wrong this time . ( When this last happened to me , 1 finally got off the train in the wilds of lower Westchester , clambered up an embankment through eighteen inches of snow , and walked a mile and a half to find a taxi which finally got me home , three hours late , for a $5 fare . The railroad , of course , refused a refund on my ticket . ) Apparently only the grace of God has ? up till now ? forestalled a major accident like those which took scores of lives a few years ago on the Long Island railway . THIS state of affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads ? like that of many other railways ? has been dominated for years by financial manipulators rather than experienced railroad men . The present president of the New York Central is a trained operating man , and under his hand the deterioration of the service has at least slowed up a little ; but previously the line had been a plaything of the late Robert R. Young , who was strictly a fast-buck financier . George Alpert , president of the New Haven , is a lawyer . His predecessor was Patrick B. McGinnis , whose open-handed *When this word was used recently by a Connecticut Congressman to describe the New Haven , the road 's general passenger traffic manager , Mr. Charles A. Goodwin , got quite indignant . He admitted that he had seen cars that were " not clean , but never filthy . " The distinction is a delicate one , but most commuters would , I think , hold that the Congressman 's semantics are inure precise than Mr. Goodwin's. squandering of the company 's r was sharply criticized last Jul Interstate Commerce Cominissi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had $120,000 to fix lip " a pretentiou elaborate " office for himself-Mete with a $3,675 teakwood ca and a $25 calfskin-covered basket ? and had rented a per apartment for $24,000 a year c company 's money . All this at a when the New Haven could n't the cash to repair its broken- , locomotives , and kept pleading erty to justify one fare increase another. * Just to complete the record , governor Abe Ribicoff of Connecti a notably mild-mannered am strained man ? has accused the Haven , on the basis of a care documented report by his PI Utilities Commission , of mismai ment , wasting " great sums of its ital , " discourtesy to its custot and " shabby bookkeeping . " These examples may not be ital . A few other commuter roads ( for instance , those so Chicago ) seem to be making a effort to pull up their socks . Bu evidence of sorry managemel plentiful enough . Many of the clearly could n't be any worst , under public operation ? and i new management could apps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the F Service in the handling of our resources , the improvement u ; be downright breath-taking . T H E only other argument I think of against public operatic the more derelict commuter lir that it might cost the taxpay , lot of money . At first glance , seems plausible . Such roads do a heavy injection of fresh capita replace their worn-out equip and to catch up on long ove maintenance work . In the b ning , at least , this would hal . ?

Most of its properties have n't sr drop of paint in years . come out of the taxpayers ' pocketbook . But that 's where it is coming from anyhow . Railroad officials now seem to spend most of their energies begging for public handouts , in the form of both subsidies and tax abatements . Already they have got a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply because neither state nor federal governments can afford to let the trains stop running . Would n't it be a lot cheaper , in the long run , for a competent public agency to make this investment directly , instead of dribbling out endless subsidies to the present inept managements ? Remember , too , that a public transport authority could make truly impressive savings in other directions . Once it got the railroads back into shape ? so they could offer fast , clean , reliable service for reasonable fares ? it could expect to win back a lot of the customers who have forsaken the trains for automobiles . Then it could begin to make auto traffic pay a bigger share of its cost , by raising highway and bridge tolls and downtown parking fees . This step might well divert enough additional traffic to the rails to put them back on their fiscal feet . At the same time it would cut down on the enormous subsidies we are now paying to the auto , in the form of thruways , tunnels , bridges , parkways , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin out , we would get some relief from the obvious ( though hard to calculate ) expenses which result from traffic congestion . Every businessman who has to spend thirty minutes and a dollar taxi fare whenever he wants to move a dozen blocks in midtown New York can make a fair estimate for himself . WHEN all these potential savings are added up , they might indicate , not a bigger burden for the taxpayer , but a smaller one . Nobody really knows , because such a thoroughgoing fiscal analysis has never been made . This might be a useful chore for the new President to assign to the Interstate Commerce Commission . Meanwhile , the rest of us might examine our own consciences . Could be that we would discover that public ownership is not really a sin , automatically and under all circumstances . In a case like this it does n't look like Socialism at all . It looks like the plainest kind of common sense . Laurels to Dr. Jaffe B ACK in September 1957 , Harper 's published an article on " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Byrne Professor of Administrative Law at the Harvard Law School . He documented for the first time the curious way in which the Federal Communications Commission was handing out television franchises worth millions of dollars . It apparently was following no clear and intelligible set of standards , Dr. Jaffe argued , in choosing between rival applicants ? and he set forth reasons for suspecting " political favoritism , " " bureaucratic caprice , " and worse . The article attracted considerable attention in Washington , and later was cited as one of the factors which led to the Congressional investigation of the television industry . Subsequently two of the Commissioners resigned , and one of them is under a federal indictment . The reconstituted Commission has now set aside its grant of Channel 5 in Boston ? one of the cases mentioned in Dr. Jaffe 's article ? and has called for hearings on the issuance of a new license . ( The licensee , the Boston Herald-Traveler newspapers , was accused of nothing worse than " an attempted pattern of influence " on a former FCC chairman ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continue broadcasting pending a decision . ) Another license-holder was deprived of its right to broadcast over Channel 10 in Miami , and two other applicants there were disqualified . This is the most vigorous action yet taken by the FCC to clean up the television industry and to refurbish its own reputation . It deserves commendation . And Dr. Jaffe might well feel some modest satisfaction for his part in starting the whole thing .
