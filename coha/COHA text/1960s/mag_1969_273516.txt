Not since Czarist days has Russia bothered to foster relations with faraway Peru , or has Peru cared about Russia . Now the two are becoming the best of friends . Three weeks ago they agreed to exchange ambassadors . Last week , after twelve days divided between business negotiations and Latin hospitality , representatives of both nations gathered at Lima 's graceful Torre Tagle Palace to sign a two-year trade agreement . The precise products and terms are so far uncertain ; the Soviet Union , through European middlemen , is already purchasing sizable quantities of Peruvian fishmeal . But the meaning of the event was clear . Peru 's Foreign Minister , Eduardo Mercado Jarrn , one of a spangle of generals who seized power last October , called the occasion " the end of an era in which our trade was channeled in only one direction . " <P> Mercado meant his voice to carry , and it did . Washington is dismayed these days by the fact that once friendly , conservative military men like those in the Peruvian junta have become as vociferously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nixon a decade ago when he visited South America as Vice President . Peru 's rulers have seized a U.S. oil subsidiary called International Petroleum Co. , and refuse even to discuss reparations with parent Standard Oil of New Jersey . Indeed , the Peruvians claim that I.P.C. owes them another $17 million . Two weeks ago a perennial squabble over fishing rights flared again when a Peruvian navy vessel challenged U.S. tuna boats working within the 200-mile limit that Peru claims as territorial water . On earlier occasions , tuna men were released after buying fishing licenses . This time the Peruvians pumped more than sixty shots into one trawler . After U.S. officials inspected the porous hull , Ambassador John Wesley Jones submitted a $50,000 damage bill to Peru . Unless the I.P.C. situation improves , U.S.-Peruvian relations will come to a bitter climax in April when President Nixon is forced by the Hickenlooper Amendment to revoke $79 million in aid and preferential sugar purchases from Peru . <P> Economic Aggression . Peru 's neighbors are scarcely happy about the I.P.C. controversy . As Argentine Economics Minister Adalbert Krieger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type affects all the countries and creates the impression that we do not favor foreign investment . " Nor are they pleased by Peru 's threat to charge the U.S. before the Organization of American States with " economic aggression " ( the countercharge , quite properly , will be that the U.S. is willing to accept expropriation if need be but insists that Peru observe international law and make repayment ) . Yet , in a showdown , most would probably side with Peru because of the sad state of U.S.-Latin American relations , in spite of huge U.S. private investment . Once , other nations in the hemisphere could command U.S. attention by pointing to the threat of Castro subversion . Now , however , Cuban infiltration has failed1 and Castro has been muffled by the Russians as the Soviets seek peaceful expansion and influence in South America . One way for Latin politicians to make the U.S. notice is to go right ahead and parley with the Russians .                    @
