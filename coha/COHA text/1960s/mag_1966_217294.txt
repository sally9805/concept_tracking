When the 1954 Geneva Conference divided Viet Nam in two , it established a demilitarized buffer zone between the Communist North and anti-Communist South . The zone is six miles wide . It roughly follows the 17th parallel from the mountainous Laotian border in the west through thickly jungled foothills to the fertile paddies along the coast . For twelve years , it was the quietest place in all of Viet Nam . <P> Last week the peace was broken . On four separate days , American warplanes swooped in to bomb the demilitarized zone-and the antiaircraft barrage that greeted them did not come from Communist carbines and pistols . The whole western section of the DMZ was alive with North Vietnamese troops , elements of Ho Chi Minn 's ill-fated 324th Division , which had been driven out of South Viet Nam last month by the U.S. Marines ' Operation Hastings . Intelligence reports indicated that the 324th was no stranger to the area ; rather than risk running the gauntlet of air reconnaissance and allied strongpoints along the Ho Chi Minh trail , the division had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight across the forbidden DMZ . <P> Communist protests against the bombing were significantly muffled . Even North Viet Nam contented itself with accusing the U.S. of " trampling underfoot " the Geneva accords . But Canada , which , together with India and Poland , is charged with maintaining the International Control Commission that supposedly keeps Viet Nam at peace , immediately pressed for an investigation and steps to clear the DMZ of all military activity . <P> In Washington , Secretary of State Dean Rusk backed the Canadians all the way . " We would be glad to see the I.C.C . move to clear the demilitarized zone of all military action , " he told a press conference . Although Rusk did not deny that the bombing could be considered further escalation of the war , he pointed out to reporters that it was the North Vietnamese government that had originally militarized the zone by sending in troops . " The chronology of escalation is based on the fact that they keep coming , " he said . " What we would prefer is that they send some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in striped pants , not people in uniform .
