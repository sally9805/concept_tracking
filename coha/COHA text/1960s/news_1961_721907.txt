txt A vigorous campaign has begun to organize a strike of artists starting Sept. 11 . An artists ' group , grieved by the apparent inhospitality of city laws , is polling 1,000 artists to test their readiness to take action to draw world-wide attention to their housing troubles . According to the plan , participating artists would withhold their works from galleries and museums for as long as it takes the city to change its laws  --  or at least its mind  --  about letting them live and work in lofts . Since February , the group says , life in lofts has been made uncertain , first by a wave of visits from Fire Department inspectors and more recently by a series of crackdowns by Building Department inspectors . Evictions have followed some visits . If the strike move is successful , artists would keep their new works from galleries and museums here and would seek to withdraw works already on exhibition . Artists in other cities and in other nations would be urged to respect the New York picket lines . But the proposal is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdraw as ? artists from the life of the cam , community " by boycotting lectures , . forums and radio or television programs in which artists might ordinarily participate . The Artist Tenants Association , organized in March , claims the full support of a dozen prominent artists in its strike plan . Among them are Willem de Kooning , considered the lead . ing figure in American abstract expressionism ; Ad Reinhardt , ? celebrated proponent of a severely restricted or " classical " abstract art ; Chaim Gross , a . sculptor especially known for . ? his carvings in wood ; Richard Stankiewicz , a leader of the school that assembles bits of junk , discarded machine parts and other objects into sculptural ' compositions . Others announced as supportIng the action include Esteban Vicente , Ibram Lassaw , Robert Motherwell , Helen Frankenthaler , William Stanley Hayter , Israel Levitan and Ezio Martinelli . A heavy majority of those who have publicly revealed their support are members of the abstract expressionist and related movements . Postcard Poll Started A letter proposing the strike has been sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bears boxes marked " Yes " and " No . " There is space for a signature and address . The association declined to state how many postcards had been returned in the two weeks since the mailing . It said that ? early , though still inconclusive , returns were running strongly in favor of striking . If a suffi , dent majority of the respondents check " Yes , " the protest will be signaled . There are about 400 galleries in New York . The strike 's effect on them would depend very much on the association 's ability to get a heavy majority of the  - -  best known artists to agree tol the plan . James Gahagan Jr. , chairman ... of the association , says the strike would not be intended to ' hurt galleries but rather to get them to assist artists in their fight and to dramatize the problem . Thousands of artists are now living , many without legal sanction , in lofts that have long been vacated by manufacturing enterprises . They resent the enforcement of b Buildinm and Fire Codes designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similarity to the artists ' uncrowded use of lofts . Barred From Apartments The laws make life difficult ? . for artists , because it is illegal for them to work in apartments on the one hand and illegal to live in most lofts on the other . , But few artists can afford to keep separate homes and studios . Loft apartment-studios are a good solution  --  until inspectors come rapping at the doors . Lofts are , in fact , a kind of last resort for artists here , because they are singularly adaptable to their special needs . Large windows let in plenty of natural light . Unpartitioned floors and high ceilings afford adequate space for painting , sculpture , dancing or rehearsing play roles . Because lofts are mostly in nonresidential sections , often on streets that are empty at night , they afford privacy and keep the noisier activities of sculptors and dancers from being a distraction to neighbors . Lofts are relatively inexpensive . Rents run from about $50 to $125 a month . If existing codes were to be stringently enforced all over town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in droves . ' Living in Hiding ' " Most artists have the feeling they 're living in hiding , " Mr. Gahagan said . Many refuse to reveal their home addresses except to trusted friends . The chairman regarded this as a pitiful commentary on one of the principal art centers of the world . He said the association wanted the artists ' use of lofts made legal . " When the city wants baseball , bingo , business or breweries , it passes laws to make them possible . If it wants us in New York , it can pass laws to make our existence here possible . " This could be accomplished , he said , either by a difficult series of changes that would affect 200 provisions of the Administrative Code or , more probably , by the adoption of an omnibus provision protecting - artists in lofts . A legal committee of the association is now - at work on this . - But ? even that , Mr. Gahagan said , would be only a temporary solution . Lofts are being ' demolished to make way for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks something will have to be done to persuade builders of middleincome apartments to include : , studio apartments on top floors . It wants money to be made available , either by subsidy or low-interest loans , for the conversion of existing small buildings into studio apartments . A half dozen founders of the association have walked out Over the strike proposal , including its first chairman , Dan Koerner , who regards the gallery boycott as " an evasion of the emergency facing the artists . " " These people act upon the assumption that their withdrawal would be earth-shaking news , exposing before the world a Philistine city , " Mr. Koerner said . " They fail to see the other side of the coin ; the artist as a Don Quixote . If one wants to follow their kind of logic to Its ultimate , the artists , in their last desperate resolve , would gather around the Museum of Modern Art and there commit collective suicide .
