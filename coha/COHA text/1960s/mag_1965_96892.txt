There are 23 teams in the NCAA tournament , all of them listed neatly in the little boxes on the chart on the opposite page . To paraphrase an old line , you could say , " Twenty-two skid-doo ! " and accurately reflect the overwhelming opinion of the public and the polls , which have established a field of teams and a team to beat . The team to beat is Michigan . // Michigan has not lost since January 2 , when it was upset 75-74 by St. John 's in Madison Square Garden , although many of its victories since then have appeared to be hairbreadth escapes from defeat . Close or not , they were victories , and against strong opposition . The Wolverines have earned the role of favorite . // If beating Michigan is a requisite for winning the title , seven of the 22 teams in the field have the personnel and the playing style to become champion : St. Joseph 's , Miami of Ohio , Notre Dame , Oklahoma State , Brigham Young , San Francisco and UCLA . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of the composite NCAA title-holder that emerges from a study of the tournaments since 1951 , when the field was expanded from eight to 16 teams and became essentially the kind of competition it is today . Here is that ideal team : // The team has seniors on it but is not dominated by them . It has , in fact , nearly as many sophomores as seniors , and more juniors than either . // The team has a good bench , but not a deep one . Seldom does an NCAA champ depend on more than seven regulars . It is marked by superior teamwork and is well-balanced , but it is led by an All-America , most often at center . He plays his best in the tournament , but he is not a superstar , nor is he one of the nation 's highest scorers . He is an All-America in large measure because his talents fit so well with those of the other players on his team , rather than because he overshadows them . The collegiate superstars , contrarily , usually have carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only Bill Russell , of those acknowledged to be superstars in the pros , led his team to a title . The others  --  Pettit , Chamberlain , Baylor , Robertson and West  --  lost in the finals or semifinals , while such players as Schlundt , Rosenbluth , Hatton , Imhoff and Harkness led their teams to victory . // ( Coincidentally , it has been true since 1954 that the team among the NCAA 's final four that boasts the highest individual scorer does not win . This could jinx Michigan , for Cazzie Russell is the ninth highest scorer in the country , and only one of the other eight has steered his team into the tournament  --  Bill Bradley of Princeton , who is No. 3 . Presumably , the only thing that can save Michigan is for Princeton also to go to the finals in Portland. ) // The team , if not staffed by highly experienced players , is led by a coach with many years of college competition behind him . Ohio State 's Fred Taylor and Cincinnati 's Ed Jucker brought home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptions , THE TEAM 'S coach has masterminded at least 250 games and won two-thirds of them . // The team is among the nation 's leaders in either offense or defense . It does not seem to matter which , only that it be superior in one of the extremes of playing styles . It is , however , better at rebounding than shooting , whether it specializes in offense or defense . // The team is no surprise . It has been ranked prominently by the wire-service polls  --  almost always in the top three , and nearly half the time as No. 1 . // The team supports the theory that a champion is a good road club , but only because it wins everywhere . It does not lose more than three games during the season , and it almost never loses at home . ( In 166 games over 14 years , the champion has lost twice at home . ) Perhaps even more important , it has almost as much success on neutral courts , where NCAA tournament games are played . // The team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conference and wins that race rather easily , without a pressure-packed struggle . ( " My team 's pretty courageous , " says Michigan Coach Dave Strack . " It did n't win all the close ones , but most of them . That 's the mark of a good team . It 's an old adage but true . " It is an old adage , but it does not apply to NCAA champions , who seldom get involved in close games on the way to the tournament . Michigan , on the other hand , has played in seven games that were decided by three points or less . Its only two losses were by one point , and the Wolverines won a bunch of tight ones. ) // The team has the killer instinct , preferring to kick hell out of a rival when it gets a few points ahead rather than merely win . It outscores opponents by an average of at least 12 points a game , and is not the least bit ashamed to win a couple by 30 or 40. // These are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 champions , and only one  --  Kentucky 's Fiddling Five of 1958  --  had less than half of them . By these standards , which admittedly do not include such occasionally decisive happenstances as uncommonly hot-shooting nights and common colds , this year 's St. Joseph 's team stands out impressively . The Hawks lack seniors ( but Indiana won in 1954 without any ) . Also Cliff Anderson does not have the stature of the past top centers on championship teams . A 6-foot-4 sophomore , he leads the team 's balanced scoring , is ninth in the country in rebounds and has almost as much potential as Matt Guokas , the 6-foot-5 sophomore guard who is starting to make All-America teams . Otherwise St. Joe matches the composite champion in every way , from coach ( Dr. Jack Ramsey , 209-65 ) to record ( 25-1 , no losses at home or on neutral courts ) to average margin of victory ( 17.6 ) . It ranks third in both major polls , is 12th nationally in offense , was undefeated in its conference and won the Quaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , may be easier than on the court . The Wolverines were always the heftiest and strongest team around , and now Coach Strack occasionally sends in 6-foot-10 sophomore sub Craig Dill and shifts 6-foot-8 Bill Buntin to the corner . George Pomey ( 6 feet 4 and 195 pounds ) has been starting for the past two months in place of 6-foot 165-pound John Thompson , adding even more size to the regular lineup . Still , Pomey is the shrimp on this team . Michigan used seven men last Saturday in a close game with Minnesota , and every one but Pomey outweighed the heavyweight boxing champion of the world . // Pomey 's size is only an incidental benefit . The important thing about his move onto the first team is that he has made the Michigan half-court zone press work . Pomey is the point man on the press ; on offense he is taking over the playmaking duties  --  which frees Cazzie Russell and lets him crash diagonally through the lane to a corner and back out to set up a low post . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Strack says . " He sees things . He 's always had a good knack for getting the ball into the low post when he played in the corner . That was one reason I did n't want to move him from a forward . " // Pomey has added spark to a team that , even with a player of Russell 's drive and talent , tended to relax and get overconfident . " We seem to be slow starters against teams we feel we can beat easily , " Strack says . Six times Michigan has had to come back from half-time deficits to win , but this problem may now be solved . // Even with Pomey , Michigan 's zone may not be as effective a weapon as it would have been a year ago . The press is being used so much this season that most teams are prepared  --  at least mentally  --  for it , and its value as a surprise move has diminished considerably . UCLA , which made the press so fashionable last year , is itself a bit more vulnerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nuances of this gambit , and he and safety man Keith Erickson may have too much backcourt territory to cover . Last year the team 's center helped out there , but this year the center moves up and guards the man making the inbound pass , leaving only two men back . // Fast-breaking Brigham Young , which knows how to get the ball in and up and has good guards , has an excellent chance to end UCLA 's title defense Friday night . The game is on BYU 's home court at Provo , Utah , and the Bruins , quick as they are , will have to be at their very best to stay alive . BYU may well get knocked off the next night by San Francisco . Nobody  --  including the players themselves  --  knows how good USF is . The Dons went through an easy schedule in desultory fashion , but they handle the boards well and take good shots , and if Ollie Johnson and Joe Ellis get help , San Francisco may control the tempo of the game and steal the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonus , because whoever wins in the Far West should have a clear road to the final game in Portland next Saturday . The Midwest teams are below par . Hank Iba kept the Olympic title for the U.S. and won the Big Eight for himself for the first time , but sentiment and James King are about all Oklahoma State can offer . King , says Iba , is the best defensive player in the country , but the Cowboys are too skinny and do not shoot as well as a ball-control team should . They could beat Wichita State , if it came to that , but Notre Dame , with its personality problems straightened out , is a dark horse on a hot streak riding out of the eastern time zone into the Midwest Regional this year . // Michigan 's toughest battle in the Mideast Regional should be against Miami , if the Redskins can get that far . Center Charley Dinkins has recovered from pneumonia  --  which will give Miami some rebounds  --  but the Redskins still can not match Michigan on the boards and need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not figure to offer too much trouble . Southeastern Conference teams made some of the other Commodores look like better players by ganging up on Center Clyde Lee , but Michigan would not have to resort to that . Each Wolverine is a one-man gang . // There are more good teams in the East , and St. Joe 's will need luck . It is lucky at the start , playing Connecticut at the Palestra . To win after that , the Hawks must get by Providence , which gave them their only defeat , and probably North Carolina State . But Bill Bradley will be floating on adrenaline , and if Princeton 's sophomores continue to support him as they have done recently , it is just possible that the Tigers will beat Penn State , N.C. State and , finally , St. Joe's. // Nobody has yet found a better way of beating Michigan than just by giving the ball to Bradley  --  as demonstrated in New York 's Holiday Festival . Coaches who do not have Bradley on their teams are in sharp disagreement , naturally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a control game . Others say just as adamantly that that is impossible  --  that the Wolverines must be run with and fought with on the boards . Obviously , Michigan has too much talent for anybody to come up with a magic catch-all formula . " Teams that try to change what they have done best have n't done well against us , " Strack says . " Those are gimmicks , and I do n't believe in gimmicks . The thing is just for a team to do the things it does best , but do them a little better against us. " // That appears to be the hard , simple truth . It is no easy job , but St. Joe 's can derive confidence from the fact that it has some history on its side .
