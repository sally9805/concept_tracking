THE BEDBUG AND SELECTED POETRY 317 pp. ) - Vladimir Mayakovsky-Meridian ( $1.55 ) . <P> <P> Not every Russian who changes his shirt commits suicide , but Russian suicides cling to the superstition that a change of linen should precede death . On April 14 , 1930 Poet Vladimir Vladimirovich Mayakovsky changed his shirt . Then he slipped a cartridge into his revolver and played Russian roulette . He lost . According to his friend Boris Pasternak , " the news rocked the telephones , blanketed faces with pallor ... people all the way up the staircase wept and pressed against each other . " It was a blow from which Soviet literature has never quite recovered , for Mayakovsky was the unchallenged laureate of the revolution . A critic named Josef Stalin flatly acclaimed him as " the best and most talented poet of our Soviet epoch . " <P> Why did Mayakovsky kill himself ? He was the darling of the masses , a huge handsome fellow of 36 , whose thundering voice and flamboyant presence were guaranteed to fill any hall in Russia . Fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to make the Russian language his private property . Shortly before his death he had promised to " raise/above the heads of a gang of self-seeking/poets and rogues. / 11 the hundred volumes of my Communist-committed books . " But the last poem he ever wrote ended : " Love 's boat has smashed against the daily grind. /Now you and I are quits . ' <P> Steam &; Soap . In a sensible introduction to The Bedbug and Selected Poetry Editor Patricia Blake recognizes the danger of clinging to any single clue to explain why the poet courted death . Mayakovsky had suffered a nervous breakdown , had been ill with a stubborn grippe , and was always ' deadly bored . " In spite of his popularity , he was chronically lonely and in spite of his laureate 's standing the shifting Party lines of Soviet literature had left him with a persecution complex . Besides , the latest of his long series of love affairs was going badly . Most important all , he was fed up with propaganda and propagandists . " You ca n't immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There would n't be enough bathhouses or soap . " <P> Mayakovsky had lived as a revolutionary since childhood . His father was an impoverished nobleman reduced to forest ranger and Vladimir was only twelve when he stole his father 's shotguns and delivered them to the local rebels for the revolution 1905 ; At 15 , already a Bolshevik handyman in Moscow , he sat in prison for eleven months reading every book he could get hold of . Back in circulation , he went to art school for awhile . But when a painter friend heard one of his poems , he proclaimed young Vladimir a genius , set him on the road to becoming what his American friend Max Eastman called the " nearest to the banging in of a cyclone that poetry ever produced .
