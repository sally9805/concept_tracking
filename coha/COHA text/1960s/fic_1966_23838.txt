TREPLEFF A Story by MacDonald Harris The theater where the rehearsals were held was a little building that had been a cabinet shop be . fore it was acquired by the Players . It had no ceiling and if you looked up into the roof you saw a labyrinth of beams and wooden props , rather amateurishly fitted with lights from which festoons of wiring hung down . Perhaps because it had been a cabinet shop the building always smelled of freshly cut wood . The rehearsals took place in the afternoon , after the students who were taking classes were out of school . At precisely three o'clock Egon would burst into the theater exuding energy , his corduroy jacket unbuttoned to display his waistcoat . Odor of cologne , bass voice , ears with small black tufts of hair growing out of them . Amethyst on third finger of perfectly manicured hand . " Stage , stage . Places , everybody . Where 's Trepleff ? Nina ... Pauline ... over here . Where 's Mme. Arkadina ? " Mme. Arkadina , in real life the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom , which served for both sexes . " Irina Nikolaevna , get the hell out of the can . " His voice could be heard all over the building , through walls and inside the deepest closets . He always called us by our stage names and sometimes I wondered whether he knew our real names . At first we were Trepleff , Sorin , or Mme. Arkadina and then when we got on more intimate terms he began addressing us in the Russian fashion with first name and patronymic : I was Konstantin Gavrilovich , Sorin was Pyotr Nikolaevich , and so on . The Stanislav-sky method as practiced by Egon was incredibly demanding and took all our concentration . He made us live the parts , not only in the theater but down the street in the caf ? drinking coffee , at home , on our dates , on weekends . I had just come out of the hospital , where I had spent six weeks recovering from infectious hepatitis and reading Sinclair Lewis ' Arrow-smith , and in my weakened condition I was probably more susceptible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me the Orchard Players were going to do The Seagull and still had n't cast several parts , and I thought it would be good mental hygiene , which was about as wrong as you could get . It was n't long before Egon had us all in a state of semi-delusion about our identities . For instance he set us to writing essays on what we ( our Russian selves ) were like as children . I ( as Trepleff ) wrote a schoolboy theme which I had allegedly composed in a lyck at the age of sixteen . In its juvenile style it rather ingeniously anticipated certain things that were 62 TREPLEFF later to recur in the poem Trepleff writes for Nina in Act I , for example the solitude of the universe and the struggle between spirit and matter . Egon was quite pleased with it . There was a good deal of this kind of homework . But mostly it was a matter of Egon cajoling and browbeating us until we were harried into our Chekhovian selves . For instance he would turn to Nina , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syd who always rehearsed in leotards and a heavy white ski sweater . " Nina  --  what is Nina ? " he would growl at her , holding out his hairy hands , palms turned upward , elbows against his stomach . " Innocence . Grace . Not intelligence but intuition . A longing for  --  what ? She does n't know . Something here . " He would lay the palms of his hands fiat on his chest . " Nina  --  feel , feel ! " He made Nina put her own hands on the same place on the white ski sweater . " There 's something there  --  a desire  --  a melancholy , graceful , very feminine , elusive longing . Nina is a seagull . Something in her soars , floats over the world , but she never finds what she is looking for . Trepleff brings her a dead seagull which he has shut . She says , This seagull , I suppose that 's a symbol . Forgive me , but I do n't understand it . ' That 's the essence of Nina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Again the two hairy palms on the pectoral region . " And Nina  --  that day after Trepleff offers you the seagull  --  what do you do when you go home ? " " It is n't in the play . " " Of course it is n't in the play . But what do you do ? You 're Nina . Only you know what you do . What do you feel like doing ? " " I do n't know . Some sewing perhaps . Or read a book . " " Sewing . " He raised his clenched hands and made a goatlike sound of contempt . " No , no no no . Listen . You open the window . You look out . What do you see ? " She hesitated . " Birches . Fields . The water beyond . And  --  over the lake , gulls . " " Exactly ! " Finally he drove us into understanding what we would do even in the parts of our lives that Chekhov had n't written . " The gulls over the lake . Sunset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A melancholy , a faintly pleasant melancholy . Now you are Nina , now you are feeling it , fine . " Striding up and down the stage , he would turn suddenly on me . " Trepleff ! What are you ? A visionary . But the thing you see is not God but the gulf of human loneliness . You love and pity others because you love and pity yourself . You kill a seagull , you murder it and bring it to Nina , but you say , ' Today I was low enough to kill this seagull . I lay it at your feet ? You are a criminal in order to lay your crime at the feet of others , out of compassion for them . Essentially you are a weak character , and yet there 's a saintly streak in you . The Doomed Saint . This is very Russian ! You are not only out of Chekhov , you are also out of Dostoevski . Trepleff ! What have you read of Dostoevski ? " " Crime and Punishment . Karamazov . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would bellow , thrusting his arms toward me with palms up , trembling as though he were holding a heavy log . " Read it all , read everything in the library ! On Monday bring me a list of what you 've read ! " 1 would spend the weekend staying up until four in the morning , reading Dostoevski until my eyes were red . On Monday Egon would have forgotten all about Dostoevski . He would point one hairy hand in my direction and demand , " Trepleff . Where did you go to the university ? " I was damned if I knew . I decided that since I was a citizen of Kiev I would have gone to the University of Kiev . None of us knew whether there was a University of Kiev , but Egon succeeded in convincing me I had gone to it . " And what did you study at the University of Kiev ? " was getting the hang of it now . I had studied German philosophy , literature , and a little medicine . Mostly , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what character in Dostoevski are you most like ? " I pondered for a moment . " Prince Myshkin . " " Right ! Wonderful ! Myshkin , the saint , but also a little of the criminal in him . Ile too could kill a bird and say , ' Today I was low enough to kill this seagull . ' He too is capable of laughing with his face wet with tears . And Trepleff  --  my friend , please allow me to call you Konstantin Gavrilovich . Konstantin Gavrilovich , my friend , please tell me . " His voice dropped to a confidential rumble . " Please tell me , when you were a little boy , how did you think of your mother ? " " My mother ? " " Your mother , Mme. Arkadina . How would a little boy think of a mother who was a famous actress ? " " Well . " I had n't expected this . I had to grope a little . " How old am I ? " MacDonald Harris is a story writer and noveii.vr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leap " ) who lives in Newport Reach , California , and does a lot of sailing . He began writing during the war when he was in the merchant marine . " Three . " " Well , uh . She seemed to me  --  a strange angel . Glitters , sequins  --  smelling good  --  but distant , unattainable  --  where I could n't reach her . " " Splendid ! A little boy whose mother is always away , traveling , appearing before audiences in Moscow and Petersburg  --  and when she comes home ! " She passes through the nursery ? " As I spoke I began to see the scene clearly now , as clearly as though it had been my real childhood : " She bends over my crib , there is a glitter of jewels and a scent of patchouli  --  she says , ' My Kostya , little prince , my angel , do n't cry now , ah look , he has porridge on his face , how disgusting  --  nurse , Avdotya ! take him off and wash him  --  Kostya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm off to ' ? where the hell is she off to ? " " Yaroslavl . Splendid , but patchouli is for old ladies , Konstantin Gavrilovich . Mme. Arkadina would wear ? " he raised his arms and did n't know himself . " Irina Nikolaevna ! what would you wear ? " The dentist 's wife was brought forth and decided she would wear jasmine . There was a pause while we all imagined her bending over my crib and smelling of jasmine . Egon went on stalking back and forth on the stage . " So your mother is always in Yaroslavl , in Moscow , in Petersburg , playing in theaters . You grow up longing for a human touch , an affection to replace that of your mother . And gradually you learn to pity others who long for a human touch , and because you pity them you love them . And yet , and yet  --  you love them not as ordinary men love , but with the love of a criminal , who is also a kind of a saint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I nodded , a little wildly ? " a saint who lies under a special curse , that for him the souls of others are transparent . " I looked around me and it was true , the souls of all those students and dentists ' wives were transparent . At that moment I must really have looked doomed , because Egon stared at me with a strange smile and exulted , " Splendid , splendid ! " The hairy arms spread in an expansive gesture and then swung back together until he embraced himself . " Konstantin Gavrilovich , I congratulate you ! You are becoming yourself ! " Egon , of course , was Trigorin , Nina and Trepleff were one thing . Ah , but Trigorin ! Trigorin was a famous author , his name in the papers every day , his books translated into foreign languages . The darling of the public , beloved of a million sentimental women , and what was he interested in ? Work ! Only in work ! And what was his work ? To create people , characters , human beings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary for him to live , to have experiences . He was capable of shooting a seagull , but not to lay it at the feet of someone out of pity . Merely to see what it felt like to kill a seagull , in order to put it in a story . But what a man ! Not a human being at all but a machine for work , a machine for living , lusting , feeling , knowing , in order that it could all go into his art ! Egon really dug into the part , the character of Trigorin touched something in him that released a flood of energy . Or else he had practiced the Stanislaysky method for so long that he really became Trigorin even to himself , as he wanted us to do . His voice took on a Russian intonation , the way Chaliapin would perhaps talk if he spoke English , He strode up and down the stage with hands thrust out and his elbows on his stomach , a gorilla but an elegant gorilla in a checked shirt and burgundy waistcoat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us in his hairy bass . " Please , everybody . Places ! Let 's start from the beginning , since nobody with the possible exception of myself seems to have grasped yet what this play is about . it 's about the Russian soul , melancholy , flowers , poetry , loneliness , death ! " He held out his fierce hand , the bass voice shook and there was a catch in it almost like a tear . " Soul ! Flowers ! Loneliness ! Everybody think soul , flowers , and loneliness . Everybody ! Act one , scene one . Masha , Masha . Little turtledove , listen . I love you with all my heart and soul , but please . When they ask you why you 're wearing black and you say , ' I 'm in mourning for my life . I 'm unhappy . ' You know that line ? You have n't forgotten your lines ? Good . If you ca n't learn to act , at least try to focus your tiny little brain on learning your part . But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When you say that line , please , for me , for the sake of my rather delicate nerves , do not say it as though somebody had stuck a hatpin into your behind . Say it quite simply . Yet with tremendous emotion ! But the emotion is underneath ! It does not consist in making little trills and screeches . " Masha was a pretty sophomore girl with brown eyes who was not used to being treated this way . " First you want more emotion , then less emotion , " she quavered . " How can you say something quite simply and yet with emotion ? " It is necessary to distinguish between emotion and hysteria . First , however , it is necessary not to be a half-wit . In this respect I admit you have a certain handicap . I do not ask of you anything beyond your powers . All I ask is that you do your best , and that means DOING EXACTLY AS I SAY " ' Masha collapsed in tears and it was some time before anybody could calm her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He turned his back contemptuously on her and made another of his gestures : he cupped his hands and moved them slowly up and down in front of his chest , as though he were holding two grapefruit and trying to decide which was the larger . When he looked around they were mopping up Masha 's tears with a handkerchief and patting her on the back . He rubbed his short stiff beard and sighed . Finally she got up , they pushed her onto the stage , and Medvedenko asked her , " Why do you always wear black ? " " I 'm in mourning for my life . I 'm unhappy , " she intoned monotonously like a sleepwalker . But with terrific emotion underneath . It was exactly what Egon wanted . He could be heard rumbling softly to himself , " Ah . Ah . " Iwas unhappy too but in a different way from Masha . It was a beatific , poignant , philosophical kind of unhappiness that consisted of loving Syd or did I mean Nina ? I was a little confused on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slender legs , boyish manner , cool elfin grace whose life was so intimately intertwined with mine on the stage as well as off and yet who managed to elude me in some mysterious way in both realms . My love was hopeless , purified , and utterly devoid of selfishness . It would be wrong to say it was devoid of fleshly desire , but it was an odd fleshly desire , passive and resigned , that lingered like a sadness in the bones . It made me an excellent Trepleff . She was n't cold or unfriendly toward me , in fact we were together frequently and there was even a certain intimacy between us but she was the same with the others and it was only the easy and superficial camaraderie of the theater that would end when the play was over , or so I concluded in my pessimism . My Russian , Trepleffian pessimism . I had never been pessimistic before but now it seemed a part of my nature . I had dug into my part too , I had dug into it tooth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forgotten my way out into the air again . Trepleff was my grave . The funny thing was that in some goofy spiritual self-exacerbating way I liked it down there under the ground . It fitted me , it was restful . Anyhow there we were , Trepleff and Nina , walking back to the women 's dorm on a frosty Michigan night . It was December now and so cold it made your teeth ache . I walked at a distance of Five feet from her down the tree-lined paths of the campus , never daring to touch her or say anything of what I felt . It was enough to be with her . and I even liked the bitter cold because it provided an appropriate physical misery to go with the misery of my soul . When she left the theater she still wore the heavy white sweater and leotard but she added a black scarf that went two or three times around her neck and was still long enough to reach almost to her knees . Once I asked her if she was cold and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I was unable to find out even the most innocent physical fact about her . Perhaps she had learned to talk this way at Wellesley where she had gone before she came to Ann Arbor or perhaps she merely preferred not to discuss her physical sensations with a member of the opposite sex . Because she did think of me as a male , that was apparent from various small signs . And so ? What next ? Nothing . I was totally blissful in my misery as it was . Sometimes I even had a kind of a date with her , so to speak , that is , after rehearsal we would go to one of the student cafes on the edge of campus and drink coffee . We dutifully called each other Trepleff and Nina , as per instructions . But it did n't seem to me that Syd , or Nina , had dug quite as far into her part as I had . For one thing she had n't been sick . And then she was a drama major and thought of herself more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also that she had got interested in the theater for the wrong reason , like most college students who get interested in the theater . She liked the paraphernalia of it , the slightly risque camaraderie , the rehearsing late at night in leotards and ski sweaters , the feeling of thinking of yourself as an actress . Whereas according to the Stanislaysky method she was n't supposed to be an actress , she was supposed to be Nina . And Nina was quite simple , an intelligent , lonely , and unhappy girl , a victim . We discussed this several times when we went out for coffee , but she said of Nina , " She 's an idiot . " This sounded almost like sacrilege to me . She was Nina . I was Trepleff . Should I tell Egon ? What was I talking about ? I was really getting unhinged . Perhaps the trouble was that she was badly cast for the part . I had thought it was a good piece of casting at first but now I was n't sure . Above all Nina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would have been very difficult for Syd to be unhappy . It might have made her unhappy if Egon had browbeaten her as he did the others , Masha for instance , but he never did . He might criticize the way she delivered a line but he never told her she was a half-wit or accused her of chewing gum . The two of them seemed to communicate without talking very much ; in fact she seemed to have some kind of a special relation with him that excused her from being barked at like the rest of us . Sometimes after rehearsal it was Egon who took her to coffee at the student joints , or at least he took her somewhere . He would come out with a little twisted smile over his beard , looking like Henry VIII in the well-known portrait by Holbein . " Nina . pigeon , am I wrong or are you mine this evening ? " She would smile her own little Wellesley smile and follow him silently out the door . Through the thin walls of the theater we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long whir as it pulled away . On those nights when she went to drink coffee with Egon I would walk home alone to my boardinghouse , my hands deep in my pockets , wrapped to the nose in scarves and mufflers , the cold like a knife pain in my lungs , miserable in body and soul and loving my misery . I was drunk on cold , love , poetry , and unhappiness . Overhead the bare branches of the trees were distorted and a little wild against the starry sky : a landscape of Ed-yard Munch , Ann Arbor was Moscow , Petersburg , A Story by MacDonald Harris 65 Stockholm , a city of white nights and frozen abstract demons ; the campus lanes were the Nevsky Prospekt . White nights ! I had finally thought of a name for my insomnia . It was the title of a novel by Dostoevski . The world of artifice was real , the real world flimsy and contemptible . Through the artifice of Egon , that genius we loved and hated , I was in love not with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zarychny . Sometimes I would walk throe the frozen campus until four o'clock in the morning . It was very bad for someone who was recovering from hepatitis . The infrequent people I passed , milkmen , students going home from dates , probably did n't even know who I was . I was Trepleff , crushed under the weight of his solitude , all-pitying and all-loving , the Doomed Saint . The stars overhead winked indifferently , the cold too hit my face without understanding who I was . Finally I would go back to my rented room . Standing half-undressed in the middle of the floor I would say , " Today I was low enough to kill this seagull . I lay it at your feet . " Then , smiling , I would get into bed and go to sleep . Wth the possible exception of Nina , we all dug into our parts in this way and the play was a tremendous success . We played for nine nights and every night we were left exhausted , emotionally drained , unable even to talk to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our way to the dressing rooms . The audience was as hypnotized as we were . When the curtain came down there was a strange numb pause of perhaps thirty seconds and then they began to clap . a scattered fusillade that soon rose to a roar . It went on for ten minutes . When we took the curtain calls Egon did n't even bother to smile at the audience . He detested audiences . Over the applause he could be heard growling " Yah . Yah , " to himself like a gorilla . Egon took no pleasure in success . It was making the thing , wrenching all these students and dentists ' wives and bright little coeds out of their miserable personalities and making them do as he wanted , that interested him . It did n't interest him , it obsessed him . Ile was addicted to manipulating other human beings the way some people are addicted to alcohol . This had been apparent before , but I only grasped the full force of it that night after the play was over . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . When I came out after ungluing the wispy little Trepleff-beard and changing into my street clothes I found her still sitting on a stool on the darkened stage . In the play she wore a simple cotton dress with a wide skirt , but now she had changed back into her leotard and ski sweater . When she saw me she smiled , faintly , one side of her mouth lifting so that it made a small hard crease in her cheek . " Waiting for somebody ? " " No . " " Going to the party ? " " No . " " Then ? " Without answering she sighed , got up off the stool , wandered around the darkened stage for a while , and finally stopped in front of me and gave me a strange look . Then 1 became aware that she was bending her head slowly until at last it was resting on my shoulder . It was very unlike her . There she stood with her head on my shoulder and I found that in some manner my arms were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patted her awkwardly , consolingly , in the middle of the back . The sweater was rough under my fingers but inside it her form was slight , almost unbelievably fragile . After a moment of this she broke away and turned her head , not looking at me . " Take me somewhere . " I feverishly put on my overcoat , she wound the black scarf three times around her neck , and we went out . I did n't know what was wrung with her but I was filled with a terrific sense of impending joy , a joy that was a melancholy kind of joy on the surface because she was melancholy , but at a deeper level was exultant because in her melancholy she had for some reason , inexplicably , needed me . I realized now she had been waiting for me . We went down the street and turned in the first place we came to and ordered coffee and pastry . As it happened it was a place called the Pit because it was supposed to specialize in barbecue , but the ventilation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The barbecue was terrible but the pastry came from a Danish bakery across the street and it was the one thing in the place that was good . She took a bite of her pastry , chewed it once or twice , and then unexpectedly bent forward and propped her forehead in her hands . Great tears welled in her eyes and trickled down her cheeks and fell onto the table . After a few moments she mastered herself , got out a handkerchief and dried her cheeks , and then began mechanically mopping up the tears on the table . All this without a sound . Finally she made a little sigh that was almost half-humorous . " Masha , that half-wit . That Kewpie-doll . I never thought it would be Masha . I knew it would be someone because that 's the way he is . It lasted even longer than I thought . But Masha . That little idiot with her turned-up nose and her two eyes like raisins in a rice pudding . " The tears still welled in her eyes but her teeth were clenched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish I could go off quietly and die somewhere . No 1 do n't , I want to stay around until he realizes she 's a little plaster Betty Boop , the kind you win by knocking down milk bottles at carnivals . " It was characteristic that even with her throat so tight she could hardly speak , she called Masha by her name in the play , as Egon had made us all do . " It is n't as though I did n't know it would happen , " she went on , exhaling and talking a little more calmly . " I knew he was selfish , egotistical , cold . No , that 's wrong , he 's not cold . He 's like a huge big locomotive full of passions , but his passion is all inside himself . He needs women ? " In spite of her teeth-clenching the tears were beginning to well again : He needs women the way he needs handkerchiefs to blow his nose in . After he 's done with them he throws them away . The kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Her own handkerchief was sturdy Irish linen , expensive but durable . It was rapidly becoming saturated and I passed her my own . She thanked me by nodding , unable to speak , or at least unable to speak about anything but Egon . " He 's not interested in love . He has nothing against it , you understand . It just does n't fit in with his m  --  tier . He wants to drive people the way you drive a car . He wants to make them cry or laugh or be angry at him or fall in love with him , it does n't really matter which . If he saw me now he 'd be pleased , because he 's making me feel some emotion . He 's a genius in his way . He 's not really an egotist , you know . An egotist is satisfied with himself but he 's never satisfied . He always has to prove it all over again . Do you know what he is ? He 's a man  --  man ? " With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the word out but finally she managed it ? " a man-ip-ulator . " There was a brief silence while I imagined Egon in his apartment with Syd , driving her the way you drive a car . But mental pictures of this kind were pointless and instead I tried to offer some constructive advice . " Forget him . It 's all over now . He 's not worth it . " " Oh , he 's worth it , " she said in a weak voice , almost to herself . " But if you knew all these things ? " She lifted her shoulders and almost smiled . " Egon has a new term for giving in to temptation . He calls it not saying no to life . Does that shock you ? I 'm sorry . I was an idiot . Do you know why I really did it ? Because he made me into Nina , and Nina is an idiot . " It did n't shock me exactly . It simply made me understand what the knot of unhappiness was that had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize that you can know something and not know it , until somebody finally forces it up into the front of your mind by putting it in words as she was doing now . I was like a man who A Story by MacDonald Harris 67 has been going around all day feeling miserable and not knowing why and finally he realizes he has a toothache . But it was simple , teeth can be pulled out I was ready with the forceps of my youth , my love , my spirit of feverish self-sacrifice . The more the tooth hurt the more I anticipated the joy of it slipping easily and scientifically out of its socket . " So here I am . What am I going to do ? " I heard her inquiring more to the air around her than to me . " Do nothing . Forget he ever existed . Simply go on as you were before . " " Yes , but you see , I ca n't exactly go on as I was before . Because , even if I forget him , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She did n't look at me , but in spite of the fact that her voice was barely audible it was not devoid of a certain irony . It was a queer moment , pathetic and yet slightly farcical . It was clear that she would rather have been run over by a truck , pulverized by a meteorite , that at least would have been dramatic , anything except this old-fashioned and ludicrous predicament which only happened to maidens in Victorian novels . " 0 , that Nina , what a fool she was , " she gritted to herself after a moment . Oof . This jeering little mannikin , the relic of Egon 's driving lesson , was growing inside the elf I had loved so chastely from a distance ? But even this I took in my stride . I had n't anticipated it , even my premonitory knot of pain had n't gone that far , but if you were going to pull out a tooth it was just as easy to pull out a whopping big one . I reached across the table and pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own hand . " Look . Why not cheer up and be practical ? We 're not living in a play . It 's the age of modern science . These things are the simplest thing in the world to take care of . " I had no idea how they were taken care of but I thought I could probably find out . She seemed to be ready to leave the details to me . She slumped in her chair and almost smiled . " Do n't tell anyone what I said about Masha being a Kewpie-doli , will you ? That was stupid , stupid , stupid . " And so there in the Armpit , at a wooden table that smelled of ketchup and sour coffee , my life changed direction and shot off at an obtuse angle toward other reveries and other goals . In Syd 's despair , I realized , lay my own happiness . But it was another kind of happiness from the sentimental melancholy happiness I had known when I had walked the lonely campus thinking of her , 68 TREPLEFF in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now I saw that the thing was simple . much simpler than I had ever dreamed . I did n't have to be Trepleff . I did n't want to be Trepleff . Why had I let that gorilla in a waistcoat walk all over me ? I had been sick  --  that was the only explanation of it . I had been sick the whole time . I had rehearsed and played the whole damned play with a fever and it had made me susceptible to the manipulations of that provincial Svengali . The Doomed Saint ! What stupidity . Nobody was doomed , I was n't doomed and neither was Syd . All we had to do was stop acting like a couple of idiots and do the practical thing and we would be happy like everybody else . Syd herself was in no mond to do the practical thing . She had fallen into a curious passivity which was perhaps only a biological reflex of females in her predicament , intended to stimulate the sympathy and protection of the nearest male . Anyhow it worked . I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or rather I found that the sheer and unalloyed happiness of saving her had somehow fallen to my lot . Means were found to remove the unwanted token of Egon 's esteem from consideration . After some searching a suitable doctor was located in the nearby town of Ypsilanti , which was popularly deemed more appropriate than Ann Arbor for such squalors . The horrid deed was actually performed in a motel . Syd was just sick enough for me to feel protective and for her to feel grateful , and not sick enough to frighten either of us . She hemorrhaged a little more than she should have and the Ypsilanti doctor showed me how to give her plasma , being careful to get all the air out of the tube and observing sterility precautions . I watched her all that night ; I had n't slept for what seemed like a week but the fatigue only left me keen , piercingly awake , and even more competent , although I noticed a slight tendency to hallucinations of a harmless sort . ( Voices kept saying , " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) From time to time she woke up and I applied cool cloths to her brow , fed her soup with a spoon , and read her Gerard Manley Hopkins . She smiled at me a little weakly , still with wry irony at finding herself the Sadder But Wiser Girl in the song . Weak in this way , passive and drained of the energy that had been her most charming quality , she was less pretty but I loved her more . When she went to sleep I read Hopkins myself ( " It is the blight man was born for , it is Margaret you mourn for " ) or just sat and smoked cigarettes . Sometimes when she woke up I would find her staring at me silently with tears in her eyes , and I would smooth her hair and talk in a quiet voice to her . I was in command of the situation , medically , psychologically , and emotionally . I was no longer sorry for myself and I did n't hate anybody . I did n't even hate Egon , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . Egon-Trigorin had needed the experience for his art ; he was a machine for having experiences and Syd had got caught in the machinery . It was an unfortunate mishap but one without sentimental significance , an industrial accident . As for the so-called moral aspects of the situation , to hell with them . I did n't consider Syd any more guilty than if she had got her skirt caught in a threshing machine . This was partly because I loved her but partly because in my new role as Arrowsmith I was totally objective about suffering and its causes . I knew my mission now , it was to solace the victims of industrial accidents and make them happy again , and be happy doing it . The next morning I took Syd back to her dormitory . The house mother in the dorm never knew about it . The house mother thought she was visiting her parents in Evanston . Her parents never knew about it . Her roommates in the dorm never knew about it . Nobody knew about it . Acouple of weeks after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes the whole two weeks , tears of gratitude at first and then tears of real love . I knew it was real love because Syd would have preferred to conceal the emotion if she could . But it was too much to conceal and it came out in the tears and in various other signs that in my Arrowsmithian objectivity I recognized as unmistakable . She was in a weakened condition just as I had been with the hepatitis , but I was well now and she was the one who had emotions . And yet I loved her as much as I ever had or more , I was very gentle with her , understanding , solicitous , consnling , and did n't touch her for several weeks except to kiss her lightly . I waited patiently while the broken pieces of her womanhood healed , and left to herself in this way she finally came to such a high fine pitch of desire that I was practically overwhelmed , one night , with one arm still in my shirt . I had suffered a long time , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Neva , but it was worth it . She was cured and so was I. It was as though all the rest of it , Egon , the Orchard Players , The Seagull , and the whole goddam sophomoric thing , had never happened . I had saved her , and we were young and in love in a rented room with gas plate in Ann Arbor , Michigan . The cynics were wrong and virginity could be restored .
