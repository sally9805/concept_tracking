Someone once asked Harold Ross , founder , editor , and professionally terrible-tempered boss of The New Yorker , what would become of the magazine after his death . " It will go its own goddam way , I guess , " he replied . Ross was not quite right . Last week , nine years after his death from cancer , The New Yorker was still trying to go Ross 's way . But one vital element was missing : the quality of editorial goddamishness that Ross himself gave the magazine . <P> From the figure it cuts in the accounting department , things could hardly be better : circulation is up 81,500 , to 427,000 , since Ross died . The sophistication that used to be found in the wit of contributors has been successfully transferred to the advertising pages , which are the glittering showcase of the Madison Avenue specialty shop , inhabited by more Virginia hams and truffled pate , glittering gems and vintage brandies than any other major magazine . Last year 's $17,751,924 gross and $1,985,785 profit set alltime records , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1925 , is worth $1,440 in 1960 , figuring stock splits . But has success spoiled The New Yorker ? <P> Middle-Aged Spread . In the old days , The New Yorker gibed at success and played to an intellectual-not a financial - snobbery . The tone was waspish and metropolitan . Ross scorned the opinions of " the old lady in Dubuque , " * but the present magazine , like many of its ads , seems aimed directly at suburban ladies from coast to coast . Last month , after 31 years , The New Yorker finally abolished its New York regional edition . <P> Many of its demanding fans , and even some of its own writers , sigh that the magazine has become afflicted with middle-aged spread . Profiles that once ran in two parts now run in three , and in the case of S. N. Behrman 's recent seven-part profile on Max Beerbohm , a good-sized short story might have been told in the space it took Behrman just to arrive at his first meeting with Beerbohm , outside Rapallo . William Shawn , Ross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drink : " The stories just seem to get longer-I do n't know why . ' ' <P> A slight , polite , shy man of 52 , Shawn was groomed for years to take over . An old New Yorker hand recalls Shawn 's arrival on the staff in 1933 : " To him , it was like entering the priesthood . " Says James Thurber , the peerless humorist , now 65 , who chronicled the earlier era in The Years with Ross : " There was no question that Ross wanted Shawn to succeed him , and the whole staff was pulling for him , too . " It still is . Shawn is a gentle boss , and so sensitive to writers ' feelings that he once called Drama Critic Kenneth Tynan in Havana to ask permission to change a comma . But this punctilious deference to writers ' words may explain the magazine 's increased windiness . Both fact and fiction pieces tend to run on interminably . As one writer puts it , " Everybody 's pieces but mine are too long . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
