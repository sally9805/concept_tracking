On the rare occasions when writer Truman Capote agrees to submit to a television interview , it is usually because he has something that he wants to say . Last week , when he appeared ( for the first time ) on Johnny Carson 's Tonight show , he wasted little time in getting to the point . " I have a theory , " announced the author of In Cold Blood , " about the murder of Martin Luther King . " <P> So , of course , does almost everybody else , but Capote 's credentials make him worth listening to-wild though his theory may be . The FBI , he says , is looking for the wrong man . James Earl Ray , alias Eric Starvo Gait , was indeed in on the assassination plot-which Capote believes was carried out by " leftists , not rightists , " for political gain . Ray did not , however , kill Martin Luther King . " I have studied his record very carefully , and in my experience with interviewing what I call homicidal minds Capote has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , he 's simply a man not capable of this particular kind of very calculated and cruel , and exact and precise kind of crime . " <P> <P> In Capote 's reconstruction of the crime , in fact , Ray 's only function was to throw the FBI off the assassin 's trail , first by assuming the name of Eric Starvo Gait ( " My theory is that there are two Eric Starvo Gaits " ) , and finally by planting his fingerprints on the gun that was later to be used for killing King . <P> This was a setup , " Capote believes . The central factor of what happens is that , after the assassination , this assassin rushes out of the rooming house and what does he do ? He does a very amazing , unusual thing . He takes a suitcase and very carefully props it up in front of a store . And in this suitcase there is a shotgun , very carefully left . And what is on it is Mr. James Earl Ray 's fingerprints . " <P> And where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Capote believes he was killed " and disposed of " at least ten days before the assassination . " He did n't quite understand , " said Capote with a grimace , " what his part in the plot was going to be . "
