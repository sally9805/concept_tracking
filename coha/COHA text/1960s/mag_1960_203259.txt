Corporate profits are on a steady rise almost across the board , so the first earnings reports for the quarter ending in December showed last week . <P> International Business Machines ' quarterly earnings of $2.40 a share ( v. last year 's $1.91 ) hiked the company 's 1959 total to a record $7.97 a share . General Foods Corp. , the nation 's largest food processor , rose 17.3% to set a new quarterly record of $1.12 a share v. 95 a share last year . Bulova Watch Co. ticked its way to an impressive 69% hike for the first nine months , largely on the strength of higher earnings in its third quarter ( 64 v. 34 ) . <P> American Steel Foundries hit a $1.05-a-share pace , nearly triple its 1958 performance . Beech Aircraft profits soared 63% ( $1.41 a share v. 88 ) on a 49% rise in sales , and Diamond Alkali Co. chalked up earnings of $1.03 v. 88 for last year . In Manhattan , Chairman George Romney led off the auto parade by announcing that American Motors pre-tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million earned a year ago , although the net may be less , because last year American Motors still had a loss carryover to offset taxes . <P> Even companies whose quarterly earnings dropped because of the steel strike were generally able to clear the year in good shape ; e.g. , Allied Chemical raised its 1959 earnings 46% ( to $2.51 a share ) despite a quarterly drop of 4% in profits . But nothing could save Douglas Aircraft Co. from a hefty 1959 loss as a result of heavy charge-offs against its new DC-8 jet transport program . The firm reported a loss of $33.8 million , compared with a $16.8 million profit in 1958 . However , it expects peak deliveries of DC-8s in 1960 to boost overall sales to more than $1 billion-and profits with it .
