" I hope you live to be 500 , because if anything happens to you , I 'll be the ugliest man in the world . " <P> Few baseball players get away with talking to their manager like that . But when the player is Mickey Mantle , Yogi Berra will take all the lip he hands out . At 32 Mantle is at least a couple of steps slower than when he broke into the American League 13 seasons ago . He has a chronically weak right shoulder and his knees are crosshatched with scars from cartilage operations-the most recent of them last winter . He runs as if he were on stilts , and he winces every time he swings a bat . But Mickey Mantle is still the most valuable player around . <P> Last week the Yankees were trailing the American League-leading Baltimore Orioles by only .006 points , and the reason , in a word , was Mantle . Mickey 's .323 batting average was the second best in the league . He had hit one out of every five Yankee home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led the team in R.B.I.s ( 61 ) and , naturally , in walks ( 59 ) . In two crucial games last week , he demonstrated why , in case anybody had forgotten , the Yankees pay him $100,000 a year . Against the Orioles , Mickey beat out an infield hit , moved to second when Tom Tresh walked and then set sail , aching legs and all , for third . He slid under the tag with a stolen base ; Tresh , playing follow the leader , dashed to second . When Joe Pepitone singled , both runners scored - and the Yankees beat the Orioles 2-0 . <P> Washington Pitcher Alan Koch was Mantle 's next victim . In the Yankee fifth , with two on , two out , and the Senators leading 3-1 , Mantle stepped up to the plate . First base was open , and Koch was in no mood to take unnecessary chances . His first three pitches were off the plate , and Mickey took them all . " You ca n't let Mantle beat you , " Koch said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count on Mickey , I did n't want to let him beat me . " So Koch threw another ball , low and inside . Only Mantle did not take this one . He creamed it 295 ft. to right field for a double that tied up the game . Once more Pepitone followed with a hit-and the Yankees won , 6-3 . In the clubhouse , an hour later , poor Koch was still muttering : " You ca n't let Mantle beat you . "
