Anxious to unload their embarrassing guest , Israeli authorities last week packed Convicted Soviet Spy Robert Soblen onto an El Al plane for a U.S.-bound trip via Athens and London . But as the plane approached London , Soblen stabbed himself in the wrist and stomach with a steak knife , forcing British authorities to take him on as a hospital patient . The delay that Soblen won by his dramatic suicide attempt immediately created a legal tangle . Though the Home Office insisted that Soblen was not legally in Britain , two barristers-one a Labor M.P.-obtained a writ of habeas corpus delaying his departure at least until after a court hearing next week . Soblen himself applied for political asylum in Britain , and at week 's end had recovered sufficiently to be moved to London 's Brixton Prison .
