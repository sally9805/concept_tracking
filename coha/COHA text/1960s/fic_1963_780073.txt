 | Storm baffled him , both physically and mentally . He was incongruous with his huge bulk , the near violence of his enormous head , sheathed in its unruly mop of red hair and beard . Particularly was Sam impressed by the remarkable softness of the man 's voice . Yet he knew from his sailing experience that Storm could let out a whoop and a roar that would echo across a mile of water . He had never seen the Icelander violent , or anything but courteous and kind . Yet now , as he sat next to him on the speeding plane , he wondered what Storm would do if he could not have his way . On the surface Philip was gentleness itself , like a great St. Bernard . But now , somehow , that gentleness seemed threatened . There was a peculiar sense of impending crisis in the little cabin . This magnificence , this almost theatrical docility , he thought , might be as specious as Kara 's suave management of his emotions , back there in the evenings at Tomhagen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , to cut out the reflection of the cabin lights . Looking down into the dark he made out the faint yellow tapestry of a city glittering in the distance . A smaller fog of lights lay beyond . He was puzzled . Though he had never flown over central Maine before he knew that there were few cities on the route from the Moosehead area to Keezar Lake . Not one , in fact . " Charles must be off course , " he said conversationally . " We did n't pass those.cities down there on our way north . " " Playing safe , " the big man returned casually . " Taking a roundabout course along the commercial routes . Even Charles could get lost flying direct in this country . " Kara smiled slightly . More than ever she reminded Sam of the two Siamese cats she had exhibited to him at the Pond . Such poise they had , but you never felt comfortable with them . He knew that she had them with her now , and wondered why . Storm had leaned over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he announced . " We 'll turn south as soon as he makes his departure from the airport beacon . " Sam tried to banish his uneasiness . " Sounds sensible , " he admitted . " But you could have waited till morning , do n't you think ? Suppose we do n't find Keezar Lake at all ? No lights , no beacons . Nothing . " Storm chuckled . " You were like a cat on a griddle , Sam . Nothing would do but to get you back there tonight . It was unfortunate about the engines , of course . I 'm sorry for that . But Charles said it could n't be helped . " " That 's what he said , but ? " Sam left the sentence dangling . For the first time he had detected a different look on the massive face . Was there something he had n't told him ? " You underestimate Charles , " Kara remarked slowly . It was the first time she had entered the conversation . Sam remembered the road map by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keezar the Monday before . Bangor must be ioo miles or more to the southeast of the Moosehead area , where Tomhagen Pond was located . From Bangor Keezar would lie almost as far to the south and west , over against the New Hampshire line . What Storm had said about picking up the Bangor beacon and making a departure on it made sense enough , provided Charles took a ninety degree turn . If he did do this , he must do it almost at once . Bangor was directly below now . A veteran air traveler , Sam was sure he could detect that turn . He held himself alert for it . The minutes went by , strung out to ten and then fifteen . The plane had not banked onto a new course . It had remained in level flight . Sam screened his face again and looked back toward the receding lights of the city . They were drifting astern on the same line they had been on all along . No change of course . It was a perfect check . They had lied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Something was wrong . They were not taking him back to Keezar at all .  | mind bit into the shocking revelation in scientific fashion , sizing up the small , significant facts and changing his thinking to suit . Humanly , he might have given the benefit of the doubt to the Storms , apparently so kind to him . But that was not Sam 's way when confronted with factual evidence . Here was a problem involving his own safety , to be faced at once . Bits of evidence began to fall into place : Kara 's mysterious attitude in the past hour , the all-day delay to " fix " the ailing engine , the complete lack of concern at taking off into the night to reach a small lake in the wilderness with no landing aids at all . He considered these things as a group and decided that all of them must have been intentional ? planned in advance , fitted into a single scheme . There had been nothing the matter with the engine . Charles , introduced to him as a former pilot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actor , too . What else might he be ? Sam saw now that Storm could have got him back to Keezar Lake in daylight perfectly , but had had no intention of doing so . The easterly gale that had kept them at Tomhagen a day too long had been a good and unexpected break for Storm . It had increased the urgency of Sam 's departure . But for some reason they needed to take him away at night and so it had been necessary to invent the trouble with the engine . Why was this ? Plainly so that they could take him somewhere else without his identifying the route or destination . Sam held himself motionless . No need to let them know of his suspicions yet . He had to size up his situation first , doing a little play-acting on his own account . It flashed through his mind that this might be a practical joke . Storm was the kind for it , perhaps . But no . The big Icelander was a scientist like himself , a mineralogist . He knew that Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He knew , too , that he was the Director of Research at a key labo- ratory in the Air Force chain . People do not play practical jokes on the government . Sam canvassed the situation calmly . Did Storm have some further information about him that he should not have ? For instance , that he was due to conduct a vital meeting on that Monday that was to unveil a great advance in the U.S. defense arsenal ? Certainly he could not know this from anything Sam had told him . If he did know it , how did he ? Instantly , this opened up an alarming new train of thought . Who , really , was this man ? Who was Kara ? Charles ? What were they up to ? A scientist in Sam 's position , charged with full knowledge of the country 's innermost secrets , must forever be suspicious , on his guard . He knew now that he was in trouble . Not only he , but the project for which he had the major responsibility . For his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at once . Cautiously , he glanced at his host again . The expression on the huge hairy face had changed in the last few minutes . It was like Kara 's now  --  secretive , faintly jubilant . The mask of open friendliness had been discarded . Storm looked at him with a disarming smile , then got up , ducking his head to avoid collision with the cabin roof , and strode aft . He came back shortly with an armload of blankets , handed one to Kara and another to Sam , then folded himself into his seat again and drew a third blanket over his prodigious legs . " You may want to nap , " he said . " It will be rather late when we get in . " The statement was a full admission ; it clinched the matter . The scientist sat up , pushing the blanket aside . He turned and stared down through the darkened window again . Several more towns were spread out beneath and a glow on the horizon suggested a good sized city . " Portland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then , aloud to Storm , " Where are you taking me ? " The big Icelander looked at Kara . Her purple eyes were gleaming in the half light . " Tell him , Philip . "  | Storm kept his voice as it had been , low and unhurried . " We are following orders , Sam . That you must believe . We have no choice . " Bowden held himself in check . It was futile to yell at them , for it would only prove to them that they had him on the run . But the shock was tough . He had never been betrayed by a friend before , by anybody . Was it possible that this was really happening to him now ? He huddled back against the window , ignoring them . The whole environment had taken on an ominous hostility : the plane , the people , even the darkness , as if this were not America at all but an enemy country . There was no doubt what country . For ten years he had been concerned with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of electronic circuits and master plans and military conferences . Now , suddenly , incredibly , in the midst of a holiday friendship , the enemy was with him , personally , bodily , surrounding him , in complete control of his destiny . He was actually in a war that up to now he had merely talked about . His eyes traveled over the shadowy interior of the Robin . The name had become a travesty . Sam visualized in the darkness the luxurious arrangements , the carpet in the aisle , the adjustable airline seats with their fine upholstery , the chaste , matte surface of the chromium trim  --  all expressing so perfectly the generous , rather bizarre hospitality that Storm had affected . None of it had aroused his slightest suspicion . Why should it have ? Storm , as he had known for some time , had risen to a rather prominent position as a scientific advisor to the government . He was often mentioned in the papers . And now , this same man was making off with him against his will , saying only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The whole thing was incomprehensible , Sam 's emotions told him . His earlier association with the big Icelander , years before at the international canoe meets , had placed the man as a brilliant sportsman and a talented scientific mind , absolutely nothing more . Now , Sam 's cold logic cut through sentiment . He realized what a dirty mess he was involved in.  | He had heard about trusted employees of the government who were actually discovered to be members of the enemy conspiracy . Somehow , some way , he had fallen into the power of one of these . He got up , and murmuring an apology , climbed over Storm 's legs and reached the aisle . The big man seemed to have dropped off to sleep . Kara had turned toward the front and was reading by a small spotlight in the wall . Sam glanced over her shoulder and saw that the pages of her book were not in English . Beside her , on the companion seat , were the two Siamese cats in their carrying basket . They were lying curled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It flashed across his mind that this must be some kind of a Pavlovian experiment . Their perfect discipline , their extraordinary performances that he had been treated to at Tomhagen , indicated a deep purpose of some kind . Were even the cats a part of the plot ? Quietly Sam strolled up the aisle toward the dark cockpit . If he was careful he might get a look at the instrument panel and possibly tell what course the plane was on . He might even interfere with Charles if he was clever enough . Charles , however , had thought of this , too . As Sam approached , the door simply swung shut in his face , and the lock snapped . He stood for a moment irresolute , facing the panel of finegrained wood . That move of his had n't been very bright . You must use your head with these people . For God 's sake , he thought in sudden anguish , is it so much harder to face this problem than the infinitely more complicated ones in the Lab ? Countless captives had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing it . Kara 's sharp voice cut in over the hum of the engines . " Does it surprise you , Sam , that friends you trusted have turned against you ? What simple people you Americans are ! We have n't turned against you . We were never for you . A bright young man like you should know that . " Sam threw his shoulders back and moved past her down  | the aisle . At least he could refuse to get drawn into an insulting debate . But when he looked back she was deep in her book again . He was so much furniture . He reached the rear of the cabin and opened the door of the tiny toilet , slammed it again . There was one thin chance . Opposite it , on a long bench , stood the array of radio instruments he had seen and admired the first day he had entered the Robin . The equipment was fully familiar to him  --  a standard type of short-wave transmitter and receiving unit found in many government aircraft . He knew how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might just possibly start it up and send something out without being noticed . No matter what he sent it was sure to be picked up by half a dozen airports and military bases dotted around the countryside . Just an unexplained word or two or a call for help and somebody would get curious and follow up on it . With fingers that shook , he was ashamed to note , he flipped a switch . Its tiny sound was drowned by the muffled roar of the engines forward . A meter hand swung up encouragingly . He waited a moment . The transmitter was " hot . " Rapidly , if clumsily , he tapped out , in half remembered code , the universal SOS signal , then followed it with a succinct mention of his own name . Then , " Seized by enemy , Bowden . Seized by enemy . SOS ? " Sam glanced hurriedly up the aisle . Storm 's legs were fantastically hitched over his chair arm ; he was patently asleep . Kara 's head was still bowed over her book . Shaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rattled the door of the toilet , opened and closed it to indicate he had just come out , and returned to his seat . He climbed over Storm carefully , without disturbing him and let himself down into his own seat . Had he done it ? Had he got word out in spite of them ? He sat rigid for a few minutes , then relaxed a little . Outside , everything was pitch dark now . No more towns under- neath . The ship seemed suspended , motionless . Were they over the ocean ? It was fifteen minutes later , at least , when the Icelander stirred and grunted , as if waking up . His voice drifted gently to Sam 's ear . " That was a clever message you sent , back there , " he said admiringly . " Hate to tell you this , Sam , but Charles has the master switch to the radio antenna up there beside him in the cockpit . It was shut off , of course . " " You mean  --  I did n't get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by thought transference , my boy . " For a minute this sudden blow took the wind out of him . " You sat there and waited for me to do it ! That 's  --  dam-nable ! " Storm chuckled . " It 's a long ride and we would n't want you to get bored . " Rage burned in the scientist again . " If I 'm so important to the military as you think I am , " he shouted , " do n't you suppose they 'll start looking for me as soon as I 'm late ? " The Icelander untangled himself and sat up , as if it was the hardest thing he had to do . " Of course they will . You know the breed as well as I do . They will huddle and confer and give all sorts of wild stories to the papers , and then bury themselves in elaborate secrecy and endless red tape . Do n't think we have n't studied them for years . We know exactly what they 'll do . The one thing they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a silver case and offered Sam a cigarette , then lit it for him . " The FBI does n't work that way . " " No . But by the time they are mobilized you 'll be beyond reach . " Wildly it crossed Sam 's mind that he might start a fire in the plane and force Charles to come down to save their lives , then discarded the idea as childish . These people were not amateurs . They had thought of everything . " So I 'm go- ing to Russia , " he threw at Storm . " What makes you think I wo n't escape ? " An idle remark at this point , of course , but a good probe . " I 'm sure you will try , Sam , " Storm agreed pleasantly . " Matter of fact , we 'd be disappointed if you did n't . A mind like yours , working on such a problem , is one of the things we most want to study . Indeed , it 's a principal reason for taking you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everything . Storm patted his arm with his great hand and got up . " Now , " he suggested smoothly , " why do n't you settle down and do some thinking ? As you see , you are at a disadvantage just now . See what you can figure out for the future . " With this effrontery he turned and strode up the aisle to the cockpit door , unlocked it with his own key , and disappeared into the pilot 's compartment . Sam held himself very still , in the throes of a severe revulsion . This was the man he had trusted . This was the man whose blandishments had completely disarmed him . If he had n't fallen for his elaborate hospitality , that first day when they had met at Keezar Lake , he would n't be here now . Flying to where , a captive , kidnaped ? Over the ocean , apparently  --  to what ? Sam shook himself , recognizing panic  --  the one thing that a captive must not allow himself if he hopes to survive . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First thing to do was to review the whole affair , search out his mistakes and alert himself against making any more . For his own peace of mind , too , it was important to decide whether he had left any clues . The Laboratory would start looking for him soon and find whatever clues there were . There was a bare chance that , wherever they imprisoned him , he might find means to communicate and so tip off his rescuers . He did not realize , as he considered this , how grossly he was underestimating the enemy . There was , however , one immediate hope . The plane  | could not go on forever . Even this one , which he recognized as some late model Grumman amphibian , must land eventually for refuelling . He must be ready to take advantage of the split-second chance for escape when it did .  | IT HAD all begun back in Arkwright 's office at ETI at the end of September . As president of Eastern Technological Institute , on Harvard 's west flank in Cambridge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trusted friend . The Reading Laboratory of Electronics , across the city , was operated by ETI for the Air Force on vital defense work . As its Director of Research , Sam held one of the key posts in the American military effort . With Sam in the middle , the whole Laboratory staff had been beating their heads for months against the complications of the " Missile F " designs  --  fantastically complicated and tricky , full of snarls with Air Force personnel . It was a day-and-night job against what Sam and his men felt was a senseless deadline . But that was the way the Pentagon set things up . They were constantly phasing out some important weapons system , then yelling bloody murder to civilian  | technologists and executives the country over to force a new one through . Sam , driven to distraction by these tactics , had allowed himself a bit of temper over the interference of certain Air Force inspectors with the scheduling of Missile F components . He had thrown his weight around , insisting that the Lab be left strictly alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Either that , or you wo n't get any missile at all , " he had grimly informed a roomful of Washington brass . Next thing he knew he was on the carpet in Arkwright 's office on the river bank , for the first time in his ten years at Reading . He was bloody but unbowed . The president grinned up at him from behind his polished mahogany desk . He was relaxed and friendly . When he spoke he pitched into the middle of the problem . " Sam , how old are you ? " " Thirty-two last November loth . Thirty-three next month on the same date , Doctor Arkwright . " " Oh , come off it ! " Arkwright chided him goodnaturedly . " Sit down , light up your pipe and put your feet up on my desk . And for heaven 's sake , stop telling me what my name is . You 've always called me John . ' " Sam subsided into a chair but kept his pipe in his pocket and his feet on the floor . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arwkright appraised him keenly . The boy 's got everything , he said to himself  --  looks , presence , competence . If he just was n't quite so stubborn ! Sam sat waiting quietly . He did n't look stubborn . His fair hair gave him a permanent air of good-natured friendliness . His gray eyes never hesitated to look candidly into yours . He carried his trim body with the firmness of years of good conditioning in amateur sports . He was of medium height , on the wiry side , so that one could imagine him taking quick , decisive action in any emergency . His face was tanned and was set off perfectly by a soft gray suit that any tailor would be proud of , though it had  | come from a department store . Sam instinctively knew how to dress himself for the dignity and range of his position . He was what is often called the " despair of women , " for so far he would have none of them . The despair , too , thought Arkwright , of the Pentagon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he began , as if he were disposing of a routine matter of administration . Arkwright had plenty of dignity of his own , and diplomacy , too . He had a delicate problem in Sam just now , and must play his hand with care . Sam would n't stand for cajoling . " Thirty-two , going on thirtythree , " he said pleasantly . " D' you realize what that means , Sam ? Twenty years younger than I am and you 're already calling the turn in the most critical field lab in national defense . That 's genius , and you 've only started . What you may be doing in another twenty years may have repercussions on the whole of civilization . " Sam 's eyes were on the floor . Where was this leading ? The president leaned forward . " I 'm not trying to compliment you ; you do n't need it . But there 's no denying you 're important to all of us . What happens if you go sour ? " He waited , but Sam did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit and take it . His friend went on calmly . " You 've been getting hard to live with lately , they tell me . You 've ruffled some of our friends in Washington and they 've beefed to me about it . Some of their stuffed shirts even wonder if you would be better in another assignment , not quite so sensitive . I 've told them No . ETI is running this end of the show and intends to continue until its contracts run out . " He paused and swung back in his swivel chair , which made a plaintive squeak . Sam smiled , remembering that John kept it that way on purpose . Arkwright swung and looked out of the window , studying the small waves on the Charles River . A couple of Harvard boys sliced the water cleanly in a wherry , going downstream .  | " Well , I have another assignment for you , Sam . Right now . " " I ca n't ? " Sam began , involuntarily . " I want you to take a week off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . " " It 's impossible , " Sam objected , sitting up . " The Missile F acceptance meeting is scheduled for next week . " " I 'll telephone Washington and have them put it off , " the president said blandly . " I wish you would n't , John , " the scientist demurred . " I 'll get hold of myself , I promise . Delay now would throw the Lab into confusion . " Arkwright changed tactics skillfully . " All right , Sam . If you wo n't go voluntarily I 'll make it an order . I 'm your boss , you know . And I 'll tell you where to go , as well . That will be an order , too . " He paused and chuckled . " Sounds as if I was an ogre , does n't it ? What I mean is , I know a wonderful place where you can rest up and have fun . " Sam smiled in spite of himself . You could n't get mad at John Arkwright . When he gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president had pulled open a drawer and tossed a road map of New England on his desk . " See this , now , " he said . Sam leaned forward . " No . Come around here where you look at it right side up . " Searching with his finger he found what he wanted . " Here it is . Keezar Lake , right on Maine 's western border next the White Mountains . Fine hotel here . Silsbee 's Inn . He 's a queer duck but you 'll love him ? " Sam interrupted . " John , I ca n't go now . Honest . Please . Not this next week . That meeting ? " " The meeting 's already been postponed . We 'll move it two weeks ahead to the 17th . " He consulted a calendar on his desk . " Next week , fix up your commitments . Delegate , put off  --  whatever you have to do . You 'll leave the 8th or 9th or so and be up there a week , then come back for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Air Force and all of  | them sweat till you 're ready . That 's one trouble with you . You let them choose the battleground and the time . Now you choose them for once . Believe me , it will work wonders for that bunch . They need it . Especially those civilians in the Pentagon . " He swung his chair again and got up , standing by the window . " Here , look out here . You see that water ? Does n't it make you want to sail ? " " It sure does , " Sam agreed . " It sure does . " " All right , then . Go up there to Keezar . Loaf , make friends . It 's the end of the season . Only the diehards will be left , the quality . Silsbee 'll have time for you himself . He 's an old crony of mine . I get up there every year , you know . I 'll phone him you 're coming and he 'll roll out the red carpet for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the river . He seemed rejuvinated already . Arkwright put his hand on the younger man 's shoulder . " You know , Sam , your trouble could be you do n't know enough about people . " " I deal with a good many . " " Sure . On your own terms . But I mean people , strangers , any old person you happen to meet . Making friends out of whole cloth . Creating an impression just for its own sake . Learning how other people think . " " I guess I have n't been interested . " " Nonsense ! You just do n't realize that anybody is worth knowing but your own kind . You remember that television interview they put you through last year ? " Sam remembered vividly . It was the most painful thing he 'd ever done . The reporter had tried to dig him out and failed , had ended up doing most of the talking himself . " I saw that guy afterward , " Arkwright said , being cruelly frank . " He said , Deliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' It was a neat summing up of all of us , here . I committed his remarks to memory , almost , to help me understand my own job better . What he said went some- thing like this : So many of these fellows are colorless , ingrowing people who make very little impression except on each other . They do have one great area of genius , I admit that . But the man in the street does n't have the remotest idea of the scientist 's mind , its enormous discipline and concentration and its extraordinary exclusion of all common human understanding . How can I present that kind of a blank on TV ? ' " The room was silent for a moment . " That 's pretty bad , is n't it ? " Sam admitted finally . " Am I really that way , John ? " " Well , you are . We all are , I guess . And we 'll get completely off on the moon if we do n't watch out . That 's why I want you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " There was no further argument . He would go to the lake as soon as he put his affairs in order . As he left Arkwright 's office the president tossed one more bomb after him . " Maybe we can get you over that fantastic fear you have of women , too , " he remarked cheerfully . " I know . You just do n't like ' em . Well , why do n't you try ? More than half the world is female , you know . " That had been a stunner . Romance was one thing Sam had made up his mind he would n't have . Ten days later he was on his way to Maine in his battered little British car , which he tenderly called " The Nutrino . " To his surprise he was quite reconciled to a sudden vacation in the woods . He started out determined not to unbend to anybody , in spite of John Arkwright , least of all to some strange girl . If he could get hold of a boat and sail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his resolution faltered . People were so nice to him that he was at first bewildered and then charmed , and his natural sunny nature began to come out . Sam left his office in the restricted section at Reading on the morning of Monday , October to , telling his secretary ,  | Miss Amelia Burton , that he would be back the following Sunday without fail . Miss Burton looked at him wistfully as he paused in the doorway to say goodbye . " You know , Dr. Bowden , " she murmured , blushing furiously , " I just wish I were going with you . " He ducked out fast , in full retreat . Never had Miss Burton , by word or look , intimated such an unorthodox desire in the long years of her painfully constant loyalty . He knew she had n't meant to be forward . But still , it was a dreadful thought . The memory of her crimson face propelled him down the hall and up the long flight of steps that led to the huge parking area . His stuffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Navy 's Commander Pearson , nearly laying him flat . The Commander had never been more than a nodding acquaintance before but he picked himself up , grinning . " Gee whiz , Doc , " he cried , as Sam paused , confused . " That must be some vacation you 're heading out on . Good luck ! " As Sam unlocked his little car and got in , it hit him that Pearson had called him " Doc . " Not three people at the Lab had ever done that , least of all the Navy . What had happened ? Somebody must have spread it around that he was taking a week off . He had been extraordinarily lighthearted that morning , he remembered . Several people had wished him well : Kenyon , the pleasant guard at the main gate ; the grimy gas station attendant somewhere in rural New Hampshire , who had pulled the dipstick out of The Nutrino 's oil sump and humorously bawled him out for neglecting his lubrication . A woman at a wayside store , who called him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to have anything to do in the world . All of them had been pleasant and seemed glad that he was alive . Next thing he knew nature was taking a hand . He could n't help noticing that the fall foliage was wonderful and the blue of the distant foothills a grandeur he had not known ex- isted . In his delighted absorption with his surroundings , The Nutrino 's noisy pleas for help had gone unnoticed . Halfway up a long hill the little car jerked , died and stood still . Sam climbed out onto the dusty road he had chosen and peered in at the watch-charm engine . Few scientists are engine-wise , Sam prominent among them . " Havin ' trouble ? " An oldish man in an ancient truck had hauled up beside him . He was dressed in overalls and a greasy locomotivedriver 's cap with a long black visor . Sam looked up and smiled tentatively . " I must have run out of oil , " he said lamely . The man let himself down to the road and put a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , " he opined . " You run out of a main bearin ' , if I ai n't mistaken . " He extricated himself from the engine space and looked Sam over . " Goin ' to Silsbee 's , ai n't you . " It was a statement . Sam nodded . " Thought so , with that furrin car . Name 's Gould . I run a g'rage up to Keezar . Want me to haul you in ? " Ten minutes later the unresisting Nutrino was jerking along at the end of a piece of chain and Sam was ignominiously steering a following course as best he could . Gould went at a fast clip and Sam had his hands full . The native stopped only once , to shout back , " You makin out ? " Sam waved him on . He was ashamed to ask him to slow down the tow . In the crisp October twilight he was at last deposited at the Inn . The Nutrino had been shunted off at Gould 's ramshackle shop at the head of the lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old fellow told the clerk , throwing Sam 's bags and briefcase on the floor . " Come a ' git your car tomorrer some time . It 'll be done , " he added to Sam , and left . Now Gould , he thought , sitting there in the plane , might be the first real mark on his trail . He had liked the old guy ,  | and in the light of what happened later , Gould might be able to give the rescuers some help . Bowden was tired after his wild ride at the end of the tow chain , and made no effort to explore that night . The hotel , he saw , was an ancient structure that ranged along the heavily wooded shore of a long , narrow body of water . The place looked entirely empty ; the clerk informed him that they were closing at the end of the week . Sam retired to a creaky bed after an indifferent meal in the varnished dining room and dug into the papers in his briefcase . His disciplined mind insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his undeserved vacation . He slept soundly in the unaccustomed stillness and showed up bright and early next morning , handing his briefcase to the clerk and watching him lock it into the hotel safe . The episode of the briefcase stopped Sam for a moment in his recapitulation . It must still be in the safe . Well , thank the Lord for that ! Would it be a clue ? Doubtful , but at least it would prove to the military that he had n't run away with their secrets . That bright morning Sam pushed through the vast , lowceilinged lobby , overpopulated with shiny varnished pillars , and unsittable cane chairs . Presently he came out on a long , low verandah , with the lake sparkling in front of him . A magnificent stand of pines threw their lofty heads into the sky and a winding path covered with brown needles invited him to walk along among them . The lake itself was a deep , convincing blue , for a smart northwest wind raced down the narrow waterway , producing a galloping chop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a perfect day for a sail . Sam drew in deep lungfulls of the sweet cool air as he  | strode along . At a tiny promontory he stepped out on a rock , with the busy water slapping at his feet . There was something wonderful about life outside his professional work . rhn had known what he was talking about . " Dr. Bowden , how do you do ! " It was a cheery , powerful %nice . He turned to see its owner rapidly hobbling along the path toward him , crowfooting his way between two canes . " Silsbee , " the man introduced himself ; extending his hand , cane and all . " You 're the young fellow John Arkwright sent . " Ile dropped the cane as they shook hands and Sam stooped and picked it up , smiling boyishly . John was right ; this Silsbee was a character , and he liked him at once . It was his head that drew attention  --  bare and covered with off-blond , wavy hair  --  entirely too big for his short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life Sam noticed the color of a person 's eyes . ' These were china blue , and covered him with a direct , goodhumored stare . " Do I pass ? " Silsbee inquired , amused at Sam 's frank examination . " Yes , you pass , " Sam poked . It was an unthinkable bit of banter such as he never would have dreamed of making back at Cambridge . " Do I ? " " John says so , " Silsbee confided . " I 'll find out for myself in a minute . " " Dr. Arkwright said you were a character , and I think he was right , " Sam was inspired to continue . What had got into hint ? Silsbee laughed . " The old renegade . Yes , I 'm a character , all right . No doubt about that . What do you say to some hot breakfast ? On me ? " They moved back toward the hotel . Sam felt elated ? something he supposed he could never do outside the Laboratory . Here was a man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't give in to his infirmity . Silsbee quickly tilled him in about himself , a New Yorker who had fled to  | the woods . " I collect people , " he explained jovially . " John thought you would make a fine addition to my gallery . Here 's hoping you will . " When they were seated in the cavernous dining room a few minutes later Sam realized that Silsbee had not stopped talking once . He needed no conversational help . He impressed Sam as a nervous man , for he was always moving , often leaning forward to emphasize a point by thrusting his hand out , sometimes pointing his forefinger straight at him to poke home his idea . Once delivered of a joke  --  most of what he said was offered as humor  --  he would sit back and wrack himself with laughter , throwing his huge head in the air to get more room to breathe . Sam was charmed with him . He had n't had so much fun in years . With each outburst the canes , leaned against Silsbee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silsbee would warp his arthritic limbs around and fish for them , his blue eyes still fixed on his listener as he kept on pumping out his discourse . A waiter brought two plates covered with scrambled eggs of a loose variety , and toast and bacon . They ate them without delay . It was a hungry morning . " I wo n't apologize for the eggs , " Silsbee said , getting ready to laugh . " But I am sorry for the bacon . Y'know , I ca n't get my chef to drain the fat off . Bacon should be afloat in it , he says . Is n't that something ? " ( Burst of laughter ) . So that 's the way we have it , all summer long , complaints or no . My guests understand . They know he is a very difficult man , who would leave instantly if crossed about the bacon . They 're willing to sacrifice this much for the general good . Is n't that lovely ? " ( Uproarious laugh in which Sam joined . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fortune to get him to stay here at all , " the innkeeper was going on . " These experts come high . " Then , jabbing an index finger in Sam 's direction , " Say ! You 're an expert , too , young fellow . I want to hear all about it . " He had dropped his canes again and was torturing himself to recover them . Sam said , in a burst of unaccustomed  | warmth , " Why do n't you leave them on the floor , Mr. Silsbee ? Then you 'll only have to pick them up once . " Silsbee threw his head back and gave a laugh that rose to a joyful falsetto and merged into an echo of Sam 's remark . ' Priceless , Dr. Bowden ! Absolutely priceless ! You scientists arc real comics , too . I can see that . You know , in all these years I 've never thought of leaving them on the floor . I was wounded in the First World War , you know . Have been dropping my canes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silly Silsbee , ' that 's me ! " ( Another burst of self-applauding merriment ) . Sam could not help melting under this unbeatable optimism . Soon he was answering Silsbee 's questions about the l.ab , and volunteering a thumbnail sketch of his work in it , carefully expurgated of all confidential matters . They talked on and on after the eggs were all gone , and the bacon , too . Inevitably the subject drifted to boats . Sam asked if he could rent something with a sail . He had seen a boathouse in the pines . " You just bet you can ! I used to be a great sailer myself . But not today , my boy  --  not rent a boat , I mean . Too windy . You do n't know the lake . It 's full of hidden rocks . " " But I know water , Mr. Silsbee , " Sam argued , and they were launched into another humorous battle of words . Silsbee dominated the field with a detailed account of the summer 's drowning record . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free , loaded with good advice about not sailing . He discerned that Silsbee had a bug against boats . He just did n't approve of them . Maybe he had been torpedoed on a war transport . Anyway , Sam managed to excuse himself , saying that he was going to walk instead . Ile got into an old sweater and blue ducks and hurried off to interview Gould . The old mechanic 's place was at the throat of the lake . Keezar was ten miles long , north and south , and less than a mile wide . The Inn sprawled on the western shore near the  | upper end . Gould 's layout , as Sam came to it , boasted an ancient building bearing a bleary sign : Gould 's Garag and Gen. Store , Keezar P.O. Me . The " garag , " a dilapidated tin building , slumped beside the store , with its rear on a marsh by the lake . Sam found Harvey Gould submerged in the engine of The Nutrino . " She ai n't ready , " he piped when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her . " Sam brushed it aside good-naturedly . What he wanted was a boat . Gould came up out of the car 's innards and stared at him suspiciously . " What for ? " he said . Sam told him . The old man planted his feet , as Silsbee had done . " You 'll drownd out there . This lake ai n't no good for city folks . Better walk . " But Sam prevailed , finally . Half an hour later he was afloat and rather proud of himself . What he had under him was first cousin to a mudscow , a formless lump of rowboat built on oak frames and fastened with carriage bolts . Gould had wasted no words in praise of her , said she would sink with the first wave an inch high . But he grudgingly dragged her into the water from the marsh where she was sprawled , to the tune of five dollars for the day . By some miracle there was a short , thick mast and a piece of tarpaulin for a sail . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanic grunted disgustedly . " Calls her the Mary something , the Queen Mary , guess it is . Du n no why . I hope no real queen do n't look like that . Anyway , he give her a coat of paint before he went away . She prob'ly do n't leak much except on top . " Gould scowled after him as he bore off down the shore . He was still clutching the five dollar bill Sam had given him . " Keep to the paved road when you walk back , " he yelled , and disappeared into his " garag . " " I might have to at that , " Sam chuckled . Sailing downwind in a flat scow with no keel was the only way you could sail . Oh , hell , why not ? He 'd leave her down there and walk back , and then fetch her home when the wind shifted . Meanwhile , he was happy and amazingly carefree . Feet on the It was a bitter thought to Sam , imprisoned in the Robin , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have known he was coming down the lake . For the perfidious Icelander was there at the lower end , waiting , so full of simulated surprise and delight that Sam was completely fooled . What an idiot he had been to swallow the bait , hook and all ! Dr. Samuel S. Bowden , Director of Research , etc ! Sam withered himself with scorn . How in God 's name had he managed to be taken in ? He must examine the memory , bit by bit and find out . He had not known that morning how much Arkwright 's well-meant scolding had weakened his defenses . Miss Burton , Pearson , Kenyon , Gould , Silsbee  --  all of them in their friendly appeal had laid him wide open to this final moment of unwitting surrender . The old tub was gathering speed . " Before the wind , Queen , you 're an expert , as Silsbee would say , " Sam cried happily . With every wave his cares seemed to be washing away . He wondered idly why he had not gone to sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrons . He left the hotel a good half mile to starboard , hoping the innkeeper would n't see him . If he did , Sam would certainly catch it that night ! Oh , well , even that would be fun . As the lake lengthened behind him the wind freshened ? a typical fall blow . The Queen was generously scooping up water now , as she wallowed through one wave crest after another , and he had to bail or founder . Sam shouted aloud with exhilaration . He was back in those wonderful days as a kid , learning to manage a sailing canoe on the St. Lawrence . He went on this way till well past noon , and the end of his voyage was in sight . He had traversed the whole of Keezar Lake . He was half lying back , legs extended , when he no- gun'le , one hand on the tiller and the other clutching the sheet rope , he sailed obliviously into adventure and disaster .  | ticed a flash of silver against the shore on his left . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lying in a sheltered cove . He decided to investigate . Still at some distance he saw , in a little clearing ashore , an apparition . A huge figure in khaki shorts and a bright blue shirt came striding down to the water , shaded his eyes and stared out at him . The man had a most menacing appearance  --  a massive , bushy head surrounded by flaming red hair and a thick tangle of beard of the same hue . His gigantic , long-legged body was all of seven feet tall , Sam thought . At this distance he could not see his features , but there was something familiar about him . For the moment he was too busy with the Queen to give attention to it . " Hallo ! Hallo ! " the man bellowed . " Take care with that scow . Do n't run me down ! Put ashore on that beach down there . " Sam waved agreement and maneuvered the Queen past the plane and on to a little sand beach beyond . As he grounded the man yelled again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " Sam shouted back , a trifle irritated . He busied himself getting down the sail . " Something my boat wants . More lake to sail on . Ca n't beat back upwind . " He stepped out on the sand with his painter and looked around for something to make it fast to . The big man was clambering over the rocks in his direction . In a more reasonable voice he called , " Not many people sailing this time of year . I supposed we 'd be alone here . " " Not many aircraft to look out for on the lake , either , " Sam countered . He had found a bush and was tying his rope to it . " If I 'm trespassing , just say so and I 'll move along . " He turned and looked at the approaching giant . Yes , definitely he had seen him before . " No . You 're not trespassing " the man said , hastening a little to reach him . " I 'm doing some survey work for the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Sam got a close look at the stranger for the first time and in a flash his memory clicked . " Philip Storm ! " he cried , holding out his hand . " My God ! Where did you come from after all these years ? " The giant towered over him and a smile of delighted recognition spread over his face . " Sam Bowden ! " he held the scientist off with both hands and scrutinized his face keenly . " It is Sam Bowden , is n't it ? " " It sure is , " Sam said happily . " And you 're Phil Storm , the Norseman of the St. Lawrence . Nobody else could look like you ! " " Ah , the St. Lawrence  --  Thousand Islands . You remember ? ? " He had Sam in a bear hug and was fairly lifting him up the bank . They were both shouting at once , now , in a flood of mutual recollection . It had been ten years since they had seen each other , competing at the International Sailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a kid then , but a skillful hand already at this difficult sport , had actually become the equal of this gigantic Icelander . Storm had come to America as a champion yachtsman and stayed to make his mark in the incredible sport of racing a canoe with a towering sail and an outrigger to hold her up . It all tumbled out of Sam 's memory in a joyful rush : Storm , who had anglicized his name to Philip , the great mogul in rough water , his gargantuan body stretched far out on his outrigger board , balancing a sail no other contestant could possibly carry , making use of every ounce of wind . His flaming head a spot of orange flashing in the sun as he rounded buoy after buoy over the course . What a break to run into this old friend now and here ! Friend and teacher , too . It was Storm who had made Sam into a champion in his own right . Storm turned . " Just a moment , " he apologized , then bellowed back into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . We 'll have a bit of lunch . " Sam followed his gaze and saw a companion , dressed in corduroy pants and leather  | jacket , busy at some kind of radio apparatus set up on a small folding table . Then he felt himself propelled along the shore toward a light metal gangway that spanned the gap between plane and rocks . A moment later they were aboard and he was exclaiming over the luxury and compactness of it . Sam Bowden , the captive , opened his eyes and stared at that same interior . Storm was asleep beside him . Kara was still reading . For a moment he found it impossible to come back to reality . But the ugliness of his situation soon brought him to face his problem again . How had he mistaken this kidnapper for a friend ? That had been the crucial moment , there in his initial meeting with Storm  --  the moment when h he should have seen something , some little signal to tell him that this man was not genuine . But there was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slightest suspicion . The reason was obvious . Storm had deliberately been slow to recognize him and then had clothed the whole thing in an aura of nostalgia , of fond memories and ambitions lived again , and this had completely blanketed his good sense . Even so , why had n't the amazing coincidence of their meeting impressed him at the time and made him wary ? It was almost absurd , that coincidence . And , as he looked back on it now , the sinister interpretation of the meeting was much easier to credit than the innocent one . Storm would almost have had to plan the meeting to make it come off so perfectly . Sam sighed . Under the influence of his passion for sailing , he had taken leave of his judgment , his caution , his duty , even . He was shocked at what he had done . It was all right to blame Arkwright , and certainly John had some blame coming to him , for urging him to forget everything and just have fun . It did not occur to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged all this , as a member of the conspiracy . As the chronicler of this story , I do n't know . No one will ever know . This is not unique today . Many  | the usands of traitors exist among us ; they must . No country cmild have succumbed so thoroughly to enemy pressure without them . But most of them will never be known . But this problem did not occupy Sam at all . He did think bi icily about the fact that there must have been an informer iii the Lab who let Storm know when Sam would be at the Like . The identity of this criminal , however , did not worry lulu now . There were worse things to worry about . He knew that he had made many errors in that period of sunny enjoyment with the Storms . He had had a dozen chances to catch on and to extricate himself , after their first meeting at the lake . He had bungled every one !  | IN HIS painstaking search Sam doggedly recalled every detail of that fateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man Charles had served from the Robin 's tiny galley , the drinks of best quality before it , the memories of the happy times back on the St. Lawrence . He had scarcely noticed Charles at first , beyond observing that he was thick and blond and obviously Slavic . The man had served them with impeccable restraint , correct even to the brief steward 's jacket . Yet , Sam saw now , he was no flunky . He might even be the leading mind in this infamous plot . Sam recalled something else : the fact that once he had learned the difficult art of sailing a canoe he had beaten his flamboyant instructor almost every time . Storm had not liked that too well . Was it possible that he had harbored a grudge all this time , and now that he had joined the enemy , had made up his mind to a side trip into personal revenge ?  | II so , he had not let it interfere with their joyous reunion that day nor with the splendid vacation that followed . The name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town from which the races were run . " All ! Remember that last one ? " Storm had picked up the narrative . " I 'd put an extra six inches on my outrigger track , just on the chance that I could perch out there if the wind held si long enough , full eight feet from her gun'le . Rigged sheet and tiller ropes through extra blocks to get them in hand . And how she blew ! How I traveled ! " He rubbed his great hands , his face crinkling fantastically in a broad grin . Then he added with a shrug , " And yet , when I crossed the finish line there you were waiting for me ! " " It was your race , really , " Sam protested generously . " You taught me everything I knew . " He grinned up at the big Icelander , for whom his old affection had seemed renewed . " Boy ! " he had cried ingenuously , " wish I could get time for just one day in a sailer again ! " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a key craftily fashioned for him by his instructor turned enemy . " You can ! " Storm had said softly . " I 've been thinking that we ought to race once more . Maybe I could beat you now ! " He put his hand on Sam 's shoulder persuasively . " See here . You have this whole week here at Keezar , you said . Why not fly up to my summer place instead and make your vacation pay off ? I have canoes , all the rigs , a lake as big as this one . Everything . How does it sound ? " Alas ! How readily , Sam realized , he had fallen for it ! Storm had clinched the matter immediately , smoothly . " I 'll have Charles row your boat back up the lake at once . We can enjoy ourselves here until he returns . " And then had come the most painful lost opportunity of all . Sam had said he would row back with Charles , pick up his car at Gould 's and go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and himself back to the plane . He had noticed Storm give the other a brief glance of warning .  | But Charles had spoken up so quickly that he had not been aware of the significance of the signal . " May I suggest , Mr. Storm , " he had put in quietly , " that if Dr. Bowden sees Mr. Silsbee at the Inn he refrain from mentioning your name ? " Storm had taken his cue instantly . " Yes , Sam , it would save you much annoyance with Silsbee if you left me out . He is sure to advise you against going with me . He 's hated me ever since I stole the show at one of his regattas here a few summers ago . " He had paused , then casually added , " Better still , do n't mention you are going at all . Just leave word you have struck off into the woods with a friend . " As Sam considered that key moment now , he had to admire the consummate way the two conspirators had played it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a word or glance , did they try to prevent his going back to the hotel for his bag . Yet it must have seemed to them that the game might easily be lost . It was by this kind of daring move that the conspiracy had made its most brilliant advances . He was in no doubt now that it was the conspiracy that had seized him . Sam had fumbled the next gambit also . With friendly concern he had offered to put the two men up at the Inn that night , so that they could get a fair start in the morning . The tall Icelander had ruefully declined . " You know , my boy , hotel beds are nightmares to me . You can see why . " No ; Sam admitted that he had flunked every opportunity . That TV fellow 's appraisal had been right : " the scientist 's mind , its enormous discipline and concentration , its extraordinary exclusion of all common human understanding . " Charles put on his leather jacket again and a boating cap and soon he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The wind had died down a little but still kicked up a good deal of resistance . Charles pulled rhythmically at the oars , making no criticism of the lumbering hulk he had to row . Sam was intrigued by this silent , rather truculent fel- low , and decided to leave him alone , since he obviously wished to be considered a servant . This did not last long , however . In a brief burst of good nature Charles observed that it would have been quicker to tow the Queen back up the lake behind the plane , taxiing . Soon it appeared that Charles was Storm 's pilot as well as his butler ; more , he was a former ace in the Polish National Air Force of war days , and had a distinguished record against the Germans . What he had done after Stalin had been presented with Poland by Franklin Roosevelt , Charles did not say . At one point Sam offered to spell him at the oars but the man declined . " I am much stronger than you , Dr. Bowden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sam studied his memories of the next few hours with utmost care . If he had left a trail anywhere it was there in Keezar village that afternoon . It would take scrutiny to find anything . So far as his present desperate situation was concerned , it had been a comedy of errors . For one thing , by the time Charles had finally rowed him ashore at Gould 's it had fallen dark . The Pole had hopped out onto the marsh and had quickly suggested that Sam go and get his car ; he would fix the boat and follow . Sam was glad to do so , thinking Charles was the perfect servitor indeed . The Nutrino , he was relieved to see , stood outside the garage and was ready . Sam had gone into Gould 's little office to find him and they had chatted a few minutes , then Sam had paid his bill and left . Charles was waiting for him in the car . They drove off around the lake head to the Inn without delay . Wait ! You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his memory and backtracked a little . Had Gould come to the door as they departed ? Could the old man have seen Charles in the car ? Try as he would he could not visualize that moment  --  the lighted door of the garage and whether Gould 's figure stood in it or not . His mind , full of the coming pleasures , had betrayed him .  | Sam berated himself bitterly again now . How could he have been so unobservant ? What kind of a detective would he ever make ? He had to be one from now on or lose his freedom for sure . Had Gould come to the door ? And had Charles looked toward him so as to show his face ? He just plain did n't know . Exasperating gaps in memory plague us all and are perfectly normal . But Sam was in no mood to forgive himself for them now . His rescue might hinge on Gould 's observation of Charles , if he had made one . Gould , he realized , was like a photographic plate . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being recorded and analyzed . It was tantalizing not to know whether this tremendous little clue had been left behind or had not been . " Damn ! " growled Sam . " And you call yourself a scientist ! " He pulled The Nutrino up to the hotel and leaped out , telling Charles he would run in and get his bag . Charles merely bowed acquiescence and sat placidly waiting . Sam went in , thinking he was sure to find Silsbee and that he would tell him he was taking a few days away with a friend who had miraculously turned up . But Silsbee was nowhere to be seen . Nor was the clerk . There were no guests in sight ; probably the last of them had gone . The lobby was lighted but empty . Sam repacked one of his bags with his roughest things and came back downstairs , still looking for somebody to leave word with . It seemed the only decent thing to do with Silsbee . There was a whack-bell on the desk and he struck it . The note jarred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then a swinging door slammed open in the adjacent dining room and a tall , villainous looking Italian in a soiled chef 's cap barged in . " What you want ? " He was obviously not in a good mood . Sam told him , and asked him to explain to the innkeeper . " Silsbee gone for Portland . Back late . I tell him tomorr ' . " He did n't look very reliable , so Sam picked up a folder on the  | desk and wrote a short note to Silsbee on the back of it , handing it to the chef . " Will you be sure to give it to him ? " he asked . The Italian took the folder and wadded it up and stuffed it in his back pocket . " You 'll be sure ? " " Sure sure ! W'at you t'ink ? I tell him . " The man stood scowling at him a minute , then turned and stalked away . Sam hesitated , decided it was the best he could do , and picked up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just that he did n't want to let Silsbee down . He returned to the car and in twenty minutes they were down the lake again in the clearing . Storm greeted him jovially as he stepped aboard the Robin . " Something to eat , now , Charles , " he said over his shoulder , and the man disappeared promptly into the galley that was neatly tucked in just aft of the pilot 's compartment . Again the meal was a delight . This man Charles certainly had many talents . It was pitch dark when they had finished . " Now then , " Storm said . " I 'm going to surprise you . We 'll fly north tonight , so we wo n't waste any of your precious sailing time tomorrow . " " Tonight ? Can you ? I thought you 'd probably have to wait till daylight . The big Icelander made little of it . " Nothing to it . Charles was a fighter pilot during the war  --  perhaps he told you ? and we 've been working up in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sleep . My place , by the way , is up back of Moosehead Lake . I have a private lake of my own , about 125 miles from here . We should be there in an hour . It wo n't make you uneasy , flying at night , will it ? " " Oh , no . " Sam was ready for anything . " What about The Nutrino , though ? That 's what I call my little car . Should n't I run it back to Gould 's and let you pick me up there ? " Storm roared . " Nutrino ' ! That 's perfect ! The smallest atomic particle . You physicists always pick up droll names  | like that . No , there 's no need of taking it back to the garage . I 'll have Charles run it a little deeper into the clearing for you . It 'll be perfectly safe here for a few days  --  easier to get at when I bring you back . " He turned to his man , who was just finishing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The keys are in it , " Sam told Charles . " And will you bring them and the bag when you come back ? " The Pole bowed slightly and went ashore . He was gone for some time , during which Storm kept his guest busy by showing him the Robin . They went aft . The cabin was remarkably roomy . In addition to several pairs of seats along the port side and a long settee on the other , there was one stateroom and , farther back a lavatory and small lounge . The latter was fitted out as a kind of workroom , with a bench and a selection of tools . The equipment on the bench instantly caught Sam 's eye . It was the radio gear he had noticed earlier ashore . Storm , behind him , said proudly , " Makes you think of your own laboratory , eh , Sam ? No doubt you 're familiar with everything here . " And he reeled off the identifying numbers , FN6D , AN/ARC-4 , and so . Sam was delighted . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in government communications . " We 'll go into all this presently , " his host said . " I think Charles is about ready to go . " The pilot had come back aboard with Sam 's bag and car keys and was busy in the cockpit starting the two magnificent Hornets with which the Robin was powered . By the time they had steadied down into a robust idling cough , Storm had cast off the nylon lines that ran ashore and stowed the gangplank , fitting it into its niche in the cabin wall . Sam admired his vigorous efficiency as he dogged down the entrance door . " Smart little ship , " he complimented . " This trip is one I 'm going to enjoy . " He slid into a seat and buckled his belt . His host did the same .  | Charles taxied out into the lake and then , without delay , revved up and threw the amphibian into the wind . They slammed and banged over the waves for a minute and then all the roughness ceased . They were airborne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course Storm invited him to have a look at his equipment again . For the next half hour Sam was treated to a wonderful variety of technical surprises , cleverly miniaturized and fitted into the small space of the " lab " at the rear of the cabin . With most of it he was very familiar : Geiger counters , scintillometers , magnetic survey instruments of various sorts . The radio , as he examined it more closely , puzzled him . It was surprisingly elaborate . He said as much to Storm . The big Icelander chuckled . " I never know what I may be up against next , " he confided . " I 'm a mineralogist , as I guess you 've heard . " Sam nodded . Storm 's name was a familiar one in this branch of science . " I can communicate with Washington , of course , and out of the country when I need to . " Exploration  --  that 's where I come in with the government . Strategic metals , mostly . Under us right now , if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A richer country than most people realize . The quartz and feldspar have been worked for a century . Beryl and mica were the big things during the last war . Now we 're looking into the lithium and cesium ores . They could be valuable some day in the space effort . Then there 's columbium and tin , both vital in steel . There 's a chance the United States might be pretty well fixed in another war . We do n't know the full extent of it yet . That 's what I 'm slowly finding out . " The appalling significance of Storm 's knowledge of Maine 's mineral resources suddenly struck Sam , as he remembered this conversation . An enemy agent actually at work mapping and codifying our defense materials , and no one the wiser ! He wondered if anyone in Washington was really the wiser . Probably .  | Storm had switched power onto a small transmitter on the radio bench and picked up a hand mike . " NAN-5 , NAN5 , T5HQZ calling NAN-5 . " He repeated the call several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened with interest as his host gave a brusque message as to his course and destination and ended with the conventional " Over and out . " This was the practical end of the game , so close to his own in the Lab , yet so far removed . " Routine report , " Storm explained . " They like to keep track of me , you know . Up here in the defense radar cover they watch everything that flies . Even the birds have to check in , it seems . " He grinned boyishly . Even now , far along on his path toward captivity , Sam was staggered with the smoothness of that first hour of the kidnaping . Storm and Charles had played every second of it with consummate skill . Not a detail missing or out of place . Undoubtedly there was a part of Storm that was genuine . He did have the plane ; he had checked by short wave with the Bureau of Mines  --  Sam happened to recognize the call letters . He shivered , glancing quickly at Storm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of traitor do we have in the government ? They were still engrossed with the equipment when Charles flashed a red cabin light . It was time to fasten the belts again . They were on their way down . Sam could not see from his window whether there were landing lights on the lake or not , but assumed there must be some . Lights or not , a moment later he felt the slam of the hull against water and the bumping deceleration . Charles had landed perfectly . The Icelander chatted pleasantly as they taxied in . The lake was about half a mile wide and four long , he explained ; plenty of sea room for the fastest canoe . Sam could see that  | he , too , was impatient to stretch out on an outrigger again , even in mid-October in Maine . It was going to be chilly , but wonderfully invigorating . The place was called Tomhagen Pond on the map , his host said . It was quite deep , had no hidden rocks offshore . " Our hideout is on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't find us . But you will be comfortable . Mrs. Storm will be at the dock to meet us , I think . " Sam could see that they were coming in toward it now . In the beam of a searchlight Charles was using he caught a glimpse of a boathouse with an enormous mouth . A moment later the pilot swung round and nosed the amphibian directly into it and killed the engines . The wideswept arch of the roof received the entire plane , wings and all . The Robin glided to a stop in a slip that fitted snugly around her hull . It was only a step to a float alongside . A man in a heavy sweater was making her fast . Charles came aft at once and undogged the cabin door , throwing it wide open . Storm was ready at the opening and leaped to the float . Still at his window , Sam saw the tall figure of a woman in the shadows beyond . She came forward slowly , as if making an entrance . For a brief moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had he expected ? A rosychecked outdoor-girl type to match Phil Storm , the sportsman ? This was not the apparition that confronted him as he reached the door . She was on the float by then and had seen him . " Philip , darling , " she cried . " So good to have you back . And who is that nice young man with you ? " Sam 's ingrained fear of women reached panic proportions as he heard his host say , " Sam , this is Kara , my wife . Kara , Dr. Samuel S. Bowden of the Reading Laboratory . You got my message ? " She nodded and extended beautifully manicured fingers to Sam . " Dr. Bowden , welcome to Tomhagen Pond ! " Sam felt an impulse to bend in a bow , but restrained himself . " It 's fine to be here , " was all he managed , taking her  | hand . For a moment they stood , looking straight into each other 's eyes . She was a Valkyrie , poised , magnificent , the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an intriguing design . Her head was bare and her dark brown hair was smoothly pulled to the back . She had learned the valuable trick of looking a person straight in the eyes until those eyes fell . Kara Storm 's eyes , revealed there in the brightly lighted boathouse , were a pale violet , intense , incredible . His were the first to fall . She gave a little laugh and turned , taking Philip 's arm and leading the way outdoors . The scene , as he relived it now , was etched indelibly on his brain . Should he have known that this was no Washington society matron but a plotter direct from the House of Borgia ? No ; he did not think that even John Arkwright would have scolded him for misinterpreting her . And surely , in his habitual ivory tower , he could not be expected to know that however corny this type might seem in a cloak-and-dagger mystery , here in real life the Communists would necessarily resort to it . We Americans would be impressed by nothing else , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , captive as we are to television . And who should know this better than our enemies ?  | HE HAD never seen anyone like her in his narrow world . From the top of her sleek head to her remarkably small feet ( red toenails in sandals in October ! ) she was a new phenomenon to him . He thought of Miss Burton and wished that he had her by him to tell him what to do  --  as if she herself would have known ! The Storms led him up a winding path to what Philip humorously announced as " The Camp . " The grounds were ablaze with lights . Nestled comfortably among a stand of pines and spruce , the building reminded Sam of the luxurious hunting lodges he had heard that New York financiers maintained in the Adirondacks . It was long and rangy , with a studied roughness of exterior , and sat in grounds beautifully kept in their casualness . This was , he supposed , an expression of Kara 's personality . He felt that Storm himself would not have bothered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rafted living room , straight out of an architectural magazine . There were wicker lounging chairs everywhere , expensive rugs , cushions strewn about the floor in Oriental fashion . A massive fireplace of imported pink limestone blocks was topped by a huge monolith of some smooth dark rock , into the face of which a single ceramic tile had been cemented , blazoned with a coat of arms of yellow and blue . There was an ineffable sense of expensive repose here . These were aristocrats of the Old World , the room insisted , who fled occasionally to the Maine wilderness to rest from their exploits . Charles remained by the door obediently , holding Sam 's bag . There seemed no doubt that , as far as Mrs. Storm was concerned , he was a menial . " You would like to freshen up , I think , Dr. Bowden , " she told Sam crisply , and led the way to a bedroom at the end of a long paneled hall . It was an apartment as sumptuous as the rest of the house , complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bag and followed his mistress out . Sam wondered , as he opened the bag , if he had brought the wrong clothes from the Inn . He had had no idea that he was in for a social week . He changed into the best he had ? a pair of reasonably well-pressed slacks and a clean shirt , and sallied forth . On his return to the living room he realized that he need not have been so careful . Storm had donned an enormous pair of dirty green cotton pants and a turtle-neck sweater . Kara , still immaculate , stood out in sharp contrast to him . Sam felt an invisible barrier between the two . To his surprise , Charles joined them , correct and military in his handsome pilot 's uniform . He was not a servant then , after all . As they stood chatting for a moment before the crackling fire , two Siamese cats marched solemnly into the room . They came with the air of a royal guard , the larger and plainer slightly behind the other . Sam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in admiration . This was , in- deed , a day of surprises . The cats ignored him and came to a halt before their mistress , sat and stared up at her unblinkingly . " Darlings ! " she cried . " Thank you . " She turned to Sam . " The kittens are announcing dinner , " she explained . The cats reversed themselves and proceeded slowly toward the dining room . She stood looking at the scientist expectantly . Just barely remembering what to do , he offered his arm and they followed the cats in . At the entrance Kara disengaged her hand and clapped sharply . " Nikita ! Fey ! Off to your reward ! " The two animals , still in perfect formation , made an oblique turn and marched away without a backward glance . It was an exhibition as unexplainable to him as she was herself . " Do n't you think they are well trained , Dr. Bowden ? " she smiled , and he realized that the whole thing had been an expression of her own superior personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Many intelligent creatures can be conditioned to execute orders , " she went on . " Even to the death , if one has the power to command them " A remark , he thought afterward , oddly suggestive of what was to come . The dinner , competently served by a stolid foreign woman who was wordless , went off smoothly and Sam , as much as possible , let the others do the talking . Storm and Charles did most of it , recounting the details of their meeting at Keezar Lake . By the end of the meal , which he did n't really want , Sam had begun to entertain a disquieting thought . Mrs. Storm must have known that he was going to be there ! But he carefully said nothing of this , thinking that he must have misinterpreted them . He was glad when dinner was over and he was permitted to turn in . " We 'll want to get an early start on the lake , " his host explained . And his hostess bid him a cordial good night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on end they sailed , he and Storm . The wind held in the north- west and the Viking outdistanced him on every pass , beating him in every race unmercifully . The more the Icelander won the more assertive and boisterous he became , until Sam could not help seeing that this was his special , if good-natured , revenge for those old defeats . But he loved it all , every minute of it , and was content to chalk up a pallid victory now and then when the wind dropped so that Storm could not make use of his prodigious length on the outrigger board . There was little of gentle breezes that week , however , and he was tested to the utmost of his skill , rusty now after many years disuse . Fast , brilliant sailing in these special decked canoes , Sam realized only too well , must be done with every stay straining , the lee gunwale buried and the master of the tiny craft perched as far to windward on his outrigger as he could manage , to balance the wind pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hair-raising beats into the teeth of the gale be successfully accomplished . A tiny error of judgment , a mistake in gauging the sudden flaws that occurred continually , and you were hoisted into the air by the outrigger and catapulted into the drink . It happened to him more than once . Yet , win or lose , wet or dry , Sam enjoyed it all and took his licking in good part . So thoroughly did they concentrate on their game that they hardly saw Kara at all , except in the brief after-dinner evenings , when both men were exhausted and wanted only to drop into bed . And in this way Storm gave Sam what he had promised  --  one of the finest vacations he had ever had . Friday evening came . Tanned and feeling washed clean of cobwebs , Sam had stretched himself out in the great living room , comfortably stiff and languorous . " I wish I had time for more of it , " he said . " But tomorrow is Saturday and I have to go back . I hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must . " " Charles will have the plane ready in the morning , " Storm replied . " I 'm glad we had the chance to give you this much . " " I sure slipped back to amateur status , " Sam confessed ruefully . " You 're miles ahead of me now . "  | Kara chimed in . " You need n't be so modest , Dr. Bowden ? Sam . I shall call you Sam , why not ? Even if you are a very important man . " " And a damn good canoe sailer , " Philip added . " I try to do my job down there , " Sam defended himself . " I 'll be able to do it better because of this week . I 'm really grateful for it . " " Very gallant , " Kara murmured , watching him with her violet eyes . Sam excused himself and went off to pack . Half an hour later he stepped out onto the pine-bordered terrace . A waning harvest moon was tardily rising over the trees to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sky was streaked with pale streamers of cloud . The wind had dropped entirely . The sweet scent of burning leaves hung delicately over the glassy lake , which undulated just enough to make the reflection of the moon seem to grin lopsidedly . He walked slowly along the path , close to the water . As he moved over the soft pine carpet a dull monotone of sound came up out of the night ahead , growing more distinct as he progressed . Presently he was abreast of a small building standing back among the trees . He studied it a moment and decided it held an electric pump , attending to the water supply . A second shack , beyond the first , caught his eye , but he thought nothing of it . He sat down on a rock and threw a stick at the moon 's image , which broke into a thousand little gold flakes that scattered and then gradually reassembled again . He picked up another stick , just as the pump noise stopped " It 's lovely here at night , is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet . Kara was standing close behind him . " When you did n't come back I knew you must have gone outside . " He apologized for being impolite . Her nearness was poignant and a little disturbing . The scent she was wearing en- veloped him . It seemed to blend with the piney smell of the forest , yet depart from it . She belonged here , he thought , in the majesty of nature . For some reason the plain , honest face of Miss Burton rose before him , in contrast . Kara moved up beside him and took his hand . In the silence he thought he caught the sound of words , coming from one of the shacks  --  a mumble like a telephone conversation stripped of its identifying clearness . She moved still closer to him . " That is Alfredo , our Italian gardener . He lives there . But do n't let 's bother with him now . " " It does n't sound like Italian , " he objected . She said lightly , " Oh , he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you call them  --  hams ? He talks with the most outlandish people . For all I know we may be hearing an Esquimo in Alaska . " Then she was suddenly against him . " Kiss me , Sam ! " He stared at her dumbfounded , forgetting all about the radio voices . Not knowing how to avoid it , he took her in his arms and it must be admitted , he found it very pleasant indeed . " You 're a sweet boy , " she murmured after a moment , drawing back . Then she disengaged herself entirely and pulled him along the path by the hand . " Let 's go back and have a drink . " She hummed a little tune as they strolled , and this exasperated him . They were beyond hearing the Italian gardener , now . She stopped on the path , facing him . " Do you really think I am going to let you make love to me with Philip watching ? " she asked softly . " Good heavens ! Of course not ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An honorable man . A really honorable man ! " she smiled , and patted his cheek . " Some day perhaps you may , " she said quickly , and kissed him again and fled toward the house . Philip was standing in front of the fire when they came in . " According to the radio it 's going to rain , " he reported . " Easterly coming . We may have trouble getting off tomorrow . " Sam scarcely heard him . He was numb from his recent encounter .  | But it was a different Kara who greeted him at breakfast next morning : cool , poised , mistress of her household and wife of her illustrious husband . Sam was relieved . He had been through a good deal in that past week , and this was something that held too many risks altogether . He was making a providential escape . Then he glanced out of a window and noticed the weather . It was blowing a gale and rain slashed almost horizontally outside . This was the Saturday morning of his departure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about getting you back , " Storm told him as Sam sat down . " Here 's a cup of coffee . Warm you up . Trouble is , I 'm not sure we can get the plane off in this strong cross wind . That 's the one drawback about this place  --  the lake is unprotected from the east . " Sam considered the problem . " Not wide enough to make the take-off run crossways ? " Storm shook his head . A short time later they went out to the porch . No mistake . It was a gale , all right . Sam took one look at the lake , with its angry waves , and agreed that the Robin could never get herself into the sky this morning . " Tough luck , " the Icelander was saying , but he did n't sound too disturbed . " Is it really important for you to get back to Reading tomorrow ? It will only be Sunday . " Sam did not answer directly . " Is it possible you could drive me to a train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane is our only transportation , except on foot . " The scientist considered the matter . It was really not vital to be back on Sunday . He wanted to do it mostly because he had set that deadline originally . " Well , let 's wait and see , " he said . " But I must positively get out of here somehow tomorrow morning , storm or no . " As the day wore on the gale increased . Angry dark brown waves lashed the shore in front of the house . Philip seemed more and more apologetic as the storm showed no signs of abating . Sam was not in a good mood , either . " If you could row me across that small estuary behind the house , " he pro- posed , " I could hike through the woods to the nearest town and hire a car ? " " Twenty-five miles . You 'd never make it . I do n't know the way , even . Neither does Charles . " The Icelander shrugged and smiled helplessly . " Well , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A gloomy dusk , descending in mid-afternoon , drove Sam 's spirits to a new low . He had never before been late at the Laboratory , or told Miss Burton to come in on Sunday and then fail to do so himself . He fiddled with his keys in his bedroom and dropped them under the dresser and forgot them . He went to bed with a feeling of foreboding , but it was not Kara that made him uneasy . It was something he could n't name . He thought of the keys again as he fell asleep , but they slipped his mind in the rush of getting started the next morning . Later he was to realize how lucky his forgetfulness had been . Presumably they still lay under the dresser , a positive proof that he had been there  --  that is , if anyone found them who was a member of the searchers ' team . Sunday morning the blow had moderated enough to let the plane get off . Sam came in to breakfast in fine vigor . " I guess we can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm sorry to be so jumpy about this . I know you could n't help the wind . " Both Storm and Kara made a great ceremony of his departure , and came with him to the boathouse , Storm carrying his bag . The plane lay there as they had left it several days before and seemed eager to go . But Charles was not in his pilots 's uniform but in a dirty white mechanic 's coverall . He greeted them with an ill-natured grunt . " Charles , is anything wrong ? " Storm demanded . The man shrugged . " Starboard engine wo n't start . I 'm looking into it to see what is the matter . " " That 's wise , " his employer told him . " I 'm sure you 'll find  | it is nothing serious . " He turned to Sam . " We 'll wait inside the plane , shall we ? " But after twenty minutes Sam got restless and climbed out to see what Charles was doing . To his surprise , the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ float . He was methodically taking it apart . " For God 's sake ? " the scientist began , thoroughly irritated . From a difficult posture up under the engine Charles growled a reply . " You do n't want me to take you up and kill you , do you , Dr. Bowden ? " " No , but ? Hell , man , you had all day yesterday to make tests and find any trouble there was . Why ? ? " " I 'll find the trouble all right , " was all that Charles would add . Sam raged for a moment but got no more attention , so he switched to the Storms . They were lavish in their apologies . Kara said sweetly , " We 'll try to make you comfortable , Sam . It wo n't take long to make the repairs . Charles is a brilliant mechanic . " It ended up by Sam 's insisting on remaining in the boathouse , watching everything Charles did . He had to admit that the Pole knew what he was doing and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on he realized that Charles was his only hope . The Storms had gone back to the house ; they seemed to have given him up . The hours dragged on . Sam refused to come in to lunch and Philip brought him some sandwiches and coffee in the boathouse . Sam felt a little better . Charles had cheered up as he had got deeper into the engine and had been explaining just what was the matter and what he was doing to fix it . It was an extraordinary coincidence , but the gale and then the engine failure were equally genuine . During the morning Sam 's sense of foreboding had expanded itself into a vague suspicion that something more serious than the engine was  | not right . Now , Charles set his fears at rest , by making his explanations of the mechanical fault perfectly clear , and even by letting Sam assist him at times in the overhaul . The defect had turned out to be in one of the magnetoes  --  a broken contact assembly that took only a few minutes to replace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the reassembly was finished at last it was well past two o'clock and Charles insisted on going out onto the lake to test the engine thoroughly . He did not come back for an hour ; there appeared to be some roughness in the engine that he had trouble getting out . When he did finally come in he was satisfied . " It is all well now , " he said with his faint accent . " Sorry it took so long , Dr. Bowden . But you can not go aloft unless everything is  --  just so . Correct ? " The man hurried off to change his clothes and Sam went back to the house to inform the Storms of departure . As he and Storm returned to the plane , Kara caught up to them , carrying a wicker basket . " If you two men do n't mind , " she said , " the kittens and I will go along for the ride . " Her husband grunted and Sam groaned inwardly . It seemed as if this woman put a jinx on him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wondered  --  especially as it was going to be dark most of the way ? But he pushed down his annoyance and murmured a word of approval that she was going along . Why she wanted the cats with her , he could n't imagine , and did n't ask . What would happen , indeed ! The whole incredible story was there before him , as he sat huddled in the Robin , being whisked away  --  where ? Why ? He recalled every detail he could and where did it get him ? Nowhere . The whole thing bristled with questions , with hopeless enigmas . Somehow Storm had found out he was to be at Keezar that week and had come down to get him , faking a chance meeting . It was a fine job . These two scoundrels were consummate actors .  | here was , of couse , a lot more to it than rigging up a chance ecting at a remote resort . The plot had to reach back to ' 1 ' 1 and the Lab . He shuddered ; he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind and decide which one had formed on him . ' I he thing that bothered him now was these last few days of racing , and that disquieting moment when Kara had inlied his advances at the shore of the Pond . Whatever their motivation , these people were not amateurs . But why the kid gloves ? If they wanted him why did n't they simply send to ound a gang of thugs and take him ? Almost at once he saw the answer . He was too prominent a figure for conventional kidnaping . But even that did not explain the " red carpet " treatment he had received , and was , in fact , still receiving . ' I'lie explanation would have to lie in their ultimate objective . Why had they taken him ? There was evidently an attempt to reduce his resentment and lay the groundwork for his c ooperation . It was no friendship , no liking for him personally that made them do this . There was something beyond this that must be the real motivation . He thought he saw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American will and its subjugation to the will of the enemy  --  permanently . It had been so diabolically clever , this skillful eroding of the independence of Americans over the past few years . The Storms , he was sure , played only a small part , but they fitted the pattern perfectly : suave , immensely competent traitors , blandly working their way to the innermost confidences of the nation . Trusting , somewhat frightened , victims were everywhere  --  incapable of believing anything bad or behaving in any way but generously toward the enemy . The softening process , going on in every city and hamlet and countryside of America , gradually spreading , involving more and more intelligent people , until soon it would be too late for anybody to resist . The government , little by little given over  | to smooth traitors like Storm , piously presiding over the total corruption of a nation . " Dear God , " he prayed silently . " Let me be rescued so that I can help to alert my country before it is too late ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or of his country !  --  5 . Sunday , October 16 STORM HAD been up front with the pilot for some time when Sam again took cognizance of the cabin interior . As he did so the big red head appeared , bowed to clear the low ceiling of the cockpit alley . The Icelander stopped at the galley and poured himself a mug of coffee from a thermos bottle held in a rack . He came aft , gulping it . " Help yourself to Java if you want it , " he tossed at Sam , motioning toward the galley with his mug . Something snapped in Sam . He rose . " My good friend , Phil Storm , " he grated . " Help yourself to Java ! ' Quite a change from all the hospitality of the past few days , is n't it ? Now it 's ' If you want something go get it . ' " Storm shrugged without much interest and walked off toward the rear . " Keep your temper , Sam dear , " Kara advised . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning on her furiously ,  | " that I wo n't take this lying down . " He stared at her and saw the little smile at the corners of her mouth . " Oh , hell , what 's the use ! " " No use , " said Kara complacently . " The performance is over . We were pretty good , do n't you think ? " He flung himself back in his seat . Kara turned and regarded him thoughtfully , not repeating her question . But she said , " Do you have a watch , Sam ? " " Of course I have a watch . If you want to know the time ? " " No , I do n't want to know the time . Please give me the watch . " He was taken aback for a moment , then caught on . " Suppose I do n't choose to give it to you ? I 'll tell you one thing : it 's pretty late for people like you to try this nonsense . It wo n't work . " Kara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Getting angry and threatening wo n't do you any good at all . Now , let me have it , please . " Savagely he pulled it off his wrist and handed it to her . " There 's a radio broadcasting set in it , you know , " he jabbed . " It goes to work automatically when it is stolen . " " I 'm sure it does . " He saw that she was treating him like a naughty child . He pulled himself out of the seat and went aft to the lavatory . When he came out he said nastily to Storm , " Clever trick , swiping my watch so I ca n't estimate how far we fly before landing . " Philip smiled indulgently . " Better we have it , Sam . Although , if Charles should happen not to fly a straight course , you would n't get much idea of actual distance by timing the flight . It 's just a precaution that 's standard in these situa-tions ? " " Standard ? " He thought for a moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file a flight plan for this trip ? That 's standard , too . " " We do n't have to , " Storm replied comfortably . " They always know the general region we 're working in . That they  | insist upon . I file once a week or so . The Department is very ( ' cent about it . " " ' They know you 're kidnaping people , I suppose , and do n't want to seem to interfere . " Storm smiled broadly . " Perhaps they do , at that . At least , n  --  e of them in the Department do . Our contacts in other departments are very cooperative , too . State , particularly . Interesting things go on in government communications , you know , Sam . " It was on the tip of Sam 's tongue to bring up the car keys it this moment , just to cause his captor some worry . But he ught himself in time . This was a secret worth keeping . It ight be valuable later . He turned to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Somebody tracks you to your stination on radar , of course . Like everybody else in the sky . You 're taking quite a chance , fooling with the defense network that way . " " Maybe . But I would n't count on help from that quarter , Sam . The point is , they trust us . Absolutely . They have n't the smallest reason to suspect that we would be doing what we are doing . By the time they find it out you will be 5000 miles away . " Sam eyed him with loathing and went back to his seat . The arrogance of the whole thing was beyond belief . He pulled his blanket up over his head to shut out as much of the environment as he could , and sat there with his dark thoughts . Here they were , this same enemy , at Reading and thousands of other labs and factories , no doubt businesses and professional posts as well , working day and night , termites in the government and out , accepted and trusted ? and , beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually advancing miasma of national death . Sam slipped into a vague nightmare of bristling red apparitions with soft voices and fists full of little airplanes , chasing him in sailing canoes with an army of Karas applauding . Drifting between sleep and consciousness , he judged that  | it was a couple of hours later that a slight deafness told him the plane was losing altitude . He managed to put his head against the window , still under the blanket . There was nothing to see  --  nothing at all . It was pitch black and no stars showed . Ten minutes later he knew that the moment for action had come . Charles had cut back the engines and they were in a glide path with the wing flaps down . Sam 's practiced ears noted the heavy grunt of the landing gear motors as the Robin 's auxiliary wheels swung down below the hull . He looked out again . Still nothing . Not a light , not a beacon , no string of runway lights , no lights in houses or on streets . They must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It must be a very small field , Sam figured . All the better for his chances to make good his escape . The thing now was to be on the keen edge of readiness , to get the utmost out of whatever situation developed . He threw off his blanket and ostentatiously fastened his seat belt as he felt the Robin hit the bumpy air near the ground . The plane pitched and sideslipped considerably , but Charles was equal to it . Soon there was a gentle shock as the wheels hit what appeared to be a good modem runway . The cabin tilted back steeply , as is its wont in small private planes on the ground . Sam sat perfectly still , waiting , trying to make his face a blank , as if to say , " O.K. , I 'm licked . I wo n't try anything . " He was not dumb . He was learning the new game fast . Charles killed the engines and as always in a plane gone dead , the little sounds of the interior struck the ear with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would be necessary to do it by subterfuge , by superior acting . A thin chance indeed ! Storm was standing aft and undogged the door . Kara had joined him and they stood together , blocking the exit . Her husband broke out the gangplank , which was cleverly arranged with steps on its reverse side . He dropped them down  | to the dark and attached them to the sill of the door . Then e did an amazing thing . " You go on ahead , " he said to Kara , uite casually . " I want to check the radio here with Charles . I 'll be along presently . " With that he strode forward and disappeared into the forward compartment . Sam moved down the aisle , wondering if there were any possible way he could knock the woman out with a sudden , unexpected blow . But she evidently was prepared for that . " Would you like to help me down ? " she invited him . His impulse was to tell her that he would gladly kick her out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word he climbed down the steps and stood , holding up his hand to take hers . Then the second miracle happened . " Wait a minute , " Kara cried . " I forgot the kittens . " And she disappeared back into the cabin . Now ! Sam realized instantly that his moment had come . He slipped out of the path of light from the cabin door and , raising himself on his toes , walked noiselessly back to the Robin 's tail , then broke into a lightfooted run , back along the pavement on which they had just landed . The air was heavy with a cold mist . Glancing over his shoulder he saw that the plane lights were a blur behind him . He could no longer be seen . He dug in his toes and sprinted , praying he would not collide with whatever might be at the end of the runway . In a minute he had reached it , and stumbled suddenly into a growth of low bushes . Unaccustomed to this violent exercise , he threw himself down on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead silence he heard shouts over the field , and made out what could be the beam of a flashlight hastily swung around . They had discovered his escape and he was sure that they  --  especially Charles  --  would guess which way he had come and soon be after him , no doubt armed . He got himself on his feet and began to beat his way through the underbrush . The fog helped because it produced a glow of light where the plane stood , and gave him a perfect point from which to flee . A few hundred feet farther on he was  | among trees , small stunted pines , he judged by the feel . They impeded him somewhat and a painful jab from a branch made him slow to a walk . He found a boulder with his shins and sank upon it , trying to catch his breath . Suddenly a siren wailed out from the direction of the landing strip . It cried out long and loud , rising and falling with sinister insistence . Sam was on his feet instantly . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobilized heaven knew what crew of devils to track him down . They would have searchlights , perhaps even starshells or dogs . His only hope was to run , putting the utmost distance between them and himself . He stumbled on , and found that the siren also helped in keeping a direction . The trees grew thicker and slowed him down . Their needles brushed his face in a friendly welcome but sticky pinecones wiped streaks of sap onto his face and clothes . He ignored them and ran on across the sandy ground . It occurred to him that this might be Cape Cod in Massachusetts . If so , he should come to a highway before long , possibly even a town . A settlement would be the thing , for he would be safest among people . If he could only find a police station ! The siren was still blowing but it was much fainter now . He seemed to be going over the brow of a hill and down . He stopped to rest again and was conscious of a dull roar ahead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on Cape Cod . Then , abruptly , the trees ended , giving way to a steep rocky slope . A moment later he was on a broad , smooth ledge , slipping and staggering downward at a sharp angle . Sam saved himself just in time , landing on his knees on a rough expanse of pebbles . A beach ' The ocean ! The roar , louder now , was the sea . Now what ? This could not be the Cape , for its shores were all sandy ones . His eyes had accommodated to the darkness a little and the faintly luminous haze , that must obscure the waning moon , showed him a line of breakers out beyond . Definitely this  | was not the Cape but some much more rugged shore . Was he still in Maine ? He was well aware that with every foot he traveled he enormously complicated Storm 's problem of recapturing him . If he was on the Maine coast  --  much the most likely thin ; the shore would be deeply indented . From his memory of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of land with deep , narrow bays between them , and a town at the head of each bay . The question was , which way to go to reach one ? Sam stood still and studied the sky . It was important not to go south , along such a finger of land , toward the open ocean and end up on a narrow point where he could easily be trapped . There was no star in sight , not a chance of orienting himself that way . But there was another way that might give him the answer . He walked gingerly down the beach to the water 's edge and found he could see quite well . He could make out lines of ledges offshore , occasionally fringed with white when a wave broke . By careful study he established that the seas were coming in from the left . Since that would be the direction of the open ocean it must be south . Very well , then north would be the other way , to his right . He lost no time in setting off in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than rock loomed ahead . He stopped and listened . The waves made the only sound . He approached the object with extreme care , making little noise himself . Suddenly he laughed aloud . The thing was a small boat , a small open dory painted yellow , pulled up high on the pebbles . With tense fingers he felt inside and located a pair of oars , a bailing scoop and a rowlock in each gunwale . All ready and waiting for him . Fantastic luck ! A fisherman lived nearby , perhaps , and kept his boat here . Well , he would have to lend it to him . There was no time to ask . His breath coming fast , Sam seized the stern and pulled . The boat came easily , rolling gently over the loose pebbles .  | He was standing up to his knees in water before it refused to go any farther . He ran back to investigate and called himself a fool for not realizing that there would be an anchor somewhere up the beach . There was  --  a stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of a stout bowline . This heavy forked stick with a good-sized rock lashed between its prongs was better than a steel patent anchor . He seized it and carried it to the boat and loaded it aboard , then jumped in after it . Sam shipped the oars and rapidly pulled out and to the north , keeping in the lee of the outer ledges , judging by the sound they made . When he was in deep water he stopped and felt along the bottom boards for leaks . None . The boat was in fine condition . In the distance ashore he heard the faint crack of a rifle . They were still after him , then , probably firing at anything that moved . He considered his position quickly . The boat was light in color and could certainly be seen , even in this dim light , from quite a distance . If they located it they would have him cornered . His progress afloat would be much slower than theirs along the shore and they would inevitably capture him again . The boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set for him . His decision was immediate . He pulled inshore , grasped the killig and dragged it onto the beach as far as he could . Then he ran back and pulled the boat up above the water 's edge . It would be safer to leave it as he had found it . A heartbreaking decision but it must be made . Desperate for time , he made off across the beach and scaled the ledge at its north end . He did not know how much of a lead on them he might still have . Sam moved at his best speed over the rough terrain . His body ached from the unaccustomed scrambling . Some of the ledges were knife-sharp and cut his hands painfully . Once or twice he slipped on greasy seaweed and fell headlong into the water , then recovered and stumbled on again . He was wet to the skin immediately . The thin October fog cut him to the bone with its clammy cold . When he had gone what  | seemed a safe distance he huddled down between the rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was necessary to calculate the time and to figure how much darkness was still left him . He was sure the trip from ' 1'ornhagen had not taken more than four or five hours . That would put the hour somewhat short of midnight  --  say six hours more cover before daylight . If the location was indeed the Maine coast  --  it might be Nova Scotia or almost anywhere in New England  --  there would be time , if he could keep up his strength , to work his way up the shore of this estuary and find a town . He had to gamble that this would work . Uneasily he got up and plugged along , cutting his clothes and scraping his hands on the rough granite as he went . He found he livid to rest more often . Those days of sailing had not conditioned him for this . It was a desperate prospect . Sam lost track of the hours . His fatigue grew rapidly and the chill mounted through him . He came at last to a wharf , jutting out some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tied up on the side toward him . One light shone through a porthole and the sound of a radio rose and fell within . Sam froze in his tracks . What was this ? Friend or foe ? An overpowering desire to seek the protection of strangers assailed him . But his judgment told him not to take the chance . It could well be the enemy . Perhaps they had a big base here . He sneaked carefully under the wharf , laboring across a mudflat , then slipped and fell prone into a pool , making a loud splash . A bed of mussels cut his hands in a dozen places . It was a good while before Sam got up and started on again . Although nobody had heard him apparently , he had lost his confidence . Nothing but grim urgency was left . He must not be caught again . He knew that he had covered a mile or more ; the upper end of the narrow arm of water he was skirting might be five or ten miles farther on . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a while , as he rested , he thought he heard the boom  | of the surf again . This could n't be . Or , if it was , then he was on open coast , and there might not be a town for miles , and no place to hide till he found one . He hesitated , wondering whether to strike off inland on the chance of blundering into a farm . It was a poor bet . There might be hills , rivers , heavy woods which he could n't negotiate . No , he had better keep on as he was , putting every inch of distance he could between himself and his enemies . He stumbled forward , shivering and miserable . After a while a faint white object loomed ahead along a stretch of pebbles . He staggered to it . A boat again , a small dory . He felt inside automatically and found oars . The rowlocks were in place . He decided he had better use this one . He found the bowline and traced it up the beach to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the same killig he had found before , and , of course , the same boat . He waited for his mind to clear , and the stunning truth hit him . He had stumbled along the shore for hours and come back to it , without turning around . It could mean only one thing . He was on an island and had crawled completely around it to his starting point . He was trapped . He huddled in an ague of cold in the lee of the little dory , trying to think what to do . It was suddenly plain why Kara and Storm had been so careless about letting him escape . It was obvious why there had been a superficial pursuit which he had outrun . They had wanted him to get away ! Wanted him to find out for himself , cruelly , how impregnable his prison was . This was the fine , sadistic hand of the conspiracy , playing with him for its amusement . With the last of his waning strength he turned the boat on its side to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fell into a tortured sleep .  | IN HIS office overlooking the Charles River in Cambridge , president John Arkwright stood behind his desk , facing a small group of the guiding figures of the Eastern Technological Institute . He had just told them that Sam Bowden had disappeared . It was Monday morning , October 17 , and Sam was overdue at the Reading Laboratory just 24 hours . The president scanned their faces : intelligent , earnest men , each an authority in his field , each the head of a department at ETI . There was Everett Hancock of Chemistry ; Emil Trevor , that strange wizard who presided over Mathematics ; there were Frank Markham of the Aeronautical School and Theodore Fahnstock of Architecture and Jan Corici , one of the world 's foremost authorities on electronic switching , heading Electrical Engineering . And there was George Riam , ETI 's Dean of Science and Arkwright 's righthand man , the Executive Officer of the Institute . Together ,  | they made up the advisory committee , to which he always turned when some important matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downright serious . " I 'm sorry to have called you in on such short notice , " Arkwright said , noting that Hancock had come in his laboratory coat . " I know it is inconvenient . But the question is dangerously urgent . We must decide what to do about Sam Bowden immediately . I am the more concerned because I am responsible for his being lost . " The professors looked at him sympathetically but remained silent . The president waited a moment , then fixed his eyes on the serene vista beyond the window . The fresh blue of the October sky , streaked with a storm farther to the north , made a vivid backdrop for the stolid line of red brick buildings in the distance on the Boston side . A smart west wind ruffled the water of the river and heeled the little boats that scampered here and there under their picturesquely colored sails . " Let me hear your comments , gentlemen . What do you think , Everett ? " he prompted . " Why are you so sure he 's disappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he just be late ? " It was a typically unexciting remark , like himself . " No , Everett , he ca n't . Sam is n't one of the late sort . Besides , this is the day he meets the top brass from Washington on Missile F. " " Probably in Washington , holed up with a bevy of generals . " This was Trevor , heavy , potbellied  --  a Socrates with glasses . " Just omitted to let his office know . " He indulged his trick of sighing noisily as if the subject were beneath consideration . Trevor delighted to throw a cynical remark into a serious discussion to " gain perspective , " he always said . Arkwright glanced at him impatiently . " The man is gone ; we 've got to explain why to the Air Force  --  decide what officials to notify , what , if anything , to release to the press before they do . I understand from Sam 's secretary , Miss Amelia Burton , that there is quite a commotion out there already . "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't think so . At least I have n't heard . " " I 'll bet those two majors of theirs know , " Markham put in . " They 're like Geiger counters when there 's anything wrong out there . " " We 'll be hearing from them soon , then , " Fahnstock sighed . " I can deal with them , John , " George Riam assured him . " The concern so far , then , is only Miss Burton 's ? " " And mine , " the president said . " Miss Burton is an excellent barometer wherever Sam Bowden is concerned . She watches over him like a mother hen . " " Badly mixed metaphor , John , " Trevor observed wickedly , over his glasses . " You 're sure she is n't in love with him ? " " Nonsense , Emil , " Markham retorted shortly . " Let 's stick to business . " Arkwright waited patiently for silence . " She is badly upset because of this top-drawer meeting he 's supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fur will fly , you can count on it . " " Anybody else to take his place ? " Fahnstock asked . " You , for instance , Frank ? " " Not me , thanks , " Markham declined precisely , the literal-minded engineer from the top of his balding head to his well-shined shoes . " Nor anyone else . Sam is our authority on the Missile F job . They 're expecting him to give them chapter and verse from the beginning . Nobody else can do that . " " Can we persuade them to postpone the meeting perhaps ? " Jan Corici suggested gently . He was the diplomat of the group  --  big , blond , red-cheeked , resourceful . Arkwright shook his head unhappily . " I 've got them to postpone it once already . I 'd hate to try again . A key man in a place like Reading ca n't suddenly drop out of the deliberations without stirring up a hornet 's nest , especially if he 's  | disappeared . The Air Force , you may know , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bowden 's absence will have to be explained , and justified , before two o'clock this afternoon . " " Hell , " said Fahnstock vehemently . " You ca n't justify a disappearance . How can you ? " " I hope nothing has happened to the boy . " The words were so deeply felt that they sounded like a prayer . Everyone turned to the white-haired Dean of Science , whose thin , distinguished face seemed suddenly haggard . Riam , most of them knew , was closest to Sam Bowden of all the faculty . He had sponsored him through his student years at ETI and was responsible for his meteoric rise at Reading . Sam was his great pride . " I know how you feel , George . " Hancock looked at him affectionately . " You say you knew where he was going on this outing of his ? " " No I did n't . I was surprised to find he 'd gone anywhere . Especially now . " Arkwright brought them back to the main issue . " I knew where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polished surface of his desk . " I sent him . Keezar Lake , up in Maine . I made hotel arrangements for him , in fact . Sam was reluctant to go , but I insisted . He badly needed the rest . Anyway , he told Miss Burton he would be back at his desk yesterday morning at eight sharp to get ready for today 's meeting . He did n't make it . " " And now it 's Monday at eleven , " Fahnstock remarked . " What do you imply , John , when you say ' he did n't make it ' ? " Trevor asked quietly . Arkwright 's voice was strained . " That he could n't get back . What else ? That 's why it 's serious . Sam is always back when expected . " " It may be something perfectly normal , " Corici offered . " We ca n't assume that . He asked Miss Burton to come in Sunday morning to help him . She was on hand at eight- thirty . He did n't come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so worried she telephoned me . I calmed her down . After all , he had no obligation to make it back on Sunday . This morning she called me again when she found his office empty . " He looked at them with eyebrows knotted with concern . " According to her , Sam had some Missile F documents with him . " Fahnstock 's keen , long-nosed face turned sober . " You think ? ? " " I do n't think anything . That 's just a piece of pertinent data , that 's all . " " H 'm , " Hancock grunted . " Looks as if we had better find him . Quickly . " " You 've done some preliminary investigating ? " Fahnstock inquired . Arkwright said he had , at once . He had immediately put in a call to Silsbee at the Lake . The innkeeper had been amazingly glad to hear his voice . " Thank God you called , John , " he shouted over the noisy country line . " He 's been missing from here since last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night and we had breakfast next morning . Then he disappeared and I have n't seen him since . I 've been worried about him . " " Too bad you did n't begin to worry sooner and let me know , " the president remarked caustically . " Sam is n't here either . " " Oh , my God ! " came Silsbee 's voice . It seemed that the innkeeper had not been much concerned when Bowden failed to put in an appearance that Tuesday evening . Silsbee had been in Portland all day and did not get home till late . Then , for the next couple of days , he was busy shutting down his hotel and letting the help go ? a usually friendly duty marred by the chef , who got into an argument with him and stamped out of the kitchen on Wednesday , leaving everybody in the lurch . But on Friday Silsbee suddenly realized that Sam was gone . A quick check  | showed that his bag was still in his room . He had not signed out with the clerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might have lit out with one of the other guests , " Silsbee yelled over the telephone . " But the others were all present and accounted for . " Saturday of that week was the last day the Inn was open ? a cold , blustery , stormy day . Early in the morning the housekeeper brought up the question of the missing guest , asking what to do with the gentleman 's bag , which was still in room 318 . This brought up the question of why Sam had gone off without both his bags . The clerk was sure he had come with two , not one , so the mystery deepened ; evidently he had intended to come back . That was why Silsbee had n't done anything about his disappearance . " Arthur , " Arkwright interrupted , " did he have a briefcase with him ? It is very important to know ! " Silsbee did n't know . " Well , find out and call me back at once . Make it collect . " Silsbee had done so , but without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the help some days ago . No one remembered seeing a briefcase around in his room . Being no clerk himself , it had n't occurred to him to look in the hotel safe . Anyway , Silsbee had other fish to fry . " I only hope , " he cried , " that the young fellow did n't hire a boat of someone around here and get drowned . Blew like Satan here all last week . Not fit for an ocean liner . You have no idea ? " Arkwright had shut him off . He did n't think Sam had drowned . Riam shared this view . " I doubt like hell that he got into trouble with a boat , " he said positively . " That kid is a whiz on the water . He used to be some kind of a champion canoe sailer while he was an undergraduate . And he swims like a seal . " The president doubted an accident but had tried to check to make sure . He had called the deputy sheriff of the Keezar region . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go  | fishing and did n't relish chasing a stranger who might possibly have got lost in the woods or fallen into the lake . " With his suitcase ? " Trevor interrupted . It was n't irony . It was merely his mathematical mind at work . Arkwright got his point . " Yes , that incongruity occurred to me , too , Emil . The missing bag is evidence against an accident . " Corici wondered if Sam might not have met a friend and decided to visit him . The president said the deputy had assured him all the cottages had been closed long ago . " Very well . " Corici was ahead of him . " A friend coming by in his car and taking him to another town . " " In that case would n't Sam have taken both bags ? " Trevor stepped into it . " Possibly a very special friend , anxious to open a discussion Bowden could not resist . The friend took him off for the day but the discussion grew more and more fascinating . He forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Emil , " Markham interjected . " There is an unknown we have not yet found . " " I agree , " Riam said vigorously . " Such as Missile F ? " Fahnstock suggested . " Could he have gone off in one ? " No one laughed , though Markham 's eyes twinkled for a moment . " Sorry . Too classified for architects . I do n't know much about it myself , but I do know it is unmanned . It 's a weapon with unlimited range that you can watch on a screen and send all over the world . Atomic powered . Could stay in the sky for months  --  years , maybe . " " Sam Bowden , " Riam said proudly , " is the only man living who knows all about it . He invented most of it . " " That is ve-ry interesting , " Trevor mused . " Ve-ry interesting . " He was plotting something . Riam frowned at him , hoping to forestall any further wisecracks . With deep feeling he said , " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet he knows more about mis- sile design than we can hope to know . " He sighed . He felt tired and discouraged . " We taught him all he knows , ' " he quoted the old face-saver of teachers everywhere . There was a note of irony in his voice . He stood facing them all , his hair shining silver , its unruly forelock dropping onto his forehead . " How many times have I boasted about that boy , " he went on softly . " One in a million  --  the kind an old teacher like me clings to in his dotage . When he came here in ' 46 he was just a gangling kid , and in six months we taught him all we knew ! Literally . " He smiled wistfully , his mind at a distance with Sam . Trevor pursued his own line , disregarding Riam . " He had classified documents in that briefcase , you say ? " Arkwright stared at him sharply . " What are you getting at ? " Trevor shrugged . " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiosity about Missile F ? It has happened before . " The president was angry now . " There were no important documents in that briefcase ! That I know ! " " The Russians might like it whether it contained important things or not , " said Markham . " They would make off with anything . " " Now , gentlemen , let us be calm ! " Corici interposed . " The Russians are just people , like ourselves . " " Nuts ! " Markham was angry now . " Not the Russian spies ! I agree with Emil . The briefcase must be taken into account . These gentry are under our noses all the time . No doubt there 's a mess of them in the government . " " I agree , " cried Riam . " But I will not tolerate linking Sam Bowden with any of that gang . It 's preposterous ! " " Well and good , George , " said Hitchcock . " But you ca n't ignore the possibility . The minute the military gets into this they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatic . " Riam 's white mane towered above them all . He was shout- ing . " You know what that boy is doing at Reading ? He 's in charge of all the new ideas for this sector of defense . Dammit ! He 's got more responsibility for the safety of this nation than any civilian you can name except the President . " Trevor spread his hands in an elaborate shrug . " I did n't suggest that he was a traitor , George , " Hitchcock rejoined mildly . " Only , I think it would be a good idea to establish positively that he is not one . " " God Almighty ! Of course he is not one ! Any driveling idiot can see that ! " " Rye , " Arkwright admonished him gently . " You do n't have to be so vociferous about it . We all agree . " Riam was breathing heavily . " No , of course not . " He turned back to the window . " We can give the problem to the Computation Laboratory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lighter note . He smiled around the room . " Indeed yes ! For difficult problems there is the mechanical brain ! Would it not be poetic justice to find Dr. Bowden with the very device which he himself helped to develop ? " " Let 's not waste time romancing , " objected the architect . " Computing machines do not find missing persons . Or am I behind the times ? " " You would be surprised how far you are behind the times , " muttered Trevor . Arkwright had produced a sheet of notes from his desk drawer . " Our deadline is that meeting at Reading this afternoon . I have here the draft of a telegram to the Department of Defense . If that meeting starts without Bowden I shall have to send it , if only to save our own hides . " Miss Daggett , the president 's secretary , stood in the doorway . " There is a long-distance call from Keezar , Maine , Dr. Arkwright . Will you take it ? " " Ah ! " He reached quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a minute or two , mumbled a Thank You and hung up . " Just the deputy sheriff again . He says no  | boats have been for hire on the lake since Labor Day , other than Silsbee 's , and Sam did n't take one of them . That rules out a drowning accident , thank goodness . " " Why ' thank goodness ' ? " Riam demanded belligerently . " It only means that something worse has happened to him . " " We 'll see , Rye . Now , here is the message I framed up . See what you all think of it . " He began to read slowly . Secretary of Defense , Pentagon , Washington TOP SECRET This will inform you that Dr. Samuel S. Bowden , Director of Research at our Reading Laboratory , has disappeared while on short holiday at Keezar Lake , Maine . Last seen at lake Tuesday , October i i , but absence not discovered here till this morning . Inquiries so far futile , forcing belief that Bowden may be victim of accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort request immediate assistance locating him . Will afford you all facilities at our disposal and await your immediate direction . J. F. Arkwright , President , Eastern Technological Inst . Cambridge , Mass . " We 'll have to send it from Reading , over the Air Force controlled wire , naturally . " Markham whistled . " And all hell will pop in a hurry . That about foul play . God knows what DOD will do ! " Nevertheless , Arkwright insisted , it would have to be sent . " I do wish we could delay a little , " Corici pleaded . " Our relations with the Air Force are so cordial ? " Riam 's Yankee twang brought them all up sharp . " What do you want to do , Jan ? Give the Air Force a cocktail party and announce it there ? " He looked at Corici . " I 'm sorry . I should n't have said that . " " Now , " said Arkwright , " the newspapers . What do we tell them ? " " Nothing ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danced on his immaculate vest . " They 'd crucify us . Every re- porter in the east would be up at Keezar looking for him . " " Maybe that would help , " said Fahnstock thoughtfully . " I agree with Frank , " Arkwright said . " Anyway , we shall have to take those two majors into our confidence . So we might as well let them handle it from the beginning . Now , gentlemen , I will get onto it at once and ask you to be back here at twelve , with any ideas you have come up with . At that time we must decide on a campaign . Meanwhile , please keep this matter strictly to yourselves . " It was one of Arkwright 's typical dismissals . When the last word had been said , he snapped the lid shut without ceremony . In two minutes the room had been cleared . Only Riam remained , which was his privilege as Executive Officer . He was still standing by the window , staring out . It seemed to him that nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river had never looked more sparkling or the sky more benign . " That poor boy ! " he muttered , and then strode over to the desk . " It is serious , is n't it , John ? I 'm not being a sentimental old fool ? " Arkwright shook his head and smiled . " Probably the most serious crisis in ETI 's history . " " Just one thing , " the Dean said intensely . " We 've got to kill this idea that Sam defected with those papers . If those damned PIO 's out there get going on that line we 're sunk . " He fished in a sagging jacket pocket and pulled out an old pipe , carefully filled it from a plastic pouch just as old , and tamped the charge down with precision . The president snapped a desk lighter and held the flame for him . Riam sucked noisily on the tobacco . " You agree he is the victim of foul play ? " " I do n't see any other explanation . I know it sounds like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reds , then . " Arkwright studied the carpet thoughtfully and was silent for a time . Then he slowly shook his head . " I would n't doubt that Missile F would interest them , " he said . " But I just do n't  | see them trying a thing like this . There are better and safer ways of getting our secrets away from us . " " It is n't secrets , John , even secrets like the F. It 's men . " " That I do n't believe . At least not our crowd . Sam 's too big a fish for them to fool with . " " Do n't agree . Do n't agree at all . Sam 's big enough so they would want him . Think what they could do with him with brainwashing . " " With soldiers , maybe they can . Not with scientists  --  I hope ! " The Dean began to stride the room , puffing clouds of blue smoke . " Yes , scientists ! That 's just their point . Suppose they found they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for doing it wholesale , once they get in here and begin to run things . Sam 's a tough nut , and if they could bring him to terms they 'd just about have the job done . Hell , John , half this brainwashing thing has already been done , right here in New England under our noses . It may even be in this Institute . How come ? Well , for some idiotic reason the easiest guy in the world to brainwash and send woolgathering among the communist poppy fields seems to be the intellectual . That 's us ! I think Sam 's a dead ringer for this treatment . " " You 're going off the deep end , Rye , " the president objected impatiently . Riam lifted his lanky frame to a seat on Arkwright 's desk , pushing some papers aside to make room . He leaned forward for emphasis . " Deep end , my eye ! Suppose they 've decided to move in on the technical colleges  --  the mainstay of basic research ? Say they figure they can take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him , depriving us of his services at the same time . Neat trick , eh ? " The president pulled his mouth into a tight line of disagreement . " I 'd find it pretty hard to believe , that 's all . " " Why ? With dozens of the country 's best technical brains already leaning toward peace at any price , falling for every  | bit of the enemy 's rank propaganda without even realizing it , what would be more natural than to take a crack at people who are still loyal , like Sam ? " Arkwright was a man who had successfully steered the fortunes of an intricate maze of human talent : the solid , dependable engineers , the gifted , sometimes dramatic teachers , the wizards and wheelhorses of research , the few prima donnas of theory and practice . He had done it well because he saw all sides , all angles of thought . He offered the best in technical education , but he had done it by not taking sides . He was squarely in the middle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by all odds the broadest-gauge man he had ; just the same , Riam was an extremist in Arkwright 's view , which meant having strong , crystallized ideas on vital subjects . You just did n't do that in education ; you agreed with everyone and with no one . " You may be right , Rye , " he said , " but I think it 's an unfortunate mistake to go at this with our minds made up as to what 's happened . " Riam had slid off the desk and was pacing again . " My God ! " he cried , seeming not to have heard . " A college professor snatched away from his work by a gang of foreign spies ! Are we to sit here and let them do it ? Suppose we do sit here ? who 's next ? You ? Me ? All of us , one at a time ? Well , I propose to find Sam and make such a stink about it that they wo n't dare ever try again . " Arkwright looked at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I hesitate to mention this , John , but last night I kept waking up , tossing and turning . I had the feeling someone was trying to get something across to me . When I woke up I realized it was Sam . We 've been pretty close , you know . I like to believe there 's a kind of rapport between us , something like a communication line . When he 's in trouble , I seem to sense it , miles away ? " " Perhaps , " the president observed humorously , " I had better change deans. "  | " Perhaps you had . " The telephone rang and Arkwright spoke briefly to his secretary . " It 's those two majors , Rye . Now we 've got trouble ! " But Riam 's eyes were far away . " You know the story of the town fool who found the horse ? " he said . " When they asked him how he did it he said he had asked himself where he would go if he were a horse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't follow you . " Arkwright was irritated . " I 'm going up there to Keezar right now and have a look . Maybe I can make believe I 'm Sam . I have a sneaking idea I might make a better detective than the Air Force . I know Sam . " Arkwright sighed . " Very well . Call it official business of the Institute . Hand your expenses in to Miss Daggett . " Riam saw that Arkwright 's face was flushed with annoyance . The Dean smiled engagingly . " Do n't hate me , John . I 'm playing a hunch . Sam needs me and I 've got to go . " His long legs covered the distance to the outer office . Arkwright heard him say to the majors , " You can go in now , gentlemen . There 's work for you to do . "  | GEORGE R I A M , at 61 , did not consider himself a young man , although the students and faculty who tried to keep up with him , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to everybody , had the kind of mind that follows decisive reasoning with immediate action , that honors a hunch as the legitimate handmaid of reasoning , that feels exultant on new ground . As he pushed his Oldsmobile northward he realized with considerable relish that he knew nothing of detective work , was sure of nothing about it except that it did not follow rules nearly flexible enough to allow for absurdities when they arose . If he had not been so alarmed about Bowden he would have considered the trip a lark . He thought back fondly to a morning in the old Electrical Engineering Lab at ETI , when he had come upon Sam cooped up in the tiny cubbyhole that was his workroom as a graduate student . The boy 's desk was littered with fragments  | of cardboard , wire , batteries , a paper cylinder mounted on a straightened coat hanger for axle . Sam 's pipe was propped against some books ; he was so engrossed he did n't notice that he had a visitor . " Cutting out paper dolls ? " Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere . " Oh , gosh ! " he apologized , hastily sweeping up the mess . " I was just ? " " I know , " said Riam kindly . " Bored to hell with your thesis and putting off the evil day woolgathering . Good idea . Sorry the Thesis Board gave you such a dumb subject . " Young Bowden smiled engagingly . " Oh , it is n't that , Dr. Riam  --  Rye , " he amended shyly . " I 'm fascinated with it . And you know why ? I think I 've figured out a way to do all these routine computations with a machine . If it works I thought maybe ? " Riam surveyed the conglomeration with amusement . " Show me . " Fifteen minutes later they were still hanging over the desk , with a yellow pad between them . First Sam would sketch something , then Riam . Finally the Head of the Department leaned back in his chair and ran his hand through his graying hair . " It could work . Why do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave him permission to defy the Thesis Board and write this up instead . The Dean grinned now as he recalled the gamble he had taken on the boy . There had been some caustic remarks about favoritism in faculty meeting . Riam had roared them down . " Hell ! " he had told them . " You 'd better favor a brilliant mind if you 're lucky enough to find one ! " This was a particularly succulent morsel of recollection for Riam now . At the time he himself had been working in computing machines and welcomed Sam 's talent for them . It was not long before the two of them were a team . There at ETI , as much as anywhere in the world , electronic computers had got their start . And Bowden had been in at the bottom of it . Riam sighed . He realized that it was a father 's , not a  | teacher 's pride he felt . " Sentimental old fool ! " he cried aloud . Then , suddenly , he descended into the present with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time for action ! Congratulate yourself later ! Well before sundown he rounded the head of Keezar Lake and drew up with a loud squeal of brakes in the driveway of the Inn . As he expected , the windows were boarded up or their shades drawn . A heavy log lay across the drive leading to the front entrance . It looked like a dead end . But it was n't . After a minute the innkeeper himself came swinging around the end of the building , his canes making angry scrapes on the gravel . Still at a distance he shouted , " What do you want ? The place is closed ! " Riam got out and strode toward him , giving his name . Silsbee retorted he did n't care who he was , the season was over . " Come back next summer , " he told him rudely , and turned away . Good beginning , thought Riam , walking after him . " If you 'll keep your temper I 'd like to talk to you about Sam Bowden 's disappearance . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurried forward . " Why did n't you say so ? I know what happened to him . " In five minutes Riam had been invited to stay at Silsbee 's small cottage and the innkeeper had made it plain that he himself would take charge of the investigation of Sam 's fate . The Dean began to wish he had n't stuck his neck out quite so far . But he did clear one thing up immediately by making Silsbee open up the hotel in search of the briefcase . Silsbee said it was an imposition ; but , imposition or not Riam had to know . Fortunately , he cut the proceedings short by suggesting the safe . Sam 's briefcase was there and its contents were intact . The crotchety innkeeper retaliated by not letting him have it " without the signature of the lawyer for Bowden 's estate . " " Estate ? What the devil do you mean by that ? " What Silsbee meant was that the scientist had unquestionably  | drowned . Sitting over a sketchy meal the Dean listened to the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone to the bottom , no doubt of it . " I told that young fellow not to sail in that wind . He ignored me . I 'll drive you around the lake in the morning and show you where he capsized . " The Dean went to bed with his ears ringing , and next morning submitted to a guided tour . Silsbee insisted on using his own car , an ancient Ford with special heavy springs and a body that looked like a big gray bug . Silsbee said he had a Cadillac , too , but never used it . " Wear it out in a month , " he told him , and Riam soon agreed . The innkeeper , stiff-kneed and half reclining , drove by looking through the spokes of the wheel . He moved along smartly , straight through bumps and potholes , continually diverting his attention to the side , leaving the old car to shift for itself . They lurched by a cherub-faced native driving a team of horses . " That man buries ' em when we drag the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida in the winter and does a land office business . " The Ford missed both the team and a boulder that encroached on the side of the road . " Tetley Blanchfield . We 'll talk to him later . " They proceeded down the west side of the lake on a crooked , hilly road and Silsbee pointed out the sights by waving his arm , sometimes both arms , out of the window . But they reached the south end of the lake safely and Riam thankfully welcomed the paved highway that followed the east shore . " Along here somewhere , " his host said , " your friend lost his life , I 'm afraid . " " In that case , " said Riam innocently , " should n't the boat be around somewhere , drifting ? " Silsbee gave him a patient look . " A boat will sink if it hits a rock , wo n't it ? Of course it will . It 's on the bottom out there somewhere . The Sheriff will drag for it , sooner or later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think a wooden boat would float , even  | if wrecked , but Silsbee paid no attention . He had a Theory and that was that . " Well , anyway , " Riam changed tactics , " it 's all very sad for me , Mr. Silsbee . You know , I loved that boy . " Silsbee was businesslike . " Yes . I appreciate that . But if you want to find the body before the lake freezes over we must make the arrangements . " The east shore of the lake was flat , composed of many little coves and wooded points . The water was strewn with boulders , some quite far out . It was one of these , the innkeeper stated , that had done for the young scientist . Riam asked him why he was so sure he had drowned . " Because I know this lake , Dr. Riam . It is very dangerous here in a high wind . The small sailboats we have are n't fit for it . " Riam tried to look impressed . Do n't tip your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " If I told you that Sam was a champion at canoe sailing , would you still think so ? " It was the wrong move . " Canoe ! " Silsbee snorted . " You do n't know much about water , I can see that . People who risk their lives in canoes here , lose them . " Riam abandoned the idea of convincing the man . But the more he looked at the layout the less he worried about Sam 's coming to grief in it . He changed the subject . Had n't Sam given any word that he was leaving the hotel ? Of course he had n't , Silsbee scolded him . Would he leave word he was going out to get shipwrecked ? That drowning routine again ! It was really unfortunate that Silsbee had not received the note that Sam had left with the chef . It might have saved a lot of nonsense . Neither of them would ever know that the chef had deliberately withheld the note out of spite . He had simply chucked it in the stove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this end of the lake , caught the Dean 's eye and he got Silsbee to stop so that he could enjoy it  --  or that was what he said . There was a beautiful view of the distant mountains opposite and a broad ex- panse of gently sloping ground , with a few trees and a carpet of pine needles . What had attracted his notice was the tire marks of a car , turning off the road into this clearing . Sam might have come here , he thought , to commune with nature and take a rain check on Silsbee 's interminable talk . He decided to come back later , alone . On the way back they stopped at Gould 's store , where Silsbee hobbled in to buy some food . Riam tried to pay the bill , but the lame man would n't hear of it . " The reputation of this place means money to me , " his host insisted . " I 'll get to the bottom of the matter at my own expense . " Somewhat illogical , the Dean thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guest had been drowned here , but he let it go . Silsbee 's preoccupation with necrology might give him a little time of his own . On the road again Riam wondered aloud about Sam 's car . Silsbee showed interest . " I had n't thought of that , " he said . " Undoubtedly he left it wherever he hired the boat . That will give us a clue . Did n't do it at Gould 's , though . The old man runs a garage . " Riam said never mind , it was n't important , thinking that it was very important indeed . Silsbee regarded him keenly . " You 're a professor , " he said , " and of course not much of a detective . Well , we 'll soon find out where the boat came from . Only about five people rent them here , summers . I 'll take you to see them this afternoon . We 'll have the car by night . " Riam agreed he was n't much of a sleuth , except for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't murder , " he said . " It 's just that your young friend was a damn fool . " After lunch Riam said he 'd like to lie down . It was a little unhandy but he managed to climb through a window in his room and reach his car without being spotted . He was soon back at Gould 's store and bought some unimaginable kind of tobacco in the hope of starting Mrs. Gould talking . It did n't  | work . She was the taciturn kind . But she did say her husband was a mechanic and had never been in a boat in his life . Eagerly the amateur detective sought out the man and found him hunched over his workbench in the garage . Gould eyed him keenly . " Kind of late fer a city feller , ai n't yer ? " he brayed , taking in the Dean 's tweed jacket and polished shoes . Riam came to the point at once . Had Mr. Gould perhaps seen a young man named Bowden up this way lately ? " Sure I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just last week . Towed him in here , too . He wa' n't much of a hand with machin'ry . " Riam asked about the car . He said he understood Bowden had left it around the lake somewhere . The native 's tone was sharp . " You a detective or some-thin ' ? " " No . Just a friend . Thought you might know where I could find him . " Gould looked at him disapprovingly . " You city fellers do n't mind lyin ' , and that 's what you 're doin ' now . He ai n't here and you know it . Lit out . Disappeared . Some thinks he was drownded . Maybe . " Riam kept his eagerness down . " But you still have the car ? " " ' Course I do n't still have the car . He took it . Last I seen of either of ' em . " What day was that ? the Dean asked , striving for a casual tone . " Tuesday the i ith , " the man said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my book . That 's all that concerned me . " Riam liked his directness and said so . " You 'd of got farther with me if you had n't beat around the bush , " Gould remarked . " You be honest with me and I 'll be honest with you . I think he got lost in the woods . They 'll find him in the spring when the snow melts . " Riam controlled himself . " You do n't think he drowned then ? "  | " Nah ! I hired him a boat and he brung it back and drove off in his car . " Ah ! Pay dirt at last ! Riam wondered if he could take a look at the boat and Gould , muttering that he was too busy , took him out back on the marsh . The Queen lay as Sam and Charles had left her . The Dean whistled softly . Sam must have been pretty desperate to settle for a tub like that . He could n't have capsized her if he 'd tried . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked at length . " Think ? What would anybody think ? He just disappeared . Silsbee told you he drownded , did n't he ? Well , he 's crazy . Run into somebody he knew and lit out without telling anybody , is what he done . " " Did you see which way he went that night ? " the Dean asked next . The man eyed him . " How would I see that with it pitch dark ? He brung the boat back , hauled her up and lit out . I du n no which way . They 's three roads out of the corner here . He might of took any one of them . " Riam pursued his line determinedly . " Was anyone with him ? " " Now mister , " Gould protested . " I just told you it was pitch dark . All I know , he was alone when he come in to get his car . " That was about all to be got out of Gould . Riam drove off , wondering about the tracks he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was cheered . Sam had n't been drowned . Lost in the woods ? If so  --  and Riam could n't imagine it  --  the car would be important . He must find it . He parked his own car on the edge of the clearing and walked in to the shore , a few hundred yards . He saw at once that there were various wheel tracks , some in the earth , some faintly delineated on the pine needles . But there was no car . He made a thorough search and found nothing of The Nutrino . Stuck for the moment , he sat on a rock and drew out a  | notebook , jotting down what he had learned of Sam 's movements so far : Monday , Oct. io . Drives to lake , something happens to car , leaves it with Gould . Goes to Silsbee 's . Tues . Oct. i 1 . Hires boat from Gould , sails ( ? ) her down lake , possibly landing at small cove , east side . Wind too strong to sail back . Has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 8 miles . Gould receives boat , delivers car . Last , man to see him ( ? ) . Wed . Oct. 12 . Was Sam at hotel Tuesday night ? Or did he come back to the clearing instead ? Slept in car ? Fed up with Silsbee ? All depends on wheel tracks being Nutrino 's . Where is car now ? He stared at his pitifully sparse notations . If these tracks were Sam 's he did not stay ; in fact , he drove away in something of a hurry , judging by the deep gouges at one point in the piney mold . The wheels had dug in heavily before getting traction . Why should Sam have done this ? Was there something he had learned during his sail that had brought him back later by car ? If so , why had he not told Silsbee about it ? Well , he would n't have if what he had found struck him as important . The Dean put away his notebook and wandered about the clearing . It seemed to have been occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here and there were footprints . Presently he found something interesting : a short piece of insulated copper wire , the kind radio people use to connect up their experimental sets . It lay alone , as if carelessly tossed aside when cut . Had Sam brought some equipment ? Why on earth would he do that , coming up here to get away from radio ? Riam got down on his knees and examined the ground carefully . Near a tallish pine a patch of soil looked as if it had been dug up and filled in again . He probed the area gently with his jackknife . Something had been buried here , for the earth was loose . After a rno- ment he exposed the end of a similar piece of wire . Down about a foot it was attached to a small copper plate . Mumbling to himself the Dean straightened up , leaving the plate in place . The thing was no secret to him ; it was a radio ground connection . Some sort of portable transmitter had been operated here under this tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who could have wanted to establish communication in this unlikely place ? He walked to the shore and stared out over the lake , now gray under an approaching overcast . It could not have been Sam , unless ? His mind reverted to Arkwright 's office and the question of Sam 's loyalty . He shook himself free of the thought . " Hell , no ! " he cried aloud . " The briefcase proves that ! " Impelled by the shortness of the remaining afternoon Riam covered the clearing in detail . Before long he had found another item : a chafed place on the trunk of a tree close to the lake . It looked as if a rope had been tied here , about waist high . Rope to what ? Tent , maybe ? No . Campers drove stakes into the ground for that , and there was no other evidence of camping anywhere . Well , then , had a boat been tied here ? The Dean wandered about , thinking somberly of his inadequacy and then of the fantastic possibility that Sam had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio transmitter ashore and ? Nonsense ! Rot ! " Why in God 's name am I doubting him ? " Riam cried aloud , savagely . He was down by the shore when he found his next clue . On a large flat rock there was evidence that some metal object had scraped off a bit of its substance . He knelt and examined it eagerly . There were some silvery scratches , running to and from the water . With his knife he managed to lift off a few tiny flakes . Carefully he laid them on a page torn from his notebook and folded them in securely , tucking the package into a safe pocket . Someone back at the Institute  | could take a look at them under a microscope . But he knew what they were : aluminum . Why aluminum here ? What had rested on that rock heavily enough to chafe ? Sam 's boat ? No , that wooden hulk was innocent of metal . If Sam had dragged her up there would be bottom paint on the rock . All right ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or entirely separately . Some amateur who had dragged an aluminum skiff or canoe ashore . " H 'm ! " he mused . " Does this mean that Sam did have a companion ? Great stuff , this detective work ! A few clues and Inspector Riam solves the whole thing ! " He laughed without mirth . The original premise that Sam had been here at all was as flimsy as wet paper . He was making an ass of himself . Disconsolately he wandered further and found himself following wheel tracks out toward a point of land forming the south side of the cove . It thrust out quite a bit , terminating in a broad granite ledge . The tracks went all the way . Sam , if it was Sam , must have driven out this far to get a better look at the distant view , parking the car on the rock . Riam noted that the south side of the ledge dropped sheer into the water , forming a miniature cliff . The water looked quite deep . He stood on the ledge for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before him . Then he became conscious of a large boulder that sat out there beneath the water , a few feet from shore . He could just make out its dark mass through the still surface . Funny thing about it : the rock was definitely rectangular , like a big box . The Dean scratched his head , always keen on the scent when a fact did n't seem to fit . A square rock in a region where every boulder had been rounded by glacial action puzzled him . A little wavelet came in occasionally and would break over the sunken rock , revealing a dark surface that seemed unaccountably smooth . Intuition told him to investigate .  | stone caught and held . He had a guide line out to this mystery . George Riam had not been a research scientist all his life for nothing and his love for Sam impelled him to greater feats than were his wont . Without hesitation he decided to swim out and see what it was . He secured his end of the rope to a tree , stripped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . An insane thing to do , of course , for the lake was icy and over his head . Pneumonia , for sure . But he pushed ahead . Swimming carefully with the rope to guide him he soon gained the rock and stood up on it , submerged only to his knees . Instantly he realized it was not a rock but the hulk of an automobile , standing almost level on the sandy  | bottom . His rope had caught around the side mirror . R I A M stood shivering in his shorts on top of the wreck . His heart was thumping from exertion and dread . Had he blundered on the solution of Sam 's disappearance ? Was the boy sitting down there at the wheel , reduced to a meaningless corpse ? Could he have somehow driven off the rock in the dark ? Everything in the Dean 's experience revolted at the thought . But , cold and miserable as he was , he must make sure . He had seen The Nutrino only once and he was n't too sure he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some way of identifying it . He squatted carefully , took a deep breath and let himself down till he was lying flat on top of the car , then leaned down on the driver 's side and took a quick look under water . There was the door , tight shut . The window was shut , too . The interior seemed full of water . He stood up , breaking Out of his car the Dean got a length of rope and tied a stone to the end of it . After several tries he managed to heave the weight out far enough to land beyond this mysterious object . Then he pulled it in . Nothing . On the fourth try the  | the surface and getting his wind back . Steeling himself , he made a second descent and stared through the glass on the other side . The car had settled heading south and the afternoon light shimmered faintly inside . He made out ghostly seats and the wheel . There was nobody inside . Riam surfaced again , took a deep breath and let out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his skinny sides to get warm . He had made two vital discoveries . The car might be Sam 's ; there was no drowned body in it . But was it really The Nutrino ? When his circulation was restored somewhat the Dean waded out on the hood , screwed up his courage and pulled himself down in front of the radiator . It was tough going and his wind was failing . Crazy thoughts flitted through his mind ? thoughts of what Arkwright would say if he could see his Dean of Science now . Never mind . Go through with it . He focused his eyes on the number plate : " Mass 1963 ; 959,331 . " Dean Riam clawed his way to the surface with his last ounce of breath , then hauled himself rapidly ashore by the rope . Ile felt awful , but was resolved not to dwell on it . Get ashore , get warm , that was all that mattered . Then he cursed himself for a fool . The rope was still caught around the mirror and must be cut loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car the Dean swam , shaking now with an ague of cold . With fumbling fingers he cast off the line , pulled himself back and scrambled up the ledge . He gathered up the rope and his clothes and staggered back to his car , where he started the engine and turned the heater on full . There was a small bottle of whiskey in the glove compartment and he snatched this out and finished the half tumblerful that was left in it . The drink brought warmth again . Rapidly he stripped and dried himself on the car 's blanket , then put the dry items of his clothing on again , pausing only to write down the number 959,331 he had got from the submerged car . Considerably restored , he put the rope back in the trunk and roared the car up to the highway , heading  | south . He had to telephone Cambridge to verify that number at once , but not from Keezar . The Goulds would spread the news all over Maine and bring Silsbee down on his head . A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his map . He would go there . " John ! This is Rye at Keezar Lake . There 's something I need at once . The registration number of Sam 's car ! " There was some delay while the president got himself oriented , then another delay while Miss Daggett found the number on the faculty list . It was the right one . Arkwright broke in . " Look , Rye , the Air Force is in on this now , up to the neck . They 're sending a task force ' up there at once  --  a squad of military intelligence people under a Colonel Alpine . Officious fellow . Gave me a going-over for not telling him about Sam sooner . Hell , I did what I could . I sent that telegram to the Department right after you left . It is n't my fault if it takes their red tape twenty-four hours to unwind . Well , anyway , they 'll be up there by tomorrow sure and you 'll have to quit and come home . " Riam made some empty phrases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially now with the Air Force coming into it . " Now , Rye , " Arwkright objected plaintively , " please think of the Institute . Do n't stick your neck out . This man Alpine knows what he 's doing . He calls the whole thing routine . " Riam had an impulse to laugh . Instead , he reassured John that he would do nothing rash , and hung up . As he walked back to his car the seriousness of Sam 's disappearance was borne in on him . The car had been disposed of deliberately , by enemies who had been in the clearing to capture Sam , and who had had radio contact with the outside world . This was not the pattern of a gangland crime . There was no further doubt in the Dean 's mind that Sam had been taken by the conspiracy . On his way back to the hotel he stopped off at Gould 's and  | got another look at the Queen Mary . He examined her bottom ; no aluminum on it anywhere . A recent coat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been scratched by dragging over rocks . He scraped a little off the wood and filed it for future use , thanked Gould and headed for Silsbee 's , bracing himself for another ordeal . To his delight , the innkeeper was n't around , and he slipped into his quarters , took a hot bath and was stretched on his bed relaxing before he was molested . Rye was in no mood for listening to Silsbee that evening . After refusing point blank to tell him where he had been all afternoon , he pleaded a headache , shut himself in and got out his notebook . The car was the central fact so far , and it was empty . What could he conclude ? One of three things : Sam had jumped out and escaped as the vehicle accidentally fell off the cliff ; Sam had not jumped out but had escaped from the bottom of the lake ; Sam had not been involved . Someone else had deliberately driven The Nutrino into the water . The first alternative collapsed on inspection . In jumping out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to close the door . It could not have shut of itself unless it had landed on its side , which it had not . The second theory failed because of the closed door also . No one would stop to close a door ( and a window ) while escaping from a submerged wreck . So the one valid conclusion was that another party had done the dirty work after Sam had been taken prisoner . Riam wrote in the notebook : Third party shoved car into water to get rid of it , but did it so that it was easily discovered . Why ? Probably to make it look to cursory observers as if Sam had accidentally drowned , thus affording more time for getaway . The closed-door angle gave him some trouble . Only seasoned criminals would have thought of drowning the car , but they would also have left the door open , to make the job  | realistic . That they had n't , suggested to Riam that they had been in a great hurry . That indicated that Sam had n't known his car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Riam then , but did later . Next question : why had the criminals thought up so elaborate a plot to get Sam ? If they wanted to eliminate him , why not simply have shot him down in cold blood in Cambridge ? Obvious answer : they wanted him in good condition . The Dean had done much reading of late on the methods of the conspiracy . These people were no ordinary thugs but Machiavellian plotters who gave enormous attention to detail and always had a broad , overall purpose . Everything they did belonged to a grand scheme . The scheme here undoubtedly was " altering his viewpoint " by brainwashing . Riam shuddered as he thought of it . He had seen an Army training film on Chinese brainwashing of our Korean soldiers . His sister 's boy had had six months of it back ten years ago and had never been much good since . The Dean himself had served on a commission investigating Red accusations of American use of germ warfare . Everything connected with Red activity was a gigantic horror , the pouring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Brainwashing , which used every wrinkle of modern psychiatry , could overcome anybody  --  transform a person into a totally different one . He leaped up . They might be experimenting on Sam even now ! He had been missing for seven days already . Time was vital . He paced the floor , head bent , hands pressed against cheeks . This business of the human equation and its modern manipulation  --  how vastly different it was from the orderly step-by-step progress in the laboratory . How could you solve a kidnaping fast enough to save the victim , in a case like this ? There was a knock at the door . " Oh , damn ! " he said aloud . It was his host , of course . In desperation the Dean called out that he was resting  --  had caught a chill looking at the scenery . It proved an unfortunate admission . Silsbee went  | away but was back in ten minutes with a steaming hot toddy . This time he did n't knock , nor did he leave , once inside , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tortured evening , forced to stay in bed and drink medicinal booze he did n't want and listen to Silsbee 's reproaches . " If you had gone with me this afternoon you would n't be sick abed now , " he scolded . " I must say I 'm disappointed in your lack of confidence in my judgment . I have a great deal of knowledge of this area ? " Riam had had too many hot toddies to care much for the amenities . " One thing a scientist never does , " he replied , waving his pipe at Silsbee , " is to hamper himself with a foregone conclusion . You are so anchored to your drowning theory that you ca n't use your own head . " The effect of this upon Silsbee was not only electric , it was volcanic . It started him jabbering and pointing his finger and dropping his canes . Riam picked them up and thrust them at him . " Here , now , suppose you ? " Then he had a brilliant idea . He smiled on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell you what , I think I can help you . I learned this afternoon that the Air Force is sending a group up here to solve the case . The man in charge is called Colonel Alpine . I was told he is very confused about the whole thing . Out of his line , he said , and he did n't know where to start . So when he comes , take him in charge . Show him you know the ropes backward . He 'll welcome your advice . You may be right , you know . Dr. Bowden may have been drowned after all . " Silsbee positively beamed . " Say ! I was wrong about you ! Dead wrong . I 'll take your advice . I will certainly take your advice . " And with that the Dean gently got him out of the room . Standing with his back to the door he said aloud , " Sam , that kills two birds with one lie , maybe . Now , old man , we 'll get busy and get you out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , figuring , far into the night .  | Riam 's third day at Keezar Lake started badly enough . The sky was leaden and he was virtually a prisoner . During breakfast Silsbee was beside himself with bursting anticipation . After it the Dean took advantage of his preoccupation and " skun out on all fours , " as he called it , swishing out of the driveway with a roar as if he had official business of his own . He made it back to the clearing in fifteen minutes . Nothing was changed ; a search revealed nothing he had overlooked . He consulted his notes . Sam had been here on the i ith , for it was from here that he must have been taken . But why had he stopped here and fallen into the trap in the first place ? He had come first by boat , presumably . Then why repeat by car ? Obviously because he was still not suspicious . They had lain in wait for him , guessing that this was a favorite spot of his . Riam strode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he could see the bottom along the edge clearly . He walked the whole width of the clearing , staring carefully into the water , then out onto the point where he had had his adventure the night before . A tiny sand beach skirted the north shore of this point . On a submerged rock a few feet from shore there was a small streak of red . With some trouble he got the rock ashore and compared it with his sample taken from the Queen . They were the same . Sam had grounded here . This proved something but gave no help toward solution . Methodically , the Dean went about the problem as an engineer would  --  by making a survey of the area . Carefully he paced off the distance from the red-marked rock to the one with the aluminum on it , about 150 feet ; then from there to the chafed tree ? 6o feet . Then he sat down and made a sketch in his notebook , with dimensions . His drawing was rough but graphic . It showed the crescent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock was near the middle of the curve , the pine tree toward the north end , the red-marked rock at the extreme south . He returned to the aluminum scratches and studied them .  | What object could have rested here heavy enough to make such marks ? Not a boat or canoe . It must have been the end of a plank walk leading to a float out in the water . But no one used metal gangways to floats . The Dean stopped to light his pipe . Its friendly noisiness had helped him through many a difficult stretch of reasoning . Hold on ! Suppose another boat had tied up here and used a metal gang-plank for reaching shore . Nonsense ! Far too fancy . Besides , no boat big enough to need a gangplank could navigate Keezar Lake . Riam walked back and forth , trying to visualize the sort of craft that would logically come here from an enemy stronghold . Some kind of high-speed launch , probably . No gangplank , certainly . Much more likely they took him away by car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake ? Was Sam , even now , imprisoned within miles of him in some cabin ? The thought churned in the Dean 's mind . He contemplated gathering a posse of searchers and beating the woods of the entire area with armed men . In which thought he was more prophetic than he knew . The old professor shook himself out of this fantasy sternly . Fiction . Too complicated . Look for something simple as a cause , he always told his students . Details , not principles , are complicated . The thing you need may be right under your nose ! He examined the chafe marks on the tree again . If they were made by a rope holding a boat , there ought to be another tree with similar marks at the other end of the cove . It had been rough that day ; a good boatman would have used a stern line , too . He hunted long for evidence of this , and for a long time found nothing . Then he saw it  --  a thin sharp rock sticking up from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Put there , of course , to keep a rope from cutting , then left behind in the hurry of departure . Carefully Riam entered this new find on his diagram and added an imaginary boat and how she must have lain . The line of the ropes , he noted , did not cross the little beach  | where Sam had landed . There were several little beaches along the shores of the clearing , yet he had used this other one way out on the point . Ah ! Deduction ! The craft belonging to the criminals must have been here when Sam arrived by boat . Now the Dean was indeed in trouble . Sam had come here by boat , sailed straight into the hands of the kidnapers , rowed his boat back to Gould 's , then driven back here to give himself up ! It made no sense whatever . He must certainly be in a low IQ bracket as a detective , to be that badly confused . Yet , something had happened here resulting in Sam 's disappearance . What ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice question to ponder at one 's desk at home . But now Sam 's life depended on the right answer and there was not time to get it . At least not alone . He must seek help . Not from the military but from the FBI . They would know what came next . He must get back to Boston and see them . He was on his way to Silsbee 's before he realized that his discoveries might not impress the FBI at all . Why was he so dumb when his boy needed him so badly ? It was then , for no reason at all , that the truth of the kidnaping hit him . He had been repeating to himself , " A boat , a boat , a boat with an aluminum gangplank . It 's crazy . " And again , " A boat , a ? flying boat ! " He nearly went off the road realizing this must have been it . Many pieces of the puzzle slipped together . " That 's it ! " he cried exultantly . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailing the lake . Somehow  --  by letting him notice that they had a radio , probably , they had lured him in , overpowered him , loaded him in the plane and flown him away . His joy was great . Now , perhaps , he did have something for the FBI . When he arrived at the Inn the Air Force was deployed all over the place . He had hoped to sneak in , get his bags and ease out without causing a flutter . He saw now it would be impossible . Silsbee stood in animated conversation with a  | group of men , all but one in uniform . The innkeeper saw him coming and waved him over with a cane . Riam sighed ; it was an order . He 'd stop for a minute only . An officer with silver eagles on his light blue uniform turned and gave him a rapid inspection . Silsbee introduced them proudly , " Dr. Riam , Colonel Alpine of Air Intelligence . " Alpine was short and dapper . His ferret-eyed face held permanent suspicion of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's was long-fingered and cold . The small black mustache was precise . The Colonel obviously took great pains in clipping it .  | ALPINE did not introduce Riam to the others but turned and barked an order . He was all business . " Sergeant , we 'll take a ride around the lake . Silsbee , I will ask you to get busy at once rounding up the local people . Have them here at two this afternoon for questioning . " Riam saw the pained look on the innkeeper 's face and sympathized with him . But his turn came next . " I know who you are , Dr. Riam . It might interest you to come along with us . I understand you 've done some looking around already and no doubt have an idea of the geography here . " A soldier stood ready at the open door of the Colonel 's car . Riam did not want any part of this trip . He wanted to cut for home at top speed . But he had a hunch that he should stay , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat next the Colonel . The man who was not in uniform got in front beside the driver . The convoy of several cars got underway . After a moment the man in the mufti turned and  | held out his hand to the Dean . " Reginald Wayne , Dr. Riam , of the FBI , Portland office . Civilian , like you . " Riam caught a twinkle in the young man 's eye and it warmed him . The fellow was stocky , red-headed and possessed a broad , freckled face with a little humorous twist to the mouth . His keen gray eyes looked at you with intelligent anticipation . He was , Riam decided , his kind of man , which Alpine definitely was not . " Wayne is merely an observer , " the Colonel explained , " here at our courtesy . The FBI takes cognizance of missing persons , you know . But we shall not need his help . " " It 's my day off , you see , " Wayne smiled . At Alpine 's invitation Riam agreed to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had the feeling that anything he said to this man would be used by him without credit or consideration . The Air Force , it was plain , considered Sam one of its own and proposed to keep a firm hand on the investigation . Riam had no intention of preventing anyone from giving useful help in finding his boy but something told him that to cater to Alpine meant red tape and ultimate failure . A plan flashed into his mind . Why not give the colonel the submerged car for a starter ? He would love it . Meanwhile , he would take Wayne aside and tell him what he 'd found . It was a wonderful break having the FBI here already , even if only a minor representative from an obscure branch office . Much time might be saved . " There 's a spot down at the other end of the lake , " Riam told the Air Force man , " where I think Dr. Bowden may have picnicked just before he disappeared . If you care to start with that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Show us the way . " Riam gave the driver instructions and sat back . The Colonel was observing him closely . " Go in for amateur detective work , do you ? " The Dean laughed good naturedly . " Well , no , " he replied .  | " Except at examination time . " He noted that the little man did not register this . " And then , there 's a good deal of sleuthing to do in the laboratory . " " You run a crime laboratory ? " said the officer , perking up . He had not caught the twinkle in the Dean 's eye . But Wayne had . He smiled gently over the back of the seat . " Well , I 'd hardly call it a crime laboratory , " the Dean said , with a straight face . " Although we did have a case , some years ago , of a student who robbed banks in his summer vacation in order to pay his tuition . " " How 'd you catch him ? " The Colonel liked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , " said the Dean , " he had poor pickings one summer and tried to hand us a rubber check in the fall . Dropped right into our lap . He confessed and we fixed it by getting him a scholarship . " " I could probably have told you the fellow was a crook at the beginning , " the Colonel said . " But he was n't a crook , Colonel . He became a damn fine engineer . He just began being original too soon . We channeled his efforts and everybody was happy . " Alpine observed him frostily , aware now that his leg had been pulled . " In this matter here , " he remarked dogmatically , " the untrained eye will very rarely find anything of importance . But a drowning should not be too difficult to solve for we who are professionals . Detective work requires very special training , Dr. Riam . " " Most anything worth while requires training , I 've found , " Riam returned amiably . " But I make no claim in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have wasted my time . " " We 'll see that we do n't waste ours , " Alpine closed the subject . They completed the ride to the clearing in silence . Riam made them park on the far side of the highway to prevent them from obliterating Sam 's tire tracks among the pines . Then he led them to the high ledge where the car had been  | driven off , and pointed . " Dr. Bowden 's car is out there , submerged . It 's called The Nutrino . " Alpine gave him a glance of extreme annoyance . " Car ? Where ? I do n't see any car . What the hell make of car is a N utrino ? " The dean smiled . He was actually enjoying himself . " You have to swim out to it . That 's what I did . " Alpine considered his adversary for a moment , evidently decided he was insane , then turned , barking for his sergeant . The two conferred and the noncom hurried off to the cars . The Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there to look , " he said darkly , " but you 'd better not be trifling with me . " Perish the thought , Colonel Alpine , " the Dean said quietly . He watched while a couple of soldiers pulled a yellow object out of the back of an Air Force car and blew it up with a bottle of carbon dioxide . It grew into a small rubber raft . " You have everything , " he told the Colonel admiringly . Two men got into the boat and Riam looked down at them helpfully . " I 'm afraid you 'll need diving suits , boys , " he remarked . " The wreck is in eight or ten feet of water . " Alpine gave an exasperated yowl , then snapped out rapid orders to don skin diving gear . Riam was by now fascinated with this outfit of sleuths , who had come prepared for a deep-sea rescue . He caught Wayne 's eye , shook his head and smiled . The FBI man grinned back . The Colonel broke in . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Riam eyed him benignly . " Well , I know the car . It 's a small sedan , English . And it has the right number plate . " " How do you know that ? " " I dove down yesterday and read the plate , then I checked with the Institute by telephone . It 's his number , all right . " The Colonel glared at him . " You 're a busy man , are n't you ? " He went off to shout directions to his men .  | Wayne moved up to the Dean with a grin . " Hard man to impress , is n't he ? " " I have a hunch you 'll be different , " Riam said . " I hope so . " Thanks . I should warn you , though , that I have no authority here . Not yet , anyway . This is a bad week for the Bureau . The Attorney General has us all over the map rounding up diamond thieves , I believe . Anyway , the Colonel 's outfit should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " We 're in the same boat , then . " The Dean leaned forward earnestly . " Look here , Mr. Wayne . I need your help  --  badly . I think I 've found out what happened to Sam , but I 'll be darned if I want to tip my hand to that stuffed shirt . " " Would you care to show me ? " " I sure would , " Riam cried , taking his arm and leading him back toward the clearing . He talked rapidly . " The car is a side issue , I 'm sure . I 'll explain why I think so in a minute . The real clues are here . " He went on to explain his theory that Sam had parked here , then had been spirited away by some craft that floated . The car had been run into the lake to provide a false scent . Wayne looked back at the task force and grinned . " Their idea seems to have worked , " he said . Riam showed him the chafe marks on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , then introduced him to the aluminum scratches . The young FBI man was especially interested in the metal and got out a strong magnifying glass and studied the deposit carefully . " When did Dr. Bowden disappear , do you think ? " Riam told him it must have been on the evening of the i ith . " And it 's now the igth . Why was he kidnaped ; any idea ? Why not a friend he simply went away with ? " Riam smiled . " That 's not Sam . He was due back home Sunday and would have made it if he had n't been physically  | prevented . That I know . Besides , the car . That does n't point toward a friend . " " No , it does n't . " " I think I know , " the Dean said proudly , " what Sam would do under most circumstances . I 'm going on that more than on what shows here . " " Yes , " Wayne agreed . " A man 's probable behavior is often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm glad you think so . " Riam felt relieved . This Wayne was one you could make understand . He searched his pocket for the little paper of metal scrapings and offered it to him . " From the rock ? " " Yes . I spent half an hour getting them off with my knife . " The young man scrutinized them with his glass . " Aluminum , all right . Looks like Dural  --  light weight with top strength . How do you interpret this ? " The Dean was conscious that his sense of drama had made him save his idea of the plane . He presented it now . " H 'm , " said Wayne . " Why a plane ? " " Well , I ca n't imagine a boat big enough to need that much tying up being used to abduct a man on a ten-mile lake . An amphibian could have lain here comfortably . And , as you say , a gangplank made of Duralumin would have been logical . " " Yes , I follow . All right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grove and removed the earth from the small excavation under the tree , exposing the copper plate . Wayne whistled softly . " Of course , " he said judicially , " there 's no good reason to connect this with Dr. Bowden . But I expect you know what it implies if it is connected . " Riam looked at him . " Subversives ? " " Certainly a possibility . " " That 's what I figured . Too melodramatic , you think ? " " I 'm afraid it Can Happen Here , ' Dr. Ryam . They certainly have the machinery for it , and the intention . It was no  | ordinary gangster job . But then , Dr. Bowden was no ordinary man . " " Is , " Riam corrected . " I wo n't concede he is n't still alive . " Wayne searched his face sympathetically . " You 're very fond of Sam Bowden , are n't you ? " " Very , " the Dean said simply . " And I gather knew him pretty well . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knows ? no ? " . He was suddenly diffident . " He began teaching me in his junior year . " " Brilliant , eh ? Well , I 'll tell you what I think , Dr. Riam . A man like that would be much harder to make away with , even if you assume a skillful enemy . The snatching of businessmen and children is relatively easy . The victim is frightened or helpless and is no problem to handle . Now with Dr. Bowden it might be different . I do n't mean he necessarily put up a fight . But he probably did some fast thinking . " The Dean nodded vigorously . " The boy began rescuing himself the minute he was taken . Depend on it . " " Perhaps . Perhaps not . One thing sure : the crowd that took him were prepared for extraordinary circumstances . Bowden being a brilliant , resourceful man , they would have used their best people and their smartest methods . He might easily anger them and they could kill him just out of pique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Wayne . " " No , " said Wayne thoughtfully . " Afraid not . Still , it may help , especially with you in the fight . On an intellectual level you might be the one to know the best procedure . Did they ask for ransom ? " The Dean said no . Then he told the FBI man his theory of capture and brainwashing . " The poor guy ! " Wayne exclaimed . " I see what he 's up against . Anyway , we have to assume violence , and it probably began right here . " Wayne thought Bowden must have tried to leave some signal behind , something that would help  | trace him . They began to look for it . But in fifteen minutes of close scrutiny the clearing yielded up nothing . " Well , that 's that , " Wayne said at last . " I 'm sure he tried . I ca n't help being surprised  --  and disappointed . " The Dean had been watching him keenly , his thin sharp face furrowed in concentration , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think you 're wrong , Wayne . We 're missing something ? some thing intangible , probably obvious . " It was Wayne 's turn to stare at him . " What ? " The Colonel interrupted them , shouting and waving . " Our problem is solved , " he yelled . " Come and I 'll show you . " They had no choice but to walk over to the point . The Air Force men were peeling off their skin-diving suits and rubbing themselves down with big towels . " Good , " said Wayne , pleasantly . " All solved . That was quick . " " Routine . Completely routine , " the officer confided . " I 'm sorry to have to tell you , Dr. Riam , but your man was simply drowned . I 'm afraid he 's dead . " " You found the body ? " the FBI man asked . " Not yet . But we will . There 's no doubt of what happened . He drove off the bank here by mistake . The tracks show it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to make it to shore , or he died in the car and the body floated off later . " The Colonel began bustling about , giving orders . " Sergeant , locate boats and organize a party to drag the lake . He ca n't be far off . " Riam touched Alpine 's arm . " I think you 're wrong , Colonel . " " Wrong ? Nonsense . Very common case , drowning in a submerged car . How can I be wrong ? " " Because , " said the Dean , " both doors to the car were closed tight , and the windows were all the way up . " " Does that make a difference ? " " Well , it would to me , if I went overboard in a car . I  | would certainly try to get out at once and I would n't bother to shut up the car after I got clear . I 'd just swim off and leave the thing open , would n't you ? " The Colonel sounded annoyed . " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Any objection to that ? " Riam shrugged . " It 's a possibility , though it 's hard to believe there are that kind of currents in this little lake . We can settle it rather easily by measuring the movements of the water where the car lies . Alpine gave a short laugh . " You scientists are all alike ! I 'm a policeman , Dr. Riam . I do n't like to be cluttered up with experiments . I deal in facts . " " Well , " said Riam placidly , " in that case another fact is that there are no ignition keys in the car . When your men finally get it out of the drink they 'll discover that . It would really stretch my credulity to suppose that Dr. Bowden locked the car before trying to escape from it . " " There will be an explanation for everything , Dr. Riam , " the little officer said grandly , " even if it has to be made in Washington . " He gave the Dean a resentful look and strode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've missed something , " Wayne prompted when he and the Dean were alone again . " Yes , and I 've got a hunch what it is , " Riam returned , leading him well out of earshot . " Confronted with forcible abduction he would never have submitted without a struggle . But there 's no sign of struggle . " " Meaning ? ? " " Simple , " Riam pushed the point eagerly . " He had no reason to fight because he was n't seized ! He was invited away by a friend ! " Wayne considered it . " So that 's the explanation ! " " Does n't it fit ? " Riam cried eagerly . " Does n't it fit all we know ? Later , of course , the friend turned on him . " The young man stared out over the lake , pondering . " Friends , " he murmured . " Novel idea . I see what you mean ,  | and it 's not unlike them to try such a stunt . Only point : does Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my knowledge , no . But in the science field today we know there are many who do n't measure up  --  to the best standards of citizenship . I could name you some who have been found completely unreliable . " " I 'm afraid you are quite right , " Wayne admitted . " There have been some nasty betrayals lately . Anyhow , the friend angle appeals to me . It 's neat . Very neat . Puts a new face on it entirely . " " And makes it a great deal harder to solve . Such people would n't be in your files , I guess . They 're much more apt to hold responsible positions in government . " " Not nice , but I 'm afraid true , " Wayne said . " Well , anyway , it gives us a start . We might learn who his friends are . " " With a man like Sam that will take some doing . There must be thousands . " " We 'll see . Now  --  what about those car keys ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implied that he could . " Part and parcel of the same thing . His friends  --  those he thought were his friends  --  parked the car for him in the lake , without his knowing it , and brought him back the keys ! Sam supposed they had done him a favor . He never suspected what was going on until much later . "  | ( We left Sam Bowden cold and miserable under the dory on the island to which he had been taken . He had spent an uneasy night . . . ) SAM B O W D E N awoke to a misery greater than he had ever felt . Lying there under the little dory his limbs were cramped and bent , his clothes soaked and his head splitting . For a time he did n't know where he was . Why was he lying on a pile of pebbles when he should be in his bed in his Arlington apartment ? He had a meeting at the Lab this afternoon . It was Monday , was n't it ? Yes , it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantastic dream and get going . He struggled with the bedclothes A moment later Sam was on his feet in the frigid gray dawn of mid-October in coastal Maine . The wind was gusty and there were spits of rain . The whole thing came back to him like a blow . He was a captive on an unknown island . He had  | been out all night , soaked through . He was overpoweringly hungry . What to do ? His mind cleared under pressure of the problem to be solved . For a brief moment he stared at the dory and considered making another try for freedom . But in daylight that would be insane and he would die of exhaustion and exposure before he could reach land . No . He must give himself up , get in condition and then try again . Find the Storms , get fed , get into warm clothes . They undoubtedly lived on this island somewhere ; it could n't be very far . He saw that the beach he was on was small and the sea in front of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea . Great smooth ledges of granite hemmed him in and there was a ground line well above him , with bushes and trees on it . The island was not high , then , but he might be able to spot any buildings on it from the top of the bank . Painfully he started to scramble up the rock . Then , approaching him down the slope , he saw a figure clad in a heavy military coat , its head almost hidden by a pointed hood . Sam stopped . It was a woman of about the same build as Kara . So they knew he was here and were coming to fetch him in . " Dr. Bowden ! Are you all right ? " a voice came down to him on the wind , and its owner scrambled hurriedly towards him . It was not Kara but someone much younger . A servant , probably , another member of the gang . Well , it made little difference . He waited for her to approach . " I 'm sorry , " she cried , coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and lead you back to the house . You must be half dead with cold . " " I 'm not very warm , " he said savagely . " But that 's no concern of yours . Just get me in where I can get dry . " She pulled a folded blanket from beneath her coat and quickly draped it over his shoulders . He thanked her perfunctorily and started up the ledge . " Come on . Do n't waste time , " he tossed back .  | She caught up to him . " Do n't be angry with me , " she protested . " I 'm your friend . " " Like the Storms , I do n't doubt . Show me the path . Do n't talk . " She reached the high ground ahead of him . " This is the path , " she said , and waited for him to come up . He could not help seeing that she was young and good looking . He dismissed the impression . They were all good looking  --  Kara , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern . The girl tried to take his arm to help him but he shook it off . " Just lead the way , " he growled . They wound along a rough trail among bayberry bushes and loose boulders . Up here the wind was sweeping in over the island from what he judged to be the east . The cold was numbing . He was n't sure he could keep going but he would n't let her know that . " Where are we , do you know ? " he demanded after a minute . " On an island . " " Where ? How far from shore ? " " I do n't know , Dr. Bowden . " " You do n't know , huh ? Of course you know . But never mind . Get me back to jail . " He was brutal and meant to be . The whole panorama of his betrayal was vivid in his mind now and it rankled . From here on he would be a tough customer with these people , with this one as a starter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letting him " escape " they had made a fool of him . The ground they were traversing seemed to be the highest on the island . Sam took a quick inventory ; the place was smaller than he had thought  --  less than a mile across , slightly oval shaped . Small groves of scrub pine dotted it . Behind one of these on the east side he could see the roof of a large house close to the shore . It looked down on the naked ledges and the sea . Offshore , tremendous waves rolled in from the southeast . The west side of the island was flatter . There was a clear space with a small hangar on it ; below ,  | on the landward shore the roof of a boathouse showed , probably a duplicate of the one on Tomhagen Pond . She stopped again and waited for him to come up , meeting him with an open smile . " I 'm Johanna Kirsch , " she said . " I worked in Washington . You are Dr. Bowden . That 's all I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respond . He did not look at her . " You know enough , " was all he said . " No I do n't . I do n't really . " She seemed completely in earnest . " They did n't tell me anything except where to find you . " He took a cynical pleasure in explaining his professional connections , which of course she knew . " I 'm not talking about my work , to you or anybody else , if that 's what you want . " He was angry because she was a woman and his sense of chivalry prevented his insulting her properly . Miss Kirsch stood her ground . " I do n't see any point in your being a boor just because you 're cold and wet . I have n't anything against you . I 'm not even one of them . " Sam took this to be a lie . He pushed past her and strode along the path . He resented her for looking decent and forthright when she was n't . " Very well , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hoped I had found someone who was a friend . " The house had come in sight . It was a huge , gray-shingled affair , a relic of the day when the rich built enormous rambling summer places along the coast . With its many hip roofs and dormer windows , wide , ugly verandahs and fussy odd-shaped windows it must hold a hundred rooms . The place sat virtually on top of the ocean with only a jumble of boulders to protect it from the sea . There were several small buildings behind it on higher ground . The whole place was a horror of loneliness , exposure and outmoded architecture . As they drew near a dog barked somewhere and Miss Kirsch drew closer to him . Then he saw Charles , swathed in a great coat with a fur collar , standing waiting for them on a  | side porch . He looked greatly annoyed , and gave Sam a surly scowl as he came up . He was no longer the pleasantmannered technician of the day before . " She found you , I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a fool . " Sam waited for Charles to stand aside , then he opened the big entrance door and went in , ignoring him . The girl followed , also ignoring him . Tired as he was , Sam realized that he must be on the alert every minute now . It was to be a battle of wits all the way . Kara was waiting in the hall . " Well , Dr. Bowden , " she said sweetly . " It is good to have you back . " It was pleasant to see that he had caused them some worry , at least . As he did n't answer she turned to the girl . " You had no trouble finding him ? " " No . He was at the boat , where you said . " She avoided Kara and hurried off down the hall . There was a moment of vacuum . Bowden realized that he must adopt an attitude toward this gentry  --  a consistent policy , something to guide him whenever it was necessary to speak or act . The approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let them know you knew they were lying enemy traitors . Treat them as inferiors , with contempt and scorn . A large order , but it might puzzle them and put them off balance . He could think of nothing better to do , anyway . Charles came in and at once it was apparent to Sam that his little escapade had indeed got under their skin . " I see our guest survived in spite of your silly prank , " he said to Kara . " My silly prank ! " " It was you who let him get away , I believe . He might easily be dead by now , and you on your way to the same fate . " Kara was quick to note Sam 's keen attention to this incipient quarrel . " That will do , Charles ! " she cut in , her voice ugly . " You may take our guest to his room and see that he puts on dry clothes . Then have him come down for breakfast . " She stood waiting for both men to obey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . " A good substantial breakfast , too , Charles . Bacon , scrambled eggs , plenty of toast and butter , plenty of coffee . And I like the genuine English orange marmalade , not the American imitations . " He grinned . " Now , where 's that room ? " He marched off down the hall in the direction the girl had taken . Charles followed him hastily , shouting , " Hey ! Hold it ! " and taking the lead up the broad front stairs . A small diamond-paned window at the top only faintly illuminated a long , tortured hallway extending out of sight in both directions . A runner of Japanese matting zigzagged down the center . He followed Charles around a number of jogs and turns , past innumerable doors , all closed , and came to the end , finally . Charles had opened the last door and stood stolidly waiting for Sam to enter . The room was tiny , close up under a hip roof . It was plainly furnished with a small spool bed , pine bureau and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tunnel out to daylight . A portable oil stove smelled the place up and gave it a kind of synthetic warmth . Sam saw that his bag lay on the foot of the bed . Charles adjusted the stove wick , then returned to the door . " You wash across the hall , " he said , pointing . " Thank you . " Sam felt the hot column of air from the stove and it revived him . A sudden recklessness invaded him . On a crazy impulse he fished a quarter out of his pocket and thrust it in the man 's hand , watching his face . " You 're a good actor , Charles . Nice performance . " The erstwhile flunkey stared at the money for an instant , then shrugged , pocketed it and left the room . Bowden stripped rapidly , then found dry things in his suitcase and put them on , huddling over the stove . His mind was working at full gait now . By the absurd device of tipping Charles he had discovered that the man 's pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine who was in command here . Kara seemed to aspire to the role , but he  | was sure it was really Charles . So Charles was the one to outwit if he were to escape . With a sense of adventure , almost , Sam returned downstairs . This was a brand new field for him and he relished it . He was young enough to have bounced back from his harrowing experience of the night . A good meal would put him at his best again . Sam found the dining room with no trouble . It was a large apartment merging into a spacious living room through a broad curved archway . At the far end a massive stone fireplace threw out a generous heat from a pile of pine logs burning the way only a fire at the seashore can burn . The two rooms were on the east side of the house . Outside , across the verandah , he saw that the sea was pounding away at the granite foundations of the island . The place was sumptuous , and empty . Or almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat the two Siamese cats , ramrod straight , motionless , watching him unblinkingly . On a sideboard against an inner wall Sam 's eye discovered a copper chafing dish with an alcohol flame beneath it . He went to it eagerly and lifted the cover . Bacon and eggs , just as he had ordered ! He dished an enormous helping onto a plate , served himself from a big coffee urn , found toast and butter , and sat down at the dining table to deal with his emptiness . He was finishing the last mouthful when the Kirsch girl hurried into the room , glanced back to see if she had been followed and leaned over him . " Dr. Bowden , " she whispered . " I was telling the truth . I am not one of them . I am a prisoner here just as you are . You 've got to believe me ! " He took a swallow of coffee and got up , returning to the sideboard for more food . With his back to her he said , " And why should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was repeating her plea . " I can prove it . " He dished out some food on a clean plate and drew another cup of coffee and offered them to her with a mock  | bow . " Here . And thanks for coming to get me this morning . " For a moment they faced each other ; then her eyes dropped and he turned to replenish his own plate . One of the cats yowled softly and the girl moved quickly to the other side of the table . " Look out ! She 's coming . " Kara came in then but passed through the dining room and went to the fireplace where she knelt and petted her cats . " That cat got its signals mixed , " Sam called to her helpfully . " It warned us you were coming . " Kara stood on the rug , regarding him thoughtfully , but made no retort . A moment later Storm came in , filling the room like an ocean liner . He was dressed in slacks and his flaming red brush looked to Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so garish . He boomed out a greeting intended to be cheerful and went to the sideboard , where Kara joined him . Plates in hand , they sat down opposite Sam . Storm lifted a big forkfull of scrambled eggs into his mouth and looked across at him . " Well , glad to see you 're in good condition , Sam , " he began . " Tough night you had . Eat all you can hold . There 's plenty more in the kitchen . " " I 'm doing very well , thanks , " Sam replied quietly . " Your cook is an expert , as our friend Silsbee would say . " Storm grinned . " The best . We got him from the Waldorf in New York . " He was in an expansive mood and opened up with a running fire of conversation about the island , the weather and Sam 's bout with exposure . Kara maintained a severe silence , obviously disapproving her husband 's garrulousness . They both ignored the girl , who kept her eyes on her plate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's enough for now , Philip , " she purred . " You do n't have to play the country squire today . " The big Icelander ignored her . " By the way , " he boomed . " You two young people have n't met formerly . This is Miss Kirsch , Johanna Kirsch . Dr. Bowden . " " We met outside , " Sam said briefly .  | Storm went on irrepressibly . " Miss Kirsch comes from my laboratory at the Bureau of Mines . A talented technician . We call her ' Hanni ' for short . You should , too . " His eyes twinkled ' wickedly . " Charles says ? " Kara cut in . " Drink your coffee and shut up ! " It was an order . a " Charles says she 's  --  er  --  very talented , " Storm persisted . The Kirsch girl rose suddenly and walked rapidly out of the room . Storm chuckled . " She 's too modest , " he guffawed . " Takes herself too seriously . " Sam felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt , to give Charles a diversion from his kidnaping duties . " " An attractive idea , Sam . But you know , he tells me he has n't been able to get to first base with her . None of us has . Disappointing , very . Now you  --  maybe you can break the ice for us . " " It could be , " said Kara witheringly , " that Dr. Bowden does not have the same preoccupation you have , Philip . " Sam 's face was flushed . " No , I do n't . " He leaned toward them over the table . " Now I think it 's time we got a few things straight . So listen , both of you . I 'm here as your prisoner because you betrayed me as your friend . I was surprised and hurt at first , but not any more . I realize you could n't behave in any other way ; this is how you and your crowd of subversives do business . All right , you took advantage of my innocence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you this : You 're not going to succeed with me . Whatever you do you wo n't get what you 're after , either from me or from any other decent American . Once we 're aroused we do n't come easy . A lot of us are n't the dupes you 're used to taking over in other countries . This time you 've got yourselves a tough opponent and I 'm here to prove it to you . I 've never laid hands on another human being in my life , but so help me , this time I will . I 'll gladly kill you  --  both of you  --  if I get the chance . You 'd better watch out that I don't. "  | He took a deep breath and got up , feeling a little dizzy in the depths of his anger . The Storms stared at him , speculatively . He took a final shot . " What you do with the Kirsch girl is your own business . But do n't think you can push me around and get away with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't expect me to take it lying down . " Storm suddenly threw his head back and roared . " Bravo , Sam ! Bravo ! That 's the spirit we like to see . You wo n't get away with it , but we hope you 'll try . " Kara was smiling approvingly . Sam glared down at them . " We 'll see , " he growled and stalked out of the dining room . His rage carried him to his quarters without his being aware of the trip . With the door slammed shut he stood in the middle of the place and realized that , for all his brave defiance , he had probably made a mistake . What could the conspiracy possibly care for his threats ? What chance had one man , completely in their power ? He rummaged through his suitcase and found his notebook . Then he stood over the greasy little stove and began writing an account of the last few hours . It might survive if he didn't.  | By THE TIME he had finished his notes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had . It was better to have made a declaration . They were at war with him , so naturally he was at war with them . " All right , Bowden , " he said aloud , " let 's get at it . " An understanding of the nature of his prison was essential . The window interested him first . He examined it . It was a casement type and faced east and was leaking . But it would open , which was important . Right under it the gently sloping roof of the main verandah offered an easy path to the ground , he judged , with not too much of a drop . A very small closet shared the dormer with the window but there was nothing in it but a fragment of an old Boston Transcript of 1904 . He put this in his suitcase for further reference . There was nothing else of the slightest importance any- where in the room . He opened the door and listened , preparing for a tour of exploration . Hearing nothing , he moved noiselessly along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he passed . There were eleven of them , including his own and the bathroom . All were tight shut . Some might be closets or stairways , it was n't safe to open them to see . Say , though , there were three bedrooms on each side , six in this wing , anyway . Were they occupied ? Halfway along the hall he noted a narrow stairway tucked into a recess , leading up to the attic , presumably . He decided not to try that now . Just beyond the main stairway down , a side hallway branched off to the left , again lined with closed doors on both sides . This looked like a later addition to the house  --  brighter and cheaper woodwork , a strip of linoleum along the floor . Sam guessed this might be where the servants had lived , or , in this case , the staff of bully boys the operation maintained . From the further end of this hall he could hear the clatter of dishes . No doubt a stairway at that end led down into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his mind and started back . The house apparently formed a big L , with various excrescences . He would have to He stopped dead . Behind the door he was passing voices were raised . Without hesitation he moved close to it and stood stock still , his ear as near the door panel as he could get it . Charles was talking . " I do n't care ! " he was shouting angrily . " Whether you like it or whether you do n't . So it is your house . We are here now and it will be ours for as long as we choose to stay . You will take orders exactly the same as the others . And you are not going to the mainland until I say you may . " There was a grumble , another voice , a weak one . It sounded feeble and old . Charles had more to say . " And as for your power boat , we have taken that over , too . With our own crew . We paid yours off and discharged them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Sam heard more protesting murmurs , then silence . Footsteps that he judged belonged to Charles approached the door . Rapidly he moved away down the hall . He must n't be caught . When he was safe inside his own room he made a small sketch of the second floor layout in his notebook and identified the door where the conversation had taken place . It was near the head of the stairs on his own side . He was speculating on where the various people slept when there was a single sharp knock on his door . He hid the notebook swiftly . " Yes ? " The door opened and Storm came in . " Ah , Sam , I waited until you had finished your look around , " he said smiling . " I did n't want to interrupt . " He walked across to the scientist . " We expected you to explore , but I must say you 're not wasting any time . " " So ? " Sam flung back defiantly , covering his guilt . He should have known that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no doubt . Storm was smiling down at him indulgently . " It 's no use your being angry . You 're stuck with us . Why not cheer up , at least while you 're here ? " " So ? " Sam said again . The big man hesitated , regarding him with annoyance . Then he turned to the window . " You would n't have any trouble getting out here and down over the porch roof . We can expect you to try it tonight , perhaps ? " Sam merely shrugged . Storm 's cheeks showed spots of angry red . " Are you going to be yourself or do we have to knock some sense into you by force ? " he demanded . Sam smiled at him . " I told you downstairs that I intend to raise hell with you every inch of the way , Philip . " " Very well . Get your overcoat on and we 'll take a walk . " " Do n't want to . It 's raining . I 've been out in it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Storm retorted . " I have oilskins downstairs . " Sam waited . Should he force this minor issue ? He decided  | not , and followed Storm into the hall . The Icelander stopped in front of one of the doors . " I can save you some embarrassment , " he said nastily . " This is Hanni 's bedroom here . You may want to know . Kara and I are down there and Charles is along in the other wing . We wo n't bother you . " " Thanks for the blueprint . " Sam was pleased with the sarcastic tone he had acquired . Scientists are usually good with this rapier-like weapon of the quick comeback . He knew Storm was an amateur at it and could easily be beaten . " Who 's the old man down at the end ? " he asked without warning . Storm grunted . " You know about him , too , then . " " You have to remember I 'm a laboratory director , Philip . It 's my job to know the personnel I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way below . Encased in yellow oilskins they were soon out in the weather and reached the path on the ragged edge of the island in front of the house . The wind had risen to a gale ; the great ridges of the Atlantic came driving toward them with a boom and a roar that engulfed them . For the moment they were unable to go on . Storm stood up to the gale like a Viking . With his great red beard flattened against his face he looked to Sam like the incarnation of Satan . " Magnificent , is n't it ? " the Icelander bellowed . " Look at that one coming in now ! " They watched a vast hump rise out of the welter in the distance and move majestically toward them , mounting to a great ridge and then to a menacing green knife-edge above them . When it seemed about to overwhelm them and their little island it smashed against the outer ledges , erupting into a burst of flying white that drove its spray like buckshot into their faces . Sam felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a clean , naked , elemental force ; it was good . Contrasting sharply with the meanness and deceit of this toy giant and his people , it gave the scientist a sense of invincibility . With nature on his side he could n't be beaten . His waning courage had come back . " Come on , let 's walk ! " he shouted and pushed  | along the path . They breasted the gale around the island , stopping often to gaze at the mighty display of power , as wave after wave sent its shattered substance lacing among the rocks . Now and then there would be a lull , as though the forces at work had tired . But the next instant the sea would be mountainous again . They paused , finally , in the shelter of a jutting ledge , and Storm put his hand on Sam 's shoulder . Sam jerked away . " Keep your hands off me ! " he muttered . " Cut out this fairytale of friendship . We 're against each other . Let 's have the courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . We 're all in the same boat , pawns of history , caught up in something a great deal bigger than any of us . I 'm not against you and you 're not against me . We 're cooperating in the making of a new world ! " " Believe that drivel if you want , " Sam yelled back , expelling a mouthful of wind against the gale . " I do n't . History is just your excuse for murder . " " What can you do about it ? " " Plenty ! " Storm had him by the arm and was propelling him along the path again . It was beyond Sam 's strength to wrench himself free . " Splendid ! " the big man said . " It wo n't be dull for you , then . You can begin by trying to escape again . But I advise you to do it soon . They wo n't leave you here long . " " Who is they ? " " I do n't know . If I knew I would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sent off in a few days to some vessel of the fishing fleet . " Sam had heard of the Russian fleet of camouflaged fishermen who had hung offshore for several years , making God knew what measurements , ruining the fish by plundering everything in fine-mesh nets . Since they were in international waters no one could touch them . The U. S. Navy could only watch . Imprisonment on a " fisherman " meant about the same thing as Siberia . It must be avoided at all costs .  | He tried a new tack . " How far is this island from shore ? " " Well , " Storm replied , " unless you 're a Channel swimmer it 's too far . Especially at night . Strong currents , mostly setting out to sea . " " I asked how far . " " Nineteen miles to the nearest mainland . One rock along the way that is submerged at half tide . " " Sounds like a long swim , " said Sam cheerfully . " What about ships ? " " None . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why we chose it . " " Clever , are n't you ? So you wo n't hold me , but let me try . Well , Mr. Storm , do n't be too sure . It 's the impossible that does the trick . " Storm laughed derisively . " You Americans live by gimmicks . That one does n't alarm us . " Sam grinned at him . " I like your distinction . You 're an American citizen , too , Philip . Difference is , you 're a traitorous one . " " Proud of it , " Storm asserted . " But let me finish about the land . Take messages in bottles . Might save you eventually , if we kept you here long enough , which we wo n't . Besides , there are no bottles . Charles has the shore policed . There 's not even driftwood . " Sam did n't bother to react to this , but asked where the island was , and was told it was " off the east coast of North America . " Which meant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd assume so . " Within , say , 300 miles of Tomhagen , " he calculated rapidly . " Let 's see , now , what I 've learned . You tell me if I 'm wrong . The island is nineteen miles at sea . Assuming you 're lying , call it ten or twelve . " " Why only three hundred ? " Storm asked , really curious . Sam said it could n't be more ; Maine was n't big enough . Of course , the Robin had more range than that and they could have taken him to northern Nova Scotia , perhaps .  | " But I think it 's Maine . If you had had wing tanks you might manage Cuba , with a stopover at Bermuda . I recommend them if you have to make a getaway in a hurry . " Storm laughed . " If we ever have to make a getaway , we 'll use the fishing fleet . Fifty miles out and we can thumb our noses at you . " They walked along again . The wind had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Say the island is twelve miles out . That indicates we 're in the mouth of a deep bay fed by a river , because of the seaward currents you mentioned . More evidence for Maine . There are no deep bays with rivers anywhere else on the north Atlantic coast except Portland Harbor and Halifax , where you would n't go . Most likely it 's the Penobscot region . Quite lonely islands off there . Now , next point . Your NKVD man collects bottles and driftwood from the beach , which shows that he 's afraid the currents do reverse and go inshore sometimes . Right , so far ? " Storm had started on again . " I want to show you something along here , " he shouted back . " Do n't keep me waiting . " They came to a low promontory hidden from the house on the south extremity of the island  --  south , Sam judged , because the seas were slanting in somewhat from their left ? from the southeast . On the tip of the cliff stood a compact rcund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighthouse , complete with glass-enclosed top . It was about twenty feet high ; its walls , which sloped inward toward the top , looked massive and sound . A heavy iron door faced them . " Ah , " said the scientist , getting in his word before Storm could . " The ideal prison for solitary confinement ! Bread and water and seagulls for company till I see the light as Moscow sees it . " Storm cut through his discourse to say that the tower was not a government beacon but merely the conceit of the original owner of the island , who had kept a light burning to warn shipping away .  | " Interesting , " Sam pondered aloud . " The man who bought this island must have been rich  --  probably a retired business executive and no fool . Yet he built a lighthouse to warn shipping where there is none . Come again , Mr. Bolshy . " He approached the building and ran his hand over the concrete surface . " Not more than a few months old , I 'd say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long . " Storm was rattling a big padlock and getting a key into it . He swung the door back . " See if this amuses you , " he said tightly . Sam peered in with interest , then followed his host into a damp and dark space , with a curving iron stairway leading upward . They climbed it , Storm in the lead , and came out shortly through a trap door onto a circular platform , entirely glassed in . The beacon mechanism was supported on a central steel framework and looked authentic  --  the usual groups of ribbed Fresnel lenses surrounding what appeared to be an acetylene burner . It was obviously in working condition . There was even a slight sweetish odor of the gas in the air . " Nice view from here on a sunny day , " Storm changed the subject . " When it 's clear enough you can just make out the mainland to the west . " Sam studied the shore at their feet . " Maybe sixty feet above mean tide , " he calculated . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 15 miles , unless there are mountains on it . Beyond that , it 's below the horizon at this height . Well , that checks my twelve miles then . " Storm ignored him . Pointing to seaward he said , " The government maintains a gas buoy south of here about six miles to mark the end of the reef we 're on . And there 's another one eight or nine miles north . " He added that Sam might just possibly swim the distance if he knew which way to go . " I know , " Sam bantered . " And hang on until somebody came by or the lighthouse tender pulled the buoy to clean it ? maybe be next summer . Great . I 'll keep it in mind . " They looked at each other with something close to hate .  | " You 'll take it seriously by and by , " Storm said heavily . " You do n't fool me a bit . " " Oh , do n't mistake me , " the scientist countered . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got me dead to rights . No doubt about it . There is n't a thing I can do . What 's the plan , by the way ? You have n't told me yet . " " You will find out in good time . Your team will leave this week . " " My team ? Well , well . Are you kidnaping some more scientists ? Anybody I know ? " Storm might be tricked into boasting again . " That you will learn when we are ready . " " No . Now . After all , Storm . You 've got me cold . I ca n't get the information ashore . " Storm drummed on the glass . It was apparent that he did want to boast , and could n't resist it . " A team . They want to study you in action . " " Action doing what ? Sabotaging Moscow ? " " You wo n't be committing any sabotage , my friend . They intend to make good citizens of you . " " Tell me about this team . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . I suppose several kinds of specialists . A team such as this country has in its defense industries . " Sam thought that over . The mad kidnaping he was involved in began to make sense . It was not himself alone that they wanted , but a group to experiment on . " Pavlovian reactions , eh ? I wag my tail when you fellows say Khrushchev , is that it ? " " You wo n't find it funny , Sam , " Storm observed . " I 'm sorry , believe me . I am not happy to do this to an old friend . " " Oh , I 'm sure you 're not , " Sam retorted with great sarcasm . " And Kara is in tears over betraying a guy she was lining up for a lover . As for Charles ? " The Icelander fingered the big fluted lenses of the light . " Amuse yourself if you like . You have n't much time . Three or four days at most . " Sam thought he heard a slight rattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panels must be loose . An idea flashed through his head . To cover it he said , " The light . Of course . For the fishing fleet , is n't it ? " Storm shrugged but did n't answer . Sam tried him from another quarter . " What about the Kirsch girl ? Is she in this group picnic of yours ? Or is she just for Charles  --  oh , yes . And me , of course . " Storm refused the bait , turning away . Sam thrust at him again . " No , not me . Your wife is the one I 'm slated for . She likes me , Philip . " Storm failed to get angry . " She is n't my wife . I never saw her before we began this project . " He moved toward the stairs . " We will go back now . " " Just a minute . Not quite enough explanations yet . Who is the old man you keep shut up in his room ? " " I do n't know what you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew he had told too much . " Old stuff , Stormy . You 'll have to do better than that . I heard Charles bawling the hell out of him this morning . " Storm hesitated . " He 's the owner of the island . We  --  rent it of him . " " I bet ! Another prisoner , then . Is he going across with us ? " " No . We need him here . He 's glad to help us . He finances us . " Another lie , I suppose . " But Storm had taken him by the arm and was forcing him toward the stairs . Sam wriggled loose . " I 'll walk by myself , if you please , " he said . As he passed the central light pedestal , following Storm , he seized the lens Storm had made to rattle . To his relief , it was loose . A quick yank brought it away . It was a big thing , perhaps a foot square and an inch or two thick  --  a splendid weapon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against everything he believed in . But this was war The flaming red head was just below him as he came to the edge of the stair well . If the blow that Sam aimed with all his strength had struck fairly it would have crushed Storm 's  | skull like an egg . But at the crucial moment the Icelander turned to see if he was following . The glass spent its impact in a crunching blow on the shoulder . Storm gave a yell and slid forward down the stairs on his back . Sam leaped after him , intent upon getting outside . What he would do next he did not know . A figure emerged from the shadows below and the shadows rose suddenly into Sam 's face and enveloped him . Something seemed to wrap around his head and squeeze it in a vise , and the jar of it against his left ear persisted through many hours , like the noise of a gunshot reverberating through a long tunnel .  | THERE WERE sounds in the fuzzy darkness around him . He realized that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they meant nothing ; they were only intolerable jabs at the monstrous focus of pain somewhere at the back of his skull . He tried to cry out in protest against being struck any more . Then gradually the jabs turned into painless noises and the noises separated themselves into words . Sam lay still , unable to move . But he could comprehend . . . . and if he does not come out of it , so help me , Charles , I will send in a report that will have you shot . Naked , in the snow , my dear . I have prepared too complicated to understand . But the voice was familiar . By studying it hard he divined it was Kara . And Charles was the one she was threatening . So they were having a fight . Good . Why did he care ? Then he knew , and the whole miser- able business flooded back to him . Instantly he was on the alert . These two thought he was unconscious . If they talked some more he might learn something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you old hag , " was what Charles said next . " Anyway , I did it to defend Philip . That fool ! " Good , again . They all hated each other . I-ie was delighted to hear what seemed to be a scuffle . He cracked one eye open . The two stood at some distance from him in the big living room . They were n't fighting . Charles had her in his arms and was crushing her to him , laughing unrestrainedly . A moment later she had wriggled away . Sam closed his eyes to rest them . There was a sharp whistle , a thud and a grunt . A moment passed , then a second thud , which stirred some memory and made Sam 's head pump with pain . Charles let out a yell and an oath combined . In Sam 's groggy mind came the realization that the man was being flogged with his own whip . " Damn you ! Damn you , you filthy slut ! " Charles was up again , Sam saw , getting a cautious eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thudded again . The next instant the man had closed in and was struggling to gain possession of the weapon . He got it ; in another second he was belaboring the woman , both hands on the whip handle , and both were laughing hysterically . Sam watched in horror and fascination . Never before had he seen a flagellation , though he had read about them , among the annals of Nazi sadism . The real thing , groggy as he was , surpassed anything he had ever conceived for downright brutality and insanity . The pair of them were not trying to kill each other but had gone into a sex orgy . Up and down the room they went , knocking over a chair , upsetting a lamp , Kara screaming with a kind of harpie laughter all the while . After a time they were exhausted and stood looking at each other . Her arms were streaked with blood , her hair was flying and her clothes were torn . Charles had come through  | little better . His shirt was off and a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite hip . " We 'd better stop , darling , " Kara panted . " We 'll wake the guest . If you have n't killed him . " They both looked over toward the sofa where Sam was lying . He pulled his eyes shut and made out to be unconscious . There was a lull . The next sound he heard was an angry yowl from one of the Siamese , and he got his eye open in time to see the cat rolling over and over across the floor . Evidently Charles had kicked it , for he was laughing again . " Now that , " the woman cried , " I will not have ! " And she went for Charles again so ferociously that she got the whip away from him and began belaboring him and shouting with laughter at the same time , so that in a minute some of the people from the back of the house came running to see what was the matter . What they saw was an unleashed fury , the end of which would undoubtedly be death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his elbow to view this stunning spectacle , when Storm rushed into the room , bellowing . His left shoulder was swathed in bandages and his arm was in a sling . But this did not hinder him from hurling himself between the combatants . He threw Kara aside and jerked Charles to a standing position with his good arm . " Are you insane ? Beating your own people ! If I report on this you will both end up in Siberia ! " Kara retired down the room , threw herself on the white rug and took the injured cat in her arms . Charles brushed himself off and tucked in what was left of his shirt . Sam , the troublemaker , called out , " You came in too soon , Storm . They were just going to kill each other . Too bad they did n't . " Storm turned to him angrily . " Keep out of this ! " Then he saw that the scientist was n't too sound himself . " So he got you , too . Well , well ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though his head ached abominably . " And I got you , it seems . I told you we were at war . "  | " Lucky you did n't kill me , " the Icelander growled . " I would have , but I 'm out of practice . Wrong weapon , I guess . " " What did you hit me with ? " " A piece of your damned lighthouse . You know , the one you signal the fishing fleet with . " Charles had moved toward the group of menials and now clapped his hands sharply . " Now , all of you , clear out . The excitement is over ! " Storm stiffened and came up straight . " You too , " Charles ordered with a quick jerk of his head . Storm obeyed . As for Kara , she stood near Sam , smiling her chilly smile across at Charles , then seated herself on the arm of the sofa close to his head , and stroked his hair . The unwounded Siamese had taken up its position on the other arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them steadily . Sam shuddered . Even this animal was his enemy . Who could tell what form of spying the creature had been taught to do in this sadistic prison ? " Quite a rough young man we have here , Charles , " she said banteringly . " They will use him well , I 'm sure . If you do n't kill him first . " Charles only grunted . " Was it the whip ? " Sam asked . " I went out like a light . " " It 's a versatile tool , " Kara answered admiringly . " For pleasure , for discipline , for death . Better than a glass lens . As you see , Dr. Bowden , you bungled your job . Dislocated shoulder , bruises , a sprained back . " She shrugged . " They will eventually train you to be more efficient . " Charles interposed . " Enough of this about killing , " he scolded Kara . " The man is supposed to be delivered intact . They want him alive and well . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if harmlessly , in the air . " Now , Bowden , I have something to say to you . " " Say away , Commissar , " Sam mocked him . " First of all , there will be no more of this nonsense . None . You have been here less than a day , yet you have raised hell  | with all of us . We have no intention of indulging your fancy for murder any further . You began as a gentleman . If you do not want us to put you under long-range sedatives , go back to it . " " Sounds dull , " Sam said brightly . " You people began as gentlemen , too  --  and ladies . I was only following your example . If you treat me decently I 'll see what I can do to favor you , but I ca n't guarantee anything . " " You 'd better ! " Charles turned away . " See that he gets to his room , Kara , and that he is watched . " He strode across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's head . " Feel better , Sam ? " Sam groaned . " If I do it 's because I seem to have thrown you off balance , " he told her frankly . " I think I 'll keep it up . " " I do n't advise you to , my dear . Charles wo n't molest you again if you do n't force him to . You must realize we 're not bad people . " Sam sat up and tried to get his feet on the floor . " I do n't think , " he admitted ruefully , " that I 'll be much of a threat for a while . Ouch ! " Everything about him seemed to be out of joint ; every movement was excruciatingly painful . He sank back on the sofa and Kara brought him a generous glass of brandy , which he drank down as if it were water . The fiery stuff revived him almost at once , and he felt his defenses returning . Kara was close to him again . " Oh , Sam , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being abusive . If only you could accept the fact that a new life is beginning for you . I could like you a lot ? " She leaned over quickly and kissed him on the cheek . " Philip is going away this afternoon and will be gone for several days . Thanks to your poor aim with that glass , he can . If you will only be yourself , my dear , we can have something lovely together . " He regarded her stolidly . He knew what she meant and what he feared now was that he would not have the ingenu- ity to escape her . Kara , he divined , was no tyro . He watched her as she turned and stroked the cat , then spoke to it as if it were a person . " Nikita , darling , stay here exactly where you are . Watch this young man . Mind , now . I will be back in a few minutes . " The cat waved the tip of its tail ; otherwise it sat without moving . Kara patted his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they would leave him alone for a while . But he had scarcely sunk back and shut his eyes when Storm returned . He seemed in a hurry . " Sam , I came in to tell you that I will be away for a day or two , and to urge you to do nothing that will anger Charles . He is on edge , naturally , and will easily do you some harm if you misbehave . He has no motive of past friendship as I have . " " You are incredible , Philip , " Sam said . " You really do think you can be a friend and a traitor at the same time . " " Of course I do . Do n't be stupid , my boy . That 's the basis of our drive toward victory . We often lie to you , betray you , but never do we do so to ourselves . Our objective is clear always . You lie , too , and your principal lie is that you do n't lie . And you have no objective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that 's beside the point now . I 'll be bringing back a friend of yours  --  Dennerson . Princeton . Remember him ? " " My God ! " Sam sat up . " Dr. Dennerson ? You ca n't go off with a man like that . You 'd be insane to try . " " We already have him . I 'm merely to furnish final transportation . Wo n't take long , and we may bring back still another of the team . " " You 've thought , of course , " Sam interposed , fishing in his pocket for his pipe , " that the more of us you grab the more our people will be alerted . If you were as smart as you think you are , Storm , you 'd settle for just me as a start . " " I 'm afraid you are wrong , Sam . There are those in your State Department who know about this project and approve it .  | This stunning news struck the scientist silent . Betrayal . How widespread it had become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't believe it . " But Storm would not accept the repudiation . He joshed him briefly , gave him a playful shake and an admonition to be good , and was gone . Sam stared after him . These people had a strange faith in their own rightness . They were never long discouraged . Would that America could boast as much ! His thoughts turned somberly to Dennerson . If he had really been taken it meant that the operation was a big one , no doubt had high priority and would be put through without delay . He did not question that it must have some support within the American government . And if it had , what possible chance had any mere citizen like himself , ever to get free ? His own work in the many secret categories of the defense effort had taught him that there was ample room for such subversion , and that no one in Washington , in some twenty years ' time , had ever been able to stop it , or even to get the country to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somehow , the capture of his old teacher , James Dennerson , put a new face on the whole thing . They were caught in something really big . He feared very much that they were to be regarded as expendable . He sighed . Perhaps things would look brighter if he had a little rest . He lay back and was asleep almost at once . He was awakened by a cool hand on his brow . It was a pleasant hand and he lay for a minute with eyes closed , enjoying the sensation . What was the use of resisting Kara any further ? If there was to be no return what did it matter ? Apparently Kara wanted it . Why should he hold out ? He opened his eyes , with a weak smile . It was the girl Hanni Kirsch , kneeling down beside him . His body tightened and he withdrew himself . " And now , you ! " he grumbled . " I 'm so sorry , Dr. Bowden , " she whispered . " These brutes ! I hope you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned wearily . " I 'm not , I guess . But I 'd do  | better if you would leave me alone . There 's nothing for you to contribute . " She stroked his brow in silence for a time . " You do n't mean that . " He was trying to sleep again , to get away from her . " Indeed I do . Just more tricks . I 'm tired of tricks , " he murmured sleepily . She shook his shoulder . " Please do n't fall asleep . There 's only a minute for me to talk . Whether you believe it or not we 're both prisoners . I 'm to be the technician to go with your team when we get to Russia . Kara told me . They 're going to take us away in a ship in a day or two , as soon as the others are brought here . We 've got to escape ! " He chuckled cynically . " We ca n't . I ca n't , anyway . Have n't the strength to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will ! And I 've got a plan to do it . If you 'll only listen ! " " Better not mention it in front of that cat . It will go and tell Kara . " But she seized both his arms , really shaking him so that it hurt him . " Dr. Bowden ! Pay attention ! I know you 're not yourself . But listen ! " She was speaking rapidly . Well-rehearsed , probably , he thought . Why did they want to keep torturing him with false leads to escape ? Brainwashing , probably . Softening up technique . She was going on hurriedly . " I know where they have hidden the oars to that boat . I hunted till I found them under the porch . Tonight after dark we can get away ! " She looked at him pleadingly . He noticed for the first time how honest and open her face looked , in contrast to Kara 's . And how pleasant , especially in the flush of excitement . Why does she have to belong to them , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you do n't want to do it for yourself , do it for me . Do you think I want to be tortured and raped ? "  | " You want me to be noble , is that it ? " he retorted . " No , Miss Kirsch , it 's no go . You ca n't trick me that way . I happen to know the oars are in the boat . " " They 're not in the boat , " she insisted angrily . " Charles brought them back while you were out with that big redheaded thug . " Suddenly they both noticed that the cat , which had been sitting on the further sofa arm staring at them , had ceased to , and was on its way out of the room , trotting purposefully . " See what I mean ? The damn thing was listening . It 's gone to inform on us . " " That 's not very logical , is it ? If I 'm what you think I am ? " she said . " If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , not tell on me . " He laughed . " Scientific logic , huh ? Well , you people know how to twist that all up , too . I 'm too tired to figure it out now . " Kara came quickly into the room , followed by the cat . " Is she annoying you , Sam ? " she said with apparent earnestness . " Miss Kirsch , that will do ! I think you had both better go to your rooms now and get ready for dinner . You have time to lie down for a few minutes , Sam , if you feel tired . " The girl eyed her , shrugged , and took herself wearily out of the room . It was some minutes before Sam found the strength to stand up , and then only with Kara 's help . She left him at the top of the stairs and he made it to his room alone . How hopeless it was to extricate himself from the web he had blundered into ! If they had been simple gangsters , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would be all right . He could defy them , outwit them . But this  --  this devious , clever combination of threat with artful surrender  --  the celebrated two steps forward and one step back  --  how could you disentangle yourself from it ? He threw himself on his bed and wished , miserably , that it were all a dream .  | DINNER was over , finally , and Sam was thankful . It had been an ordeal of silence , broken by sly conversational probes by Kara which nobody answered . Charles and the Kirsch girl were there ; Storm had gone . It was Sam 's hope to escape on the excuse of extreme fatigue , but Kara had detained him . Charles had left immediately and the girl had soon followed , realizing she was no match for the Russian woman . Kara ensconced herself on the sofa and drew up her legs . To his misfortune , Sam had to admit that they were good legs ; from the depths of his inexperience , he judged , very good legs . He wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enticing body , and instantly berated himself for the thought . " I 'm pretty tired , " he said , hoping for an escape route while there was still time . She merely smiled up at him as he stood over her and he found himself beside her on the sofa , with her hand in his .  | " It 's nice Philip is n't here . Just you and me . " She looked into the fire , her head turned away from him so that the perfume she had dabbed on her neck could do its work . " I do n't see you alone very often . " " Why should you want to ? " She turned toward him languidly . " But I do want to ! I 've wanted to from the minute I first saw you in the boathouse . You 're so straight and honest  --  oh , and decent . The men I know are n't that way at all . Look at Charles  --  what a brute he is . " Sam considered this . It made no sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a backwoodsman , an oaf , a betrayer , even of his own associates . It would serve him right if we  --  besides , he would never know . " He kept his silence . She added , " it would be a good revenge for you . He treated you pretty shabbily , you know . " Sam sighed . More than anything else , just now , he needed Miss Burton , back at the Lab . Someone to mother him and tell him what to do with this woman . Miss Burton would know , homely and unexciting as she was . She always knew the way out of his problems . He was strangely lonely for her and the sense of protection she gave . Would he ever see her again ? Or any of the people and scenes that were his life ? Without knowing quite what had happened , he found himself leaning his weary head on Kara 's shoulder , and she was stroking his cheek with a hand he found soft and comforting . They listened to the crackling of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two cats , which had been curled up on the white rug , rose and stretched its black paws carefully , then seated itself and stared at him malevolently . " Go away , Nikita , " Kara said sharply . " I do n't need you now . " But the cat did not go away . It just sat there and stared . Sam could not help a gleeful rejoinder . " It is n't quite trained enough , is it ? " he said , thoughtfully . " It makes the  | mistake of thinking I am threatening you instead of you threatening me . " " Sam , stop talking nonsense ! " she admonished him , snuggling closer . But the little by-play had broken the spell . Sam stood up abruptly . " I 'm sorry , Kara . I think I 'll go to bed . " " All right , my dear , " she returned softly . " There 's no hurry . No hurry at all . Rest well . " She watched him with veiled eyes as he stumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was drenched with sweat . He did not go directly to bed but paced the bare little room , thinking of the invitation he had just turned down . Doubts assailed him . She was common property here , so there was nothing to deter him on that score . What had he to lose ? Perhaps she had no ulterior motive at all . Perhaps she was just lonely , in the midst of all this intrigue , craving protection . Perhaps he was attractive to her , as she said . Why not go back down there and let it happen ? What did it matter now , anyway ? His life was over . Sam stared out of the window . A battered moon was just rising over the sea , a huge gargoyle in the mist . It seemed to be laughing at him and challenging him to take what he wanted . He did want it , he knew that . He turned and strode to the door and reached for the knob . But it turned of itself . Ah ! he thought . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The far-away voice of Amelia Burton seemed to be saying , " Sam ! Sam ! " , but he did not listen to it . She came in quickly and closed the door behind her . She was dressed in a diaphanous negligee and her hair formed a halo around her head that caught the light from the wall lamp behind her and made her contours very beautiful . He advanced to get a better look at her . It was not Kara at all , but Johanna Kirsch . " What do you want ? " he stammered . " Sam , oh Sam ! " She threw herself into his arms . He seized her by the wrists and held her at arm 's length . " Miss Kirsch , what is this ? What are you trying to prove ? " he blundered  | inanely . " I was just going to bed , " he lied hurriedly . With women , panic was not far behind for Sam at any time . It was in dangerous control now . For some reason he was horrified that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed obviously for an encounter . He dropped her wrists and moved back . She stood looking at him , crestfallen . The light behind her shone through the edges of her gown in a way to make her look as if she had an aura . He wondered how he had been able to ignore her all day . " I came , " she said rather pitifully , " to get ahead of her . " " You what ? Miss Kirsch ? " " You might as well call me Hanni now . We are n't exactly on formal terms any more . " She tried to smile . " Hanni . " He liked the name on his tongue . It was endearing , yet it had strength and character . " I thought  --  if she  --  if you  --  if you fell for her it would be too late . Then you would never try to escape . So I ? " she gulped . " Oh , Sam , " she went on passionately , " I had to do something to make you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll ? I 'll do anything to make you see that . " He stood looking at her for a long time . " I do n't know , " he said finally . " I do n't know . I have nothing against you personally , but you ca n't blame me for being suspicious . After all , everybody I believed in here has betrayed me . I would be a fool to trust anybody . And all this routine about escapes is getting kind of silly . " She had wrapped her gown tightly around her . " Then I 've failed , " she said in a small voice . " I knew I would . I want you to believe one thing , Dr. Bowden ? " " Sam , was n't it ? " " ? Sam . I 've never done such a thing as this before . I never would have now if I had n't been desperate . If I had n't thought I could make you see . I 'm not like Kara . " He said , slowly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be like Kara. "  | She hung her head . " But you can like Kara . You can want her ? " It was his turn to be ashamed . " I suppose so . I do n't know . Men are different , I guess . " " Yes . Men are different . But they are such babies , such ? Sam ! " Her voice was suddenly vibrant and strong . " Do n't let her win ! She will destroy you , ca n't you see ? She 's part of the plot ! Worse than Storm , worse than Charles . She is their special lure for men like you . They trained her for this over there in those schools for subversion  --  I know it  --  she 's been taught every move . She knows how to be hard to get , how to attract your attention with her little glances and the way she moves . Her cats , too . They 're part of it . You wo n't believe that , but they are . I 've studied about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her the cats over there and trained them for her . Part of an act . To make you hate her and despise her and yet to fascinate you like Circe in the Greek myth . Sam ! Sam ! You were wonderful when you came . You were angry and aroused and you were going to fight . You tried to escape the first thing . They let you try . They knew just when to stop you , too , and soften you with the whip . Now they leave you alone with her until she succeeds . That 's why I came to you tonight  --  to warn you , to beg you to keep away from her . " She stopped and regarded him wistfully . " I was foolish , " she finally said , " to think I could be a match for her . " And when Sam still did n't say anything , she added , " I 'm not making sense , am I ? You just think I 'm being catty and jealous  --  trying to steal her act . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know . I do n't know what to think . " Then he looked at her more with his heart than his head and he was aware that she could not possibly be like Kara , or like the rest of them , or be one of them . Or anything but herself , a very frightened and earnest girl . And perversely this made him embarrassed , and she saw it and understood what had happened to him . " I 'll go now , "  | she said softly , and turned to the door . He stood there and let her go , immobilized by a lifetime of self-doubt about women . " Hanni , " he said softly to himself . It was a beautiful name . He lay awake for a long time , trying to make himself believe that this was just one more dirty trick they had rigged up for him . But his mind would n't accept it . The soft sound of her voice , the pleading in her brown eyes , the aura of light around her body  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , caring very much . It came to him that she had made a sacrifice to come into his room that way , that she was not a girl who would do a thing like that normally , but that she had been willing to take this desperate chance to impress him , in order to make him understand . And he realized , too , that she had done this because she had trusted him , and had known what he would do . He fell asleep feeling very bewildered and very happy indeed . It was a brilliant northwest day and he woke well rested . His head was clear . At first he did not know why everything seemed right again . Then he thought of Hanni . That explained it . He would see her and tell her that he believed in her . Meanwhile , to action ! This was the day that he must do something decisive . It was Tuesday , he realized . The Air Force meeting had been yesterday . By now they would be looking for him . If he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to get word to them . He found himself left entirely alone . Neither Charles nor Kara nor Hanni were in sight in the dining room or afterward . After a solitary breakfast he wandered over the island and found it a barren knob of rock and pine in an endless sea . In no direction could he see land . Storm had not been lying . The little airport was on the west side , but it had no control tower and only one small hangar . He walked the path around the island and saw the wharf he had come upon . But the big boat he had discovered was not there . There was no radio  | anywhere , nor any sign of an aerial on the house roof . If they communicated from here the equipment must be in the attic or the hangar . The small outbuildings , he saw , were only woodsheds and storage . He felt he was being watched ; it was a bad time to snoop . Besides , Hanni 's idea of an attempt to escape by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As he returned to his room he stopped and tapped very lightly on her door . There was no sound inside , but presently she opened it a crack . " Sam ! " There was joy in the word as she whispered it . He put his hand over hers on the door frame . " I ca n't talk now . But listen . Meet me at the boat at nine tonight . Wear warm clothes . I will bring the oars . " " Oh , Sam ! " " Do n't pay any attention to me the rest of the day . Under-stand ? " She was breathless . " I understand and it 's wonderful ! " The door closed softly , and he moved away . He faced now his hardest problem : how to act as if he were not acting at all , but had given up , discouraged , beaten . And yet how not to overdo it . He wished he had been interested in theatricals , or even debating  --  anything to do with affecting an audience . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect on others , but only the effect of his ideas . They must n't know that he was plotting . The dining room was empty again at lunchtime , though an excellent cold meal was set out on the sideboard . Hanni took care not to be there . Charles came in late , wolfed a sandwich and went off again , scarcely speaking to him . Kara stayed away . There was something thoroughly disquieting about their all avoiding him . Any minute he expected to be seized and locked up somewhere , perhaps in the lighthouse , thus ending his brave plan . There was a bookcase in the living room . He forced himself to sit and read there after lunch . It seemed the most innocuous thing to do . Finally , he went back upstairs to rest for the night 's work . He could n't rest  | and prowled about the room on edge , expecting a knock on the door any minute . He looked out into the hall , wondering if now might be a safe time to sneak up into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a maroon dressing gown came out of the bathroom and disappeared into a room a few doors away . By the shuffling gait and the fact that the man steadied himself with a hand on the wall , Sam judged he must be the mysterious character who Storm had said owned the place . On an impulse he followed the old man , waited a moment , and then tapped on his door . He might as well find out what he could of this member of the conspiracy . " What do you want now ? " a petulant voice came from within . Rather than speak aloud in the hall , Sam turned the knob and went in , closing the door quickly behind him . The old man stood near the bed , scowling at the intrusion . He was in his seventies , with white hair and a deeply lined face that must once have been strong . He had on a huge turtle-neck sweater that had once been white ; the open dressing gown was unkempt . One of his slippers had worn through at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not help staring at him , he was so different from what he had expected of the owner . Yet he saw that the face held distinction . He had been somebody once , that was plain , but was not so any longer . The room was on the land side of the house and the northwest wind made it cold and bleak . It was a large apartment , no doubt the master bedroom  --  impossibly ornate but pathetically down at the heel . There was a fireplace but the fire had gone out . " Are you Mr. Tanner ? " " What if I am ? " The old man examined him with hostility . " You ca n't get anything out of me . Go away . " " May I talk to you ? " Sam asked , smiling reassuringly . " I know who you are and I have nothing to say , young man , " he retorted fussily . " I do n't like intruders . "  | " I only wanted to pay my respects , since you are my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cackled . " Nobody has any respect for me any more . I am just excess baggage here . They 'll do away with me , no doubt , before long . " He reached behind him to locate the bed and sat down on it . It had not been made . A tray of dirty dishes slid off the pillow as he depressed the mattress . Sam caught it in the nick of time , lifting it onto the cluttered bureau . The man watched him , breathing noisily . " You 're the young curmudgeon who nearly did for Storm yesterday . " He guffawed with sudden vehemence . " Too bad you missed . I do n't like Storm . But I still do n't want to talk to you . They might find out . " The moment was awkward and Sam did not know whether to go or stay . To fill in , he went to the fireplace and laid in a new log and some kindling , then set it alight . " You 'll be warmer now , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon enough , when I start burning in hell . " " You must n't say that . " " I 'll say what I like . I can still do that . I used to give them orders because I paid the bills . Then they began telling me . Now they do n't even do that . They leave me here to rot . " Sam made the plunge . " Are you the head of all this ? " The old man cackled again . " It 's my island and my house and my money . But that 's all . This gangster they call Charles ? " " I 'm afraid I do n't follow you . " Sam was interested . There was something here that might help him . This old fellow was a captive like himself , but of a different kind . He 'd do well to find out about him . " Would you like to tell me ? " " No . It bores me to talk about it . " But he was regarding the younger man with interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't bend over to do it . " " Do n't they keep it going for you ? " " They do not . They leave me here alone . They do n't want my help any more . Well , I 'm glad they do n't . They 're up to  | something . I do n't know what . The girl came first , and now you . They signal to Russian ships all the time from that lighthouse they built . " " Storm took me there yesterday . That 's where I hit him . " " Yes , I know . You hit him with a piece of lens . You were a fool to miss . " " I tried not to , " Sam said . " That 's not good enough with these people . You only get one try . " He sat on the bed looking at his feet . " I learned that . Once I could tell them what to do , here in America . I paid for their meetings and gave them advertising and ? finally this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They said it was for meetings . But it turned out to be a base for their fishing fleet . I could have raised hell about that . It 's in U.S. waters . I could have told the government . I was a fool not to . " " Where is the island ? " Sam asked eagerly . " Mouth of Penobscot Bay , way out . That 's why I bought it . To live alone . " He hooted . " Now they 've got me prisoner . " " Surely you knew they would discard you as soon as they did n't need you . They 're not playing games . " The old man sighed . " Idealists are fools , young man . I thought I was saving the world . " Sam found a chair and pulled it close to the bed . " I wish you 'd tell me what you can . I 'm trying to get away . How did you know about the lighthouse ? " The old man considered , chuckling to himself . " I still have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 've got him under their thumb , but he keeps me posted . " " Why does n't he go to the mainland to get help ? " " You 're crazy . Nobody goes anywhere unless they say so . Ben makes out he is working for them and they let him stay . " His eyes wandered around the room for a moment . " But they do n't let him do for me any more . Just bring my food , that 's all . Pretty soon they 'll start starving me. "  | " But you must have friends , associates , people ashore who would get curious when they did n't hear from you . " " Precious few any more ! I was a Red sympathizer and people dropped me one by one . Plenty besides me followed the same line  --  peace at any price , no more war , universal brotherhood , communist utopia  --  all that rot . But they ca n't help me . They still think all this stuff is wonderful . I 've learned better . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And we suckers are paying for it . They got my money  --  all of it . " " But  --  you can just stop paying , ca n't you ? " " No . I was a fool . I backed them . I endowed a foundation to help peace and they got control of it . The foundation 's irrevocable . Millions , to save the world from bombing . It has n't saved a thing . It wo n't . It will just go on till they get ready to take over . " Sam sat waiting for him to continue . The old man searched his face . " You look like a decent young fellow , " he said . " How did they get you here ? " Sam told him about the affair at Keezar Lake and Tomhagen Pond . Tanner grunted . " Storm . He 's a bad one . " Without much urging he went on . " He 's not a communist ; he 's worse . He 's a sympathizer , a traitor . I gave that big snake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my factories . White-haired boy with a red beard and a black heart . The Edward Tanner Industries , " he said sadly , " and I made him my right hand man . All the time he was a spy and I did n't know it . I thought he was an idealist , like me . They sent him over here to learn about America , become an American , work his way into a position of trust . " He laughed bitterly . " He did it all right . " " I can believe it . " " Maybe you wo n't believe me , " Tanner said plaintively , " but I 'm a good American , a good citizen . Or I was . I built up a fortune and gave the country wealth and progress and thousands of people jobs . Storm among them . And all the while he was learning , getting set to betray his adopted  | country , and me . Finally he left me and got work with the government . I gave him a clean bill of health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of line . The spies call it a " cover " ? a false front . His was perfect . When I retired I bought this island and came out here to live . I liked it alone . But I was n't alone long . Storm came out here and persuaded me to let him use it for his friends . Friends ! " The disgust and bitterness in the word knifed through the room . Sam stared at him . The whole betrayal was plain to him now . " I 've told you all I 'm going to tell you , " Tanner said , sinking back on the pillow . " Now you go . And do n't say you talked to me , and do n't try to find out who Ben is or get him to take word ashore . He would be killed and so would I. Besides , I 'm going to die pretty soon anyway and I need his help for that . " He closed his eyes and Sam realized that he was dismissed . He crossed quietly to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he paused . " Thank you , Mr. Tanner , for being an honest and decent American . I wo n't forget you . And maybe I can help you . I hope I can . " He went out quietly and returned to his own room , the sadder and richer for the experience .  | THE REST of the day dragged interminably . He checked the oars and they were under the porch , where Hanni had said . In fact , they were hardly hidden at all . Careless of Charles , he thought , but he supposed the man was now so arrogantly sure of himself that he did n't bother . At dinner , where they were all assembled , he had a new ordeal . What had he done all day , Kara wanted to know ? He told the truth , or part of it . He had read a book mostly , and described it in detail enough to be convincing . Afterward , Kara detained him and he knew that he might have had what she was ready to give him without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't even sit down with her , and after a few inanities excused himself . She got in a parting shot : " You prefer Miss Kirsch to me , I 'm afraid , Sam , " she said innocently . He froze , with his eyes averted and chose a lie . " I am in- terested in neither of you , Kara . I hope you 'll believe me . I am very much in love with someone back home . " " Does that really matter now ? " she asked . " It matters to me , " he told her and left the room . It was an agonizing time he spent upstairs , waiting for what he judged to be an hour to go by . He had no watch , of course , and no clock . But he had checked the one on the living room mantel and knew that he had come up at eight . He ransacked his bag and dug out extra underwear , which he pulled on , topping it with a heavy shirt and old sweater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mildness of an October night at sea . It would be bitterly cold . So eager was he to be off that he nearly forgot his papers  --  the notebook , identification cards and a few letters  --  but he got these and said a regretful good bye to his decent clothes and toilet articles . He would never see them again , he thought exultantly . He wished he had a bottle of liquor . It might save them if they had to drift for long hours . It was possible he might steal some from the sideboard downstairs , but he did not dare risk it . He had nothing but a bottle of aspirin and put that in his pocket anyway , along with his pipe and what tobacco he had . Then he eased up the window and slipped out onto the roof , closing the sash after him . In a minute he was on the ground below , had found the oars and was on his way along the path . He glanced back once and saw several lights in the upper rooms . Kara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in his ; his window was on the other side . He guessed that they did n't know what he was up to , any of them . It gave him a little-boy feeling of playing hookey , and he would have whistled if he had let himself . Better not , though . No telling who might be around to be attracted by whistling in the dark . The phrase amused his sense of the droll . " What else have I got to whistle in ? " he asked himself with a chuckle . He was really feeling fine .  | The night was very dark . The moon , he knew , would n't be up before midnight , which was ideal . He would n't need it till then . He took his time on the path , being careful not to bang the oars on anything and thus raise the alarm . The stealth of it delighted him . It was really so easy to fool human beings , especially when they were overconfident . He found the boat , his eyes now well adapted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaped up , throwing her arms around him . " Oh , Sam ! " His diffidence overcame him . " Let 's get her into the water , " he said . They launched the little dory and let her ride on the smooth water off the beach . Not a sound came from the shore . They had got away with it . The rest was just hard work . Sam settled down to the task , pulling long , clean strokes and being careful not to let the oars rattle in the rowlocks . She sat in the stern and she was humming a little tune . " I knew you could do it , " she said admiringly . He leaned over and felt of her arms . She did not have on very much and he was worried . " Here , " he directed . " You row . It will keep you warm . " He was relieved to see that she knew how to do it . She was quite a girl . They were out of the lee of the island now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ahead toward what he hoped would be a not-too-distant shore . The motion was quite pleasant . The small dory behaved like a veteran . New England had not pinned its faith on the dory 's remarkable design for nothing . It was fast , safe , and eminently seaworthy . After a while she rested on the oars and took a deep breath . " What a beautiful night , " she said , enraptured . " Row ! " he urged , " and do n't stop ! " She began , trying bravely , but her strength was not sufficient . Soon she had stopped again .  | " My dear girl , " he said severely . " You are sitting there half dressed , and the temperature out here is close to freezing . If you do n't exercise and keep your blood going you 'll come down with pneumonia . " She laughed charmingly . " Yes , sir , " she said , and began pulling again . A few minutes later he whispered , suddenly , " Stop ! listen ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then over the surface of the water came a heavy rumble from the direction of the island . " They have a big boat , " he said . " They may have discovered that we got away . " They waited a few minutes more . The rumble had increased now to a roar . There was no doubt the boat was coming after them . " What can we do ? " she cried . He seized the oars and laid them in the boat . " Here , get down in the bottom . Quick ! " They lay side by side while the boat drifted . Sam crawled to the stern and lifted his head just enough to see . " They 're coming after us , all right . " " Oh , Sam , no ! " " They are . They 've got a searchlight on now . I guess we 've had it . " She was whimpering . " They ca n't . They must n't ! " " Well , we tried . We  --  Hanni ! Did you tell them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had sat up , too . " Because if you did , " he said slowly , " that means I was right after all . " " You ca n't believe that . " " Wait ! " he whispered suddenly . " They 've turned . They 're not headed this way now . " They were both up , watching . The motor craft was no more than a quarter of a mile away , but it was headed to the west . " It 's a pretty big ocean , " he said hopefully . " Maybe they wo n't find us after all . " Just then a blaze of light struck them . They were in the full glare of the searchlight . " Do n't move a muscle , " he commanded . " Sit still ! "  | The light swept on past them and did not come back again . They waited for a few minutes more . He got up and took the oars . " That was close , " he said . " But I think we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You must believe in me , Sam , " she begged . " I did n't tell them . " He picked up the oars and started rowing again . " Then how did they know ? " " Perhaps they do this every night , just in case . It was not very convincing . Suddenly she began pouring forth her story , headlong , and with such sincerity that he found himself believing it . She had worked in one of the government laboratories in Washington that Storm frequented . She was a radiation specialist and engaged in independent research that was important . One day Charles had turned up and Storm had introduced him as a member of the Polish underground gathering support for the anti-communist cause in the United States . For some days he had returned frequently and she , being lonely and impressed by his rank , had let him take her out . Charles had been the soul of courtesy and meticulous about making no passes at her at all . " I  --  I guess I wondered why he did n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something the matter with me . " One Sunday , she related , Storm had suggested that they borrow his Defense Department plane for an outing . She agreed , and they had had a wonderful day , flying over Washington , then going out to the Shenandoah Valley . After that , Charles took her in the plane often and she even wondered , finally , if he might not ask her to marry him . " The rest was easy , " she finished woodenly . " One afternoon we just did n't come back . " She had been on the island two weeks before Sam had come , and had tried desperately to get away . There had been only one chance , she said : a fishing boat that came to the island once a week to supply them . She had managed to be on the wharf on its second visit and had tried her best to attract the attention of a tall , thin native who ran the boat .               @ @ @ @ @ @
