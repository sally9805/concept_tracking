Ho Chi Minh is irreplaceable-as his admirers and enemies alike will agree-but he must now be replaced . At week 's end , Hanoi Radio announced that a collective leadership " selected and well-trained " by Ho would rule the country , at least for a while . Its members were not named , but these four men are almost certain to be among them : PHAM VAN DONG , the Premier . He was closer to Ho than anyone , although that will not necessarily help him succeed his mentor . Ho called him " my best pupil " and " my other self . " Dong 's striking face was once compared to " a mask carved for a museum of the revolution , in order to show just how far the peoples of Asia are capable of carrying stoicism . " Dong once told a French visitor : " We Communists are romantics , too . You do n't know how exciting it is to make a revolution .

After France 's defeat , he led the triumphant guerrilla delegation to the 1954 Geneva talks , becoming Premier the following year . Just as Ho steered an even course between China and Russia , so in all likelihood would Dong . <P> LE DUAN , the party chief . Though he is First Secretary of the Hanoi party and was second only to Ho in the Vietnamese Communist hierarchy , he is little known in the West . Nikita Khrushchev once said Le Duan ( pronounced Lay Zwan ) " talks , thinks and acts like a Chinese , " but he is believed to be neutral , or even mildly inclined toward Moscow , in the Sino-Soviet dispute . Imprisoned for ten years by the French , he began his career late but climbed fast . When the country was divided in 1954 , Hanoi withdrew its crack troops from the South but assigned Le Duan there to prepare politically for a second round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Viet Cong proved , that in 1956 <P> Ho gave him the job of running the whole party . Le Duan also organized the Liberation Front , the Viet Cong 's political structure now represented at the Paris talks . <P> TRUONG CHINH , the leading theoretician . Chinh , Chairman of Hanoi 's National Assembly , is as openly pro-Peking as any leader can be in a traditionally anti-Chinese country . He has provided his own political label : his adopted name means " Long March , " after Mao Tse-tung 's epic 7,000-mile trek to sanctuary in Yenan in 1934 . Chinh may be too far out on Peking 's political limb to head up Hanoi 's middle-of-the-road leadership . Moreover , he has been at odds with both Le Duan and General Giap . With Ho gone as a mediating force , Chinh could find himself isolated by his enemies-unless he manages to isolate them first .
