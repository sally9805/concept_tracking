The largest American campaign of the Viet Nam war raged last week in the thick jungle of Tay Ninh province northwest of Saigon . Some 16,000 U.S. troops traded blows with an elusive Communist enemy that remained mostly hidden in his forest fastness , emerging occasionally to do vicious , bloody battle . So far , most of the blood was Red . In a week of fighting , more than 900 Viet Cong died . <P> As so often happens , the battle , code-named Operation Attleboro , got its start with a minor fire fight . A U.S. company on a routine rice hunt stumbled onto a Viet Cong platoon and traded blows for an hour . But that night the enemy struck back , mortaring two base camps -a tactic sometimes used by the Communists to divert the Allies from more serious business near by . Still not certain if something big was up , U.S. commanders dispatched six battalions of the 1st Infantry Division to the scene by plane and helicopter . <P> Eight Hours of Lead . Things became a lot more certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 400 of his riflemen through the Tay Ninh jungles when , as he put it , " all hell broke loose . " An ambush of 1,500 Communist soldiers opened up with automatic rifles and machine guns on the Americans-and kept on firing and firing . " For eight hours it was nothing but solid lead , " said Meloy later . " Where the V.C. got all the ammunition , I 've got no earthly idea . " Six times the Red soldiers launched human wave charges , yelling and screaming above the crackle of bullets . Meloy 's men held them off until reinforcements arrived , permitting a U.S. withdrawal under pinpoint artillery cover , but three of his companies took heavy casualties in the encounter . But so did the enemy : in some 30 hours of intermittent battle , Meloy , his command eventually grown to eleven companies , accounted for some 200 Red dead . <P> Meloy 's ordeal triggered the massive infusion of men into the battle . Operation Attleboro had begun as a routine operation a month ago , with elements of the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Division units and the 173rd Airborne Brigade were brought up . Major General William E. DePuy , commander of the 1st Division , took charge of Attleboro and set up an operational headquarters at Dau Tieng . The once-sleepy village bordering a large rubber plantation soon resembled a World War II beachhead as lumbering C-1235 transports and darting helicopters brought in hundreds of tons of supplies from 175-mm. artillery shells to plastic bottles of mosquito repellent . DePuy soon concluded that Attleboro had caught the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese massing for an attack on the Special Forces camp of Suoi Da , perhaps as the opening of a major winter offensive . True or not , the Reds kept fighting as though it were ; the biggest battle was still to come .
