If anyone had any doubt left that the sprawling , messy Department of Agriculture needs a thorough overhauling , it was dispelled last week . Billie Sol Estes may be the farm program 's biggest bad boy to date , but it became obvious that he has plenty of company . So far . the FBI has used 452 special agents from 46 cities in its Estes investigation , at a cost of $236,200 ; congressional investigations are expected to cost another halfmillion . But scandal was piling on scandal with such regularity that the price to the taxpayer of investigating them all might yet become a scandal of sorts itself . <P> Almost Grateful . Appearing before Senator John McClellan 's Investigations Subcommittee , beleaguered Agriculture Secretary Orville Freeman seemed almost grateful for the week 's first scandal . Though there to testify about Estes , he insisted on talking about a new discovery by the Government 's General Accounting Office . In 1959 and 1960. the office had found , brokers licensed by the Agriculture Department to purchase surplus cotton for the Government and sell it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million worth to themselves-at prices as much as $20 a bale below market . Cost to the Government : between $12 million and $15 million , by Agriculture 's own estimates . Anxious to ease the Estes burden he has carried for weeks . Freeman pointed out that the scandal had taken place under the Eisenhower Administration , that his regime had stopped it , and that he was taking steps to recoup Government losses incurred by the illegal transactions . <P> As Freeman was trying to lay this burden on Republican doorsteps , another turned up in his lap : two more suspensions of minor Agriculture officials came to light . The men were office managers for the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service-the agency embroiled in Billie Sol 's fraudulent cotton-allotment dealings . They were ousted in connection with $28,000 worth of illegal rice-allotment sales in Texas ' Brazoria and Matagorda counties over the past three years . Both cotton and rice allotments are valuable , since without them farmers are subject to unprofitably stiff penalties for planting and marketing-but their sale is distinctly illegal . Smarting at the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The big question : Will the rice scandal spread across the Texas coastal rice belt ?
