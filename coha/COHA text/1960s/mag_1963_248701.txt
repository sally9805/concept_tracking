Two years have passed since Berlin was severed by the Wall . On its anniversary last week , most West Berliners heeded official appeals to refrain from violent , futile demonstrations . Instead , they observed the day quietly by placing wreaths on the dozens of crosses marking each spot where a fleeing East German had been shot to death by Com munist guards . Only late in the evening was the city 's grave calm broken by a mob of some 2,000 hell-raising West Berliners who surged into the area around Checkpoint Charlie , hurling rocks and insults across the Wall into the Soviet sector . <P> If Germans have learned to live with the Berlin Wall and the deadly , 830-mile barricade that divides the rest of their nation , on neither side have they forgotten or forgiven its existence . The most eloquent evidence of East Germans ' refusal to accept Sovietization is that 16,456 of them have risked their lives and fled to the West since the Wall went up . Among them were 1,304 members of East Germany 's army and police force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more East Germans are known to have been killed while attempting to escape . <P> Facts of Life . Despite this somber chronicle of flight and death , many politicians and pundits outside Germany still cling to the notion - based in part on deep-rooted fear of resurgent German power - that its people are gradually becoming reconciled to their coun try 's partition . In West Germany itself , this view is accepted in some quarters , mostly because it is a fact of present European life that the Russians can not be moved out of East Germany , except by war , a West German surrender to Communism , or some kind of settlement for which West Germany might have to pay a ruinous price . As a result , many Germans are beginning to ponder measures that fall , short of actual reunification-such as trade pressure-designed to persuade Communist Boss Walter Ulbricht to give East Germans a little more freedom and a somewhat better life . <P> Franz Thedieck , State Secretary for All-German Affairs , said recently : " Of course we would like to see Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East Germany the existence of one single German state would not be absolutely necessary . " Existential Philosopher Karl Jaspers created a furor by suggesting in 1960 that his countrymen must accept changes in the map of Germany as part of their liability for Hitler . Many Germans now accept his thought : " The only thing that counts is freedom . Compared with that , reunification is a matter of indifference . " <P> But the thought is largely academic , since it would be almost as difficult to liberalize the Ulbricht regime as to get the Russians out of East Germany . The Jaspers line thus may temper but does not eliminate the basic urge for reunification in a country which achieved national unity later than other European nations and is fiercely insistent on its ethnic identity . That fact is at the heart of Bonn 's opposition to any East-West agreement that would formally or psychologically seal the status quo in Germany and Europe . Says a Western ambassador in Bonn : " The issue of German unity still has more explosive potential than any other issue on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fools to underestimate it . "
