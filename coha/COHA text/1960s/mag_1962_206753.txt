SOME of Europe 's biggest business executives are on government payrolls . <P> The companies they run are , variously , monuments of socialist tradition , nationalist pride or the turbulence of the Depression and World War II . In France , state ownership of industry is estimated to be 20% or more . One lingering result of Mussolini 's corporate state is that modern Italian businessmen must operate in an economy where more than one-third of business is controlled by the government . In Germany , Hitler 's Third Reich started Volkswagen to produce his " people 's car , " but it made war vehicles instead and is still 40% state-owned . Governments control every major European airline-because every government pridefully feels it must have one , and no one else is willing to lose such money . <P> Many of these state-controlled companies are now run by boldly unique businessmen bureaucrats , whose management skills are widely and publicly admired by their free-enterprising competitors . Some leaders : <P> <P> Italy 's Manuelli <P> Italy 's biggest steelmaker is a civil servant , but hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the state-controlled Finsider steel complex : " I have more freedom of action than a man in my position in private business . Presidents of Fiat or Pirelli often have to get their boards ' permission before initiating changes . I do n't . " Several years ago , he rebuffed a government demand that Finsider build a plant in job-starved southern Italy , instead vastly expanded its plants in Genoa before moving down the Boot . Manuelli also publicly opposed the nationalization of Italy 's electric power industry this year , arguing that it would only upset the stock market ( it did ) and " double the public debt . " Socialists angrily demanded his scalp , but Manuelli held his job simply because he has done so well in it . <P> Manuelli is accustomed to political pressures . Rising through various state-run companies , he was picked by the first postwar Italian government in 1945 to head the Ansaldo shipyards , immediately became a target for Communist gunmen who had secreted an arsenal there in preparation for a general uprising . Manuelli cleaned out Ansaldo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket and with two " escorts " carrying tommy guns . Since he took charge of Finsider in 1958 , its sales have risen 45% to last year 's $761 million , and production has gone up 55% to 5,100,000 tons-a remarkable amount for a country that in 1945 produced only 400,000 tons . Rapidly expanding , Manuelli plans to double output by 1966 , produce 10.5 million tons out of an expected national total of 15.5 million tons . <P> But Manuelli is not a buccaneering empire builder in the manner of the late Oilman Enrico Mattei . " I welcome competition , " he says . " After all , the more steel we have , the better for Italy . " <P> <P> Finland 's Halle
