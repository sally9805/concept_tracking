THE industrial city of Kassel , Germany , is off the tourist track , and its art museum has only 60,000 visitors a year ( as against 200,000 each for Munich and Cologne ) . Yet Kassel 's Gemaeldegalerie can boast of one of the world 's most brilliant collections of early German and Flemish paintings , topped by no fewer than 19 Rembrandts . Kassel can thank the art-loving Landgrave Wilhelm VIII , who ruled Hesse from 1751 to 1760 . As a youth , Wilhelm did military service in the Low Countries , fell in love with Flemish art , and got in the habit of collecting it . Wilhelm 's finest trophy was Jacob Blessing the Sons of Joseph , which Rembrandt painted in 1656 , the year of his financial collapse and the beginning of his happy fall from worldly fame . <P> He had made his success with portraits , but Rembrandt preferred to paint religious subjects , which failed to interest Calvinist Amsterdam . Before his death , Rembrandt devoted 600 known drawings , 80 etchings and 160 paintings to Biblical subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his ailing son Titus in a ghetto garret , pitied by some and scorned by others , the fat old man was working joyfully , devotedly and profoundly for the ages . Among his inspirations was the warm and simple faith of the Mennonites. who taught direct recourse to the Bible , and the mystical writings of Jacob Boehme , who constantly employed the symbolism of light for good and darkness for evil . Some scholars maintain that Rembrandt 's characteristic and unsurpassed dramatic interplay of light and shadow stems from Boehme . <P> In Jacob 's Blessing , light seems actually to shine from the dying patriarch . Summoned to his father 's deathbed , Joseph has brought with him his two sons and his Egyptian wife Asenath , who is the mother of Ephraim , the younger son . Jacob blesses his grandsons , thus adopting them in effect and admitting them to the tribes of Israel . But against all custom , he is inspired to bless Ephraim first . Joseph gently tries to guide the patriarch 's hand to the head of Manasseh , explaining that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit , replies ( Genesis 48:19 ) : " I know it . my son , I know it : he also shall become a people and he also shall be great : but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he , and his seed shall become a multitude of nations . " In Christian tradition , this solemn and mysterious scene foreshadows the eventual triumph of Christianity , symbolized by Ephraim , so Rembrandt makes the boy 's hands form a cross . <P> With his genius for making light and darkness speak , Rembrandt surrounds the entire scene with a deathly shadow , concentrates the light mainly in Jacob as that moment 's vessel of God 's will , and then makes it leap and pour goldenly past the dark head and hurt eyes of Manasseh upon fair-haired Ephraim , who shines like his grandfather .
