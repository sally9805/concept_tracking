t used to be in this country ihat a mayor was a lkind of genial town fool . He presided at some committee meetings : the city councilmen were invariably out to get him , and usually succeeded without too much difficulty . ITe managed a hardware store or a movie house . He was competent enough to cut ribbons without hurting himself and pleasant enough to welcome foreign visitors without insulting them , but he was about as imaginative as the tax collector . He was relatively harmless . Occasionally he would come out with a statement about fluoridation or higher pay for firemen , and the citizens would read about it and wonder what he was up to now . Or , in the larger cities , he would manifest himself just before reelection by doing a little paving , planting , and dedicating . There were notable exceptions , of course ? the La Guardias , the Humphreys , the Mavericks ? but this was the general rule . Mayors of both large and small cities would spend a good part of their time begging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but owned the checkbook . It was a humdrum existence , and a thankless one , but not too great a strain on a man . Then something happened . It started about the time John Kennedy gave his inaugural . The cities became more important . Someone discovered that the votes were in the cities . In the early 1960s , a number of mayors of the new style took office . Most of them were liberal Democrats ; many of them had no previous experience in elective politics . Some bypassed the machinery and the machines that had dominated city politics before , and they got elected anyway , and then reelected . They joined a much smaller group of new-style mayors who had been around , lonely but active and productive , for several years ? Richard Lee in New Haven , who was elected to his first term in 1953 ; Joseph Barr of Pittsburgh , who started out in 1957 . Within a few years there had been something of a revolution in the city halls of the important cities of the nation : Ivan Allen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minneapolis and Jerome Cavanagh in Detroit in 1961 . Later were to come Floyd Hyde in Fresno , Joseph Alioto in San Francisco , John Lindsay in New York City , Carl Stokes in Cleveland , Richard Hatcher in Gary ? but , unfortunately , no one new in Gary 's neighbor , Chicago . Many of these men have now decided to retire from office . ( Others may retire soon without meaning to . ) Naftalin , Lee , Allen , Cavanagh ? the four mayors whose thoughts are recorded here ? are leaving office this year . Arthur Naftalin has already left . They are not the only ones . Joseph Barr of Pittsburgh decided this year not to seek a third four-year term . Milton Graham of Phoenix is leaving ; Floyd Hyde has already gone to run what is left of the Model Cities program for President Nixon . Thomas Currigan , mayor of Denver for seven years , resigned last January in the middle of his term to work for Continental Airlines at a salary considerably larger than the V4,000 he was getting in City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mayors are quitting because of money . They cite various reasons for retiring , from bad health to assertions that they have accomplished what they set out to accomplish . Privately , some of them say that they suspect some of the others are quitting because their polls show they could n't win again ; they all say their own polls show them capable of winning handily . The more fundamental reasons probably have something to do with the end of an era . The new-style mayors started out , many of them , in a time dominated by John Kennedy , by his concern with the cities and the people who lived in them . And then came Lyndon Johnson , who put millions of dollars behind the ideas the Kennedy Administration had started to formulate . The cities were in their heyday . Now the prospects are not so great . As one mayor , who did not want his name used , put it , " If you think anybody with any integrity or any executive ability in the field of public administration is going to hang around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then you 're crazy . " It is not just the prospect of lean days to come that makes these men decide to quit . Jerome Cavanagh of Detroit says , " It is expected that the mayor deal with crises day after day . And this is one of the major factors contributing to the tremendous physical and mental frustration which eventually wears guys down in these jobs after eight years . You ca n't sit and think about what you should be doing in this city five years from now , or ten years from now , because you 're dealing with the politics of confrontation constantly . It 's the only political job in America in which that 's true . That 's the job . It 's fine to deal with crisis and confrontation if you have resources to meet them . But when all you have is a limited amount of money and a few programs , and you 're long on rhetoric . that just is n't enough . " T he new-style mayors are probably the hardest-working men in public life today . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write their own speeches . The people who are articulating the needs of the cities ? and who are , in some rare but important cases , coming up with tentative solutions ? are not the black or white militants , who still are working manfully at the task they started back in the summer of 1966 when the cry of " Black Power " was first heard by the Mississippi roadside : the task of organization and " togetheruess . " Nor are they the foundations and sociologists and schools of social work , whose accomplishments remain bureaucratically dull , unimaginative , and safe . Nor are they the elected and appointed officials in Washington , for Kennedy 's promises and Johnson 's passion soon gave way to Johnson 's disenchantment , to Agnew 's blunders and then his silence , to what many expect to be Romney 's demolition of most of the Democrats ' programs . Nor has much of the press been intelligent and realistic on urban problems and solutions . It is the mayors ? maligned , abused , underpaid , and generally powerless men ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been doing it before Congressional committees , before Presidential commissions , in dedication speeches at public facilities , in welcoming speeches to the conventions they work so hard to attract , and often to any half-bright citizen who wants to sit and talk with them . They have very little institutional power , and what they do have they are now being asked to give away in the name of community participation . This is frustrating . because the new-style mayors believe , at least in theory , in community participation . They have troubles within city ball as well as out in the neighborhoods . They find and develop good staff assistants , bright young planners and theorists , and then watch them disappear to Washington or into private industry . The systems they use to get information ? to find out what works and what fails in other cities ? are crude and often unreliable . A city 's newspapers and broadcasting media do not carry what happens in another city unless there is a riot , a catastrophe , a particularly interesting murder , or an election . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York City , as atypical as it is , is going to happen sooner or later in other cities . If the police and firemen strike in New York , they will soon strike in Detroit and New Haven ; the same goes for battles over school decentralization , the failure of a telephone system , transportation breakdowns . Many of the mayors have walked into the middle of their riots , and they remember the details of the summer of 1967 the way the rest of us rememberprecisely what we were doing the moment we heard of John Kennedy 's assassination . They have had successes ? notably in devising new programs , having them developed nationally by Washington , and then getting federal money to execute them locally . And they have had severe failures ? typically , when it turns out that Washington does not have the staying power to see an urban program through to the end . An amazing number of law-and-order candidates are running this year. * Minneapolis has already elected one . In Atlanta , the list of candidates headed for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , one law-order-andjustice man , one justice man , and one black man . " In New Haven , the Democratic party organization , deprived of power for years because of Lee 's domination ( he preferred to appoint competents rather than party backs ) , became so excited at the prosspect of reentry into the political mainstream that it rammed through for nomination a candidate who had neglected to say what he was for , thus angering even more the other hopefuls , two of whom were black . In New York City Mayor Lindsay , fighting for his political life in an uphill struggle , faces two law-and-order opponents in the general election . The new-style mayors who are leaving insist , however , that they have created a momentum which can not be reversed by any but the most diabolical law-and-order replacement . And they think they have added something else . Ivan Allen of Atlanta says one of the things he feels most strongly about his eight years in office is seeing " an acknowledgment of the integrity of the city government . " Such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America who still do not participate , by the blacks who still have no power , by the whites who still feel unrepresented , and , in Atlanta , by the thirty-eight hippies Mayor Allen 's police department had arrested the night before he made his observation . But , still , many cities seem a little different now . Perhaps one of the differences is integrity . Naftalin of Minneapolis If you know that Minneapolis recently elected its law-and-order man as mayor , you might be surprised when you step off the airplane . There are practically no Negroes . In the menial airport jobs , those reserved for blacks in the rest of the country , one sees young white men with Scandinavian features . At a motel , they give you two keys . One of them is for your room ; the other is for the front door of the motel , " To keep the neighborhood kids out , " an employee says . Later you learn that there is a public housing project not far away . Minneapolis has a population of something less *See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , August 1969. than half a million , only 3 per cent Negro , and you wonder what the whites are afraid of . At 9:00 A.M. a set of amplified chimes plays " Fascination " all over downtown . The air is remarkably clean . There are pleasant drives along the Mississippi River , and the city has several well-kept lakes . You can park all day downtown for eighty cents . But they are scared of something . The night before , a black leader had called off his picket lines in front of two stores at the corner of Plymouth and Queen Avenues , on the grounds that the new mayor , Charles Stenvig. a former detective on the burglary squad and president of the Police Federation , had torpedoed the blacks ' attempts at negotiation . There had been some brick throwing . The demonstrators had alleged that the food stores were charging exorbitant prices and were being kept like pigpens . There was another story in the Tribune that morning quoting some Indians that Negroes had discriminated against them in the poverty program . Plymouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered by plywood ; it was difficult to tell whether the boards were new or left over from the riots of P.166 and ' 67 . At least they were plywood , and therefore they seemed temporary . In Detroit , store window after store window has been filled in with cinderblocks and bricks , and you know this is permanent . In Minneapolis there is artwork on some of the sheets of plywood . " Love Is Where It 's At , " someone wrote . On others there were faded posters : " We Need Stenvig for Mayor . " There was a poster depicting a kindly cop . and the words , " Let us ... Serve You . Sponsored by the Police Officers ' Federation of Minneapolis in Connection with the FBI . Henn . County Sheriffs , and the JCs . " Arthur Naftalin sat in a small , windowless basement office in a building near the University of Minnesota . Before him on his desk was a yellow legal pad covered with handwriting . He had gunmetal-gray hair , a tolerant face , the look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ivory tower than within it . Last July Naftalin stepped down as mayor of Minneapolis after serving four two-year terms . Before that he had been a professor of political science , a political columnist who appeared in Minnesota newspapers , and the executive secretary to another Minneapolis mayor , Hubert Humphrey . Now he had become the first staff member of the university 's new School of Public Affairs ; his work will consist of teaching and writing in the field of public policy . You announced last December that you did n't want to run again , and you were succeeded by a policeman . What were your reasons ? just announced I was n't going to run , that 's all . From the very start I 've never regarded myself as irrevocably committed to public life ? as starting upon a public career in which I 'd first be mayor , then run for Congress , then for governor , and wind up in the Senate and eventually become President . ? ? ? ? ? ? ==l ? - I figured I 'd run for mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got elected . I was n't sure I was going to run for a second term , but by and by I decided there were things I wanted to finish off . The third time there was n't much opposition , and I was coasting along with reasonably good public acceptance , so I ran again . I ca n't explain why I sought the fourth term , because by then I think I had done pretty well all I was going to do . But some problems had begun to emerge , especially in human relations , and I felt an obligation to go on . My decision not to run again , I suppose , was basically that I felt that there were other ways I might spend may time , pursue my interests ; I might do some lecturing and some writing , some teaching , more relaxed and more privately , and enjoy life . Mayor Stenvig 's campaign slogan was , " Take the handcuffs off the police . " Is there that much of a problem with law and order in Minneapolis ? What the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just one factor . Several conditions were present , and it would be very hard to weight their importance . But certainly one factor was the growing reaction against what many , many people came In feel was an improper assertion of pressure on the part of , let 's say , militants . This ca n't be denied . Are the whites here all that frightened by fifteen thousand Negroes ? It does n't take very many to cause a reaction . An entire city can he thrown into panic if it thinks there are three men with high-powered rifles out on the street sniping at people . Of course . ihat was not happening here . What happened here ills that a very large number of people in the eit ? it that the militants , whatever the justice of th cause , had far exceeded the proper bounds of p die be- havior . And many people came to feel that the militants ' expressions of protest , their demonstrations , could be curtailed and checked if there was somehow a more vigorous law enforcement . Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different from the prevailing one which was that the way to handle these disturbances was to have a fierce assertion of law and order ? and that somehow this would be an answer to the problem . While the demonstrations were exasperating and the expressions of the militants threatening and disturbing , the proper reaction should have been not to go out and meet this in a direct confrontation , but rather to attempt to identify the real causes of concern and to work hard on those . I never felt , during the time I was mayor , that we ever had anything less than proper law enforcement in Minneapolis .... early 1969 a group of students , mainly black , took over the administration building at the University of Minnesota . Naftalin and the university president , Malcolm C. Moos , agreed that the city police should not come in unless they were needed . But the Hennepin County grand jury returned indictments against three black students . Demonstrations were planned against the county officials As it turned out , the protest was to be held at Nicollet Mall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created , the city council had passed an ordinance prohibiting parades there . ... I decided I was not going to try to argue them out of their demonstrations on the grounds that they were illegal . And I was not about to mobilize the police department for a confrontation because I knew this would cause a pitched battle . I asked members of the city council to come to my office , along with the leaders of the police department , the courts , and everybody else involved , and I persuaded them that the better part of our judgment was to permit the students to demonstrate and not to invite a confrontation . ' the policemen on the street were instructed to be friendly and courteous , and they were . The thing had a kind of carnival spirit . There was no damage ; there was n't even much litter . Nobody was interfered with in their shopping . They bad their demonstration ; they made their point about their opposition to the grand jury 's action . Mayor Allen , o f Atlanta , believes the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strident law-and-order type . Have you had a chance to see that theory tested since Mayor Stenvig took office ? There 's no question about it . Unless a man is wholly irrational and given to extreme conduct , the responsibility of office is going to point him in the direction of respecting the due process . I 'll give you a good illustration of what happened after Stenvig took office . Again on the Nicollet Mall , as the weather got nice during the summer , some of the young men and girls , the hippie crowd from the university , decided to go down to themall , as they do in cities all over the nation and all over the world . Wherever you 've been you see the young , long-haired kids downtown , bathing in the sun and doing whatever their thing is . Sometimes they get amorous and do things that to many people are rather offensive . So the cry has gone up , since Stenvig , became mayor , that they ought to go in there and clean these kids out . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive the students off , the first thing he did was to ask the city attorney what his authority was . And the city attorney said that the Loitering and Lurking ordinances , under which he might take action , were probably unconstitutional . To my knowledge Stenvig has n't done anything . Has the job of mayor increased in importance in recent years ? Yes . The position of mayor has become more conspicuous , more the target of public attention , because the problems have become so serious in all our urban centers ; everybody 's thrashing around , trying to hod effective leadership . The mayors , especially the mayors of the larger central cities , have begun to play a more crucial role . As the problems grow more and more difficult , the public has come to demand more , although they do n't know where to look for it . They demand more of the state legislature , of the county government , of special districts and agencies to deal with single purposes . While the mayor may have emerged as a critical figure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective figure . He 's got all the same old baggage , all the old inadequate machinery to work with , and he finds it increasingly impossible to provide the leadership that 's expected of him . Given all these restraints , plus the added restraint in Minneapolis of the weak-mayor system , what were you able to accomplish ? I would point to three things . One , and this might be hotly contested in some quarters , I think I contributed to a broadened sense of community involvement and community responsibility in civil rights . My position throughout was that the riots were symptomatic of deep-seated problems . This position is now being reacted against by all the lawand-order talk . But I believe that by my policies and my conduct in office , I educated a lot of people to accept my point of view . Our business establishment and our leadership generally feel now that the community can deal with its problems if it just rouses itself to do it . Two , the creative and very extensive redevelopment work we 've done in Minneapolis . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city planning commission , and I would give the city council credit , too . My critical function here was to be an unflagging supporter of redevelopment , renewal , rehabilitation , and public housing . And this pressure has made it difficult for the city council to react to neighborhood pressures , which tend to he against redevelopment . Three , and this is probably the most controversial , 1 have been outspoken in supporting major moves like metropolitan government . How would you describe the problems that confront the cities now ? There 's a long , long list . Everybody knows them . On the physical side , you name it : transportation , sewage disposal , airports , housing . in some respects the social problems are n't more obvious , but they are more ominous . Discrimination and poverty , insecurity , alienation . Modern life is in many ways contradictory and oppressive . From my experience , black people ? not all of them , but so many black people ? feel oppressed in our society . And they are oppressed . Many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel doubly oppressed . Bright and sensitive people feel oppressed by the growing congestion , the noise , the emptiness , the materialism ? so many things that only bewilder us . And old people often feel oppressed , feel that they 've been used and are being discarded . The manifestation of this whole sense of oppression takes pathological forms : divorce , alcoholism , drugs , insecurity , sadism . We live in a time of profound revolution . We do n't understand very clearly what these pressures are generating , and they worry us : they frighten us ; they 're obviously creating magnificent new opportunities that we do n't quite know how to utilize . We 're tied by our myths and prejudices and our biases out of the past . We 're terrified by the destructive potential and by the actual destruction that 's taking place . Only against this background can one talk about racial disturbances , law and order , the rebellion of youth , the problems of cities . I regard much of what I see as obscene . I regard the Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Nixon have an awareness of the real depth of the disturbance that is going on in this country and in the world . They may reflect the retreat of the public . But my criticism of the President is very severe , because I do n't think anybody ought to aspire to be President unless he has an awareness of the character of this enormous transition and is prepared to mobilize the full resources of the nation . What we have instead is business as usual : wait until the war in Vietnam is over ; wait until we 've gone to the moon , to Mars , to where not ; wait until we 've given a tax reduction to the middle class and the upper class . Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , And then this myth of trying to use the states ? this new federalism ? is just junk , really . There 's no other way to describe it . This inaction is all because it 's supposed to be politically hep to do what the American people want . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way it ought to be now . Nixon ought to be talking like I 'm talking , saying to the American people that we 've got to massively produce the resources we need for a public school system , for higher education , for distributing income so we really destroy poverty . We do n't have to take ten years to destroy poverty ; we can do it in a year or two . There 'd be some waste in it ; maybe some boondoggling . Maybe some scoundrels would get away with a little more than they should . So what ? American businessmen have been doing that for two hundred years . The cities are immobilized . That 's the key : the city . You ca n't escape in the city . But the city ca n't act , either . We have to do two things . We 've got to have a reassumption on the part of the national government of its responsibility . We have to have national programs , and we have to have massive national commitments . Second , we 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The default there has got to be ended by reconstituting local governments in a naturally organic way . That means , to begin with , that we should take the 212 Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas in this country , the SMSAs , and reconstitute them into viable governments . We do n't need four hundred units of government in this metropolitan area of 1.8 million people . We ought to reduce them to one effective government and permit it to use proper computers , all the modern instruments of technology . Would the public ever accept metropolitan gov-ernment ? In time they will , just as they have begun to here with the Metropolitan Council . If the President of the United States were to talk in these terms , to say that we 've got to begin now , it would help . Would the voters approve it ? It might be one of the worst donnybrooks you ever saw . But it would be a donnybrook worth having . All we have now is paralysis . Some people in the suburban communities think they 've got an advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is true in some cases . They figure they 've got their petty little operation and that they can have their own restrictive zoning patterns ; they figure they know the cop on the corner and if they get drunk they do n't have to he worried about being clapped into jail in downtown Minneapolis . They figure they 're going to hide from the rest of the city . I think it would liberate all our communities if we had one metropolitan govern-men t . I f this happened , would the logical central point for a metropolitan government be the office of mayor ? Yes . I 'm what I sometimes call a " structuralist . " I have confidence that if the system is properly organized , a lot of things are going to happen . If you get a good structure ? and that structure ought to be metropolitan , organic , regionwide ? it ought to be presided over by a chief executive . And that chief executive ought to be the mayor . The structure itself will generate its own momentum . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And if the structure is properly developed , it 's going to attract leaders of quality to it . Why should anybody want to be mayor of a city today , when it 's so paralyzed ? It is n't because people do n't want to work hard at these problems . It 's just that they can take only so much frustration . What will happen to the cities if none of this is done ? What I see happening is the continued deterioration of our physical environment . I do n't see anything reversing it . We could reverse it pretty easily . It 's a matter of having the public will to do it . But our problems are going to get worse and worse , and more and more wealthy people will retreat from the urban centers . It 's going to become more and more expensive to build the island in the city , the luxury skyscraper . It almost looks like a garrison already ? uniformed men outside , patrolling with guns , padlocks on every door . The inner city is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to become more defensive and protective . Industry is going to become more decentralized , creating complications in transportation . And we 'll see further fragmentation . And I suppose , then , by and by , when we seem to be almost at the breaking point , maybe we 'll undertake some massive programs . Socially , the situation is even more ominous . The lower one-fifth of the population is going to continue from bad to worse . And the rest of us are going to rationalize that this problem is n't as had as everybody makes it out to be . But I see nothing that 's even answering the problem of starvation , much less the other problems . Is the public at this point ready to do anything massive ? There 's no leadership asking them to do it . We 're blinded ; we 're so caught up , the 70 , 80 per cent , the affluent . in enjoying all the wonders of this great wonderland that we really do n't see the poor . Black people are still invisible for most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to really understand what it 's like to be black . Just as it 's difficult for a well person to understand what it 's like to be handicapped . And just as it 's so hard for the happily married mother of five who 's made it the hard way to understand why that woman who 's on welfare should have an illegitimate child and have a lover who 's run out by a night-rider ; offended by this . There are disjunctions in this society , and we 're hung up ; all kinds of people are just hung up . We 're going to remain hung up until there begins to be channeled into the national dialogue , from the White House , and permeating the country , ideas such as those we 've been talking about . This is my big disappointment with Pat Moynihan . He has succeeded in getting little nibbles at the margin of the problem . And I figure that 's a big defeat . And then people like James Reston : he 's protecting his news sources , I suppose . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's protecting himself by writing all those nice things about Nixon . And it 's just Here the former mayor paused , trying to find the right word . He tried , a couple , but rejected them because they were too emotional. ? and it 's just not even a start . Lee of New Haven On July 7 , Richard C. Lee , who had served as mayor of New Haven since 1953 , surprised many people by announcing he would not run for a ninth term . " Sixteen years covers portions of the span of life of four Presidents of the United States , " he said . " and in Connecticut of three governors ; and it has taken me from the age of thirty-seven to the age of fifty-three . " In his sixteen years , Lee and his city have had tremendous influence on the national government 's relationships with the cities . Many programs were started in New Haven which later became part of the national war on poverty ? and when they became national , Lee was always in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which to carry the new federal money home . Willard Wirtz , when he was Secretary of Labor . called New Haven " the greatest success story in the history of the world . " Robert C. Weaver , when he was Secretary of Housing and Urban Development , said it was " coming closest to our dream of a slumless city . " As the Alums were being eradicated , they were being replaced with imaginative , sometimes exciting , architecture ? a parking garage by Paul Rudolph , buildings by Eero Saarinen and Philip Johnson . Using flattery and artists ' conceptions of what the housing would look like after it had been fixed up , the city talked residents of Wooster Square , one of the older but nicer neighborhoods , into voluntary rehabilitation . Public housing of the traditional sort obviously was not acceptable to many citizens , so Lee concentrated on scattered-site and cooperative housing for low- and middle-income families . Lee had a lot of help : Edward Logue , who later went to Boston and then to New York State , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had begun to think seriously about physical renewal , one-third of New Haven was in the hands of the redevelopers and Lee , with the help of the Ford Foundation , was running a pilot program in human renewal called Community Progress , Incorporated ? a forerunner of the Office of Economic Opportunity . Mitchell Sviridoff , a labor official , was chosen to head that program . Later he went to New York City , then on to Ford . fOne week after the Detroit riot in 1967 , New Haven had its violence . Many interpretations were offered ; the one that seemed closest to the truth was that , while the city 's ambitious programs had succeeded in raising the expectations of the poor and the black , those citizens had not adequately been incorporated into the planning and execution of those programs . On this day in the summer of 1969 , sometime after Lee had announced his retirement , the Knights of Columbus were in town , holding their convention , and Lee was participating in the ceremonies , especially the dedication of the new Knights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massive concrete towers , 320 feet tall , connected by planes that formed the floors , and sheathed in glass ? boggled the imagination . It was designed by Kevin Roche-John Dinkeloo and Associates . Lee obviously was excited and proud . and as he spoke at the dedication he slipped into an Irish brogue that is not present in his normal conversation . The building seemed to be some sort of a memorial to his years as mayor . Later , Lee relaxed in a suite on the seventeenth floor of the Park Plaza Hotel ? which was built as another part of his ambitious downtown-renewal program ? and he talked about his administration . From time to time he glatired out the picture window at the K of C building and at a skeleton of concrete and wooden forms that was taking shape beside it . The skeleton would become a coliseum . Can a city be governed these days under the traditional democratic system ? I think so . It all depends on the quality of the candidates who stand for office under the two-party operation . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ca n't have 1928 philosophies burdening candidates now . There are too many people today who still feel that a city should be run in ways which , happily , have long since disappeared ? the idea of a city as a source of jobs for friends and patronage for the faithful , and a mayor who has no understanding or concept of the social ills of the city . The mayor is perhaps the most important single social force for good or evil in America today . What happens when you get a mayor who is attuned to all this ? I recognized a long time ago the social evils of a city , and the tragedy is that , like a voice crying in the wilderness , or the man who cries out too often , " Help , help , " when finally the day of atonement arrives , no one pays any attention . When I reached my tenth anniversary in this office , I guess , I began to realize that people just were n't paying attention . You and New Haven have been credited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been tried on a national scale Like riots . ? Yes , but yours came late in the summer o f 1967 , so you were behind a lot of cities . Have you found out which of your programs work , and which do n't ? The important thing now is neighborhood and community participation . People become involved in planning their own destiny and working out their own problems , neighborhood by neighborhood , and this can he the most exciting and perhaps the most rewarding of all . We did do this in the beginning , back in 195 7 and ' 58 . We were trying to instill into this somnolent public of ours the idea that they should get in and take an oar and help paddle the canoe . But the motion was not real ; the motion was all mine , running all over the city . We would get these crowds of people out and I would exhort them , and they would applaud and smile and we would have coffee and cake and I 'd pass out certificates , but there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as I wanted , not as much as was necessary .

Some o f your critics are black militants , or members of the white radical community . Are they any real threat to you , or to the traditional way of electing mayors ? Ali , the Radical Left . The reformers do n't have staying power . The two-party system is going to continue , and those who try to bring it down will he unsuccessful , because the country is built on it , and those who are trying to bring it down will be absorbed into it , and some will stand for election under it .

I found , as I really dug into it , for instance , that this nonsense of high-rise public housing for low-income families , without social services , is hogwash . We need scattered-site , low-income public housing . We need rent-certificate public housing , where people can literally fade into the woodwork and not have anybody recognize that they are low-income families . We need all kinds of special programs aimed at the low-income family , or the marginal-income family , or the family with social problems . The problem of physically restoring a city is almost secondary . And we have to lure back the middle class . We 've tried to make living in the inner city attractive to the higher-income whites and the whites who could provide leadership , many of whom have fled because they simply wanted suburban living , or because they did n't want to live in a city whose population was increasingly black , or whatever . We have to have a balanced city . You once said , " The question is , where are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you have even a tentative answer ? We have n't any choice but to fight for their survival and for improvement in the lives of their people , because the cities are the bastions of civilization . They 're the great centers of all our resources , financial and intellectual and cultural and traditional . Sure , they 're in trouble ; and sure , we despair . But we have it in our capacity as a nation not only to solve the problems of the people , but to rebuild our cities and finally to make them more beautiful . Could the election of a " law-and-order " candidate stop the momentum you 've started ? No. lie might slow it down . You 've said that few other mayors have served as long as you . What about those mayors , such as William Hartsfield , who preceded Ivan Allen in At . lanta , who served almost quarter-centuries in office ? Those were different years , and this is a different world . In those years , all you had to do was econo ? mize , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1969 it 's a totally different ball game than it was in 1960 , and this decade has probably been the most trying decade for mayors in America . The war in Vietnam , we 've been told , is going to draw to a close . The President has said troops are coming home . Well , let 's hope that some of those thirty billion dollars which are now being poured every year into Vietnam can be rechanneled into the cities . Do you really think the Vietnam money will be diverted to the cities ? * I do n't know what they 're going to do . I do n't have a crystal ball . But let me put it this way : they had just better do it , because these problems are so pressing , so urgent . Even the states have got to recognize more than ever before that the cities are corporate entities , and they 'd better begin to pay attention to them . Because all the problems of each state in America are inevitably bound up with its cities . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been saying it so long . Should we consider such cities as New York beyond salvation , and concentrate on . demonstration programs and smaller-scale efforts in the smaller cities , such as New Haven , where success is more likely ? 1 do n't think you should forget New York any more than you should forget Texas or California . You ca n't afford to forget the big cities . because inevitably they 're the magnets Which attract the most numbers of people from poverty-stricken areas . The slogan now is : " Is New York governable ? " And I agree with John Lindsay when he says , " Of course it is governable . " Because we have n't any choice but to make it work . We 've begun to cope with the problems of the cities . We 've uncovered some problems we did n't know existed . We 've been guilty . all over the land , of some of the most colossal failures in our programs . But as we approach the Seventies , I have optimism about the future simply because America has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will and wo n't work : we still have only been able to make our programs work in our smaller cities on a limited scale . The Wooster Square program is rehabilitation in its finest sense , but we have n't been able to apply that all over the city . All kinds of bureaucratic red tape and changes in administrative leadership have created chaos . The result is that we have n't been able to do as well as we should . And if we are not able to do that well , in a city that is much more easily controlled , then I do n't know how you can begin to apply the same lessons to New York . New York is eight million people . New Haven is 145,000 people . Boston is something like 600,000 . Detroit is close to two million . Chicago . But one thing we all have to remember is that they all have neighborhoods . And perhaps the way to make progress is on a neighborhood basis . We developed a theme called " community involvement " until we , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which almost ? but not quite ? sidetracked our goal of trying to rebuild and restore and rehabilitate . And by sidetracking I mean we got to the point where the leadership in these neighborhoods felt it was more important to take over programs , almost , than it was to have programs . Was that sidetracking perhaps necessary ? I think it was , and I think it is . Because what it really was , and is , is a development of leadership from an area and a group which never had leadership before , and where you previously simply found the leadership by anointing people to be the leaders . Co-opting them ? *Shortly after this interview was conducted , the Nixon Administration started saying that the diversion would be Co-opting them . Some people called them Judas goats , and other people called them Uncle Toms , Is the job of mayor set up in the most efficient form , or should it be changed ? In the European countries , and in London and Dublin , the mayor is purely a ceremonial creature , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mayors wear a badge or something or other around their necks , but the real work is not done by the mayor . In America , in New Haven as well as New York and Boston , the mayor does everything except sweep the kitchen floor . I would not change this except in this way : no sound , successful corporation thrives without proper delegation of responsibilities . There is a corporation , and you have an executive vice president , and a chairman of the board , and a president , and there is a vice president for planning , and a vice president for administration , and so on . Yet under the American system , we 're not allowed ? simply by public opinion ? to have deputy mayors , because we would be accused of padding the nest . If we do n't give the man who is mayor some flexibility in the operation of the system which runs the cities ? if we do n't give him some flexibility ? the cities are going to be in trouble . You 've got to have today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a vice mayor for operations , a vice mayor for planning . Yet none of these jobs is built into anyone 's budget , simply because either most people do n't recognize the need , or because most mayors dare not bring it up . This is really what any mayor needs . Staff recommendations should be blended so that the mayor is presented with a program that 's comprehensive enough to operate the city on a day-to-day basis . but also so he can plan in a very sound way for the city , not only beyond the decade . beyond the operation days of the man 's term in office , but literally almost through the balance of this century ! Would you do it all over again ? I sure would . Yes , I would . He laughed , long and hard . I was just thinking of those lines from Frank O'Connor 's wonderful book , The Last Hurrah . You remember that ? The old man , Frank Skeffington , the Irish politician , had expired , to all intents and purposes . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man whose life had apparently ebbed , and he said , " Well , no matter what some of us may have thought in the past , it 's all different now . And I think we can say this : That knowing what he knows now , if he had it all to do over again , there 's not the slightest doubt but that he 'd do it all very , very differently . " And suddenly this old man , Frank Skeffington , who apparently was dead , rose up and he looked this old fraud in the eve anti he says , " The hell 1 would ! " . " The hell I would ! " Oh , what a line ! A week later , Lee attended the meeting of the Democratic Town Committee , a meeting at which the party 's nominee for mayor would be picked . Lee was the keynote speaker . It would be , he said beforehand , a nostalgic speech . But when he got inside he had to throw away most of the speech . Crowds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood no chance of getting the nomination , some of them angry at the party , some of them angry at Lee , booed and shouted at him and at almost everyone else who dared to step to the rostrum . At one point a group of angry young people , most of them black , formed at the end of the platform , shouting , " The people want to be heard ! " They said they wanted to address the delegates on the subject of housing-code enforcement , and especially on the issue of lead-paint poisoning , which is a serious problem in New Haven 's remaining slum areas . A black police inspector held them off . A television crew turned on its lights . The crowd , which had been only yelling before , started waving clenched fists . The television lights went out , and the fist-waving stopped . A little later two persons had been arrested , and Mace had been used , and by the time the meeting was over there was an almost solid wall of policemen between the officials and the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On his way back to his limousine , he was asked if he had been worried , or disappointed , or angry , at the reception . He said he had been none of those . He smiled . " I can adapt , " he said . Allen of Atlanta The symbol of Atlanta is a phoenix , the Egyptian firebird which was said to live for five hundred years , to be consumed by fire , and then to rise again from its own ashes . The phoenix got on the official shield of the City of Atlanta because General Sherman burned the city down one time . Much of the city 's history since then is explained among Atlantans by good things issuing from tragedy . Integration , some of them think , was a tragedy of sorts ; out of it Atlanta has emerged as the leading city of the South . Ivan Allen , Jr. , a stationer who became mayor of Atlanta in 1962 ? defeating , among other candidates , the chicken fancier who was later to become governor of Georgia , Lester Maddox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . There is also a gold Coca-Cola bottle , which represents the other big part of Atlanta 's history . People could stop drinking Coke and Atlanta would not collapse , although a lot of citizens would wonder what to have for breakfast . But the phoenix remains vital . There is in Atlanta an emotion that is not found in many other American feeling of deep and simultaneous involvement with the past and the future . Guilt has something to do with it . Desegregation , for some white Atlantan , was almost a religious act . They learned something from it . They wanted and planned to learn something from it , and they would have been disappointed if they had n't . ( See how Mayor Allen uses the word " agony " below . ) The hotels desegregated with great anguish and secrecy and fear on the part of the innkeepers . who believed that nobody would stay there any more . Now you can fight to pay $27 a night for a hotel room that is reached by glass bubbles gliding up through a courtyard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks like a flying saucer . I had lived in Atlanta back during the early sit-ins , and had watched the black students from Spelman and Morehouse and Atlanta University sitting in the hotel lobbies with tiny suitcases , trying to get themselves registered . When I showed up not long ago to claim my reservation at the fancy hotel with the bubbles and the flying saucer , my room was not available . The hotel had overbooked because of the convention of the Negro funeral directors ' and morticians ' association . Near the phoenix and the Coke bottle in Ivan Allen 's office are symbols of the city 's present : thirty-eight silver-plated shovels and two gold-plated ones . Each silver shovel represents a construction project under way in the city whose cost , according to its building permit , will exceed one million dollars . Gold represents ten million . The mayor presents the shovel to the builder upon the completion of the job , along with a tax bill . And there are footballs and baseballs on the mayor 's shelves , representing the city 's entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Allen says , " on ground we did n't own with money we did n't have for a team we had n't signed . " Atlanta is audacious , but , unlike Dallas , it is not audacious in a right-wing way . Ivan Allen , aided no doubt by audacity and phoenixes , went before the Senate Commerce Committee in 1963 and testified in favor of the public-accommodations section of the civil-rights bill then before Congress ; this surprised many people . In 1965 he as much as anyone else was responsible for the dinner that was held in Atlanta in honor of Martin Luther King 's winning the Nobel Prize . In 1966 , when violence struck in Atlanta , Alien walked through the middle of the riot and thought , for a few moments before he keeled over , that because he was on the right side the tear gas would n't bother him . Last January he announced he would not run for reelection , and the Rotarians who heard him make the announcement shouted , " No ! Nor ' Why did you decide not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle age . My responsibilities were to project a major program of development for the city . And even larger than that ? although I do n't think we fully recognized it ? I had the responsibility , being in a position of leadership , to bring about social changes . This has been accomplished in Atlanta . It has not been completed . But the major racial change is well on the road , and I 've basically completed the program I came into office for . We 've accomplished everything except rapid transit , and we 've brought that as far as the people were willing to let us go with it . I 've served for eight years . I 've been subjected to constant confrontation . I feel that I 've done my job , and the time has come for me to think about myself a little . I do n't think that I 'm physically able to go on forever in a job like this , and after eight years it 's time for me to step down . What satisfactions have you gotten out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us have in life is the opportunity of doing something for other people - particularly the underdog . And I expect that by far the most satisfactory product of my eight years has been the opportunity to move into the civil-rights issue and to be able to see the material accomplishments and the expansion of the rights of the Negro citizen . Do you think the job of mayor has changed , in status or responsibility , in recent years ? It used to be a static job . This was before we started our big urban growth , and before the full impact of the civil-rights crusade had hit the cities . Mayors were more or less running an established operation that went through conventional political channels to get things done . But suddenly we reached an era of demand that has required the rebuilding of the cities . At the same time there has been a shift in the population , and so in most of the urban centers for the first time in history we are now having to furnish services to a large percentage of the population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city services before . You told the National Commission on Urban Problems that the big problem was the arrival in the cities of people who were not prepared for urban living . Are you getting much help in coping waft that problem ? No . Many cities , particularly Atlanta , are absolutely strapped by the limitations imposed on the corporate charter by the state legislatures . We do not have the right to levy anything except limited forms of taxation . And in today 's increased labor market , with everything going up rapidly , and with the new demands for services for additional people who never received them before , we are simply confronted with financial problems that we do n't have the least capability of answering . Governments never accept a problem if there 's a way to pass it along to some other government . If there 's some way for the City of Atlanta to unload a problem on Fulton County , you 'll find that it will be handled in that way . And vice versa . The states were able to bypass the racial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Negro and the poor were treated so badly in rural areas that they have fled to the cities of America . The cities have no entrance requirements . We are inheriting thousands of people who are simply not prepared to live in the urban centers . This is really where the buck stops . There 's no place to pass it any further . Being ignored by the states ? and they 're all involved , in the South , in bitter racism ? all we can do is turn to Washington . How has that relationship turned out ? As far as Atlanta 's concerned , it 's been highly productive , and it 's provided the major catalyst for the growth and development of the city . We 've managed to get hundreds of millions of dollars of federal funds pumped in here to provide for thousands of units of low-income public housing , to create twelve great urban-renewal areas , and to rebuild vast areas of the city ? and now the Model Cities program , and many secondary programs . And yet , it 's still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and county governments , and the inadequacy of city financing ? the federal money has not , by itself , been enough to take us entirely out of the slums . If the cities are the focal point of society 's problems , is the focal point with the city the mayor ? The mayor happens to be the one public official who is readily available to all the people he represents . It 's just a short spin down to City Hall . I 'm not saying that all this is not good . But being involved in these daily confrontations will upset anybody 's stomach after a period of time . You do n't walk into the middle of a race riot without losing a few years off your life . You do n't meet unruly entrances into your churches or anticipate take-overs by students of colleges , or go through a firemen 's strike , or all the picketing and boycotting and demonstrations that have come out of the racial issue ? and then Martin Luther King 's funeral . Of course , that was an event of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goodness . It was the biggest event that ever happened in Atlanta . Bigger than Sherman 's March ? It made Sherman 's March look like a nickel . You call yourself a liberal . Yet in 1953 you were quoted as saying , " Negroes have got to learn to respect the traditional rights of ' segregation , ' and you were praising the county unit system the infamous device through which political power in Georgia was placed almost entirely in the hands of the small moribund counties and their small , moribund leaders . How can you square that with being a liberal today ? The sit-iris in Atlanta started in 1960 and went through the spring of 1961 , Manned by students from the Atlanta University Center and with the eventual leadership and help of Dr King , the demonstrations threw white Atlanta businessmen into the sort of misery businessmen can feel . Money was being lost ; the city , which had long prided itself on 81 being better than Birmingham , was having severe image problems . Allen had just been elected president of the Chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the help of a white lawyer , Robert Troutman , and a black lawyer and leader , A.T . Walden , to try to work out a solution . ... They told me that I had a responsibility , as president of the Chamber , to furnish the leadership . Well , you really do n't know how to do these things . There was no experience in it , there were no textbooks , there were violent feelings on both sides , and we sat down , the three of us , and began to discuss the problem . We got the promise of cooperation from the press . Then Robert Troutman and I went before the white business community . They said in so many words , " For God 's sake , see if you can settle the issue . Go ahead , take the necessary action , tell us what you want us to do . and we 'll back you up . " Businessmen understand that you send a man to do a man 's job and you do n't treat him like a boy when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent suit you . It was an entirely different question with the Negro community . There were things involved which we did n't understand . The Negro citizen here had never had the opportunity of making decisions , and he suddenly found himself confronted with decisions that were momentous . He was n't accustomed to meeting with the white man in a relationship that provided for equal treatment . He did n't understand the integrity of the business community . He questioned any agreement . And all of this was reasonable , for the white South had never done anything for him . He had long negotiations with the Negro leaders . We learned some interesting things . When you went to a meeting in the white community and you had twenty-five people there and the first man up provided the right solution and the right answer , everybody else voted aye and the meeting was over and you went home . Here . the lack of participation in decision-making was evident in the Negro community . The first man up , Mr. Walden , would state their position , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a speech on his reasons for supporting it . So what was a ten-minute decision among the whites was a two-hour trauma in the Negro community . But all this we had to learn .... After months of negotiation , Allen and the others worked out a settlement : the stores would desegregate shortly after the schools opened , with token desegregation , the following fall . The distant date angered some of the younger Negroes . Dr. King was to play an important role in resolidifying the movement . Ivan Allen was being mentioned as a potential candidate for mayor , to replace the retiring William B. Hartsfield . The stationer who once had accommodated himself to segregation and the county unit system had become a liberal white man . ... I was beginning to understand and appreciate the great indignity and indecency that had been heaped upon the Negro people by the segregated system . This was something that we had never really fully understood . because we had never tried to understand it . And this was my first real introduction to it . How mud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal white voters have on a city 's life ? There 's no question that the tendency of the Board of Aldermen of Atlanta to enact fair legislation , and not to discriminate against the Negro community , and the conduct of the mayor 's office , are protected by the strong voice of the Negro community here . You just do n't go out and alienate 35 or 40 per cent of the vote by misusing your position . You do n't aspire to any other political office ? No. if 1 bad been ambitious to run for the Senate or for governor I would not have taken some of the positions I have . If I ran for governor , the issue would n't be the fact that Atlanta 's the most successful . prosperous , higgest part of Georgia . There would he just one issue , and that would be nigger and Martin Luther King . They would absolutely whip me to death every time I got up before a crowd in rural Georgia . I had to face this in the beginning and put aside any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do my job properly here . I think the most correct thing I ever did was to testify on behalf of the public-accommodations act . And I did that with the full knowledge that that ended my career as mayor of Atlanta . Both the white and the Negro communities told me this . It did n't turn out that way . But no person in political office with additional ambitions is going to take that kind of chance . What about " community participation " ? Did the enlightenment of the electorate in Atlanta make it easier for you to guarantee citizen participation in the city 's renewal and antipoverty efforts ? The affluent white community in our cities has always known how to communicate with City Hall . Their getting done what needed to be done came about through a very orderly process of appearing at the proper committee meetings . They were the educated ; their voice was heard ; and this pattern was generally established all over the nation , and it became the acceptable pattern of government back in the static days of the cities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of a sudden the desire arose for neighborhood meetings , because this section of society did not know how to get to City Hall , did not have a voice in it . Among other things , its working hours prevented its being there . We started neighborhood participation ? basically as sound a theory as exists ? to bring the underprivileged into government and to create a stable society , which is what you 're working for . But though in theory this kind of participation is excellent , developing it is a great agony . It 's like a child with a quart of ice cream . If he likes the ice cream , he 's going to eat too much of it . When you start involving the poor and the neighborhoods , you build up more liabilities , because you 've answered only a small part of the problem . You open up a Pandora 's box . What 's the solution for that ? Time . Your training as a businessman helped you during the sit-in negotiations . Has it helped you as mayor ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpful ; in administrative techniques , delegating authority , holding people responsible for their accomplishments . But there are other business practices which will not work in government . In business you can make a pragmatic decision based on the facts and you can implement it the next day . This is not necessarily true in government because the power of government goes down to the people themselves . A good project may come up , and it may be perfectly obvious , but you can not successfully implement it without first having sold it at a public level . And the public frequently makes emotional decisions . I have an excellent example of that . I once had a promise of a huge grant from a private foundation . They wanted to give the city about $9 million to build a great cultural center in Piedmont Park . It was an anonymous gift , and I could not disclose who was giving it to the city . I thought we should pass the necessary bond issue to provide the matching funds . I never conceived there could he any resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't fully understand philanthropy ; failed to explain it to them , and we lost the bond issue . The issue was defeated because of a rumor that this was Negro money being given to the city to integrate the parks . The parks were already integrated and , besides , anyone should know that the Negro community , even in Atlanta , did n't have this kind of money . The project lost because of the racial issue . So it was the same old thing : in the South , we 've never been able to make realistic decisions without being warped to some extent by the racial issue . It does n't matter whether it 's economic , or social , or educational , or financial , or political . All of our decisions for a hundred years have been warped by the underlying background of depriving the Negro of his equal rights . And until we get past this stage , until we accept the Negro as a full American citizen , which he is going to be ? until we reach that point , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the South . Cavanagh of Detroit Mayor Jerome Cavanagh skimmed once again the brief welcoming speech he was to deliver to the AMVETS at their national convention , alighted from his limousine , and walked into the Sheraton-Cadillac . A few passersby said hello , but mostly they just stared politely . Ile was a celebrity to them , someone they see on television like Ed McMahon and the fellow who sells orange juice . He mounted the escalator that rose to the lobby , and greeted two men who had boarded the down escalator . " Hello , Mayor , " one of them said with a smile . Cavanagh ascended to the lobby and the two descended to the street level . One of them said to the other , " He 's a nice fellow , is n't he ? " " Yes , he sure is . It 's too had . TIe 's had his share of troubles . " " Yeah , he sure has . And that 's too bad , because he was such a nice guy , was n't he ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have objected to the past tense . He believes he may someday serve again as a governor or Senator . But there are difficulties in being a prodigy . A lawyer with no record in elective politics , Cavanagh became mayor in 1961 at the age of thirty-three , and became known as the " boy mayor . " Now he is forty-one and people , naturally , call him the " aging boy mayor . " Cavanagh is one of the most articulate of the big-city mayors . His description of the urban crisis is one of his greatest contributions , along with the more ordinary accomplishments of renewal , fiscal overhaul , and the liberation of money from Washington . He is also probably one of the most candid and open of the mayors : " He does not hide his emotions , " the Cleveland Plain Dealer once observed . This tendency to be frank is unusual in a politician , and it leaves him wide open to shade-tree psychoanalysis . One writer said Cavanagh " hides " behind dark glasses when lie is out on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sdn had nothing to do with it , " the mayor said . His openness , along with several well-publicized setbacks in his personal life and the devastating Detroit riot of 1967 in which forty-three persons died , made Jerome Cavanagh more a sympathetic figure than a target in the months following his announcement that he would not run again . It has been said that assassination threats against him have fallen off sharply since the announcement . Big , pleasant-faced , looking like an intelligent football tackle , he occupies an office high above the Detroit River . On his desk are the Holy Bible , two volumes of the Basic Writings of St. Thomas Aquinas , Eric Goldman 's The Tragedy of Lyndon Johnson , and Rod McKuen 's Lonesome Cities . What has happened to the job of mayor in recent years ? It 's increased in both importance and in status . Politically it 's been called a dead end . If that 's true , it 's because of a number of factors . One is the impossibility of fulfilling the expectations that people have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present-day problems are centered in the mayor 's office . The mayors have contributed , I think , to a very sharp definition of the problems that face the country . And in most instances they have also identified many of the solutions . But they do n't have the resources to put the two together . This frustrates a mayor who is extremely active within his job , and at the same time contributes to the discontent generated by his holding office . Are the mayors getting any help from the states ? The governors have become forgotten people , particularly under the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations . They have n't really faced up to the problems that affect their states . They 're what I call the " silent spectators " of the plight of people who live in urban areas . As inadequate as the federal-city programs have been , those that have bypassed the states have had a far greater impact upon the lives of people in the cities than the programs that have filtered down from federal to state and then down to the city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not just the inefficiency and the waste of money , but the fact that they have n't really made a dent in the lives of the people that the programs were designed to help . One of the reasons for that is the old-line bureaucratic structure of the state employment services and their counterparts in the Department of Labor . They really do n't know the gut problems down on the streets of a ghetto , or the problems of identifying , first , the people who need employment ? which sounds easy but is n't ? and then developing programs that not only provide job opportunities but also offer some hope and dignity . The mayors , their status or prestige , increased immeasurably in the past seven or eight years . Under the Nixon Administration , however , it 's a completely different bag . Vice President Agnew , who is supposed to be the liaison between the national government and the cities and the states , had admitted this in an article in Fortune . I asked him about this at the U. S. Conference of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the governors in the main are Republican and the mayors of the big cities are Democrats , and that the Administration was going to put the money through the governors . He said that state government was just too important an institution to bypass . And in the abstract I would agree . But the problems arc so desperate in the cities that we ca n't afford to wage an on-the-job training course for state government over the next five or ten years and hope they 'll begin to realize the desperation of the situation inside the cities . The state people are going through a stage that mayors went through ten years ago . They 're dealing mainly in rhetoric . In the early Sixties , the mayors were involved with all sorts of flourishing rhetoric ton . but they soon discovered that rhetoric just does n't pay off . Out there in the streets you have to try and produce other things . How have the mayors managed to rise to this new level of importance ? In my own instance , I hail never been in politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had been interested , but I was a lawyer practicing law . In this city , in ' 61 , like just about every other city in America , we were sort of drifting along after the Eisenhower years , economically in bad shape . There was a lot of volatility in the city . There were no candidates who were ? I thought ? addressing themselves to the real problems of the city , and the incumbent mayor looked as if he was going to win in a breeze . That was one of the reasons I decided to run . Well , with that came the Kennedy Administration . Now , the Kennedy Administration recognized that ? the votes were located in the major cities . Arid in the 1960 election they concentrated on the cities . So whoever was the political head of the city occupied a little more important position nationally . You had the interest of the officials in Washington . You had the problems locally that were beginning to surface , and then you had new men in the cities who decided to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal programs then were the products of some of these new mayors , and of sonic of the mayors ' offices , including my own . I could identify a whole series of programs that we helped to shape in terms of legislation . We had a very receptive Administration in Washington , and one that was looking for programs that would make them look good . People used to say , " What 's the trick ? How do you get all that federal money ? " Well , what we used to do is come up with an idea , take it to Washington , sell it to the Administration , and at the same time have a stack of applications ready on their desk for the moment the legislation was passed . The idea was to get there firstest with the mostest . Dick Lee and I used to have footraces to see who was going to get to Washington first .... Cavanagh was active in getting the Accelerated Public Works Act through , and was on hand the day President Kennedy signed it into law and designated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about formulating rules and regulations by which to administer the act , so Cavanagh suggested he would try to draft some guidelines . He went home to Detroit on Friday and worked with his staff all weekend . ... On Monday morning I went to Washington with the rules and regulations ? the suggested rules and regulations ? and , at the same time , a big batch of applications . All the work was done for the people in Washington , so they adopted practically all the rules , and at the same time they started to hand out money . They wanted the act to get moving ; they had to spend the money in a year ; they wanted to show some progress in these cities . And where else to do it but in Detroit , which was all geared up and ready to go ? We got $40 million under that act , and I think there was only $150 million or $200 million for the whole country . The Kennedy Administration recognized not only the socially redemptive value of the programs but also the obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sophisticated use ol power . Mayors have only started to use that power in recent years , have n't they ? There was no place really to use it before . The resources for the last twenty years have been somewhere other than the city . They were at the state or national level . It was n't until the early Sixties that the mayors discovered that they finally had a place to go to get some of this money . So they bypassed the states . And it was really the first time that there was any such help for the cities , other than local taxation , which the mayors were just swimming upstream on . So it is little wonder that the mayors feel so strongly about maintaining directly the one relationship that has provided them with at least some relief . I think the cities know as well as , if not better , than anyone else how best to spend the money . When I say " the cities , " I 'm not just talking about the mayor . There 's a great added dimension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extialegally , part of the whole picture of local government , and that is " citizen participation . " Some of the mayors had to learn it the hard way , but learn it they did . Now would you define citizen participation ? I view it as a concept of shared power , in that people should be able to control their own neighborhoods , particularly the poor neighborhoods . The wealthier neighborhoods have been doing it for years . They did n't call it " maximum feasible participation " or " citizen participation , " but that was what it was . The response of local city government has always been extraordinarily good to high-taxpaying , all-white neighborhoods , to homeowners ' groups that were organized and wanted streets resurfaced and trees removed or planted , and parks built . Then everybody suddenly got very concerned about " maximum feasible participation " when blacks and poor people started to say they wanted a voice in their own destiny , and in identifying what they wanted and felt they needed in their particular communities . Saul Alinsky was organizing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I invited him down to the office . Alinsky said to me , " I was told by a lot of our peole not to come down to see you because after an hour or two down here you 'd have me in your pocket . " Or something like that . He and I understood each other well . I said , " Flattery 's going to get you no place , Saul . " But he in effect said , " You know , you 're killing us . I ca n't organize that neighborhood ; every time somebody hollers , you 're out in that neighborhood putting a park in , " or something like that . And I said , " You 're damn right . That 's the way I survive . The way you survive is for me not to put a park in so you can organize the neighborhood against the so-called Establishment . That 's your side of the street . I 've got mine . ' There are , though , certain rules that the game has to be played by . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for administering the program is vested in the mayor . He ca n't abdicate that . responsibility . I used to bother a lot of people when I said categorically that if there ever was an impasse , it would be resolved by my making a decision on it . Was there any fundamental difference in quality between the programs that were planned by the communities themselves and the programs that were planned by the bureaucrats ? It is a fact that it 's slower making a program visible out in the neighborhoods when you do it with the community . But there 's a purpose . and a good and valid purpose , even in that . It upsets a lot of people in city government that a program stutters and stumbles out in a neighborhood for a couple of years while community boards argue and fight about commas and colons . It is a very frustrating thing , too , when you know the program 's a good one . You know the neighborhood 's going to benefit by it , and so on . You would like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the park in , or whatever it might be . But local people , officials in government , mayors , and everybody else , just had to learn that it 's not only the program that 's important , but the involvement of the people in the neighborhood . And that is almost the most important thing . Why did you decide not to run again ? My stated reasons were my real reasons , too . One , I wanted to devote more time to my children . I have a large family ; the four oldest boys are in my custody , and the four youngest children are in my former wife 's . That , coupled with the realization that after a while you get punchy on a job like this . I hate to use the sports analogy ? most politicians do use it ? but it 's almost like a fighter who answers the bell , you know : in the first few rounds you 're coming out , right off that stool , and then by the tenth or twelfth round you 're just dragging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bell would n't ring , forcing you into the center of the ring . There were days , sometimes even weeks in which that would happen in this job . And I stopped and talked to myself . The excitement of a campaign , a winning campaign , should n't be the reason why I would decide to run , as interesting as it is. *Alinsky remembers it a little differently . Advised of the mayor 's recollection , the radical organizer said , " It was not anything even remotely along that line . " Furthermore , he said , the poor people never did get control of their own programs . But the question I had to answer to myself ? and it was posed , interestingly enough , by Julie Edelstein ( Julius C.C. Edelstein , now the vice-chancellor for urban affairs at the City University of New York and former braintruster to Mayor Robert Wagner ) , one day during conversation a couple of months ago in New York . He said , " Do you really want to be mayor for the next four years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And I found that I had some major reservations . And if I have major reservations about it , well , then , I should n't be mayor , even if I win an election ? and the polls showed that I could win again , and I 'm convinced that I could have , too . You have spoken about the " renewal of human values of the city . " Can you see . some of that re-newal ? Yes , I can . I can probably see better today , too , the distance we have to travel than I did eight years ago , or five years ago , or four years ago . Seeing that great long distance to travel does n't mean we have n't traveled at least part of the way . We 've taken some first , and even some second , steps . What frequently is n't understood by a lot of people is the complete disenchantment with the political process and with the mechanics of city government on the part of the black community in this city before I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling that they were just not a part of the process that made decisions in this office and , in effect , in the city . And now , the Negro or black community is a very integral part ? and not just in numbers ? even with the alienation and polarization that subsequently has developed as a result of the riot and a lot of other things ? is a very integral part of the decision-making process of this office today . And that may sound like sort of a superficial thing , hut , believe me , it 's not . What do you think is going to happen to cities ? If we continue to leave unattended , nationally , the problems of poverty and social and radical alienation and discrimination ? and when I say " unattended , " I 'm not trying to minimize all the things that have been done in the way of legislation , but in my judgment , it 's only nibbled at the periphery of the problem ? if we continue that ? then clearly the problems are going to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse to change ? some of the priorities , but particularly the institutions ? are going to come tumbling down . The hard way . It 's a bad thing to contemplate . I do n't enjoy thinking about it . But I think it 's almost this simple : Either we can commit ourselves to changing the institutions of our society that need to be changed , to make them ? to use a term which I hate ? " relevant , " to make them responsive , or we can sit back and try to defend them , and at the same time we know that eventually they are going to have to topple , because they will be attacked constantly from the outside . There 's no escape from a job like this . You ca n't turn the phones off . You ca n't turn the riots off . You ca n't turn the problems off .
