In one 24-hour period last week , 31 U.S. fighting men died in Viet Nam . Among them were 16 Marines helping to mop up a trapped enemy unit below Danang and one infantryman in a patrol that was ambushed 40 miles north of Saigon . One of the 31 , impossible to single out , became the 30,000th American to be killed in action in Viet Nam since the grisly log was begun on Jan. 1 , 1961 . Almost half of the total ( 14,400 ) died this year , many in the three major offensives launched by the Communists since the Tet holiday on Jan. 30 . <P> Already the longest war ever fought by the U.S. , Viet Nam now ranks as its fifth costliest ( after World War II , with 291,557 battle deaths ; the Civil War , with 220,938 ; World War I , with 53,402 ; and Korea , with 33,629 ) . With the killed-in-action rate running at roughly 200 per week , Viet Nam should move past Korea into fourth place some time this spring-unless the negotiators in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more expensive for native combatants . South Viet Nam has suffered 73,118 military dead in the past eight years . The Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese , according to an Allied estimate based on sometimes undependable body counts , have lost 422,979 dead since 1961.
