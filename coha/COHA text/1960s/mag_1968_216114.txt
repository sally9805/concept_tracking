It is cloudy at the beach . It is ladies ' day at the golf course . His boat is in drydock , and his wallet wo n't stand a trip to the track . So what is a restless sports buff to do on a summer afternoon ? He could take in a baseball game , but he probably wo n't . Empty seats are the sign of baseball 's times . <P> Going into the season 's second half , eleven of the 20 big-league clubs are in the throes of attendance slumps . Ticket sales are 50,000 off last year 's mid-season mark in Houston , 126,998 in Pittsburgh , 245,592 in Atlanta . In San Francisco , paid admissions are already down 277,182 from 1967-a season that was also disastrous at the box office . Total big-league attendance is off almost 6% this year . And it would be far worse except for Detroit , where the Tigers , driving toward their first American League pennant in 23 years , have attracted 173,419 more fans than they had at this time last year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mogul has a theory . Cincinnati 's Robert Howsam blames the weather : " In 22 of our first 26 games we had either rain or the threat of it . " Others pick on TV and the unattractiveness of older big-league stadiums , at least two of which-Chicago 's Comiskey Park and Philadelphia 's Connie Mack Stadium-are located in ghetto areas , which many fans are afraid to traverse at night . The pitchers ' domination of the sport and the concurrent decline in hitting ( as of last week only eight major-leaguers were batting .300 ) undoubtedly have had an impact : " Pitching may be 75% of the game , " says a San Francisco sportswriter , " but hitting is 75% of the gate . " So has the fact that neither league boasts anything resembling a pennant race : the Tigers enjoy a 7game lead in the American League , and the St. Louis Cardinals top the National League by nine games . <P> The reasons go deeper . Interest in baseball has been falling off for years as people discover how exciting other sports and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence and sophistication of pro football , the frenetic pace of hockey and basketball , baseball seems elementary , antiquated and soporific . It still draws more fans in total than other pro team sports . But that is only because there are 1,620 big-league baseball games each season ( v. 182 pro-football games ) . Attendance per game in baseball has actually dropped by 2,639 fans over the past 20 years . Donald Deskins , a social scientist at the University of Michigan , says the big problem is that baseball simply is out of step with the times . " It 's too slow , " says Deskins . " It 's not action-oriented. "
