txt President Johnson asked Congress today to impose tight new controls on contributions to candidates for Federal office and to encourage . more political contributions by small givers . The President proposed that small contributors ? be encouraged by allowing individual contributors each year to deduct from taxable income the first $100 of their contributions for candidates . Mr. Johnson also asked for nearly complete disclosure of the sources of campaign funds in both primaries and general elections for Federal office . He proposed that members of Congress be required to disclose gifts and income for personal services . And he asked for a $5,000 limitation on the contribution from a single source to the primary or election campaign of any one candidate . Concern With Federal Posts The President 's major proposals Would apply to campaigns for Federal elective offices except for the $100 tax deduction , which would apply to contributions to candidates running for state and local offices , as well as Federal posts . In a message to the House and Senate , the President said that democratic government had ' no clearer responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yet , " he said , " for decades we have tolerated the growth or seeds of cynicism from the underbrush surrounding our present methods of financing political campaigns . " Present laws dealing with campaign financing have failed , Mr. Johnson said . " They are more loophole than law , " he declared . " They invite evasion and circumvention . They must be revised . " Broader Based Support While most of Mr. Johnson 's proposals were directed at tightening existing , largely ineffective statutes that attempt to . regulate political fund-raising , one , if enacted , would establish a new goal of enlarging the base of candidates ' financial support . This proposal , involving the tax deduction , represents " a necessary goal for a practical reason ? to meet the financial burden of modern political campaigning without inviting the undue influence of large contributors , " Mr. Johnson declared . ' The special tax deduction of up to $100 each year would not be limited to the 17 million taxpayers who itemize their deductions when they file their returns . Married persons filing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $50 each . The deduction could not be claimed by estates , trusts or corporations . There would be a separate line on every individual tax return enabling the taxpayer to claim this deduction . On the basis of estimates of the present level of indviidual campaign contributions , Administration sources calculate the loss in tax revenue that would result at an average of about $100-million over the four-year cycle from one Presidential elec tion to the next , with a peak loss of about $50-million in the Presidential election year . However , if the proposal resulted in an anticipated increase in small contributions , the loss would be greater . Allowing taxpayers who do not itemize deductions to deduct campaign contributions of up to $100 a year would introduce an entirely new privilege into the tax law . They can not now , for example , separately deduct charitable contributions if they claim the standard deduction , which for a married couple is 10 per cent of adjusted gross income or $1,000 , whichever is lower . The only separate deduction now allowed for taxpayers who do not itemize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of jobs . A More Important Goal High Administration sources concede that implicit in the President 's proposal is the assumption that encouraging political contributions , particularly by small givers , is a more important goal than encouraging , charitable contributions . They regard widespread financial support for candidates for public office as a matter involving a special act of citizenship , equivalent in many ways in a democratic society to the act of voting itself . So , they feel that political contributions warrant special tax treatment . However , some tax experts fear that the Administration 's approach may lead , in the longrun , to pressure for adding further special deductions to which nonitemizing taxpayers are entitled . They also fear that it could lead to further complexities in an already complicated system of tax law . As another method of expanding participation , the President asked that Congress allow the sale of campaign souvenirs at $5 each . Expenditures for such souvenirs would be counted as contributions and would be subject to the disclosure portions of the new law . Nothing Else Could Be Sold These souvenirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertising , that any candidate or committee would be allowed to sell . This would eliminate as a fund-raising device the sale of advertising in expensive campaign souvenir books . Present Federal law allows a national political committee to raise no more than $3-million a year . But it does not limit the number of national political committee or apply to committees that are active in just one state . . The law also limits Senatorial candidates to expenditures of $25,000 and House candidates to $5,000 . But it does not limit the number of committees that can raise and spend money on their behalf . Thus , the ceilings on total expenditures have been ineffective . The President would do away with them . Present law limits to $5,000 one donor 's contributions to a single Federal candidate or committee supporting him . But it does not limit the-number of committees to which one donor may contribute . In addition , the disclosure provisions are so inexact that the information that may satisfy the law is insufficient to enable ready identification of donors . The President asked Congress to require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just one state , to report in detail on every contribution and expense item of more than $100 . Forms on which reports would be submitted would be standardized and would require clear identification of contributors . Candidates for President and Vice President would be included for the first time under the disclosure provisions and exclusion of primaries and convention nomination contests from the law would be ended . The President 's proposal would limit to $5,000 the total amount that could come from any single source to the campaign of any candidate . A candidate could receive up to $5,000 from a single source in a primary and another $5,000 in the general election . A present loophole would be closed with the requirement that candidates report the original source of contributions , where these were given initially to a campaign committee , but earmarked for one candidate . Officials of the executive branch of Government now are forbidden by Executive order to accept gifts of more than nominal value . Mr. Johnson proposed that Senators and Representatives be required to report annually all gifts of more than $100 received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income from personal services , such as payment for speeches and legal services , received by each legislator or on his behalf . Their Government salaries and income from investments would not be covered .
