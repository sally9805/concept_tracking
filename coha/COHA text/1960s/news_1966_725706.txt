txt Once again talk is circulating on high Washington levels of sealing off South Vietnam 's borders . Such a sealing has always been impractical before . And it may still be . But events are reviving the question . Some system of frontier control seems to be the only way , in that half-war , to get an effective military and police grip on South Vietnam . If the northern and western borders ca n't be physically cut by barricades and minefields , then the next best thing is " control " by mobile forces . Both methods have been impossible until now . The enemy holds the mountain areas , which in turn control the infiltration routes . The question now is whether enough force can be bunched in South Vietnam to do the sealing job . It might mean boosting the total American build-up in Vietnam to well over half a million men . ( - 19 One major reform , which came in with the 89th Congress , seems doomed now to go out with the 90th . It 's the House " 21-day " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1965 to wrest Great Society bills from the unfriendly grip of the House Rules Committee . It lets the Speaker recognize a committee member in order to bring to the floor any bill that has been bottled up in the Rules Committee for 21 days without being reported out . Committee chairmen invoked the " 21-day " rule 12 times in 1965 . But the membership granted it in only half those cases . This year chairmen have tried 12 times to bypass the Rules Committee and succeeded only twice . The rule will probably be junked in 1967 . Republicans teamed with Southern Democrats against it last time , but lacked the votes . In the 90th Congress , however , the GOP expects to pick up enough new seats to throw it out . ED When Congress finishes plugging the loopholes in campaign-fund reporting it may lock out inequities but let in a lot of paper work . That 's the rub . More disclosure means more paper work . And that raises all kinds of questions , which the House subcommittee wrestling with the election-reform bill is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inundate the clerk of the House and the secretary of the Senate ? Or will the Comptroller General or a bipartisan commission step in and get buried under the avalanche instead ? And how must the candidate who gets a hand from a party advertisement compute his share of a newspaper ad plugging all his party 's office seekers ? Those are just a few of the puzzlers . One House skeptic doubts if Washington can hold enough filing cabinets to store the proposed accounting forms . Trends ... New nationwide surveys are showing that crime is like an iceberg ? there is more to it than gets reported . The National Crime Commission will issue findings , perhaps early this fall , on unreported crime in the United States . Many Americans will be shocked to learn that the crime rate is really far bigger than they thought . Evidence is already in that an enormous number of crimes in the country simply are never reported , especially crimes among the poor . A nationwide sample survey of 10,000 homes and in-depth surveys in Chicago , Boston , and Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime rate among the poor will challenge , many communities in at least two ways in the months to come : First , to find better ways of preventing crime ; and , second , to generate greater confidence among the poor in local law enforcement . How and why ... When President Johnson drew up his budget last year he did n't reckon on two major developments  --  one glad and one sad . One pushed the deficit down ; the other pushed it up . First , he underestimated the huge jump in revenues . Taxpayers poured in $4.6 billion more than President Johnson thought they would . They were simply just that much more prosperous than he expected . The sad news was underestimating the : : osts of the Vietnam whi .. The President loped it would end by June , 1967 . But now - ... everybody in Washington is anticipating a humping supplementary war appropriation for next January ? of about $10 billion . That will easily cancel out the jump in revenues and probably end up in either a big inflationary deficit next year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
