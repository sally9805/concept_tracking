Economics Minister Ludwig Erhard , that pudgy and popular fellow , has been itching to get his hands on the top job in West Germany , and can hardly wait for Chancellor Konrad Adenauer to retire as promised next fall . He has shyly nudged der Alte before , only to be rapped harshly on the knuckles . Last week Erhard puffed up his chest and tried again . <P> To a Munich newspaper , Ludwig declared his willingness to take over right now . " I would be ready to accept a call to the chancellorship if my party and the Bundestag so decided , " he announced , clearly hoping that others felt as he did . After all , many of West Germany 's restive politicians had been grumbling over Charles de Gaulle 's courtship of der Alte , wondering whether the price of Germany 's new friendship treaty with France was an unacceptable subservience to France , and whether it required siding with the French against both Britain and the U.S. <P> No Support . But when Erhard sat back to listen for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had overreached himself . At the first Cabinet meeting after Erhard gave out his readiness-to-serve interview , Konrad Adenauer simply smiled and agreed with every complaint poor Ludwig could think of . <P> Would the Chancellor flatly endorse Britain 's entry into the Common Market ? he demanded . Of course , Adenauer agreed blandly . Would Adenauer declare that NATO and close relations with the U.S. were the basis of Bonn 's diplomacy ? Naturally , smiled der Alte . Then came the clanger . Would Adenauer disassociate himself from De Gaulle 's ideas of creating a Third Force between East and West ? Snapped der Alte : Of course not , no need for it . De Gaulle had never even discussed such thoughts with him ; besides , West Germany is opposed to such a policy . <P> Running out of steam-and questions - Erhard looked around the room for support from Foreign Minister Gerhard Schroder and Defense Minister Kai-Uwe von Hassel . They , like Erhard , are pro-British , and like Erhard , have grave reservations about Adenauer 's comradeship with De Gaulle . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found a sudden fascination in his thumbnails ; Von Hassel shuffled papers . <P> Neglected Conscience . Next day , at a caucus of the ruling Christian Democrats and their allies , Adenauer chided Erhard mercilessly for presuming to seek control of the government . When the Cabinet finally voted on Adenauer 's demand that the Franco-German pact be ratified immediately , Erhard 's nein was overwhelmingly defeated . <P> For the Chancellor , there was now only the Bundestag to be dealt with . Konrad Adenauer , 87 , handled the situation with deft ease . The Franco-German treaty " is not a substitute for European integration , " he told the assembled legislators . " It is merely one of the essential prerequisites . " As a matter of fact , declared der Alte , De Gaulle " promised me that the first subject of joint consultation after the treaty goes into effect will be British entry " into the Common Market . As for the Atlantic alliance , " Europe knows that it can not defend itself without the support of the United States . I underline again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framework of NATO . "
