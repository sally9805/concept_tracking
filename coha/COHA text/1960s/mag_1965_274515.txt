In his 21 years as a Democratic Senator from Massachusetts , Teddy Kennedy has established himself as a pleasant young man who listens respectfully to his elders . But last week Teddy talked back-and , though he narrowly lost his first major legislative test , he handled himself with a skill and a cool political opportunism that bodes well for his future . <P> Lost Sheep . Teddy was the leader of a band of Senate liberals attempting to tack onto the voting-rights bill an amendment to outlaw poll taxes in state and local elections . The move was strongly opposed by President Johnson . Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach , Senate Democratic Leader Mike Mansfield , and Senate Republican Leader Everett Dirksen , who questioned the constitutionality of Teddy 's amendment . <P> Teddy helped mobilize labor and church groups behind the amendment , enlisted Harvard Law Professor Paul Freund to tutor him in the constitutional issues , spent hours on the telephone with such colleagues as New York 's Jacob Javits , his chief Republican ally , and did personal lobbying in the corridors . Brother Bobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amendment , but he worked actively behind the scenes for it . For the opposition , Dirksen set about swinging wavering Republicans back into line . His technique differs considerably from the arm-twisting tactics made famous by Lyndon Johnson . " Senator Dirksen does n't work this way , " explained New Jersey Republican Clifford Case , who supported the amendment . " He takes a little longer . He does it with oleaginous applications of one sort or another . " On the eve of the vote , Dirksen felt certain that his applications had been effective . " I brought three lost sheep back into the fold , " he confided , " and I 'll get another one tomorrow morning . " <P> Clan Within . When the showdown came , the Kennedy clan was on hand in force . Watching from the Senate gallery were Teddy 's wife , Joan , in a pink frock ; Sister Eunice Shriver ; and Bobby 's wife , Ethel . Temporarily presiding over the session was Bobby himself . Taking the floor against the amendment , Dirksen asked : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon that they can not impose a poll tax , why not tell them they can not impose a cigarette tax or any other tax ? " Democratic Leader Mansfield worried that the amendment might endanger the entire voting-rights bill . " The choice , " he said , " is between the course of risk and the course of sureness . " <P> <P> Teddy was neither awed nor swayed . Wearing a navy-blue suit with a PT-boat tie clasp , and leaning on a silver-headed cane , he arose at the front-row desk next to Mansfield 's , which he had appropriated for the occasion , and speaking from notes , defended the first major item of legislation he had ever managed on the floor . " It is a settled constitutional doctrine , " orated Teddy , by way of rationalizing a universal ban on poll taxes , " that where Congress finds an evil to exist , such as the economic burden in this case , it can apply a remedy which may affect people outside the evil .
