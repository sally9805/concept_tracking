 | Ma and the rest of the family unpinned his body from the ground , and we lowered him into the shallow grave dug by Caroline and filled it in , which took quite a few shovelfuls , as I recall , to cover the end of his nose . Nearby , Dutch Katy was performing the same service for Dutch Rudy . She was wearing a fresh dress and her fair hair was dark with wet : it was plain she had already been down to the river for her bath . I wo n't say I never saw a dirty German , but the clean ones go to an excess . Now we was just finished putting our menfolk under the sod , when someone looked ul , and shrieked like a crow , and there was the ( : hcvenne coining down the rise . There was now but three of them , Old Lodge Skins and two braves , the latter each leading four riderless ponies . ' I hev sinwcd no preparation for violence , but this second appearance was too notch for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to veil and crv . Back under the wagon went Tom and Bill . Caroline was the exception . I remember while grabbing onto her bony hips in ntvv own fright , looking up at her face I observed a rather kern look about the nostrils like a horse 's when he smells water . The other two , with their herd , stayed back some thirty yards while Old Lodge Skins rode forward on his brown-and-white pinto , which had painted rings around the eyes . He put up his hand and orated for about fifteen minutes in a queer falsetto . His plug hat was a little more crushed than yesterday but otherwise he appeared in perfect shape . It was strange how in no time at all everybody went from fear to being excruciatingly bored , and the very women who yesterday had been helpless victims and just minutes earlier were howling in fright , now began to advance on him threatening with their fists and saying : " Git on out of here , you old skunk ! " Which shows something about the way a female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as it is interesting , but bore her and she do n't know fear . But Caroline spoke up . " Settle down , now , " said she , swaggering out in front of the crowd . " Do n't you understand they come back for me ? That 's what the horses is for , to pay for hauling me off . You noticed yesterday , did n't you , that I was n't touched while all that nasty business was being done to you ? They was saving me , was what they was doing . " My sister 's cheeks were a deal more  | ddy than the sun could be held accountable for , and she was . ing around her copper hair like the flies was at her face . " Now , you 'd better let them take me , " she went on , " unless you nt to get kilt like the men . " " But Caroline , " Ma asked plaintively , " what in the world do they Want you for ? " " Probly torture me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought it a strange thing to boast about , myself , but held my peace , because what I could see was that my sister reminded me of nobody so much as my Pa . That poor thing was determined to be extravagant . The Widow Walsh then said : " Ah , go on , then . I ai n't stopping them , " and turned away , the rest of the women with her . They had st their men and been raped and were stranded in the wilderness , d there was no way back but that by which they had been months coming , so they could hardly be much moved by what happened one girl . Old Lodge Skins was impassively sitting his horse , watching us through droopy eyelids . On the wooden saddle hung his shield , round , made of hide , and adorned with ten black scalps . In place of the blown-up musket he now carried a lance from the shaft of Which dangled a couple more hanks of hair . He was n't a bad-looking dog , or had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ; his braids now were shot with gray and the muscles of his limbs were stringy . It is hard to tell an Indian 's age , but he must have been within smelling distance of seventy . He grew a big nose with a long , hooking sweep to it , and the ends of his mouth had slight upward twists , whereas his eyes was sad . He generally wore a sort of goodnatured melancholy as to expression . You could n't sav he looked dangerous in any wise ; indeed , it was rather Caroline who seemed Wvage at this juncture . She had been a tomboy but was getting on in years , and the men ncvcr took to her back in Evansville except as a pal . She had got a crush on the local blacksmith , a widower of forty , and hung around the forge , but as far as he went was to let her hold a horse 's hoof while he shoed it . Then there was some farmer 's son : I think for a time they spread manure together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them drummers who came and went , of whom it was said they would screw a snake if somebody 'd hold its head , paid her attention  | as a woman . White men had never done much good for her , you see , and now Pa and the others with the wagons had got themselves killed . I mention this to explain Caroline 's peculiar manner at that time . I think she was also humiliated at not having been raped . " Well , Caroline , " said Ma , standing there in her long , washed-out dress and sunbonnet ; she looked like one of them little dolls you can make out of a hollvhock blossom with a bud for its head . My Ma was small , not far over five feet , and I reckon my lifelong shortness is ( Inc to hers . " Well , Caroline , I expect we will have to go back to Laramie . I 'll tell the soldiers and they 'll come to fetch you . " " I would n't grunt on that , " replied Caroline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracks . " " Well , then , " , Ia said , " von roust drop a button now and again , or a piece oI uut ? shits , to lay a trail . " Caroline impatiently scraped the sweat from her forehead and wiped the hand on the butt of her jeans . She believed , I think , that Ma was trying to diminish her danger and self-concocted glory , and the direct result of that was the cooking of my goose . " ; Alai be they wo n't hurt me permanently , " said Caroline . " Maybe they 'll hold ore for ransom . I do n't expect to be murdered , or why would they want hack to come along , too ? " ' I hat awful yr Irinrper , I discovered after a bit , was issuing from my own throat . I fearing my name had set it off . To her credit nry Ma went up to Old Lodge Skins 's horse and begged hits not to take mc , on account of I was her youngest and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but when she was done he beckoned to his followers , who rode in and tied all eight horses to our wagon as if the deal had been closed . Even then the subsequent events aright have failed to transpire had not the Cheyenne hung around for a bit in the hopes they would get a cup of coffee ! Indians simply never understood whites and vice versa . " Bill will take one of the ponies and ride hack for the soldiers fast as he can go , " Ala said , giving Inc a great hug . " Do n't think bad of your Pa , Jack . I lc done the best he could , given his vision . Maybe by taking you and Caroline , the Indians are trying after their own fashion to make up for what they done yesterday . I do n't think they 're bad people , Jack , or they would n't have brung the horses . " There you had it . Nobody thought to ask Caroline how she knew what the Cheyenne were up to without speaking their language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspected my Ma actually wanted to get rid of us , because the soldiers never came ; which was before I found out , some years on , that Bill rode back to Laramie , sold the horse , . , dot a job with the traders , and not only never reported about us to the Army but also never rejoined the wagons . No , my Ma was wellmeaning but ignorant . My Pa was crazy and my brother was a traitor . Then there was Caroline . They were n't much of a family , I guess , but then I was not with them long . Ma give us each a kiss , and Caroline mounted one of the ponies brought by the Indians , pulling me up behind . The other kids waved in silence , Bill with a dirty , scared grin . Old Lodge Skins , dawdling about nearby on his horse , grunted quizzically and covered his lips . I did n't know then that this is how Indians show astonishment  --  their mouth falls open and they cover it so their soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave evidence of wanting to make another speech , but Caroline motioned him to come on , dug her heels into the mount , which was skittish owing to its unfamiliarity with white hindquarters , and we went off like a cannon shot , heading north . At top of the rise , she pulled in on the rawhide bridle and waited for the three Cheyenne , who were n't in no hurry , I 'll say that for them . Then we rode on down to the river , which was yellow and swollen from the spring rains , and swam the ponies across , I holding onto the tail of ours and spinning behind like a lure on a fishline.  | page deleted  | page deleted  | and swum his pony over , and the other went upstream for about a mile , then the river took a bend and he went around it out of sight . I guess he knew a better place . We did n't see him again for an hour , until we conic over a rise , and there he sat on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed him without so much as a look , and the brave returned the compliment . The latter started singing , though , in an awful moaning fashion that we could hear for a long time thereafter , when so far off he looked like a tiny bush . After I had lived some time with the Cheyenne and learned their peculiarities , I renumbered that incident and realized that the fellow had been in a " mood . " Something had offended him  --  maybe the river crossing he used had turned out to be full of quicksand or a frog on the shore called hint an insulting name  --  and he moped along full of depression , and deciding to ( lie , he sat down and began to sing his death song . In the old days before the coming of the whites , other than in battle Indians never kicked off except from shame . But the white men brought a number of diseases  --  like smallpox , which wiped out the entire Mandan nation  --  and that took the point away from dying for moral reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although some willful individuals like our friend might try upon occasion . Apparently it did n't work this time because I saw the same fellow next date in camp , where he was peering into a little trade mirror and plucking out facial hair with a bone tweezer . His vanity had got the upper hand , so he must have recovered by then . The riding got somewhat easier because the chief proceeded in a slow walk and every half mile or so stopped altogether , turned to us , and made certain hand signals accompanied by noises in his heathen tongue  --  communications which ( ; ar dine interpreted as statements of admiration for herself and suchlike rot . Then he would stare sadly at us for a minute and head on . Now I better explain part of the secret at this point , as long as you understand what neither Old Lodge Skins nor me got the hang of it until quite a spell afterward . As to Caroline , well , it 's useless to speculate about'what she thought she knew or what she imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The main thing was that the chief had not made a deal to buy me and Caroline back at the wagons . What he done instead was make a long statement on the massacre , excusing the Cheyenne from any responsibility for it ; but to be decent , because he liked white men  | still at this time and he also figured to get blamed when the story reached the troops at Laramie , he brought them horses to pay for the men that were killed . So there we were , what with Caroline 's taste for romance and the gift for jumping to conclusions she inherited from our Pa , trailing Old Lodge Skins across the prairie under a terrible misapprehension . ' I he chief thought we was following him to get more reparation and the speeches he made at them stops was to protest against the injustice of our hounding him like coyotes , who will sometimes follow you for miles . Caroline stared at him in love , and that poor Indian interpreted it as the look of ruthless extortion . In later years I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more bad luck than any human being I have ever known , red or white , and you ca n't beat that for making a man likable . As I say , none of us understood the situation , but me and Caroline was considerably better off than the chief , because we only looked to him for our upkeep in the foreseeable future , whereas he at last decided we was demons and only waiting for dark to steal the wits from his head ; and while riding along he muttered prayers and incantations to bring us bad medicine , but so ran his luck that he never saw any of the animal brothers that assisted his magic  --  such as Rattlesnake or Prairie Dog  --  but rather only Jackrabbit , who had a grudge against him of long standing because he once had kept a prairie fire off his camp by exhorting it to burn the hares ' homes instead . Which it did , turning away from his lodges after coming so close the tepee-skins was scorched . Ever since that incident the rabbits all knew him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous hind legs and say : " We think bad thoughts for you . " They would also call him by his real name , which is as malicious as you can get , and go bounding off , showing white or black tail as the case may be , for both families had it in for that particular Indian . And I 'll say this : I never in my life saw more examples of that animal than when in the company of Old Lodge Skins . Let the toe of his moccasin protrude from the tepee , and up they 'd leap for miles about , numerous as sparks when you throw a horseshoe in the forge . But the one defense a redskin has against the kind of harassment me and Caroline was , unbeknownst to us , dealing to our host is loss  | of interest . If an Indian ca n't accomplish his purpose with reasonable haste , it bores hell out of him and he will forget it immediately . He is interested only in a going proposition . So with Old Lodge Skins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which under a hot sun kept him cooler than had he exposed his naked back , and rode on as if he was the only living individual north of the River Platte . The third brave ( counting as second the fellow sitting back a ways under the illusion he was dying ) specialized in being always a half a mile oil , to the left , right , or ahead . I guess he was looking both for enemies and something to cat . At any given time the Cheyenne was over-furnished with the first and had too little of the second . In such fashion we proceeded towards the Cheyenne camp , which I reckon to have been not more than ten mile , as the arrow flies , from the Platte in a direction north by northeast ; but it took our little p:trt three or four hours to get there , owing to the chief 's warped manner of navigating so as to discourage me and Caroline . The sun still held itself a hand 's width above the horizon , but the prairie underhoof was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can fix his look on a square foot of turf , never turning to the sky , and tell you the hour of day at any moment from the general cast of light upon it . I mean a white man . An Indian do n't keep that sort of time because he ai n't , in the white sense , ever going anywhere . You can imagine Columbus saying , " I better get started : it 's 1492 and I got to get across the ocean blue before midnight on I ) eccnther 3tst or else America wo n't be discovered till ' 93 , " but a redskin computes in another fashion . The signlanguage term for " day " is the same as for " sleep . " Now , looking at a patch of earth , an Indian would see which animals had stepped there during the past two weeks , what birds had flown overhead , and how far it was to the nearest water  --  this in addition to a lot of supernatural stuff , because he does not separate the various types of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Lodge Skins went along in a coma , I mean as far as we were concerned . He knew where he was , all right , and at one point caught the attention of the scouting brave  --  whose name I might as well give : Burns Red in the Sun  --  pointed ahead to rising ground , and showed a hooked finger . Burns Red traveled in from the left flank and slipped off his pony , undoing the single rein of the  | rawhide war bridle from his belt and tying it to a lance which he drove into the earth . He dropped his blanket and stripped off his leggings . In his brecchclout and carrying bow and arrows , he snuck up the long swell of which we others waited at the foot , flopping to his belly just before the point of divide . The grass hereabout had been trampled flat by a great herd of buffalo and not long before , it not having sprung back yet , and you could see him snaking all the way until his moccasin soles tipped up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him to us , the thunnng , thunnng of two arrows leaving the bowstring , a rush of little hoofs , and then Old Lodge Skins trotted up and over , me and Caroline naturally hard behind . There , squatting at a buffalo wallow half filled with water , was Burns Red in the Sun . Alongside him lay a pronghorn antelope whose panting throat he was iii the act of cutting , the animal having been felled but not killed by a shaft to the left haunch . The other shot had missed altogether ; still , Burns Red had done a nice piece of work , creeping to within fifty feet of the little pack , the remaining four of which were now at the distance of a quarter mile and still going . That creature can run . The next thing Burns Red did was to cut off that black and white rosette of tail from the antelope 's behind , which he would keep for decoration , it being a cunning little item . Then he slit open its chest at the division between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the gory heart , hot and still palpitating . This he shoved at me . At the sight of that dripping offal , I shivered off , but Burns Red seized my nape with one hand and pushed the heart in my mouth with the other . That was actually a mark of preference , for he was mighty fond of fresh antelope heart himself , to which he owed his prowess as swiftest runner in Old Lodge Skins 's band , but of course I did n't know that then . However , I was scared of Burns Red in the Sun , who had the peculiarity mentioned in his name , as many Indians do though some others are almost black , and to protect his cheeks he daubed them with a coat of clay that dried a wolfish graywhite , from which his eyes peered little and glittering like a serpent 's . So I gnawed off a hunk of bloody heart , which was not the easiest work owing to the stringy vessels that run through it , and he relieved me of the rest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully swallowed the raw morsel , the taste of which I can only describe as live and fleet . Immediately the calf-muscles of  | my legs started to hum like plucked bowstrings and I felt I could have caught the wind had not we all mounted again , Burns Red with the antelope carcass leaking gore on the rump of his pony , where he toted it . Old Lodge Skins had detected the beasts on the other side of the hill , though there was no way he could have seen them . He had a gift for that sort of thing , which was unusually acute even for an Indian . The way he knew was having dreamed it . He was dreaming as he rode along that day , right in the middle of the prairie . He did n't need nighttime or even to fall asleep . Not long after shooting the antelope we arrived at the Cheyenne camp , which had located on a little creek about as wide as a gunstock and was shaded by no more than three cottonwood , two of which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so as to give than time to identify us as ourselves rather than Crow come to run off the Cheyenne ponies . Old Lodge Skins was full of such courtesies  --   --  which is what this could be called , because nobody around that camp was ever alert for intruders ; at least once a week they were successfully raided by horse thieves from enemy tribes , sometimes in broad daylight . What could Ice seen from the knoll was as follows : a couple of dozen hide tepees , pitched on the right bank of the stream . In the meadow beyond , a pony herd of some thirty head . In the water itself , a nuniher of giggling , bare-arsed brown children slapping water at one another . A bunch of able-bodied young men sitting around smoking and fanning themselves with eagle feathers , a few others strutting up and down wearing finery before a group of womenfolk pounding something on the ground . A couple of young girls towing in from the prairie a buffalo robe full of the stacked dry dung of the saute animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being there was little wood available . A heavy-set female chewing soft a hunk of hide . Others going for water and hauling bundles and mending lodge skins and making moccasins , sewing leggings , fringing shirts , ntarrowing hones , grinding berries , stitching beads , and the rest of the duties to which an Indian woman gives herself from dawn until she lies on her robe at night and her man mounts her . As we come down to the creek nobody in camp paid the slightest notice , but when Burns Red in the Sun , who rode last , splashed across with the antelope slung behind , it created quite a stir among  | the women . I found out later that band had n't had a bite of meat for shout ten days and was feeding on prairie turnips and old rawhide and considering the chewing of grasshoppers like the Paiutes , which to an Indian is about as low as you can get . This was in late spring , when in those days the plains were ordinarily hairy with buffalo , and if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole had been beaten down by a great herd . Yet Old Lodge Skins 's bunch had n't ate flesh for more than a week . That 's what I mean about their bad luck . Now a special mention to their dogs . Little as the band was , they had thirty or more mongrels , the prevailing color of which was pusvellow though every other hue was also represented , including a good many of the spotted variety . This crowd kept up a constant din at all times , snarling , barking , howling , quarreling among themselves , so that they were generally worthless as watchmen , even in the nights , which they would spend answering the coyotes who wailed from the bluffs while the Pawnee snuck in and cut out a dozen ponies without drawing a growl . These dogs met us at the creek , swarming among the horses ' legs and jumping at the antelope 's head as it swung lifeless above them . But they was also wary of the rawhide quirt strapped to Burns Red 's left wrist , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tail , so though they clamored and snapped their fangs , they did n't actually bite nothing . The secret to enduring an Indian dog is to ignore his noise ; he has n't got much worse . I did n't learn that right off , and had some bad times , as right now : there was one dirty white dog , with red eyes and a slavering mouth , who decided to give me his preference over the antelope carcass . He crouched below our pony 's left haunch , and while studying my face , slowly rolled back his upper lip at the same time as his lower jaw fell away , making all in all a very savage exhibition of yellow ivory . Caroline had to elbow me in the ribs so as to draw breath , I was hugging her that tight . " Now do n't shame me before our friends , Jack , " said she , straining to smile at the Cheyenne women crowding round , none of whom however give us yet a glance . I believe at that point Caroline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what exactly she had thought she was getting into , but at the first sight of an Indian camp the stoutest heart is likely to quail . Without experience of them , you tend to think : well , I see their dump , but where 's the  | town ? And the smell alone is very queer : it is n't precisely a stench as white people know one , but a number of stinks melding together into a sort of invisible fog that replaces the air , so that with every breath you draw in all the facts of life concerning mankind and the four-footed animals . Right now it had a principal odor , owing to our pony staling under its at the very moment . Except in the case of such a particular event nearby , no smells predominated . You was just completely itt another type of existence from the first minute your kings filled with that atmosphere . But , like anything else , living in it made it your reality , and when next I entered a w bite settlement , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and felt I would suffocate . Burns Red in the Sun dismounted and stalked proudly around camp , leaving the throng of women to dispose of the antelope , which they fell on and skinned in the time it takes to fill and light a pipe , and began to butcher with like speed . As to Old Lodge Skins , he walked his puny to a big but shabby tepee the cover of which , in between where it was patched , bore faded blue-and-yellow drawings  - -  stick- men , scratchy animals , triangle-mountains , button-suns , and the like got down , handed the single rein to a boy who was standing there in a leather breechclout and nothing else but moccasins , and ducking almost to his knees so his plug hat would clear and holding it besides , went in through the entrance hole . " This here , " say 's my sister Caroline , " I believe , is home . " What I could sec of her face when she turned in the saddle , looked definitely peaked . " But , " she went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . him iniluors ? That 's the question . " " Caroline , " I answered , " I am raw and sore from this riding , and my Pa is dead and my Ma is far away , and that white dog is still alongside watering at the mouth . I am scared to get down . " At that sonic of my sister 's spirit returned . " I sure wo n't let a dirty little dog stop me , " she said with heat , and having flipped her leg over the saddle , raking me with a boothcel in the process , she dropped to the ground . The dog ignored her utterly . Taking her cue from the chief , she also give her rein to the Indian kid , who was staring at me out of his bright black eyes . For racial reasons I did n't take to him , but I jerked my thumb at the dog , who was waiting for nothing in the world but my coming down where it could conveniently get at me.  | Being a shrewd lad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot in e rump that sent it whining off . So added to my natural bias tinst him was that favor , and I hopped to the ground with my ) se lifted and on the strength of spite trailed Caroline as she took a g gulp of air and entered the lodge . It was marvelously dark in there , coming from the outdoor brightness of afternoon , and whatever you could see owed to the resence of a little buffalo-chip fire in the center of the floor and tell light as fell through the smokehole at the top of the cone . Now the outside smell was remarkably ripe , you could never recall it after one whiff of indoors a tepee , where it was like trying to breathe underwater in a swamp . After a while I could make out a stout woman stirring a pot over the fire , but she did n't lift her head at us . All round the circumference of the lodge were dark forms , their heads against the skin wall and feet pointing towards the middle , which closer inspection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was so dark we had to traipse from one to another , never knowing but that the next might be occupied by some savage who might take the intrusion very ill . We had half-circled the fire before locating Old Lodge Skins , whose bed was directly opposite the door . He was sitting silent there , and Caroline almost fell over him , catching herself at the last minute on a tepee pole from which was dangling a number of skin bags and bundles containing such few private possessions as an Indian owns . The chief held a stone pipe which had a wooden shank a foot and a half in length and was decorated with a series of brass tacks that winked in the firelight . We just stood watching him , on account of having no place else to go . He filled his pipe bowl from a little leather pouch and then the stout woman put a stick in the fire until it caught and blew it into a burning coal , fetching it to him , who thereupon lighted up , sucking so hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the length of the stem , it was powerful hard to keep one of them pipes going , but he got it to where he was satisfied , then all at once shoved it towards Caroline . My sister , mannish as she tended to be , however had not smoked nor chewed her life long . She admired the pipe kindly and passed it back to Skins . The chief correctly supposed she did n't savvy what was wanted , and indicated with his fingers she should sit down upon  | the buffalo robe at his right . Then Old Lodge Skins leaned across and placed the end of the stem in her mouth , while mimicking with his own lips the action of smoking . Caroline accepted the mouthpiece and went to puffing according to Old Lodge Skins 's model . Of course , to her this , I believe , was . , type of sexual ritual or the like . " l'Ite chief , however , was muttering incantations against what he thought was her bad medicine directed at him , and the fact that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charms would work , because an Indian holds by smoking above all things . Old Lodge Skins finally took the device away when it got to where she was expelling only a thin vapor , and Caroline gasped and chewed awhile on her neckerchief . She was panting for a goodly time after , but never passed out and did n't puke . Caroline was a pretty tough old girl . The chief nuw lonscued the ashes in the pipe bowl and poured them out on the toes of Caroline 's boots , so as to give her bad luck , only , we did n't know that at the time . Then he stoked up again from his beaded pouch with what was actually in small part tobacco , the rest being made up of red-willow bark , sumac leaves , the marrow front bntltlo hones , and several other ingredients . Indians of course invented the habit of smoking , and almost nothing else . By the time he had smoked his own bowl out , Old Lodge Skins changed his whole style . He grinned , he spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he said something to the woman at the fire that was apparently orders , for she left directly and come back with a fresh hunk of antelope from the carcass earlier referred to . This moon-faced woman hacked up the flesh and throwed it in the pot with the mess already simmering there . I figure it was on account of the smell that while the meal was cooking a bunch of Indians began to show up at the tepee . First come that boy who took the horses , anti then another stoutish woman who from the back was a dead ringer for the cook , and a tiny , girl wearing not a stitch and a slightly bigger lad likewise ; next appeared a fine tall fellow about twenty-five years of age ; and finally Burns Red in the Sun , the breadwinner himself , still in his mask of clay , and just behind him a procession beginning with a slender woman with a great fall of loosely braided black hair and eyes soft as a doe . Three or four kids followed her , the oldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lodge wall and had  | eyes for nothing but that pot . Most of them brought their own wooden bowls and some had spoons of the same or else horn . They never uttered a sound , and not once did they so much as glance at me and Caroline . After a bit the cook ladled out a bowl each for my sister and me , and then the others gathered around and got theirs . Old Lodge Skins did n't eat a thing , just sat there on his buffalo hides and looked grand . Now it happened that I remembered how the redskins that had come to our wagons always said " How , how " when they ate biscuit and drank coffee . I still felt mighty uneasy about the whole situation , and though I was terrible hungry , that meal did very little for my peace of mind : it was pretty strong , I 'll tell you . The antelope chunks were n't too well done . Indians do n't have a prejudice against grease , on the one hand ; and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days to using salt . Along with the meat was some chokecherries all cooked to a mush , and a root or two that did n't have a taste until you swallowed it and it fell all the way to your belly and gave off the aftereffect of choking on sand . But , as I say , I recalled that courteous remark and put it . I wanted them people to like me . They were n't paying no attention to us yet , but I had seen how Indians could change . " How , how , how , " said I , t right to Old Lodge Skins . It took a bit of nerve . Caroline give me a poke , but the chief was considerably pleased . In fact , he shot it right back at me , " How , how , " and then spoke something that turned out , after I learned to parley in Cheyenne , to be my first Indian name : Little Antelope , which was Voka in that lingo and sounded like a cough . As a name it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , but was a start . At least I had n't been scalped for uttering the sentiment , which I had considered not unlikely , for you probably ai n't got no conception of what it resembles to be a boy of ten newly joined a pack of barbarians . And Caroline got a favor , because while the chief was grinning at me , I saw her fish a big hunk of meat from her bowl and slip it outside under the tepee skin , where a dog could be heard to gnaw it up straightway , because you never find a nook or cranny in an Indian camp that do n't have a dog right at hand . I figure it was the colorful aspect of the Indians , along with their cruelty , that she had been attracted by back at the wagons ; but the longer we stayed with Old Lodge Skins , the more commonplace the  | life of a savage seemed . For it is true that an Indian can slaughter a person one minute and the next sit down to his grub as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make the separation between the various endeavors that a white man does . Indians are altogether different from anybody you ever knew . Next thing , the chief said a word to the cook  --  because as he admitted later , his feelings towards us was really mixed : we would appear to hint by turns benign and malevolent . Right then he was kindly disposed to us on account of our breaking bread , or rather antelope , in his tepee , which does an Indian so much honor that the host never takes a bite till his guests are finished ; that 's the reason Old Lodge Skins himself was n't eating . As I say , the chief gave word to the cook and she beckoned to me to come along with her , which I did in sonic apprehension and passed while making the halfcircle of the lodge all then ) Cheyenne chewing like goats . When we r1l got outside through the door hole , the sky was about half along towards dark witls great purple smears in the west , separated each from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was not awfully interested in scenery at that age , and the reason I was looking to the sky could be laid to the reappearance , no sooner than my head cleared the tepee flap , of my enemy that- white dog . I was trying to ignore him , but he seized my trouser cuff and proceeded to thaw on it , and he might have ate me up had not t he woman looked back at that point . She was Buffalo Wallow Woman , Old Lodge Skins 's wife , and the other inside who favored her was her younger sister , White Cow Wonsan , who according to the Cheyenne practice had come along with her kin when the latter married and was obliged in the same degree as the proper wife to make herself available to the chief for all the purposes ose  --  s t s to which an Indian puts a female . Anyway , Buffalo Wallow Woman laughed , and pointing at the dog , put a question to me . Taking my tearful look as sufficient answer , she picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him nothing . For directly Buffalo Wallow Woman carried him inside the tepee , where she busted his skull with a stone hammer , rolled him through the fire to singe his hair , chopped the carcass to a number of bleeding hunks , then into a kettle they went to boil . This was the work of as many moments as it takes to tell it , for she was a plump and powerful soul , and smiling all the while .  | Old Lodge Skins was looking proud enough to bust . There is n't any better eating to an Indian than dog , and white dog is the very best of that . To show you how high they regard this victual , they had had no fresh meat for more than a week yet forbore from touching their dog pack . I 'm afraid that me and Caroline failed to understand the honor we was being done at that juncture . My sister stood fast at the massacre of people , including her own Pa , but when it come to seeing that ugly dog butchered before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs and try to swallow her fist . That was when Old Lodge Skins all at once looked at Caroline and sneezed so hard his plug hat slipped down over one eye . He sneezed again , and off it fell entirely . Twice more he spasmed in his big nose  --  it sounded like the barking of a fox  --  and his braids flew and his medal leaped up , falling back with a thank against his breastbone . Now the whole pack left off stuffing grub down their gullets and gawked at us like they should have when we first appeared but I guess failed to because , having minds of one track , they was fascinated with the prospect of eating that antelope . The pretty woman with the doe eyes went so far as to come and set right on Caroline 's very buffalo skin and peer incessantly at my sister , who had all she could put up with just in trying not to vomit on account of the white dog , who you could already smell in the steam from the pot , sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dry . Shooting Star was that woman 's name and she was the wife of Burns Red in the Sun and had give birth to the several children she had brought to the chief 's tepee , including one tiny baby in a cradleboard hanging from a lodgepole , who had beady little black eyes like a bird . His contraption was arranged so he could water without being took out of the sling . The curiosity of Shooting Star served to take Caroline 's mind off the perturbations of her stomach , and she summoned her st - ? th to say : " Right proud to meet you , Mrs. , " offering one of he aws to shake on it . But what the Indian woman did instead ' each into the fork of my sister 's jeans and feel there , then the same with the chest of her shirt . Concluding which , she spoke one word to Old Lodge Skins : " Vehoa ! " and clapped a hand over her own mouth . *  | Sooner or later an Indian will sneeze when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is due to perfume or talcum powder , but I never saw my sister use anything on herself but yellow soap . However you want to explain it , that was the first time any of the Cheyenne knew Caroline for a girl .  | TIii DIFFERENCE BETWEEN men and women is very important to the Cheyenne  --  more so than the distinction of the dead from the living , as a matter of fact  --  and they was satisfied to have established it insofar as my sister went . Besides , the antelope was all ate up at that moment and the dog was n't quite ready . So the rest of the Indians come crowding round us to exercise their curiosity . This was mannerly by their lights . They restricted themselves to peering , for the most part ; and some handled our clothing , but never touched flesh . I believe could we have understood Shooting Star 's remarks , we would have heard her in so many words apologize to Caroline for the laying on of hands  --  which was justified by the facts derived from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it always seemed marvelous to me that savages was not inconsiderate except through ignorance . Particular attention was of course paid me by the kids . Little 1 iorse , that boy who had cared for the ponies  --  I sure made a big hit with him from the first . As I have said , I did not take to him ; but even at that age I was shifty , had to be , else I would n't have survived a decade let alone more than a century , and so when I saw him admiring my boots , I stripped them off quick and offered to hand them over . But the thought of confining his feet in such fashion is one of the many things that scares an Indian , so he pretended not to get the purpose . The dog was served up directly . Fortunately it was a small animal and had to go around to many eaters , although as guests me and Caroline got the largest chunks . The Cheyenne proceeded to stay up to midnight , it must have been . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went , new individuals entered the lodge and in-  | spected my sister and me , certain Indians rolled up in their buffalo robes and went to sleep right alongside groups of others chattering and laughing ( for contrary to white opinion nobody is more socia ble than a redskin when among his own ) . Some sort of activity continued for hours during which the fire continued to blaze : the women , for instance , went about their chores and Old Lodge Skins smoked four or five pipefuls with divers of his cronies . One of the latter was I lump , of all people , who other than a big scab on his nose looked very fit and grunted at me and Caroline in a friendly manner . I do n't know whether or not he recognized us from the clay before , but he was very decent about not blaming us for his having eonunitted rapine and murder  --  - which is how an Indian would look at it . As to Caroline , she sat on her robe in pretty much of a daze from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog in the same spirit . Old Lodge Skins paid her no more attention at all . He was n't insulting , just not interested . At length the fire dwindled because Buffalo Wallow Woman was n't throwing any more chips on it , having gone to a well-deserved bed if I ever saw one . As I found out the next day , me and Caroline had hers , next to that of Old Lodge Skins ; so she displaced one of her kids further on , and so it went around the circle like nmsical chairs until my admirer Little Horse was short man and had to go next door to the tepee of his brother , who was none other than Burns Red in the Sun . I  --  vcntually nn ? sister and me was sitting there alone looking at the dying fire , from which the smoke dumb in a skinny thread to the hole at the junction of the lodgepoles and there met the night , a sky colored dark blue , rather than black , by virtue of a dust of yellow stars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmurless rest , his hat dangling overhead front a rawhide line , the silhouette of his big beak pointing up in the perpendicular . You could hear a number of strong breathings but no snores , on account of Indians are trained from birth not to make noise when here ai n't a purpose to it . Also a faint sifting now and again as a last piece of buffalo dung dissolved into ash . It was queer to be there , but speaking for myself no longer scary . You may think the worse of me , away from my home such as it had been and my father killed and all , but I had begun to feel as though  | was n't so desperate . It was warm in that lodge and the people had ncd out to be tolerant . If they had n't offered us violence that Or , I could n't figure them doing it next day : you do n't feed a fellow by dark and then murder him next morning . On the other hand , though , you could n't get away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penny for your thoughts , Caroline , " says I to the slumped figure of my kin , whose jaw was in her splayed hands and whose hat was way down to her fanned ears . She appeared very glum in the shadow , and her voice sounded in the same vein . " Savages ai n't much of a lot , Jack , " she answers , inconsiderately loud , I thought , with her hosts trying to catch their sleep . " See how they done in that little dog ? Following which they was feeling me ss if maybe I was next for the pot , though I never heard Indins was cannibals . I do n't think you can count on them , Jack . " With a grunt she struggled to get her soles to the ground , which ai n't the easiest thing when you have had your rump on it for some hours with your legs crossed . She repeated almost the same remark , with a significant difference that did not strike me at the time : " You better not count on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door flap  --  I figured , to go relieve herself before bedding down for the night . For myself , I 0 determined to hold it till morning because of being scared of the roaming dogs outside . Well , that was the last I saw of Caroline for a time . She went over to the meadow , cut a pony out of the herd , rode away , and it was years before I ran into her again , which event we will come to in order . Meanwhile , you have to understand I considered her for a spell as missing and then forgot about her altogether . Nobody could say I owed her more . I probably could have heard the hoofbeats as she fled had I not fell asleep directly , there being little else in the way of wrapping so cozy as a buffalo robe when you get the hang of it . Though at first it tends to be stiff on the skinned side , whereas the hair on the other is rough as a brush , it soon cleaves to the body from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on yourself . Next thing I knowed , that young boy Little Horse woke me up in the dawn . " Come on , " he indicated ; and shivering off the remains of my sleep , which was n't hard to do because of the cold of that time of morning , I followed him out to the field where the ponies was  | pastured . There was markedly fewer than when I had seen the herd the day before : Caroline 's theft of one was nothing to what some Ute had come and stole a little later on , or maybe it was the Pawnee this time . Anyway , unless Old Lodge Skins 's crowd went out soon and stole some horses hack , they would all be walking . Little I horse already knowed , as an Indian would , that Caroline had run off and figured correctly that I was going to stay and be part of the tribe , having no alternative , and he had woke me to go with him because that was the duty of the boys of my age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to say , he knew more about me than I did nn'self at that moment , but his grin was in no wise mocking or mean as we left the tepecful of sleeping Cheyenne grownups . Indians do n't rise especially early when nothing 's doing , except fur the hoes . Outside the dawn was blue , and chill to go with it . I had n't had one particle of ntv clothes off for a couple days , and not washed for the same space of time , enjoying my deficiency . I mention that because I recall thinking about it and feeling luxurious . Even as a small boy , a white man gets that sort of idea when he goes among Indians : What the hell does anything matter ? I 'm with savages , do n't have to wash , can go to the toilet right where I stand , and so on . M1y point here is that , on the contrary , a Cheyenne takes a bath every day in the nearest water , and even if they had n't observed that custom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . If you 're a human being , you ca n't get away from obligations . On the route to the meadow , me and Little Horse encountered various other lads going to the same chore , aged eight to twelve ; and on account of the thefts , there was so few ponies left that the herdsmen almost outnumbered the stock . Our job turned out to be leading the animals to the creek for watering . After which we took them to a new pasturage , for they had ate quite a bit of grass from the old one , and after all , the plains belonged to us far as the eye could see . Little Horse and the other boys did a lot of gassing and laughing among themselves , and for all I know it might have been at my expense . I was alone insofar as wearing pants , shirt , boots , and hat ; but after we rehobbled the lead mare to keep the herd from straying and went back to the creek and stripped down to take that bath I mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we come back out of the water  --  which was fairly cold to start with but  | Warmed once you were in , especially because of the horseplay that ' Indian boys give a lot of time to  --  why , I left off all my duds except the wool pants . Gave everything away , in fact , which made me a lot of immediate friends . When we got back to the lodges , the recipients went inside and brought out Cheyenne stuff in return . That was when I finally took off the pants and got into the buckskin breechclout that one of the boys give me , and secured it with the belt I had from another . Also rut on moccasins ; and received a dirty yellow blanket from a tall id named Younger Bear , who accepted my trousers and straightway amputated them for use as unjoined leggings , throwing aside the waist and seat . Nobody had use for the boots , which just laid there on the ground and were left behind in the same position when the camp moved away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not so much as see it , will stumble over it repeatedly without ever considering he might kick it aside . We never did get breakfast that first morning , for the simple reason that there was n't any food to be had . The antelope had been ate up totally the night before , and they could n't afford to do in no more dogs for a spell , seeing as how the ponies was fast disappearing and a certain number of pack animals was required when camp moved . Also Caroline had not returned  --  for I still thought she might be back at that point ; though never once did I entertain the idea she might be killed  --  and I had nobody to jaw with in my own language . But before the sun had got far through the sky , I had learned quite a vocabulary of the sign lingo and conversed with Little Horse on such things as could be expressed with the hands . For example , you want to say " man , " so you put up the index finger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable assisted in learning the lingo by Little Horse 's habit of making the sign , then pointing to the thing itself . The motion for " white man , " a finger wiped across the forehead to suggest the brim of a hat , was somewhat difficult to savvy owing to Little Horse himself wearing the felt hat I had discarded . He kept running his finger along the brim and pointing at me , and I first thought he meant " your hat , " or " you , " before I got it straight . The sign for plain " man " naturally meant " Indian man . " For " Cheyenne " you run the right index finger across the left as though striping it , for the distinctive arrow-guides used by all Cheyenne was made of striped feathers from the wild turkey . By  | the way , in their spoken language Cheyenne do n't ever call themselves " Cheyenne " but rather Tsistsistas , which means " the People , ' or " the Human Beings . " What anybody else is does n't concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we played war in and out of a buffalo wallow near camp , shooting one another with arrows that did n't have no points . And then we did some wrestling , at which I was none too good and somewhat shy to try too hard , but after getting badly squeezed , I turned to boxing and bloodied at least one brown nose . The latter was the property of Younger Bear , and the event caused him to receive a good deal of jeering , because I 'd say Indians are given to that trait even more than whites . I felt sorry for Younger Bear when I saw the ridicule I had let him in for . Which was a big mistake : I should either never have hit him in the first place or after doing so should have strutted around boasting about it and maybe given hint some more punishment to consolidate the advantage : that 's the Indian way . You should never feel sorry about heating anybody , unless having conquered his body you want his spirit as veil . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day I kept trying to shine up to Younger Bear , and the result was I made the first real enemy of my life and he caused me untold trouble for wars , for an Indian will make a profession of revenge . The next thing I remember us boys doing was to go and play camp with a number of little girls . This game is a mimicry of what the grownups do . The girls set up miniature tepees and the boys act like their husbands , going out on war parties and having mock buffalo hunts in which one boy , playing the animal , carries a prickly pear at the end of a stick . The hunters shoot their arrows at this fruit , and are considered to have brung the buffalo down if they strike the target . Whoever misses , the buffalo lad gets to swat on the dl ; hind end with the prickly pear . You can see that whatever the Cheyenne do has a threat of pain in it , if not the realization thereof . In the earlier doings I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so when it came to play camp , and that I believe was due to Younger it Bear , who was by common consent war chief of that establishment on account of he could shoot an arrow exceptionally well and he was very convincing when braining* a make-believe foe with a nastylooking war club he had fashioned himself . That 's the way a man gets to be a war chief among the Cheyenne : he can fight better than anyone else . He is a chief only in battle . For peace they have another kind of leader . You take Old Lodge Skins , he was a peace  | The principal war chief of our bunch was Hump . These Ilows got along fine , except you 'll recall at the whiskey fight as n as they had a few in their belly , they went for each other . lowcver , when Skins 's gun blew up , they forgot about it and went their separate ways . Anyhow , Younger Bear was at about eleven years of age already vcry well advanced towards his true profession , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his chest arched out . I 'll say this about the fight I had with him : he could have killed me except that he knew r nothing about boxing . But his ignorance was n't my responsibility ; I ai n't never been big , but I 'm shrewd . In those first days I was dependent on what the other boys would Icnd me : bow , arrows , and the certain type of stick they ran with between their legs as if it was a pony . But when it came to war games under Younger Bear 's direction , off they 'd ride , even Little Horse , leaving me behind with the girls and the littler kids who were supposed to be the babies of the play camp . Now after them boys did that until it got to be a habit , they started to call me " Antelope Girl , " because there I was , helping to dismantle the toy tepees , which is women 's work . The sun dance was another adult pursuit the children mimicked in play camp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strings to them , and drag around prairie-dog or coyote skulls . I might have got desperate enough to try it myself , had I not already at that early age worked out the following proposition : a white man is better than a redskin , who is a savage . Why is he better ? Because he uses his wits . Centuries earlier the Indians had learned you could move heavy objects by rolling logs under them , yet still by the time I lived among them they had never cut a cross section through one of them logs to make a wheel . You can see that as either invincible ignorance or stubbornness ; whichever , it 's just barbarous . I did go behind one of the play-tepees and experiment with a thorn , but no sooner than the point touched my flesh I turned yellow . I never could get interested in hurting myself . So I got an arrow , stole a real one with an iron trade point , and wore it in two with a jagged rock . Now the Cheyenne make a chewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wallow Woman give me some , but I put it into my belly button rather than my mouth , and stuck in it the end of the arrow shaft that ends with the feathers . The other part , that with the iron head , I fixed so it appeared to  | issue from the cleft of my arse , the breechclout being drawn aside in accommodation . It looked as if I was fairly skewered through the middle , at an angle of forty-five degrees . When I was all prepared , I come out from back of the lodge , walking funny with my rump checks tight , and secretly supporting the feathered end with a hand to my gut as if to catch the pain  --  that was an infraction of the rules , for the idea is to show a manly indifference to the hurt , but I figured the act would be spectacular enough to cover up an inciden tal . I was right . The girls saw me first and slapped their mouths so hard it 's a marvel their front teeth stayed tight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and them tiny animal skulls . In chagrin Coyote ripped his out of his back and throwed it away , and the blood streamed in scarlet ribbons clown to his rump . Little 1 lorse began to dance about and boast how he was my friend . Poor old Younger Bear , he just turned and trudged away , the little skulls trailing along the ground behind him , hopping when they struck a rough , and when one of them caught under a sagebush the rawhide line broke rather than his skin . From here on I was on equal terms in the war games , and before long Burns Red in the Sun made me a little bow . Burns was Old Lodge Skins 's son by one of his earlier wives now dead . My own position turned out to be orphan attached to the chief 's lodge , l which gave me the right to benevolent consideration from the whole family just as if I was related to them by blood . Almost every tepee had a similar lad , though the rest was pure Indians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the men to see I grew up into a man . I do n't recall my race being held against me while I was small . Caroline , for example , was never referred to  --  for one reason , because it was a great shame to Old Lodge Skins that he had smoked a pipe with what turned out a female . In the very old times the Cheyenne would not smoke when a woman was even in the tepee ; they tied up the door to keep them out . Another reason why it was easy for me to melt into that tribe was that none of the Indians wanted to think about the incident of the wagons . As we have seen , my brother Bill never reported the massacre to Fort Laramie , and the soldiers did n't come , so the Cheyenne had no worry about that . What bothered them was that while drunk they had nearly killed some of themselves ; that 's the worst thing a Cheyenne could do : kill another Cheyenne . Being drunk is  | On excuse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rots side his guts , giving off a stink to other members of the tribe , fling the Sacred Arrows , and driving the buffalo away . Such a Ilow can not smoke the pipe , nor will anyone eat from a dish he as touched ; he is generally run out of camp . Nov I know at this point you figure you have one on me . The way I described the whiskey fight , it looked as if some of the Indians were killed : for example , I surely said Pile of Bones blew off the back of ' White Contrary 's head and the latter 's brains run out . I ' wear that insofar as anybody could have told on the spot , that is what happened . But imagine my surprise when on that first morning In the Cheyenne camp , directly after the bath we boys took in the creek , who should show up waiting for us to take him to his horse but White Contrary , big as life and twice as ugly , and showing in no particular that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taking a special interest in the back of his head , but if there was a hole in it , you could n't prove it by me . I saw a louse or two crawling along the part of his braids , but not even a crust of dried blood . And it was White Contrary , all right , for he had an unmistakable wart on the left flange of his nose . Maybe you are beginning to understand , when I pulled the arrownut-of-arse trick , why it did n't occur to none of the children that I was hoaxing them . That is because Indians did not go around expecting to be swindled , whereas they was always ready for a miracle .  | page deleted  | page deleted  | an old man who kept it in his mind . Numbers got boring when you run out of fingers , so to report the size of an enemy war party you had spotted would go something like this : " The Ute is near the Fasting Place Butte . They are as many as the arrows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ghost antelope in the tim ( when the cherries was ripe . " This being a famous story , everybody in Old Lodge Skins 's crowd would know within one or two the num ! I her of Ute referred to  --  and in a moment of emergency , when a person tends to fear the unknown , they could connect it up with something familiar . A Cheyenne believed his animal was also Cheyenne and knew it . " ' fell your puny , " Burns Red would say , " that the people will talk about his bravery all over camp . Tell him stories about famous ponies and their exploits , so that he will try to do as well . Tell him everything about yourself . A man should keep no secrets from his II pony . There are things he does not discuss with his brother , his friend , or his wife , but he and his pony must know everything about each other because they will probably die together and ride the I hinging Road between earth and heaven . " " Hie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn fool , speaking to a dumb beast . " That 's the difficulty in being white : you ca n't get away with much . Nobody expects more of an Indian ; with him fool things are , so to speak , normal . You 'd be disappointed in an Indian if he did n't talk to horses , the way I look at it , for he is born crazy . But being white , I knowed too much even at the age of ten . You understand that I ca n't give no day-to-day account of my upbringing . It must have took a couple of months to learn to ride without being g tied on , and longer to get real proficient with the bow and arrow . But now I got to go back to that very first morning and wake u a Old Lod1 , c Skins , who we left dead to the world . That Indian got al intending to fast for twenty-four hours . He had had another dream about antelope . Coming on top of the one of the day previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the afternoon the chief went up the creek maybe three hundred yards and just beyond the brush erected a little tepee about the size of the play-lodges we kids had , just big enough for him to sit in . He went inside at sunset and did a number of secret things till dawn the next day . While he was in there , throughout the night certain other Cheyenne would go and beat upon the outside of the tepee cover . What  | nt on here concerned the preparation for a gigantic antelope round . If when them other men pounded on the lodge skin any u:uitity of antelope hair fell off the cover , the hunt would be cessful. cssful . While this was taking place , a party of Ute run off the whole horse herd , and next morning the only Cheyenne ponies left was the few that their owners had tethered right outside their tepees. 11ov ever , quite a mess of antelope hair was laying on the ground about the medicine tent , so the lookout was good . Old Lodge Skins emerged from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from usual in that his eyes seemed to be focused miles away in whatever direction he turned . He was carrying two short black poles , each with a hoop on its end and decorated ' with raven feathers , and when he walked into open country , the whole camp trooped along behind  --  men , women , children , and dogs . I have told about antelope as we encountered that little herd the day before at the buffalo wallow : they can run a mile in one minute and will stampede on a change of wind . Fhis quick beast has one flaw against living to old age : he is nosy . Show an antelope something that flutters and he ca n't resist it . That is the practical side of those poles-and-wheels that Old Lodge Skins was carrying : the Cheyenne called them antelope arrows , and they were deadlier than if equipped with iron points , for they made the skittish beast so curious he would run himself and his kin into suicide for a closer look . Admitting that , there was still a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic . I suppose we must have walked three miles out in the prairie  --  everybody except one decrepit old woman and a warrior who stayed behind because he had the sulks . At a certain point on a space of flatland we stopped , and Old Lodge Skins set down on the prairie . 1 le had left behind his plug hat , and wore two eagle feathers braided into his hair . Now the unmarried women come up before him , and he chose the stoutest two by waving the antelope arrows at them , sort of charming them into sitting alongside him . One girl was average fat , but the second was so chubby it took a keen watch to find the features of her face ; her eyes was like little seeds . Set a fat girl to catch fat antelope , was the idea . Them braves that still kept their horses now mounted , and the rest of us fell in on either side of the chief and the fatties so as to make a half-circle with them in the middle . Two other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antelope arrows from Old Lodge Skins and dashed away on diverging tracks like the legs of a V with him at the point . Off go the horsemen in pursuit , the two leaders overtaking the girls and swiping the medicine sticks , then riding on still along the V legs , holding up the little wheels with the raven feathers fluttering . Now a single antelope come into sight on a roll of ground about a quarter mile ahead of the riders , in the exact center between their two files , on a dead line with Old Lodge Skins 's position . Like men , grazing antelope put out sentries . These here signal the herd I , v putting up their white tails like signal flags . What would you think a pronghorn scout might do when he saw twenty ( : hcvennc galloping on either flank and a bunch more standing in the midst of the prairie around an old Indian and two tubby maidens ? Well , this one stared so hard you would have thought his ears might shoot of his head . Meanwhile the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he looked right , but them equal forces emanating from the flanks sort of compressed his attention back to the middle , and even at the distance you could see him quiver from the haunches though his yellow cheeks and black muzzle was froze in wonder . Old Lodge Skins set within the red blanket , the white plumes on the ends of his two feathers blowing in the soft wind . The two fat girls was still as mounds of earth , nor among the pack of dogs did one cur so much as show a tongue ; they was also Cheyenne . That scout moved forward , placing each dainty hoof as if it was a separate decision , his white neck-bands puffed out like a collar of shirring . Along the crest behind him appeared a margin of little horns , followed at length by little tan heads , staring our way . The forward horsemen gained the rise and went over , the funnel they made ever widening , with its neck pointing to Old Lodge Skins sitting way back here in the crescent of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines of flank , with full space between each Indian to let through a nation of antelope , but these beasts , being charmed , had no mind to escape . Down the slope trotted that sentry ; behind him the horizon was full of animals , with more crowding over . He came a hundred yards on , and still there was no end to the massing herd , forming the shape of a huge arrowhead back of his lead , aimed at Old Lodge Skins . Cheyenne and animals were harmonizing in a grand rhythm , for  | ? Which the old chief beat time . I guess the gods was supposed to have rtt the music . If you do n't like that aspect of the affair , then you 'll ve a job explaining why maybe a thousand antelope run towards In ; and also how Old Lodge Skins could know this herd would be this place , for no animal had showed a hair before he sat down on the prairie . I he lead riders , with the staffs and wheels , having reached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , changing sides one to the other , galloped back to Old Lodge Skins and gave him the jwedicine devices . There was now a magic line tied round the antelope , and with a wand in each hand , the chief began to draw it in . I Ie flang up his arms , and the whole vasty herd began to run , its head some seventy yards out , its tail just coming over the rise . A tied three hundred yards of prairie was jammed with animals , Lunch to haunch ; with the width of the mass at the rear covering about the same measure east to west : an enormous heaving wedge of pure antelope . We people now stirred , extending the crescent horns , rounding out the base of the V into a U , and the beasts came towards a living corral of which the walls was Cheyenne  --  men , women , children  --  made solid by their outspread blankets and the dogs between their legs . Half along the left arm of it , I tried to cock an eye on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush as faster animals overtook him , and soon all particularity was lost in the churning of numberless legs and clouding dust . The chief waved his wheels as the leaders reached the entrapment , and they diverted left , but there met the Cheyenne fence ; then to the right with similar dismay . He crossed the wands twice , and the eyes of the foremost beast followed suit , nose snorting , and it locked hoofs and went to its knees , forming a hurdle for those hard behind , which they failed to negotiate . This pile-up happened right before me , and from there on it was sheer panic as beast dumb upon beast and butted each other 's brains out , goring one another 's bellies , and some just plain trampled into the earth . We closed in then , and the horsemen completed the great circle , everybody with a club or hatchet or maybe merely a big stone , but no kind of projectile for this tight work . I 'd say it took a good hour to beat every last antelope to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of animals died of their own efforts . At no time did Old Lodge Skins put down his wands , but rather  | kept on gesticulating till no beast lived to see them ; that was hi , . duty and obligation , and he took no part in the killing . So far as I went , I had not the strength at that age to do much damage even to such a fragile animal , but joined my efforts to the general mob , pounding a rock at tan hide wherever an opening showed . I might have struck Younger Bear once or twice in the confusion , for h ( was very near Inc . That boy tried to break an antelope 's neck with his bare hands , like some of the stronger men could , by twisting its horns . I lc could n't manage it , and finally had to sink his hatchet between the cars , and its starting eyes welled with blood from the inside and its tongue retched forth and it died .  | YOU MIGHT HAVE NOTICED that Old Lodge Skins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me say that was true only around white men . Among the Cheyenne he was a sort of genius . It was him who taught me everything I learned as a boy that was n't physical like riding or shooting . The way he done this was by means of stories . I reckon he told me and the other children many a hundred such tales , and sometimes the grownups would listen too , for he was held to be a wise old Indian and would n't have lived to his ripe age had he not been . I 'm going to tell you two of his tales . One of them saved my life when I went on my first horse-stealing raid . The other , which he spoke at a council-meeting with some Sioux , will give you a better idea of the difference between red men and whites than anything else short of having lived as both , like me . Several snows had fell and melted since I joined the Cheyenne , and I must have been going on thirteen years of age . We boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taller by the month , shot a blunt-head arrow with such force that when it struck a lad called Red Dog in the forehead he was knocked cold . I believe it had been aimed at me , but I was ever a shifting target . Old Lodge Skins happened along at the moment in the company of an Indian by the name of Two Babies , who was naked and painted black from head to toe and going out to take an enemy scalp in accord with some vow . Two Babies just walked by in a kind of trance ; but when Old Lodge Skins saw Red Dog laying unconscious , he leaned over him and said : " Come on and eat ! " The lad woke up instantly , and the  | chief sent him over to Buffalo Wallow Woman for a meal , which will cure an Indian of almost anything . Then Skins said to Younger Bear : " It is a brave warrior who tries to kill his friends . " And the Bear was full of shame . Old Lodge Skins spread his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . His braids was wrapped in weasel fur , and he wore a sort of little scarf ornamented with the old-time beads that dated from before the whites come with their glass jewelry : these was fashioned from the purple section of the ocean shell , and since the Cheyenne lived in the middle of the country , they must have reached the chief liv a long history of trading , starting maybe a century or so hack when sonic coastal savage in Oregon or Massachusetts cracked open a clam , sucked down the rubbery meat , and fell wit la his stone drill to fashion something cunning from the shell . The chief said : ' Tin going to tell you about a warrior who loved his friends . This happened many snows ago , when I was a young man . In those days you seldom saw a gun among us , because we did very little trading with the white men and of course other Indians would keep what firearms they could get hold of . We did n't even have nary iron arrowheads , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping to get shot by his arrows so as to get some of those iron points . " I Ic laughed heartily , and pulled up his legging to show his right calf and its mass of ancient punctures . " ' There was n't any other way to get them at the time . For horses , we would generally go south to the land of the Snake People , for they arc great riders and have the best ponies . It is said the reason for this is that they mate with horses , but I have never seen this with my own eyes . " The Comanche is who he was talking about , the world 's finest riders , excelling other Indians ; and whether or not they coupled with mares , I know for a fact they mounted their own women stallion-style , from behind , neighing and snorting ; they was all horse-crazy . " Sometimes we would not really need the horses but would go just for fighting , because the Snakes arc a brave people and it lifts your heart to see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun is still a young man in the sky ; later on , when he is middle-aged , it gets too hot in their country and you can see why years earlier the Human Beings ran them down there and kept this place for ourselves , which is perfect . " Talk of war always cheered Old Lodge Skins . He 'd lose several  | cades right in front of you , his eyes would heat up and his checks lied out , and he 'd positively chortle at a specially gory turn . " One time a party of six Human Beings was after horses in the ake Country : Hawk 's Visit , Little Robe , Horse Chief , Iron Shirt , Crazy Mule , and Little Man . With them also was a man called I fairy , of the Arapaho who you know have always been our friends and usually camp with the Human Beings . Now this party had starred out with the intention of capturing wild horses rather than stealing those of the Snakes . Otherwise Hairy would not have gone along , because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Near the headwaters of the Washita , our men came upon the trail of a big Snake village and determined to raid it after nightfall , although they had no guns and only a few remaining arrows and could not fight long if the Snakes caught up with them afterwards . " Having located the camp , they hid until dark . Then they crept in and stole a herd of beautiful ponies . Hairy did not take part in this raid , owing to the treaty his people had with the Snakes . He waited outside camp , holding their own ponies for the Human Beings , and when they came driving the herd he went with them . They rode all night and half the next day without stopping until the sun stood where he could have looked right down the smokehole of a tepee . By then they had reached the Stinking Creek , where a horse can drink but not a man . So they watered that herd . " But they had not been able to ride fast , having to drive the stolen horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snakes arrived , in a number that was more than ten for every Human Being also including Hairy . Our men mounted their ponies and went up onto a little knoll , then killed the animals to make a fortification , stripped off their leggings and shirts , and singing their songs , prepared to die . " Before the Snakes charged , a chief of theirs named Moon rode up near enough the knoll to be clearly seen and said , in the signs : You Plenty of Tattooed Marks , ' which is how the Snakes call our friends the Arapaho , why are you stealing our horses with the Striped Arrow People ? Your tribe and mine are at peace . Are you a bad person ? ' " Hairy stood up and answered : I did not enter your camp nor did I steal your horses . These are my friends . I have lived with them , eaten with them , and fought alongside them . So , although it is true that I do not have a quarrel with you , I think it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hear you , ' Moon signaled back and joined his people , and they  | charged the knoll , killing Iron Shirt , Hawk 's Visit , and Little Robe , but the remaining four fought so bravely that the Snakes retired , having lost several of their own , with some others wounded . Then the Snakes charged again , but with only about ten of their warriors instead of the whole party , and Hairy was killed with a lance through the chest , but he put his last arrow into the neck of the man who did it as he was being ridden down . The Snake toppled off his horse , grasping the mane , and in its rearing and plunging the pony kicked Crazy Mule in the stomach and another Snake leaned over while galloping and brained him with a war club . Also Horse Chief was given a bad wound , from which he soon died . " Now only Little Man remained alive , and he had no more arrows . I lc had to wait until a Snake shot an arrow at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shoot it back . In this fashion , he had killed one of the riders and wounded another as the charge went over the knoll . But now the Snakes were coming back from the other side , six or seven of them , riding down on him with their short lances . " ' 1 he first Snake had just gained the crest when Little Man seized a blanket front the pile of clothes our people had discarded , and shouting ' I lu , hu , hu ! ' he flapped it at the pony 's head , scaring the animal just enough so that it faltered from the proper line of charge , and the lance missed Little Man , making a long rent in the blanket , instead . ( rasping the rider 's belt , Little Man pulled him from the back of the pony . The Snake no sooner struck the ground than Little Man made three quick knife cuts across his throat , but could not take the scalp , for the other Snakes were on him . He leaped upon the pony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from them that the Snakes retreated across the plain to where their main force was waiting . " Little Man rode hack and forth upon the knoll , singing his death song , while the Snakes held a council . Then Moon came forward and said in the signs : ' You are a brave man . We have taken back the horses you stole and do not want to fight any more . You may go home . ' " But Little Man said : ' I do not hear you . ' And Moon went back and the Snakes charged again , this time with twenty men , and Little Man killed several with his lance and went himself untouched . Now the Snakes were really frightened ; they had never before tried to fight against such powerful medicine . " Moon rode forward again and signaled : ' You are the bravest  | iped Arrow Person we have ever seen . Keep that pony you arc Ir ing and keep the lance , and we will also give you another horse . o back to your people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ' No thank you , ' said Little Man . All my friends are dead , intiding one who was loyal to the Human Beings although he was msc lf an Arapaho . Without my friends I would just sit around all y and weep . You had better kill me , too . It is a good day to die . ' ' ? Thereupon Little Man raised the lance above his head , and sounding the war cry and the name of his people , he charged the cut ire Snake force . Moon was a brave chief , but when he saw Little Man galloping towards him , shouting those terrible cries , he screamed and tried to run away , but Little Man overtook him and ran the lance halfway through his body , where it stuck . So Little , lan drew his knife and continued the charge into the Snake army , who fell away before him . He rode among them like the whirlwind , , t abbing and cutting on all sides so furiously as if he had a knife for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are a valiant people . " At last a Snake with a musket shot Little Man in the back , and he pitched to the ground and the Snakes cut off his head . But when they had done that , Little Man 's body got up and began to fight again with the knife it still grasped in its hand . And his head , which they mounted on a spear , started again to shout the war cry . The Snakes could take no more . They galloped off fast as they could go , and those that looked back saw Little Man 's headless body running after them , waving his knife . Then when they were out of reach , it walked to the top of the knoll and lay down among its friends . Nobody knows what happened to the head , which was dropped by the man carrying the spear when it began to shout . " Moon recovered afterwards but was humpbacked like a buffalo for the rest of his life . He bore no shame for his running because Little Man had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to stand against . Moon told me this story himself in a later time when we made peace between our tribes , and the Snakes also found Little Man 's brother and gave him that horse they had promised , so that they could go again to the place where Little Man died , without being attacked by his body . " I had not seen a white person since Caroline snuck out of camp that night . One time since , when we was camped on the Surprise River and us boys was out hunting prairie chickens , we saw some  | moving objects a couple miles off that I took for buffalo , but Little Horse , with his Indian eyes , said no , they was white men , that one had yellow hair , was armed with a shotgun , and rode a bay that w : : . , slightly lame in the left forefoot ; and the other wore a beard and was mounted on a roan with a saddle sore . Also , they was lost , bui he could sec that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would strike the river and know where they was . So we wens in the other direction . There was a reason why we did n't hanker none to meet these whites : it had begun to mean had luck for the Cheyenne . You remember s hat happened at the wagon train of my white family : some Cheyenne had almost killed one another . Then some bad things was occurring from time to time down at Fort Laramie , where a number of Indians camped roundabout to trade . A young man might get drunk and take a shot at a soldier or run off with some horses . And once a Sioux come across an old sick cow strayed from some emigrant train , and killed it for its hide . Burned up at this , the Army attacked the Indian camp and several individuals on both sides was rubbed out . We was sixty-seventy miles away from Laramie on War Bonnet Creek at the time of this incident but knew about it quick enough . Some Minneconjou , which was a type of Sioux or Lakota , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hump , and our other principal men . Anybody can attend such a meeting , and can say anything that is n't ridiculous , but generally the chiefs do the talking because they are wiser , which is why they are chiefs . Luckily there was a man with the Minneconjou who knew Cheyenne , for though the I luman Beings and the Sioux been allies for generations , they speak altogether different languages and usually have to converse in the signs as if they had no closer connection than a Portugucc and a Russian . So this man interpreted . Great Elk , a Minneconjou , stood up and told what happened down at Laramie , concluding : " I have met many Wasichu " ? which is how the Sioux call whites ? " and drunk their coffee and eaten their molasses , which is good . " I-lerc many of the Cheyenne sitting round the tepee said : " I low , how . " " But I have never known why they came to our country , " Great Elk went on . " First there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Lakota took pity on them and gave them food . Then many came with the ugly cattle that one can not eat because they  | Vc lost their testicles and have tough flesh , being good only to pull c Wasichu wagons which are filled with useless things except for t ( te coffee and sugar and the iron hoops of barrels , from which you can make arrowheads . The Wasichu women are sick-looking and make me sneeze . Then the soldiers came with their big , weak horses ; and they have no wife each man for himself but share among them a w women whom one must give a present every time he lies with her . ? i " If a Wasichu does something that the other Wasichu do not like , they tie a rope around his neck and drop him from a high place , so as to pull his spirit from his body . They talk of the great villages they have in the place where the sun rises , but if that is so , why do they come to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you why : the Wasichu are sick , and if they ever had the great villages they by about , everybody there has died from Iving with those sick women or eating that bacon which stinks , and now the rest come here and if we do n't kill them all , they will infect the Lakota and our friends the Shyela . " The latter was the Sioux name for " Cheyenne . " Great Elk sat down then and scratched his lice , and another Sioux spoke to the same effect , and then our Hump stood up to talk . He was n't much of an orator , but he sure had a grasp of the practicalitics . " If we are going to fight the white man , we had better get some guns and powder . The only place we can get enough guns and powder and shot to fight the white man is from the white man . I do not think that he will want to give them to us for this purpose ; we have very little to buy them with even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we certainly ca n't take them away from him , for if we could do that , we would n't need guns and powder and shot for this purpose . " Hump thought for a moment , opening and closing his mouth for air since his nose was permanently obstructed by that damage he sustained at the wagons . " I do n't know , either , what the white men are doing here . I think they may be crazy . I think it 's better to keep away from them , since we do n't have guns and powder and shot . " Great Elk got up again and said : " At the fort was a young soldier chief who said with ten men he could rub out the entire nation of Shyelas , and with thirty men , all the people of the plains . But we Minneconjou , along with some Oglala , rubbed him out instead . This  | is his ring that I am wearing on a string around my neck . I used to have his finger , too , but I lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and put on that falsetto that proper oratory called for . The following remarks was developed deep in the chest , but come out high and quavering after having fought a passage through his tightened throat . The first time you heard it , you might have thought the poor devil was dying of II strangulation ; but it could get the wind up in you once you caught the style . I For a while he flattered the Alinneconjou and the rest of the Lakota . Then he reminded them of the Cheyenne theory that they was established in the Marl : Ilills and rich in horses at the time when the Sioux showed up there poor as could be and with only dogs for transport , and the I Ionian Beings took pity on them and give them a horse now and again , which enabled the Sioux to prosper into the great tribe they was at present . " As to the white men , " he said after an hour or so , " among my people it was my grandfather 's grandfather who saw them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Ground . In those days our people lived near the Lake You Can not See Across , in houses of earth , and they raised corn . One morning Walking on the Ground and several other human Beings were tracking a bear along a creek when they carte across the trail of another kind of animal they had never seen before . These new tracks were almost the size of a bear 's , but they showed no toe marks and were round and smooth . Our people believed these tracks to have been made by a water-animal , II whose toes were joined one to another so he could swim well . " They followed the trail until they came to a clearing in the forest , and there they saw six of these new animals , and the grizzly bear too , who had also been tracking them . The new animals looked strange to our people . They seemed to be naked , but each one had a different type of fur or skin and another shape of head . Our men then thought they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him they stood on their hind feet and had bulky bodies and used their front paws like hands . " But the next moment , the grizzly bear charged the new animals , and several of the latter took from between their legs their penises , which were longer than their arms , put them against the shoulder , and making a great noise , shot flame and smoke at the grizzly and he fell dead .  | " Our people were terribly frightened at this and ran back through the forest to their village to tell the others , and the others were excited and had to see these new animals for themselves . So all c warriors in the village went back to the clearing where the ? nimals were and hid in the bushes and watched them . One of the ' animals stripped the skin off its body and head and our men clapped their mouths in astonishment . But when the animal 's fur was off , it looked just like a human being except that its flesh was white and it had hair all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put its skin hack on , and our men then realized that what they thought was its hide was actually clothing . " Several of the animals had hairy faces , and our people supposed these to be the males , whereas the smooth-faced ones were the females . And they saw that the lightning-shooting sticks were not the penises of those animals , but they sometimes stood holding them between their legs , so it had looked that way . " Our men drew back into the forest and held a counsel . Hungry Bear said : ' I do n't think we should bother these animals or make them angry , because they are very strange and you ca n't tell what t hey will do . ' " Black Wolf , who had not been with the first party that saw the shooting , said : We could easily kill them , but that white flesh does n't look as if it would be good to eat , though the skin might make a pretty shirt . ' " But Walking on the Ground , who was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they are men . You know the old prophecy made by our great hero Sweet Medicine , that a new people would one day come among us , their skins white and their ways odd . And you know that he said they will bring us bad luck . But now they are here , and it is better for us to find them than for them to come upon us by surprise . " ' Here is what we should do : I will walk into their camp and look at them . The rest of you watch from the bushes . If the white persons attack me , then we must fight them and someone should go back to the village and send the women and children to hide . If I am not attacked , then some of you can also come into camp . ' " Walking on the Ground stripped himself to the breechclout and went alone into the clearing . The first white person to see him started to raise the lightning stick , but another  --  without hair on its face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first and  | thrust its hand at Walking on the Ground . My grandfather 's grand father stopped and looked her in the eyes , for our people had never heard of shaking hands at that time . Then other white men came all around Walking , and our men in the bushes started to stretch their bows , but soon they saw the whites were not trying to harm the Human Being but rather smiling at him and making talk , and so some of them came out of the hushes and went into that camp . " The smooth-faced persons turned out to be men as well as the hairy-checked , and one of them wore a golden cross around his neck and when he took off his hat his head was mostly bare skin except for a fringe around his cars . I lc got two sticks and making a cross of them , stuck it in the earth , and then all the white men fell upon their knees while the bald one closed his eyes , folded his hands , and talked . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightningand-thunder sticks and let them pull the triggers , but our people were still scared % hen the shots came . " Those first white men staved in that place for about one moon and started to build a square house of logs . Our people would visit them every day , and the man with the cross would give them presents and make signs that they should kneel upon the ground while he talked to the crossed sticks which were his medicine , and so they would do so to he polite . " But then one night , while half of the white party was sleeping , the other half- killed them and took all their things and burned up the house and went over to the Big Water , got into a boat they had there , and went away . " That is the truth as it has come down to me , " said Old Lodge Skins . " And the same thing happened many times thereafter , whenever the white people appeared . They do not like each other , and sooner or later one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle , the way our people do to prove themselves brave and to enjoy the courageous deaths of our enemies and to die on a good day , but rather by shooting in the back or stretching the neck or by infecting one another with the coughing-sickness and sores or making people lose their heads with whiskey . " But I say they are white , and not like us , and there may be some reason why they act this way that one can not understand unless he is himself white . If they ever attack me , I will defend myself . But until such time , I will avoid them . " That was when we went up into the Powder River country ,  | ugh we was n't in no hurry and first went south for a day or so rng the Surprise River and took buffalo there . Them was the days fore the railroad and the professional white hunters , and you uld find single herds numbering in the hundreds of thousands , avbc a square mile or more of beasts crowded so thick you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheyenne would get them milling and drop one after another with arrow or spear and it would make no appreciable difference in the size of the herd . Then the women would come out for the butchering and when it was done haul the usable parts back to camp on the hide , which was nfterward fleshed and stretched on a frame for a robe or lodge cover . We 'd eat boiled tongue and roast hump then , the finest grub in the world , alongside which your best beefsteak will taste like a singed bootsole . But it is all gone now . Now it 's true there was n't no white men up on the Powder , but there was Crow Indians roundabout . The Cheyenne and the Crow was generally enemies , but made a peace some years before when the Government got most of the warring tribes together on Horse Creek east of Laramie and had them sign a treaty not to fight one another . This worked fine between tribes that never came in contact with the next , but did n't last long with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight a Pawnee . And if you did n't fight , you 'd turn into a woman . So with the Crow , who was by the way friends of the whites , claiming never to have killed a white man and for that reason they was always let to keep their country . The Crow was brave men when they fought the Cheyenne and Sioux alone , but when they served as scouts for the U.S. Cavalry , they often turned coward . I do n't know why . Anyway , we no sooner had got up to the Powder than some of our men who was out spying come in with the news that a big camp of Crow had been located on the Crazy Woman 's Creek . " If it is a big camp , they must have a lot of ponies , " said Hump . Shadow That Comes in Sight , one of the spies , said : " Those Crow are very rich in ponies . They are the most beautiful ponies I have ever seen . I hid all day in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have heard you , " said Hump and sighed . The group then went over to talk with Old Lodge Skins , a bunch of us boys following along .  | " Do you need ponies ? " the chief said after he had been apprised . Shadow nodded his head very sad , saying : " Never have I been so poor . " Old Lodge Skins asked the same question of the others and got the same answer . Then he spoke , groping within his blanket : " I received this medal for making my mark on the peace paper between us and the Crow . On it is the face of the Father who lives in the main village of the whites . I said that I would not fight with the Crow while the sun still shines forever , and I do not speak in two directions . But none of you made your mark on that paper and none of you wear- this medal . I do n't think the Father knows who you arc . My own favorite type of horse is pinto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Shadow That Comes in Sight- , Cold Face , Yellow Eagle , Bird Bear , and Long Jaw . It was autumn of the year , uu with the nights getting brisk , but of course they stripped to the huff so no clothes would get in the way of their quick work . 11 e boys was hanging around doing little services for these men we admired : honing a knife , filling arrow quivers , and so on , when Younger Rear steps up to Shadow and says : " I am ready to go . " Shadow , cinching up his moccasin , answers , " All right , " without looking at him . Younger Rear says : " I have practiced many times , stealing meat front the wonun . " I le was referring to the game we played which like the others trained us for more serious business : the women cut buffalo fled , into thin slices and hung them on rawhide lines to dry in the sun , and we would snake along on our bellies and swipe it , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , she hit you lightly with a stick and you was counted out . Actually Younger Bear was one of the worst at this game ; force , rather than stealth , being his specialty . But he was around fourteen now and he was going to bust if he had to stay a boy much longer . " I killed a buffalo two clays ago , " he went on . This everybody knew because his father had gone around camp singing about it after the hunt and then gave a feast . " I have heard that , " said Shadow . " You can come . " " I am the strongest boy in camp , " Younger Bear said . " You also talk a lot , " said Cold Ii ace , who was tying a little medicine bundle behind his ear for luck . " We 'll stay here and you can go and make a speech to the Crow , who love a big mouth . "  | " You can come , " said Shadow , " if you do n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the face of the earth , the bravest warriors , have the most beautiful and virtuous women , and live in a place that is perfect . That is known to everybody , even our enemies . A Human Being just is and does not have to talk about it . " Now that stuff got my goat even more than Younger Bear 's volunteering to join the raid . I liked the Cheyenne and by this time really felt I was maybe a second cousin to them , but whenever I ran into their arrogance it served only to remind me I was basically white . The greatest folk on earth ! Christ , they would n't have had them iron knives if Columbus had n't hit these shores . And who brought them the pony in the first place ? I was standing at the side of Little Horse and whispered to him , " I 'm going . " He said , " I 'm not , " and left Shadow 's tepee . That was the first sign that I can remember he showed of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the men and asked : " ' Can I go ? " I was in the wrong state of mind for such a dangerous venture , when solidarity is wanted , whereas I was joining out of my difference from my comrades . Them Cheyenne looked at me and then they looked at one another . I was about thirteen , quite the shrimp in build , and I had red hair , blue eyes , and skin that may have been dirty and sunburned and scratched but withal was pale as a fishbelly . I believe it might have occurred to them right then that the Crow was friends of the Americans , and that it probably was foolhardy to take along on what was only too likely to be a fatal expedition for some , a fellow whose trust was n't secured by blood . Not to mention an untried kid . But Shadow says : " All right . " You give an Indian a choice and he is sure to take the reckless alternative : he is inclined to let anybody do what they want . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a boy . You want to be a man so you try what men do , and there ai n't nothing to stop you but the enemy .  | page deleted  | page deleted  | " We 'll leave the ponies here , " whispered Shadow That Comes Sight , " and you and you will hold them , " touching me and Youngs i Bear ; it was O.K. by me . But Younger Bear began to protest so strongly you might have thought he was sobbing . Which infuriated Yellow Eagle . I did n't know that man well , why had joined our camp only a few months back , but he possessed deal of scalps and he owned a percussion-cap carbine , which was rare implement among the Cheyenne in them days . For a long time that was the only gun in our bunch , and it was n't no good owing to a lack of the caps , for we avoided the whites , even traders , like Old Lodge Skins said . Elsewhere , though , the Sioux and other bands of Cheyenne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Frail , taking their coffee now from the emigrants without waiting for it to he offered and sometimes all else as well . I noticed among Yellow Eagle 's collection of hair some which looked too light for Pawnee or Snake ever to have sprouted . The carbine probably carte from the same quarter . The Eagle was burned up at the improper manner in which Younger Bear was carrying on . " You have lived for enough snows , " he scolded him , " to understand that among the Human Beings a veteran warrior knows more than a boy about stealing horses . It has nothing to do with who is brave and who is n't : no Human Being has ever been a coward . You are asked to stav here because someone has to hold the ponies , which is as important a job as going into the Crow camp ; and you know that we shall share equally what we capture . I do n't hear Little Antelope complain . He is a better Human Being than you , and he is white . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispering . Nevertheless an awful silence descended , as if after a riot of noise . Younger Bear had been wrong , but the Eagle turned out more so . I ! Not a word had been said about my race since I joined the tribe , not even by the Bear himself , who hated nic . That was n't done , it could do no good , as the Indians say , and Yellow Eagle no sooner got it out than he knew his error . " That should not have been said , " hc.told me . " A devil had control of my tongue . " I was getting into the wolfskin at the moment , which I slung behind me while I rode ; just aligning the eyeholes so I could see through them . The light was poor and everything looked hairy .  | " I do n't think bad of you , " was my answer , " for you have n't en long with our camp . " " I do n't think it is a good night to steal ponies , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmured agreement and folhI% c ( l suit . " No , " said Yellow Eagle . " I will take away the bad luck I have brought . " He leaped on his horse and rode off in the direction whence we had come . " I 'll stay and mind the ponies , " Younger Bear stated contritely , his head down . " With the other one , " meaning me . So he accepted the halters of three , and I took as many , and so nobody could see us against the moon we kept hard against the left side of the draw that was hereabout maybe seven-eight foot deep , sdc ( luate to conceal men and animals from anybody on the plain above . The four big Cheyenne walked towards the Crow camp glowing across the water . In a minute you could n't see them any more nor hear them in two . After a while the moon finally got rid of that cloud and brightened some though not enough to throw a shadow . I sat down in that wolf suit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sure did n't grieve none that I was not en route into the camp . On the other hand , if I 'd had to go , I could n't have picked better comrades than them four . I had started to get a glimmering of what the Cheyenne meant when they always talked about dying : I began to understand the loyalty to friends , but what I did n't have was the feeling that I myself was disposable . Now that the rest had gone , Younger Bear took up his grumbling again . " They should not have done this to me , " he muttered . " I should have gone along . You could hold six ponies alone . " " For that matter , " says I , " you could hold them all , and I might go . " " You would be scared , " he comes back at me . " Your medicine may be big in play camp , but it would n't fool a Crow . This is the time to be a man . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though he was n't so husky as formerly , having gone into t he skinny lankiness of the teen years . I do n't know what I 'd have been forced to do at this point so as not to let that Indian outface me  --  probably would have dropped them halters had he refused to take them , therewith losing the  | horses , and run towards the enemy camp to join the raiding party , thereby losing my life and throwing those of the others in grave jeopardy . I was saved in a curious fashion . Suddenly an enormous Crow sprang over the bank onto the floor of the draw and knocked Younger Bear senseless with a war club . This in utter silence excepting the impact of his moccasins on the sand , which was scarcely noisy , and the sound of the club against Bear 's head , just a sort of neat chock ! like when you throw a stone against a keg . In a flash his knife was out and his left hand drawing Bear 's braids tight so the scalp would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I was at the Crow , who had n't taken notice of me because he maybe thought I was a real wolf that Bear was talking to  --  an Indian would n't have seen that as funny  --  I was at him and on him as if I was climbing a tree , for he was monstrous large with all his sinews in tension , skin rough as bark . But now I was there , I did n't know what to do with the son of a bitch . I was now too close to shoot a how , which anyway I had dropped , and I was clawing for my knife but that wolfskin was all bunched up and I could n't find it . Of course the Crow was not exactly waiting in amused toleration . The big devil flexed his hide and flung me against the other side of the draw , and I was knocked cold by the meeting of my chin with my own right knee . I conic to within the next second , when the point of his knife had already broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of the head . I started some and the knife scraped bone . That makes the goddamnedest sound , reverberating to your testicles . Now my hair was longer than when I had been with my white kin , but not nearly so long as an Indian wears his . The reason for this is that it grew naturally like snagged wire : let it go a month and I 'd look neither Indian , white , male nor female , but rather like the belly of a goat that had been tracking through fresh dung , for along with the tangle the ginger color would darken , the more the hair , and go to brown , and any kind of animal fat laid on it would streak in green . That was why I 'd hack it off now and again when it got more than halfway down my neck . So this Crow , he was already in the act of scalping me when he hesitated for the briefest space on ac-  | count of the funny feel of that short hair , which sure belonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break in rhythm brought me out of the spell I was under , ly suffering the top of my head to be sliced off , the warm ood running into my right ear . I could n't wrestle him , I did n't ve no weapon , Younger Bear so far as I knowed was stone dead , d the other Cheyenne was in the village by now , too far away to II ) , and if I made a noise the rest of the Crow would be roused and punier my friends . This was the kind of thing for which Old Lodge Skins had told us boys that story about Little Man fighting the Snakes . Sooner or later he knowed it 'd come in handy . I could n't let a Crow do this to a Human Being ! 1 jerked back and bared my teeth . " Nazestae ! " I hissed . " I am Cheyenne ! " It would have sounded ore impressive could I have afforded to shout it as battle cry ; I vc explained why I could n't . But do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife , fell ac k on his haunches , and covered up his mouth with his left hand . Pis thumb had slipped on my movement and run across my forehead , opening up a white streak through that paint made of soot and buffalo grease . He did n't understand what I said , for Crow and Cheyenne have different tongues , but he spoke as if in answer to it and in English : " Little white man ! Fool poor Crow ! Ha , ha , big fooling . You want to eat ? " He was scared I 'd take offense , see , because the Crow always , , sucked up to Americans , and in his dumb way wanted to bring me over to his lodge . It was n't his fault , of course , none of it , and that fellow has always been on my conscience . It appeared he was out in the night by himself for some reason when he run across me and the Bear , and worked quiet for he did n't know how many others of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known that at the moment ; I could n't in the time at my disposal explain the situation for him ; and least of all could I go as his guest to camp , or even let him talk about it any longer in that loud voice . So I had to kill him . Murder him , a friendly fellow like that . Shoot him in the hack , what 's more . In retrieving my wolfskin that had fell off in the struggle , I had found my bow and quiver on the ground . The Crow at that moment was crawling up the wall of the draw to get the pony he had left on the plain .  | Three Cheyenne arrows , thunk , thunk , thunk , in a straight line along his backbone . His hands lost their purchase and his big body slid down again till his moccasins hit bottom , and it stopped rigid on the incline . That was the first I ever took a human life , and however it sounds to you , it was one of the best times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't never have to apologize for that . And after all , he had scalped me almost halfway , which though he later veered friendly left its mark I can tell you . The right side of my face and neck was sticky as molasses with lifeblood  --  mine , very dear to me  --  and I was afcared to feel up there in case my whole skull-cover flapped loose . I dropped out of the picture then . Next time I opened my eyes , I was laying inside a little tepee of brush and alongside me squatted some fellow wearing the top of a buffalo 's head , horns and matted hair , and he was singing and shaking a buffalo tail in my face . I had a terrible headache ; my skull felt as though it had shriveled like a dried pea . I seemed to be wearing a cap of nnid . I tried it gingerly with my fingers , but the medicine man gave a loud buffalo-snort at that moment and spat a mouthful of chawcd-up flower petals into my face . I had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides , the headache gave one great surge and then began to ebb away . I sat up , and Left-Handed Wolf , for that was the medicine man 's name , started to dance around the robe where I lay , singing that monotone curing song interspersed with snorts and bellows . And he kept chewing more dried flowers from a little pouch on his belt a.td blowing them at me from the quarter points of the compass . Then he leaned over and tapped a little stick on my cranium , and off fell the clay cap in two halves in which a few wiry hairs was embedded . Now my head felt especial cool as if indeed the whole scalp was missing , but he spat some flowers on it and it did n't hurt no more at all . Now he danced slowly before me and dangled that buffalo tail just beyond my reach . I tried weakly to seize it , but he 'd back off a little each time . I felt the strength coming up from the soles of my feet , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , still trying to grab the tail that he shook before me while bellowing and  | fuming his horns . His face was painted black , with the eyes and post rils rimmed in vermilion . Wolf backed through the tepee door and I come along , reaching r that tail more and more vigorously , and when I got outside , I w the whole camp , warriors , women , kids , babies , and dogs , lined p in parallel rows from the lodge entrance to the river . They was II by their presence working for my cure . No Cheyenne suffers lone . I was mighty touched by this display and got the power of it , raightening up my back and walking with almost normal force . When we reached the riverbank , Wolf said : " Stretch yourself . " I slid so , and some black blood started from the place above my mple where the Crow had first inserted his knife , and falling into c water was carried away and lost in the Powder 's swift current . en came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owcrs . " I am well now , " said I. That 's the God 's truth , and was the end of the incident . Afterwards I looked in a trade mirror and found a thin blue tracing at the roots of my hair , but even that was gone in a day or so . The moral effects was farther-reaching . For one thing , a crier tight away went about camp singing about what a hero I was and nviting people to a feast Old Lodge Skins was holding in my honor . he chief for celebration give most of his horses away to certain poor Cheyenne who did n't have any , and after the eats he made presents to everybody who come : blankets , jewelry , and so on  --  he ended up almost naked . He also made a speech which from modesty I 'll pass up except for the important points . After recounting my exploit at great length in a poetic fashion that would just sound silly in English , he said : " This boy has proved himself a Human Being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The earth shakes when he walks . The Crow cry like women when he comes ! He is a Human Being ! Like the great Little Man , who came to him in a dream and gave him strength to kill the Crow , he walks ! " This was exaggerating some , but as I told you I did think of Little Man and jerked away from the knife , which caused the Crow 's hand to slip proving I was white . I had told Old Lodge Skins only about the inspiration of Little Man , figuring it would please him . He took it from there .  | After some minutes of the foregoing stuff , which did n't embarrar , me none , for everybody was beaming at me , including some of the young girls who was allowed to peek under the tepeeskin  --  I getting some interest in girls at this point of my life  --  after that , tin chief said : " This boy 's medicine comes from the vision of Little Man . He i , himself little in body and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his name from now on shall be : Little Big Man . " That was it , and that 's how I was called ever after by the Chc enne . True to Indian ways , no one used my real name ; no one evcii knew it . It was Jack Crabb . " The horse-stealing expedition was also in its other respects a job ' well done . Them four warriors had slipped into the Crow village without rousing a soul and took thirty horses , more or less , driving them bade to our camp through what remained of the night into early morning . When they reached where me and Younger Bear was , Bear had come to with a knot on his head but otherwise O.K. Lucky for its that Crow had been wandering without his bow , else we 'd both been plugged from the top of the draw and never ! mowed the difference . So they tied me to my pony and brung me in . I got four horses from the common loot , thereby becoming a man of certain substance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight or nine , named I ) irt on the Nose , asked me : " Now you 're a warrior , can I tend your ponies ? " Meaning I could stay in bed of a morning now when the kids got up for chores . Maybe I could , but it was not the . ( ; hcyennc way to press your advantages . Shadow That Comes itt Sight , for example , the veteran warrior who had led the raid , took a share of three horses , kept the least for himself , giving the best to Old Lodge Skins and the next to Hump  --  not because they was chiefs , for that cut no ice as such ; no Cheyenne kissed the arse of authority  --  but because they had advised him well . Then Bird Bear and Cold Face each give one of their ponies to Yellow Eagle , who though he made a mistake had done the right thing to correct it . Then I gave him one of mine , for the same reason , and since I had been involved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you are n't supposed to he paid for treatment . But it was O.K. to present it to his brother , which I did . Therefore I answered Dirt on the Nose in this wise : " Killing one Crow does not yet make me the equal of the great warriors among  | I Inman Beings . I shall still tend my own horses , but you arc a td boy and I am going to give you that black 1 have been riding . " Everybody said : " How , how . " So none of us who took our life in our hands ended up a hell of a richer except in pride and honor , but a Cheyenne would die for ern things any old day . Younger Bear never showed up at the feast , I think the reason is virus . It went on far into the night , and I ate a good deal too ucli of boiled dog , which was the fare : I had got a taste for that teal by now but had never developed an Indian 's capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other . After the clang was finally done , I went out into the prairie and relieved ysclf and then set for a spell on a nearby rise . The moon was a hair innier than last night , but riding clear . Nevertheless , it would rain wards morning : you could feel that in your nose and through the Ics of your moccasins against the old autumn grass and even rough your haunches on the ground . Nobody ever told me that ) rt of thing . You learned it naturally living in our manner , like a pain in town knows from the look of a storefront that they sell tobacco inside . About a mile away , a coyote barked for a while , then yelped , then howled , then whined in several different notes . It sounded like a whole pack , but was just one animal , for they are natural ventriloquists . He was answered from the north by the long , sorry wail of a timber wolf  --  or Crow raiders imitating the same , for that is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour in the same location , so must have been the real beast . After I had sat there long enough to warm the earth with my rump , a rattlesnake come crawling towards me , as they are ever cold and will move right into your bed if you suffer them to do it , for a 4 bit of warmth . But I heard under the wind noise the slither of his dragging length , so counterfeited the flap of an eagle 's wing and he reversed himself . So I , Jack Crabb , was a Cheyenne warrior . Had made my kill with bow and arrow . Been scalped and healed with hocus-pocus . I lad an ancient savage who could n't talk English for my Pa , and a fat brown woman for my Ma , and for a brother a fellow whose face I hardly ever saw for clay or paint . Lived in a skin tent and ate puppy dog . God , it was strange . That 's how my thoughts was running at that moment , and they  | ji was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play with in Evansville would never believe it , neither would those with our wagons . The knowed I was always mean , but not that rotten . On the night of m ' great triumph , there I sat , thoroughly humiliated . Other than fin my real Pa , the one killed at the wagons , who was crazy , you could seldom find a man hack in town who did n't think an Indian even lower than a black slave . Right then I heard a sound that made me think the rattler had took a second thought and decided in his slow , stubborn way : what 's an eagle doing here in the night ? and come back to try his luck again at getting near that warmth . But it was Younger Bear , sitting down alongside . That shows hox dangerous it can he to think white in the middle of the prairie . I had n't heard hint coining . I could have lost the scalp that just was healed hack on had it been an enemy . le sat there some ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect , thinking red . I did n't say nothing . At last he looked in my direction and said : " Hey , come here ! " " I was here first , " says I. " I got something for you , " he says . " Come on over here and get it . I was n't taking any of his crap now that I had saved his life , so 1 just t timed away and directly he come crawling to me . " I ere , " he said . " 1 Icre 's a present for Little Big Man . " I could n't sec what he was holding behind his back , and leaned to look , and he pushed the big bushy scalp of that Crow into my face , II ' laughing like hell . " That 's a stupid thing to do , " I told him . " You are the biggest fool I have ever known . " He dropped the hair and fell back on his arms . " I thought it was a pretty good joke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perfumed will ) musk . Smell it if you do n't believe me . It 's yours . I took it , hut it should belong to you . You killed him and saved my life . If you want Inc to do anything for you , I will . You can have my pony and best blanker , and I 'll tend your horses . " I was still sore at that silly thing he did ; although it was a typical Indian joke , it showed had taste and worse will at this point . I was n't taken in for a minute by his apparent friendliness . " You know , " said I , " that one Human Being do n't pay another for saving his life . "  | " Yes , " answered Younger Bear in a deadly voice , " but you arc a at . Hain . " There ai n't no curse words in Cheyenne and most of the insults Ice the form of calling the other guy a woman or cowardly , etc. , d even in my anger I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had a great argument . I had just been in the act of inking the same thing . Yet you know how it is : there are women It ) will take pay for letting you on them , but do n't call them bore . " c Now on the needle of this Indian , the worse fate I could imagine ' vas not to be a Cheyenne . He had really hurt my feelings . What I Id-ould have done was to accept it the Indian way , go sulk and fast Until he apologized , which he 'd of had to if only on account of my high prestige in the tribe right then . Actually , Bear did n't but half bclicvc in his own accusation . He was jealous and so had thrown me the dirtiest insult he could think up . If I 'd played it right it would have got him in the backflash : he would have had to prove he was tCheyenne , for I had done so . Instead , I said hotly : " That 's right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you owe me one life . And you ca n't pay me off with that scalp nor a blanket nor all your ponies . Only a life will do , and I 'll let you know when I want one . " I Ic stuck the Crow scalp under his belt and got up . " I heard you , " he said and went back into camp . I had said that because I was mad and wanted to play it big . I did n't know rightly what I meant . It was probably a kid 's bluff . Alvself , I forgot it directly , though remembering Younger Bear 's dislike of me well enough for a while : then I forgot that too , for I did n't see no more instances of it . He stopped shooting play arrows at Inc , put no more burrs under my saddle , in fact seemed to do his bust to pretend I was as solid a Human Being as he had proved me nut to be . But the point is that he never forgot what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and about twenty years later , and some fifty mile away from where we had been sitting that night , he paid me in full . I have said I was getting interested in girls . Just about the time this began to happen , the situation changed so that I could n't get near any of the Cheyenne girls of my own age . They had started to get their monthlies and from that time on was kept away from the  | boys , being always in the company of their mothers or aunts an , I wearing a rope belt between their legs until they got married . ( They wore it after marriage , too , whenever their husband was away . ) About all you could do was to show off when the girl yon liked was watching . That probably comes as a surprise : you ma ? , think an Indian goes at it like a jackrabbit , but not the Cheyenne with their own women unless they are married to them , and since the married men always swear off it before going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Cheyenne were pretty hard up for tail at any given time . That 's why they was such fierce warriors , or so they believed anyway I never knew a man who did n't have special interest in his own member , but to a Cheyenne it was a magic wand . After Younger Ilcar went away and I cooled down , I started thinking about a girl named Howaheh  --  which means , I ask you to believe , " Nothing . " When we were littler and played camp , I had fre*lucniIV been forced to choose Nothing as my make-believe wife , on account of them other boys knew how better to go about getting the good looking ones for themselves and I was left with this girl . who was fairly ugly . But here lately she had , as young girls will , of a sudden turned pretty as a buckskin colt , with big , shy eyes like an antelope and the graceful limbs of a doe . She always used to like me when I did n't pay no attention to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . %'ell , nothing I could do about Nothing right then , so I finalh got up and went down into camp . There was a dog awake there , about to howl in answer to the coyote though he knew it was wrong because it might alert prowling Crow to our location , so I said to hint : " ' That 's not the Cheyenne way , " and he closed his chops and slunk off . Everybody else was sleeping , the fires all cold . I found my robe , not far from the doorhole , and started to get into it when I realized it must be Little I lorse 's , for he was wrapped in it , so I moved on to the empty one alongside , though I usually slept to his left . But he was awake , and whispered : " This is yours . " " It do n't matter none , " I says . " Stay there . " " You want me to ? " he asks , sounding disappointed . And then I went to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheyenne do n't believe he can stand a man 's life , he ai n't forced to . He can become a heemaneh , which is to say half-man , half-woman.  | 1 here are uses for these fellows and everybody likes them . They are iuntctimes chemists , specializing in the making of love-potions , and generally good entertainers . They wear women 's clothes and can ct married to another man , if such be his taste . I Attie Horse began to train to be a heeraneh not long after this incident . Maybe he got the beds mixed up by mistake that night and did n't have anything in mind . Whatever , I personally did n't find n my type .  | page deleted  | page deleted  | I 'll tell you what : after a while , I did n't . The Crow and Ute and Shoshone never protested , on account of they did the same , so what the hell business was it of mine ? You recall Old Lodge Skins ' attitude towards the whites : their ways were nonsensical to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to let no Indian outdo me in tolerance . If Buffalo Wallow Woman or some tiny brown faced kid came in from the field holding a piece of human offal , proud as can he , why I 'd say the equivalent of " Swell ! " I had a bigger problem than that . I was still young but had kills : my man , so if there was a war of any size I did n't find it easy to bee off . I did n't have no inclination to become a heesnaneh like Little Ilorsc , though that 's no criticism of him . There was n't any other alternative . What I did try , not being actually a Cheyenne , was to kill as few of whoever we was fighting as practicable ; that is , I would go all out if it was a defensive action , but slack off if we was carrying the ( lay . I tried , that is , to retain some smattering of civilization while doing nothing to jeopardize my barbarian friends . A very thin line to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savage practices , if you know what I mean . Hell , I guess you do n't . All right , then : I did n't go out of my way to do it , but I had to take hair now and again . So long as I 've confessed that , you also ought to be told that it- such cases the victim ai n't always dead or even unconscious , and your knife ai n't always sharp and sometimes there is an ugly sound as the scalp parts company with the skull . I kept it to a minimum , but sometimes Younger Bear was close by me on the field of battle , offering no choice . By the age of fifteen he carried so many scalps about his person and gear that at a certain distance he seemed covered all over with hair , like a grizzly . I do n't want to overemphasize this practice . There was another , fortunately for ntc , that took precedence over it : I mean the making of coups , riding into the midst of the enemy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little stick carried just for that purpose . It is a greater accomplishment than killing him because more dangerous for the practitioner , and if you had to reduce the quality of Cheyenne life to a handy phrase you might describe it as the constant taking of risks . I could always try to count coups when I wanted to avoid bloodletting , and I often did , though not being among the foremost in  | at pursuit . To be outstanding at it , you had to be crazy . I held my n and never tried to compete with Coyote , who among the Inch of my age was champion and became a bigger hero for it . In Younger Bear with all his hair . The Bear made valiant efforts It at the last minute he could n't help setting aside his coup stick or his hatchet and instead of touching he would hack . But Coyote Ide unarmed into the press of the enemy and , slashing lightly with is little quirt , took coups more quickly than they could be enumered , and though his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bold generally come back without a scratch , having great mediinc . Now I might go on for hours relating the incidents of war , but hcreas they are every one different in the actual occurrence and ever dull when your own life is at stake , they have a sameness in e telling . So I wo n't wear them to the point where you think fighting is as routine as riding on a streetcar . Nor will I go into my numerous wounds , most of which I still bear slight traces of , like Vatted tattooing . That same summer that we was up on the Powder , a colonel named Harney attacked the Brule Sioux in their camp on the Blue River , above the North Platte , and killed eighty . It almost goes without saying that these Indians was friendlies , otherwise the Army would n't have found them ; and put up no resistance , else they would n't have been punished to that degree . Some of that figure was made up of women and children , on account of the warriors retreated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ignorance . I 'm talking about both Indians and whites . A coward kills women , but a soldier of that time at full gallop often could n't tell them from the braves , and the kids got it from the indiscriminate hail of lead . As to the fleeing warriors , you got to know Indian ways to appredare that . When they fight each other , one side charges and the other retreats ; then they turn and reverse the situation . This makes for a nice contest in which everybody gets his chance . The Army did n't fight by the rules and no doubt would not have if they knew them , for a white man gets no pleasure out of war itself ; he wo n't light at all if without it he can get his way . He is after your spirit , not the body . That goes for both the military and the pacifists ,  | neither breed of which is found among the Cheyenne , who fougle because of the good it did them . They had no interest in power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Powder River we heard about this incident even as it was happening , in the Indian way which I have already toll you I ca n't explain , so just accept it as I did . Red Dog mentioned ii to mc , and for all I know he got it from an eagle , for he was an eagle catcher , which is a special profession among the Cheyenne . Within a minute or two it was all over camp . The chiefs did n't hold an council this time , because for one thing no Sioux appeared with an project , and for another , it had just gone to prove Old Lodge Skins , wisdom in staving away from white men and thus giving them no opportunity to break any rules . We stayed the rest of the year up in that territory , which was prettier country than along the Platte , nearer to lodgepoles , fire wood , elk , and bear , for the Big Horn Mountains rose fifty-sixty mile to the west with their purple base climbing to a silver crown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the watercourse : fresh through the summer from their melting snows . When winter conic , we left off fighting on the larger scale , though now and again you might encounter little enemy parties trapping buffalo in the drifts while you was out doing the like , and the whiteness might end up splashed here and there with red . But sometimes it was just too cold , with the snow up to a bull 's shoulders , and I recall once when four of us coming back from an unsuccessful hunt ran across six Crow in a blizzard , we reached wearily for our slung bows , but they signaled : " We 'll fight when the weather gets better , " and went on . That was a relief : you could hardly see than . When it got real fierce , when your very speech would freeze as it emanated front your lips and blow back in stinging rime against the cheeks , we hung close to the tepees and ate the dried meat taken the summer before and stored in rawhide parfieches , and pemmican , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melting fat will warm you sooner and stick longer than most anything I know . The value of stout women also went up in the snowtime , and I believe it was that winter that that enormous fat girl from the antelope surround ran the price for her hand up to six horses and other gifts too numerous to count ( all of which went to her family ) and was led to the bridegroom 's lodge .  | c time when Nothing was outside her tepee gathering snow in tie to melt down for water , I slogged over to her vicinity and bled like a bird , but she did n't take any more notice than if I n't been present , and soon her Ma come out and throwed a little c at me and said go away , bad boy . That was the extent of my c life that winter . fly the thaw we was all , men and animals , pretty well trimmed wn to basic muscle and sinew , with our tongues sharp for fresh ' vender . Spring was really something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry and young . Old Lodge Skins sift the latter by upwards of fifty years , but the sap rose in him fore it did in the trees and he got his younger wife , White Cow Woman , with child again . I have previously mentioned only Burns Kcd and Little Horse as his offspring , because I was closest to them , but there was others around in various sizes , of which I did n't take much notice of the little girls and was banned by custom from doing so with the females of my own age , they being so to speak my sisters ; and more was dead . Shooting Star , Burns Red 's wife , was also pregnant , and a lot of the other women after that season of lay-off from war . These new children would make up for our losses in battle , those that were ttiales , that is , and if they grew up . At present there was five or six women to every adult brave . I 've slipped by the subject of death as if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; mostly it was an even score in the long run . What made the Cheyenne special was that they were fewer than most of their enemies ; always outnumbered but never outfought , as the saying goes . As to the punishment we sustained , I do n't count wounds , and sometimes apparently mortal ones would be cured by the medicine men in the style I 've described , but it might give an idea when I say that before the winter closed in , three of those five grownups I went on the raid with were dead : Cold Face , Long Jaw , and Yellow Eagle . Spotted Wolf , who if you recall was going to assault my hite Ma when Caroline cold-cocked him , he was killed against the Pawnee in the spring before . These is just to mention some of the names you might recognize . We never at full strength could mount more than forty warriors . For a long time I believed Old Lodge Skins 's bunch was the whole Cheyenne nation , then at least one of the main bands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned out to be was one big family : Dili  | most of these folk were related to one another by blood or marring ( or adoption , and there was a few stragglers from hither and von , now and then , but not enough to alter the complexion of things . A Cheyenne wo n't pass on shameful gossip about himself or his own . So it was a while before I found out why Old Lodge Skins 's camp kept to themselves . Quite some years back , when Old Skins was a boy , his P:l had killed a fellow Cheyenne in a quarrel over a woman and been exiled from the Burnt Artery hand . Him and his relatives took ofl and lived alone , and at length he died , but the kin had lived so long by themselves that they was leery about going back . They also bore that shame , and when they did run across other Human Beings would rest their chins on the chest and look out of the sides of their eyes if at all . ' I hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say the Shy Folks . Now Old Lodge Skins became their leader , having proved himself wise and brave and generous , and the time come when they was invited hack to the Burnt Arteries on the occasion of the sun dance where all the tribe joins together . By God if that Indian did n't get into the same kind of trouble as his Dad  --  a vein of horniness run right through the family  --  he swiped the wife of a man from the 1 lair Rope hand and though he left two horses as payment the other fellow did n't like the deal and come after him and in the set-to got an arrow through the windpipe and choked to death . Skins did n't bother to come back to that dance after that , but was joined by the rest of his family out on the prairie and they wandered by themselves again for years . Somewhere along the line they was reinstated . By the time I joined up , they could go to the allCheyenne get-togethers but was not encouraged to camp in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time . But now that fat girl had got just about the last eligible husband in our camp , for the Cheyenne wo n't stand for incest and we had n't picked up any new people since the coming of Yellow Eagle , who was now dead leaving two widows and a tepeeful of orphans which Shadow That Conies in Sight had to adopt . I do n't think Old Lodge Skins can be condemned for deciding to move south again when spring got well under way , though it defied his intention to keep clear of the whites . We had to get some fresh blood before we could let some more , and most of the other Cheyenne was down below the Platte . There were Sioux up around the  | Powder , and they was our fighting allies , but Skins was quite the snob when it come to family connections . He never forgot that version of Cheyenne history which he mentioned to the Minneconjou : the Human Beings had horses when the Lakota was still using dogs . He did n't spell it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was how the women come to strike camp and make travois of the lodgepoles , on which they packed the folded tepee skins and the rest of the gear , and did the same with the lighter articles onto the bigger dogs , including among the baggage certain small kids lashed atop it , and those of us with horses mounted them and some walked , and in a great messy caravan stretched for a mile , the warriors riding flank , we wended southward , leaving a wide trail of horse dung , wornout apparel , cleaned bones , and the ashes of many old campfires . I was on the way to becoming a white man again , although I never suspected it at the time . l We traveled all the way to the Solomon 's Fork of the Kansas River , in the north of the present-day state of the latter name , and there in a great camp covering a mile or more of bottomland we found the entire Cheyenne nation , who except for us had wintered together the preceding season . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to that point , and it made me proud : probably a thousand lodges in the configuration of a circle , with the tepees of each band making a little circle within the greater . And all the bands was there : the Hair Rope , the Scabby People , etc. , which were hitherto known to me only in narrative , not to mention the military societies such as the Dog Soldiers , who acted as a police force , and t he Contraries who do everything backwards . Old Lodge Skins was sort of uneasy when we was riding in : I could see that , for an Indian 's face is as expressive as anybody 's when he is among his own , but nobody tried to stop us and nobody came up and asked : " Where are you going ? What do you want ? " which they would have done to someone who did not belong , and after a while I could see , beneath his chiefly dignity , that the old man was considerable relieved . Shortly out come some headmen from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inviting our bunch to camp in their circle . The old crime had been washed out . So everything was per-  | feet and they had taken buffalo on a big ritualistic hunt up on the headwaters of the Republican River , so we all had to eat six or seven consecutive meals that day because every Indian who saw you would pull you into his lodge and press a feast on you . Then there was some speechifying by the orators and songs by the singers , and some ( lancing by the heemaneh  --  with whom Little Horse now definitely threw in his lot  --  which was very graceful and well received . And gossip was exchanged on every hand , Shadow That Conies in Sight told his jokes , and gifts were presented back and forth and it got to be a problem to remember what you had left to give the next guy without passing on something you had just received . I was in the middle of all this . There were those among the new people N% ho sired me up , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they all got it straight , but I never had to undergo one embarrassing moment , except maybe owing to the excess of approval that was manifested after Old Lodge Skins , Burns Red , and I it tie 1 lorse done their bragging about me . Everything seemed to be swell , but after purely Indian matters had been pretty well gone over , up came the subject of the whites and that was like a storm sky obscuring the sun . The spring before , there had been a difficulty over four horses which the Cheyenne said were strays found roaming the prairie but the soldiers claimed as their own , so they killed one Human Being and put another into the post guardhouse , where he died . Then in the summer a party of young men came across a mail wagon and asked the driver for some tobacco , but lie shot at them , so they put an arrow in his arm and the next day the troops attacked their camp , killing six Indians and stealing their horses . As the Cheyenne was fleeing from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they took revenge upon the whites and killed two men and a child . There had been other troubles , with a chief called Big Head wounded while on a friendly visit to Dort Kearny . The Cheyenne felt especial put upon , for by their lights they had always been amiable to white men . Even after all these bad things , they sent a delegation to see the Government Indian agent and apologized . They also returned a woman they had captured . But you see the complication was this : Indians was n't ever organized . Them that come in to apologize was n't the same as what killed the whites . And them that the soldiers usually punished was never the ones who had  | nimitted the outrages . The white people on whom the Indians ) k revenge had no connection with the soldiers . It was pretty early on that I come to realize that most serious Nations in life , or my life anyway , were like that time I rubbed tit the Crow : he spared me because I was white , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't nothing else either of us could have done , and it would have been ridiculous except it was ' mortal . Anyhow , the Cheyenne now had got to believing they might soon have to destroy all the white men on the plains , an idea that did n't seem altogether preposterous when you saw the size of that camp . Even I got to entertaining the possibility : we could ourselves ttiuunt maybe fifteen hundred warriors , and we was now friends with the Kiowa and Comanche who lived just south , and our old pals the Arapaho would help and the Sioux from the north . I was making out all right as an Indian and did n't figure on losing any sleep over what happened to my native race when I thought of how little they had ever done for me . Besides , there was n't any talk of invading St. Louis or Chicago  --  or Evansville  --  which is where white people belonged . That was before I heard the oratory of the medicine men : two of t hem , named Ice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do was make certain motions towards the soldiers , and when the latter fired their guns the bullets would roll slowly down the barrels and fall harmless to the earth . I used to stand along the path that Nothing took when she went to the river for water , and as she passed I 'd grab the fringe on her skirt and give a little tug , then let go . About the only compensation I got for it was that she did n't show no more attention to Coyote , who was also now stuck on her , than to me . He and I would take turns in paying her notice : such as that if I was waiting for her on the river path , he would let that go and try to approach her when she was gathering buffalo chips . Since neither of us was yet getting anywhere , we was n't jealous of each other and maintained the neutral relations me and Coyote had always had . You know how it is : you have your friends and enemies , and then there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave : same way among Indians . I also had developed an Indian sense of time . I must have been about fifteen when we was on the Solomon 's Fork , and I had this  | crush on Nothing but I was n't any more impatient in regard to it than she was : the Cheyenne take five years or so to court their women and even so I was young to be starting now . I 'll bet you never knowed redskins was so slow in this area . But being warriors , the Cheyenne like to keep themselves bottled up . You try fighting sometime after going at it hard and you 'll see the point : you 'll just want to sleep . Well sir , it was interesting to be in that big camp with all the activities and pretty soon they held a sun dance which went on for eight days of highly elaborate doings that would n't mean anything to an individual not of that persuasion , but it reaffirmed the Human Beings in their sense of superiority , if it was possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close competition . In the self-tortures Younger Bear distinguished himself of course . He ripped the pegs out of his chest within fifteen minutes after their being attached , and had them hooked into new places and hung against the rawhide lines all night long . Next day his whole upper body was lilac an open sore , and he did n't treat it with salve or mud or anything hut strutted around with the blood drying . Now you might call it typical of the Cheyenne that after all the talk of how they was going to wipe out the whites , and all the ceremony that fitted them to do so , they began to break up the camp and move off with a purpose to keep out of trouble . After all that , it would have seemed like an anticlimax to go and really fight , and Indians , who war among themselves all the time , did n't get no pleasure out of tangling with white men , which was a nasty business even if von won . The hands traveled individually but for some distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tribe as a whole was divided most of the year into a larger segment that roamed as separate parrs about the Platte , and another that hung around the fort of William Bent the trader , on the Purgatory and Arkansas rivers down iuu southern Colorado . We who followed Old Lodge Skins was of course Northern Cheyenne and now moved with the . Burnt Artery band in that direction . I should say before we get too far along that we had done a good bit of business at that gathering and married off most of our available females , whose husbands was now with us . That and his acceptance back into his proper band had put Old Lodge Skins in such a good mood that I figure he would have got into trouble again  | der the wrong buffalo robe had not camp been struck when it s . I had seen him flickering his ruttish old eyes at several fat tires . I myself as yet did n't have a horny thought towards Not hg , just would have liked to hear her shy , soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We had n't got far when our scouts come back with the report of tP column of troops about half a day 's ride ahead , moving our way . Now at the big camp they had had a few flintlocks , so about three of our warriors was now armed in this fashion , and Hump , who had been waiting for years for this eventuality , wanted to ride on and fight the soldiers . But Old Lodge Skins and the head chiefs of the ! Burnt Arteries was concerned for the women and children , so we turned and went back south in search of our other folks . Traveling cast , we caught up with some of the southern people and reassembled with them again near the Solomon 's Fork . It was n't the whole crowd from before , but we had maybe three hundred fighting men wt-*i say ten or fifteen flintlocks which seemed to the Cheyenne pretty formidable armament . The excitement was so great I did n't have no time to work out my new point of view : I had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annihilation of the paleface on the western prairie was n't no skin off my arse : I did n't know a white man west of St. Joe except for the remnants of my own family who by now must long have reached Salt Lake . But when I studied that out , I never actually saw myself participating in such a massacre . Now here was a battle coming up with the U.S. Cavalry and I was passing for a Cheyenne warrior of some repute . I had the choice of being a coward or either kind of traitor . I remember wishing we was still lighting the Crow . It sure was a serious problem , but all the time I considered it I was stripping down , daubing myself with red and yellow war paint , and honing the heads of my arrows on a little whetstone . There are some who in moments of indecision cease all bodily movement so as to give free play to the mind , but I 'm the other type : I give employment to my hands , figuring my brain will follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't no reason to believe I 'd have got any farther by sitting with my chin on my knuckles . We sent the women and children off south below the Arkansas , although owing to the confidence the Cheyenne had at this moment they set up the lodges again and left them standing . Then Ice the  | medicine man led us to a little lake nearby , in which we made ourselves invulnerable by dipping our hands in the water . When the soldiers fired we 'd just put up our palms and the balls would barely clear the muzzles and dribble to the ground . That was when the whole business cleared up for me : I was going to die . You can go so far with Indians and then that sort of thing comes up . I know the medicine of heft-I landed Wolf had cured me of my head wound , but I believe that happened because I was unconscious during most of the healing , and when you are out of your right mind there do n't seem to he any rules as to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can take a fall that when sober would mash him like a tomato . I do n't want to be no bigot : I 'm not saying that under no conditions can a rifle ball he stopped by magic . What I 'm saying is that it ai n't going to be stopped by someone who do n't believe it can be done as applied to himself . Which was me . So far as Hump went , or Burns Red in the Sun , or Younger Bear , that was their lookout . If you been listening close you might have caught me up back a ways itt the part about fighting the Crow . That first one I killed had found I was white even in the dark : what about those we rode against in the daytime ? I painted my face and body , but how about my red hair ? I 'll tell you . After all the enthusiasm over my first exploit , I certainly did n't want to mention the peculiar conditions of it to any ? of the Iluman Beings , for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc. , would only have confused them to hear about . But when we rode out in war , I had represented my problem to Old bodge Skins in this style : " Grandfather , " I said , which is how you address a man of his age , " I want to do something and do n't know the proper waYI do n't want the Crow to see the color of my head , and yet I do n't want them to think I have been such a coward as to cut off my hair so I ca n't be scalped . I ant still too young and have taken too few coups to wear a full war bonnet . " ' The chief thought this over , and then he took his plug hat and put it on my head . It was a bit big and carne down to my ears , but all a the better for coverage . " Whenever you fight , you may wear this , " he said , " but give it back between times because it goes with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the whites . " And that 's what I did , stuffing a little padding inside the band so  | it 'd be snugger and tying it to my chin with a rawhide cord . As to the hair on my nape , I 'd run the paint up to cover that . I still did n't have no braids , of course , and the Crow probably did n't take me for to ioo per cent Cheyenne , for Indians have sharp eyes even in the press of war , but I could have been a breed . Now we were about to go against the troops , so I went to where Old Lodge Skins with the other leaders was planning our order of battle , they doing this in a formal way like with a trained army , and I caught his attention and asked for the hat , which he was then wearing . I Ie drew me aside ; in fact , we both mounted and rode up on the bluffs above the river , him on one of his marvelous pintos that did his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the highest point we stopped , and he looked into the distances and remarked there was 250 horse soldiers about five miles off , followed two or three miles behind by a body of infantry . I could n't see a goddam thing but the swelling prairie . Then he put his bright old eyes on me and said : " My son , those are white people that we are going to destroy . This will be the first time I have ever faced the whites as an enemy . I have always believed they had a reason for what they did , and I still do . They are strange and do not seem to know where the center of the world is . And because of that , I have never liked them but never hated them either . However , recently they have been behaving badly towards the Human Beings . Therefore we must rub them out . He looked sort of embarrassed and scratched his nose . " I do n't know whether you can remember back that far , before you became a Human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I made with Buffalo Wallow Woman and the others , filling my heart with pride and bringing honor to my tepee . . . . I shall not speak of that earlier time , which has probably been washed from your memory . I just wish to say that if you do recall it and believe riding against these white-skinned ones would be bad medicine , you can stay out of the fight and no one will think the worse . You have proved manytimes you are a man , and a man must do what is in his heart and no one can question it . " l lc would n't say I was white , see , but was giving me an out if I wanted one . With his usual arrogance he assumed anybody who had the chance would rather be Cheyenne ; but with his consideration ,  | which was no less habitual , he was acknowledging the fact of my birth . " Grandfather , " I said , " I think it is a good day to die . " You tell that to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or telling you you 're wrong , that everything 's going to be swell , etc. , for it ai n't the hollow speech it would be among whites . Nor is it suicidal , like somebody who takes the attitude that life has gone stale for him , so he 's going to throw it over . What it means is you will fight until you 're all used up . Far from being sour , life is so sweet you will live it to the hilt and be consumed by it . One time before I joined the tribe a hand of Cheyenne caught the cholera from some emigrants and those that was n't yet dying got into battle dress , mounted their war ponies , and challenged the invisible disease to come out and light like a man . I do n't honestly know whether I was saying it in the Indian sense , but Old Lodge Skins took it so and give me the plug hat . A jackrabhit appeared at that moment and sat there within easy range , wrinkling its nose at him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bottomland . It was several years before I talked to him again . The troops reached the river about two miles to the west and then began to move downstream towards us . They knowed we was in the vicinity hut it held a certain surprise for them to come round a bend of the Solomon and find three hundred Cheyenne horsemen waiting in line of battle , our left flank against the river and our right under the bluffs . The IIunian Beings was in full regalia , warriors and ponies painted , feat hers galore , a good many in the full bonnet , the sun picking up the gaudy colors and glinting off lance heads and musket barrels . Sonic of the braves was talking to their horses , those animals prancing and breathing through expanded nostrils as if they was already charging . They smelled the big cavalry mounts and began fiercely to whinny , having the same attitude to them that the human Cheyenne had to the whites . I was riding a buckskin , one of those taken in that Crow raid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make his way through life without much commentary aside from the normal greetings . Right now was the closest I ever come to discussing philosophical matters with him . I was real nervous owing to my suspi-  | n that not all my comrades took Old Lodge Skins 's position on y presence in the middle of the first rank . Especially Younger ur , who had been down on the right wing but seeing me rode up d wedged a place for his pony alongside . He was painted dead ack from waist up , with vermilion in the part of his hair , his eyes out lined in white and horizontal white bars across his cheeks . I could n't tell whether he was grinning at me or just baring his teeth ; it was the first notice he had paid me in a long time . I did n't ( ct urn it ; I was n't feeling at all well , and was sure grateful for the war paint I had on myself . That 's the wonderful thing about paint : hu matter how you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other fighting leaders was riding up and down the line and the medicine man Ice was also there , uttering his mumbojumbo and shaking rattles , buffalo tails , and other junk towards the cavalry , which had stopped a half mile away on the bottom and wined to be just studying us . I was hoping they would maybe start laughing themselves to death : the soldiers , I mean . Because that 's hat I was inclined to do . You get this funny excitement before a charge ; and the longer it takes to get under way , the more intense it becomes , so that when you finally go , you are doing what you need more than anything in the world at that point . But add to the situation that I was naked and wearing the plug hat , that we was facing some three or four hundred white men carrying firearms , and that I was in my fifth year of pretending to be an Indian  --  I found myself laughing my guts out no doubt preparatory to their being filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to muffle this , so that it sounded like a mumble or a deep guttural chant as a matter of fact , like a natural Cheyenne thing . It seemed to impress Younger Bear , for he took it up , and then the next braves on either side , and pretty soon it was sounding from every chest and had turned into the Cheyenne war song , and we began to move forward on its music at the walk , some of the ponies dancing out but the front rank generally dressed . We was still holding back our power , bottling it up while working the charm , paralyzing them whites by our magic as we walked in the sacred way . I forgot about myself , being just a part of the mystical circle in which the Cheyenne believed they were continuously joined , which is the round of the earth and the sun , and life and death too , for the disjunction between them is a matter of appearance and not the true  | substance , so that every Cheyenne who has ever lived and those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Human Beings , of all nature the supreme product . We had proceeded maybe two-three hundred yards in this fast , ion , the troops still watching us , obviously charmed like the ante lope in that surround and about to be similarly butchered  --  a nuns ber of our warriors had indeed slung their bows and were grasping 1 , war clubs and hatchets , expecting to knock the helpless soldier , from the saddle  --  when there was a multiple glitter from the blue ranks and above our song come the brass staccato of the bugle call . They had drawn sabers and next they charged . We stopped . There was six hundred yards of river bottom between them and us . Soon it was down to four , then three , and our Ilh singing petered out . ' Hie bugle was done by now , and no sound was heard but the thumping of a thousand iron-shod hoofs intermixed ! with scabbard jangle . And speaking for myself I never saw guidons nor uniforms nor even horses but rather a sort of device , one big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust all life before it and spewed it out behind for a quarter mile of rising yellow cloud . Now we was the paralyzed , and froze to our ground until the oncoming ranks was within one hundred yards , then seventy-five , and then we burst into fragments and fled in uttermost rout . The magic , you sec , had been good against bullets , not the long knives . I say " we " for effect . Actually , at a certain razor 's , or saber 's , edge of choice , I cut clean my Cheyenne ties , pitched Old Lodge Skins 's hat to the earth where it was shortly churned into trash by galloping hoofs , and with the free-swinging sash of my breechclout began to scrub the paint off my face , all the while yelling in English , which I had n't spoke for five years , so some of my urgency went into rhetorical matters . What do you say at such a time that wo n't make you sound like more of an Indian ? Idly vocabulary was real limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination ai n't at its best when a six-foot trooper , mounted on a huge bay , is thundering down on you with 1 his pigsticker and all around is similar gentry pursuing your late family and friends who is running like stampeded buffalo . Here 's what I said . I shouted : " God bless George Washington ! " In between I was scrubbing my forehead on that breechclout flap , for which I had to bend forward in the saddle . Which saved my life ,  | for that big trooper sickled his blade across precisely where my am 's apple would have been under normal conditions . Well , that usiness about Washington had n't worked , so as he wheeled for a cond swing , backhand , I yelled : " God bless my Mother ! " To evade his savage chop I had to go down on the offside of my my , Indian-style , clinging by my shins , and rode in a circle while e dogged me all along , slashing the air but it made a fearsome icker . Meanwhile the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be hacked from behind before this son of a bitch either it me or understood what I was getting at . For he was big , and I o n't care what you say , for every inch a man grows over five foot vc , his brain diminishes proportionately . All my life I have had a prejudice against overgrown louts. ' l'his dodging went on long enough and with enough variations so I saw he could never touch me , on the one hand , and would never ' top trying , on the other . He was n't much of a horseman : at the end f every slash the momentum of his saber-wielding arm would pull up the far knee and loosen his seat while the animal veered . He done this once too often , and I poked my moccasin over into his ribs and with a sudden jolt unhorsed him in a clatter of scabbard and spurs and the rest of that overload the soldier boys toted . I dropped off my pony , trailing the war bridle from my belt , put a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of my scalping knife across his bristly throat  --  the blunt side , in case temptation offered . All of a sudden I recalled a number of choice phrases I had heard from grownups around Evansville . " Now , you , " I says with great energy . " Do I have to cut your throat to get it through your thick head that I 'm a white man ? " His dumb look never altered , but he said : " Then why in hell are you dressed like that ? " " It 's a long story , " says I , and let him up .  | So the colonel expressed his sympathies , then tried to get some information out of me as to the location of the Cheyenne lodges and horse herd , as he proposed to burn the first and capture the second , but I acted as if rendered half idiotic by the tortures I had under went for years and so eluded that . It turned out he found the camp anyway by merely following the trail , and burned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Lodge Skins 's was not among them ; Buffalo Wallow Woman and White Cow Woman must have took time to fold it up before fleeing . From there on , that general trail burst into manly little ones , as is the Indian practice for evasion . The warriors , who had gone off to the east , would circle around later . Everybody would get together at some later time when the danger was over . The Army tucked about that area most of the summer , at one point going as far west as Bent 's Fort and seizing the supplies there that was supposed to go as annuity payments to the Indians under Ip the existing treaty , then coming back to the Solomon again . But they never found no more Cheyenne and at length returned to Fort I.:u  --  atniC . I had of course been with them this while , being looked after by Aluldoon , who found it convenient to forget I could have killed hint with my hands tied behind me and pretend I was a helpless kid . Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He used to make me wash a lot with strong Army soap , claiming I still stunk like a goat for weeks alter I had left the Cheyenne . I believed he did , and the rest of them soldiers ; but it was just a case of relative smells , I expect , and I could recall what had seemed to me the stench of the Cheyenne camp when inc and Caroline had entered it years before . The other soldiers treated me the same , and other than having to listen to a lot of their stupid talk , I never actually suffered . On a campaign like that was an easier way to break back into white life than any other . At least we was outdoors and slept on the ground , and though that Army grub , chiefly sowbelly and hardtack , was garbage , I shot some game now and again , for I had retained my bow and arrow and my Cheyenne pony , and the soldiers liked red meat too , so that made me quite popular with them though I never talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of captivity . You might have thought the colonel would be interested in my experiences of five years ' barbarism , but he was n't . I was n't long in  | recovering that it is a rare person in the white world who wants to tltear what the other fellow says , all the more so when the other fellow really knows what he is talking about . HI say this , my medicine failed when we got to Laramie . I had not had anything in mind when I went white at the Solomon battle , except to save my life while not retreating . I sure did n't figure out what such a decision would entail in the long run . I was away from civilization so many years that I forgot how everything is organized there : you do n't just move into someone 's tepee and let it go at that . For example , we had n't been long at Laramie , where I was still bunking with the soldiers , when the colonel sent for me . " The records in this department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The unfortunate incident in which the red fiends assaulted your father 's wagons has never been entered , so far as we can determine from our files . I 'm afraid punishment of the particular malefactors will be rather difficult owing to the insufficient information you have so far provided as to their identity  --  this of course added to the problem of laying our hands on the Indians concerned were they even to be clearly identified . " For as you know they are a wily lot . Eventually , I suppose , we will be forced to kill them all off  --  I can see no other possibility in the face of their savage obduracy against setting aside the life of the brute . " So much for those unhappy memories . The important thing is I the life that opens before you , " and so on , the upshot of which was he sent me east to Fort Leavenworth , the departmental headquartcrs , with a column that was going there the next day . Leavenworth was on the Missouri River , right near Westport , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Pa bought his wagon and team of ox . This was civilization , or what passed for it in them days , in the extreme . I got a choking . sensation when I heard the news . There was already so many white men around Laramie you could hardly breathe , and I did n't sleep well in them rectangular barracks , on account of having been trained by the Cheyenne to favor the circular dwelling . I think I have mentioned their feeling about circles , the circle of the earth and so on . They was set against the ninety-degree angle , which brought continuity to a dead stop . Old Lodge Skins used to say : " There 's no power in a square . " Now I was going back to a whole world of sharp corners , while  | somewhere out on the prairie the Human Beings had collected again , and having keened for their dead , was eating roast hump and dreaming and telling stories by the buffalo-chip fire and stealing ponies from the Pawnee and getting theirs stole in return , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of white antelope . They knew about where 1 was , although they might not let been told , the way they knew about everything that concerned their people and nothing else . They would n't have heard of of understood the slavery troubles , John Brown and all that was going on in white h ; tnsas at the time . But I never regretted leaving Laramie as such , which had grom n into as ugly a place as you could find  --  that 's what I thought then before I seen many other white places . A lot of Indians pitched thcii tents thereabout , among them I 'm sorry to say certain Human Be ings , but they did n't resemble the ones I had known , and the i.ndi victual tribes was not so important as that they all belonged to degraded type known as the Hang About the Forts . The free-roving , hands did n't think much of them . A good many of these gentr ' literally just sat around their stockade in their blankets , looking stupidly at what went on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if a soldier wanted the space they occupied he would roust theft ) nut of it , like shooing a dog . Some did a little trading in second rate skins , and sonic prostituted their women , and all of them sub sisted on ( , overtunent handouts give to them for being " friendlies . These last of course was usually less than half of what they was authorized by law , for the Indian agents withheld the rest and sold it to white emigrants or the Army seized it for their own use on account of the quartermaster 's stores was generally insufficient owing to crooked purveyors back East or thieving supply officers . It was also against the law to sell liquor to the Indians , but the Hang Around the Forts was oftener drunk than not , for the troopers would sneak them whiskey in exchange for a roll with their wives and daughters , a sorry lot but presumably better than nothing ? few white women was to be had thereabouts . Also the traders did quite a good business in firewater , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it , probably ? because when drunk the fort Indians was even more harmless than when in possession of their faculties . I mention this subject because while I was at Laramie I run into someone I knowed from the old days . I had wandered among the  | dian camp out of nostalgia for my old life , but I was about to be men back to the fort by dirty old squaws trying to sell me mangv 11'alo robes and their whoremaster husbands , grinning and snivelg , when I saw a canvas tent pitched there out of which from time time an Indian buck would stagger and then maybe fall flat fore he reached his destination or puke all over the ground . A number of braves was inside when I poked in , each singing a ' tfcrent song or orating hoarsely to nobody in particular . The ell was indescribable . At the back of the tent was an open barrel with a rusty dipper hanging on it , and alongside stood a white man dressed in filthy buckskins . He looked as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born ; you could have peeled the dirt off it Ice a rind . He also never owned a razor . " I Iow 're ya , partner , " says he , showing his mossy teeth . One of the Indians lurched over then , and taking off his moccasins , handed ; hens to this sowish fellow , who after examination of the articles ' takes his head . So the Indian pulls off his shirt , which was a gray ool trade item , black with grease , and hands that over . The white fellow puts up his first finger , with the top two joints Ided down , and says : " Half , you brown-arsed son of a bitch . Half , ou shit-eater . " And half-fills the rusty dipper , and the Indian takes and pours it down his throat . " Have one on me , " the white man invites yours truly . I just look at him , and he says : " I do n't mean of this horse piss . I rot a bottle of the real stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ground , while stuffing into it the shirt and moccasins he has lust obtained . " For that in the barrel I use a pint of whiskey per gallon , add gunpowder , tobacco , sulfur , tabasco , and black pepper , then water t up to level . These skunks do n't know the difference . But I swear that this here is the good . Drink up . " He pushes the bottle at me . " No , thanks , " I says . " Well , stay anyway . I do n't get much chance for conversation during the day , dealing with these . " He upends the bottle and lets it gurgle , and one of the Indians sees it and staggers towards him , but he kicks him in the groin and the Indian , who from his braids is a Cheyenne , falls to the ground and passes out . The others do n't pay no attention to this incident . " Of course , " the fellow says , lowering the bottle , " I generally goes over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ com-  | manding officer , a personal friend of mine , but during the day I 1 i pretty lonely . It ai n't easy for me to deal with this trash , consideri they murdered my whole family in front of my eyes and all the women in it . I reckon when Kansas becomes a state one I these years , I 'll go up to Congress for Senator . " He took anotii swallow . " Sure you do n't want to take a pull of this ? It 's still got th , hair on it . " But I turned my back on him and , stepping across that recumbeno Human Being , left the tent . I did n't drink whiskey as yet , and I never could stand to hear die lies of my brother Bill . I was just grateful he did n't recognize nte . At I , cavcnworth , quite a big fort , I was quartered with an Arnh chaplain who had a little , house for himself and family . This was f1 skinnv horse-toothed fellow with a wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't look like eithc of ticni . I staved there for several weeks , during which time when ever the wife and kids was out of the house and I was there with the chaplain , he 'd ask me into his office and start talking oily about m ' , spiritual vveil-being , in the course of which to make his point he 'd lay a spidery hand on my knee . I think he was a heemaneh though he never went farther . I was n't sorry to leave when the time come , for in addition to that , his wife claimed I still stunk and made m ( bathe a lot . Ar last I vaS called in to see the head officer there , a general with whiskers , and he said : " Well now , Jack , we 've got a fine home for you . You 'll be schooled and get proper clothes and have a splendid 1 father to loop after you . You have a lot to catch up with , but you'rc a bright boy . And if in later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow the guidon with our brave boys , I 'll be glad to let you use my name . " With that he stuck his head into a pile of papers , and his orderly led me outside to where that Army chaplain I had stayed with was talking to an enormous fat nian sitting in a buggy . I just want to say here that was the first and last time I saw the general . Nobody at Leavenworth ever asked me a word about the Indians I have lived among for five years . But neither had it ocVcurred to the Cheyenne to ask me about the ways of the white man , not even when they was being destroyed by them . You got to knock a man down and put your knife at his throat before he 'll hear  | u , like I did to that trooper . The truth seems hateful to most crybody . So I was brought outside to that buggy , and the chaplain says : Ire 's our little savage now . " The other man had a square-cut beard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but his belly was too great to fasten it across . His t was hard and not soft , if you know what I mean . The old-time ong men used to be like that , with enormous potbellies that was t but felt like muscle if you hit them there . I had seen pictures of midi , and I thought maybe that 's what this fellow was . So I immediately got the idea we 'd be traveling around to the opera houses , giving shows , lifting sixteen midgets with one hand , breaking iron chains and all , for the chaplain says : " Jack , this is the dood man who has graciously consented to adopt you . You must onor him as you would your own Papa , for that 's what he has become by law . " The fat man glanced at me over his beard , shifted his powerful shoulders , and said in a voice as deep as if it echoed from a canyon bottom : " Can you drive a wagon , boy ? " I admired him and wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right good . " " You 're a liar , boy , " he growled . " For where 'd you learn to drive a wagon if you have been reared by the Indians ? We shall have to beat the lying out of you . " He leaned down , grabbed my shirtfront , and lifted me into the buggy with only his left arm . It was like being levered up with the trunk of a tree . The chaplain squealed : " Oh , Jack , you must be respectful to the Reverend and show him that you learned at least some manners in your short time among us . " That was it : my new Pa was not a theatrical performer but another goddam preacher , as if I had n't had my quota of them , and his name was the Reverend Silas Pendrake . In addition to that black beard , he had thick black eyebrows , and his skin was white as dried pipe clay . He sure looked mean . I had retained my scalping knife in the waistband of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I considered putting it into his spine as we drove towards the Missouri River . But I was discouraged by the look of his enormous spread , which run about four foot from shoulder to shoulder and almost as thick through . I believed my blade would snap off against It , as if you 'd stab a stone wall .  | That knife and Muldoon 's six-foot clothes comprised my tot . l property . They took my pony when we got to Leavenworth and I never saw it again . I think the chaplain sold it to compensate for tn ' keep , and his tow-haired kids got to playing with my Cheyenne bow and broke it . At the river Pendrake drove his buggy right onto the deck of a stern-wheel boat that was sitting there . His horse by the way was a big , patient gray animal ; and you might figure how strong he was to pull his gigantic owner . That horse was a might leery of me , as I could tell from the curve of his nostrils : I reckon he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least four or five times all over in the months since leaving the tribes . After a while they got that boat going , and it was interesting but I did n't like it much because I remembered Old Lodge Skins would mention that if a I Inman Being , anyway , went over much water lw would die . Of course I had been raised on the Ohio at Evansville , but that was long ago , and the Missouri to look at wo n't build your confidence . It is always undermining its banks before your eyes , and I reckon that if enough years go by it will have worked its way out to Nevada and be irrigating them deserts . I ai n't going to tell you where we was heading , except it was a fairly prominent town in western Missouri . The reason for my delicacy will be clearly apparent in the sequel , as they say . So we 'll just go on here from where we docked after a trip of some hours , and drove off the boat , and through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'endrakc had himself a proper church and next door to it a two-story house of some substance , with a barn in back into which he run the buggy , and said to me the first words I can recall he uttered since leaving Leavenworth : " Do you know how to unhitch a wagon , boy ? " NI had learned my lesson . " No , I do n't , sir , " says I. " Not a-tall . " " Then you must figure out how to do so , " he rumbles , though not nearly as mean as he talked at Leavenworth , and I immediately got the idea that maybe his manner there was intended to offset the mincing ways of that chaplain , so I would n't think all preachers was alike . I 'll tell you right now about Pendrake : he never seemed to know how to act natural except when eating ; otherwise he appeared to be trying to live up to an obligation to someone or something else . I think if he 'd of cut himself , he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to do was put on a bandage .  | Well , it was n't hard to study out how to unhitch that horse , and pile from tossing his head some , but doing that slow and heavy , the tnnnal did n't give me no trouble , and I got him in the stall . After that was done , though , I was in a quandary , on account of I still d n't have no faith that Pendrake would n't take a marvelous price r it bad guess . If I stayed in the stable and he expected me up at the house , there might be hell to pay . On the other hand , if I went to the house , maybe he 'd rather I stayed in the barn . I decided for movement , as usual , and headed for the house , but instead of going Into the back door which he had used , walked around to the front , thinking I 'd avoid him for a time that way and also get the lay of fhc building in case I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the porch and through the front door , and into a II where a hatrack stood fashioned of deer antlers , then stepped to a parlor which I expect would n't look like much today but it as then a wondrous sight to me with the brass coal-oil lamps and dies on the furniture to keep off hair-grease , for though Pendrake ' was n't exactly wealthy , he sure was n't seedy like my folks had been Ind was n't Army like that chaplain . Then that great voice said behind me : " You 're in the parlor ? " He was n't exactly outraged by it , just dumfounded . " I did n't break nothing , " says I. I had n't turned till then . When I did , expecting to see his hulk directly behind me , he was actually farther away than I thought . With that voice of his , he could be a hundred yards distant and still Muuid on your neck . But now , between him and me , was a woman with dark-blonde hair drawn across either side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lehe had blue eyes and pale skin , though not the dead white of his , nd wore a blue dress . I reckoned she was about twenty years of age while Pendrake was fifty , so believed her his daughter . She was smiling at me and had teeth smaller than average over a lull underlip . She kept looking at me but talked to Pendrake . " I do n't think he 's ever seen a parlor before , " she said velvety loft . " Would you like to sit down , Jack ? Right here , " pointing out a kind of bench covered in green plush . " That 's called a loveseat . " Pendrake sort of growled deep in his windpipe , not in rage but rat her a sort of stupor . I said : " No thank you , ma'am . " And then she asked if I wanted a glass of milk and a piece of cake . There was n't nothing I wanted less than milk , for which if I 'd  | ever had a taste I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone with this girl if I was going to have a friend in that house , followed on to the kitchen and by so doing got out of Pendrake way for a while at least , for he went to a room off the parlor when he wrote his sermons and sometimes spoke them aloud ; you could hear him rumbling through the woodwork and the glassware would tinkle all through the place . In the kitchen I Hier another individual who was friendly righo off . She did n't have no other choice , being colored . Though freed , she was n't acting cocky about it , I can tell you , for it was within tii law in Missouri of that day to keep slaves . I guess once you 've becii one , you always figure you can be made into one again . She got on my nerves slightly , however , with her everlasting good humor , which I suspect was partly fake , and I 'd have had more in common with her great-grandpa who carried a spear in Africa . This cook ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fellow who worked around the place outside , cutting grass and all , another freedman l ) the name of I.avcnder . They lived in a little cottage out beyond the stable , and I could sometimes hear them arguing out there in the middle of the night . That white woman which I took for Pendrake 's daughter wa ' , actually his wife . She was older by five or six years than I had firs ! thought , just as he was some younger . Still , there was quite a range between than and I already wondered that first afternoon what she saw in him . And I might as well say now I never found out , either . I reckon it was one of them marriages arranged by the parents , for her Pa had been a judge and such a fellow would n't want a saloonkeeper for a son-in-law . Mrs. I ' . now sat across the table while I drunk the milk , and impressed me by the interest she took in my early life , or seemed to . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which surprised me in a refined white woman in the Missouri settlements , whereas that colored Lucy , though laughing incessantly and saying " Lordy , " could n't have cared less and I knew figured me for a mighty liar . I saw I had a good thing in my stories , so did n't exhaust them all at once . I also tried to mind the eating manners showed me by that chaplain 's wife , where the first time I set down to table I picked the meat off the plate with my hands . I knowed better now and cut that cake Mrs. Pendrake give me bit by bit and daintily inserted it into my mouth on the point of a knife .  | Wlicn I was done , she said : " You do n't know how glad we arc to ac you with us , Jack . There are n't any other young people in this use . Your coming has let the sun in . " I thought it was a pretty thing sa v. Next thing she did was take me shopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parasol , and her and me walked into the allInercial part of town , for it was not far and the day was fine cat her in early October as I recall . We come across a number of ogle that Mrs. Pendrake knowed and they gawked at me and nictimes talked with her as to my identity . The women generally ale a clucking noise and sort of simpered , though I drew a bellignt look from certain of them who were old maids , schoolteachlibrarians , and such , for I had n't got a proper haircut in five cars and probably had a nasty expression in spite of my efforts to ) k decent . As to the men we encountered , I do n't believe a one of them uld have told you later whether I was tall or short , for they kept cir eyes fixed on Mrs. P. She had quite an effect on them . I do n't Iicve I done her justice in the description , which I have tried to II from my point of view that first day . As I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic taste in women was for black it and dark eyes . She was also supposed to be my adopted Ma , so I as restrained somewhat from looking at her purely as a woman . ut it 's only fair to say that with white men I reckon Mrs. Pendrake as thought to be indeed a beauty , and most of them we met that $fternoon acted like they 'd have got down on their knees and hung out their tongues if she 'd of asked them to .  | page deleted  | page deleted  | say , to somewhat less than the average intake of a white man who never misses his three square . But Pendrake laid into it day in and day out , and I 'm going to tell you what he 'd eat on any one of them , for you wo n't have an idea of that man without knowledge of his appetite . For breakfast Lucy would fry him six eggs , a great mass of potatoes , and a steak about the size of his two giant hands put together . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to his belly with a couple quarts of coffee , she 'd deliver the griddle cakes , ten or twelve surmounted by a hunk of butter big as an apple and dripping wit Ii molasses . For lunch he 'd eat two entire chickens with stuffing , potatoes , couple vegetables , five pieces of bread , and half a pie swimming in cream . In the afternoon he 'd make calls on sick parishioners , and they would n't never be so under the weather that they could n't sec to it he got an enormous hunk of cake or a dozen cookies along with coffee or tea . Then came slipper . He 'd drink a bowl of soup into which he broke so much bread it was more solid than liquid . Next would be a platter of fish , then a huge roast of beef which he would single handed reduce to the bone after me and Mrs. Pendrake had maybe ; I slice each ; a mountain of potatoes , a swamp of greens , and boiled turnips and black-eye peas and steamed carrots , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if there was any pie left over from lunch , he 'd drive that home as well . 1'rt for all that gluttony he was the neatest eater I ever seen . He would n't put a linger on any type of food but bread ; for the rest he used knife and fork as nicely as a woman does her needlework . And when he was through the plate shone as though fresh washed , and such hones as was left rose in a little polished stack in an extra bowl he had Lucy I:1N ' by for that purpose . It was a real show to watch him take a meal , and I gut some pleasure from filling in the time that way , left over after I satisfied my own appetite . Mrs. Pendrakc only picked at her own victual , which was no wonder because she did n't do no work for which she 'd have to eat much . Now I was used to Indian women who stayed busy from dawn until they rolled into their buffalo hides , and before that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sisters complained the day was n't long enough in which she could finish her duties . But Mrs. P. had Lucy to cook and there was another colored girl who come in frequent to clean though did n't live in , and that Lavender , he did all  | gardening and run errands and whatnot outdoors . So here was perfectly healthy white woman , in the prime of life , with not hto do except for the hour or so she spent in helping me with my ins when I come home from school . Now having been reared by savages , I had manners that may not Ve been polished but they was considerate . I certainly did n't step to Airs . Pendrake and say : " It strikes me you are useless around here . " But that 's what I thought , and it was n't no criticism for I ykrd her and helped her when I could . She had this idea of being ptv . la , so to oblige I 'd pretend now and again to need mothering . I i the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other bi , vs my age for studying with the ten-year-olds . I let it go awhile , and you know how that works : they give it to me stronger when they believed I had no defense , and throwed in some stuff about ? dirty Indian . " Finally the whole bunch was waiting one afternoon at the corner of an alley on the route home from school . As I come along , they gun to taunt me for being an Indian , which had a unjust side you fight not get until you realize they thought I had been captured and kept prisoner for five year . You might say I deserved their needling more than they knew , but I do n't think they should be forgive on the basis of accident . I kept on walking without comment until one of them stepped out before me . He was about five foot ten at sixteen years of age , and had a few pimples . " ' I:here ai n't a day , " he says , " when I ca n't lick a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it come to fisticuffs , which the Cheyenne did n't practice . Indian boys wrestle some , but as I have Indicated to a sufficiency , they do n't have much reason to fight among their friends when the enemy is generally just beyond the next buffalo wallow . And when they tangle with the enemy , it is not to show him up or make him eat dust , but rather to kill him altogether and rip off the top of his head . I lius I just looked at this boy in contempt and pushed by him , and he hit me with his loutish fist underneath my right ear . I must have staggered off to the bias for eight or ten feet , being his hand Was large and on the end of a weighty arm , and dropped my books /long the way . Them other lads hooted , cawed , and whistled . I had n't had any action now since the saber charge and was n't used to It in town like that , a person tending to go by the custom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto my knees slow , thinking , and that fellow run over and ' swung his boot in the direction of my hind quarters . That puts a man off balance : he should have knowed it if he was going around kicking people , but he learned it then . I just rolled under the lifted foot and pulled the other leg loose . He fell like a bag of sugar . I stuck my hoof into his neck and got the scalping knife from under my shirt ... . No , 1 did n't even scratch him with it . For that matter , I could have let him suffocate had I not lifted my foot off his neck eventu ally , for it choked his wind and he was turning purple . But I was n't no Indian , and figured I had proved it by putting my knife away , gathering up my hooks , and going on . When I got home the angle of my jaw there below the ear was swoll as if I was squirreling a cheekful of nuts . Mrs. Pendrake saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack , I must get you to the dentist . " 1 says no , it was n't no wisdom tooth . We was in the parlor then , where we always did the tutoring although it was far from the best place in the house for that purpose because you could hear the Reverend stuttering in his study nearby , but I guess she supposed I liked it . Then what could it ever be , she asks . She was wearing a rich blue that dat , which become her a great deal , especially when her eyes in sadness took on the exact shade of the dress . Late in the year the buffalo grass turns tawny and when you are climbing an elevation with the sun slanting on it , that 's about the shade of her hair . We was sitting as usual side by side on that plush loveseat , with me as far away as I could get , on account of next to that fine lady I always worried that I still stunk though while I was with the Pendrakes 1 took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A fight , " says I. " A boy hit me there . " She formed an 0 with her mouth , which stayed half open so you could sec just an ivory trace beyond her pink lip , and she put her cool hand on the hack of mine . She was trying to be a mother , see , but did n't really know how . For fighting , a Ma will swat at you if you ai n't hurt , or doctor you if you are . But Mrs. P. figured the thing was to be sad , for she had an ideal conception of everything . Here 's what I mean when I said I helped her : I let my eyes fall to the swell of her bosom , and I lifted her hand to my jaw . " How it thumps , " she says . " Poor Jack . " And you know how  | cm things go , I could n't tell if it was mostly her or me , hut soon I iI my face against her breasts and my thumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are thinking what a nasty little fellow I was . Well , licve what you like , but remember Mrs. Pendrake was only about years older than me . It was hard to think of her as a Ma , but at c same time I never before that moment figured her as a girl if u know what I mean . When it came to idealism , I had quite a bit my own . I have told you the Cheyenne was prigs , and that Itting takes the same kind of energy as sex . It 's peace that is the ) rnv time . Most of them fat merchants in that town was real sex fiords compared to an Indian brave . And them other white boys my age was already slipping into brothels or laying the maids . Vith the inactivity I was undergoing and all , and especially that studying  --  I do n't know much about scholars but I should judge theist a carnal lot , because in my experience with the life of the , wind , though I was interested in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the invisible nature of that which was studied . You ca n't see it nor put your hands on it , yet it claims your absolute attention . It 'd make me nervous in time . Then I would think of girls as a relief . " There you have the background to this incident , before which I never had an indecent thought towards Mrs. Pendrake . And you can get off the hook now , for nothing else happened here . She was a fine lady : if I had n't knowed that otherwise , I could feel it in the hardness of her bosom , which if anything hurt my sore jaw . She was all laced up in whalebone . If Buffalo Wallow Woman pulled you against herself , it had been like sinking into a pillow . For another , at that moment a little delegation showed up at the house : that boy I had fought , his Pa , and a town constable , ready to hang me , I expect , for assault with a deadly weapon . Though Mrs. P. as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of situation she could n't be bettered . In polite relations , as you might call them , she was the Queen of England . First place , she kept them people in the hall while me and her continued to sit upon the loveseat . I do n't mean she said Stay out there ; she just had that force of will . So the constable , a beefy Individual , filled the whole doorway and if the boy 's Pa wanted to LW something , had to step aside . They was always bumping into one another . We never saw the boy at all .  | " Missus , " the constable says , " if it be discommoding to you , why they ai n't no reason why we cai n't come back another time . " I I waited for a bit , but Mrs. Pendrake never answered such common tary . " Well then , I got a lad here , Lucas English , son of Horace English what owns the feed store ? " " Is that Mr. English behind you , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constable and English , a fellow in vest and sleeve-garter : , do that little dance of interchange and Travis drops his helmet , and English says : " Yes 'm , and there ai n't nothing personally involved in this matter , Mrs. Reverend , for I been obliged to the Reverend for many years for supplying his wants in the way of feed ? " Mrs. Pendrake says there with her cold smile : " I believe you refer to the wants of the Reverend Pendrake 's animal , do you not , Mr. English , and arc not suggesting that Mr. Pendrake eats oats . " English gasps with false laughter , which gets his hoof further down his throat , and the constable pushes him away and steps into the doorf rune . " It 's like this , Mrs. , " says he . " There seems to be a fight between two lads . One lad 's got him a knife , and according to the statemenm of the first , says he will get him the other 's scalp with it like the redskin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't within the law . " Mrs. I'cndrake says : " The poet tells us to err is human , Mr. Travis . 1 ' 111 sure the English boy did not intend to use his knife on my dear Jack , but simply to make a childish threat . If Jack can forgive hint , I shall not prefer charges . " She looks at me and asks : " Dear ? " " Sure , " I says , feeling real queer to hear her call me that for the first time . " All then , , 1lr . Travis , " Mrs. P. says . " So far as I am concerned , there 's an end to it . " And thanked him , and called for Lucy to let them out . Now I figured after that handsome performance I owed Mrs Pendrake something . Oh , I suppose even at the time I knew she had never done it for me , though it was obvious to a clever woman like her that I had the knife . She just was n't going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fact I belonged to her gave me absolute immunity , the way she saw it . I had never before known a woman . white or red , who had that type of opinion of herself , which was power though you might say used negatively . Had it been used in the positive fashion , she 'd have been manly , but nobody could ever  | take Mrs. Pendrake for anything but z io per cent female though you Wright not confuse her with your Ma . But right now , I thought I could please her by pretending , anyWay , to make that very confusion . It might have been play-acting on her part to call me " dear , " but I 'll tell you I liked it in front of the ) se slobs . So I says : " Mother " ? " Mother " is what I says ? " Mother , which a t he poet what wrote that particular motto ? " Well sir , the word did a lot for her , though I might not have pronounced it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't let on , but went to a bookcase and brought back a volume . " Mr. Alexander Pope , " she says , " who also wrote : Fools rush in where angels fear to tread . ' " She read me some of that man 's verse , which sounded like the trotting of a horse if you never paid attention to the words or did n't understand most of them like me . What I did savvy seemed right opinionated , like that fellow had the last word on everything . My only complaint was that for a poet he was n't any too romantic . Now you take a boy who lived my kind of life , you 'd figure him to be about as realistic as any , if not altogether cynical . That may be so , but it never applied to women , or at least not to beautiful 4 white women who was useless for practical purposes . I fell into an infatuation for Mrs. Pendrake right then . I guess even at my present time of life , I am still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Authority is also involved , as in her handling that constable and feed merchant , and having a knowledge of fine aspects , like the way she held the works of Mr. Pope , with her head inclined against the afternoon sun from the west window so that the margins of her nose and forehead was crystalline and her hair old gold . She always knowed the right thing so far as civilization went , like an Indian knows it for savagery . And I saw then that uselessness was a necessary part of it . If you put such a woman to work , you 'd lose that which was her special value , like if you made u hitching post of a statue . I figured to have got the idea of white life , right then . It had n't ought to do with the steam engine or arithmetic or even Mr. Pope 's verse . Its aim was to turn out a Mrs. Pendrake . I said infatuation , but you can call it love , and directly I was awed by it and moved over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while I was sliding my butt across the plush , in  | comes the Reverend from the door behind us which connected wit ' his study . He had stopped rumbling there when the men had showed up . Now he moves ponderously around in front of us , anal for some moments his wife kept reading whatever poem she was on then , so he waited till she was done . Then he spoke to me . " Boy , " he said , real kindly . " Boy , it is my opinion that you hay labored earnestly at your studies in these three months since comin ! ' to this house . " The next thing he done was to falter and stroke hi ! , beard . The wonders of this day was never-ceasing . After that firs ' afternoon , he had no more spoke to me than to Mrs. Pendrake in nt hearing . " I do not want you to have the misapprehension , " he finally said . " that we here see life as all duty . Therefore tomorrow , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and if you arc favorably disposed to the project , I should be willing to take you fishing . " Now , it being November of the year and while not winter as yet the weather was cold and damp and not the time any sane person would have fished for sport , I lost no time in accepting the invite . Add to the other reasons against so doing that I really could n't stand the Reverend except when he was eating , and you wo n't understand why I did until I say that if he seemed to be in his wife 's debt , I had just now got to feeling in his . So there we was , out to the creek next day in fairly miserable weather where the air was like a big sponge full of water and no sooner had we reached the stream when someone squeezed it and rain begun to pour down . We had come out in a buckboard , with Lavender driving and only he had sense enough to bring protection against the inclemency , for he had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could see right off that the Reverend did n't know anything , about fishing from the way he put a doughball on the hook  --  that was what we used , for I , avendcr claimed he could n't find worms in late November . And the day was sufficiently unpleasant to drive oil a fellow who was crazy for the sport . But Pendrake had said he was going fishing , and that 's what he fixed to do , the water swirling around his hatbrim and running off his black coat . He was dressed in his usual , by the way , with no provision for leisure . Lavender offered us his umbrella in insincere fashion , for which  | nt blame him , but Pendrake said no , he did n't require it , so vender kept it over himself and put a blanket underneath a tree I tick there and looked at an illustrated paper someone had give n t hough he could n't read , but seemed to get more out of it than us Who could , for he was laughing at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ways along by nc willows which was now brown and he says : " What 's your inion of this location , boy ? " " It 's as good as any , " says I. My hair was all matted from the rain ct water coursed down my cheeks ; it seemed ridiculous in view of tat we was supposed to be doing to have a good time , but I never nded the soaking as such , having been wetted down plenty as an di:ui inside as well as outside the lodge , for tepee skins generally k after they been in use for a while , especially at the seams . But here he looked at me out of that black beard and said with Hume feeling , for which his voice was less ponderous : " Ah , boy , ou'rc getting wet . " With that he drew a big handkerchief and Lied my face right gently . I guess I ca n't explain it , but that was one of the truly kindest ings anybody 's done for me , ever . It did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sudden discovery of the rain after it Cpoured some minutes might have been foolish . He put his big hand on my damp shoulder and looked sorry out of all proportion . I had n't seen him straight ever before . His eyes was hazel and did n't have too much of a lid . Without the beard he would have looked to lose much of his force , though he surely had enormous strength of muscle . " We do n't have to stay if you do n't want to , " he said . " We can go on back . It was an unfortunate idea . " He shook his head like a buffalo bull and droplets flung off the beard and he turned away and stared at the muddy creek , and says : " He sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust . " " Who ? " asks I , for I did n't know . " Why , our Heavenly Father , boy , " says Pendrake and , closing up grim again , throws his line in the water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bobber was dancing all the time and you would never tell from it if you caught a whale . The Indians has always fished with a spear , which is to me a more interesting endeavor than hook and line . Also the rain was now  | getting to me : I had softened up in only a month or so . However , I did n't want to hurt the Reverend 's feelings , so I presented him a bright suggestion . Acting on it , he had Lavender run the wagon down on the bank , which was wide enough and flat for such accommodation , unhitch the horse and take him back under the tree , and we crawled beneath the buckboard , letting our ftshpoles stick out , and thus had a roof against the elements . Any fool could have figured this out , but the Reverend was greatly impressed by what he called my " acumen . " He seemed relieved that I was no longer getting soaked . As to himself , it was more complicated : you see , his trouble was he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would have preferred to be dripping and uncomfortable  --  that 's the only reason I could dream up as to why we come in the open wagon at all rather than the closed buggy which he also owned . I never could study out why Lavender was there , except that maybe the Reverend was uneasy with Inc by himself . It seas a tight squeeze for a man of his bulk underneath the buckboard. 1Ve set there a time smelling of wet wool , during which the current intermingled our lines and swept them useless into the bank and no d()Iiht soon melted off the doughballs . At length Pendrake said : " Boy , from what you asked before about t he rain , I understand my delinquency . " He was cramped in there with his beard against his rising belly and looking on to the stream through the sheet of water coming from above . " I have left you to live in the ignorance of an animal , though I have been specifically charged with leading men to a knowledge of God . Vestcrdav , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention that you are swiftly approaching the province of adulthood , that soon the boy will be the man . " For a minute I was scared he seen me on his wife 's bosom and misinterpreted that event . " Mrs. Pendrake , " he began , and I gathered my legs under me in case I had to run for it , " Mrs. Pendrake , being a woman , is altogether innocent of these matters . She was not a party to a lie . Looking at you through the eyes of a mother , she saw no blemish in the boy she knows , and that is a credit to her . " But I am a man , and as such , no stranger to impurity . I myself passed through the years in which you find yourself . I know the  | Ik il , boy , I have shaken him by the hand , I have embraced him and Welled his stinking breath and thought it the finest perfume . " E le got himself exercised with these remarks and pressed his head ainst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ague lifted several inches out of the mud . ' I lien he eased and spoke gentle . " I heard that colloquy through Ivy study door . I am aware that you had the knife , boy , and I can imagine only too well your motive for using it against another . ? .. The girl 's identity is of no interest to me . I am willing to licve that although you were doing the Devil 's work you did not recognize him in his female attire . Does she have velvet cheeks , boy , and satin hair and long-lashed eyes undershot with damask ? No Matter , behind that mask is a skull of white bone with hollow sockets , and that soft pink mouth is the cave of death . " I just flicked my line as if I had a bite , for whatever could I say to that ? As to the girls I had been thrown with so far , they was ten years old in that school class . " I do n't condemn you , boy , " Pendrake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rises in the loins and sweeps upward consuming all hcf ore it . I know the primitive peoples among whom you spent your boyhood make a sacred thing of this conflagration . But that is our difference , is it not ? that we harness our bestial energies . That we do not defile but preserve . Woman is a vessel , and it is within man 's power to make that vessel a golden chalice or a slop bucket . " Along about here , Lavender come down to the bank under his umbrella and toting an enormous basket covered with oilcloth . He rcrooched down and peeked at us under the wagon . When talking to the Reverend he assumed a lazy , whiny , idiotic style that I happened to know he reserved for just that purpose , for he was otherwise very sharp though illiterate as I said . " Your Honor , " says he , " would . . . you all . . , be wantin ' ... thisheer lunch ? " " Put it down , that 's a good fellow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figured would stimulate Lavender to move faster but seemed to have the reverse effect . When Lavender finally trudged away , Pendrake said : " There is a case in point . Can you understand that Lavender and Lucy would have lived in common , defying the ordinances of God and man , had I not insisted on marrying them ? " I might say at this point and then we wo n't mention it again , that  | I do not know whether Pendrake was Abolitionist or Proslavery . He had freed Lavender , if that meant anything . And if he was Abolitionist , why his reason would have been that freedom would make the colored people less lusty . Now I know you can read in history books that the slavery issue was hot in Missouri of this date , and there was private wars over it and shootings in the dead of night , a reign of terror and so on . Well that ai n't no lie , but you could be living right in the middle of it like me and never know it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 1 knowed many a man who went all the way across the prairies during the Indian wars and never saw one hostile savage . That 's the way relit v operates . I was n't ever interested in politics , so I never saw any . In them days there was always somebody getting shot or knifed , and you would n't think nothing of it . And then I have an idea that I'cndrakc was so respectable that he might not have had to take a loudnunut lied stand either way . I'he Reverend broke off at that point and pulled the oilcloth from the gasket . Lucy had packed us more food than all of Old Lodge Skins 's hand ate ( luring one whole winter . There was two or three cold fried chickens , a great hunk of ham , about a dozen hardboiled eggs , two loaves of bread , and a chocolate cake , just to mention the larger items . We lr:ul n't done nothing so far but sit under the wagon , and I was n't too hungry . I was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the Cheyenne you wear leather , which takes the rain almost like your own skin . Or maybe I might have been embarrassed at Pendrake 's jawing about matters that should be private . I guess I already knowed it at ten , before I went with the Indians , but I had forgot how the conjunction of men and women is looked upon as dirty by the whites , so they got to involve it with law . Lucy and Lavender shared the same room , but it was against the laws of God and man until Pendrake said a few words over them , after which it was O.K. Well , it was an entertainment to see the Reverend consume that lunch . I ate a wing , an egg , and a piece each of bread and cake and felt myself uncomfortable full at that . All the rest went soon enough into Pendrake 's great belly . What was left of the contents of the basket was a pile of cleaned bones and eggshells within fifteen minutes .  | ' 1 hen he brushed his beard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him saw him drop a crumb into that underbrush he was neat about food , I believed , because he was n't going to let morsel escape his mouth  --  and picked his teeth and cleared his ages with a huge draught from a jug of water that Lucy had ' ludcd . " It has been a great satisfaction to me to have this talk with you , bo , " he says then . " And I hope and trust you will derive some lue from it . We have not before had the opportunity to know ch other , for while I am your father upon earth , I am much copied with serving my own Father in heaven . But He is also ours , and in serving him I am serving you , if I do it properly . That ( Tort leaves me little time for the delightful sport we are enjoying day , though to enjoy oneself moderately is surely no sin . " I have n't mentioned how I had to sit Sundays in church and listen to Pendrake 's gab . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well , wearing her fine clothes , and it was a proud thing to sit alongside the most beautiful woman in town , with the men , including the ancient elders , stealing looks at her and their women all rpeevish . But them sermons ! Pendrake 's trouble was he did n't have no ; fire . Unlike my old man , he did n't get no release from his religion , but rather was further bottled up by it . That might have kept him from getting killed by savages , but maybe it is worse never to open your spirit up to the wind . Anyway , he always said a good deal about " sin , " and what I got to wondering now we was sitting there , was what in his opinion constituted such . You may remember with my Pa it was cussing , chewing , spitting , and not washing your face . It seemed likely Pendrake had another view . Anyway , we obviously was n't going to catch any fish , and lunch was over , and despite the Reverend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was still uneasy-looking . I reckon a man who puts out words all the time gets to wondering whether they are ever being received . So to oblige him , with the same motive I had called Mrs. P. " Mother , " I asked about sin . He was n't a bad fellow , and he had wiped off my face . I am like an Indian in that if I am treated nice I 'll try to make a return . He had a wider-sweeping definition of sin than my Pa 's , and a longer list of specifics than my old man had give , probably because  | Pa was an amateur at preaching and could n't read . For Pendrake ' " , roster was n't properly his own but rather , as he admitted , that ol the Biblical Paul . " The works of the flesh , " answers the Reverend . " And the work ' , of the flesh are manifest , which are these : adultery , fornication , uncleanness , lasciviousness , idolatry , witchcraft , hatred , variance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , envyings , murders , drunkenness , revclings , and such like . ' " It was a funny thing , the most important years of my rearing so far had been handled by my second father , who was Old Lodge Skins . Now you take away " envyings " from that list  --  for he did n't covet much , owing to his belief he had everything of importance already  --  - and you had a perfect description of that Indian 's charac ter . Yet he was as big a success among the Cheyenne as a man could be . As to nivsclf , I had performed only a few of them crimes ; on the other hand , I was still young . For the rest of the day , though , I stayed fairly pure and even extended the period for several weeks on . That 's what white life did to me . ' , First time I got soaked in civilization , I come down with pneumnia. )  | I WAS REAL SICK , such as I had not been since earliest childhood . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sick . I mean , I do n't like to get a wound , but if you have to pay a penalty I 'd rather it were that than any type of illness which will put you to bed . I do n't care to lay around unless some part of my flesh is missing and I can watch it knitting up . You see there what I said about penalty . Despite my cynical ways it I approached the age of sixteen , the Reverend had got to me with his bluenose talk , and I had had dreams the night after the fishing expedition , in which I was doing my damnedest , though I knowed it .110as wrong , to make the golden chalice of woman into a slop bucket like he said . You might say he give me the idea , just as he give me pneumonia by that outing in the rain , for that 's what I had in the morning though at first it seemed like just a cold and I got up as usual . But I felt so poorly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mess of eggs though he was neat as always , so Mrs. P. puts her cool hand against my forehead , which was flushed at the same time that I was chilled to the bone . Shortly I was back in bed , and an old doc with white whiskers come eventually but he did n't have the medicine of Left-Handed Wolf , I can tell you . I was sick for about three weeks , and underst ood later that it was believed I should die during the first few days and the Reverend come and prayed over me . Lavender told me that . He dropped in frequent when I started to improve . I remember the first time I saw him standing alongside the bed as I woke up from the napping with which I put in most of that time , I had the delusion I was back among the Cheyenne . He was  | very black of countenance , but the Indians sometimes painted them selves that color : anyhow , he was n't white . So I made a remark in Cheyenne . " Pardon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I seen who he was and felt embarrassed . " Now then , " he says , " you just rest easy . Do n't you worry none about old Lavender . I lc just come to see how you was . " He generally referred to himself in that style , as if he was talkinl about a third person . I guess he had some theory that you would n't suffer him to sav " I " or " inc. , " I says : " I thought you was an Indian . " Sometimes one remark will make you a friend , and it generally ai n't planned to do so , for I have found that you can seldom intentionally make up a successful compliment . I do n't mean I was enemies with Lavender before saying that ; it was rather that we took each other for granted as kid and servant . I reckon he had come to visit me out of curiosity . I le says : " 1 snuck up here while everbody but Lucy 's not to home , and I.ucy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I hail a room all my own on the second floor , with a big soft bed that took me a while to get onto sleeping in without taking down seasick . " Ai n't you never been here before ? " " I carried up furniture , " Lavender says , " and washed the windows , but never come for socializing . I suppose if it be known I was here now , you might say you ast me . " " Sure , " I told him , and then you know how a person will feel selfpity when he 's sick : " I reckon you 're the only one who cares whether I live or die . You 're the only one who come . " " You just do n't recall , " he says . " The Lady was here all the time , and the Reverend made his prayers and I reckon had he not you 'd be stone-cold and they 'd have dug a hole in the ground and drapped you in and shoveled the earth hack on and stomped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " so long as it did n't happen I wish you would n't go on about it in such detail . l ) o you figure it was God who saved me when asked by the Reverend ? " Lavender gets a sly look . " That doctor ai n't likely to have done it when he run Lucy off from giving you any of her tonic what is made from roots and suchlike and will cure any ailment . I tell you ,  | was a time when everything I et turned to poison and my ach felt like a fishnet . Lucy give me her tonic and inside a week could chew up and swally a bone like a dog and never tell the 6Tcrcncc from a bowl of mush. " said : " Why do n't you set upon the chair there ? " " I would n't mind it a-tall , " says he and does as much , a little stiff w first and then gradually taking his ease . " Say now , that was a funny thing , you taking me for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just realized I had a mustard plaster on my chest , because it started to itch , and so I was scratching while we talked . I says : " I saw a Cheyenne dark as you down on the Solomon 's Fork . They called him Mohkstavihi , which is the same name they rive to any colored person like yourself . " J- " Black Man ? " " No , Black White Man . " he laughed out loud at that , then stopped short and nodded serious . " I got to burn leaves now , " he says and goes out . I wonder if I had hurt his feelings , but it was the truth , which is supposed to make you free . 1 lowever , back he come the following day , when Mrs. Pendrake had gone out shopping again and the Reverend was in his study , and this time Lavender never feared Lucy on account of he got bold enough to ask Pendrake 's permission to see me , which was granted . 1 le also took the chair without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owing to my upbringing I never had no views on how fresh you should let a darky get , though that was a worrisome thing to plenty of whites in Missouri . It turned out that Lavender was fascinated by Indians . I have said Mrs. P. listened that first day to my experiences , but that was the end of it , so I suppose she did then just to be mannerly . And anybody else I run into would have rather died than asked me about tliat subject , I reckon . But Lavender could n't get enough of it . I would have thought he was going to write a book had he not been illiterate . After a time he says : " That dark Indian you told me about seeing on the Solomon River , I been thinking on him , and I figure he might he kin . " Lavender was a smart fellow ; he could n't read nor write and never had a day of schooling , but he knowed a great deal of  | things . He started talking now about Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got around to in the school , for their names was new to me . " Why , " he says , " them white men went up the river until it got so skinny they could stand with one foot on the right bank and one on the left , and then found the tiny hole it trickled out of , and could have stuck a finger in it and stopped it off , and you would n't have had no more Missouri River but just a big ditch of mud two thousand mules long , ( Irvin ' and crackin ' in the sun . " I did n't believe him , but later I heard it was true  --  I mean about Lewis and ( : lark being real people ; whether they could have stopped off the Missouri with one finger was another thing . " Captain Lewis and Captain Clark took along a colored man named York , and the Indians had never seen a colored man before and thought York was painted black , so would spit on their hands and try to rub York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd tell all the other redskins for miles around and they would all come and try to rub the paint off him too . " York was the most interesting thing the Indians found about Captain I.ewis and Captain Clark . And you know what he done , for he was right humorous , he told them Indians he had started life as a wild animal and Captain Clark caught him in a snare and tamed him into a than . " Then he roared and showed his teeth and the Indians would run away . But they took a great liking to York , give him presents and had him lay with their women so as to get some black babies . " Lavender raised his eyebrows . He said : " Now it is likely if you was to go out there today you would run into some of his offspring , which it looks to me like you done . York was a first cousin to my granddaddy . I believe he was the most famous person in my fanmily . " It could be , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surer I am , " Lavender says , and then he leans over close to mac , keeping his voice down : " I do n't mind telling you I 'm fixing to go out there myself . . . . Now you go and mention that to I . ucy and 1 ' 11 be in trouble . " " You ai n't taking her along ? " " That 's my reason for leaving , " he whispers , while looking fearfully towards the doorway . " You let a woman catch you and you 'll have reason to be sorry for it every minute of the day . Now the  | wrrend bought me from my old master and he freed me accordto law . I have heerd him say : ' No man must own another . ' Then makes me marry Lucy , for I expect he believe it 's all right for a nt , tn to own a man . The way I look at it , I had one benefit from and one defect , so I am even now and before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't have any laws a-tall and are purely ugc . " , I:tyhc we should go together , " I said . Until that minute I never Awl thought of running away from the Pendrakes , for they had treated Inc well , but I had been in civilization for a couple of /p-ntIts now and still could n't see no sense to it whenever Mrs. P. rant around . Now I was sick in this shameful way : you had n't ght to be made ill by the rain , which is a natural thing . What it ant was that I was n't living right . About the only time I felt per in town is when I throwed that kid Luke English to the round and went for my knife . And I believed my blood was getng watery from the lack of raw buffalo liver . The only thing I riled so far that seemed to take real root was lustful yearnings , d t he Reverend told me they was wrong . " II* you can wait till I am better ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't going to listen to that Ile . The difference between me and you is I am colored and you is boy . Now nobody has no call to stop a colored man who ai n't a Slave from running off , but if he takes a boy with him , he got Drullb ! c with the law again . " " Listen , " says I , " once we get beyond Fort Leavenworth , I 'll be taking you . " That hurt his pride and he mumbled some with his eyes down , ottd he allows : " Well , I 'm going tonight , anyway . I would wait if I @mild , but I cai n't . " " Vhat difference would another few days make ? " For I thought to he up within that time . " Fiver hour is a living agony , " says Lavender . " It is a monstrosity of nature for man to be ruled by woman . " I figured he got them words from something Pendrake said , so I Baked if Lucy give him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it from the Reverend ? " Look here , " Lavender tells me , " I ai n't going to say nothing against your Daddy . " " I le is my Pa , " says I , " only in that law you was talking about ,  | and it is a wondrous thing how a man can get himself new relative . by signing a piece of paper . " It made a real mark on Lavender that I never held a high opinion of law , either , and like himself was a victim of it , though not in his discomfort . He sort of shrugs with his mouth and says in a low voice : " 1 lc ai n't going to get none in the usual way . " My hack started to ache from a twitch of muscle , and I shifted my position in bed . " What 's that supposed to mean ? " But I knowed well enough , and my back felt worse at the new angle . Lavender winced and drew back . " I do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you was going to run off tonight . " 1 le opened his eyes . " That 's right , " he says and grins in relief . " That 's right , I sure am . " " You reach Inc over that paper and pencil on the desk , I 'll draw you a neap of where to find the Cheyenne . " I told him quite a number of useful items on how to get along with the Indians , concluding with : " Now you can be friendly but do n't ever crawl on your belly before a Cheyenne no matter what he does , on account of he 'll do it worse then . I mention that because they have lately had a lot of trouble with whites and might carry a prejudice . " " Against white men ? " " Of which you are a black-colored one , " I says . " I 'm talking of what they believe , which is the truth when you live among them , like law is around here .

" If you was going to wait a while , I 'd teach you some of the sign talk and maybe Cheyenne as well , " I said . " No , " he told me , " I cai n't tarry . But I thank you kindly . " " Hold on , " I says as he starts to rise from the chair . " You never finished what you begun before about the Reverend . " Lavender went out and looked up and down the hall , then he come back alongside my bed . " He do n't lay with his Lady , " says he . " I expect on account of he is a preacher , but them other preachers in town has children , so it must not be against the law . " " You mean never ? " I asks . " For I 've knowed Indians who  | d n't do it for a time because of a dream they had or before a TUcvcr , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an egg . She the gift of a witch . That 's the reason I 'm leaving .

He come in to see me again r , rt day and never even apologized for not carrying out his n Instead he talked as if he meant the next night , and the same lured the next , and so on . People who talk instead of do give me pain in the arse . I reckon Lavender just wanted somebody to trl ) I ; iin to , and that 's all right , but I wish he would of admitted it . the other hand , I guess you ought to have a different standard judging a man who had been kept as slave until the age of tit v-two . It takes him a while to know what 's possible , and be he should be given credit for just having the idea of real cdom . Any ways , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the only m in that town I could talk to with ease . That boy I whipped , ice English , come around to visit while I was sick . He still hated y guts and figured he had been tricked rather than beaten outright whites always believed that when licked by Indians  --  but his Pa Hied to suck up to the Pendrakes , so sent him over with a cake his a had made . Luke stopped somewhere on the way and tongued off Il the icing ; which did n't matter none to me , though , because I was Rill off my feed and could n't have ate a cannonball like that when live l 1 . As soon as Mrs. Pendrake , who had let him in , went downstairs , kc started talking indecent . Him and the Reverend could have one around with a tent show , holding debates on the topic , for they represented the long and short of it . Lukeremarked , studying round my room with his mean es , " you got quite a wigwam here . Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) id you ? " I asked him in scorn . " I do n't have it so private . I got to bunk in with three brothers . tSay , y old man and old lady went at it so hard they have filled the use . I also got four sisters . The oldest is just eighteen . Some feller mbs in her bed every night and has his way with her . Pa do n't know what to do about it . "  | I was taken in and dumb enough to ask : " Why do n't he shoo ' him ? " " Oh , " says Luke , cackling , " it 's her husband . " He sits down on the foot of my bed . " What 's it like with an Indin squaw ? I hear they got quite a strong smell . I hear you want one , you throw a bean across the fire and the one it lands near has t go with you even if she 's married to the chief . I never had an India woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd druther find no a fat sheep if I could n't get nothing else . " Course I do all right as it is . The other day I come into the roost while the darkv girl was cleaning . Nobody else was upstairs at the time , though my Ma and sisters was down in the kitchen . So I wa ? , feeling like a piece , and I just throwed that black girl down and put it to her .... I never did like dirty tales , true or false ; if they 're any good , the just stake you wistful ; if not , there 's nothing more boresome in the world , I reckon . As to Luke , the more he talked , the more I was convinced that his experience consisted solely of playing with hint self to the point of idiocy . Nonetheless when Mrs. Pendrake come up and asked us both it we 'd like a glass of buttermilk and I says no and showed I was tired , and he says yes and she took him off to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as her head was turned , I was pretty jealous . For you take even a rotten-looking kid like that , he was of the stale sex , and Mrs. P. knowed it . She could n't hell ) reminding you she was a woman . I do n't mean she did one thing you could see with the naked eye , and as I have said she was down  - -  right cool to most men and acted as if they was standing in horse manure about ten feet below her location . After enough time for him to have drunk a gallon , Luke come back upstairs , where lie had forgot his cap . He was licking his thick lips , which I guess was reasonable enough on account of there was a margin of buttermilk around them . But I had my knife under the pillow , and I remember vowing that if he made one reference tto Mrs. Pendrake , I would cut out his black heart . But he just said : " Well , I 'll tell my Pa you ai n't going to die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got no hard feelings if you ai n't . When you get back on your feet I 'll innerduce you to a good whore down at Mrs. Lizzie 's . " I had been a man before my time , and now I was being a babe  | r it , just laid there day after day and when I was n't being talked looked at the ceiling and saw a naked woman imprinted on it . W Mrs. P. , I hasten to say  --  nor the Indian females I had seen now again without clothes though the Cheyenne is modest , and you c Nothing , had I come upon her bare it would n't have been a king experience  --  but rather a picture of a nude woman that used h.tng back of the bar in the saloon in Evansville years before n my Pa preached there . Vow that is a funny thing that come back to me from a time n it did n't mean nothing . They put a blanket over it during ices , and I can recall Bill sniggering and my sisters blushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fat as to breast and hip , and had pe meaty haunch crossed over the other so as to hide her loins . Her 1-Ics was purple , that was all I could have said at the age I had n t hen , because they reminded me of plums . But here she was on the ceiling of my bedroom . It went along th everything else in that house , I suppose , the image and not the fits , : Mrs. Pendrake 's motherhood , the Reverend 's spiritual auMnrity , Lavender 's freedom , and my woman who had never existed . At last I got strong enough to take outside walks so long as I ssed warmly , for it was winter now with a fall or two of snow lhile I had been laid up . And then one afternoon when we had ished our dinner , the Reverend having so far as I was concerned IUtdonc even his own record in laying waste a turkey singlehanded for Mrs. P. took very little and I was still on soup  --  Mrs. Pendrake Ivs : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk downtown with Ar . We might take a glass of soda water and buy some new lot lies . " I wo n't go into the shopping , which Mrs. P. accomplished in amazIngly short time for a woman though she bought a big load of stuff or both herself and me . I reckon she was about clothes like the ever-end was concerning food : gluttonous but tidy . Nevertheless , I s n't any too robust yet and even when well I get dizzy in shops . she noticed that and says : " Now we 'll have our soda water . " I had never been in the place we went , which had just been riled up while I was sick , pretty fancy with little marble tables d wire chairs and some brasswork , and there was a big marble bar d on it a vessel like a funeral urn which was silver-plated , with a pid sitting on top and two elephants ' heads projecting from the - wl . In the base of this structure was six or seven knobs under  | which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then stick it beneath an elephant 's trunk , turn his ear , and out would come the soda water . I took an immediate dislike to the fellow who run the place , for he thought quite a lot of himself , wore a brocade waistcoat and it artificial flower in his lapel , and was mighty tall . I guess you 'd say he was handsome by the light of some , clean-shaven and with blacl , curly hair . I lc sure thought so , anyhow . What I did n't like was the snooty manner in which he run a place where women and children went for refreshment . Now this fellow would draw the soda himself , then put the glassc ? , on a silvered tray which a small colored boy who was dressed like a little Arab , turban and balloon pants , would tote to your table . I tipped the kid a penny the Reverend give me , and he was n't in the least grateful for it , just bit it to see if it was genuine , and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that because I wanted to play the grown titan at this point and escort Mrs. P. rather than vice versa , for I was almost sixteen . I was shorter than her while walking , but seated here we was about the same size . She got the idea , for Mrs. Pendrake knew every minute the exact situation when it come to male and female , and without caddis attention to it she slipped me a dollar so I could pay the bill when time came . It was perfect for about two minutes , me and her together like that , and she called me " dear " a good deal and the cherry-flavored soda that she drunk left a flush on her underlip . I had never seen anything more lovely than her fair face between the fur hat and collar . She and 1 , we just cared for each other and hated everybod else in the soda shop and maybe the rest of the world thrown in . Then over conics that bastardly proprietor sneering with his front teeth , though he means it as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maybe Buster would like to eat a cake . " He did n't talk cultivated like her or ignorant like mc , just cheap . He was also the first man I had ever saw who did n't give way before Mrs. Pendrake , but looked at her insolent with his eyelids falling . In return she faltered towards him , then said to me : " This is Mr. Kane , Jack . " I knowed by then what was manners and stood up so as not to shame her , but he did n't put out his hand nor acknowledge the introduction in any other wise , but went back to the marble counter  | Axed a tray of cookies and sweetmeats and had them delivered me by means of the little colored boy . ' t that kind , " said Mrs. Pendrake . She picked her muff from spare chair . " I wonder , dear , whether while you are occupied these , you might permit me to finish my shopping . I must several more purchases and should not forgive myself for you on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure for me to hear her speak , I somefailed to gather the sense of it . So it was now . I did n't realize was leaving me there until she touched my shoulder and went to door , having to open it for herself , for that manager kept his k turned then , though a minute later when two ugly , scrawny les who I recognized as the wife of an elder of our church and old-maid sister prepared to go , he sprang out and in his oily km bowed them on to the walk . ell , I thought , if he thinks he 's going to get the better part of dollar with them cakes , he is wrong . I was n't hungry , anyway , I grew a little resentful that Mrs. Pendrake had n't recalled the ' tor saying I should go easy on sweets . Feeling sulky , I gazed up the ceiling of that place and saw my old tormentor , the woman of saloon picture , printed on it . It must have been the thought of Ice English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at rs . Lizzie 's . He no doubt had lied , but I knowed where Mrs. rjic 's was , over a saloon at the other end of town , and there was Ntrc whores there , which you could see hanging in the windows , and sometimes if you was a boy my age they would call down : " I 'll grow you up for a dollar . " It 'd fix Mrs. Pendrake right if I went over there with her dollar . be had n't ought to have left me alone , I was thinking . I got up and Went to the counter to pay my bill , realizing then that I would n't bare a dollar left , for that soda water was a nickel apiece and maybe that skunk would charge for them cakes though I had n't ate a one , and vet I was sort of relieved at not having to go to Mrs. Lizzie 's . I was a real mess at that time of my life , never having an idea but it was canceled by the next . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know where he went , pbsving behind an old fellow with a handlebar mustache who alInved my reckoning was already taken care of . So I still had my dollar , which seemed unfortunate when I reached the street , for a rcat weakness hit me in the hamstrings . I looked up and down for  | Mrs. Pendrake , wishing I could see her so I would n't have to go no further . There was nothing in the world I wanted so little as a whore at that moment , but I felt it was a challenge once I had got up instead of waiting in the soda-water place . Then I saw the tracks of her boots in the slush . I could n't tell you what made them distinguishable from the other footprints ; I just knowed them , for I was familiar with her every particular . I could smell a room and tell you if she had been in it during the last twti days . That 's the one respect in which my senses had n't got blunted while living in town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner , took a left , north another block , again a left  --  I followed them though pretending to be dawdling along like a sappy kid  --  and when they had rook that second left onto a residential street run fling parallel to and behind the block of shops , I understood she hat lied . 1 lalfway along the block was an alley that run back to the cons nrercial street . A cart had been through it but lately , pulled by a mule led by a colored man about seventy years of age : an Indian would have knowcd the age of the mule as well . Anyway , right along this alley had gone Mrs. Pendrake 's little boots , out towards the shops again , except when they come to the back of one of the stores , they turned through a gate , crossed a short yard past the privy , up to a door , and ended . paused at the fence , for here come that colored fellow with his cart again , and sure enough he looked about seventy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking like Lavender of what secrets is seen in eggs and so on , but I believe the reason why the knowcd everything in those days was they was always trucking things through hack alleys , cleaning up bedrooms and the like , and you can pick up a lot of dirt that way without even looking for it . He bid me the time of day and went creaking past , and then a black dog begun to growl on the other side of the alley and then hushed . There was a minute when the alley was empty and quiet , and I took it to go through the gate on Mrs. P. 's trail . O.K. , I reached the door as she had , but what now ? It did n't have no keyhole and anyway probably opened into a dark hall . I put my ear against it and never heard a thing . Suppose I barged in and she was being fitted for a corset ? I felt awful at the thought , but at the same time right excited . You have to recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relic I am today . I am a dirty old man now but in that time I was  | a filthy young boy , and I hope it is not so disgusting to you , you must believe I was never before nor since in that much ry. certainly did n't barge in . Over to the side of the door was a big ) dbox and beyond it a window onto the porch . A person my size d scrooch down next to the one and peer into the other , *rr+ tigb a teeny crack in the shutters closed on it , and nobody using rtc alley were the wiser . For all the things I noticed on the route here , it never struck me t I was at the back of the same building in which the soda-water ? c occupied the front . I saw that , if nothing else , when I stagd on out a couple minutes later and somehow drug myself back me. ' shat I seen through the crack was that proprietor and Mrs. kndrakc . They had their clothes on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , he had bared his big teeth , pulled her high collar down a little , and bit her white neck . I would have broke in and killed him , but for her look of liking it immensely .  | page deleted  | page deleted  | pug nose . She 'd smile at me in class , but when I was there alone w i t h her she 'd turn right shy if I looked her in the eye . I could have kissed her any time I wanted . Reason I did n't was h c Reverend had really got to me with that talk of sin  --  in a sort oI backhanded way , through his wife getting her neck bit by that cal. ( eater . I was finished with golden chalices that might get turned in , slop jars , just as I had stopped seeing that purple-titted paintin ; ' The way I accomplished that was to go right to the slop jars ii , begin with . By the time I turned sixteen , early in February , I was . ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I run to the whores was easy alongside of the nci admission I gut to make regarding my activities that winter , hug there ai n't no avoiding it if you want the whole truth . I become .1 small-sized version of that Kane what run the soda-water place . lint one , I got- to being a conscious dandy . I had earlier felt unea ! , wearing them fancy clothes Mrs. P. had bought me , fur-trimm ( , l and all , but now there was nothing I cherished more than orna , c attire . In them days kids wore jeans and stuff to school , but the way I got myself up you would have thought I was the headmaster exceiii for my size : fawn-colored pants , dark sack coat , satin vest , and patent-leather shoes . It was all right with Miss Berry , who you know was stuck on me , and if you think I had any trouble will , Luke English and his bunch you are wrong . Soon as I started i dress that way and put on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suck up to me in the most shameless fashion , with Luke foremost among them . Of course that meant the girls of the same age as well , and th. got to inviting me to their birthday parties and such , to which Ed come with a smirk and make sarcastic remarks even to their parent ' , as they officiated , and by God if I did n't hear more than one moth : , remark favorably on what a gentleman I was directly after I had i my mind insulted her . So the winter passed , and Mrs. Pendrake I reckon continued visit the back of the ice-cream parlor though I never followed h. again , on the grounds my heart would never stand it . For I tell yo I loved her . If anything , I loved her more than ever after lookiu , , through that shutter . I hated her , but I loved her for making rut hate her . I was imitating Kane because she loved him . I was runninn to the whores because I loved her .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kind of ng , you know how close it is connected to hopelessness and thus about the only thing in civilization that do n't degenerate with String came . It might have been April , for I recall a good deal rein fell the night before , but the following day was clear and lit and the magnolia tree in the Pendrakes ' front yard had ng all its pink cups . At around two in the afternoon a little scrawny fellow went into soda-water place , drug that Kane outside to the street , and beat half to death with a horsewhip. o , it was n't me . The man what did it was named John Weath , who owned a livery stable . He stood about five-five , was bald forty , and had a sixteen-year-old daughter I knowed slightly . It cd out Kane had knowed this girl too , only in the carnal way , had give her the start of a family of her very own . Kane never tried to defend himself , just covered up his face  --  I kon he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I dcrstand that frock coat of his was cut to ribbons . I did n't see the ident myself , but Luke English did and probably lied some in sting it . ( Kane might have been yellow , but I ca n't see him going n on his knees and sobbing like a child . ) I do know Kane rtly married the Weatherby girl , closed up his establishment , and veil to St. Louie . And then within another month or so , about the is she begun to swell , back she come , for he had give her the slip cc in the big city . " I believe that Kane would of screwed a snake if somebody 'd held head , " Luke observed . " Though I never realized that about him ilc he was here , didjoo ? I wonder who else 's wives , mothers , rs , and daughters he was ? " " Who cares , " says I and changed the subject . Luke 's mother and crs was the ugliest women in town . I hankered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They was n't visible , except she started staying home re in the afternoons again . She was sweetly sad as always , not I ink because of this particular disappointment but rather at the rural nature of living .

She might have been happy with cross-eyes or buck teeth t But the kind of fool I was , I went right back to my imaginal romance with her , forgot and forgave , read Mr. Pope again , and s on . I stopped visiting Mrs. Lizzie 's . When the warm weather conic , the Reverend suddenly grew aware of me as if I had been absent all winter , and allowed as how we should go fishing again . But by beini vague about it until the notion passed from his mind , I managed i elude that . So it was perfect and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May has retained the signification it acquired then though I never spent another in that fashion . But along about the first of June , instead of reading on that after noon , we walked down to the commercial district , Mrs. P. holding my arm , both of us real grand . She had decided I must have a nc pair of hoots . I already owned four or five , but she said the new bootncakcr was an amazing craftsman in leather , hailing from Flor cncc , Italy , and it was almost disgraceful not to wear the product of his hand , now such was available . So we went to the shop , which was owned by a flabby-faced individual named Cushing , who rushed up as we entered and all but kissed the floor underneath Mrs. P. The Italian bootmaker was at hi. , bench towards the back , a wiry , dark-complexioned fellow in hi middle twenties . He wore a leather jerkin without sleeves and watt hairy as an animal on the lower arms , and also I reckon the chest , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck was all curl black . Cushing fetches forth a pair of Russia-leather slippers Mrs. Pen drake had ordered earlier , unbeknownst to me . They were cunning little red things , for she had tiny feet . Cushing come almost to the point of slaver here , a woman 's foot in them days being thought almost unbearably sexy . " I supervised the dainty work myself , " he says . " You ca n't always ' , trust that Eye-talian when it comes to ladies ' items . You see this , stitching , madam ? " Mrs. P. says : " Would you be so good as to deliver them to my house , Mr. Cushing ? " " Oh ? " says he with a finger to the gold tooth of which he wt. , real proud . " Very well , madam , I 'll send the Eye-talian straight off . " " You must never do that , Mr. Cushing . I shall require Angelo take this young gentleman 's measurements for a pair of boots .

' 1 he difference was that Angelo kept his head down mostly , ctcd with them tight black curls , and if he glanced at Mrs. P. , his o as polite , innocent , and ignorant . Italians have the reputation hot blood , but he did n't even seem to be lukewarm . Furtherrr , he did n't have much English . He seemed to know two words : Iv " and " yes , " which he pronounced his own way . Shc said : " Angelo , I am very happy with these slippers . You have clr t hem as if you held my foot while you worked . " I lc answered : " Yayss , leddy . " " But , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyebrows . " Leddy ? " " But I think I had rather they were done in blue . Do n't you think c would become me more ? " " Yayss ? " he asked , all the while applying himself to the pattern of y hoof , and shortly had it done , for he was wondrously deft with fingers . I do n't think he savvied a word she said , but she nevertheless went about it and he nodded and said the usual and smiled empty and , aking a little bow , went back to his bench , where he picked up a ece of hide and sliced out a sole freehand almost in no longer than takes to tell it . ' I'nwards Angelo I have never borne any ill will . It 's hard to hate a rti:m on the basis of the one short time you saw him , when he appeared far more interested in leather than he ever could be in Mrs. I'cndrake . I was just worn out with the whole business . do along about three o'clock next morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the most usable clothes I could find , got my Money together  --  I had three-four dollars accumulated  --  put my scalping knife in my waistband , slipped down the stairs , and left forever .
